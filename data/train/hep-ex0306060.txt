    "spin interaction in quarkonia .",
    "the existing experimental knowledge is limited to the 117@xmath82 mev splitting between @xmath9(1@xmath10 ) and @xmath2(1@xmath1)@xcite .",
    "it is important to find out the magnitude of the corresponding splitting between the radial excitations @xmath11(2@xmath10 ) and @xmath0(2@xmath1 ) , which samples more confinement - dominated part of the @xmath12 potential whose spin dependence is open to speculation .",
    "the proximity of @xmath11 and @xmath0 to the @xmath13 breakup threshold also brings in channel  coupling effects .",
    "several searches for @xmath0 have been reported in the literature@xcite@xcite .",
    "the crystal ball collaboration at slac reported the identification of @xmath0 in the radiative decay of @xmath11@xcite .",
    "structure due to a purported @xmath14 of energy 91@xmath85 mev was interpreted as the signal for @xmath15 5 mev , and a 95% confidence level upper limit on its total width was set as 8 mev .",
    "the e760 experiment at fermilab made an unsuccessful search for @xmath0 in the reaction @xmath16 in the mass region 35913621 mev with @xmath176 pb@xmath4 of invested luminosity@xcite .",
    "they set a 90% confidence upper limit for @xmath18 of @xmath190.7 ev for assumed total widths between 5 and 10 mev .",
    "the search was repeated by the successor experiment e835 with the measurement with @xmath1730 pb@xmath4 of luminosity .",
    "no evidence for @xmath0 was found in the mass region 35753600 mev , and a 90% confidence upper limit for @xmath18 of @xmath190.7 ev was again set for assumed total widths @xmath2015 mev@xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the corresponding value for @xmath2 is @xmath219 ev , _",
    "i.e. , _ about an order of magnitude larger .",
    "the next search for @xmath0 was done by delphi in the @xmath22 fusion reaction @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "no signal was observed in the mass range of 35003800 mev , and a 90% confidence upper limit @xmath26 was set@xcite assuming equal decay branching ratios for @xmath2 and @xmath0 . in a similar search",
    "l3 established a 95% confidence limit of @xmath27@xcite .    recently",
    ", the belle collaboration has reported an @xmath0 signal with @xmath28@xmath29 significance in the decay of @xmath30 , with @xmath31 , from which they determined @xmath32 mev@xcite , and @xmath33= 15 @xmath34(stat ) mev .",
    "the belle collaboration also presented evidence at the @xmath35 level for an @xmath0 signal in the reaction @xmath36 , with @xmath37 mev@xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions for the mass and width of the @xmath0 meson have been so far based on potential model calculations and an analogy between the radial excitation pairs @xmath38/@xmath11 and @xmath2/@xmath0 .",
    "the predictions for masses range from @xmath39 mev to @xmath40 mev , and the predictions for the ratio of the two - photon partial widths , @xmath41 range from 0.38 to 0.77 .",
    "thus , the current best experimental results for both the mass and two  photon partial width of the @xmath0 are at variance with theoretical predictions .",
    "this makes for great interest in determining these parameters with precision .    at cleo",
    "we have searched for the @xmath0 meson in the final state @xmath42 via @xmath22 fusion in @xmath43 data at the @xmath44(4s ) resonance and its vicinity , using 13.4 fb@xmath4 of cleo ii / ii.v data .",
    "having observed strong evidence for the @xmath0 , we searched for its corroboration in 9.2 fb@xmath4 of cleo iii data .",
    "the observation of @xmath2 in the same reaction and decay channel was reported by cleo earlier@xcite .",
    "preliminary results of the present study were presented earlier  @xcite .",
    "the babar collaboration has also recently presented their preliminary results of the study of @xmath2 and @xmath0 production in the same reaction  @xcite .",
    "the layout of the paper is the following .",
    "section ii describes our data samples and event selection criteria .",
    "section iii discusses our analysis procedures , while section iv presents our estimates of systematic uncertainties .",
    "a summary of the results is given in section v.",
    "the cleo ii / ii.v data sample consists of 13.4 fb@xmath4 of @xmath43 luminosity .",
    "approximately one  third of the data were taken with the cleo ii configuration of the detector , and two  thirds with the cleo ii.v configuration .",
    "the total luminosity of cleo iii data used in the current analysis is 9.2 fb@xmath4 , @xmath45 of the cleo ii / ii.v luminosity .",
    "however , this newer data have the advantage of the superior hadron identification , as described below .",
    "the detector components most useful for this study were the concentric tracking devices for measurements of charged particles , operating in a 1.5 t superconducting solenoid .",
    "for cleo ii@xcite , this tracking system consisted of a 6layer straw tube chamber , a 10layer precision drift chamber , and a 51layer main drift chamber .",
    "the main drift chamber also provided measurements of the specific ionization loss , de / dx , used for particle identification .",
    "for cleo ii.v , the innermost chamber was removed and replaced with a three  layer silicon vertex detector@xcite ; in addition the gas in the main drift chamber was changed from a 5050 mixture of argon  ethane to 6040 helium  propane .    for cleo iii@xcite , the entire charged particle tracking system was replaced .",
    "the new tracking system consists of four layers of double - sided silicon strip detector , surrounded by a new , 47-layer drift chamber with a smaller outer diameter@xcite .",
    "careful design optimization led to the momentum resolution of this tracking system comparable to that of cleoii / ii.v .",
    "the cleoii time - of - flight system was eliminated and in the space created by it and the smaller drift chamber a ring imaging cerenkov detector ( rich)@xcite was installed .",
    "the rich distinguishes charged kaons from pions over 80% of the solid angle , which is smaller than hadron identification with de / dx . for charged tracks with momenta below 2 gev / c ( the momentum range of most of our kaon candidates ) the rich identifies kaons with efficiency greater than 81% while having less than 2% probability that a pion is misidentified as a kaon .",
    "in addition , the trigger for cleoiii was improved in its flexibility , efficiency , and redundancy .",
    "given that it relies on fewer types of devices with better design than in cleoii , the trigger is also easier to reliably simulate .",
    "the monte carlo simulation of cleo detector response was based upon geant .",
    "simulated events were processed in the same manner as the data to determine the @xmath42 detection efficiency .",
    "efficiencies obtained in this fashion are listed for major selection criteria for both cleo ii / ii.v and cleo iii in table  [ tb : effi3 ] .",
    "the overall detection efficiency for @xmath0 is 13.8%(cleo ii ) and 11.6%(cleo iii ) .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     also of interest is the two - photon partial width of the @xmath0 as compared to that of the @xmath2 .",
    "the ratio of the number of events of @xmath0 and @xmath2 is :    @xmath46    here , for the cleo ii / ii.v analysis :    @xmath47 is the ratio of @xmath0 and @xmath2 events from table  [ tb : results ] @xmath48 is the ratio of the two  photon fluxes at the @xmath0 and @xmath2 masses , as calculated using the known two  photon flux function@xcite .",
    "this ratio has a systematic uncertainty of @xmath82% .",
    "@xmath49 is the ratio of efficiencies as calculated from monte carlo simulation , and is shown in table  [ tb : effi3 ] .    using these values in the equation above ,",
    "we obtain    @xmath50    performing this same calculation for the cleo iii data , we obtain @xmath51 , which is preliminary but consistent with the cleo ii / ii.v result .",
    "the systematic uncertainties in the cleo iii results are still being investigated ; therefore we only discuss those for the cleo ii / ii.v analysis below .",
    "we estimate systematic uncertainties on our mass determinations with the following considerations .",
    "@xmath52 it is difficult to estimate the contributions to systematic biases which arise from different choices of event selection when statistical uncertainties dominate .",
    "however , the statistical errors in the @xmath2 peak are much smaller than those of the @xmath0 peak , and we consider the extreme variation in @xmath2 mass in the different event selections we have attempted as providing an upper limit of 1 mev as the systematic uncertainty due to event selections .",
    "@xmath52 we have made a monte carlo study of how the masses of @xmath2 and @xmath0 shift between the input values and those obtained after the detector simulation .",
    "for an input mass and width of @xmath53=2980 mev , @xmath54=27 mev , the shift , @xmath55 , is 0.9@xmath80.6 mev . with an input mass and width of @xmath53=3640 mev , @xmath54=15 mev ,",
    "the shift , @xmath56 , is 0.7@xmath80.3 mev .",
    "we conclude that the systematic error due to this source is @xmath81.0 mev .",
    "@xmath52 we have also tested how the masses of the particles that can be reconstructed compare with their known masses .",
    "we find that the reconstructed mass @xmath57=497.69@xmath80.06 mev .",
    "the pdg@xcite value is @xmath57=497.67@xmath80.03 mev .",
    "this small deviation , @xmath58=0.02@xmath80.07 mev , is consistent with the conclusions reached for the mass of the @xmath9 meson , namely @xmath59=0.4@xmath80.4 mev , which was measured separately .",
    "we therefore conclude that the absolute calibration of our mass scale has an uncertainty of @xmath201.0 mev .",
    "@xmath52 it is possible that the choice of background shape effects the mass determination . from the fits made with polynomial , power ",
    "law , and exponential backgrounds we find that @xmath60 varies by @xmath200.7 mev , and @xmath61 varies by @xmath200.1 mev .",
    "we therefore estimate that this source contributes @xmath20 1.0 mev to the systematic uncertainty in masses of @xmath2 and @xmath0 .    adding the above contributions in quadrature we determine the systematic uncertainty in the mass of @xmath0 to be @xmath202 mev .",
    "we note , however , that @xmath2 mass obtained in the present study ( table ii ) differs from our earlier published result@xcite by @xmath174 mev .",
    "provided this difference , we assign the systematic uncertainty in our measurement as @xmath84 mev , at present .",
    "studies are being made to understand the mass difference , and we expect that systematic uncertainties at the level of @xmath82 mev will be achieved in the final results .",
    "this value of @xmath63 cited earlier was obtained using second order polynomial function for the background .",
    "the major source of systematic uncertainty in the ratio @xmath63 is found to be the choice of background shape .",
    "the values in case of power  law and exponential backgrounds is essentially the same , @xmath64 and @xmath65 . as our final result for @xmath63 we quote the average of the extreme values and assign the difference as systematic error . the systematic error due to efficiency ratio was @xmath172% , which is negligible .",
    "thus ,    @xmath66",
    "we have analyzed 13.4 fb@xmath4 of @xmath43 data of cleo ii / ii.v and 9.2 fb@xmath4 data of cleo iii at @xmath44(4s ) and its vicinity for resonances in the reaction @xmath67 .    in the @xmath68 invariant mass plot resulting from the cleo ii / ii.v data",
    ", we see an excess of events at mass of @xmath173643 mev with the significance level of over 4@xmath69 in addition to @xmath2 .",
    "we attribute this excess to the excitation of the @xmath0 resonance .",
