    "one of the distinctive features of blazar agn is rapid flux variability , which is seen in every region of the electro - magnetic spectrum ( wagner & witzel 1995 ) .",
    "this variability can be on time - scales as short as hours to minutes  in this case , it is termed `` micro - variability '' . in the optical , these variations",
    "can be of the order of @xmath2 mag per night ( see the review by miller & noble 1996 ) .",
    "while some radio - quiet quasars have been shown to exhibit micro - variability ( jang & miller 1997 ) , it is seen most commonly in radio - loud ( mostly blazar - type ) agn .",
    "the duty cycle for radio - loud agn is @xmath3 ( romero et al .",
    "1999 ) and the figure may be even higher ( @xmath4 ) for radio - selected bl lacs ( heidt & wagner 1996 ) .    for radio - quiet agn ,",
    "the situation is less clear .",
    "romero et al.(1999 ) found a low duty cycle of @xmath5 .",
    "gopal - krishna et al.(2000 ) , in their extensive study of micro - variability of radio - quiet qsos , found that about 31% of the objects showed evidence for variability .",
    "they suggest that radio - quiet qsos are less likely to exhibit micro - variability in a given time - span than radio - loud agn , and that the character of the variations in the two classes tend to be different",
    ". however , de diego et al .  (",
    "1998 ) , in a comparative study of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars found that micro - variations may be as common in radio - quiet quasars as radio - loud quasars .",
    "while the micro - variations in radio - loud objects are thought to be due to shocks within the jet , the existence of similar variability in radio - quiet objects indicates that the accretion disk may also be important in producing the variations .",
    "we are conducting an on - going study of the optical and near - infrared emission from objects from the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample ( phfs , drinkwater et al .",
    "1997 ) , with the data and modelling already presented in francis , whiting & webster ( 2000 , hereafter fww ) and whiting , webster & francis ( 2001 , hereafter wwf ) respectively .",
    "based on the above estimates for micro - variability duty - cycles , it is reasonable to expect to see micro - variability in quasars and bl lacs from the phfs .",
    "this paper contains an investigation into the existence of micro - variability in three such sources .",
    "we choose three objects from the phfs to search for micro - variability at near - infrared wavelengths  a wavelength region that has rarely been used for such a study . with the above figures ,",
    "if three objects are observed there is a probability of @xmath6 of seeing micro - variability in at least one source .",
    "we also choose objects with different optical / nir spectra , so that we have both jet - dominated and accretion disk - dominated sources .",
    "this will enable a comparison of the two ideas for the production of micro - variability .",
    "on the night of the 3rd of august , 1999 , three agn from the phfs were observed multiple times in three nir filters over the course of @xmath7 hours , in an attempt to detect short time - scale micro - variability .",
    "the observations were made in the near - infrared with the caspir @xmath8 insb array camera ( mcgregor et al .",
    "1994 ) on the australian national university s 2.3 m telescope , at siding spring observatory , nsw .",
    "the images were taken using the fast camera with 0.5/pixel , and thus the entire detector spans a little over 2 arcmin .",
    "the three objects chosen were the following :    * * pks 2243@xmath0123 : * a quasar , @xmath9 , that was described as optically variable by shen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , although they did not give a reference for this classification ( it possibly comes from the description as variable in hewitt & burbidge ( 1993 ) ) .",
    "it has a blue optical / nir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from fww , with @xmath10 .",
    "wwf modelled the seds of many phfs sources by fitting a combination of a blue power law plus a synchrotron model with a turn - over .",
    "this source was best fit with a power law of the form @xmath11 , and showed no evidence for synchrotron emission in its optical / nir sed .",
    "the optical spectrum of the source shows strong broad balmer lines and  lines of small equivalent width ( tadhunter et al .",
    "* * pks 2240@xmath0260 : * a bl lac object at @xmath12 .",
    "it has a redder optical / nir sed ( @xmath13 from fww , and is fitted by wwf with a strong synchrotron component ) .",
    "high optical polarisation has been observed in this source ( @xmath14 , wills et al .",
    "( 1992 ) ) , and only weak , if any , emission lines have been seen .",
    "this object was seen to exhibit optical intra - day variability by heidt & wagner ( 1996 ) . *",
    "* pks 2233@xmath0148 : * a candidate for a bl lac ( according to padovani & giommi ( 1995 ) ) , at @xmath15 .",
    "( the redshift of @xmath16 quoted in johnston et al .  ( 1995 ) and on ned appears to be due to a mis - reading of a table in schmidt & green ( 1983 ) . )",
    "this has a similar optical / nir sed to pks 2240@xmath0260 , also dominated by synchrotron emission .",
    "the multi - wavelength ( radio  x - ray ) sed for each source is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - sed ] , while three - colour images of each of the sources are shown in fig .  [ fig - idv - sources ] , indicating the location of the source , as well as nearby stars that were used in the analysis ( see section  [ sec - var ] for details ) .",
    "these sources were chosen primarily on the basis of their position on the sky ( to enable constant observations for the second half of a night , and to minimise the time required for the telescope to move between each source ) , and also to examine the potential for micro - variability in both bl lacs ( pks 2240@xmath0260 and pks 2233@xmath0148 ) and blue radio - loud quasars ( pks 2243@xmath0123 ) .",
    "these objects were observed in three filters : @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . each source was observed eight times in each filter .",
    "each of the images is comprised of @xmath20 dithered 60 second images , each made up of twelve averaged 5 sec exposures in @xmath19 , six averaged 10 sec exposures in @xmath18 , and two averaged 30 sec exposures in @xmath17 .",
    "the flat field was created from the difference of dome exposures with the lamps on and off  this removes any telescope emission , improving greatly the photometric accuracy .",
    "the sky emission was removed by using a median of the four dithered images of the same band taken at the same time .",
    "the four images were then aligned and combined using the median ( to remove any residual errors ) .",
    "the photometry was done with the _ apphot _ package in iraf , using circular apertures with the sky background level determined by the median flux in an annulus around the source .",
    "several different sizes of aperture were used to make sure the underlying host galaxy was not affecting the observed variability .",
    "no significant difference was seen for the different aperture sizes  the results presented here use an aperture of 5 .",
    "the seeing varied from @xmath21 over the course of the night .",
    "the errors in the photometry shown on the light - curves are purely the random errors from the photometry calculations .",
    "in order to construct light - curves for each of the sources , the differential magnitude of the quasar is measured relative to comparison stars in the same field .",
    "this differential magnitude is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the magnitudes of the quasar and the comparison star respectively .",
    "this differential magnitude is then compared to the comparison differential magnitude @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the magnitude of a second comparison star in the same field .",
    "this second differential magnitude acts as a check  a change in flux in the quasar will change @xmath27 but not @xmath28 , while a change that occurs in both will not be intrinsic to the quasar .",
    "the light - curves are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig - idv1][fig - idv3 ] . for clarity ,",
    "they are offset from each other and plotted with their own vertical scale , relative to the initial point .",
    "the zero points for these scales are given in table  [ tab - idv - offset ] .",
    ".offsets for the micro - variability light - curves presented in figs .",
    "[ fig - idv1][fig - idv3 ] . to obtain the correct differential magnitude for each light - curve ,",
    "add the corresponding number from the table to the values in the figure . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the origin of optical and nir micro - variability in blazar agn is not very well understood .",
    "there are two main types of models that have been developed to explain the observations .",
    "firstly , there are models that use a shock - in - jet setup .",
    "this type of model has been used to explain the radio variability seen in blazars ( marscher & gear 1985 ) . to produce the optical micro - variability ,",
    "a thin relativistic shock within a jet encounters a feature , such as a bend in the jet or an inhomogeneity in the density , which causes an enhancement of the observed jet emission ( see , for example , gopal - krishna & wiita ( 1992 ) or qian et al .",
    "( 1991 ) ) .",
    "a second suggestion for the cause of micro - variability moves away from the jet and looks instead at the accretion disk .",
    "perturbations or instabilities on the surface of an accretion disk ( such as `` hot - spots ''  regions of high temperature and/or density ) can create micro - variations in the emission ( see mangalam & wiita ( 1993 ) and references therein ) .",
    "it is likely that both models are important for micro - variability in agn , and the relative importance for individual sources depends on the relative strengths of the jet and disk emission .",
    "the quasar pks 2243@xmath0123 has a blue optical / nir sed ( the photometry from these observations gives the same nir slope as the photometry presented in fww , and is modelled in wwf by a blue power law ) .",
    "it thus shows no evidence for synchrotron emission in its optical spectrum ( a fact also supported by its observed strong emission lines ) .",
    "hence , it is unlikely that fluctuations in the jet emission will cause the observed micro - variations , unless the jet is present at a very low level and experiences relatively large fluctuations .",
    "it seems then that the micro - variability in this source is more likely to be explained by the accretion disk instability model .    to test this statement",
    ", we can take the model fitting from wwf to an extreme , so that a synchrotron component is fit along with a very blue ( @xmath29 ) power law .",
    "this generates the maximum amount of synchrotron flux according to this model .",
    "the amount of synchrotron as a proportion of total flux in the near - infrared ranges from 3.4% ( at @xmath17 band ) to 5.4% ( at @xmath19 band ) .",
    "if we assume that the synchrotron component is the only component that is varying , then to produce the observed fluctuations , the synchrotron component must vary in flux by a factor of at least 7 ( on a time - scale of about an hour ) .",
    "the accretion disk instability model allows us to avoid such extreme variability , and is consistent with observations of micro - variability in radio - quiet quasars ( e.g.  gopal - krishna et al.2000 ) .",
    "finally , since the observations presented here were limited in scope ( due to the time available ) , a follow - up study would be quite worthwhile .",
    "such a study should involve selecting a small sample of quasars ( and bl lacs ) that has some sources with synchrotron dominated seds ( this part of the sample would contain the bl lacs , based on the modelling in wwf ) , and some with blue power law seds ( in the manner of pks 2243@xmath0123 ) .",
    "the observations would ideally cover a greater period of time than that described in this paper , to increase the probability of seeing variability .",
    "this would also enable a better determination of the nature and structure of the variability .",
    "the relative amounts of micro - variability in the two types of sources could then be gauged accurately , particularly in light of our detection of micro - variability in the blue quasar .",
    "this would hopefully give an indication of how important each model is for micro - variability in all types of radio - loud agn .",
    "we wish to thank the two anonymous referees for their helpful comments , and the mssso tac for granting us the time on the 2.3 m telescope .",
