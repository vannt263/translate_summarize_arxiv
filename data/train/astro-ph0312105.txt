    "the high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ; wakker & van woerden 1997 ) seen in  21 cm emission are characterized by significant deviation from a simple model of differential galactic rotation . although they are thought to reside in the galactic halo , their origin within the context of galaxy assembly is not well understood .",
    "the fact that a large fraction of hvcs exhibit negative velocity centroids in the local standard of rest ( lsr ) , and the need to explain the metallicity distribution of long - lived stars in the solar neighborhood ( flynn & morell 1997 ) , have motivated the suggestion that these hvcs represent the accretion of low - metallicity gas onto the galaxy ( wakker et al .",
    "1999 ; collins , shull , & giroux 2003 , hereafter csg ) .",
    "negative velocity hvcs may be condensed remnants of a `` galactic fountain '' ( shapiro & field 1976 ; bregman 1980 ) now returning to the disk .",
    "an alternate , but controversial hypothesis places some of the hvcs at locations in the local group ( blitz et al .",
    "1999 ) , perhaps 500 kpc distant , and identifies the compact hvcs ( chvcs ) in particular as a population of dwarf - type galaxies at large distance ( braun & burton 1999 ) .",
    "however , evidence supporting this hypothesis has not been forthcoming , since both a stellar component to the chvcs ( simon & blitz 2002 ; hopp , schulte - ladbeck , & kerp 2003 ) and similar  clouds in nearby groups ( zwaan 2001 ) have yet to be detected .",
    "recent h@xmath12 detections of hvcs and chvcs indicate that many of these objects are within a @xmath13 kpc radius of the galaxy ( putman et al .",
    "in addition , models suggest that many chvcs at local group distances would have unreasonably large total masses , summing the neutral , ionized , and dark matter ( maloney & putman 2003 ) .",
    "this discussion of hvc location within the galaxy halo or local group has expanded to include a population of hvcs ( sembach et al .",

    "cosmological simulations predict that the collapse of gas during galaxy formation should produce significant amounts of shock - heated gas ( cen & ostriker 1999 ) in the low - redshift intergalactic medium ( igm ) , the so - called warm - hot igm or whim .",

    "these absorbers exhibited strong  absorption accompanied by little or no absorption in low ions .",

    "in addition , emission associated with the galactic center negative ( gcn ) clouds can be detected at similar velocities to the hvcs within @xmath18 of the sight lines , indicating a possible association between the hvcs and the gcn clouds .",
    "the column density constraints from the ghrs data were successfully modeled as arising from an extragalactic qso - type radiation field .",
    "the resulting densities , pressures , and sizes of the clouds suggested to s99 that these hvcs were most likely located in the local group or distant galactic halo , and that the highly ionized gas traces the outer , low - density regions of the hvcs .",

    "the quality of the ghrs data led s99 to conclude , however , that these clouds show little or no detectable low ion absorption .",

    "profiles of  absorption lines in this sight line are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the column of the @xmath2 km s@xmath3 component is sufficiently low that unsaturated absorption can be detected in ly@xmath52 , with the component eventually becoming undetectable at ly@xmath53 . owing to blending with saturated galactic  absorption , only lines from ly@xmath54 through ly@xmath35 are useful for measuring the  column of the @xmath1 km s@xmath3 component .",
    "equivalent width measurements of the lyman lines for the hvc components are shown in table 3 , for four and five  lines for the @xmath2 and @xmath1 km s@xmath3 components , respectively .",

    "5 ) to determine the corresponding  column densities of these components , log@xmath10()@xmath55 for the @xmath1 km s@xmath3 component and log@xmath10()@xmath56 for the @xmath2 km s@xmath3 component .",
    "this is a significant improvement over the work of s99 , where only an upper limit could be determined based on single - dish  emission data .",
    "these low hvc column densities show why no 21-cm emission was detected .",
    "profiles of metal ion absorption lines observed in the _ fuse _ and stis data are shown in figure 6 .",
    "the data quality is not as good as that for pks 2155@xmath0304 , but high - velocity absorption can be detected . as with pks 2155@xmath0304 ,",
    "the profiles show two distinct high - velocity components . in the mrk 509 sight line",
    ", however , the stronger component appears at higher velocity , @xmath57 km s@xmath3 ( centered at @xmath58 km s@xmath3 ) , than the weak component , which can only be detected at the 3@xmath59 level in a few absorption lines .",
    "the weak component is most obvious in @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "these lines are used to establish an integration range of @xmath62 km s@xmath3 ( centered at @xmath63 km s@xmath3 ) for the weak component .",
    "the @xmath64 absorption from the @xmath63 km s@xmath3 component is contaminated by weak absorption from the l(6 - 0 ) p(3 ) galactic h@xmath37 line . the nearby l(7 - 0 ) p(3 ) line has a similar oscillator strength to the l(6 - 0 ) p(3 ) line . to remove this contamination , we inferred the optical depth of the contaminating line by scaling the integrated @xmath44 of the galactic h@xmath37 l(7 - 0 ) p(3 ) line by its relative value of @xmath65 . the line width of the galactic h@xmath37 l(7 - 0 ) p(3 )",
    "is then used to subtract off the appropriate integrated @xmath44 for the contaminating absorption .",
    "the resulting  profile looks reasonable , although the removal of the h@xmath37 line has effectively smoothed over any possible small - scale structure .    the _ fuse _ sic channel data are so poor that we could not obtain measurements of lines below 1000   or between 1080@xmath01100  .",
    "thus , our results do not include column density measurements based on @xmath66 , @xmath67 , or the lyman lines .",
    "the lack of an measurement is perhaps most critical , and we were unable to improve on the upper limit from single - dish emission data of log@xmath10()@xmath68 established by sembach et al .",

    "measured equivalent widths and column densities for each of the high - velocity components in the mrk 509 sight line are shown in table 4 .",
    "the column density pattern is similar to the hvcs in the pks 2155@xmath0304 sight line .",
    "the core of the  @xmath69 profile for the @xmath58 km s@xmath3 component is likely saturated , and the measured column density should be considered a lower limit .",
    "although saturation is not apparent in the  and  profiles , it is possible that unresolved saturation can be an issue , since the weak lines give @xmath70 dex larger column densities for the @xmath58 km s@xmath3 component . in order to test for unresolved saturation",
    ", we compared the profiles of the weak and strong lines in the  and  doublets . if saturation were an issue , the aod method should give a larger and more peaked column density for the weak line than for the optically thicker strong line .",
    "figure 7 shows the normalized column density profiles of the and doublets for the @xmath58 km s@xmath3 component .",
    "clearly , unresolved saturation may be present , since the profiles from the weaker lines of the doublets are more peaked between @xmath58 and @xmath71 km s@xmath3 . due to the presence of saturation , a cog fit to the doublets",
    "is used to measure the column densities of and .",
    "since the feature at @xmath72 km s@xmath3 in the   @xmath73 profile is not observed in the @xmath74 profile , we suspect that this feature is a result of spurious absorption in the integration range .",
    "therefore , absorption from this feature is not included in the @xmath75 measurement of  @xmath73 .",
    "an obvious characteristic of these hvcs is their strong absorption in highly - ionized species ( c  iv , si  iv ) .",
    "furthermore , except for the @xmath1 km  s@xmath3 component ( pks  2155@xmath0304 ) , the column densities of singly - ionized and neutral species are quite low or below the detection limit .",

    "the mean of the column densities obtained from the  doublet is used for the hvcs toward pks 2155@xmath0304 since saturation is not present .",
    "we have considered three approaches for the ionization of these hvcs , which are discussed individually below .",
    "the first approach we consider is that the hvcs are in the galactic halo ( @xmath89 kpc ) and photoionized by stars in the disk . for energetic reasons , uv photons from massive stars in the disk",
    "are thought to be responsible for ionizing a significant majority of the ionized gas in the galaxy and low halo ( reynolds 1993 ) .",
    "some hvcs have been detected in h@xmath12 ( tufte et al .",
    "2002 ) , and the assumption of photoionization by stars in the disk is often used to constrain their distances ( bland - hawthorn & maloney 2002 ) . in order to examine the measured column densities , we have generated a grid of photoionization models using the code cloudy ( ferland 1996 ) .",
    "we make the simplifying assumption that the absorbing gas can be treated as plane - parallel slabs illuminated by incident radiation dominated by ob associations .",
    "the models assume a kurucz model atmosphere ( @xmath90  k ) and include metallicity as a free parameter , although the relative abundance pattern is assumed to be solar .",
    "studies of h@xmath12 emission measures of various hvcs have been argued ( bland - hawthorn & putman 2001 ; weiner , vogel , & williams 2002 ) to be consistent with radiation from our galaxy at the level of log @xmath91 ( photons @xmath17 s@xmath3 ) , where @xmath92 is the normally incident ionizing photon flux . since the intensity of the field is fixed , we run models for a range of different ionization parameter , @xmath93 , by varying the hydrogen number density within the cloud ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "the cloudy models generated using a stellar ionizing spectrum are generally successful at predicting the measured column densities of the singly ionized and neutral species .",
    "we find three generic failures of these photoionization models : ( 1 ) all species doubly ionized and higher are underpredicted by models in which the low - ionization species are used to constrain the field ; ( 2 ) for any reasonable value of the ionization parameter , @xmath93 , the stellar photoionization models produce very low ionization fractions of  relative to ; ( 3 ) these photoionization models are unable to produce the observed amount of .",
    "clearly , if the gas is photoionized , the radiation field must be harder than that produced by massive stars ( the ionization potential is @xmath95 ev or 8.4 ryd ) .      since a hard spectrum ionizing source is required to explain the ionization pattern in these hvcs , a likely source is the integrated radiation from background qsos and agn .",
    "this approach assumes , in effect , that the hvcs are at large distances from the galactic plane ( @xmath96 kpc ) so that contributions from ob - star radiation escaping the galaxy are minimal ( giroux & shull 1997 ) .",
    "we use the same cloudy method as above , though we adopt a typical extragalactic radiation field with log @xmath97 ( photons @xmath17 s@xmath3 ) and a power - law spectrum with a spectral index of @xmath98 ( zheng et al .",

    "we explored the possibility of a harder field by adopting @xmath104 , which was also inadequate in replicating the observations .",
    "although such a spectrum is able to produce more ( 8.4 ryd radiation ) , it does so at the expense of lower ions which are still observed at high column density .",
    "additionally , we have explored models incorporating an extragalactic x - ray background .",

    "since the fits to the observations are valid over a fairly narrow range in @xmath93 , the metallicity and other properties can then be constrained by the uncertainty in @xmath10 ( ) and the use of the column density scaling law . in accordance with that scaling law , we have performed model calculations for the pks 2155@xmath0304 hvc components over the range of uncertainty in @xmath10 ( ) . since only weak upper limits , log n ( ) @xmath114 , can be derived for the hvcs toward mrk 509 , the parameter space of photoionization models is not well constrained .",

    "we further suggest that neither the physics of the highly ionized gas nor its connection to the neutral and low ionization gas are adequately understood .",
    "we believe that the strong absorption in these ionized hvcs requires a significant contribution from collisional ionization .",
    "as demonstrated above , the observed column densities of species ionized below  in these hvcs can be explained by photoionization from an extragalactic background produced by qsos and agn . in the absence of an unusually hard ionizing field ,",

    "we have therefore calculated the expected column densities based on @xmath10 ( ) in the collisionally ionized regions .",

    "such velocity shear has been seen in the bow shocks toward many herbig - haro objects ( hartigan , raymond , & hartmann 1987 ) , and may be reflected in the broad ( @xmath146 km  s@xmath3 ) profiles of .",
