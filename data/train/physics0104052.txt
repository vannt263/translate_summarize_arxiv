    "the simulation of realistic models of cell membranes is of the utmost importance , if not for immediate medical use , certainly for the development of new conceptual and practical tools in the application of molecular dynamics ( md ) methods to these and similarly complex systems .",
    "a lot of research activity has gone in this direction ( see for instance  @xcite and references therein ) , but we are still far from having a complete understanding of the dynamic and thermodynamic properties of this kind of systems , not to mention the problem of simulating the formation and the dynamics of pores and ion channels ( see , however , the recent very interesting work of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    to predict the structure of molecular layers in different physico - chemical conditions by computer simulations ,",
    "several modeling strategies have been proposed and investigated . among them",
    "we would like to mention the following .",
    "\\1 ) atomistic detailed approaches in which bilayer constituent molecules , water and possible counter - ions are modeled explicitly in full detail .",
    "the interaction between electrostatic point charges are evaluated through ewald related summation techniques , while the bias due to the use of periodic boundary conditions is reduced by performing simulations in extended _",
    "ensembles_. recent examples of this kind of investigations can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "\\2 ) simplified models of structures formed by surfactants have been constructed that retain some of the essential interactions between the constituent particles , like the lennard - jones ( lj ) forces among the hydrophobic tails and between solvent and hydrophilic molecular heads . on top of them",
    "ad hoc _ repulsive soft core describing the interaction between hydrophobic and hydrophilic particles is added to allow self - assembling of micelles and bilayers  @xcite .",
    "\\3 ) models in which only a single molecule or chain is modeled explicitly in terms of a realistic all - atom description , while the effect of the remainder of the system is parametrized by a mean - field deterministic force plus appropriate random forces",
    ". models of this type are successfully treated by monte carlo simulations and/or stochastic techniques . in this context",
    "we wish to recall the fairly good agreement with experiments obtained in the evaluation of the nmr deuterium order parameters in the case of lipid bilayers , when brownian dynamics is used for their simulations  @xcite .",
    "\\4 ) in the field of liquid crystals , where certain properties of layers often can be explored only through computer simulations , even more simplified force - fields , like that proposed by gay and berne  @xcite ( gb hereafter ) with the successive modifications of refs .  @xcite and  @xcite , are used . despite their simplicity",
    "these models allow the exploration and the study of various phases of the system , including smectic phases characterized by a number of different tilt angles .",
    "comparing different models and trying to assess the effects of the various contributions that are included or neglected in different instances , is not a simple task .",
    "an example of this situation is the comparison between the gb potential  @xcite and its closest lj representation .",
    "the gb potential was originally devised so as to mimic the interaction between two identical linear arrays composed by four lj sites each .",
    "the properties of a fluid made of gb particles turn out to be rather different from its lj counterpart : the gb fluid has a phase diagram with a well characterized nematic - isotropic transition temperature , while apparently the lj counterpart does not show any phase transition of this kind when only the temperature is varied .",
    "this is a case where the use of a simplified potential , far from leading to an impoverishment of the model , turns out to give rise to an unexpected and very interesting thermodynamic behaviour .    in the case of lipid molecules the comparison among different modeling strategies",
    "are much more difficult because of the occurrence of different types of interaction sites ( head , tail and solvent ) and because of the special importance of the internal molecular degrees of freedom , that may greatly influence the inter - molecular interactions , as well as the related hydrophobic tail packing and bilayer stability properties .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to perform md simulations of a simplified , but still sufficiently rich model of molecular bilayer in vacuum .",
    "the bilayer constituents are branched molecules composed by lj sites with the topology and the internal flexibility of the two fatty acid tails and glycerol group of the _ dimyristoyl - phosphatidylcholine _",
    "( dmpc hereafter ) molecule . in the absence of water ,",
    "the charged part of the dmpc head has been replaced by a methyl group ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schema1 ] ) .",
    "groups are labeled progressively in the standard way.,width=302 ]    with respect to an all - atom description of dmpc bilayers  @xcite , we retain in the model only the lj interactions between the most hydrophobic portions of the lipid molecules together their intra - molecular flexibility .",
    "these simplifications allow us to single out and investigate the role of repulsive - dispersive interactions in the structure of the bilayer , without the complications arising when electrostatic interactions among heads and solvent are present , which substantially limit the length of the simulated trajectories .    owing to these circumstances we are able to generate very long trajectories ( up to @xmath410  ns ) of sufficiently large systems , which allow us not only to expose and control certain effects related to the slow equilibration of the system ( which would be important sources of systematic errors in the analysis of simulations not sufficiently longer than 1  ns ) , but also to accurately check the physical consistency of the parameters of the employed intra - molecular potential .",
    "we notice that in the simplified approach we present in this paper the bilayer components are not really amphiphilic .",
    "this is not , however , a completely silly approximation .",
    "we have checked , in fact , that the system configurations , occurring at the lowest density we have explored , in which it happens that some of the molecule tails are turned up - side - down , have approximately the same potential energy as the physical situation in which the tails of the molecules of the two layers are in contact .",
    "we find instead that at the surface density of both the crystal and gel phases the energy barrier which should be overcome by a molecule to rotate up - side - down by @xmath5  degrees is sufficiently high to prevent this event to occur in the whole range of temperatures we have explored .",
    "this observation makes us confident that the predictions we have for the structural properties of the system in these two phases are fully reliable .",
    "as we said the situation , is completely different at our lowest density , which corresponds to that of the liquid - crystal phase .",
    "evidently in this case the potential barrier is not sufficiently high , as we witness the crossing of it by some of the molecules . despite this unphysical feature",
    ", we remark that our bilayer model remains stable at all the values of temperature and density we have studied ( even at the lowest one ) , in the sense that , thanks to the strong attractive interactions between the two layers , none of the molecules leaves the layers .",
    "we also notice that at low surface density the potential energy of the whole system is presumably smaller than it would be if the repulsion between solvent and tails were introduced . in models",
    "in which solvatation effects are included  @xcite low density configurations are essentially inaccessible , precisely because of a substantial solvent - tail repulsion .",
    "given the crudeness of our bilayer model , we do not expect to be able to accurately predict thermodynamic parameters , like the dependence of the surface density or the magnitude of the stress tensor  @xcite as functions of the temperature , mainly because of the lack of the interactions that govern the structure of the solvent interface and the absence of terms in the force - field that would prevent the tendency to isotropization at much too low surface densities we have mentioned above .",
    "therefore , in order to study the physics of the different phases of our bilayer model , we decided to fix the surface density at the experimentally estimated values ( @xmath0-simulations ) , rather than trying to work in an extended _ ensemble _ at fixed ( lateral ) pressure .",
    "as for the role of water , we tentatively assume that , once the bilayer is formed in the polar fluid , its structural and thermodynamic behaviour will be mainly governed by the packing and flexibility properties of the hydrocarbon tails  @xcite .",
    "most of the effects of water on the detailed physico - chemical behaviour of the membrane are indeed of secondary importance for the kind of questions we are addressing here . in the picture",
    "we have in mind , in fact , water is only important in that it behaves as a sticky medium for the lipid heads , which modulates the surface density by more or less penetrating into the bilayer  @xcite .",
    "thus water penetration is held responsible for the difference one sees in the increase of disorder in the head region , as compared to what happens to the tails , only to the extent it affects the surface density of the bilayer .",
    "the different behaviour between heads and tails may in turn be at the origin of the great sensitivity of the structure of the phase diagram to molecular composition and tail length",
    ".    even in the simplified model we are considering here , the known crystal structure of the glycerol group and fatty acid tails of dmpc  @xcite is well accommodated in a local minimum of the force - field we are using , at the appropriate surface density .",
    "the comparison of our results with those of more refined models can be of great help in understanding the relevance of more realistic modelizations of the molecular components of the system and/or the role of water .",
    "the md simulations we have performed extend over a rather fine grid in the temperature - density plane .",
    "thanks to this resolution and to the large statistics we have collected , we are able to draw interesting conclusions on the role of lj interactions and internal flexibility on the stability and the structural properties of the crystal and gel phases of our bilayer model",
    ".    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the model of bilayer we have constructed and investigated . in section 3 we discuss the details of our simulation strategy and in section 4 we report the most significant results we have obtained with a special emphasis on the information we have collected concerning structure and properties of the crystal and gel phases of the system .",
    "conclusions can be found in section 5 .",
    "schematically , a cell membrane can be described as an almost spherical bilayer consisting of phospho - lipid molecules which separates the interior of the cell from the external world .",
    "phospho - lipids are molecules composed by a hydrophilic head and one or two hydrophobic tails .",
    "these peculiar hydropathicity properties lead to the well known two - sheet structure of the membrane , in which the hydrophilic heads are in contact with water , present both outside and inside the cell , while the hydrophobic tails are more or less tail - to - tail pair - wise aligned .",
    "it appears experimentally that an important parameter governing the reaction rate of many biological processes , taking place inside or in the near vicinity of a membrane , is its  permeability \"  @xcite . from this point of view a membrane",
    "can be thought as a system made out of two layers of a smectic fluid , with a permeability which depends  critically \" on temperature , density , the detailed chemical composition of the constituent phospho - lipids , the concentration of chemicals possibly dispersed in the membrane itself or in the solvent , etc .",
    "it is clear that a detailed simulation of the dynamics of the membrane of a living cell is just impossible and one has to resort to a number of simplifications .",
    "a fortunate circumstance in this respect is that it appears experimentally that the nature and the location of the phase transitions , which control a number of important physico - chemical properties of the membrane , are essentially related to the bulk ordering properties of the hydrophobic tails  @xcite .",
    "thus a first step in the direction of simulating a realistic system , and the one which has been also largely followed in the literature  @xcite , is to take a two sheet system , each consisting of the largest possible number of lipid molecules ( compatibly with the available computer power ) , in presence or even in absence of water , and proceed to study how the relevant order parameters behave as functions of temperature and surface density and what are the structural properties of the system in the different regions of its phase diagram .    lacking any realistic theoretical modeling of mesoscopic systems , as membrane or other molecular aggregates of biological relevance",
    ", one must resort to numerical methods , like md or monte carlo and stochastic simulations of various kinds , in order to study the dynamic and thermodynamic behaviour of such complex systems .",
    "md provides us with a microscopic , most often , classical   description of the system , which consists in following its time evolution by solving numerically the newton equations of motion of its elementary constituents .",
    "the general mathematical setting of md for the simulation of diffusive systems is well known  @xcite and we will not dwell on it here . for a general presentation of the method with a discussion of some of the tricks that have been developed to efficiently implement md codes on the existing most powerful parallel platforms in the case of ( @xmath0 ) simulations , we refer the reader to  @xcite .",
    "we have prepared two chemically identical samples of largely different size of our bilayer model , consisting of @xmath1 and @xmath6 molecules , hereafter denoted for short @xmath7 and @xmath8 (  @xmath9 \" and  @xmath10 \" stand for  small \" and  large \" , respectively ) . since",
    ", as we said in the introduction , we do not have explicitly water in our simulations , we will neglect electrostatic interactions altogether . for consistency",
    "we have taken , as a model for the constituent molecules , an artificial variant of dmpc , christened by us dmmg ( _ dimyristoyl - methyl - glycerol _ ) , in which the charged part of the dmpc head ( defined as the part of the molecule above the first atom  a p atom  bound to the glycerol oxygen ) has been replaced by a single ch@xmath11 group .",
    "the detailed chemical structure of the y - shaped dmpc molecule is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schema1 ] , where we have also indicated the modification we have made on its structure in order to construct the artificial variant of it we will be dealing with in this paper . the elementary constituents of the dmmg molecule",
    "will be schematically represented by lj sites centered on the ch@xmath12 groups ( @xmath13 ) , thereby using the so - called  united atom \" approximation . in this way",
    "each dmmg molecule will consist of 37 elementary units ( for short simply  atoms \" in the following ) .",
    "intra - molecular and fully flexible inter - molecular interactions are described by making reference to the opls force field  @xcite with the modifications introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . according to the general opls philosophy ,",
    "we have reduced the strength of the 1 - 4 lj potential in each dihedral angle by a factor 8 .",
    "the inter - molecular potential was linearly switched off between 1.0 and 1.1  nm .",
    "as we already said , no electric charges are attributed to atoms .",
    "we have assumed the crystallographic density of our artificial system , @xmath14 , to be the same as that of dmpc  @xcite .",
    "experimentally the dmpc crystallographic surface density corresponds to an area of 0.396  nm@xmath15 per molecule in the plane of the bilayer ( the @xmath16@xmath17 plane ) .",
    "despite the fact that we have drastically simplified the structure of the head of the constituent molecules , we decided to keep the same number of molecules per unit area as in the case of a dmpc bilayer , in order to be able to compare the properties of our model with those of a somehow related real system . at crystallographic density the surface of the system @xmath7 spans an area of @xmath18  nm@xmath15 , that of the system @xmath8 an area 8 times larger , equal to @xmath19  nm@xmath15 .",
    "the separation of the two layers in the @xmath20 direction is fixed at the beginning of each simulation by setting the distance between the branching points ( the c13 atoms in the picture of fig .",
    "[ fig : schema1 ] ) of two opposite molecules , equal to 4.4  nm .    in order to build the initial bilayer configuration",
    "we have started by generating a molecule with the dihedral angles of molecule a in table 1 of ref  @xcite .",

    "notice that tail  # 1 shows a kink in correspondence to the dihedral angle o14-c17-c19-c20 , making it parallel to tail  # 2 after c19 .",
    "the basic molecule of the lower layer is generated by performing a rigid rotation of the first molecule by @xmath5 around the @xmath17 axis , holding fix the c13 atom .",
    "the two c13 atoms are then displaced by 4.4  nm , by translating one molecule with respect to the other one along the @xmath20 axis .",
    "the fundamental cell of the initial crystal is an orthorhombic prism with the square basis in the @xmath16@xmath17 plane and the longer edge along the @xmath20 axis .",
    "two copies of this pair of molecules have been placed in the cell with the c13 atoms of the lowest molecules located one in a vertex and the other in the center of the @xmath16@xmath17 face , respectively .",
    "finally the fundamental cell is replicated in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 directions the necessary number of times ( _ i.e. _  4@xmath214 and 16@xmath218 times , respectively ) .    as usual , to limit finite - size effects , both @xmath7 and @xmath8 samples are taken to be periodic in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 directions .",
    "for simplicity of computation , periodicity is also imposed in the @xmath20 direction , but adjacent copies of the bilayer are separated by about 100  nm , a distance so large that there are no possible interactions among different copies of the system .",
    "two different md codes , expressly developed by our group , were employed for the simulations of the two systems .",
    "both codes make use of an mts integration algorithm  @xcite with a long time step of 5  fs .",
    "a short time step 10 times smaller is introduced to integrate stretching and bending contributions .",
    "the package used for the @xmath7 system ( @xmath1 molecules ) was run on a digital 500 @xmath22-station .",
    "the code produces 1  ps of simulated dynamics every @xmath23  100  s of cpu - time ( corresponding to 0.5  s of cpu time for every long time - step for a system of 2368 atoms ) . for the larger @xmath8 system ( @xmath2 molecules )",
    "we have employed a parallel version of the previous code .",
    "this code evolved from the one we used in  @xcite to test the level of the performances offered by parallel platforms in md simulations of diffusive systems .",
    "given the large request of computing power necessary to perform simulations of such a big system , use was made of the parallel platform called _ torre _ , the largest ( 512 nodes , 25 giga - flops ) of the today available ape computers  @xcite . on this platform",
    "producing 1  ps of simulated dynamics costs @xmath23  2000  s of cpu - time ( which corresponds to 2  s of cpu time for every long time - step for a system of 18944 atoms ) .    in tables",

    "the high values , @xmath28=25% and @xmath28=50% , that we find for the average percentage population in the torsions ( c12-c13-o14-c17 ) + ( c13-c15-o16-c32 ) and ( o14-c17-c19-c20 ) + ( o16-c32-c34-c35 ) , respectively , are due to the distortion of the geometry in the  kinked \" region close to the ester bond .",
    "these values are essentially the same for all densities and temperatures and are due to the phenomenon of  kink inversion \" between the two tails , described before .",
    "it is worth noticing that the @xmath29=0.83 results are consistent with those obtained for the dppc in the gel phase  @xcite , after correcting for the fact that the dppc hydrophobic tails are 2 methylene groups longer than the dmpc tails .",
    "the smooth increase of the _ gauche _ population along the tails , seen in the simulations performed at the lowest density , means that the rotational freedom of molecule tails does not help in making the tail flexibility in the terminal region larger than that in the core .",
    "this is at variance with the results of the first paper of ref .",
    "@xcite , where a larger mobility of tail end segments , as compared to what is seen in the core region , was found in simulations of the liquid - crystal phase of dppc .",
    "values around 20  % for @xmath28 for the last six torsions of the tails are , in fact , reported .",
    "one might argue that the little tail flexibility we find in our model might be attributed to the much too strong 1 - 4 lj potential we have introduced in each torsion .",
    "these 1 - 4 forces mainly have the effect of adding a steric repulsion in the _ gauche _ conformations .",
    "we recall that within the framework of the opls force - field  @xcite , which we employed in the present paper , we have reduced , according to the general opls philosophy , the strength of the 1 - 4 lj potential by a factor 8 .",
    "this may not have been enough in view of the too high tail rigidity we have found",
    ". however , neglecting 1 - 4 forces altogether gives results only partially in the desired direction .",
    "in fact , on the one hand it actually produces an increase of the _ gauche _ population by a large factor ( in trial simulations performed on liquid butane this factor is found to be about 3 ) , but on the other hand it leads to a more pronounced upward / downward molecular rotational freedom , which may make even more problematic for the system to unveil its liquid - crystal phase .      in fig .",

    "a lowering of the orientational order with the size of the system is actually expected from the observation that in a bigger system fluctuations with longer wave lengths are possible .",
    "further agreement among @xmath8 and @xmath7 simulations emerges from the study of translational order properties .",
    "the @xmath36 distribution functions computed from the @xmath8 simulations show essentially the same structure and locations of the peaks that is seen in the @xmath7 distributions .",

    "we would like to conclude this section with some general considerations about the quest for md simulations of larger and larger systems . given the satisfactory level of consistency we find by comparing the md data of the two samples , one might ask whether simulations of systems as large as @xmath8 are really necessary to get the physics of the system right .",
    "although the answer to this question strongly depends on the kind and the degree of detail of the information one wishes to obtain from the model , it is important to recall that the study of finite volume effects is a necessary step in any numerical simulation , because features and properties seen at small volumes may completely change when the volume is increased . consequently it is absolutely mandatory to get an idea of the magnitude of finite volume corrections .",
    "from our experience it was only thanks to the data we had for the larger system that we could reliably draw useful conclusions on the structural properties of our model - membrane .",
    "apart from these rather general considerations , there are in our opinion many specific problems where the fact of having a sufficiently large system is crucial in order to be in the position of extracting reliable results from numerical simulations .",
    "just to make two examples we may mention :    \\1 ) the problem of trying to accurately locate the critical lines of the phase diagram of the system .",
    "the obvious reason for the necessity of comparing systems of different sizes is that a structural change of the system can be interpreted as a true phase transition only if one is able to show that the transition becomes sharper and sharper as the volume increases .",
    "\\2 ) another very interesting problem is the study of the dynamic and the formation of ion channels . in this case dealing with a sufficiently large system is required by the need of having the cross section of the channel sufficiently smaller than the surface of the bilayer itself in order to meet as accurately as possible the actual physical situation .",
    "we wish to mention in this context the pioneering investigation recently carried out in the beautiful work of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been shown that indeed channels have the possibility of forming and dynamically maintaining themselves stable .",
    "we have performed a systematic md study of the structural properties of a simple atomistic model of bilayer by analyzing the behaviour of a large number of physical quantities characterizing the system , as functions of density and temperature , and by comparing results obtained from simulations carried out on two systems of largely different size .",
    "we have found that our modelization reproduces in a remarkable way many known features of the gel phase of dmpc bilayers  @xcite , as well as the structural changes that accompany the transition from the crystal to the gel phase .",
    "these findings have emerged quite clearly by analyzing the very long trajectories we have collected for the system , @xmath7 , and are nicely confirmed by the statistically equally accurate data we have for the much larger system , @xmath8 .    clearly",
    "a lot of work is still needed to further validate and improve our approach , especially in the direction of investigating the role of water , whose effects were only indirectly accounted for through the modulation of the surface density of the system .",
    "the inability of the model to cope with the expected liquid - crystal phase of the system at low density is its major limitation . to prevent the extrusion of the molecule tails from the planes of the bilayer at low density and high temperature , either some sort of geometric or dynamic constraint must be introduced , perhaps by modifying the intra - molecular tail flexibility , or more directly one should explicitly introduce water .    despite the limitations we have mentioned , from the quality of the results presented in this investigation",
    ", we conclude that the membrane model we have developed is capable of capturing most of the essential structural properties of the real system in the crystal and gel phase .",
    "thanks to its simplicity , we are confident that it will be possible to appropriately improve the model in the directions mentioned above , without affecting the key features that are at the basis of the stability of our bilayer , _",
    "i.e. _  tail packing within the layers and adequately strong interactions between the two layers .",

    "<S> in this paper we present the results of a large - scale numerical investigation of structural properties of a model of cell membrane , simulated as a bilayer of flexible molecules in vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the study was performed by carrying out extensive molecular dynamics simulations , in the ( @xmath0 ) _ micro - canonical ensemble _ , of two systems of different sizes ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 molecules ) , over a fairly large set of temperatures and densities , using parallel platforms and more standard serial computers . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the dimension of the system , the dynamics was followed for physical times that go from few hundred of picoseconds for the largest system to 510 nanoseconds for the smallest one . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the bilayer remains stable even in the absence of water and neglecting coulomb interactions in the whole range of temperatures and densities we have investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the extension of the region of physical parameters that we have explored has allowed us to study significant points in the phase diagram of the bilayer and to expose marked structural changes as density and temperature are varied , which are interpreted as the system passing from a crystal to a gel phase .    </S>",
