    "the inflationary model can explain the observed spatially flat and homogenous universe .",
    "moreover , quantum fluctuations during inflation can give rise to primordial density fluctuations with an almost scale - invariant power spectrum , which is consistent with the recent wmap data on cosmic microwave background anisotropies  @xcite . among various cosmological models ,",
    "the @xmath0cdm model is a quite good one  it can fit cmb data well .",
    "however , the cmb anisotropy measurements made by wmap have shown that the amplitude of the quadrupole is lower than expected for the @xmath0cdm model , although the statistical significance of such an anomaly is not large  @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been many proposed solutions for this anomaly , mostly based on some new ingredients in the generating process of density perturbation  @xcite .",
    "a general assumption of the @xmath0cdm model is that it considers only a vacuum - dominated inflationary epoch , and that it does not consider the possibility of a pre - inflation era .",
    "for example , a radiation - dominated era has taken place before inflation .",
    "in fact , this phase transition has been proposed in the context of spontaneous symmetry breaking to provide with a mechanism for inflation  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will take into account the effect of a pre - inflation radiation - dominated era .",
    "as expected , if inflation lasts very long such that the present universe only occupies a tiny portion of the inflated region , the effect of the phase transition will be negligible .",
    "however , if it happens that the present universe is just comparable to the size of the inflated region , the pre - radiation era may leave imprints on large - scale structures of the universe . here",
    "we will study the effect of the phase transition to the large - scale cmb anisotropy .",
    "recently , this effect has been discussed by powell and kinney  @xcite , who considered large - wavelength inflaton fluctuations in the pre - inflation radiation - dominated era and found a suppression of power on large scales as a result of the choices of vacuum states .",

    "@xcite have found a similar effect caused by a pre - inflation epoch that is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflation . however , the issues about the dynamics of inflaton fluctuations across the phase transition and the proper choices of initial vacuum states have not been fully investigated . here",
    ", we will study these issues in detail .",
    "let us simply consider that the universe has two components during the phase transition ",
    "one is radiation and the other is vacuum energy .",
    "we assume that the pre - inflationary universe is in a radiation - dominated phase and then the universe evolves to a vacuum - energy - dominated or de sitter phase .",
    "although the solution for this transition has been obtained for many years  @xcite , there is no attempt in varying the amounts of radiation and vacuum energies of the universe to see the effect on cmb anisotropy .",
    "this serves a way to test the existence of an unknown pre - inflation phase .",
    "also , it provides a constraint on the period of inflation which needs to be consistent with the observed cmb anisotropy spectrum under such a pre - inflation condition .    in this paper , we use vilenkin and ford s transition solution  @xcite to compute the power spectrum of quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field .",
    "since the pre - inflation phase is radiation - dominated , we use the radiation - dominated solution to determine the boundary conditions .",
    "this allows us to set the form of the seed for the quantum fluctuations before the de sitter phase begins . by introducing this pre - inflation initial condition",
    ", we can calculate the power spectrum of the horizon - crossing modes near the transition region .",
    "then we input the power spectrum to the cmbfast numerical code  @xcite to generate the cmb anisotropy power spectrum .",
    "we vary the amounts of radiation and vacuum energies and tune the duration of inflation to obtain different results . in order to compare the results with the @xmath0cdm model",
    ", we do the chi - square fitting of the generated cmb anisotropy power spectra to the wmap data and calculate the chi - square values .    in next section",
    ", we will derive the mode equation of the quantum fluctuation during the phase transition .",

    "therefore , we have @xmath44 and thus @xmath45 if we take @xmath46 , then @xmath47 .    in the following ,",

    "( [ ps ] ) .",
    "although we have introduced the slow - roll parameter @xmath51 , we will assume a pure de sitter space during inflation and neglect the small slow - roll corrections to the density power spectrum .",
    "this would not affect our interest here since the effect of a pre - inflation radiation - dominated epoch is mainly on large angular scales .",
    "then , we use the resulting density power spectrum and the other cosmological parameters in the wmap best - fit scale - invariant @xmath0cdm model ( i.e. the density power spectrum has a scalar spectral index @xmath52 )  @xcite to generate the cmb anisotropy power spectra .",
    "note that while the observation gives the constraint on @xmath13 , the value of @xmath12 is undetermined .",

    "( [ bc1 ] ) and ( [ bc2 ] ) .",

    "we present the following two cases :    \\(1 ) @xmath48 with @xmath58 . in this case",
    ", the transition takes place at @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "figure  [ fig1](a ) shows the power spectrum of inflaton fluctuations @xmath61 for each set of @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "it is apparent that the large - scale or small-@xmath29 power is suppressed by the presence of the pre - inflation radiation - dominated epoch .",
    "this suppression is similar to that found in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , there are two main differences . for large-@xmath29 modes ,",
    "we have assumed a standard inflationary scale - invariant power spectrum with @xmath52 while they have taken the spectrum with @xmath62 .",
    "for small - k modes , our spectrum increases monotonically with @xmath29 whereas their spectrum undergoes oscillations ; however , both spectra rapidly approach the inflationary spectrum . this oscillatory behavior ,",
    "also found by contaldi _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite ( the result from an analytic computation as shown in fig .  1 of their paper ) and enqvist _ et al .",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite , is actually an artifact resulted from the discontinuity of ricci curvature at the abrupt phase transition .",
    "this artificial particle production can be avoided by considering for example a @xmath63 function for the scale factor @xmath2  @xcite , as we have worked with in eq.([a(t ) ] ) .    besides",
    ", we must be very careful about choosing the initial point @xmath64 while doing the numerical calculation .",
    "for example , in our case with @xmath65 , the phase transition point is at @xmath66 .",
    "we have obtained a smooth power spectrum ( see fig .  [ fig1](a ) ) by choosing the initial @xmath64 to be @xmath67 ( which means that it is in the very early universe ; therefore , it is purely radiation - dominated and also very far from the phase transition point @xmath66 ) .",
    "but , if we tune the initial @xmath64 to be close to the phase transition point , say @xmath68 , the oscillation begins to show up .",
    "and if we tune the initial @xmath64 closer to the phase transition point , for example , @xmath69 , the oscillation becomes larger than that in the @xmath68 case , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "this test explains that if the initial @xmath64 is not in the proper region ( proper region means the radiation - dominated region and that is the right region for the radiation - dominated solution in eq .  ( [ bc1 ] ) , while improper region means the phase transition region which is not a radiation - dominated region and therefore the solution for @xmath70 is not eq .",
    "( [ bc1 ] ) anymore ) .",
    "this improper choice for the initial @xmath64 indeed leads to an oscillating power spectrum .",
    "however , if the initial @xmath64 is carefully chosen in the proper region , it does not lead to an oscillating power spectrum .",
    "note that here we have used the scale factor @xmath71 as the evolution variable .",
    "if we have used the conformal time , we would have obtained an oscillating power spectrum which approaches the flat inflationary spectrum at large @xmath29 .",
    "this explains why the power spectrum obtained by contaldi _",
    "et al . _ in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see fig",
    ".  2 of their paper ) is oscillating although it is obtained from an exact numerical evolution . in their paper , they have indeed used an improper choice of the initial condition which is too close to the phase transition .",
    "( they have chosen an initial kinetic energy of the inflaton only about 100 times of the potential energy . since the kinetic energy of the inflaton decreases as @xmath72",
    ", both energies rapidly become comparable . to obtain a correct power spectrum ,",
    "they should have used a much larger initial kinetic energy . )",
    "the power suppression would affect the cmb anisotropy power spectrum .",
    "for a spectrum @xmath61 , we choose a value of @xmath73 corresponding to the physical scale of @xmath74 and then input this @xmath61 into the cmbfast code to generate the cmb anisotropy power spectrum @xmath75 .",
    "this value of @xmath76 also corresponds to an exponential expansion with the number of e - folds from the start of inflation given by @xmath77 the results are shown in fig .",
    "since the measured low-@xmath78 multipoles of the cmb anisotropy power spectrum are slightly different in the three - year wmap data ( wmap3 )  @xcite from the one - year data ( wmap1 )  @xcite , we compare the chi - square fitting by using wmap3 data with that with wmap1 data .",
    "the results are summarized in tables  [ b1wmap3 ] and [ b1wmap1 ] .",
    "the @xmath79 value of the @xmath0cdm model with a scale - invariant power spectrum using wmap3 data is @xmath80 . from table",
    "[ b1wmap3 ] , we can see that the @xmath79 value for the model decreases to about @xmath81 as @xmath76 increases to @xmath82 , corresponding to @xmath83 e - folds after the start of inflation .",
    "this can be reflected , for example in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , by those five curves for @xmath84 rising in turn from down to top . as we further increase the value of @xmath76 , the resulting @xmath75 approaches to that of the @xmath0cdm model with a scale - invariant power spectrum .",
    "thus , it can be concluded that the wmap3 data does not prefer the presence of a pre - inflation radiation - dominated epoch , although it is not excluded .",
    "if we assume that the comoving scales comparable to our present horizon size cross the hubble radius during inflation when there are @xmath85 e - folds from the end of inflation  @xcite , then the radiation - dominated epoch would take place at least @xmath86 e - folds from the end of inflation .",
    "the case is different when using wmap1 data since the measured one - year low-@xmath78 multipoles are slightly smaller than the three - year results .",
    "the @xmath79 value of the @xmath0cdm model with a scale - invariant power spectrum using wmap1 data is @xmath87 . from table",
    "[ b1wmap1 ] , we can see that the @xmath79 values for all other models are slightly lower than this value at @xmath88 , corresponding to @xmath89 e - folds after the start of inflation .",
    "therefore , the wmap1 data would , albeit a rather low significance , indicate that the universe would be actually predominated by radiation when @xmath90 e - folds from the end of inflation .",
    "\\(2 ) @xmath49 with @xmath58 .",
    "the transition takes place at @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "we do not show the power spectrum of inflaton fluctuations @xmath50 for this case which is indeed quite similar to the previous case .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the @xmath75 power spectra and their @xmath79 values are given in tables  [ b0.1wmap3 ] and [ b0.1wmap1 ] .",
    "in table  [ b0.1wmap3 ] , the @xmath79 value decreases rapidly to about @xmath93 at @xmath94 ; however , at large @xmath76 all models approach to the @xmath0cdm model with a scale - invariant power spectrum . in table",
    "[ b0.1wmap1 ] , the @xmath79 values for all the models reach a minimum at @xmath95 , which is lower than the @xmath79 value for the @xmath0cdm model with a scale - invariant power spectrum .",
    "this corresponds to an inflationary expansion with e - folds of @xmath96 after the start of inflation . because the @xmath79 values decrease with @xmath76 in the @xmath49 case faster than the @xmath48 case , the anisotropy power spectra are closer to each other and the @xmath49 case reaches the standard @xmath0cdm model at a smaller @xmath76 value .",
    "it means that inflation in the @xmath48 case lasts longer than the @xmath49 case in order to be consistent with the cmb anisotropy power spectrum observed today .",
    "we have assumed that inflation is driven by a nearly flat potential and thus neglected any spectral index . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] there is a certain degeneracy in the cmb power spectrum between the variation of the spectral index and the existence of a pre - inflation radiation - dominated era , so a joint likelihood fitting of relevant cosmological parameters to wmap data should be carried out before drawing any conclusion about pre - inflation physics .",
    "we have shown that the existence of a pre - inflation radiation - dominated phase can affect the cmb anisotropy power spectrum . this transition can give a low quadrupole value by adjusting the values for @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath76 .",
    "the smaller is the value of @xmath76 , the closer is the comoving scales of the present universe to the transition when they cross out the horizon during inflation .",
    "this manifests as rising up or down for those low-@xmath78 @xmath75 of the @xmath97 spectra in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "meanwhile , the high-@xmath78 @xmath75 , for example , in fig .  [ fig2]d is significantly lower than the observed values .",
    "so , it is unlikely that the inflationary era lasts for only @xmath98 e - folds .",
    "as expected , the effect of the radiation phase becomes weaker as the value of @xmath76 increases .",
    "from the three - year wmap data , using the wmap best - fit @xmath0cdm model parameters , we have found that the phase transition occurs at least @xmath99 e - folds from the end of inflation .",
    "interestingly , the one - year wmap data indeed prefers very slightly the pre - inflation radiation - dominated phase taking place as early as about @xmath99 e - folds from the end of inflation .",
    "future cmb observations will provide more severe constraints on this transitional effect , and a joint likelihood fitting to cmb data for studying the degeneracy between the addition of a pre - inflation radiation - dominated era and other relevant cosmological parameters will certainly be necessary .",
