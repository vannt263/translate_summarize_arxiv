    "the standard model ( sm ) has been very successful in predicting and fitting all the experimental measurements up - to - date over energies ranging many orders of magnitude@xcite .",
    "unfortunately the sm is only a patchwork where several sectors remain totally unconnected .",
    "flavor physics for example involves quark masses , mixings angles and cp violating phases appearing in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quarks mixing matrix@xcite .",
    "these parameters unavoidably have to be measured and are independent from parameters present in other sectors like electroweak symmetry breaking , quantum chromodynamics , etc .",
    "other sectors remain to be tested like cp violation in the up - quarks sector and even tensions with experimental measurements remain to be cleared ( see for instance refs.@xcite ) .",
    "this is why it is important to find processes where the sm predictions are very well known and a simple measurement can show their discrepancy .",
    "one of these processes is the rare decays and other null tests which correspond to an observable strictly equal to zero within sm .",
    "so any deviation from zero of these null tests observables is a clear signal of physics beyond sm .",
    "this is the case of cabibbo - favored ( cf ) and double cabibbo suppressed ( dcs ) non - leptonic charm decays where the direct cp violation is very suppressed given that penguin diagrams are absent@xcite .",
    "even with the observation of @xmath0 oscillation @xcite and the first signal of cp violation in @xmath3 ( singly cabibbo suppressed ( scd ) modes ) @xcite , it is not clear that the sm @xcite can describe correctly the cp violation in the up quarks sector .",
    "it is even more difficult as large distance contributions are important and difficult to be evaluated @xcite . from the point of view of new physics ( np ) , cp violation in cf and dcs modes is an excellent opportunity given that it is very suppressed in the sm and it is not easy to find a np model able to produce a reasonable cp violation signal . thus measuring cp violation in these channels",

    "the theoretical estimations of these parameters@xcite are not easy as they have large uncertainties given that the @xmath10 quark is not heavy enough to apply heavy quark effective theory ( hqe ) ( like in @xmath11 physics)@xcite .",
    "similarly it is not light enough to use chiral perturbation theory ( cpth ) ( like in kaon physics ) . besides there are cancellations due to the gim mechanism@xcite .",
    "theoretically cp violation in the charm sector is smaller than in the @xmath11 and kaon sectors .",
    "this is due to a combination factors : ckm matrix elements ( @xmath12 ) and the fact that @xmath13 quark mass is small compared to top mass .",
    "cp violation in the @xmath13-quark sector is due to the large top quark mass , while in the kaon is due to a combination of the charm and top quark .",

    "the recent lhc results which observe an excess in the @xmath92 corresponding to a higgs mass around 125 @xmath93 @xcite seems to exclude the sm4 scenario @xcite but this results is based on the fact that once we include the next - to leading order electroweak corrections , the rate @xmath94 is suppressed by more than 50% compared to the rate including only the leading order corrections @xcite .",
    "this could be a signal of a non - perturbative regime which in sm4 can be easily reached at this scale due to the fourth generation strong yukawa couplings .",
    "therefore , direct and model - independent searches for fourth generation families at collider physics are still necessary to completely exclude the sm4 scenario .",
    "the cp asymmetry in model with a fourth family is easy to compute as the contributions come from the same diagrams in the sm with just adding an extra @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "similarly in ref.@xcite , it has been found that new ckm matrix elements can be obtained ( all consistent with zero and for @xmath97 gev ) to be @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) are unbounded .",
    "thus the absolute values of the ckm elements for the three families remain almost unchanged but not their phases . from these values",
    "one obtains @xmath100 for a 4th sequential family the maxima value for the cp violation is obtained as @xmath101 where one uses @xmath102    this maximal value is obtained when the parameters mentioned above are varied in a the range allowed by the experiential constrains , according to eq .",

    "@xcite ) and their parameters have been strongly constrained by experiments @xcite . recently , cms @xcite and atlas @xcite at lhc have improved the bound on the scale of the @xmath107 gauge boson mass @xcite .",
    "the new diagrams contributing to @xmath108 are similar to the sm tree - level diagrams with @xmath109 is replaced by a @xmath107 .",
    "these diagrams contribute to the effective hamiltonian in the following way assuming no mixing between @xmath110 and @xmath107 gauge bosons :    @xmath111    where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the gauge @xmath114 and @xmath115 couplings respectively . @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the @xmath114 and @xmath115 charged gauge boson masses respectively .",
    "@xmath118 is the quark mixing matrix which appears in the right sector of the lagrangian similar to the ckm quark mixing matrix .",
    "this new contribution can enhance the sm prediction for the cp asymmetry but still it is suppressed due to the limit on @xmath119 which has to be of order @xmath120 tev @xcite in case of no - mixing left right models .    in refs.@xcite it has been shown that the mixing between the left and the right gauge bosons can strongly enhance any cp violation in the charm and muon sector .",
    "this lr mixing is restricted by deviation to non - unitarity of the ckm quark mixing matrix .",
    "the results were that the left - right ( lr ) mixing angle called @xmath121 has to be smaller than 0.005@xcite and right scale @xmath122 bigger than 2.5 tev@xcite .",
    "if the left - right is not manifest ( essentially that @xmath123 could be different from @xmath124 at unification scale ) , the limit on @xmath122 scale is much less restrictive and the right gauge bosons could be as light as @xmath125 tev @xcite .",
    "in such a case , @xmath121 can be as large as @xmath126 if large cp violation phases in the right sector are present @xcite still compatible with experimental data @xcite .",
    "recently , precision measurement of the muon decay parameters done by twist collaboration @xcite put model independent limit on @xmath121 to be smaller than 0.03 ( taking @xmath127 ) .",
    "let s now compute the effect of the lr mixing gauge boson on our cp asymmetry .",

    "the asymmetry can be as large as 0.1 .",
    "also , we should notice that to obtain this results , it has been used the fact that the chiralities do nt mix under strong interactions , if the quark masses are not taken into account .",
    "this is approximately the case in the evolution of the wilson coefficients from @xmath116 to @xmath53 as the quark in the loop are the down quarks contrarily to process like @xmath143 where the quarks in the qcd corrections are the up quarks and in that case , a strong effect from top quarks could be expected @xcite . in our case , as a first approximation , the qcd corrections to the wilson coefficient coming from the running of the renormalization group from @xmath116 to @xmath53 can be safely neglected .",
    "our last example of new physics is considering contribution to the effective hamiltonian responsible of the @xmath18 process due to a new charged higgs fields .",
    "the simple sm extensions which include new charged higgs fields are the two higgs doublet models ( 2hdm)@xcite . usually , it is used to classify these 2hdm in three types : type i , ii or iii ( for a review see ref .",

    "of course , this means that 2hdm type iii can induce flavor violation in neutral current and thus it can be used to strongly constrain the new parameters in the model .",

    "this in contrast to the constraints derived by applying the naturalness criterion where we showed that the constraints become loose with the increasing of the value of @xmath176 .      the total amplitude including sm and charged higgs contribution can be written as = ( c^sm_1 + c^sm_2 + ^^+(c^h_1-c^h_4))x_d^0k^-^^+- ( c^sm_2 + 1n c^sm_1 + ( c^h_1-^d^0 c^h_4))x_k^-^+^d^0[higst]with @xmath261 , @xmath262 and @xmath140 and @xmath141 are previously defined as ^^+&=&m_^2(m_c - m_s)(m_u+m_d ) + ^d^0&= & m_d^2(m_c+m_u)(m_s - m_d)the form of the amplitude , @xmath263 , shows how charged higgs contribution can affect only the short physics ( wilson coefficients ) without any new effect on the long range physics ( hadronic parameters ) .",

    "in this paper , we have studied the cabibbo favored non - leptonic @xmath0 decays into @xmath1 .",
    "we have shown that the standard model prediction for the corresponding cp asymmetry is strongly suppressed and out of experimental range even taking into account the large strong phases coming from the final state interactions .",
    "then we explored new physics models taking into account three possible extensions namely , extra family , extra gauge bosons within left - right grand unification models and extra higgs fields .",
    "the fourth family model strongly improved sm prediction of the cp asymmetry but still the predicted cp asymmetry is far of the reach of lhcb or superb factory as superkekb .",
    "the most promising models are no - manifest left - right extension of the sm where the lr mixing between the gauge bosons permits us to get a strong enhancement in the cp asymmetry . in such a model",

    "<S> we show also that although new physics models with extra sequential generation can enhance the cp asymmetry by few orders of magnitude however the resulting cp asymmetry is still far from experimental range . </S>",
    "<S> the most sensitive new physics models to this cp asymmetry comes from no - manifest left - right models where a cp asymmetry up to 10% can be reached and general two higgs models extension of sm where a cp asymmetry of order @xmath2 can be obtained without being in contradiction with the experimental constraints on these models . </S>"
