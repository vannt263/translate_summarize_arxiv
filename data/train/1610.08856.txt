    "massive stars play important roles in a wide range of astrophysical settings .",
    "they are the sources of uv radiation , turbulent energy and heavy elements .",
    "massive star close binaries are the likely progenitors of merging black hole systems that have been the first sources to be detected by their gravitational wave emission .",
    "however , massive star formation is relatively poorly understood compared to low - mass star formation ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "one class of models of massive star formation is based on the core accretion scenario ( e.g. , the turbulent core model of * ? ? ?",
    "these models are scaled - up versions of models of low - mass star formation from cores ( e.g. , shu , adams & lizano 1987 ) , invoking nonthermal forms of pressure support , i.e. , turbulence and magnetic fields to help stabilize the initial massive pre - stellar core",
    ". however , there may also be significant differences compared to low - mass star formation due to the stronger feedback that is expected from massive protostars .    in low - mass star formation , the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) outflow",
    "is thought to be the main feedback process , which may determine the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) from the pre - stellar core , i.e. , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the final mass that is achieved by the protostar at the end of its accretion and @xmath10 is the mass of the initial core . in",
    "relatively low - mass clusters that contain stars with masses up to @xmath19 , the core mass function ( cmf ) is reported to be similar in shape to the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , but shifted to higher masses by a factor of a few ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one explanation for this is a nearly constant sfe as a function of core mass of about @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite proposed that the accretion - powered , mhd - driven outflow sets the sfe from pre - stellar cores .",
    "they provided an analytic model and showed that the momentum injected by the disk wind sweeps up a certain fraction of material in the infalling envelope and sets a sfe of @xmath0@xmath1 .",
    "the numerical simulation by @xcite confirmed this result obtaining a similar value of sfe .",
    "therefore , in low - mass star formation , observations and theoretical models are in agreement that an individual star can be formed by collapse of a pre - stellar core with the mhd outflow setting a sfe of @xmath21 .    in massive star formation , additional feedback processes may become more significant than the mhd outflow because of the high luminosities of massive stars .",
    "especially , radiation pressure has been considered to be a potential barrier for massive star formation . in an idealized spherical geometry ,",
    "radiation pressure acting on dust grains in an infalling envelope exceeds the gravitational force when the stellar mass reaches @xmath22@xmath23 preventing further mass accretion @xcite .",
    "the fact that more massive stars exist tells us that the model of spherical infall is too simplified .",
    "subsequent work on analytic and semi - analytic models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of disk accretion found that mass infall and accretion can continue from behind the disk since this region is shielded from strong radiation pressure .",
    "the series of simulations by kuiper and collaborators have shown that disk accretion continues while the direct stellar radiation sweeps up the material above the disk where the shielding effect is weak @xcite .",
    "they found the sfe from @xmath24-cores is about @xmath1 in models without mhd disk wind feedback .",
    "the recent simulation with high resolution and moving sink particle method by @xcite showed that the rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability strongly helps to bypass the radiation pressure barrier even above the disk .",
    "also , if mhd outflow cavities exist before radiation pressure becomes significant , then radiation leaks away via these channels , i.e. , enhancing the so - called `` flashlight effect '' @xcite .",
    "thus , the radiation pressure barrier is not thought to be a catastrophic problem anymore for massive star formation .",
    "rather the question now is what is its quantitative effect on the formation efficiency of massive stars from massive cores .",
    "photoionization may also be a significant feedback process .",
    "when a massive protostar approaches the zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) , it contracts , increases its effective temperature and starts to emits significant fluxes of lyman continnum photons with @xmath25 that may ionize the infalling / accreting material .",
    "such ionized gas has a high temperature of @xmath26 and its thermal pressure may drive mass - loss in a `` photoevaporative '' outflow . in the formation of primordial ( pop iii ) stars in the early universe , photoevaporation is thought to be significant , potentially stopping mass accretion at @xmath27@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "note that radiation pressure feedback is not very significant in primordial star formation since there are no dust grains .",
    "coincidentally , the typical mass accretion rates in primordial star formation and in present - day massive star formation are expected to be similar , with values of @xmath28 .",
    "thus , one may speculate that photoevaporation also stops mass accretion in present - day massive star formation .",
    "however , the dependence of the photoevaporation rate on metallicity has not been studied very much and remains uncertain .",
    "the simulation of present - day massive star formation by @xcite suggested that photoionization feedback is not very significant , but a general theoretical framework of photoevaporation spanning the whole metallicity range from primordial to quasi - solar metallicities remains lacking .",
    "feedback by protostellar outflows , radiation pressure and photoevaporation act on the infalling / accreting material .",
    "stellar winds launched from the protostellar surface could in principle also act against the accretion flow , but , as we will discuss below , they are expected to always be confined by the protostellar outflow and thus not have a direct impact on the accretion .",
    "however , mass - loss directly from these stellar winds could potentially become significant , especially for protostars at the highest masses and luminosities .",
    "the mass - loss by a stellar wind is certainly important during the later evolution of massive stars .",
    "for example , in the case of the r136a1 wolf - rayet ( wr ) star with current mass of @xmath29 , a stellar wind mass - loss rate of @xmath30 is inferred , and its initial mass is evaluated to have been as high as @xmath31 @xcite . the theoretical calculation by @xcite has found that the stellar wind mass - loss rate becomes extremely high if the eddington factor to electron scattering is higher than @xmath32 .",
    "they interpreted this high mass - loss regime as leading to the observational appearance as wr stars and the lower mass - loss regime as o - type stars .",
    "however , the protostellar internal luminosity as a function of mass , and thus the eddington factor , depends on the accretion history .",
    "thus it is possible that in some circumstances the eddington factor might potentially reach the extreme mass - loss regime even during the protostellar stage .",
    "the feedback and mass - loss processes described above may impact the ability of very massive stars to form and thus reveal themselves in the observed distribution of the imf , e.g. , perhaps creating a break or turnover in the @xcite power law that holds from lower masses @xmath33 to at least @xmath34 .",
    "in other words , feedback and mass - loss may imply there is a maximum stellar mass that can form .",
    "observationally , @xcite have reported the absence of stars with masses @xmath35 in the arches cluster near the galactic center , whereas extension of the salpeter mass function predicts there should be 18 of them .",
    "thus figer concluded there is an upper stellar mass limit of @xmath36 .",
    "later studies of the tarantula nebula in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , stars with initial masses of @xmath37@xmath38 were found @xcite .",
    "since lmc has lower metallicity ( by about a factor of two ) than the galaxy , it can be speculated that the impact of feedback and/or mass - loss depends on the metallicity , which then affects the upper imf in different environments .    a trend to a higher maximum stellar mass with decreasing metallicity is potentially supported by the theoretical studies of @xcite , who found that pop iii stars may reach masses as high as @xmath39 .",
    "unfortunately there are no direct observational constraints on the masses of pop iii stars .",
    "however , the chemical abundance patterns of galactic metal - poor stars , which may be second generation stars polluted by pop iii supernova ejecta , have been interpreted as indicating that there were such very massive primordial stars @xcite .",
    "such conclusions , however , remain very tentative .",
    "overall , a good theoretical understanding of how the stellar imf depends on metallicity remains lacking .",
    "although there have been many studies concentrating on each radiative feedback mechanism in massive star formation , there has not yet been a study that has considered all the main processes together , including with the effects of an mhd - launched outflow . in this paper",
    ", we aim to carry out such a study with the goal of evaluating the sfe of pre - stellar cores of different masses and in different environments . a full numerical simulation with mhd and radiative effects that resolves the protostellar surface and the outer core scale and follows the full evolutionary growth of the protostar is computationally challenging and beyond current state - of - the - art capabilities .",
    "here we present a semi - analytic model of this process that includes all the expected important physical processes and yet at the same time can be applied to large range of different conditions .",
    "this allows us to gain physical insight into the problem and can help guide future numerical simulation experiments .",
    "our modeling builds upon our previous work that developed semi - analytic models for massive star formation @xcite , but which did not yet include treatment of radiative feedback or stellar wind mass - loss .",
    "additionally , we apply the same model to primordial star formation at zero metallicity , to gain insight into the metallicity dependence of massive star formation feedback .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec_method ]",
    "we review the basics of our model , and introduce the updates to include the effects of feedback processes .",
    "next , in ",
    "[ sec_results ] , we present our results : we show how the accretion rate and sfe are reduced by multiple feedback processes , and also reveal the differences caused by solar and zero metallicities . in  [ sec_discussion ]",
    ", we discuss the relative importance of different feedback mechanisms , their impact on shaping the high - mass end of the imf , and their dependence on metallicity .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec_conclusion ] .",
    "we calculate the accretion history of massive star formation including multiple feedback processes .",
    "the framework of our model has been constructed in a series of papers : @xcite , and @xcite . in these works ,",
    "massive protostellar evolution with mhd disk wind feedback is calculated .",
    "we then estimate continuum emission from the protostar and disk , which is then followed in radiative transfer calculations , especially to predict infrared , sub - millimeter and cm - radio morphologies and spectral energy distributions .",
    "now we extend this massive protostellar evolution model to include feedback by radiation pressure and photoevaporation , and stellar wind mass - loss .",
    "we note that this follows a similar methodology to that of @xcite , who considered the formation of primordial stars under the influence of multiple feedback processes .",
    "we review the basics of our model that were developed in previous works @xcite in  [ sec_method_rev ] , introduce the methods for each feedback process in  [ sec_method_fb ] , and explain how they are combined together in  [ sec_acc_rate ] .",
    "figure [ fig_schematic ] shows the schematic view of our model . although the main target of this study is present - day massive star formation , we also apply our model to primordial star formation for comparison of this different environment and for comparison with the previous results of mckee & tan ( 2008 ) .",
    "thus in  [ sec_popiii_model ] , we describe the modifications of methods that are used to apply the model to primordial star formation .    , mass surface density of the ambient clump @xmath40 , and the ratio of core initial rotational to gravitational energy @xmath41 .",
    "the model includes momentum feedback from a mhd disk wind and radiation pressure .",
    "it also follows mass - loss resulting from the mhd disk wind , photoevaporation and the stellar wind.,width=321 ]      our model assumes a pre - stellar core collapses to form one massive star .",
    "this model should be a reasonable approximation even for multiple systems in which there is a single dominant protostar .",
    "the initial core is assumed to be spherical and close to virial equilibrium by the support of turbulence and/or magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the parameters to determine core properties are core mass @xmath10 , mass surface density of the ambient clump @xmath40 , and the core s initial rotational to gravitational energy ratio @xmath42 .",
    "the core is assumed to be in pressure equilibrium with the ambient clump .",
    "if the clump is self - gravitating then this ambient pressure is related to its surface density @xmath40 , which sets the pressure at the core surface , thus determining its size .",
    "the core radial density profile is assumed to be a power law , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "observations of dense cores in infrared dark clouds find @xmath44@xmath45 @xcite , and we adopt @xmath46 as a fiducial value , which is the same as the fiducial value used by @xcite ( also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "then , the radius of a core is given as @xmath47 .",
    "the core radius is smaller for higher-@xmath40 since the core is in pressure equilibrium with the ambient clump .",
    "the rotational parameter is fixed as @xmath48 , i.e. , similar to values derived from observations of lower - mass cores @xcite . in this study",
    ", we investigate the collapse of cores with @xmath49@xmath50 at @xmath51@xmath52 , @xmath53@xmath5 at @xmath54 , and @xmath53@xmath38 at @xmath55 .",
    "the inside - out collapse of a core that is a singular polytropic sphere is described by the self - similar solution @xcite , which gives the infall rate onto the central protostar - disk system in the limit of no feedback : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the collapsed mass , which indicates the mass of the protostar and disk if there was no feedback at all .",
    "a higher clump mass surface density leads to a more compact core and thus a shorter free - fall time and higher infall rate .",
    "also , this formula indicates that the infall rate increases with time in the no - feedback case ( set by the choice of @xmath58 ; a choice of @xmath59 would lead to a constant infall rate ) . to obtain the actual mass accretion rate ,",
    "we need to calculate the effect of feedback processes , which will be described in  [ sec_method_fb ] .",
    "we note that , in all models in this study , the accretion rates are always smaller than the eddington rate of @xmath60 .",
    "since the initial core is rotating , a disk is assumed to form around the protostar .",
    "for simplicity , we only include the effect of rotation inside the sonic point where the infall becomes supersonic and assume that the ratio of the rotational to gravitational energy is constant at this location , @xmath61 .",
    "based on the angular momentum conservation from the sonic point , the disk radius is given by @xmath62 ( see  2.1 of * ? ? ?",
    "the protostellar disk is expected to be massive and self - gravitating due to high mass supply from the infalling envelope .",
    "the angular momentum is transported efficiently by torques in such a massive disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , keeping the mass ratio of disk and protostar approximately constant at @xmath63 ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "we note that these density structures of rotating infall and protostellar disks were developed by @xcite and were then used in radiative transfer calculations for synthetic observations . however , in this study , we only focus on the accretion history of forming massive stars , and thus do not need the detailed structure of the envelopes and disks , except for the opening angle of the outflow cavity .",
    "thus we do not expect the results to be very sensitive to the choice of @xmath42 as long as @xmath64 so that the outer core structure is quasi spherical .    the properties of the protstar , such as luminosity , radius , effective temperature , and their evolution are important to evaluate the strength of feedback . in our study ,",
    "the protostellar evolution is calculated self - consistently , being adapted to the accretion rate using the model of @xcite and @xcite ( which is based on the method developed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the typical mass - accretion rate in massive star formation is higher than that in low - mass star formation , the rate of entropy carried into the star is also high .",
    "this leads to a large protostellar radius of @xmath65 before kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) contraction starts to be effective @xcite .",
    "this swelling causes lower effective temperatures and lower ionizing photon rates than those predicted by the zams model at the same mass .",
    "the evolution also depends on the geometry of the accretion flow , i.e. , spherical or disk accretion .",
    "the accretion geometry is quasi - spherical when the expected disk radius @xmath66 is smaller than the stellar radius @xmath67 . in this case , a shock front is produced when this flow hits the stellar surface and a fraction of the released gravitational energy is advected into the stellar interior , which is referred as the `` hot '' shock boundary .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath68 , the material accretes onto the stellar surface through a geometrically thin - disk . in disk accretion ,",
    "much of the energy radiates away before the material settles onto the star . in the limiting case",
    "the entropy carried into star can be assumed to be the same as the gas in the stellar photosphere , which is referred as the `` cold '' photospheric boundary condition . in our model ,",
    "the calculation starts from the hot shock boundary and switches to the cold photospheric boundary at @xmath69 .",
    "when the accreting material reaches the stellar surface , the accretion energy of @xmath70 ( in the case of disk accretion ) is released , where @xmath71 is the accretion rate onto the star . following previous works",
    ", we treat this accretion luminosity and the intrinsic internal stellar luminosity as radiating isotropically with a single effective temperature : @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt the stellar atmospheric model `` atlas '' @xcite to obtain the stellar spectrum @xmath74 .",
    "then the ionizing photon rate is evaluated as @xmath75 . due to line absorption",
    ", the ionizing photon rate can be smaller by orders of magnitude than that simply evaluated by integrating over a blackbody spectrum , especially when @xmath76 .",
    "the accretion rate onto the star is smaller than the collapse rate given by equation ( [ eq_mdot ] ) because of feedback .",
    "it is necessary to estimate the impact of feedback to obtain the final mass and the sfe .",
    "here we explain how we evaluate the feedback processes and their effect on the accretion rate .",
    "the bipolar outflow sweeps up part of the core and thus helps to set the sfe .",

    "@xcite included mhd disk wind feedback using the model of @xcite . in this model ,",
    "if the outflow momentum is strong enough to accelerate the core material to its escape speed , the outflow extends in that direction .",
    "we simply extended this model including the additional term of the radiation pressure : the following equation is satisfied at the polar angle of @xmath80 @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the solid angle , @xmath83 is the escape velocity from the core , and @xmath84 is a correction factor to account for the effects of gravity on the propagation of the shocked shell .",

    "based on appendix of @xcite , we estimate @xmath86 for our core set up .    the total mhd disk wind momentum @xmath87 is evaluated by integrating the momentum rate of the wind using a semi - analytic disk wind solution that is modified from the centrifugally driven mhd outflow model of @xcite : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the keplerian speed at the stellar radius",

    "the momentum by the mhd disk wind ( and radiation pressure ) sweeps up much large amount of gas from the envelope creating the outflow cavity . as we will see in ",
    "[ sec_results ] , this outflow driven by the disk wind is the most significant feedback .    in low - mass star formation , the mhd disk wind is the dominant source of momentum feedback .",
    "radiation pressure becomes significant if the stellar mass reaches @xmath108 .",
    "the momentum from radiation pressure @xmath79 is obtained by the integral of the radiation pressure momentum injection rate which is given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a trapping factor accounting for the increment of direct radiation pressure force by dust re - emission @xcite .",
    "this radiation by dust re - emission should be reduced significantly by the pre - existing mhd outflow cavity @xcite and/or the rt instability @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the implementation of our model in this paper the effect of dust re - emission is ignored and only direct stellar radiation is considered , i.e. , @xmath111 .",

    "below , we will compare the mass - loss from the system by this mechanism with that due to other feedback processes .",
    "we also include effect of shielding by the inner disk .",
    "since this inner disk shielding is efficient to overcome the direct stellar radiation pressure , infall can always continue from the disk shadow region @xcite .",

    "the mass - loss rate dramatically increases with @xmath155 and they called this upturn at @xmath156 as the `` kink . ''",
    "we adopt a stellar wind mass - loss rate as a function of stellar mass @xmath157 and luminosity @xmath158 based on the fiducial results of @xcite : @xmath159 this mass - loss rate is evaluated based on a fixed effective temperature of @xmath160 . @xcite",
    "have suggested that the mass - loss rate would jump up about one order of magnitude if the effective temperature is lower than @xmath161 .",
    "however , our protostellar evolution calculation shows that the effective temperature is always higher than @xmath162 when the eddington factor is higher than @xmath163 .",
    "also the variation of mass - loss rate with effective temperature is less than a factor of a few in this high temperature range .",
    "thus , the stellar wind mass - loss rate given by equation ( [ eq_mdot_sw ] ) is a reasonable approximation for our model , even ignoring the @xmath164 dependence .",
    "indeed , we will show that the stellar wind mass - loss has only a minor effect compared to other feedback processes .",
    "we have introduced estimations of the impact of multiple feedback processes .",

[ fig_schematic ] ) .",
    "note that , due to the stellar wind mass - loss , the net accretion rate , or the stellar - mass growth rate , is smaller than the accretion rate onto the star , @xmath170 following our previous study , the mass ratio of disk and star is assumed to be constant at @xmath171 by the self - gravitational - torque regulation ( e.g , * ? ? ?",

    "feedback by radiation pressure does not appear explicitly in equation ( [ eq_mdot_tot ] ) , however , it increases the opening angle @xmath77 and escape fraction @xmath103 .",
    "we continue the protostellar evolution calculation as long as @xmath176 , i.e. , the stellar mass increases , and determine the stellar mass at the moment of @xmath177 as the final mass when it forms @xmath178 .",
    "note that , since the outflow opening angle has a limit set by the disk shielding effect , the outflow from the mhd disk wind and radiation pressure can not stop mass accretion completely , i.e. , @xmath179 .",
    "therefore , the accretion finishes when ( 1 ) mass - loss by photoevaporation and stellar wind is significant , or ( 2 ) the entire core collapses , i.e. , @xmath180 .",

    "the instantaneous sfe is important since it is in principle observable for individual protostellar systems .",
    "for example , @xcite measured the detailed structure of the hh46/47 molecular outflow using atacama large millimeter / sub - millimeter array ( alma ) , and reported the instantaneous sfe to be @xmath182@xmath183 . however here",

    "note that the disk mass is so far ignored in the evaluation of the final stellar mass .",
    "however , some amount of disk accretion would still be able to continue even after the entire core collapses .",
    "the accretion rate is expected to decline as the disk mass to stellar mass ratio drops and self - gravitational torques become less effective .",
    "we expect that such a lower accretion rate disk would be more readily dissipated by photoevaporation and/or radiation pressure . however , the fraction of the disk mass that finally accretes onto the star is uncertain because the actual angular momentum transport processes are uncertain at this stage .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , we ignore the disk mass in the sfe evaluation , and note that the actual sfe may be underestimated by up to a factor of @xmath184 .      although the main purpose of this paper is the study of feedback in massive star formation in present - day universe , we also apply the same feedback model to primordial star formation in the early universe for comparison and demonstration of our model . here",

    "the main difference of protostellar evolution is that stellar radius in the main - sequence phase is smaller at zero metallicity than that at solar metallicity .",

    "it is clearly seen that the outflow sweeping rate is orders of magnitude higher than other mass - loss rates in figure  [ fig_hist]d , which indicates the mhd outflow , assisted by radiation pressure , is the most dominant feedback process .",

    "this simple fitting formula is convenient analytic result that can be applied as a sub - grid model to large scale simulations of star formation that resolve formation of massive pre - stellar cores ( note , this result applies to cores from @xmath288 to @xmath289 ) .",

    "next we consider the metallicity dependence of massive star formation in  [ sec_metal ] .",
    "finally , we note the caveats and limitations of our modeling in  [ sec_cav ] .      we have studied multiple feedback mechanisms , i.e. , mhd disk wind , radiation pressure , photoevaporation , and stellar wind , during star formation via core accretion .",

    "infall stops formation of massive star formation for @xmath290 .",
    "however , in non - spherical disk accretion , the optically thick inner region shields outer equatorial zone accretion . additionally , the mhd disk wind outflow cavity effectively reduces the effects of radiation pressure by dust re - emission , i.e. , @xmath291 . using equations ( [ eq_pdw ] ) and ( [ eq_prad ] )",
    ", we can compare the momentum injection rates from the mhd disk wind and from radiation pressure : @xmath292 here we use the luminosity and radius of the zams model @xcite and adopt @xmath293 from our results ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "as seen from this evaluation , the mhd disk wind momentum injection rate is much higher than that from radiation pressure even for @xmath294 .",
    "however , as described in ",
    "[ sec_outflow ] , the mhd disk wind is collimated while the stellar radiation acts isotropically . considering the angular distribution of momenta ( eq . [ eq_phidw ] ) , we obtain the following relation , @xmath295 it can be seen that the component of radiation pressure is not negligible at large angles @xmath296 away from the outflow axis .",
    "also , these equations indicate that the contribution of radiation pressure is higher at lower accretion rates , i.e. , lower @xmath40 cases .",
    "the accretion rate also becomes smaller when the outflow cavity opens up , which enhances the importance of @xmath79 . in this way",
    ", the mhd disk wind supplies a large measure of momentum to create the outflow , and the radiation pressure assists to open up the cavity and help set the sfe .    as shown in  [ sec_pe ] , the photoevaporation mass - loss rate is regulated by dust attenuation of ionizing photons and is a relatively minor feedback process , unlike in the case of primordial star formation .",
    "of course , dust attenuation only occurs in the region where dust survives , i.e. , @xmath297 . for this region",
    ", assuming a constant recombination rate @xmath141 , we can derive a simple differential equation from equations ( [ eq_n0_d ] ) and ( [ eq_taud ] ) : @xmath298 where @xmath299 is the base density of the photoevaporation flow at the dust sublimation front , and @xmath300 is a dimensionless radius .",
    "this equation has an analytic solution of @xmath301 the characteristic optical depth of the system @xmath247 , which also appears in  [ sec_pe ] , is evaluated as @xmath302 from equation ( [ eq_n0_df ] ) and assuming an ionized gas temperature of @xmath303 .",
    "this solution is consistent with the dust - free case in the limit of @xmath304 .",
    "considering limits of a far distance of @xmath305 , we see basic features of the effects of dust attenuation , i.e. , @xmath306 and @xmath307 .",
    "the photoevaporation flow reaches optically thick conditions , i.e. , @xmath308 , when the characteristic optical depth reaches @xmath309 .",
    "however , in the optically thick limit of @xmath254 , the total optical depth converges to @xmath310 , which is smaller than @xmath247 .",
    "thus , the suppression of base density @xmath311 is not as strong as the exponent of @xmath312 and involves only a factor of @xmath247 . due to this suppression of photoionization , the total evaporation rate",
    "is also regulated to @xmath313 since the evaporation rate is proportional to @xmath311 ( eq . [ eq_mdot_pe ] ) . in this manner ,",
    "dust attenuation of ionizing photons regulates the mass - loss rate by photoevaporation when @xmath314 .",
    "the stellar wind is found to be the weakest feedback process in our model .",
    "please note that we have not explicitly considered the momentum injection from the wind , since it is always sub - dominant compared to the mhd disk wind and radiation pressure and would be confined along a narrow region of the outflow axis .",
    "the eddington factor @xmath155 evaluated by our protostellar calculation is typically higher than that of the zams case , however it is still smaller than the critical value of @xmath32 to initiate the extreme wind mass - loss regime ( fig . [ fig_sw ] ) . moreover , even assuming the maximum eddington factor of @xmath315 in equation ( [ eq_mdot_sw ] ) , the stellar wind mass - loss rate is lower than @xmath316 at @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that , the stellar wind is not important during the protostellar accretion phase .",
    "note , however , that during evolution after the mass accretion phase over timescales of @xmath317 , the stellar wind has important effect leading to significant mass - loss .    to conclude , in massive star formation by core accretion",
    ", we find that the mhd disk wind is most important feedback mechanism , radiation pressure assists the opening - up of the outflow cavity to wide angles , photoevaporation is regulated by the dust attenuation and is thus of minor importance , and stellar wind mass - loss has a very minor effect during the accretion phase . in the sense that the bipolar mhd - driven outflow is the most significant feedback ,",
    "massive star formation resembles low - mass star formation , however sfes can be significantly reduced by the action of radiative feedback .",
    "as we have seen , radiative feedback can significantly reduce sfe for the formation of very massive stars . considering the stellar imf to be the result of a multiplicative combination of the cmf and sfe",
    ", we can expect that the effects of radiative feedback may be seen in the high - mass end of the imf . while the mhd disk wind only feedback sets a sfe , which depends only weakly on the initial core mass , the full model including radiative feedback yields smaller sfes for higher core masses , @xmath280 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_sfe ] ) .",
    "potentially this could induce a steepening of the imf at the highest masses and if this is steep enough it may appear as an apparent truncation . using the obtained sfe , we can relate the imf to the cmf .",
    "we introduce the exponent of @xmath318 .",
    "if the cmf is a power - law distribution of @xmath319 and the exponent of @xmath320 is constant , then the imf would be @xmath321 @xcite .",
    "the sfes for massive cores with @xmath322@xmath50 and @xmath51@xmath55 obtained by our model are well fitted by @xmath323 within an error of @xmath324 .",
    "then , the power law exponent of the imf at @xmath325 is estimated as @xmath326 in clumps with @xmath238 . assuming an initial cmf slope of @xmath327 , i.e. , the same as the salpeter imf @xcite , the total number of stars with @xmath53@xmath215 is smaller than than that simply expected from the cmf slope by about @xmath328 due to mhd disk wind and radiative feedback . however , this reduction of massive stars is too small ( the reduction factor is about 55% for the mass range 100@xmath329 ) to explain the cut - off at @xmath36 reported for the arches cluster @xcite .",
    "thus we conclude that the high - mass end of imf , especially its potential truncation at masses @xmath12@xmath329 , is mainly determined by the pre - stellar core mass function rather than by feedback .      in this paper",
    ", we mainly study the formation of massive stars at solar metallicity .",
    "however , we have also applied our model to the primordial star formation case (  [ sec_popiii_model ] & [ sec_popiii_results ] ) in order to compare to previous studies and to obtain a basic insight into the effect of metallicity .",
    "our results show that the impact of radiative feedback depends strongly on such metallicity changes .",
    "since massive stars are thought to have been important thoughout cosmic history as metallicities have evolved from primoridal , near - zero limits to @xmath330solar values and beyond , here we give some general discussion about the dependence of radiative feedback , especially radiation pressure and photoevaporation mass - loss ( stellar wind feedback is weak at solar metallicity and would be even weaker at lower metallicities ) .",
    "however , we defer a detailed quantitative investigation of massive star formation at intermediate metallicities of @xmath331 to a future paper .",
    "radiation pressure is the strongest radiative feedback mechanism at solar metallicities .",
    "however , since it acts on dust grains in the infalling envelope , it must depend on metallicity .",
    "we have ignored dust re - emission since it is assumed to effectively escape from the outflow cavities .",
    "then , the momentum injection by radiation pressure can be evaluated assuming @xmath111 in equation ( [ eq_prad ] ) , as long as the envelope is optically thick for direct stellar radiation . in other words ,",
    "the effect of radiation pressure becomes weaker if the metallicity is low enough to keep the envelope transparent for direct stellar radiation .",
    "this transparency depends on the stellar spectrum and the grain components , but the typical opacity for direct stellar radiation is approximately evaluated as @xmath332 for massive stars assuming the opacity is simply proportional to metallicity .",
    "then , the trapping factor is approximately given by @xmath333.\\ ] ] assuming a typical massive core always forms in a clump with a mass surface density of @xmath54 , the effect of radiation pressure would become weaker for metallicities of @xmath334 .",
    "photoevaporation is strongly suppressed at solar metallicities because of the dust attenuation of ionizing photons . as described ",
    "[ sec_relative ] , the photoevaporation rate with dust attenuation is about @xmath335 of that of the dust - free case if @xmath254 .",
    "then , if the dust opacity for ionizing photons is simply proportional to the metallicity , we obtain the following relation of @xmath336 here we assume @xmath337 at solar metallicity as a typical value for the high ionizing photon production rate of @xmath338 at which photoevaporation mass - loss rate could be important ( eq .",
    "[ eq_cha_tau ] ) .",
    "therefore , the photoevaporation mass - loss rate could be as high as that at zero metallicity at metallicities of @xmath339 .",
    "considering both radiation pressure and photoevaporation , the critical metallicity for their transitions coincide at @xmath16 .",
    "dust absorption is efficient at higher metallicities than this critical value , which means that radiation pressure acts effectively . on the other hand ,",
    "photoevaporation is suppressed at these higher metallicities . in the lower metallicity regime dust absorption",
    "is weak , which lessens the impact of radiation pressure , while photoevapration is more effective .",
    "these considerations suggest that the total effects of radiative feedback may be strongest at @xmath16",
    ".    however , note that we are not suggesting that massive star formation is necessarily rarer at metallicities of @xmath340 . only that sfe could be lower .",
    "the core mass function will also play an important role , along with the typical clump mass surface density .",
    "it is difficult to predict how these will vary with metallicity , especially since they may also be more strongly influenced by the degree of magnetization of the gas .",
    "other processes , such as disk fragmentation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , may also play a role .",
    "even though our model predictions , including those from previous papers in this series , have some agreements with observations @xcite , this is a semi - analytic model that is still highly simplified and idealized .",
    "ultimately , the predictions of the model need to be tested by full radiation - mhd numerical simulations , especially to study the interaction of the outflow with the infall envelope and establishment of the outflow cavity boundary .",
    "below we discuss some additional caveats of our modeling .",
    "we have considered only single star formation .",
    "the massive cores are expected to be supported mainly by non - thermal pressures , i.e. , turbulence and magnetic fields , which keeps them from fragmenting to the thermal jeans mass of @xmath341 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "also the catastrophic fragmentation during collapse is expected to be suppressed by radiative heating by the high accretion luminosity and the efficient angular momentum transportation by magnetic breaking @xcite .",
    "however , a small amount of fragmentation may still occur , as seen simulations such as @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is observationally known that more than @xmath342 of massive stars have close companions which eventually exchange their masses @xcite .",
    "we expect that our model is still quantitatively appropriate since the feedback is dominated by a single object as long as the total stellar mass is dominated by a primary star in the binary / multiple system .",
    "on the other hand , our feedback model would need significantly modification if the system contains similar mass stars .",
    "qualitatively , we expect that radiative feedback in the case of similar mass binaries would be weaker than that in the case of formation of a single massive star .",
    "this is because the stellar luminosity increases nonlinearly with the mass .",
    "if some amount of material is divided into two objects , the total luminosity is smaller than that of a single star with the same total mass .",
    "in contrast , the momentum rate from mhd disk winds is roughly proportional to the total accretion rate .",
    "therefore , we expect that the conclusion that the mhd disk wind is the dominant feedback is correct also in the case of formation of a massive binary .    next , we did not study the case with very high accretion rate of @xmath343 , which would arise in the collapse of very unstable cores of @xmath344 ( eq . [ eq_mdot ] ) . even though the typical accretion rate of massive star formation is thought to be of the order of @xmath190 , there may be cases with higher accretion rates that are especially important for formation of very massive stars . in the case of zero metallicity ,",
    "@xcite have found a new branch of protostellar evolution at @xmath345 : the protostar balloons as @xmath346 without kh contraction .",
    "such `` supergiant '' protostars have low - effective temperatures of about @xmath347 and thus photoevaporation becomes ineffective , which is normally the most important feedback at zero metallicity .",
    "a similar phenomenon may appear also at solar metallicities , but it is non - trivial to calculate this evolution because of the presence of metals that alter the protostellar evolution @xcite . due to this uncertainty of protostellar evolution and also the numerical difficulty of calculation of supergiant protostars ,",
    "we have avoided models with parameter range of @xmath348 in this paper . however , even without detailed calculations , we can expect that the mhd disk wind is still the most dominant feedback in the cases of such rapid accretion .",
    "this is because the momentum rate of mhd disk wind is proportional to the accretion rate , while the radiation pressure acts similarly as in lower - accretion rate case , and the photoevaporation becomes negligible in the supergiant protostar phase if it appears at solar metallicity .",
    "future work on accurate protostellar evolution calculations with @xmath345 at solar metallicities is needed to confirm this expectation .",
    "we also did not consider short timescale variations of accretion rates , which may be induced by disk instabilties , e.g. , due to self - gravity .",
    "@xcite simulated the formation of a massive star and showed the accretion bursts occur repetitively .",
    "the accretion rate rapidly increases from @xmath349@xmath350 to @xmath351 within a duration of @xmath53 years and it recurs with the timescale of several kyr .",
    "the accretion burst has a significant impact on the observational aspects , since it results in luminosity outbursts similar to fu orionis objects . considering the evolution of the infalling envelope under the influence of feedback , however , we suspect that the accretion burst does not have too significant an impact .",
    "this is because the global evolution of the infalling envelope is affected by the accretion rate averaged over the accretion timescale of @xmath352 , which is longer than the expected durations and recurrence timescales of accretion bursts .",
    "accretion bursts would also change the protostellar evolution , since , as described in the previous paragraph , such high - accretion rates can cause a supergiant phase .",
    "however , @xcite showed that , at least in zero - metallicity case , the supergiant phase can not last as long as the recurrence timescale of @xmath353 since the kh timescale is very short . to check these speculations , further study , deferred to a future paper ,",
    "is needed to include accretion bursts self - consistently in our modeling .",
    "in addition to further theoretical and numerical studies , better observational tests are needed to confirm the reliability of our theoretical model .",
    "we have applied the previous versions of our model to make predictions of observational features using radiative transfer calculations @xcite . in a future paper",
    "we will model the radiative transfer predictions of the feedback models that we have presented here .",
    "we have investigated the impact of multiple feedback mechanisms in massive star formation by core accretion , and calculated the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) from pre - stellar cores .",
    "our model includes feedback by the outflows driven by momenta from mhd disk winds and radiation pressure , and the effects of mass - loss by photoevaporation and stellar winds .",
    "we found the mhd disk wind is the dominant feedback mechanism for all cases considered , while radiation pressure can cause a significant reduction in sfe at the highest masses and especially in lower mass surface density clumps .",
    "the obtained sfe can be fitted as @xmath354 in the initial core mass range of @xmath322@xmath5 at the ambient clump mass surface density of @xmath54 , which is a typical value for massive star formation .",
    "the gentle decline of @xmath355 is caused by the radiative feedback which is stronger at higher masses .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the shape of high - mass end of initial stellar mass function , especially potential truncation at @xmath356@xmath329 , is mainly determined by the pre - stellar core mass function and/or disk fragmentation rather than the effects of feedback .",
    "the mhd disk wind provides the major portion ( @xmath357 ) of outflow momentum over all the considered mass range , and drives the outflow before the stellar mass reaches about @xmath358 , when radiation pressure acting on dust grains in a spherical envelope becomes stronger than the gravitational force .",
    "such radiation pressure was once thought to be a potential barrier for massive star formation , but in more realistic disk accretion and outflow cavity geometries , the strong direct stellar radiation is shielded in the disk - shadowed region , and dust re - emission escapes along the cavities . therefore , feedback by radiation pressure is not a catastrophic problem for massive star formation .",
    "still , although the total momentum is dominated by the mhd disk wind , radiation pressure also assists to open the outflow cavity to wider angles , since it acts more isotropically than the collimated mhd outflow .",
    "mass - loss by photoevaporation is strongly suppressed by dust attenuation of ionizing photons . when the protostar starts the kelvin - helmholtz contraction at @xmath53@xmath23 , the ionizing photon rate increases with the effective temperature and the photoevaporation starts .",
    "however , as the mass - loss rate increases , the photoevaporation flow becomes opaque for the ionizing radiation due to dust opacity .",
    "thus , the photoevaporation mass - loss rate is regulated to @xmath359 , which is @xmath360 of the mass - loss rate without dust attenuation .",
    "since the typical accretion rates of massive star formation are @xmath350 , photoevaporation has only a minor impact for the sfe at solar metallicities .",
    "the mass - loss by stellar wind is found to be @xmath361 , and thus is not important to set the stellar mass .",
    "the stellar wind is , however , very important for the later evolution over timescales of several million years , i.e. , the total mass - loss can be tens of @xmath362 .",
    "we also applied our model to primordial , pop iii star formation . due to the lack of dust grains at zero metallicity ,",
    "the radiation pressure is negligible and also dust attenuation of ionizing photons does not occur .",
    "therefore , photoevaporation is the major feedback effect in primordial star formation . in our fiducial model ,",
    "the photoevaporation rate reaches @xmath28 and stops the mass accretion at about @xmath363 . in this manner ,",
    "radiation feedback depends on metallicity , mainly due to the dust absorption .",
    "we evaluated that the critical metallicity for two radiative feedback transitions is @xmath16 .",
    "dust absorption is effective at higher metallicities than this critical metallicity , which results in radiation pressure being strong while photoevaporation is suppressed . on the other hand , at lower metallicities dust absorption is weak and so radiation pressure eventually becomes negligible and the photoevaporation is more important .",
    "since massive stars are thought to have been astrophysically important since the times of the first stars , more detailed studies are needed to investigate the quantitative effects of feedback as a function of metallicity .",
