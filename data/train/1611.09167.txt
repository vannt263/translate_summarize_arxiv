    "hydrogeological paths exhibit often a complex behavior .",
    "such irregularities are driven by the presence of several factors of uncertainty in the climate dynamics .",
    "river streamflows represent paradigmatic examples of this evidence .",
    "in fact , human activities and natural events drive the fluctuations , sometimes with catastrophic effects , of such phenomena .",
    "this paper elaborates some crucial observations from these premises . in particular",
    ", we develop an analysis of the streamflow of the paglia river , a major tributary of tiber , whose watercourse is entirely localized in central italy .",
    "data are the official measurements of the streamflow of the river at ponte delladunata , near orvieto , a historical town in umbria region .",
    "the time interval covered by the measurements is january 1st , 1992 ( 12:00am )  may 13 , 2014 ( h11:30pm ) , and the periodicity of the observations is 30 minutes .",
    "however , the pervasive presence of missing values in the first part of the series prevented us from using the data prior to november 2 , 1992 ( h12:30pm ) .",
    "we specifically focus on the so - called _ long run dependence property _ of the series , which gives a thoughtful view of the behavior of the autocorrelation function .",
    "such a statistical property can be suitably employed for making forecasts on the future evolution of the streamflow .",
    "the perspective presented here is in line with the original , path - breaking study by [ @xcite ] , who explored the long - run dependence of the runoffs of the nile river .",
    "the analysis is based on the assessment of the value of the constant @xmath0  the so - called _",
    "hurst exponent _  which represents the rate of decay of the autocorrelation function of the series as a function of the time - lag .",
    "if @xmath1 , the series is said to present a persistent behavior , which basically means that the history of the past will `` statistically '' repeat in the future ; @xmath2 stands for antipersistence , the opposite of persistence ; @xmath3 is the pure random case .    since its inception , several contributions dealing with the assessment of the hurst exponent in a number of very different contexts have appeared in the literature ; a complete list is too long to be mentioned here .    in detecting long - run dependence ,",
    "river discharges are of particular interest .",
    "in fact , they offer very specific time series with peculiar features .",
    "first of all , they have periodicities , with different periods .",
    "such a property is due to the strong relationship between the river streamflow dynamics , the weather and the precipitation , but also to the effects of the global warming over the hydrogeological systems of the planet earth [ @xcite-@xcite ] .    under the point of view of the human activities ,",
    "it is self - evident how the fluctuations of the streamflow of any river affect ( positively or negatively ) the socio - economic system of the surrounding areas . in this respect ,",
    "the paglia river and the municipality of orvieto represent very interesting cases to treat .",
    "in fact , there is a high level of hydrogeological risk related to paglia s floods in the orvieto area : the last important flood took place on november 12 , 2012 , causing injuries and huge damages to the local economy . an effective plan to deal with this recurring phenomenon should necessarily move from a deep knowledge of the dynamics of the river and a forecast of when and how a flood will take place in the future .    from a purely technical viewpoint ,",
    "we proceed by applying the _ detrended fluctuation analysis _",
    "( dfa )  introduced by [ @xcite ]  which is classically acknowledged to be a powerful tool for the estimation of the hurst exponent , whence long term persistence effects , mainly in the presence of non - stationarities .",
    "the appeal of the dfa lies in its conceptualization .",
    "indeed , the underlying theoretical framework can be found in the theory of random walks [ @xcite ] .",
    "in such a context , time series are opportunely aggregated .",
    "this reduces the noise level due to biases in measurements .    in the context of dfa applications",
    ", it is worth mentioning [ @xcite-@xcite ] .    as an ancillary analysis",
    ", we also consider the `` validity '' of the data measured at ponte delladunata .",
    "we do not infirm its interest , of course , but we wish to point some possible defects impairing a finer analysis as that presented here .",
    "in fact , the subsequent discussion and conclusions might be the first of this sort in the present context . for this purpose , and in accordance with [ @xcite ] observations of river streamflows in the usa",
    ", we check if data fit benford s law [ @xcite ] .",
    "in fact , such an empirical rule ( on the logarithmic distribution of the first digit in lengthy data ) has been found to hold in a wide spectrum of cases ; see , e.g. , ( and the references therein ] [ @xcite-@xcite ] . when violated , the presence of some sort of data manipulation or mistakes in data collection has to be debated .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in the next section ( sect . [",
    "sec : datamethod ] ) we introduce the dataset and the methodologies . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] we present and discuss the results . in the last section ( sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] ) , we offer some concluding remarks .",
    "the paglia river is an important right - side tributary of tiber , the third longest river in italy .",
    "it is about 86km - long , with many tributaries along its course .",
    "it is characterized by a very variable streamflow ( see table  [ tab : descr.stats ] and figure  [ fig : paglia_series_log ] ) which gives paglia a crucial role in determining the floods of tiber .",
    "data , obtained from an hydrometer station run by the umbria regional authority , measure the streamflow ( expressed in @xmath4 ) of the paglia river at ponte delladunata , just downstream of the confluence of chiani river , a 42km - long left - side tributary of paglia .",
    "because of the presence of many long measurement interruptions during the first ten months of 1992 , in our analysis we consider measurements recorded at each half hour starting on november 2 , 1992 ( h12:30pm ) , until may 13 , 2014 ( h11:30pm ) .",
    "there are still a few missing values in the selected period ( in 7 occurrences the interruption of the measurements lasted for more than 2 days ) .",
    "such missing values have been linearly interpolated on the series expressed in logarithms . and packages benford.analysis [ @xcite ] , fractal [ @xcite ] , ggplot2 [ @xcite ] , imputets [ @xcite ] , moments [ @xcite ] , psd [ @xcite ] , xts [ @xcite ] . ]",
    "the resulting series ( plotted in logs in figure  [ fig : paglia_series_log ] ) includes 377,399 observations .",
    "streamflow ( expressed in @xmath5 ) of the paglia river measured at every half hour between november 2 , 1992 and may 13 , 2014 . ticks on the x - axis identify the beginning of the years , except the the last tick that indicates the last available observation . ]",

    "this paper presents the analysis of the paglia river streamflow .",
    "the dataset used is of large size : the considered series has 30-minutes period over a time - span of more than 22 years .",
    "the data series is antipersistent , with an average hurst exponent of about @xmath7 .",
    "this gives a precise information on how one can do forecast on the overflow of the considered river .",
    "furthermore , we show that in recent years there has been an increasing trend in the maxima of the river streamflows , and a periodicity which broadly suggests a connection of the streamflows with el nio and the north atlantic oscillations",
    ". however , more accurate measurements of the streamflow could be useful in having a more consistent dataset .",
    "we also show that the paglia river streamflow is well represented by a discrete generalized beta distribution , congruent with the observed river discharge being the result of the interaction of many complex subsystems .",
