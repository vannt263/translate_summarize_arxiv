    "topological insulator  @xcite ( ti ) materials host on their boundaries a novel type of topological states of quantum matter , which , unlike the quantum hall state , exist without the breaking of time - reversal symmetry .",
    "@xcite theoretical prediction and subsequent experimental demonstration of these topological states in both two- @xcite ( 2d ) and three - dimensional  @xcite ( 3d ) systems have given rise to what is now one of the most rapidly developing fields in condensed matter physics .",
    "apart from providing a test platform for fundamental concepts , the study of tis holds promise for novel applications in materials science and chemistry ,  @xcite spintronics  @xcite and quantum computation .",
    "@xcite however , to be able to fully explore the potential of tis , it is essential to have a detailed knowledge of the nature and properties of topological surface states in real ti materials ,  @xcite as well as a quantitative understanding of how they respond to external perturbations .",
    "@xcite experimentally , these questions are being addressed with advanced surface - sensitive experimental probes , such as spin- and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy  @xcite [ ( sr)-arpes ] and scanning tunneling microscopy  @xcite ( stm ) .",
    "along with experimental advances , there is a growing need for atomistic modeling of tis that would enable quantitative predictions and direct comparison with experiment .",
    "significant progress has been made in using _",
    "ab initio _ methods to calculate electronic  @xcite and magnetic  @xcite properties of tis .",
    "however , such methods suffer from severe computational limitations , particularly in the case of slab geometry as well as surface supercell calculations , which are employed in studies of impurity - doping effects .",
    "in addition , more accurate _",
    "ab initio _ methods often lack the conceptual transparency and flexibility of the model hamiltonian approaches , which have been of fundamental importance for driving progress in this research field .",
    "@xcite microscopic tight - binding ( tb ) models , which have already proved successful in quantitative description of electronic and magnetic properties of semiconductors ,  @xcite may provide a convenient platform to address similar issues in tis .",
    "several studies have recently appeared in the literature , in which tb descriptions with different level of complexity have been introduced , ranging from models built on a simplified lattice structure  @xcite or a restricted orbital basis set inferred from symmetry arguments  @xcite to fully microscopic models , with parameters extracted from density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "@xcite to date , the latter class of models is still the least represented among the model hamiltonian approaches to tis .    in this work",
    "we employ a microscopic tb model to study the properties of surface states in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , a prototypical 3d ti , which belongs , along with bi@xmath0te@xmath1 and sb@xmath0te@xmath1 , to the family of binary tetradymite semiconductors with layered structure .",
    "@xcite although these materials have been studied for decades due to their excellent thermoelectric properties ,  @xcite they have recently attracted considerable attention as 3d tis , e.g. materials that exhibit topologically protected conducting surface states with linear ( dirac ) dispersion and helical spin - texture , traversing the bulk insulating gap .",
    "@xcite due to a relatively large band gap ( 0.3  ev for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ) and rather simple surface states , consisting of a single dirac cone ,  @xcite the bi@xmath0se@xmath1 family of 3d tis is the most studied both experimentally and theoretically .    our treatment is based on the _ _ sp__@xmath2 slater - koster hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite we use the parametrization developed by kobayashi ,  @xcite by fitting to dft calculations . throughout this work",
    ", our strategy has been to make use of the computational efficiency and simplifications , offered by the tb approach , in order to investigate key features of the surface states in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 3d ti , which are inaccessible by _ ab initio _ methods .",
    "importantly , we consider slabs with thicknesses ranging from 1 to 100 quintuple layers ( qls ) , which corresponds to length scales in the range of 1 - 100 nm . in contrast",
    ", thicknesses typically investigated in _ ab - initio_based studies do not exceed several quintuple layers .",
    "@xcite in agreement with previous reports ,  @xcite we find a gap due to interaction between opposite surfaces , which decreases with increasing the slab thickness . starting from 5 qls , the size of the gap becomes smaller than @xmath3  ev , and one can identify surface states with linear dispersion and helical spin - texture .",
    "for each slab thickness we determine the surface character of bloch states using the procedure put forward in ref .  ,",
    "i.e. based on the contribution of the real - space projected wavefunction onto the two surfaces of the slab",
    ".    explicit calculations of the atomic- and orbital - projections of the wavefunctions , associated with valence and conduction band extrema in both bulk and slab geometry , allowed us to construct a phenomenological picture of band inversion .",
    "the latter effect is induced by spin - orbit interaction and is responsible for the occurrence of topological surface states across the bulk insulating gap .",
    "@xcite furthermore , based on a similar analysis , we were able to track the changes in the spatial distribution and the spin character of the surface states wavefunctions at and in the vicinity of the dirac point , for increasing slab thickness .",
    "our calculations showed that the states corresponding to top and bottom surfaces become completely decoupled , i.e. spatially separated , only for very thick slabs containing @xmath4 qls .",
    "we also calculated the spin - orientation of the surface states in momentum space as a function of thickness .",
    "the disturbances in the helical spin - texture , expressed through in - plane and out - of - plane tilting angles of the spin , are shown to be significant for thin slabs up to 10 qls and are manifestations of both inter - surface interaction and the proximity to bulk states .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ theo ]",
    "we discuss the details of the tb model and some computational aspects .",
    "the results of the simulations are presented in section  [ results ] .",
    "we begin in section  [ bulk ] by analyzing the effect of so on the bulk bandstructures , where the bulk band inversion is interpreted as a characteristic change in the spatial distributions of the orbital - resolved projections of the wavefunctions at conductance and valence band extrema at the @xmath5 point .",
    "the results of surface bandstructure calculations are presented in section  [ slab ] , in particular the spatial character of the states emerging within the bulk gap and the opening of the gap at finite thicknesses are described quantitatively in section  [ gap ] .",
    "we also discuss the procedure to identify the inverted character on conduction and valence bands in the presence of so for a slab geometry . in section  [ wf_atg ] , based on the analysis of the wavefunctions of the states at the dirac point ,",
    "a quantitative criterion of an infinitely thick slab , with no interaction between the surfaces , is formulated .",
    "in addition , we comment on the orbital character of the wavefunctions at the dirac point , especially on the non - negligible contribution of the in - plane @xmath6-orbitals .",
    "the spin - properties of the dirac - cone states and deviations from the perfect spin - momentum locking due to inter - surface interaction and the presence of bulk states are calculated in section  [ spin ] .",
    "finally , section  [ concl ] contains our conclusions .",
    "we begin with a brief description of the crystal structure and chemical bonding of materials belonging to the bi@xmath0se@xmath1 family .",
    "bi@xmath0se@xmath1 has a rhombohedral crystal structure with crystallographic @xmath7 [ @xmath8 space group , with five atoms in the unit cell [ see fig .",
    "[ fig0](a ) ] .",
    "the crystal is formed by stacking of hexagonal monolayers of either bi or se in a close - packed fcc ( abc ) fashion .",
    "the sequence of five atomic layers , i.e. se1-bi - se2-bi - se1 , forms a ql [ see fig .",
    "[ fig0](b ) ] , with se1 and se2 indicating two nonequivalent positions of se atom .",
    "hence it is convenient to describe the crystal structure of bulk bi@xmath0se@xmath1 in terms of qls stacked along the direction perpendicular to atomic planes ( _ c_-axis ) .",
    "( a ) rhombohedral unit cell of the bulk crystal .",
    "se1 and se2 refer to two non - equivalent positions of se atoms .",
    "( b ) the structure of 1 ql formed by five alternating atomic layers of bi and se .",
    "( c ) the brillouin zone of the bulk crystal and that of the ( 111 ) surface of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 . ]",
    "the chemical bonding between atoms in the atomic layers within a ql is of covalent - ionic type with dominant covalent character .",
    "adjacent qls are weakly bound through se1-se1 bonds by van der waals forces ,  @xcite allowing easy cleavage of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 on the ( 111 ) se surface plane .",
    "based on the electronic configurations of bi and se , with the outermost orbitals being of @xmath6-character for both types of atoms , it is reasonable to expect that the bonding within qls is mainly due to interactions between @xmath6-orbitals .",
    "in fact , a simple but useful physical picture of the chemical bonding present in qls features @xmath9-chains formed by strongly interacting @xmath6-orbitals of atoms in nearest - neighbors atomic layers .",
    "evidence of this coupling can be indirectly inferred from stm topographies of bi - antisites defects in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite in sections  [ bulk ] and [ slab ] , we will comment on the orbital character of the valence and conduction band extrema in bulk bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and of surface states in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 slab , respectively .",
    "for modeling of the electronic structure of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 we employ the _ _ sp__@xmath2 tb model with slater - koster parameters obtained by kobayashi  @xcite by fitting to bulk bandstructures calculated with dft .",
    "interactions between atoms in the same atomic layer and between atoms in first and second nearest - neighbor layers are included .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction ( so ) , which is the key element leading to a non - trivial bulk band structure and metallic surface states , is incorporated in the intra - atomic matrix elements .",
    "@xcite thus the hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the reciprocal - lattice vector that spans the brillouin zone , @xmath12 is the atomic index , @xmath13 labels atomic orbitals @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 denotes the spin .",
    "here @xmath19 refers to the atomic positions in the unit cell , while @xmath20@xmath21@xmath19 runs over all neighbors of atom @xmath19 , including atoms in the adject cells , with @xmath22 being the vector connecting the two atoms ( @xmath22=@xmath23 for @xmath19=@xmath20 ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath24 are the slater - koster parameters ( for @xmath19=@xmath20 @xmath25 give the on - site energies ) and @xmath26 is the creation(annihilation ) operator for an electron with spin @xmath27 at the atomic orbital @xmath28 of site @xmath19 . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) represents the on - site so , where @xmath29 are spin- and orbital - resolved atomic orbitals , @xmath30 is the orbital angular momentum operator and @xmath31 is the spin operator ; @xmath32 is the so strength .",
    "we refer to ref .   for the exact parametrization of @xmath24 and @xmath32 .    in bulk - bandstructure calculations we use the rhombohedral unit cell with five nonequivalent atoms , with the cell repeated periodically in @xmath33- , @xmath34- and @xmath35-directions .",
    "in calculations involving the bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ( @xmath36 ) surface we consider a slab consisting of @xmath37 quintuple layers , or , equivalently , of @xmath38 atomic layers .",
    "since each atomic layer is an equilateral triangular lattice , it is sufficient to assign one atom per each layer , which gives a total of @xmath38 atoms in the slab unit cell .",
    "the slab is finite along the @xmath35-direction ( ql - stacking axis ) , with the unit cell repeated periodically in the @xmath33-@xmath34 plane . using this tb model",
    "we were able to compute bandstructures of slabs with thicknesses up to @xmath39 qls with a reasonable computational cost .",
    "the presence of gapless edge or surface states , robust against time - reversal - invariant perturbations , distinguishes a topological insulating phase from a trivial one .",
    "however , in order to elucidate the origin of the topological order in existing tis and to facilitate the search for new ti materials , it is necessary to have a set of criteria that allow us to differentiate between topologically trivial and non - trivial insulators , based on the information about their bulk properties . within the framework of topological band theory ,  @xcite time - reversal - invariant insulators",
    "are classified according to a @xmath40 topological invariant , assigned to their bandstructure . in 2d",
    "there is a single @xmath40 invariant , which distinguishes the quantum spin - hall state ( 2d ti ) , as in hgte / cdte quantum wells , from an ordinary insulator . in 3d",
    "a set of four @xmath40 invariants leads to a classification based of three classes , namely strong tis , weak tis and ordinary insulators . for systems with inversion symmetry ,",
    "the @xmath40 invariant is determined by the product of the parity eigenvalues of occupied bands at the time - reversal - invariant momenta in the brillouin zone .",
    "@xcite using this scheme , a few strong tis have been predicted , such as strained @xmath28-sn and hgte , bi@xmath41sb@xmath42 and bi@xmath0se@xmath1-like 3d tis .    the emergence of topological order can be understood using the concept of _ band inversion_.  @xcite clearly , a necessary condition for a ti is the existence of a non - trivial bulk band gap .",
    "in fact , in the above mentioned materials , a topological phase transition , or alternatively a change in the value of the @xmath40 invariant which in turn implies the existence of gapless states on the boundary , is accompanied by a visible and well - defined change in the bandstructure .",
    "this change occurs precisely in the insulating gap and can be observed as a function of an external or an intrinsic parameter . in hgte , which is a zero - gap semiconductor but acquires a gap due to external potential in a quantum well structure , the bands with @xmath43- and @xmath6-character are inverted with respect to their usual sequence at the @xmath44 point .",
    "@xcite a similar mechanism is realized in strained @xmath28-sn , which has recently been shown to exhibit a 3d ti phase , with dirac - like surface states emanating from the second lowest valence band across the strained - induced gap .",
    "@xcite in bi@xmath41sb@xmath42 alloy the inverted bandstructure is characterized by a change in the order of the bands with even ( @xmath45 ) and odd ( @xmath46 ) parity at the @xmath47 point of the brillouin zone compared to pure bi .",
    "this inversion is induced by sb doping and is due to the strong ti character of the valence band of pure sb .",
    "@xcite in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 3d ti a non - trivial bulk band gap owns its existence to so , with the parity of the valence and conduction band inverted at the @xmath44 point .",
    "@xcite without so the material would be a trivial insulator .",
    "however , in the presence of so the change in the parity of one of the occupied bands leads to a change in the value of the @xmath40 invariant , signaling a topological phase transition .    an intuitive way of describing band inversion theoretically is to look at charge density distributions of the inverted bands at the point of the brillouin zone , where the inversion is expected to occur , as functions of a characteristic parameter .",

    "the calculated bandstructures without and with so are shown in fig .",

    "the brillouin zone of the bulk crystal and the path along the high - symmetry directions are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig0](c ) . ]",
    "to further quantify the changes in the valence and conduction band character , we calculate the atomic- and orbital - projections of the wavefunctions associated with the eigenvalues at the valence - band minimum ( vbm ) [ filled circles in fig .",

    "the most noticeable feature of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is the _ inversion _ in the spatial distribution of the wavefunctions when so is switched on . without",
    "so the cbm wavefunction has a node at se2 , which is in fact the inversion center of the bulk crystal , with the maximum weight on the two bi atoms .",
    "in contrast , the maximum weight of the vbm wavefunction is distributed over se2 and two se1 atoms .",
    "with so the situation is the opposite : now the vbm wavefunction has a node at se2 while the cbm wavefunction is predominantly localized on se atoms .",

    ", we will discuss the results of bandstructure calculations for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 slabs , namely the emergence of conducting states across the inverted bulk gap in the presence of so .",
    "in particular , we will show that the band inversion , characteristic of the bulk gap , can also be identified in the surface bandstructures .",
    "the bandstructures of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 slab of varying thickness , calculated using the tb model including so , are shown in fig .",

    "@xcite the size of the gap decreases with increasing the film thickness and is almost negligible for 6 qls , which is quantitatively consistent with our numerical observations . such gap - opening mechanism has been considered for possible applications in ti - based mosfet devices .",
    "@xcite    the value of the gap for increasing slab thickness is plotted in fig .",
    "interestingly , we find that the gap initially decreases and reaches the value of @xmath63  ev for 5 qls but then increases up to @xmath64  ev for 6 qls .",
    "after this sudden increase , the gap continues to decrease exponentially and we find @xmath58=@xmath65  ev for 10 qls .",

    "since the gap decreases exponentially , we do not display the results for thicknesses greater that 10 qls .",

    "[ fig3 ] , namely on the procedure used to identify the surface states in the bandstructure calculations .",
    "the character of each bloch state @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the band index and @xmath69 is momentum , is determined by the spatial distribution of the corresponding wavefunction :  @xcite if the relative weight of the atom - projected wavefunction @xmath70 on the top and bottom qls exceeds a critical value ( critical percentage ) @xmath71 , @xmath72 is identified as a surface state .",
    "such criterion is reasonable for slabs with thickness greater than 3 qls , since the typical penetration depth of the surface states in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is of the order of 1 ql , or 1  nm .",
    "@xcite for ultra - thin slabs with thickness below 3qls , the criterion has to be modified , namely we calculate the wavefunction projections onto top two and bottom two atomic layers .",
    "the value of the critical percentage is found empirically .",
    "starting from a rough estimate of @xmath71 based on the ratio between the penetration depth and the slab thickness , the value should then be optimized in such a way that a small change around this value does not significantly modify the resulting distribution of the surface states .",
    "we find , however , that for 1 - 3 qls the identification of such an optimized value of @xmath71 is problematic .",
    "to illustrate this point , we present the results of calculations for two different values of @xmath71 . in the case of 1 ql and @xmath71=@xmath73 , for instance , all states in the range of energies considered can be identified as surface states .",
    "hence , for such a thin slab it is reasonable to use a stronger criterion .",

    "[ fig3](a ) , for @xmath71=@xmath74 only the upper band preserves the surface character while the lower band does not satisfy the criterion ( we use terms `` lower '' and `` upper '' for the two bands defining the gap ) .",

    ", varying @xmath71 in the range of @xmath76-@xmath77% induces some visible changes in the distribution of the surface states , however , the surface character of the dirac - like states is well captured for any value of @xmath71 in this range . for slabs with thicknesses greater than 3 qls",
    ", the search for an optimized value of @xmath71 is significantly simplified .",

[ fig6](b ) ] . in the case of 5 qls , when the gap at the @xmath5 point is more appreciable , there is a clear difference between the spatial profiles of the wavefunctions , associated with the two degenerate states [ fig .",

    "the direction of the spin at each @xmath69 appears to be tangential to the equi - energy contour , which is a manifestation of the spin - momentum locking intrinsic to 3d tis .",
    "@xcite the direction of the spin is exactly opposite for the states @xmath105 and @xmath106 , hence the top and bottom surface states have opposite helicities .",

    "[ fig8](a ) ] . ]    in order to investigate the effect of the slab thickness on the helical spin - texture of the surface states , we determine the orientation of the spin @xmath108 of the bloch states @xmath101 for thicknesses in the range of 5 to 20 qls .",
    "the orientation of vector @xmath108 in momentum space at each @xmath69 can be described by two angles : @xmath109 , or in - plane tilting angle , which is the angle between @xmath108 and the normal to the contour at point @xmath69 , and @xmath110 , or out - of - plane tilting angle , which in the angle between @xmath108 and the direction perpendicular to the plane [ see fig .  [ fig10](c ) ] . for a perfect spin - momentum locking @xmath109=@xmath110=@xmath111 .",
    "note that the angles @xmath109 and @xmath110 oscillate as functions of @xmath69 along the equi - energy contour due to the three - fold rotational symmetry of the slab crystal structure .",

    "hence we compute the deviations of @xmath109 and @xmath110 from @xmath111 only for the top state .",
    "the resulting absolute - value deviations , averaged over @xmath112 on the equi - energy contour , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , are plotted as functions of the thickness in figs .

    "( c ) orientation of @xmath108 in momentum space : @xmath109 is the angle between @xmath115 and the normal @xmath116 to the equi - energy contour , @xmath110 is the angle between @xmath108 and the direction perpendicular to the plane .",
    "we define @xmath117=@xmath118 ; @xmath119 is the average of @xmath117 over @xmath69 on the equi - energy contour . ]",
    "both in - plane and out - of - plane deviations decrease with increasing the slab thickness .",
    "the dependence of @xmath113 shows a kink at 6 qls , consistent with the increase of the gap at the @xmath5 point ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , while @xmath114 decreases monotonically .",
    "importantly , both @xmath120 and @xmath114 do not decrease to zero with increasing the thickness but instead saturate to a constant value .",
    "the saturation value is small for @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) and relatively large for @xmath114 ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "the saturation starts at approximately 10 qls for @xmath113 and at 7 qls for @xmath114 .",
    "the non - zero residual deviation from the perfect helical spin - texture at large thicknesses is a measure of the proximity of the equi - energy contour to bulk states .",
    "the further the contour is from the dirac point , the stronger is the effect of the bulk continuum , with hexagonal wrapping in momentum space due to crystal symmetry , on the surface states located on the contour . for an equi - energy contour located at a higher energy (",
    "@xmath123  ev ) we find considerably larger saturation values , namely @xmath124 for @xmath114 and @xmath125 for @xmath113 . to summarize , both in - plane and out - of plane deviations decrease with increasing the slab thickness and with moving the equi - energy contour closer to the dirac point .",
    "however in the vicinity of the dirac point the in - plane tilting angle appears to be more affected by the finite thickness while the out - of - plane tilting angle is more sensitive to the presence of bulk states .",
    "we have employed the _ _ sp__@xmath2 tight - binding model , with parameters extracted from _ ab initio _ calculations , to model the electronic structure of bulk and ( 111 ) surface of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 3d ti .",
    "we presented a quantitative description of the band inversion mechanism for both bulk and slab geometry , which involves a detectable change in the spatial distribution of @xmath6-orbital projections of the wavefunctions of conduction and valence bands induced by spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the surface bandstructures , with the spatial character of bloch states determined by quantitative criteria , were calculated for slabs with thicknesses up to 100 qls .",
    "this thickness is well beyond what is accessible by _ ab initio _ approaches .",
    "based of the calculated thickness - dependent gap due to inter - surface interaction and the atomic - projections of the wavefunctions for states at the @xmath5 point , we found that the infinite - thickness limit , characterized by zero gap and no interaction between the surfaces , is realized for 40 qls .",
    "furthermore , our calculations showed that the disturbances in the helical spin - texture of the dirac - cone states , caused by the finite slab thickness and the proximity to bulk states , persist for thicknesses up to 10 qls even in the vicinity of the dirac point .",
    "we would like to comment on our numerical observation that the top and bottom surface states become completely decoupled only for thick slabs containing 40 qls . strictly speaking only states with linear dispersion and identically",
    "zero gap at the dirac point can be identified as dirac states . however , in practice our observation does not contradict the commonly accepted results that 6 qls is the critical thickness which determines the topological character of the material .",
    "@xcite indeed , we found that the gap for thicknesses greater that 5 qls is very small ( of the order of @xmath126  ev and smaller ) and the surface states appearing inside the bulk insulating gap at these thicknesses have nearly linear dispersion and helical spin - texture .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of a weak but finite interaction between the opposite surfaces for slabs of less than 40 qls thick might be crucial for the analysis of subtle effects in the vicinity of the dirac point .",
    "preliminary calculations have shown that even a small perturbation preserving the time - reversal symmetry can open a gap for thicknesses as large as 20 qls .",
    "@xcite this may further hinder the identification of the gap induced purely by the presence of time - reversal - breaking perturbations , such as magnetic impurities ,  @xcite in calculations based on tight - binding models similar to ours and certainly in _ ab initio _ studies , where thicknesses are limited to only few qls .",
    "effects due to finite thickness can be also expected in landau levels spectroscopy of 3d ti thin films .",
    "@xcite on one hand , it has been shown experimentally that in bi@xmath0se@xmath1-like materials the characteristic field - independent ( zero - th ) landau level is absent for slabs with thicknesses smaller than 3 qls but emerges already for 4 qls .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , a recent theoretical study suggests a splitting of the zero - th landau level due to hybridization between top and bottom surface states .",
    "@xcite based on these considerations , one might expect that a non - negligible inter - surface interaction can lead to more subtle internal structure of the zero - th landau level , persisting even for relatively large thicknesses .",
    "we anticipate that microscopic tight - binding models , combined with input from _ ab initio _ calculations , will play an increasingly important role in practical calculations of various properties of ti materials .",
    "these include the detailed character of the surfaces states wavefunction , which to some extent can be already probed experimentally ,  @xcite and the interplay between the surfaces states and external perturbations .",
    "@xcite in fact , a finite - cluster tight - binding approach , based on the model used in the present work , has been already employed in the study of native defects in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , showing good agreement between the calculated local densities of states around the defects and experimental stm topographies .",
    "@xcite in connection to this last point , we would like to mention that despite extensive studies of the effect of magnetic doping in 3d tis , a consistent microscopic description of a single magnetic impurity in a ti environment appears to be incomplete , especially when compared to the progress that has been made in investigating similar questions in semiconductors , both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally.@xcite a realistic tight - binding approach can be indispensable in providing such a microscopic description for single impurities in 3d tis .",

    "<S> we report on microscopic tight - binding modeling of surface states in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 three - dimensional topological insulator , based on a _ _ sp__@xmath2 slater - koster hamiltonian , with parameters calculated from density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of spin - orbit interaction on the electronic structure of the bulk and of a slab with finite thickness is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a phenomenological criterion of band inversion is formulated for both bulk and slab , based on the calculated atomic- and orbital - projections of the wavefunctions , associated with valence and conduction band extrema at the center of the brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out a thorough analysis of the calculated bandstructures of slabs with varying thickness , where surface states are identified using a quantitative criterion according to their spatial distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the thickness - dependent energy gap , attributed to inter - surface interaction , and the emergence of gapless surface states for slabs above a critical thickness are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we map out the transition to the infinite - thickness limit by calculating explicitly the modifications in the spatial distribution and spin - character of the surface states wavefunction with increasing the slab thickness . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical analysis shows that the system must be approximately forty quintuple - layers thick to exhibit completely decoupled surface states , localized on the opposite surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> these results have implications on the effect of external perturbations on the surface states near the dirac point . </S>"
