    "a _ wban _ is a wireless short range communication network comprises of a single coordinator and multiple low power and wearable sensors for collecting the human personal data .",

    "_ wban__s such as ubiquitous health care , medical treatment , consumer electronics , sports and military @xcite .",
    "for example , the involved sensors may be observing the heart and the brain electrical activities as well as blood pressure , core temperature , oxygen saturation , carbon dioxide concentration , etc .",
    "recently , _ zigbee _",
    "standard @xcite has proposed new specifications for the physical and medium access layers and determined an upper bound for the number of _ _ wban__s and sensors that may collocate within a certain communication range .",
    "thus , there is great possibility of inter-_wban _ interference in environments such as hospitals and senior communities , where _ _ wban__s are densely deployed .",
    "consequently , the interference may require multiple retransmissions or even hinder the reception of the data and thus degrade the performance of each individual _ wban _ as whole .",
    "therefore , interference mitigation is quite necessary to avoid repeated transmissions and data loss and hence increase maximum network lifetime as well as reduce the minimum delay and unnecessary communication related energy consumption . to this end , three mechanisms ,",
    "namely , beacon shifting , channel hopping and active superframe interleaving are proposed for _ _ wban__s interference mitigation in _ zigbee _ standard @xcite .",
    "in addition , the co - channel interference is challenging due to the highly mobile and resource constrained nature of _ _ wban__s*/. the uncontrolled motion pattern and the independent operation of _ wban _ make the interference mitigation by a centralized unit as well as the application of advanced communication and power control techniques used in other wireless networks , unsuitable for _ _ wban__s .",
    "standard @xcite has recommended the use of _ tdma _ medium access scheme as an alternative solution to avoid intra-_wban _ co - channel interference , nonetheless and due to the absence of coordination and synchronization among _ _",
    "wban__s , the different superframes may overlap and the concurrent transmissions of different nearby _ _",
    "wban__s may still interfere . more specifically ,",
    "when two or more sensors of different _",
    "_ wban__s access the shared channel at the same time , their transmissions cause medium access collision .",
    "this paper tackles these issues and contributes the following :    * _ chim , a distributed scheme that enables predictable channel hopping using latin rectangles in order to avoid interference among coexisting _ _",
    "wban__s _ * _ an analysis of the collision probability model for sensors transmissions _",
    "the simulation results and theoretical analysis show that our approach can significantly lower the number of collisions and reduce the delay among the individual transmissions of coexisting _ _ wban__s as well as increase the energy savings at _ sensor_- and _ wban_-levels.*/ the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",

    "avoidance and mitigation of channel interference has been extensively researched in the wireless communication literature . published techniques in the realm of _ wban _ can be categorized as spectrum allocation , cooperative communication , power control and multiple medium access schemes .",
    "example schemes that pursue the spectrum allocation methodology include @xcite .",
    "movassaghi et al . , @xcite have proposed a distributed channel allocation for the sensors belonging to interference regions amongst coexisting _ _",
    "whereas , in @xcite , an adaptive scheme that allocates synchronous and parallel transmission intervals has been proposed for _",

    "wban__s , where variations in channel assignment due to _ wban _ mobility scenarios are investigated .",
    "further , the scheme is optimized to allocate transmission time - slots with synchronous and parallel transmissions such that the interference is avoided and hence and to reduce the number of interfering sensors is reduced.*/    * / meanwhile , dong et al .",
    ", @xcite have adopted cooperative communication integrated with transmit power control for multiple coexisting _ _ wban__s .",
    "similarly , ali et al . ,",
    "@xcite , have proposed a distributed , carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance scheme that enables interference - free sensors to transmit through a priori - agreed upon channel .",
    "whilst , interfering sensors may double their contention windows or use a switched channel to avoid intra-_wban _ interference*/ whereas , zou et al .",
    ", @xcite have proposed a _",
    "game based power control approach to mitigate the impact of inter-_wban _ interference .",
    "other approaches have pursued multiple medium access schemes for interference mitigation .",
    "kim et al . , @xcite have pursued multiple medium access schemes and proposed a distributed _ tdma_-based beacon interval shifting scheme for avoiding the overlap between superframe s active period through employing carrier sense before a beacon transmission .",
    "similarly , chen et al .",
    ", @xcite have adopted _ tdma _ for scheduling intra-_wban _ transmissions and carrier sensing to deal with inter-_wban _ interference .",
    "meanwhile the approach of @xcite has mapped the channel allocation as a graph coloring problem .",
    "the coordinators need to exchange messages to achieve a non - conflict coloring in a distributed manner .",
    "whilst , ju et al .",
    ", @xcite have proposed a multi - channel topology - transparent algorithm based on latin squares for transmissions scheduling in multihop packet radio networks .",
    "thus , in a multi - channel _ tdma_-based network , each node is equipped with a single transmitter and multiple receivers .",
    "like @xcite , _ chim _ employs latin rectangles to form a predictable non - interfering transmission schedule .",
    "however , _ chim _ considers the presence of single receiver rather than multiple receivers per a single node and single hop rather than multihop communication .",
    "in addition , _ chim _ avoids frequent channel switching by limiting it to the case when a sensor interference occurs .    unlike prior work , in this paper we exploit the _ 16 _ channels available in the _ 2.4 ghz",
    "_ international band of _ zigbee _ , and propose a distributed scheme based on predictable channel hopping for interference avoidance amongst coexisting _ _ wban__s . at the network setup",
    ", each individual _ wban _ autonomously picks a latin rectangle*/ through which each sensor is allocated a backup time - slot and channel to use if it experiences interference .",
    "we depend on the special properties of latin rectangles to minimize the probability of both time and channel matching among sensors in different _",
    "_ wban__s , and consequently reduce the transmission delay and energy consumption .",
    "we consider _ n _ _ tdma_-based _ _ wban__s that coexist in an operation area , e.g. , * /a large hall of a hospital . each _ wban _ consists of a single coordinator denoted by _ crd _ and up to _ k _ sensors , each transmits its data at maximum rate of _",
    "250kb / s _ within the _ 2.4 ghz _ international band ( _ ism _ ) . furthermore , we assume all coordinators are equipped with significantly richer energy supply than sensors and all sensors have access to all _ zigbee _ channels at any time .",

    ", we exploit the _ 16 channels _ in the _ 2.4 ghz _",
    "_ ism _ band of _ zigbee _ to resolve this problem through predicatable channel hopping .",
    "however , to avoid the delay and energy overhead due to frequent change in channels , our approach enables hopping only at the level of the interfering sensors .      in this section ,",
    "we provide a brief overview of latin squares that we used to allocate interference mitigation channels .    a latin",
    "square is a @xmath0 matrix , filled with _",
    "k _ distinct symbols , each symbol appearing once in each column and once in each row .    [ orthogonal ] two distinct @xmath0 latin squares _ e = ( @xmath1 ) _ and _ f = ( @xmath2 ) _ , so that @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 , are said to be orthogonal , if the @xmath5 ordered pairs ( @xmath6 ) are all different from each other . more generally , the set _",
    "@xmath7 _ of distinct latin squares _",
    "is said to be orthogonal , if every pair in _ o _ is orthogonal .",
    "an orthogonal set of latin squares of order _ k _ is of size _ ( k-1 ) _ ,",
    "i.e. , the number of latin squares in the orthogonal family is _ ( k-1 ) _ , is called a complete set @xcite .",
    "a @xmath8 latin rectangle is a @xmath8 matrix _",
    "g _ , filled with symbols @xmath9 @xmath3 @xmath10 , such that each row and each column contains only distinct symbols .    [ theo1 ] if there is an orthogonal family of _ r _ latin squares of order _ k",
    "_ , then _ @xmath11 _",
    "@xcite    _ e _ and _ f _ are orthogonal latin squares of order _ 3 _ , because no two ordered pairs within _",
    "e@xmath12 f _ are similar .",
    "@size8@mathfonts    @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15    basically , if a _ wban",
    "_ picks one latin square from an orthogonal set , there will be no shared channel among the coexisting latins . according to _ *",
    "theorem [ theo1 ] * _ , the number of _",
    "_ wban__s using orthogonal latin squares is upper bounded by _",
    "k _ should be large enough so that , each _ wban _ can pick an orthogonal latin square with high probability .",
    "the latin square size will depend on the largest among the number of channels , denoted by _",
    "m _ , and number of sensors in each _ wban _ , denoted by _ k_. the _ zigbee _ standard @xcite limits the number of channels which constitutes the rows in the latin square to _ 16 _ , no more than _ 16 _ transmissions can be scheduled . to overcome such a limitation , _ chim _ employs latin rectangles instead , i.e. , does not restrict the value of _ k _ and hence supports _",
    "@xmath16_.    throughout this paper , we denote a symbol by the ordered pair _",
    "( i , j ) _ referenced at the @xmath17 row and @xmath18 column in the latin rectangle , which refers to the assignment of @xmath17 interference mitigation backup channel , denoted by _ bkc _ , to the @xmath18 sensor in the dedicated backup time - slot , denoted by _",
    "bkts_. in addition , _ c _ and _ dfc _ , respectively , denote a channel and default operation channel .",
    "as pointed out , a co - channel interference takes place if the simultaneous transmissions of sensors and coordinators in different _ _ wban__s collide .",
    "the potential for such a collision problem grows with the increase in the communication range and the density of sensors in the individual _ _ wban__s . to mitigate interference ,",
    "_ chim _ exploits the availability of multiple channels to assign each _ wban _ a distinct default channel and in case of interference it allows the individual sensors to hop among the remaining channels in a pattern that is predictable within a _ wban _ and random to the other coexisting _ _ wban__s . to achieve that , _ chim _",
    "extends the size of the superframe through the addition of extra interference mitigation backup time - slots and employs latin rectangles as the underlying scheme for channel allocation to sensors .",
    "_ chim _ relies on the properties of latin rectangles in order to reduce the probability of collision while enabling autonomous scheduling of the medium access .",
    "we consider beacon - enabled _ _",
    "wban__s , where each superframe is delimited by two beacons and composed of two successive frames : ( i ) active , that is dedicated for sensors , and ( ii ) inactive , that is designated for coordinators . the active frame",
    "is further divided into two parts of equal size , the time division multiple access ( _ tdma _ ) data - collection part and the interference mitigation backup ( _ imb _ ) interference mitigation part , each is of _ k _ time - slots length .",
    "* figure [ superframestruct ] * shows the superframe structure .",
    "in the _ tdma _ part , each sensor transmits its data packet in its assigned time - slot to the coordinator through the default channel .",
    "however , in the _ imb _ interference mitigation part , each interfering sensor retransmits the same data packet in its allocated backup time - slot to the coordinator through a priori - agreed upon channel . in interference - free conditions , the coordinator stays tuned to the default channel .",
    "if communication with a specific sensor @xmath19 fails during @xmath19 s designated time - slot , the coordinator will tune to the @xmath19 s backup channel during @xmath19 s time - slot in the _ imb _ interference mitigation part of the active frame .",
    "whereas , during the inactive frame , all the sensors sleep and hence , the coordinators may transmit all data to a command center .    we still need to determine the length of each frame . * / in fact , the size of the _ tdma _ data collection part depends on two factors , 1 ) how big the time - slot , which is based on the protocol in use , and 2 ) the number of required time - slots , which is determined by the different sampling rates of _ wban _ sensors .",
    "generally , the sum of number of samples for all sensors in a time period determines the _ tdma _ data collection part size .",
    "however , _",
    "chim _ requires the _ tdma _ data collection part for all wbans to be the same length so that collision could be better avoided by unifying the frame size across the various _ wban _ and leveraging the properties of latin rectangles.*/ whereas , the inactive frame directly follows the active frame ( _ tdma _ part and the _ imb _ part ) and whose length depends on the underlying duty cycle scheme of the sensors .      in _ _",
    "wban__s , data may be lost due to the co - channel interference , and hence acknowledgments are required to assure the transmitters the successful reception .",
    "time - outs are used to detect reception failure at the corresponding receivers .",
    "we note that collisions may take place at the level of data or acknowledgement packets as shown in * figure [ collision ] * and explained below .",
    "data packet collisions take place at the coordinator when a sensor @xmath20 of @xmath21 transmits while another sensor or coordinator of another @xmath22 transmit on the same channel that @xmath20 uses , i.e. , under the following condition : coordinator of @xmath21 is in range of @xmath23 or @xmath24 of @xmath22 , and @xmath23 or @xmath24 transmits on the same channel used by sensor @xmath20 .",
    "in essence such collision may be experienced in two scenarios : ( i ) @xmath25 ; i.e. , both @xmath21 and @xmath22 happen to pick the same channel for intra-_wban _ communication , in which case @xmath24 or @xmath23 could be sending a data or acknowledgement packets , respectively .",
    "( ii ) either @xmath26 = @xmath27 or @xmath28 ; i.e. , the channel has been picked by @xmath21 is equal to the same channel that has been allocated to sensor @xmath24 of @xmath22 in its backup time - slot within the _ imb _ interference mitigation part .",
    "acknowledgment packet collisions take place at the sensor when a sensor @xmath20 of @xmath21 receives while another sensor or coordinator of another @xmath22 transmit on the same channel that @xmath20 uses , i.e. , under the following condition : @xmath20 is in range of @xmath23 or @xmath24 of @xmath22 , and @xmath23 or @xmath24 transmits on the same channel used by sensor @xmath20 .",
    "similarly , the same condition of collision scenarios that are inferred by in data packets collision section still holds , i.e. , ( i ) @xmath25 and , ( ii ) @xmath26 = @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "we argue that this case will be avoided by approach as explained later .      at the network setup time , each _ wban _ s coordinator will randomly pick a _ default operation channel _ and a _",
    "@xmath8 latin rectangle _ from an orthogonal set .",
    "initially , the coordinator instructs all sensors within its _ wban _ to use the same _ default channel _ along the whole _",
    "tdma _ part .",
    "meantime , the coordinator assigns a _ single symbol _ from the symbol set _",
    "\\{1,2,  ,k } _ to each sensor within its _ wban _ , where the position hopping of each symbol in the latin rectangle relates a _ single interference mitigation channel _ and a _ unique backup time - slot_. thereby , each coordinator determines the combination of a _ single interference mitigation channel _ and a _ unique backup time - slot _ for each sensor to eventually use in the _ imb _ part for interference mitigation .",
    "subsequently , a coordinator informs each sensor within its _ wban _ about its allocated : 1 ) _ interference mitigation channel _ and , 2 ) _ backup time - slot _ within the _ imb _ part of the superframe .",
    "each coordinator reports this information to its sensors through beacon broadcast .",
    "_ chim _ depends on both acknowledgment and timeouts to detect collision / interference at both _",
    "sensor- _ and _ coordinator- _ levels . in the _ tdma _ active part of a superframe",
    ", each sensor transmits a data packet in its assigned time - slot to the coordinator on the default operation channel , it sets a timeout timer and waits for an acknowledgment packet .",
    "thus , if it successfully receives the acknowledgment packet from the corresponding coordinator , it considers the transmission successful , and hence it sleeps until the next superframe .",
    "in this case , the transmitting sensor does not need to switch to its allocated interference mitigation channel and use its dedicated backup time - slot in the _ imb _ part for interference mitigation .",
    "however , if the transmitting sensor does not successfully receive the acknowledgmenet within the time - out period , it assumes failed transmission due to interference and subsequently , it applies the interference mitigation procedure .",
    "basically , the sensor waits until the _ tdma _ active part completes and then swtiches its channel to the allocated interference mitigation channel at the beginning of its allocated backup time - slot and retransmits its data packet .",
    "in fact , this failure is due to data or acknowledgment packets collisions at the _ coordinator- _ or _",
    "_ sensor-__levels , respectively , i.e. , 1 ) the desired transmitted data packet is lost at the coordinator due to its interference from sensors in other _ _",
    "wban__s at the same time or , 2 ) the acknowledgment packet of the desired coordinator is lost at the desired sensor due to the same reason .",

    "_ wban__s .",
    "i.e. , they do not share the same symbol positions , each in its own latin rectangle and consequently , no other _ wban _ in the network would simultaneously share the same pattern with @xmath33 all the time .",

    "* algorithm [ chim ] * provides a summary of _ chim_.",
    "in this section we opt to analytically assess the effectiveness of _ chim _ in terms of reducing the probability of collisions .      in this section ,",
