    "the vicsek model @xcite has received particular attention due to its simplicity and the universality of its qualitative features .",
    "this model is a discrete particle model which consists of a time - discretized set of ordinary differential equations for the particle position and velocities .",
    "the velocities are assumed to be of constant norm and updated according to an alignment rule , i.e. each agent tries to align its velocity to that of its neighbors in some sensing region .",

    "a time - continuous version of this model and its kinetic formulation are available in @xcite . from the the time - continuous vicsek model to this kinetic model",
    "is rigorously justified in @xcite .    in @xcite , degond - motsch derived formally the hydrodynamic limit of the time - continuous vicsek model through an asymptotic analysis of its kinetic version @xcite .",
    "the resulting model is a system of balanced equations for the density and mean velocity orientation ( or polarization vector ) .",
    "this model was later called the self - organized hydrodynamics ( soh ) . furthermore ,",
    "in @xcite , degond - liu - motsch - panferov derived the modifications of the soh model by the introduction of the attraction - repulsion force , different scaling assumptions about the size of the sensing region which involve a higher level of non - locality . as proved in @xcite , the strict combination of alignment and noise results in the appearance of a pressure term in the soh model . introducing an attraction - repulsion force and spanning various scaling assumptions on this force and on the size of the sensing region , they obtain in @xcite a variety of effects that are not encompassed in @xcite .    in @xcite , besides the derivation of the macroscopic equations , they prove a local - in - time existence theorem in the 2d case for the viscous model ( when the non - local effects are retained ) and in the 3d case for the inviscid case ( when the non - local effects are omitted ) . both proofs",
    "are based on a suitable symmetrization of the system and on the energy method .",
    "the main concern of the current paper is on the rigorous justification of the hydrodynamic limit from the self - organized kinetic ( sok ) system to the self - organized hydrodynamics ( soh ) .",
    "the main challenge is the lack of conservation laws . to overcome this difficulty , the generalized collision invariants ( gci ) are employed to derive the macroscopic equations .",
    "we start from the solution constructed in @xcite and proved that there exists a class of the solutions of sok uniformly on a time interval on which the solutions of the soh are constructed , such that their hydrodynamic limits are the soh .",

    "the equation is a fokker - planck equation .",
    "the left - hand side expresses the rate of change of @xmath27 due to the spatial transport of the particle with velocity @xmath28 while the first term at the right - hand side denotes the transport in velocity space due to the interaction force @xmath29 .",
    "the last term at the right - hand side is a velocity diffusion term which arises as a consequence of the brownian noise in particle velocities .",
