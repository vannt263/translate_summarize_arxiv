    "it has recently become clear that ultracold atom - photon systems offer intriguing opportunities to synthesize a new class of `` soft '' photonic quantum materials such as for example glasses @xcite and liquid crystals @xcite in optical cavities as well as `` granular '' media made of rydberg polaritons interacting via hard rod potentials @xcite .",
    "historically , quantum effects on prototypical soft and granular materials such as sand , polymers , or foams have not been investigated much because they are too large and too heavy and therefore outside the quantum regime .",
    "however , already on a classical level , the response of certain soft materials is remarkably rich : granular media at vanishing external pressure or random polymer networks with loose connectivity , for example , exhibit large deformations in response to applied mechanical perturbations . in both cases",
    ", there is a geometrical or topological control parameter that determines the magnitude of the elastic moduli : the average overlap between grains or the mean coordination number of the network . by tuning these parameters one can reach a fragile , mechanical state characterized by a vanishing linear response @xcite , often termed sonic vacuum since the linear speed of sound vanishes @xcite . in these fragile states ,",
    "even the tiniest strains propagate as supersonic solitons ( or shocks ) rather than ordinary phonons .    in this paper , we propose a new quantum soft matter phase in the fragile regime .",
    "extending the line of work on quantum simulation with phonons @xcite and structural , `` zigzag '' quantum phase transitions in ion chains @xcite , we here consider the quantum phase transition from a one - dimensional solid of ions to a dissipative state with broken @xmath0-symmetry induced by a reggeon - type cubic nonlinearity coupling neighboring ions . as in the known soft counterparts ,",
    "the mechanical response ( the quadratic term in their hamiltonian ) of our model can become vanishingly small such that the response is predominantly nonlinear ; on top of that , the mechanical properties are strongly affected by zero point fluctuations leading to a quantum phase transition in the reggeon universality class @xcite .",
    "the main physical result of our analysis is that the basic excitations at the quantum critical point of the reggeon ion chain ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diag ] ) are neither ordinary phonons , that can not exist because of the vanishing ( transverse ) rigidity , nor the strongly non - linear solitons that characterize similar critical points in the absence of fluctuations . instead , quantum fluctuations give rise to mechanical excitations with a non - linear dispersion relation .",
    "this can be traced to the emergence of a length - scale dependent propagation velocity of transverse waves ( or equivalently elastic modulus ) .    using the renormalization group to one - loop order",
    ", we can actually flow into the highly nonlinear regime close to the quantum critical point , where violent fluctuations of the ion displacements lead to reggeon - type quantum criticality that is neither luttinger liquid - like nor part of the @xmath1-dimensional ising universality class of the zigzag transition @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the presence of a continuous symmetry in combination with unitarity inevitably leads to luttinger liquid behavior of conventional gapless quantum liquids in one dimension @xcite . both of these constraints are relaxed in the highly non - linear regime of the non - unitary quantum chain .",
    "this is the reason why the imaginary cubic nonlinearity acts as a relevant perturbation to the luttinger liquid behavior and leads to an unusual power - law scaling of correlators .    at the quantum critical point ,",
    "when the chain becomes fragile , the low - energy , low - momentum , mechanical excitations disperse at low as @xmath2 signaling a strongly momentum - dependent propagation velocity ( recall that for conventional phonons @xmath3 ) .",
    "the associated spectral function becomes dissipative and displays a quantum critical continuum that may associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath0-symmetry .",
    "we propose to associate this new quantum critical point with the notion of quantum fragility generalizing the physics known from soft materials to the quantum regime . in the phase with",
    "broken @xmath0 symmetry , some of the energy eigenvalues @xcite , as well as potentially some of the mechanical response functions , can become complex - valued . as in ref .",
