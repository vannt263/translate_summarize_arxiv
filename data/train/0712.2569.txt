    "more than 250 exoplanets are now known , and their orbital characteristics are remarkably diverse . in particular , the surprising discoveries of close - in giant planets and planets on highly eccentric orbits have led to interesting revisions of planet formation theory .",
    "it is generally believed that the close - in giant planets originally formed at larger orbital distances ( beyond the `` snow line '' ) and migrated inward during the planet formation epoch @xcite .",
    "one possible migration mechanism is tidal interaction with the protoplanetary gas disk , after the planet opens up a gap in the disk ( type ii migration ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which is appealing because it can account for the observed period distribution ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . however , some planets have large eccentricities despite their close - in orbits , such as hat - p-2b @xcite , gj  436b @xcite , and hd  17156b @xcite .",
    "since disk - planet interaction would not excite a planet s eccentricity to such a level @xcite , the scenario does not provide an obvious explanation for these systems . on the other hand",
    ", some other migration models would naturally produce eccentric orbits , namely , planet - planet gravitational scattering ( @xcite ; nagasawa et al .",
    "2008 ) . in these models",
    ", planets would initially obtain very large eccentricities and small periastron distances through the gravitational interactions , and subsequently evolve into shorter - period and more circular orbits through tidal dissipation .    assuming that planets are initially formed on circular orbits , the observation of highly eccentric orbits is already an indication of previous gravitational interactions .",
    "what other type of evidence might establish the case for such interactions ?",
    "recently , the alignment angle of the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbital axis ( the spin - orbit alignment angle ) has become recognized to be a promising diagnostic .",
    "this is because disk - planet interaction would probably maintain the original spin - orbit alignment , while planet - planet scattering would cause significant misalignments in a nontrivial fraction of cases ( e.g. , @xcite ; nagasawa et al .",
    "2008 ) . because the damping time scale of the spin - orbit alignment angle is expected to be longer ( by a few orders of magnitude ) than that of eccentricity",
    ", one might regard the spin - orbit angle as a fossil record of planetary migration .",
    "it is possible to measure the sky - projection of the spin - orbit alignment angle , @xmath1 , for a transiting exoplanet , by making use of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect ( hereafter the rm effect : @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the rm effect is the radial velocity ( rv ) anomaly caused by the partial occultation of the rotating stellar surface ( see @xcite , @xcite for theoretical descriptions ) , and several observers have reported the detections of the rm effect and measured @xmath1 in transiting planetary systems .",
    "however , the reported angles for the spin - orbit alignment were either small or consistent with zero , even for the highly eccentric case of hat - p-2b @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we present a photometric and spectroscopic study of a recent transit of hd  17156b @xcite .",
    "this planet has a large orbital eccentricity and a small periastron distance , and is therefore a promising candidate for a spin - orbit misalignment .",
    "the system has also attracted considerable interest because it has by far the longest period ( 21 days ) of any known transiting exoplanet .",
    "we describe our observations in section 2 and our results in section 3 .",
    "the final section is a summary and a discussion of the results .",
    "we observed a transit of hd  17156b on ut 2007 november 12 , both spectroscopically and photometrically , with telescopes in the okayama prefecture of japan .",
    "the transit was predicted to occur in the later part of that night , according to ephemerides kindly provided by d.  charbonneau ( 2007 , private communication ) .",
    "the photometric transit was observed with a 20  cm meade telescope at kurashiki - shi .",
    "the spectroscopic transit was observed with the 188  cm telescope at the okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) .",
    "we observed hd  17156 for a 5  hr period spanning the transit time , with both telescopes , through air masses ranging from 1.3 to 1.6 .",
    "the photometric observations were conducted at kurashiki - shi ( e , n , h=7 m ) using a 20  cm meade lx200r-20 @xmath2 telescope . a cooled ( 253  k )",
    "st-9xe ccd camera provides a @xmath3 arcmin@xmath4 field of view with the pixel scale of 2.06 arcsec .",
    "we defocused the stellar images in order to average over pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations , and to draw out the exposure time and thereby increase the duty cycle .",
    "the exposure time was 60  s and the readout time was 1  s. we observed through a rc band filter covering the range 57206780   .",
    "we used the astronomical image processing for windows software ( aip4win ver.2.1.10 ) for the subtraction of dark current , flat - fielding , and aperture photometry .",
    "we determined the apparent magnitudes of hd  17156 ( @xmath5 ) and two comparison stars : hd  16906 ( @xmath6 ) and bd+71  168 ( @xmath7 ) using an aperture radius of 20 pixels .",
    "the typical fwhm of each star ranged from 18 to 21 pixels ( from 37 to 43 arcsec ) .",
    "we estimated the sky background level with an annulus from 27 to 32 pixels in radius centered on each star , and subtracted the estimated sky contribution from the aperture flux .",
    "then we computed the differential magnitude between hd  17156 and the ensemble average of the comparison stars .",
    "after these steps , we clearly detected the transit event .",
    "we also found small linear trend in the out - of - transit ( oot ) data ; we removed the trend by fitting the oot data with a linear function of time .",
    "( 45mm,45mm)figure1.eps    we estimated photometric errors of our samples as follows .",
    "we first calculated the poisson noise of each sample and found that the scatter for the oot data is systematically larger than the poisson error . in order to account for the systematic errors in the photometry , we scaled the poisson estimates of the errors to satisfy @xmath8 for the oot dataset .",
    "next , we also considered the time - correlated noise ( the so - called `` red noise '' , see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we compared the standard deviation of each oot sample ( @xmath9 ) with the standard deviation of the oot data after averaging each @xmath10 points ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we found that @xmath12 for values of @xmath10 ranging from 10 to 60 , suggesting that the effects of correlated noise are small in this case .",
    "thus we did not modify the error bars further .",
    "the typical photometric error is about 4 mmag .",
    "our light curve is shown in the top panel of figure  [ ourdata ] .",
    "we used the high dispersion echelle spectrograph ( hides ; @xcite ) on the 188  cm telescope at oao .",
    "we employed the standard setup for rv measurements with the iodine absorption cell ( covering the wavelength range 50006200   , where the iodine absorption lines are abundant ) .",
    "the slit width of 280 @xmath13 m ( @xmath14 ) yielded a spectral resolution of @xmath1545000 , and the seeing was between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "for the transit event of ut  2007  november  12 , we used 15  min exposures with a binnning of 4 ( spatial ) @xmath18 1 ( dispersion ) .",
    "we also obtained a few spectra on ut  2007 november 14 , 17 , and 18 , outside of transits , in order to refine the spectroscopic orbit . for these oot spectra we used 30  min exposures and 1 @xmath18 1 binning .",
    "the typical signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) was 50 - 80 pixel@xmath19 .",
    "we processed the frames with standard iraf procedures and extracted one - dimensional spectra .",
    "we then calculated relative rv variations by the algorithm following @xcite .",
    "we estimated internal errors of the radial velocities from the scatter of the rv solutions for 4 - 5    segments of the spectra .",

    "as described in the previous section , we have obtained 25 rv samples and 251 rc band photometric samples covering the transit .",
    "in addition , in order to determine an optimal solution of orbital parameters for hd  17156 , we incorporate previously published radial velocity data taken at the subaru telescope and the keck  i telescope ( 9 from subaru and 24 from keck : @xcite ) .",

    "in this letter , we have presented the results of simultaneous spectroscopy and photometry of a transit of hd  17156b , which was reported to have an eccentric orbit .",
    "( the high eccentricity is indeed confirmed by our radial velocity data around and after the transit phase . )",
    "we have measured the sky - projected spin - orbit alignment angle @xmath1 by modeling the rossiter - mclaughlin effect , and found @xmath76 .",
    "although the statistical significance is modest , this result suggests that hd  17156b has a large spin - orbit angle .",
    "one may wonder whether the values @xmath121 and @xmath122 are physically possible and consistent with theoretical predictions . considering that the periastron distance @xmath123 for hd  17156b is @xmath124 au , where @xmath43 is the semimajor axis and @xmath56 is the eccentricity , and assuming a planetary tidal quality factor of @xmath125 , then the damping timescale for the eccentricity due to dynamic tides in the planet is typically longer than @xmath126 [ gyr ] ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , tidal circularization is expected to be incomplete at its stellar age ( @xmath127 [ gyr ] : @xcite ) .",
    "there is another possibility that the planet initially obtained larger eccentricity and more close - in periastron distance ( say , @xmath128 and @xmath129 [ a.u . ] ) and evolved to the current orbit ( nagasawa et al .",
    "2008 ) . in this case",
    ", the planet would be still in the evolutionary track toward a hot jupiter .",
    "on the other hand , the damping of the spin - orbit angle is mainly caused by tidal dissipation inside the host star , rather than the planet .",
    "assuming a stellar tidal quality factor of @xmath130 as a typical value , the damping timescale of the spin - orbit alignment is estimated to be longer than @xmath131 [ yr ] ( see e.g. , eq .",
    "( 15 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the tidal quality factors for the star and the planet are still unknown and the damping timescales estimated above remain fairly uncertain . in particular , it is possible that the coplanarization timescale is shorter than we have calculated , if only a thin outer convective layer is reoriented .",
    "however , our simple considerations show that it is at least physically plausible for the planet to have maintained a large eccentricity and a large spin - orbit angle since the planet formation epoch . moreover , very recently several theoretical simulations predicted that certain degree of planetary systems migrated through the planet - planet interactions would have a large eccentricity and also a large spin - orbit misalignment ( @xcite ; nagasawa et al .",
    "our results are thus consistent in principle with the predictions from these recent theoretical works .    finally , we note that this planet is the first plausible candidate to have a large spin - orbit misalignment .",
    "further rv measurements are highly desired to bolster the precision in the determination of @xmath1 .",
    "such observations are perfectly feasible with a larger telescope than the 1.9  m telescope we employed ; the main difficulty is the rarity of follow - up opportunities from a given observatory , due to the long orbital period . given the present results , we believe this system and its transits are worthy of further photometric and spectroscopic scrutiny .",
    "we are very grateful to yuuki moritani , akira imada , daisaku nogami , and members of okayama planet search project for kindly exchanging oao / hides observing time .",
