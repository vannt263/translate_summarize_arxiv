    "over approximately the last sixty years , numerous models and techniques have been developed for creating equations of state ( eos ) for a variety of materials that are valid up to very extreme pressures ( tens of mbar ) and temperatures ( several ev ) . in the eos community at the national laboratories , for instance",
    ", we have often used models based on the mie - grneisen eos together with the thomas - fermi or thomas - fermi - dirac model ( or one of its modifications ) to include the contributions from the electrons ( see @xcite for examples ) .",
    "the models usually contain enough independent parameters to adjust the eos until it correctly reproduces the experimentally measured hugoniot ( and perhaps a few other data points ) , but it is generally an open question how accurate the eos is away from the hugoniot . in this paper",
    "we argue that for one class of materials , elemental solids and liquids , our understanding of the underlying condensed matter hamiltonian for the nuclei and electrons has grown to the point that we can construct highly accurate eos from essentially first principles , and we also propose a means for doing so .",
    "we also argue that , since the underlying physics is well understood , an eos derived this way should have the right functional form , even if we are unsure of the values of some of its parameters ; thus , if the resulting eos is shown to be accurate in one thermodynamic region ( say , along the hugoniot ) , then we can be confident that it is roughly equally accurate elsewhere .    in this formalism ,",
    "the eos in the solid phase depends on a decomposition of the hamiltonian due to wallace ( see chapter 1 of @xcite ) , extending the work of born @xcite to metals as well as insulators ; the resulting free energy contains terms describing the harmonic motion of the nuclei about their lattice sites ( phonons ) , thermal excitation of the electrons from their ground state , anharmonic corrections to the nuclear motion ( represented as phonon - phonon interactions ) , and interactions between the electron excitations and the nuclear motion , represented as electron - phonon interactions .",
    "( please note that this description is exact ; all of the physics contained in the true hamiltonian of the system is included here .",
    "specific eos models usually neglect the anharmonic and electron - phonon terms , arguing that anharmonicity is small and making reference to some form of the born - oppenheimer approximation ; we will take a somewhat different route , commenting on approximations below . ) a recently developed theory of the dynamics of monatomic liquids ( see @xcite for a review ) uses the same hamiltonian to derive a liquid free energy which is quite similar to the expression for a solid , with additional terms accounting for the fact that the liquid , as opposed to the solid , traverses many potential valleys and thus sees the boundaries between them . for both phases ,",
    "the resulting free energies have been compared with experimental data in the low - pressure regime ( @xmath0 kbar ) , with the following results ( sections 17 - 19 and 23 of @xcite ) :    \\(a ) molecular dynamics ( md ) calculations of the anharmonic contribution to the entropy of several solids match experimental entropy data to the accuracy of the data themselves .",
    "\\(b ) low - temperature ( @xmath1 k ) calculations of the electron - phonon term for several solids lead to predictions that also match experimental entropy to the accuracy of the data .",
    "\\(c ) theoretical arguments show that the electron - phonon contribution is entirely negligible except when the electronic contribution dominates the free energy , such as in metallic solids at low temperatures .",
    "\\(d ) for the 27 elemental solids for which accurate data are available from low @xmath2 ( but not too low ; see point ( c ) ) to the melting temperature @xmath3 , the free energy excluding the anharmonic and electron - phonon terms accounts for the experimental thermal energy and entropy to an accuracy of @xmath4 ( in fact , an accuracy of @xmath5 for all but about five materials ) .",
    "\\(e ) for the 6 elements in the liquid phase for which accurate data are available at temperatures up to around @xmath6 , the effect of neglecting the anharmonic , boundary , and electron - phonon contributions to the energy and entropy is similarly small .",
    "this tells us that at low pressures , we can neglect the anharmonic , boundary , and electron - phonon terms in both the solid and liquid free energy ( which happen to be the hardest terms to calculate ) , and the resulting thermal energy and entropy are both simple in form and accurate at the @xmath4 level .",
    "it is for this reason , not an appeal to the born - oppenheimer or other approximations , that we know we can simplify our eos and what the results of the simplification will be , at least at low pressures .    in this paper",
    "we do two things : ( 1 ) we describe in more detail this framework for constructing eos and discuss the theoretical and experimental inputs needed to implement it , and ( 2 ) we construct a sample eos , neglecting anharmonic , boundary , and electron - phonon terms , both to illustrate the method and to discover whether points ( d ) and ( e ) above continue to hold in the high - pressure regime .",
    "we use aluminum as our sample because of the availability of extensive electronic structure calculations , up to a compression of three , and highly accurate shock hugoniot data , which provide a test of our eos through both phases to pressures of around 5 mbar . in subsection",
    "[ solid ] we develop the general theory of the solid eos , and in subsection [ liquid ] we do the same for the liquid . in subsection",
    "[ constructing ] , we construct our sample eos for al , comparing it with other eos work , and in subsection [ hug ] we compute the hugoniot predicted by the eos and compare it with experimental data .",
    "the results are encouraging .",
    "finally , we review our work , discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this formalism ( and how to address the disadvantages ) , and suggest directions for future development .",
    "the condensed matter hamiltonian , decomposed as described above , consists of terms describing the motion of the nuclei in a potential generated by the electrons in their ground state , plus additional terms that lead to the thermal excitation of the electrons and describe their interactions with the nuclear motion . with this hamiltonian",
    ", the helmholtz free energy per atom for a solid at temperature @xmath2 with volume @xmath7 per atom takes the form @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the static lattice potential ( the electronic ground state energy when the nuclei are fixed at their lattice sites ) ; it depends on the particular crystal structure .",
    "@xmath10 is the contribution from the harmonic motion of the nuclei about their lattice sites , @xmath11 represents the thermal excitation of the electrons when the nuclei are fixed at their lattice sites , @xmath12 accounts for the anharmonicity of the nuclear motion ( which may be represented as phonon - phonon interactions ) , and @xmath13 expresses the interactions between the electron excitations and the nuclear motion , represented as electron - phonon interactions .",
    "( we emphasize again that this free energy is exact ; it includes all of the physics present in the hamiltonian . )",
    "the discussion in the introduction justifies our approximating the solid free energy as @xmath14 so let us now consider the forms of @xmath10 and @xmath15 and the parameters on which they depend .",
    "the phonon term in the hamiltonian describes harmonic motion , which leads uniquely to the free energy of lattice dynamics : @xmath16 d\\omega , \\label{flatt}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the distribution of phonon frequencies in the brillouin zone .",
    "( note that @xmath19 is volume dependent . )",
    "sometimes we require not the full eq .",
    "( [ flatt ] ) but only its high- and low - temperature limits , for which we need not the full @xmath18 but only three of its moments , expressed in terms of the characteristic temperatures @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 defined by @xmath23^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 indicates an average over all the frequencies in the brillouin zone .",
    "then the following limits hold : @xmath25 and @xmath26                  { \\rm \\ \\ at \\ high \\ } t. \\label{flatthight}\\ ] ] the leading term in eq .",
    "( [ flatthight ] ) describes purely classical nuclear motion , while the series of terms in powers of @xmath27 are quantum corrections . keeping only the first quantum correction , the thermodynamic functions derived from eq .",
    "( [ flatthight ] ) are accurate to @xmath28 at temperatures above @xmath29 .    the electronic excitation free energy @xmath11 can be expressed generally as an integral function of the electronic density of states per atom , @xmath30 , and the fermi distribution @xmath31 where @xmath32 is still @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the chemical potential .",
    "if each atom contributes @xmath35 electrons to the valence bands ( notice that @xmath35 is not necessarily the atomic number ) , with the lowest valence energy set to zero , then @xmath34 is a function of @xmath2 determined by the normalization condition @xmath36 the electronic free energy is then @xmath37\\ ,       d\\epsilon , \\label{felgen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 , the fermi energy , is the value of @xmath34 when @xmath39 .",
    "the second term on the right hand side of eq .  ( [ felgen ] ) is the subtraction of the electronic ground state energy , which ensures that @xmath40 as @xmath41 .",
    "this property makes sense if @xmath11 represents purely thermal excitation of the electrons .",
    "( it also avoids double counting of the energy , as the electronic ground state energy is already represented as @xmath9 . )",
    "we see from this discussion that to evaluate the terms in eq.([realfs ] ) for the solid free energy we require three unknown functions : @xmath9 , @xmath18 ( or @xmath42 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 if we are concerned only with the high- and low-@xmath2 limits ) , and @xmath30 ( and the associated quantities @xmath35 and @xmath38 ) . these can be determined in various ways :",
    "compressibility data and diamond anvil cell data can be used to construct @xmath43 ; neutron scattering experiments can determine @xmath18 or its various moments at @xmath44 bar ; and for many elements all three of these functions can be computed reliably using electronic structure theory .",
    "( or one could use results from multiple sources in combination , which is often an option with @xmath9 and is basically a necessity with @xmath18 . )",
    "one must keep in mind , however , that the accuracy of one s answers will be limited by the accuracy and range of applicability of these functions , regardless of how they are determined .",
    "according to the theory of liquid dynamics reviewed in @xcite , the same hamiltonian that gave us the solid free energy leads to a similar form for the free energy of a monatomic liquid .",
    "in this theory , the region of the many - body potential surface in which the system moves in the liquid phase is dominated by a large number of intersecting nearly - harmonic valleys , called `` random '' valleys because they correspond to particle configurations which retain no remnant crystal symmetry , and which are all macroscopically identical .",
    "in particular , the valleys all have the same distribution of normal mode frequencies , and they all have the same depth ( which , as in the solid case , is the electronic ground state energy when the nuclei are fixed at the valley minimum ) .",
    "the resulting liquid free energy per atom is @xmath45 all of the terms correspond to their solid counterparts with the following exceptions :    \\(1 ) @xmath46 , now called the static _ structure _ potential , is the depth of a typical valley in which the liquid system moves .",
    "\\(2 ) the normal mode spectrum appearing in @xmath47 is that of a typical liquid potential valley , not the unique solid potential valley .",
    "\\(3 ) the term @xmath48 includes corrections due both to anharmonicity and to the fact that the potential valleys have boundaries , which the liquid ( as opposed to the solid ) encounters as it transits from valley to valley .",
    "\\(4 ) the extra term @xmath49 corresponds to an increase in entropy of @xmath50 per atom ; the value @xmath51 is estimated from entropy of melting data of the elements ( again , see @xcite for details ) . in liquid dynamics",
    "theory , this term is due to the hypothesis that the number of potential valleys among which the liquid moves is of order @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the number of atoms in the system .",
    "we emphasize that the same hamiltonian gives rise to both eq.([fs ] ) and ( [ fl ] ) ; the differences are that the potential is expanded about different equilibrium configurations in the two cases , and that the region of configuration space over which the liquid moves is obviously far larger than the space available to the solid ( hence the @xmath49 term ) .    again making the approximations discussed in the introduction , our form for the liquid free energy",
    "becomes @xmath54 and the additional term @xmath49 is fully determined by setting @xmath55 , as mentioned above .",
    "the form of the phonon term is dictated by a central hypothesis of liquid dynamics theory : the motion of the liquid consists of oscillations in the macroscopically similar valleys described above together with occasional _ transits _ between valleys ; the transits are of such short duration that they do not contribute to the thermodynamics to lowest order",
    ". thus we will take @xmath47 to have the same form as the solid phonon term , eq.([flatt ] ) , with a possibly different phonon frequency distribution @xmath56 .",
    "the electronic excitation term for the solid was derived using only the assumption that the electrons are thermally distributed over the available states using fermi statistics ; all of the information about the configuration of the nuclei is contained in the density of states .",
    "hence @xmath57 also takes the same form as the corresponding solid term , eq .",
    "( [ felgen ] ) , with a density of states @xmath58 appropriate for the liquid phase .",
    "( what this means is discussed briefly below . )    the liquid and solid eos together determine the melting temperature as a function of pressure @xmath59 by the requirement that the solid and liquid gibbs free energies match along the melt curve , or @xmath60 once the melt curve is determined , one can use the solid and liquid eos separately to compute @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the atomic volumes of the solid and liquid at melt as functions of temperature .",
    "( of course , using @xmath59 one can express @xmath63 and @xmath64 as functions of pressure equally well . )    in the case @xmath65 for all @xmath2 , which we assume here , the computation of the full two - phase eos ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 ) for any @xmath7 and @xmath2 proceeds as follows .",
    "if @xmath70 for the given @xmath2 , the system is in the solid phase ; @xmath71 is computed as described in subsection [ solid ] , and the other functions follow from @xmath72 if @xmath73 , the system is in the liquid phase ; @xmath74 is computed as described in this subsection , and the other functions follow from expressions analogous to eqs .",
    "( [ thermfuncs ] ) . if @xmath75 , the system is in the two - phase region ; defining @xmath76 , the volume fraction of the system in the liquid phase , by @xmath77 the thermodynamic functions are @xmath78    finally , we note that just as with the solid , to evaluate the terms in eq .",
    "( [ realfl ] ) we require three unknown functions : @xmath46 , @xmath56 ( or @xmath79 and @xmath80 , since we re not likely to need the low-@xmath2 limit ) , and @xmath58 .",
    "in contrast to the solid case , these functions are generally not available experimentally .",
    "( it is possible that one might be able to compute @xmath46 using liquid compressibility data , but we suspect that this will be very difficult . ) however , for many materials these functions should be computable using electronic structure theory , proceeding much as one would in the solid case except that the nuclei would be arranged not in a crystal configuration but in a disordered structure characteristic of a `` random '' valley in the liquid potential surface @xcite . to our knowledge",
    "very few such calculations have been attempted ; the only ones we are aware of are @xmath46 and @xmath56 at a single volume for liquid sodium in @xcite ( the results are referred to in @xcite and a graph of @xmath56 using their results appears as fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "another function that is sometimes available is the melt curve @xmath59 , but this curve can not be chosen independently of the others , since the solid and liquid eos determine it jointly ; but this can be an advantage , since if @xmath59 is known from experiment , for example , it can be used to compute one of the other needed functions if it is not otherwise available . in fact , this is how we will determine @xmath46 in our example eos , to which we now turn .",
    "to illustrate the application of the theory we ve described , we will now construct an eos for aluminum , which has been the subject of extensive electronic structure calculations and for which a great deal of high - quality experimental data are available .",
    "we will then compare the hugoniot predicted by our eos with data up to pressures of approximately 5 mbar ; this will tell us whether the approximations we discussed in the introduction ( neglecting anharmonic , boundary , and electron - phonon effects ) , known to be accurate at low pressures , continue to be reasonable in the high - pressure domain .",
    "we recall from subsection [ solid ] that the solid eos requires three functions : @xmath9 , @xmath18 , and @xmath81 .",
    "since we will be testing the eos by comparison with hugoniot data , we will always be in the high-@xmath2 region ( except for one brief low-@xmath2 excursion ; see below ) , so we use eq.([flatthight ] ) for @xmath82 instead of eq.([flatt ] ) ; this means that we require only @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 in place of @xmath83 .    to determine these functions , we began by consulting the results of density functional theory ( dft ) calculations carried out in the local density approximation by straub et al .",
    "they worked with fcc and bcc al at atomic volumes from @xmath84 to @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the bohr radius , corresponding to densities from @xmath87 g/@xmath88 to @xmath89 g/@xmath88 ( the density of al at 293 k and 1 bar is @xmath90 g/@xmath88 ) .",
    "their calculations indicate a @xmath39 transition from fcc to bcc at @xmath91 , corresponding to @xmath92 g/@xmath88 , but we will neglect this phase change and treat solid al as an fcc crystal for two reasons : the dft calculations themselves suggest that the effect of the phase change on the thermodynamic functions will be quite small ; and we know from experiment that the solid - liquid transition on the hugoniot takes place well before reaching the density of concern ( see subsection [ hug ] ) , so we are confident of our assumption of fcc along the hugoniot until melting .",
    "however , this assumption may have an effect on the liquid eos at high densities , which we will comment on below .",
    "( other electronic structure work , discussed on pp .",
    "89 - 90 of @xcite , suggests the possibility of an hcp phase between the fcc and bcc phases , but as @xcite also mentions , no experimental signature of this phase has been found , so we will proceed under the assumption of a single solid phase . )",

    "it is also true that in the liquid , @xmath2 is typically much larger than @xmath22 ( for example , in liquid al at normal density @xmath137 ) , rendering the first quantum correction to @xmath47 negligible ( roughly @xmath28 at normal density ) , so even if @xmath80 differs from @xmath22 by @xmath138 or more , the impact on the phonon term will be very small ; therefore we also used the same @xmath139 in the liquid as in the solid .",
    "since the free electron model approximates the dft result for @xmath81 so well for both fcc and bcc al ( figure [ dens ] ) , which correspond to two valleys in the many - body potential surface with rather different structures , we also expect this model to be a good approximation for @xmath58 , the density of states for the structure characteristic of a liquid .",

    "once we had the full solid and liquid eos , we then solved eq.([gibbsmatch ] ) directly to compute @xmath59 , verifying that we had reproduced the boehler - ross curve ; our result is shown in figure [ tm ] , together with the data from @xcite and some points from plissier s theoretical curve .",
    "( according to @xcite , their data point at 125 gpa marks the onset of melting along the hugoniot .",
    "we will comment on this in the next subsection . )",
    "computed from our full solid and liquid eos ( which reproduces the boehler - ross curve , eq .",
    "( [ tp ] ) ) , the experimental data from @xcite , and points from the theoretical curve in @xcite . ]    now that we have the full two - phase eos , it is profitable to compare our work with another eos for al , due to moriarty et al .",
    "these authors also use a full lattice dynamics treatment of the crystal phonons , although they calculate their @xmath18 two separate ways , using both moriarty s generalized pseudopotential theory ( gpt ) and a local pseudopotential model with parameters chosen to match solid - phase eos data .",
    "we strongly prefer to rely on dft results , as we believe dft has reached such a stage of maturity that it more accurately captures the physics contained in the real hamiltonian of the system , which as we have emphasized we believe to be understood in sufficient depth that it should underlie all of our work .",
    "second , in their treatment of the liquid phase moriarty et al.rely on fluid variational theory , described in detail in @xcite , to compute the least upper bound to the `` real '' liquid free energy ( from a liquid hamiltonian based on pseudopotentials ) that can be obtained from the free energy of a reference system ; moriarty et al.investigate hard - sphere , soft - sphere , and one - component plasma reference systems before settling on the soft - sphere system as providing the best bound .",
    "based on the investigations summarized in @xcite , we claim that we have the actual hamiltonian of the liquid itself , not a hamiltonian based on pseudopotential theory ; furthermore , this hamiltonian decomposes naturally into a dominant term that produces a free energy that can be used directly ( instead of requiring approximation by the free energy of a reference system ) and remaining terms whose contributions to the free energy are known to be small ( see the introduction ) .",
    "the same point we made above for the solid phase applies ; we argue that it is a better strategy in developing eos to try to understand the true hamiltonian of the system , and then to use it when doing statistical mechanics .",
    "almost inevitably , one must make approximations ( which we certainly have done here ) , but we believe we are in a better position to understand and improve upon them if the physical foundation of the eos is as solid as we can make it .",
    "finally , let us make some conservative estimates of the range of applicability of this eos .",
    "any limits will arise from two sources : the validity of the approximation that @xmath151 is negligible in the liquid ( see the introduction ) , and the limited ranges over which the functions @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath59 are known .",
    "let s consider each in turn .",
    "\\(1 ) we know from experiment that @xmath151 is negligible when @xmath155 ( again , see the introduction ) , and judging from trends in the data we suspect @xmath151 will still be small up to @xmath156 , but clearly this term must become relevant as the nuclear motion becomes more gaslike",
    ". thus we shall take care with any data at @xmath157 and @xmath2 such that @xmath2 approaches or exceeds @xmath158 .",
    "\\(2 ) at densities below approximately 6 g/@xmath88 , we are confident that the solid is in the fcc phase , and the liquid free energy is based on this phase , so we trust the full eos here . at higher densities , we must be more circumspect ; the solid may have undergone a phase transition to bcc , and the liquid eos at this density may be based on the wrong solid free energy .",
    "further , as we have indicated earlier , eq .  ( [ tp ] ) for the melt curve has received independent support only up to 200 gpa , so we must be cautious with the liquid eos in regions beyond this point .",
    "we decided to be brave and accept the melt curve as valid up to 400 gpa ; this corresponds to a liquid density of @xmath159 g/@xmath88 , and since this is not far from the probable location of the solid fcc - bcc transition , we take it as the density limit of our eos .",
    "( even if we did not have this concern , we would be restricted to densities below @xmath87 g/@xmath88 , where electronic structure results are available . )",
    "also , the free electron approximation to @xmath30 has been validated only for @xmath160 up to 1/2 ry , or 6.8 ev , at low compression and 1 ry , or 13.6 ev , at high compression , but at higher temperatures the electronic energy and entropy are sensitive to the details of @xmath30 to energies above these limits .",
    "we estimated the values of @xmath2 that begin to probe the unvalidated region of @xmath30 ( roughly @xmath161 ) , and we found that over our valid density range the @xmath162 limit always took precedence .",
    "hence this limit is not relevant for us , but we mention it for completeness , as it may become a concern if the eos is extended to higher densities .",
    "figure [ tplim ] shows the limits @xmath163 g/@xmath88 and @xmath164 of the eos in @xmath165 space , together with the melt curve and the hugoniot ( see the next subsection ) , while figure [ trholim ] shows the same three features in @xmath166 space .        in this figure ,",
    "the melt curve becomes a two - phase region , which we will consider in more detail in the next subsection .",
    "we are confident that this eos is valid within these limits , but we do nt know how far beyond them the inaccuracies begin to appear ; thus we will not be shy about considering data not too far outside this range .",
    "if a shock wave travels at speed @xmath167 through a sample of material , accelerating its particles from rest to speed @xmath168 and changing its density , atomic volume , pressure , and internal energy per atom from @xmath169 , @xmath122 , @xmath118 , and @xmath129 to @xmath157 , @xmath7 , @xmath69 , and @xmath67 , then ( assuming thermal equilibrium before and after the shock ) these quantities must satisfy the rankine - hugoniot relations , @xmath170 derived from considerations of mass , momentum , and energy conservation .",

    "three important considerations in selecting which data to include are ( 1 ) the initial densities of the samples , ( 2 ) the quality of the experimental technique , and ( 3 ) whether the measurements were absolute or relative .",
    "-@xmath168 hugoniot in the intermediate-@xmath69 region , including intersections with the phase boundaries , with data from @xcite . ]    all of the available data were taken using al alloys with densities that differ from the known pure metal value of @xmath171 g/@xmath88 ( predicted correctly by our eos ) ; some alloys are as close as @xmath172 g/@xmath88 while others differ much more .",
    "-@xmath157 hugoniot in the intermediate-@xmath69 region , including intersections with the phase boundaries , with data from @xcite . ]    since hugoniots in general are quite sensitive to the initial density , we chose to compare only with the data for which @xmath169 clustered around @xmath172 g/@xmath88 .",
    "( thus we used only one data point from @xcite , which mainly concerns porous materials .",
    "all of the data from the other references were used . )",
    "we also avoided sources which gathered data using unusual shock wave geometries ( such as @xcite ) , and we also chose not to use the results of indirect or relative measurements , such as @xcite , preferring to rely on the absolute measurements that are available .",
    "finally , we did not use the few data points available ( primarily nuclear - driven ) that lie very far beyond the limits of applicability of our eos ( but see below ) .",
    "the theoretical hugoniot compares well with both the @xmath167-@xmath168 and the @xmath69-@xmath157 data all the way up to the predicted limit of its validity , at approximately @xmath173 gpa ( @xmath174 mbar ) .",
    "more specifically , theory agrees with experiment at @xmath175 gpa ( figures [ usupzoomlowp ] and [ prhozoomlowp ] ) ; at 40 - 125 gpa , theory falls below the experimental error bars by around 1% at most ( figures [ usupzoomlowp ] through [ prhozoomtwoph ] ) ; and theory again lies within the experimental error bars through the liquid phase ( figures [ usup ] , [ prho ] , [ usupzoomtwoph ] , and [ prhozoomtwoph ] ) .",
    "( we recall that given percentage errors in @xmath167 and @xmath168 correspond to roughly the same percentage errors in the @xmath69-@xmath157 plane . )",
    "the presence of theoretical error only in the solid phase is likely due to strength effects , which are present in the solid but not in the liquid , and which are neglected in our hugoniot calculations .",
    "furthermore , as figure [ prhozoomtwoph ] shows , we predict that the hugoniot crosses the two - phase region between @xmath176 g/@xmath88 and @xmath177 g/@xmath88 , corresponding to a range in @xmath69 from 126 to 156 gpa ; this agrees very well with @xcite , in which melting was found to occur between 125 and 150 gpa .",
    "( we note that @xcite used al 2024 , an alloy whose density is sufficiently different from pure al that we did not use hugoniot data taken with that alloy in our figures .",
    "we consider their melting results because , as we saw in the previous subsection , their data are consistent with other experiments that did use pure al . )",
    "the correction to @xmath9 from the previous subsection , shown in figure [ phi0 ] , shifts the hugoniot at pressures below 30 gpa , bringing it into excellent agreement with experiment , while at pressures above 60 gpa or so , the effect on the hugoniot is insignificant .    we have also compared our results with data just beyond the eos limits of validity ; the points in @xcite that match our initial density ( one of which is a reanalysis of the single point in @xcite ) , lying at about 10 mbar , fall noticeably below our hugoniot , and their consistency with the very - high - pressure points of ragan @xcite strongly suggests that they represent the true hugoniot , which thus falls beneath our prediction at higher pressures .",
    "possible errors in our eos at such densities include , in what we estimate to be decreasing order of importance , ( 1 ) the shift from the fcc to the bcc crystal , with a corresponding change in @xmath46 as discussed in the last subsection , ( 2 ) deviations in the melt curve @xmath59 from the boehler - ross form at higher pressures ( the densities of the points in @xcite correspond to melt pressures around 620 gpa according to our eos ) , ( 3 ) the fact that at such high @xmath2 the eos is probing the high - energy region of @xmath30 , and ( 4 ) the neglect of the anharmonic and boundary contributions to the liquid eos ( @xmath2 is only slightly below @xmath140 at these points according to our eos ) .",
    "drawing upon theory developed in @xcite , we have described a framework for constructing eos for elemental solids and liquids , and we have discussed experimental and theoretical results indicating that the framework remains highly accurate at low pressures when certain small effects ( anharmonicity , boundaries , electron - phonon interactions ) are neglected . after displaying the resulting formulas for the helmholtz free energy , we considered the information one needs to evaluate them , and we discussed the combination of experiment and theoretical work that could be used to get this information . finally , as an illustration we constructed an eos for al , established its range of validity based on the inputs to the eos , and compared it with hugoniot data to 5 mbar ; our eos matched the data to the accuracy we expected based on the low - pressure results .",
    "we consider the primary advantage of this method to lie in the fact that it incorporates into the decomposition of the hamiltonian a great deal of accumulated knowledge of condensed matter physics both for the solid and liquid phases ( for example , the fact that the electronic ground state energy is the most appropriate potential for the nuclear motion ) .",
    "if we have indeed captured the correct physics ( and we expect no new physics to enter until the relativistic domain ) , then the eos should have the right functional form , which means that if it is shown to agree with available data , then we have reason to believe that it will be equally accurate in regions where no data are available ; and making predictions where we have no data is the point of having an eos to begin with .",
    "furthermore , the better the foundation we can build , the better our position for intelligently investigating and controlling our approximations .",
    "this discussion bears on the second goal of this paper , which was to learn whether the approximation of neglecting anharmonic , boundary , and electron - phonon effects remains useful at higher pressures .",
    "we already knew , as discussed in the introduction , that at low @xmath69 the anharmonic and electron - phonon terms are small , and we found this from direct calculations ; we also knew that for several elements , over a range of @xmath2 , at low @xmath69 the approximations in question yielded thermal energies and entropies that disagreed with experiments by @xmath4 at most .",
    "our work here has shown that for one material at much higher @xmath69 the approximations yield results that match data along a single curve , the hugoniot , to comparable accuracy . based on our arguments above , that the eos incorporates the correct physics and is thus of the correct functional form , we claim to have shown that this al eos is trustworthy throughout its range of validity , for all @xmath2 and @xmath69 .",
    "the main disadvantage of this method is that it relies on many inputs ( @xmath178 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 for each phase ) which may be available only over limited ranges , and each of these limits also restricts the range of validity of the eos .",
    "our al example amply illustrates this problem ; with a compression range from a little under one to just over two , and a temperature range that reaches only to slightly under 4 ev , this eos is inadequate for many applications at the national laboratories .",
    "we argue , however , that this problem does not indicate a deficiency in the approach ; it only underscores the need for many more dft calculations of these quantities for more materials with ever greater accuracy over ever larger ranges .    in the meantime , though , we would like to be able to say something about elemental solid and liquid eos at higher compressions . we do know that as density increases , the electrons come to dominate the free energy , and it is also known that tfd correctly describes the electrons in the limit of infinite density .",
    "this suggests the following possibility : construct an eos using the present techniques to compressions as high as the available experimental or dft results allow , and then interpolate between these results and the predictions of tfd for higher compressions .",
    "this raises an important question : at what pressures does tfd begin to become accurate ?",
    "conventional wisdom , usually traced back to feynman et al .",
    "@xcite , has held that tfd becomes reliable starting at @xmath179 mbar , but other work @xcite suggests that tfd ( or tf in their case , but tf and tfd converge at high pressures ) deviates noticeably from electronic structure results until 100 mbar at least .",
    "this suggests that the pressure threshold at which tfd is trustworthy has not yet been adequately established ; it would be of great interest to settle this question more definitively .",
