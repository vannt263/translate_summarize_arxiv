    "recently , a new kind of electronics named `` spintronics '' based on spin polarized electrons have created a wave of excitement [ 1 ] . the idea to build a spin diode or a spin transistor is extremely appealing . in order to make progress",

    "we compute the conductance of a non - magnetic impurity in the presence of electron - electron interaction with two different fermi velocities @xmath5 .",
