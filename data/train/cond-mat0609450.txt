    "the recent advances in nanostructure technology allow the fabrication of electronic devices which inherently experience quantum effects in their operation .",
    "there is a need for theoretical tools , not only to understand the behavior of actual nanoscale devices , but also to initiate future research and developments .",
    "the simplest non - relativistic quantum modeling of nanoscale semiconductor devices is based on the schrdinger equation written in solid state domains where the potential is constant and the influence of the lattice is encapsulated in the value of effective electron mass . when the devices are made from semiconductor heterostructures ,",
    "there are many such domains separated among themselves by interfaces where besides the step in potential we also have to consider the discontinuity in effective electron mass @xcite . in the  60",
    "the problem has been solved by applying appropriate boundary conditions @xcite , @xmath0 where @xmath1@xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath1@xmath4 , @xmath5 are the electron wave function and effective mass of the electron to the left ( @xmath6 ) and right ( @xmath7 ) side of a given interface .",
    "the results obtained with the above - described procedure are in agreement with experimental data and the method is widely used in electron transport computations through semiconductor heterostructures @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this model is that the transmission coefficient can be calculated using the simple and elegant method of the transfer matrix @xcite .",
    "however , the assumed boundary conditions ( [ eq1 ] ) are imposed somewhat artificially in order to conserve the particle current without to have a deeper physical motivation .",
    "another attitude is to start with the dirac equation even though it is clear that the relativistic effects have to be very small .",
    "nevertheless , the relativistic linear dependence between energy and mass could offer some technical advantages for finding appropriate connection conditions at interfaces where the potential and the effective mass present discontinuities .",
    "few years ago , the one - dimensional dirac equation was successfully used for treating problems with variable mass avoiding several difficulties of the non - relativistic theory @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we would like to continue this study using the _ normalized _ plane wave solutions of the three - dimensional dirac equation in helicity basis .",
    "our purpose is to derive the relativistic version of the transfer matrix method for the motion in a fixed direction of a dirac electron with point - dependent effective mass , passing through rectangular barriers of arbitrary profile .",
    "we show that the use of the dirac equation allows one to impose simple connection prescriptions at interfaces . however , the price to pay for working with variable mass is that there are many energy scales corresponding to different mass values .",
    "for this reason we need to rescale the experimental potential if we want to measure the energies with respect to an unique energy scale .",
    "the rescaled potential will be considered the appropriate relativistic potential of our problems .",
    "we show that only in this way the non - relativistic limit of our approach recovers the results derived from schr \" odinger equation with the conditions ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section we present the well - known",
    "plane wave solutions of the dirac equation in the helicity basis .",
    "the next section is devoted to the problem of one - dimensional rectangular barriers of any shape allowing us to find the relativistic transfer matrix in section four .",
    "finally , it is shown that in the non - relativistic limit this matrix becomes just the desired traditional one @xcite .",
    "let us consider the minkowski space - time in a frame of coordinates @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and the metric @xmath10 . in natural units ( with @xmath11 ) the time",
    "is @xmath12 while the space coordinates , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are the components of the vector @xmath16 . in this frame",
    ", the relativistic quantum motion of an electron of mass @xmath17 and charge @xmath18 , in an arbitrary external electromagnetic field @xmath19 , is governed by the dirac equation @xcite , @xmath20 that produces the conserved current ( in units of @xmath18 ) @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the dirac adjoint of the spinor @xmath23 . in what follows ,",
    "we take the @xmath24-matrices in the standard representation ( with diagonal @xmath25 ) @xcite .    here",
    "we are interested to study the quantum modes in the particular case of a space domain @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 for any @xmath29 . in this domain",
    "the dirac equation can be analytically solved and different quantum modes can be well - defined using complete sets of commuting operators .",
    "thus the plane wave solutions are eigenspinors of the complete set of commuting operators @xmath30 constituted by the dirac operator , @xmath31 , momentum @xmath32 , and the pauli - lubanski operator @xmath33 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues , @xmath17 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , define the plane wave spinor of positive frequency , momentum @xmath34 , energy @xmath36 and helicity @xmath35 that reads @xcite @xmath37 we denoted by @xmath38 the normalized pauli spinors of the helicity basis that satisfy @xmath39^+\\xi_{\\lambda'}(\\vec{k})=\\delta_{\\lambda,\\lambda'}$ ] ( where @xmath40 are the pauli matrices and @xmath41 ) .",
    "one can verify that each solution ( [ s ] ) is normalized as @xmath42 and produces the current @xmath43 along the direction @xmath34 .",
    "the general results presented above help us to write down the solutions of simpler one - dimensional problems along the third axis .",
    "of a special interest is the problem of the electron moving through a system of @xmath44 rectangular barriers of arbitrary shape . in general , the system of barriers is constituted by @xmath44 domains @xmath45 $ ] where the potential @xmath46 takes constant values @xmath47 ( fig[fig1 ] ) .",
    "these domains are limited by plane interfaces at fixed points , @xmath48 , among them those from @xmath49 and @xmath50 represent the interfaces between the system of barriers and the domains outside , denoted by @xmath51 $ ] and , respectively , @xmath52 .",
    "it is natural to consider that in these latter domains the potential vanishes , @xmath53 .",
    "in addition , we assume that in each domain @xmath54 the electron has the _ effective _ mass @xmath55 while in the domains @xmath56 and @xmath57 its mass is just the _ bare _ mass @xmath17 .    in special relativity",
    "the energy scale depends on the value of the rest mass while the electromagnetic potential is defined up to a gauge .",
    "therefore , in problems where this mass is replaced by a point - dependent effective mass , we could introduce an _ unique _ energy scale only by choosing suitable gauge fixings , dealing with the different values of the effective mass . in these conditions we are encouraged to consider in each domain @xmath54 the _ relativistic _ potential @xmath58 instead of the experimental one @xmath47 .",
    "the relation among these potentials has to be derived from a natural supplemental condition which will fixe up the gauge in the domains @xmath54 .        in any domain @xmath54",
    "there exists a plane wave solution of energy @xmath59 and helicity @xmath35 propagating in the sense of the positive semiaxis @xmath60 , @xmath61 which depends on the constants @xmath62 and scalar momentum @xmath63 we note that in this case the helicity spinors coincide to those of the spin basis since the spin is projected on the third axis .",
    "consequently , the two - component spinors @xmath64 take the usual form @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the plane wave solution with the same @xmath59 and @xmath35 but propagating in the opposite sense reads @xmath67 the conclusion is that , in a domain @xmath54 , the most general plane wave solutions of energy @xmath59 and helicity @xmath35 are given by the linear combinations @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are arbitrary complex numbers .",
    "each solution ( [ sol ] ) gives the total current @xmath71 which does not depend on helicity .",
    "finally we can establish the relation among the relativistic and experimental potentials assuming that in a domain @xmath54 the momentum @xmath72 vanishes only when the total non - relativistic energy @xmath73 , calculated with respect to the bare mass @xmath17 , equals the experimental potential @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , according to eq .",
    "( [ ki ] ) we obtain the form of our relativistic potentials @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "in what follows we shall derive the transfer matrix in the pure scattering case without wells or tunneling effects .",
    "this means that the energy satisfies the condition @xmath76 and @xmath72 take only real values .",
    "in addition , we specify that the global solutions we consider here have the same fixed energy @xmath59 and helicity @xmath35 in all the domains @xmath54 .",
    "this correspond to the experimental situation when the interactions able to produce spin - flip are absent .    in problems involving many domains",
    "@xmath54 it is difficult to manipulate solutions of the form ( [ sol ] ) .",
    "for this reason we replace these solution by _ associated _ two - dimensional vectors @xcite , @xmath77 which carry all the information we need for calculating the currents ( [ j ] ) .",
    "indeed , we observe that these currents can be expressed only in terms of @xmath78 as @xmath79^+\\sigma_3v_i(z)\\,,\\quad \\forall \\ , z\\in d_i\\,.\\ ] ] thus the vectors ( [ v ] ) become the basic elements of the relativistic formalism of the transfer matrix for rectangular barriers @xcite . in the domains @xmath80 and @xmath81 , where the potential vanishes and the mass is @xmath17 , the spinors @xmath82 and @xmath83 have the general form given by eqs .",
    "( [ sol1 ] ) , ( [ sol2 ] ) and ( [ sol ] ) with the same momentum , @xmath84 , and constants , @xmath85 .",
    "these spinors are associated to the vectors @xmath86 now , the problem is to find the transfer matrix , @xmath87 , which transforms the @xmath88 vector into the @xmath89 one as @xmath90 allowing one to calculate the transmission coefficient .",
    "the global solution of energy @xmath59 and helicity @xmath35 is continuous in each point @xmath91 which means that we must impose the conditions @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "after a few manipulation we find that these conditions lead to simple relations among the associated vectors , @xmath94 where the matrices @xmath95 depend on the constants @xmath96 the last step is to introduce the translation matrices @xmath97 which transform @xmath98 into @xmath99 . with these elements",
    "we can write down the final expression of the _ relativistic _ transition matrix @xmath100m_{n+1}\\,.\\ ] ]    let us observe that for @xmath101 , when @xmath72 are real numbers , the matrices @xmath102 defined by eq .",
    "( [ vmv ] ) have the property @xmath103 which guarantees the conservation of the total current , @xmath104 , calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ jv ] ) . in these circumstances",
    ", taking @xmath105 we have @xmath106 which allows us to define the transmission coefficient @xmath107 we note that @xmath108 results to be a function only of energy , being independent on the helicity of the electron passing through the rectangular barriers .",
    "of course , the function @xmath109 calculated here is defined only on the domain @xmath110 . however , starting with the present theory , the extension to energies smaller than @xmath111 can be done but this requires specific treatment because of the wells producing discrete energy levels or tunneling effects which need to be treated with specific methods .",
    "here we constructed the relativistic version of the transfer matrix for the dirac electron moving through rectangular barriers , in a similar manner as in the non - relativistic theory based on the schr \" odinger equation .",
    "our approach allows one to calculate the transfer matrices using the same rules but with matrices @xmath112 of different forms .",
    "let us see what happens with our theory in the non - relativistic limit , for small values @xmath113",
    ". in this limit the quantities @xmath114 remain unchanged but we have @xmath115 . consequently , we find that @xmath116 remaining with the terms @xmath117 which _ coincide _ to those of refs .",
    "@xcite at least in the domain @xmath101 considered here .",
    "thus , the general conclusion is that the non - relativistic limit of our approach based on the three - dimensional dirac equation with the relativistic potentials ( [ vr ] ) reproduces identically the results of the traditional method based on the schr \" odinger equation and conditions ( [ eq1 ] ) . moreover ,",
    "relativistic corrections can be also calculated but so far these seem to be small in the usual regime the electronic devices work .    in other respects , the results obtained here indicate that the use of the dirac equation could be helpful in other problems concerning the motion of electrons in semiconductor heterostructures as suggested in ref .",
