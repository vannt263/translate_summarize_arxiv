    "adiabatic rapid passage ( arp ) is a well - known procedure for inverting the bloch vector of a two - level system ( qubit ) @xcite .",
    "this is accomplished by inverting an external field @xmath4 which couples to the qubit , and along which the qubit is initially aligned .",
    "the field inversion is done on a time - scale that is large compared to the inverse rabi frequency @xmath5 ( viz .",
    "adiabatic ) , though small compared to the thermal relaxation time @xmath6 ( viz .",
    "rapid ) . in the usual case ,",
    "@xmath4 remains within a plane that includes the origin : @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "arp can be used to implement a not gate on the quantum state of a qubit . if one identifies the computational basis states @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , with the spin - up and spin - down eigenstates along the initial direction of the external field @xmath12 , then arp maps @xmath13 which is the defining operation of a not gate .",
    "occurrence of a transition during arp corresponds to an error in the not gate since the bloch vector is not inverted , and thus @xmath14 , ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "thus we can identify the arp transition probability with the not gate error probability . for arp",
    ", the adiabatic nature of the inversion ensures that the error probability is exponentially small .",
    "the price paid for this reliability , however , is an extremely slow not gate .    in twisted adiabatic rapid passage",
    ", the external field is allowed to twist around its initial direction with azimuthal angle @xmath0 at the same time that it is adiabatically inverted : @xmath16 .",

    "zwanziger et .",
    "@xcite were able to experimentally realize arp with quadratic twist and obtained results in agreement with the predictions of reference  .",
    "in this paper we will consider twisted rapid passage with polynomial twist , @xmath1 , and we will focus exclusively on qubit inversions done at _ non - adiabatic _ rates . although we will briefly consider quadratic twist in section  [ sec2 ] as a test case for our numerical simulations , our interest will _ not _ be the geometric effect of reference  . instead , our primary focus will be on establishing the existence of multiple avoided crossings during twisted rapid passage when @xmath20 , and with exploring some of their consequences .",
    "after general considerations ( section  [ sec2 ] ) , we will explicitly examine cubic ( @xmath21 ) and quartic ( @xmath22 ) twist , and will provide clear evidence that the multiple avoided crossings produce strong interference effects in the qubit transition probability .",
    "the transition probability is shown to be a function of the twist strength @xmath3 , which can be used to control the time - separation of the avoided crossings , and hence the character of the interference ( constructive or destructive ) .",
    "cubic and quartic twist are examined in sections  [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] , respectively .",
    "we shall see that interference between the multiple avoided crossings can greatly enhance or suppress qubit transitions .",
    "the interference effects are a direct consequence of the temporal phase coherence of the wavefunction .",
    "the ability to vary this coherence by varying the temporal separation of the avoided crossings renders twisted rapid passage with adjustable twist strength into a temporal interferometer through which qubit transitions can be controlled .",
    "it will be shown that quartic twist can implement qubit inversion non - adiabatically while operating at a fidelity that exceeds the threshold for fault tolerant operation .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec5 ] , we summarize our results and discuss possible application of this interference mechanism to quantum computing . in particular , we describe how one might use non - adiabatic rapid passage with quartic twist to construct a fast fault - tolerant quantum cnot gate .",
    "it is worth noting that experimental _",
    "confirmation _ of the work described in this paper has recently been carried out by zwanziger et .",
    "they have realized _",
    "non_-_adiabatic _ rapid passage with both cubic and quartic twist , and have observed clear evidence of constructive and destructive interference in the qubit transition probability due to interference between the avoided crossings , with excellent agreement between the experimental data and our numerical simulations .",
    "this experimental work provides clear proof - of - principle for our thesis that controllable quantum interference exists during twisted rapid passage . with this thesis",
    "now experimentally confirmed , future research can focus on applying this interference to the task of constructing fast fault tolerant quantum cnot and not gates .",
    "after this paper was submitted , previous work was brought to our attention which also examined models of rapid passage in which more than one avoided crossing is possible , and in which interference effects were also considered @xcite . these papers focused solely on the adiabatic limit .",
    "application of this adiabatic theory to the zwanziger experiment yields predictions that are in poor agreement with the experimental results @xcite .",
    "this failing is no doubt a consequence of the non - adiabatic character of this experiment whose results thus lies beyond the scope of the adiabatic theory developed in these papers .",
    "in contrast , the work we present below is principally interested in the non - adiabatic limit , and our simulation results are in full agreement with experiment @xcite .",

    "it has been shown that a quantum computation of arbitrarily long duration becomes possible if the quantum logic gates used to implement the computation all have error probabilities ( per gate operation ) which lie below the threshold @xmath195 for fault tolerant operation @xcite .",
    "this threshold has been estimated to be @xmath196 @xcite . in terms of the gate fidelity @xmath197 ,",
    "the more optimistic estimate for @xmath195 gives @xmath198 .",
    "we see that for @xmath186 and @xmath199 , twisted rapid passage with quartic twist gives a gate fidelity of @xmath200 which exceeds the best case estimate for fault tolerant operation @xmath198 . this fault tolerant performance is achieved while inverting the qubit at a _",
    "non_-_adiabatic _ rate .",
    "the reader should note that the values @xmath186 and @xmath201 can be realized with existing nmr technology ( see section  [ sec5d ] ) .",
    "our analysis raises the exciting possibility that non - adiabatic rapid passage with quartic twist might provide a means of realizing _ fast fault - tolerant _ not and cnot gates .",
    "the novelty of this prospect is the marriage of operational speed with fault - tolerance .",
    "this marriage of speed and reliability is a direct consequence of the destructive interference which is possible between the 3 avoided crossings that arise during rapid passage with quartic twist .",
    "quantum cnot gates are ubiquitous in quantum computing and quantum error correction @xcite .",
    "thus , determining how to implement them in a fast fault tolerant manner is a potentially significant development for the field .",
    "it has been our aim in this paper to show that multiple avoided crossings can arise during twisted rapid passage , and that by varying their time - separation , interference effects are produced which allow for a direct control over qubit transitions .",
    "this time - separation is controlled through the ( dimensionless ) twist strength @xmath202 , and the resulting interference can be constructive ( enhancing transitions ) or destructive ( reducing transitions ) . for nth - order polynomial twist , @xmath203 , where @xmath3 is the ( dimensionful ) twist strength , @xmath204 is the energy - gap separating the qubit energy - levels at an avoided crossing , and @xmath29 is the inversion rate of the external field @xmath4 ( see section  [ sec2 ] ) .",
    "the interference effects are a consequence of the temporal phase coherence of the wavefunction .",
    "the ability to vary this coherence by varying the temporal separation of the avoided crossings renders twisted rapid passge with adjustable twist strength into a temporal interferometer through which qubit transitions can be greatly enhanced or suppressed .",
    "cubic and quartic twist were explicitly considered in this paper as they are , respectively , the simplest examples of odd - order and even - order polynomial twist in which these interference effects are expected to occur .",
    "although we have focused on these two cases , we do not mean to suggest that these pulses are the best of all possible twisted rapid passage pulses .",
    "a search is currently underway for other twisted rapid passage pulses that might produce stronger destructive interference , and hence , faster , more fault tolerant quantum cnot and not gates ( see below for further discussion ) .",
    "we have seen that this interference mechanism can be used to pump qubit energy - levels , as well as to strongly quench qubit transitions during _",
    "non_-_adiabatic _ twisted rapid passage . although cubic twist proved to be more effective at pumping than quartic twist , quartic twist was found to be much more effective at quenching qubit transitions .",
    "we have seen that quartic twist allows qubit inversion to be done both non - adiabatically and at fidelities that exceed the threshold for fault tolerant operation .",
    "the marriage of operational speed with reliability is a direct consequence of the destructive interference that is possible between the 3 avoided crossings that can arise during rapid passage with quartic twist .",
    "we now describe a procedure for implementing a quantum cnot gate using twisted rapid passage in the context of liquid state nmr .",
    "if the liquid has low viscosity , one can ignore dipolar coupling between the qubits , and if the remaining heisenberg interaction between the qubits is weak compared to the individual qubit zeeman energies , it can be well - approximated by an ising interaction @xcite . under these conditions , the hamiltonian ( in frequency units ) for the control ( @xmath205 ) and target ( @xmath206 ) qubits is : @xmath207 here @xmath208 ( @xmath209 ) is the resonance frequency of the isolated control ( target ) qubit ; @xmath210 is the ising coupling constant ; and @xmath211 .",
    "we choose the single qubit computational basis states ( cbs ) to be @xmath212 and",
    "@xmath213 ; @xmath214 ; @xmath215 , and they are the eigenstates of @xmath216 . the energy - levels ( in frequency units )",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig16 ] , where @xmath217     energy - level structure appropriate for implementing a quantum cnot operation using twisted rapid passage .",
    "the corresponding energies ( in frequency units ) appear to the right of the energy levels . ]",
    "given this energy - level structure , we can implement a quantum cnot operation on the two qubits by sweeping through the @xmath218 resonance using twisted rapid passage .",
    "decoupling @xcite is used to switch off the dynamics of the control qubit so that only the target qubit responds to the rapid passage pulse .",
    "since the two states @xmath219 and @xmath220 are not resonant , they do not respond to the twisted rapid passage pulse .",
    "thus , @xmath221 on the other hand , for the @xmath222 and @xmath223 states , the combination of decoupling and sweeping through the @xmath218 resonance means that only the target qubit has its spin flipped .",
    "thus , @xmath221 and we see that this procedure implements a quantum cnot operation on the two qubits .      because of the fundamental significance of quantum cnot gates to quantum computing and quantum error correction @xcite , it is hoped that the feasibility of using rapid passage with quartic twist to implement this gate might be tested experimentally ( see penultimate paragraph of section  [ sec1 ] ) .",
    "experimental realization of polynomial twist @xmath224 should be possible through an adaptation of the procedure used by zwanziger et .",
    "@xcite to realize quadratic twist .",
    "thus : ( 1 ) the driving rf - field is linearly polarized along the x - axis in the lab - frame with @xmath225 ; ( 2 ) the resonance offset @xmath226 ( see eqn .",
    "( [ labham ] ) ) is produced by linearly sweeping the detector frequency @xmath227 through the resonance at the larmor frequency @xmath228 such that @xmath229 ; and ( 3 ) twist is introduced by sweeping the rf - frequency @xmath230 through the resonance at @xmath228 in such a way that @xmath231 .",
    "it is worth noting that the resonance condition @xmath232 is identical to our existence condition for avoided crossings , eqn .",
    "( [ cond ] ) .",
    "note that in our paper the external field inversion takes place over the time - interval ( @xmath233 , @xmath234 ) ; the external field crosses the x - y plane at @xmath28 and is initially aligned along the @xmath235 direction .",
    "the appendix provides a translation key which relates the theoretical parameters of this paper to the experimental parameters of the zwanziger experiments @xcite .    before leaving the subject of experimental realization of rapid passage with quartic twist ,",
    "two further remarks are in order .",
    "first , to insure that all qubits are inverted when a spread of resonance frequencies occurs , it is necessary to require that the frequency sweep cover a large enough interval that the entire spread of resonance frequencies is included in it .",
    "this gaurantees that all qubits will have passed through resonance by the end of the frequency sweep .",
    "second , a range of rf field strengths can also be accomodated so long as @xmath236 .",
    "this condition insures that the frequency sweep begins far from resonance for all rf field strengths , and that transitions will continue to occur only near the avoided crossings .",
    "one therefore anticipates that in this case also , the interference effects will continue to occur as predicted .",
    "for reasonably good samples , magnets , and rf sources these constraints can be satisfied , and the interference effects presented above should be readily observable .",
    "this is in fact what is found experimentally  @xcite .",
    "having introduced twisted rapid passage with polynomial twist , and pointed out the possible advantages of quartic twist for quantum computing , it is natural to ask how quartic twist compares with the more familiar @xmath237-pulse which can also be used to implement quantum cnot and not gates .",
    "we begin by comparing the inversion time for quartic twist with that of a comparable @xmath237-pulse .",
    "we focus on quartic twist with @xmath186 and @xmath238 as this choice of parameters yields a gate fidelity @xmath239 ( see section  [ sec4c ] ) which exceeds the threshold for fault tolerant gate operation @xmath240 .",
    "we now show that this case achieves fault tolerant operation while simultaneously matching the inversion speed of a @xmath237-pulse . in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , the basic experimental parameters for twisted rapid passage are @xmath241 , @xmath3 , @xmath242 , and @xmath243 , and they are related to our theoretical parameters by eqns .",
    "( [ a8 ] ) and ( [ a3 ] ) .",
    "@xmath243 continues to denote the duration of the twisted rapid passage pulse . because a twisted rapid passage sweep must begin far from the avoided crossings , @xmath241 and @xmath242",
    "can not be chosen independently . in the rf - frame , the asymptotic effective magnetic field must lie near the z - axis so that @xmath244 .",
    "choosing @xmath245 hz gives @xmath246 hz .",
    "both of these values can be achieved with existing nmr technology .",
    "writing @xmath247 , eqn .",
    "( [ a9 ] ) gives @xmath248 with @xmath186 , this gives @xmath249 by comparison , the inversion time for a @xmath237-pulse with rf - amplitude @xmath245 hz is @xmath250 msec .",
    "thus , twisted rapid passage with quartic twist is clearly capable of matching the inversion speed of a comparable @xmath237-pulse while still exceeding the threshold for fault tolerant operation . on the other hand ,",
    "the error probability for a typical @xmath237-pulse is @xmath251 due to , for example , inhomogenities in the rf field amplitude .",
    "this corresponds to a fidelity @xmath252 so that , unlike the equally fast quartic twist pulse which acts fault tolerantly , the @xmath237-pulse falls _ short _ of the threshold for fault tolerant operation @xmath253 .",
    "we hope in the future to examine higher order versions of polynomial twist to determine whether they have more effective quenching and/or robustness properties than cubic and quartic twist .",
    "we have also done preliminary work on the interesting case of periodic twist : @xmath254 .",
    "as we have seen , polynomial twist only allows 13 avoided crossings to occur during rapid passage .",
    "one can show that periodic twist allows the number of avoided crossings that occur during rapid passage to be modified through variation of the twist amplitude @xmath255 and frequency @xmath256 .",
    "we intend to explore how the interference effects considered here are modified when more than 3 avoided crossings can occur .",
