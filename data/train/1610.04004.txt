    "several su(3 ) chiral - model eft approaches to the @xmath2-nucleon interaction have been presented in recent years , demonstrating good agreement with each other at threshold and above , where they are constrained by some @xmath3 low - energy scattering and reaction data . at threshold , the precise measurement of strong - interaction level shift and width of the 1@xmath4 state in the kaonic atom of hydrogen by the siddharta collaboration  @xcite provides an important constraint on the @xmath1p interaction , in addition to three previously known threshold branching ratios . however , as shown recently @xcite the resulting @xmath0 scattering amplitudes appear to be strongly model dependent when extrapolating to energies below threshold and also with respect to their pole content . moreover , for the @xmath5 amplitude different models predict widely different results both below threshold and above .",
    "an algorithm for constructing self - consistently the density dependent single - nucleon part @xmath6 of the @xmath1-nucleus optical potential @xmath7 from energy dependent @xmath8 amplitudes was presented by ciepl et al .",

    "these observables include for the first time some old experimental results from bubble chambers on absorption at rest of @xmath1 mesons on nuclei @xcite .",
    "specifically , we calculate the _ fraction _ of absorptions on a single nucleon out of all absorptions at rest in kaonic atoms , and compare with these experimental results in order to place a new constraint on the @xmath12 model - amplitudes input .",

    "the two acceptable sets of amplitudes turn out to be quite similar , and in section [ sec : discuss ] we discuss in detail the interplay between the single - nucleon amplitudes and the full optical potential based on these two sets of amplitudes . in particular , it now becomes possible to relate the origin of previously observed geometrical features of phenomenological potentials that fit the kaonic atom data to these theoretical @xmath8 amplitudes .",
