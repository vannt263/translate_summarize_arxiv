    "a striking commonality between the recently discovered iron pnictides superconductors@xcite and the high-@xmath6 cuprates is that in both cases superconductivity emerges on doping antiferromagnetic parent compounds . in trying to unravel the mechanisms of superconductivity frustrated",
    "quantum antiferromagnets on the square lattice have been subject to intense research over the last decades with particular interest in the extreme quantum limit @xmath7 relevant for the cuprates , whereas the interest in higher spin values increased tremendously with the discovery of the pnictides .",
    "thereby , the heisenberg model with antiferromagnetic exchange couplings @xmath5 and @xmath3 between nearest neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest neighbor ( nnn ) has served as a prototype model for studying magnetic frustration . on a classical level ,",
    "one finds nel order to be stable for @xmath8 whereas for larger ratios the classical ground state is give by a stripe - antiferromagnet with ordering wave - vector @xmath9 .",
    "not surprisingly , the @xmath5-@xmath3 model has been used to rationalize the @xmath9 magnetism@xcite of the iron pnictide superconductors and to subsequently calculate the magnetic excitation spectra@xcite where the incorporation of a strong anisotropy between the nn couplings turned out to be necessary to reproduce the low energy spin - wave excitations .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that the strong anisotropies in the magnetism@xcite , but also in electronic properties@xcite of the pnictides originate in the coupling to orbital degrees of freedom arising from an orbital degeneracy of an intermediate @xmath0 spin state@xcite .",
    "even if the charge degrees of freedom are not completely localized , the @xmath5-@xmath3 model can be used as the starting point for a symmetry - based analysis of magnetism and superconductivity in the iron - based superconductors  xu+08,hu+08 .",
    "the @xmath10 expansion serves as a natural starting point to investigate the stability of the classical orders against quantum fluctuations which are expected to induce a paramagnetic phase near @xmath11 where both orders compete .",
    "indeed , on the level of lowest order linear spin - wave theory one finds an intermediate paramagnetic phase for all spin valueschandra+88 .",
    "however , the incorporation of spin - wave interactions within a modified spin - wave theory ( mswt)@xcite or the sbmftmila+91 drastically changes this picture . within both approaches one finds a dramatic stabilization of the classical orders by quantum fluctuation for the nel order even up to values considerably larger than the classical threshold value @xmath11 .",
    "this has been interpreted as an order - out - of - disorder phenomenon giving rise to a fluctuation induced first order transition between the two orders .",
    "this picture has been confirmed recently by a functional one - loop renormalization group analysiskruger+06 where it was shown that the nel phase becomes unstable towards a fluctuation induced first order transition for @xmath12 .",
    "surely , it is questionable if the semiclassical treatment can correctly account for the quantum fluctuations in the regime of strong frustration and small spins .",
    "in fact , in the case @xmath7 various numerical studies including exact diagonalizationdagotto+89,schulz+92,schulz+96,sindzingre04 , variational monte carlocapriotti+00,capriotti+01 series expansiongerlfand+89,gerlfand90,singh+99,sushkov+01,sushkov+02 as well as the coupled cluster approach@xcite give the consistent picture that in the regime @xmath13 no magnetic order is present clearly indicating that the aforementioned semiclassical treatments overestimate the stability of the ordered states .",
    "another key observation of the series expansion and in particular of the unbiased exact diagonalization studies is that in the paramagnetic phase the lattice symmetry is spontaneously broken due to the formation of columnar valence bond solid order .",
    "such states have been predicted before@xcite on the basis of a large @xmath14 treatment for non frustrated systems in the absence of long - range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "these depend however crucially on the value of the spin , revealing the subtle workings of the spin berry phases ( see e.g. [ ] and references therein ) .",
    "for @xmath7 these act to give a special stability to valence bond pair singlets involving nearest - neighbor spins , and the quantum disordered phases are actually valence bond crystals breaking the translational symmetry of the square lattice further to fourfold degenerate spin - peierls states .",
    "but for @xmath0 the berry phases act in favor of the formation of chain singlets@xcite that can stack either along the @xmath15 or @xmath16 direction of the square lattice yielding a twofold degenerate ground state .",
    "heisenberg system with spatially anisotropic nearest - neighbor couplings @xmath1 , @xmath2 and isotropic next - nearest - neighbor couplings @xmath17 . pending the balance of these couplings one finds either a simple staggered- ( a ) or stripe ( b ) antiferromagnetic order .",
    "in the limit of isolated chains a stack of isolated haldane spin chains is formed ( c ) and based on our dmrg calculations we could conclude that these survive all the way to the isotropic limit in the vicinity of the point of maximal frustration ( @xmath18 ) . ]    in this paper we investigate the @xmath0 version of the spatially anisotropic @xmath19-@xmath17 model , given by the hamiltonian @xmath20 where the first two sums run over nn spins with exchange couplings @xmath21 in @xmath15 and @xmath16 directions , respectively , and the third sum runs over all nnn pairs with exchange couplings @xmath17 as illustrated in fig  [ fig : intro ] .",
    "we note that both the spatially isotropic @xmath19-@xmath17 model as well as the decoupled haldane spin - chain limit appear as special cases of hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "unlike for @xmath7 this model has been hardly explored for @xmath0 despite the potential relevance for the iron pnictides , and to best of our knowledge exact diagonalization studies are not available . in a very recent coupled cluster treatment@xcite",
    "it has been found that at the isotropic point @xmath22 the nel and stripe ordered phases are separated by a first order transition at @xmath23 slightly smaller than the mswt@xcite and sbmft@xcite results and that the transition remains first order up to an anisotropy @xmath24 . for stronger anisotropies",
    "the authors find continuous transitions very close to the classical transition line @xmath25 , although they were not able to resolve an intermediate paramagnetic region within the numerical resolution . on contrary ,",
    "a two step dmrg study@xcite at the particular point @xmath26 indicated a much wider non - magnetic region with a spin - gap reaching its maximum @xmath27 close to the maximally frustrated point @xmath28 , which is only slightly below the gap @xmath29 [ ] of an isolated haldane chainhaldane83a , haldane83b .",
    "starting from the haldane chain limit ( @xmath30 ) it has been predicted by monte carlo simulations@xcite as well as analytically@xcite that an infinitesimal coupling @xmath1 leads to the destruction of the topological string order@xcite of the haldane chain . however , due to the protection by the finite energy gap of the spin-1 haldane chain all other ground - state properties as well as the thermodynamics are only minimally affected by a small interchain coupling @xmath1 and a finite , albeit small@xcite coupling is necessary to establish magnetic long range order .",
    "whereas a similar reasoning should hold for a vanishing nn coupling perpendicular to the chains ( @xmath31 ) and small diagonal coupling @xmath3 the haldane chain phase seems to be considerably more stable against the simultaneous increase of the two mutually frustrating couplings @xmath1 and @xmath3 as indicated by two step dmrg results showing an almost negligible reduction of the spin gap for moderate interchain couplings@xcite .",
    "this suggests that the paramagnetic phase of the frustrated two dimensional spin model can be viewed as a continuation of the haldane spin chain .",
    "recently , based on a theoretical method with a continuous deformation of the @xmath5-@xmath3 model , the ground state at the special isotropic case @xmath32 has been conjectured@xcite to be a two - fold degenerate valence bond solid state along either the horizontal or vertical direction of the square lattice .",
    "the main result of this paper is that by employing dmrg and by studying systematically how matters evolve as function of increasing anisotropy we arrive at solid evidence for the smooth continuation between the haldane chain phase and an isotropic disordered phase near @xmath32 .    since for @xmath0 exact diagonalization",
    "is restricted to very small system sizes and since the quantum monte carlo method suffers from the infamous sign problem in the presence of frustration we employ the dmrg methodwhite92 to map out the phase diagram of the spatially anisotropic @xmath33 model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) over the whole parameter range including the decoupled haldane spin chains and the isotropic @xmath19-@xmath17 model as limiting cases .",
    "the dmrg has the merits of not being biased as analytical treatments based on @xmath10 or @xmath34 expansions , being capable of dealing with frustrated systems , and allowing to investigate much bigger system than possible with exact diagonalization .",
    "moreover , it is capable of reproducing the spin gap of the decoupled haldane chain limit with high accuracy@xcite .",
    "the resulting phase diagram is contrasted by analytical results we obtain within a generalization of the sbmft to the anisotropic system .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec.sbmft ] we outline the sbmft and calculate the resulting phase diagram which is used for comparison with the numerical results . in sec .",
    "[ sec.dmrg ] we use the dmrg to construct the phase diagram by a careful finite - size analysis of the magnetic structure factor at the ordering wave vectors of the two magnetically ordered phases as well as of the spin - gap in the non magnetic region as a function of the nnn coupling @xmath3 for various ratios of the nn couplings @xmath1 and @xmath2 . finally , in sec .",

    "interestingly , the stabilization of the nel phase above the classical transition point is in agreement with the sbmft .    despite the apparent failure of the semiclassical sbmft in dealing with the strong quantum fluctuations in the boundary region between the two magnetically ordered phases",
    "it is interesting to note that the paramagnetic region covers the phase boundaries obtained by sbmft for the most of @xmath149 region except for the part close to the isotropic limit and that the points where the spin gap is maximum ( indicated by crosses and dotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : phasediagram ] ) are almost on top of both the first order transition line as well as of the two narrow second order lines obtained within sbmft .",
    "-@xmath3 model determined by dmrg .",
    "the nel order and stripe order phases are separated by a paramagnetic regime with the boundaries denoted by the red line with full circles for the upper and the blank line with full squares for the lower transition points , respectively . in the middle of the paramagnetic region",
    "lies in a dotted line with crosses which marks the maximal spin-1 gap @xmath189 .",
    "note that the symbols of circle , square , and triangular denote the phase transition points determined by dmrg in the previous figures .",
    ", width=345,height=230 ]",
    "in summary , we have studied the frustrated spin-1 heisenberg @xmath1-@xmath190-@xmath17 model on a square lattice numerically using the dmrg method and analytically employing the schwinger - boson mean - field theory ( sbmft ) .",
    "interestingly , this model contains both the isotropic @xmath19-@xmath17 model as well as decoupled haldane spin chains as limiting cases .",
    "moreover , it has attracted a lot of attention recently since it has been motivated as an effective model to describe the @xmath70-magnetism and the low - energy spin - wave excitations of the celebrated novel iron pnictide superconductors .",
    "furthermore it has been suggested that the drastic reduction of magnetic moments to a value of 0.4 @xmath191 is caused by strong quantum fluctuations in the vicinity of a continuous phase transition .",
    "however , to the present day the phase diagram has not been determined yet .    within both the sbmft and the dmrg we find that the nel phase is stabilized considerably by quantum fluctuations above the classically stable region up to a relatively strong anisotropy between the nn couplings .",
    "however , in all other regards the phase diagrams obtained by the two methods clearly disagree , indicating the importance of the strong quantum fluctuations .",
    "the sbmft suggest a fluctuation induced first order transition between the nel and the stripe antiferromagnets terminating at a tricritical point and splitting into two second order lines separated by an intermediate paramagnetic region only for large anisotropies .",
    "although the existence of a tricritical point and a hardly seizable paramagnetic strip terminating at the decoupled haldane spin chain point ( @xmath103 ) are consistent with a recent coupled cluster calculation@xcite , the sbmft definitely falls short on approaching the haldane chain limit .",
    "this becomes clear by a comparison with quantum monte carlo simulations@xcite showing a much larger region of stability of the haldane chain phase against interchain couplings @xmath1 .",
    "also the previous two - step dmrg calculation@xcite at @xmath26 indicates a paramagnetic region being an order of magnitude wider than found within the sbmft .    on the contrary",
    ", the phase diagram obtained within dmrg by a careful finite size scaling of the magnetic structure factor and the spin gap is consistent with both the qmc and the previous dmrg results .",
    "furthermore the spin gap in the decoupled chain limit agrees well with the exact value for the isolated haldane chain .",
    "the width of the paramagnetic region slightly decreases on approaching the isotropic point but remains finite over the entire parameter range .",
    "this has the remarkable implication that the paramagnetic phase of the frustrated two dimensional spin model , including the isotropic @xmath5-@xmath3 limit , is continuously connected to the haldane spin - chain phase . in other words , the paramagnetic phase can be viewed as a continuation of the haldane spin chain phase , with the caveat that the topological string order has to disappear at any finite interchain coupling@xcite .",
    "the reason for the failure of the semiclassical sbmft in dealing correctly with the strong quantum fluctuations in the boundary region between the two classical orders is easy to understand .",
    "the sbmft deals with the spin as continuous variable while it is _ blind for the berry phase effects _ that distinguish between half - integer and integer spin values crucial for the existence of the haldane gap as well the valence bond crystals .",
    "this physics is definitely missed by the semiclassical treatment .",
    "our dmrg results demonstrates that the haldane chain phase is very robust against the simultaneous increase of the couplings @xmath1 and @xmath192 along the strongly frustrated boundary region , indicated by the minute reduction of the spin gap compared to the isolated haldane chain limit .    what does the study of this spin system teach us regarding the superconductivity in the iron pnictides",
    "one could speculate that the basic physics is similar as in the cuprates .",
    "although the spins are larger in the pnictides , the geometrical frustration renders the spin system to be on the verge of undergoing a quantum phase transition in a quantum disordered state .",
    "this quantum spin physics then sets the conditions for the emergence of superconductivity in the doped systems .",
    "but in this regard the size of the microscopic spin does matter more than one intuitively anticipates . for @xmath193 the well established fact that the berry phases conspire to turn the quantum disordered states of the spin - only systems into valence bond solids gives a rationale to take anderson s resonating valence bond ( rvb ) idea for the origin of high tc superconductivity quite seriously .",
    "the valence bonds are protected by the spin gap and the effect of doping could well be to just turn the valence bond solids into translational quantum liquids that transport two units of electrical charge .",
    "focussing on the berry phases in the pnictides one has only the options of an ` intermediate ' crystal field @xmath0 state@xcite or the high spin @xmath194 for the microscopic spin . in the former case",
    "the ground state has a twofold degeneracy and the ` building blocks ' are no longer pair singlets but instead the ` chain singlets ' . thinking along the rvb lines , what to expect when such a system is doped",
    "? the dopants will increase the quantum fluctuations but chains are not pairs .",
    "one anticipates that doping might drive the system into the non - magnetic ` haldane chain phase ' breaking the two - fold rotational symmetry of the lattice .",
    "one notices that something of the kind is found in the phase diagram of the pnictides : the structural transition to the orthorombic phase persists to much higher dopings than the stripe antiferromagnetism@xcite . at first view",
    "this seems rather detached from the rvb idea .",
    "but now one has to realize that the charge carriers are themselves spinfull , carrying by default a half - integer spin .",
    "taking for instance the intermediate @xmath0 background , the holes would carry @xmath193 , and t - j models corresponding with a mix of @xmath0 and @xmath193 states have been studied in the past@xcite .",
    "one anticipates that in an incompressible ` chain like ' @xmath0 background the @xmath193 carriers might again be ` glued by berry forces ' into valence bond pairs , re - establishing a connection with the rvb mechanism of the cuprates .",
    "a similar idea has been previously proposed from a different approach@xcite .    in conclusion , it is quite questionable that any of these considerations have a bearing on pnictide superconductivity but they do make the case that there is still much interesting physics to be explored dealing with systems characterized by a larger microscopic spin .",
