    "in recent years , novel multi - reference approaches based on the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm @xcite have been introduced into the theoretical chemical community for static quantum chemical calculations @xcite and real - time electronic wavefunction evolution @xcite .",
    "dmrg , first developed by white in 1992 , uses the eigenvalues of the subsystem s reduced density matrix as the decimation criterion of the hilbert space , and is regarded as an efficient alternative to full configuration interaction ( fci ) in quantum chemical descriptions .",
    "the computational cost of the dmrg algorithm is largely caused by the scaling of _",
    "o(k@xmath1m@xmath1 ) _ + _ o(k@xmath2m@xmath3 ) _ , where @xmath4 is the number of active space orbitals , and @xmath5 is the number of renormalized states , which usually determines the accuracy of the method @xcite .",
    "this cost is far less than that of the fci , and usually the dmrg method can deal with dozens of electrons in dozens of orbitals @xcite . considering dmrg s significant advantage of computational efficiency ,",
    "quantum chemists have successively combined it with various _ ab initio _ methodologies , such as fci @xcite , complete active space configuration interaction ( casci ) @xcite and complete active space self - consistent field ( casscf ) @xcite as well as complete active space perturbation theory ( caspt2 ) @xcite , and canonical transformation theory ( ct ) @xcite .",
    "dmrg has an innate advantage for the descriptions of one - dimensional ( 1-d ) systems , and when localized molecular orbitals ( lmos ) are used , the active space can be extended to about 100 orbitals with very good accuracy @xcite . however , there are still difficulties in the localization process for large systems when large basis sets including polarized and diffused functions are used @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "more importantly , not all of the studied systems belong to the 1-d framework , and as such , orbital localization might be inefficient . for general systems ,",
    "the hf canonical molecular orbitals ( cmos ) are often used as the basis set for dmrg - based calculations . if necessary",
    ", a further orbital optimization procedure @xcite is implemented to get more reasonable orbitals or the orbital reordering procedure by quantum information theory @xcite is performed to reduce the interaction ranges in the dmrg  sweep \" process .",
    "nevertheless , orbital optimization procedures used in the dmrg calculations mainly inherit the traditional multi - configuration self - consistent - field ( mcscf ) or casscf algorithm , wherein the orbital optimization procedure involve many  macro - iterations \" and often encounters convergence difficulties for large active spaces . in dmrg - casscf ,",
    "one macro - iteration is defined as one dmrg - casci calculation followed by orbital optimization and integral transformation ( involving about @xmath6 operations , where @xmath7 and @xmath5 represent the total orbitals and internal orbitals , respectively ) @xcite or a transformation of coulomb and exchange operators ( about @xmath8 operations ) @xcite , and the precess is usually very computationally expensive .    on the other hand , many dmrg - casscf calculations use cmos from hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations as the initial guess , but the virtual orbitals in cmos have little or no resemblance with correlated orbitals . therefore , the starting point with cmos is arbitrary , and convergence may be obtained to an undesired stationary point @xcite .",
    "in addition to cmos and lmos , natural orbitals ( nos ) , have also been introduced as the basis of dmrg - fci calculations @xcite , as well as later for dmrg - casci and dmrg - casscf calculations @xcite .",
    "nos , firstly introduced in 1955 by lwdin @xcite , can be obtained from the one - electron reduced density matrix ( 1-rdm ) and sorted by natural orbital occupation numbers ( noons ) .",
    "numerical computations @xcite show that the electron correlation effect is mainly affected by the nos with large noons , , and as such , discarding the nos with small noons could be an efficient approach to reduce the computational burden with marginal loss of accuracy . beyond their usage in truncating virtual orbitals , the adoption of nos also has important advantages in the multi - reference quantum chemistry for choosing the active space and generating starting orbitals for orbital optimization iterations",
    ". these aspects are vital in dmrg - based calculations , because the systems studied by dmrg are usually much larger and more complicated than normal systems , which can be treated by traditional multi - reference methods . a reasonable active space and an appropriate set of starting orbitals are obviously highly desired for dmrg - based calculations .",
    "however , choosing appropriate orbitals and a reasonable active space is no  black box \" task at this stage .",
    "when using nos , one can simply define an appropriate threshold for the noons to select the active space , say 0.02 - 1.98 @xcite .",
    "another more rigorous criterion has recently been introduced by landau et al .",
    "@xcite using the ratio between the cumulative occupation number and the total number of electrons , and this algorithm tends to be less sensitive to the studied systems and basis sets @xcite .",
    "since the nos are also self - optimized through the electron correlation calculation within a large or full orbital space , they can be used as a computationally cheap alternative to the optimized orbitals obtained by casscf calculations @xcite .",
    "for example , using cas(2,2 ) with a difference - dedicated configuration interaction ( ddci ) restricted to the valence @xmath9 orbitals in organic magnetic systems , one can obtain the nos of the same quality as the cas(full valence @xmath9)scf orbitals when determining magnetic couplings @xcite .",
    "actually , sometimes nos might be even more suitable than casscf - optimized orbitals for further higher - level electron correlation calculations because they inherently contain dynamic correlation information , provided they are obtained from the electron correlation calculations conducted within a large active space .    in principle , nos from high - level quantum chemical calculations can provide a more reasonable basis for dmrg - based calculations , because their electron correlation information is already very accurate .",
    "nevertheless , such high - level preliminary calculations will be obviously very expensive and sometimes unaffordable .",
    "therefore , a good compromise between the requirement for low computational costs of acquiring nos and the demand for high efficiency of nos as the basis of dmrg calculations would greatly benefit practical studies .",
    "although nos have been widely used as the basis of dmrg - based calculations in the past decade @xcite , detailed benchmark evaluations of the performances of various nos and other types of molecular orbitals in dmrg - based calculations are still absent , and the determination of the types of nos that can provide the most reasonable basis for dmrg calculations is still unknown .    in this study , we assess the efficiency of various nos used in large active space dmrg calculations through benchmark tests of dmrg - casci calculations using nos generated by unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) , configuration - interaction singles and doubles ( cisd ) , second - order mller - plesset perturbation theory ( mp2 ) , caspt2 and multi - reference configuration interaction ( mrci ) .",
    "we also list the results from hf cmos , kohn - sham mos , as well as the casscf - optimized mos .",
    "nevertheless , the nos generated by caspt2 may be limited by the size of the complete active space ; thus , a series of results using nos generated by tentative dmrg - ci calculation with moderate preserved states are also given .",
    "with moderate preserved states ( e.g. , @xmath10 500 ) , the number of active orbitals in feasible dmrg calculations can increase to about 100 .",
    "dmrg - casscf calculations are also implemented , and detailed comparisons between results of dmrg - casci and dmrg - casscf are carefully performed .",
    "the outline of this study is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , computational details are introduced ; in sec .",
    "iii , demonstrative computations of n@xmath0 , cr@xmath0 , as well as 1-d and 2-d hydrogen aggregates are presented under equilibrium and bond dissociation conditions , and finally , our results are summarized and concluded in sec .",
    "the dmrg - casci calculations and preliminary dmrg - ci calculations were implemented by the block code @xcite developed by chan s group .",
    "the nos for dmrg - casci calculations were selected according to their noons and grouped by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "if no other state , in the dmrg calculation , the orbital groups were ordered by @xmath11 , @xmath15 , @xmath12 , @xmath16 , @xmath13 , @xmath17 , @xmath14 , and @xmath18 ; and in each group the orbitals were aligned in descending order by their noons .",
    "the orbital optimization procedures in dmrg - casscf calculations were implemented by our own code , which is mainly based on the method of werner and meyer ( ref.@xcite ) , which contains not only the first- and second - order terms but also part of the higher - order terms in the independent orbital parameters @xcite .",
    "the integrals used in orbital optimization were extracted from gamess @xcite . the number of preserved states used in dmrg - casci or dmrg - casscf calculations is @xmath5=2000 unless otherwise stated .",
    "the nos from uhf , mp2 , cisd , mrci and caspt2 , as well as the ks mos , were obtained from molpro @xcite , and the no s integrals used in the block code were also obtained from molpro . however , multi - configuration perturbation theory may encounter  intruder \" problems even in the ground - state calculation due to the size of the active space in the cr@xmath0 system @xcite , and therefore , the level shift parameter @xcite is necessary to correct the zeroth - order hamiltonian . here",
    "the _ g1 _ zeroth - order hamiltonian @xcite and a level shift parameter 0.30 were used when applying the caspt2 methods to obtain the nos .",
    "herein we also exploited the dmrg - ci algorithm to generate sets of nos for further higher - level dmrg - casci calculations .",
    "first , we use the dmrg - ci to do a large active space calculations with gradually increasing @xmath5 values .",
    "second , get the natural orbitals @xmath19 according to the transform matrix u which is obtained from the dmrg - ci s 1-rdm calculations ( @xmath20 , where @xmath21 usually represents the canonical molecular orbitals ) .",
    "third , see whether the @xmath5 values were sufficient by checking the dependence of the noons on the @xmath5 values adopted in the dmrg - ci calculations .",
    "finally , if the changes in the noons were tiny or converged , one can refer to the noons to determine the active orbitals , which were then taken as the basis for the subsequent dmrg - casci calculation .",
    "a simple n@xmath22 system is taken as our first example . as a main group element , nitrogen s active space",
    "is easily defined , only choosing the valence orbitals into the active space is ideal in most cases @xcite , because the energy gap between 2p and 3s orbitals is relatively large . here",
    "we choose two different inter - molecular spacings ( 1.0@xmath23 and 3.0@xmath23 , for @xmath23=1.0976 ) , which represented equilibrium and dissociation conditions , respectively .",
    "the basis set used here was dunning s correlation consistent basis sets cc - pvtz with 60 molecular orbitals assembled from 70 atomic bases in spherical coordinates .",
    "three different active spaces were used in our dmrg - casci calculations : the first space ( space-1 ) is 14 electrons in the valence orbitals and 1s orbitals ; the second space ( space-2 ) inherits the first space and added 8 more orbitals , and admitted or rejected nos based upon their noons , or added 3s and 3p orbitals in the hf or ks mos case ; the third space ( space-3 ) follows space-2 and 10 more orbitals were added , which also based on noons or simply chose 3d orbitals in hf or ks mos cases .",
    "the dmrg - ci s nos were derived from preliminary dmrg - ci calculations with gradually increasing @xmath5 values of the full 60 mos .",
    "a part of the noons obtained using different @xmath5 values is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - no1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig - no2 ] . in the equilibrium configuration , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - no1 ] , the noons obtained by different dmrg - ci calculations with different @xmath5 values are nearly uniform .",
    "the results suggest that the hartree - fock approximation should be a good starting point for a description of this configuration , and later , the consideration of only the dynamic correlations could already give a very good correlated picture for n@xmath0 . when considering the dissociation condition , the noons obtained by dmrg - ci calculations with different @xmath5 values remarkably varied , since the non - dynamic correlations needed in this condition can not be acquired by the insufficient number of dmrg s preserved states .",
    "systems ( equilibrium ) obtained by dmrg - ci calculations . ]     systems ( dissociative ) obtained by dmrg - ci calculations . ]    after obtaining all of the nos , the dmrg - casci calculations were then implemented on the basis of the described orbital spaces .",
    "the ground - state energy results are listed in the table .",
    "[ tab - n2 ] . from the table , in the equilibrium condition , except for the hf cmos , uhf nos , kohn - sham mos , and casscf(6,6 ) optimized mos , all the other electronic correlations methods can give good sets of nos - the deviations between the results of dmrg - casci and dmrg - casscfare usually only about 1 or 2 mh , and these deviations are stable after enlarging the active spaces .",
    "the results obtained suggest that these nos are reasonable and are already very similar to the final optimized orbitals obtained by casscf or dmrg - casscf calculations .",
    "the nos from preliminary dmrg - ci calculations give a set of similar results : in space-1 ( 14e,10o ) , all of these dmrg - ci s noons support that the nos derived from 1s , 2s and 2p atomic orbitals play most important roles , and the following dmrg - casci results are also nearly identical . in the larger active space ( space-2 with 14e and 18o ) , a slightly larger deviation ( about 4 mh ) emerges between the @xmath10100 series and @xmath24200 series , and some dmrg - casci results are below those of dmrg - casscf , which are both caused by the different choices of active orbitals using noons , as indicate in the footnote of table .",
    "[ tab - n2 ] .",
    "however , deviations caused by the different choice of orbitals become very small when the active space is enlarged . in space-3 ( 14e,28o ) , although there are still diversities in choosing orbitals among different dmrg nos and mp2 , cisd etc .",
    ", the deviations among them are only 1 mh , since the noons in the higher nos will be very small , which indicates that those orbitals have marginal contributions to the correlated energy , and such , the energy changes caused from different sets of orbitals should be also inconspicuous .",
    "we can also observe that the dmrg - casci calculations with uhf nos or casscf mos display worse results in space-2(14e,18o ) and space-3(14e,28o ) than in space-1(14e,10o ) due to the lack of dynamic correlations between these two types of orbitals .",
    ".[tab - n2]calculated casscf / dmrg - casscf ground state energies ( in a.u . ) and deviations ( in a.u . ) and their deviations from dmrg - casci values in the n@xmath0 system .",
    "the cc - pvtz basis and d2h symmetry was used here . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the active orbitals are 4@xmath11 + 4@xmath13 + 4@xmath15 + 4@xmath17 .",
    "the active orbitals are 6@xmath11 + 6@xmath13 + 6@xmath15 + 6@xmath17 .",
    "8e,8o form the active space in mrci calculation .",
    "this value is estimated as the sum of the ground sate energy of dmrg - casci ( @xmath5=4000 ) and the ground state energy difference between dmrg - casci and dmrg - casscf ( @xmath5=2000 ) , since the cost of dmrg - casscf ( @xmath5=4000 ) is expensive .",
    "in this study , we investigated the performances of various nos and hf cmos , ks orbitals , as well as casscf - optimized orbitals , as the basis sets in _ ab initio _ dmrg - casci calculations with large active space and compare them with dmrg - casscf calculations .",
    "we observed that caspt2 and mrci nos always gives reasonable basis sets for further higher - level dmrg - casci calculations provided that a reasonable active space for the caspt2 and mrci calculations .",
    "the deviations of dmrg - casci energies using caspt2 nos from dmrg - casscf results are less than 4 @xmath25 in our n@xmath0 and cr@xmath0 systems under both near - equilibrium and dissociation conditions .",
    "simultaneously , single - reference cisd nos also provide good basis sets for further higher - level dmrg - casci calculations utilizing sufficiently large active spaces , because such dmrg - casci calculations can recover static correlations that are poorly described by cisd .",
    "the nos generated from the dmrg - ci calculations are invariably reasonable , provided the number of preserved states @xmath5 is sufficiently large . when the multi - reference character is not strong , a small number of preserved states ( eg .",
    "@xmath5=100 ) usually provide a good set of nos for our test systems ; while under the bond dissociation situation , much more preserved states are needed to recover the static correlations .",
    "for example in the n@xmath0 system , only @xmath5 = 500 leads to a result better than derived that from caspt2 nos .",
    "however , it is not necessary to use dmrg - ci to generate nos for high - level dmrg - casci calculations in most cases , since the computational costs of the dmrg algorithm usually exceeds those of traditional electron correlation methods , such as mp2 and cisd as well as the caspt2 .",
    "here we should also mention that the nos from dmrg - ci may lose orbital degeneracy because of the insufficiently preserved states and also the  sweep \" process in dmrg calculations . if necessary , this can be corrected by the dmrg - casscf procedure with a few macro - iterations ( typically 1@xmath262 , since the orbitals are already optimized in the moderate dmrg - ci level ) .",
    "however , it is worth noting that a priori dmrg - ci calculations are mandatory when the multi - reference character is very strong ( for example , in our 1-d and 2-d hydrogen polyradical system ) . in such case , describing static correlations requires an active space composed of more than 20 orbitals , which is far beyond the capability of current casscf or caspt2 method .",
    "only the dmrg - ci can provide significantly more reasonable natural orbitals than mp2 , cisd , caspt2 , and mrci .",
    "our results reveal that a good compromise between the requirement for low computational costs of acquiring nos and the demand for high efficiency of nos as the basis of dmrg calculations may be differ according to the studied systems diverse electron correlation characteristics and the size of the active space . for dmrg calculations with medium - sized active spaces , quantum chemical methods like caspt2 and mrci which can well account for static and dynamic electron correlations , are necessary to generate the no basis set .",
    "when the active space becomes sufficiently large , quantum chemical methods such as cisd , which can efficiently describe dynamic electron correlations , are sufficient to produce reasonable no basis for dmrg calculations . as for cases with very strong multi - reference characters that involves more than 17 unpaired electrons , preliminary dmrg - ci calculations are preferable for obtaining more reasonable nos for further higher - level dmrg - based calculations .",
    "such findings may provide useful guidance for the selection of suitable quantum chemical method to generate reasonable nos as the basis for subsequent large - scale dmrg - based calculations of different types of systems .",
    "our results also show that dmrg - casci calculations from a basis of suitable nos can obtain high accuracies , which are comparable to those of dmrg - casscf calculation .",
    "this strategy can overcome the disadvantage of traditional dmrg - casscf ( i.e. , the convergence difficulty ) and reduce the computational costs in  macro - iterations \" .",
    "actually , the  three stages \" dmrg - scf strategy proposed by zgid and nooijen @xcite , in which dmrg calculations are performed with a gradually increasing small _ m _ value during orbital optimization , can also remarkably decrease the computational load compared to the standard dmrg - casscf calculations .",
    "the two preconditions required for this  three stages \" dmrg - scf strategy , no convergence problem and inexpensive integral transformation , can not always be fulfilled for complicated systems with very large active spaces .",

    "<S> it is well - known that not only the orbital ordering but also the choice of the orbitals themselves as the basis may significantly influence the computational efficiency of density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations . in this study , for assessing the efficiency of using various natural orbitals ( nos ) as the dmrg basis , we performed benchmark dmrg calculations with different bases , which included the nos obtained by various traditional electron correlation methods , as well as nos acquired from preliminary moderate dmrg calculations ( e.g. , preserved states less than 500 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the tested systems included n@xmath0 , transition metal cr@xmath0 systems , as well as 1-d hydrogen polyradical chain systems under equilibrium and dissociation conditions and 2-d hydrogen aggregates . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate that a good compromise between the requirement for low computational costs of acquiring nos and the demand for high efficiency of nos as the basis of dmrg calculations may be very dependent on the studied systems diverse electron correlation characteristics and the size of the active space . it is also shown that a dmrg - complete active space configuration interaction ( dmrg - casci ) calculation in a basis of carefully chosen nos can provide a less expensive alternative to the standard dmrg - casscf calculation and avoid the convergence difficulties of orbital optimization for large active spaces . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of different no ordering schemes on dmrg - casci calculations is also discussed . </S>"
