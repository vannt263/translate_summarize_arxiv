    "one of the important problems in the gravitational theories is finding solutions under the assumption of spatial isotropy and time independence , i.e. static spherically symmetric solutions .",
    "then the results can be used to treat the solar system tests and also for computing the pressure , density and gravitational field within a spherically symmetric static star . regarding the standard general relativity",
    ", there is a large number of exact solutions of einstein s field equations for perfect spherically symmetric static fluids in the literatures . for a complete list see @xcite . from these solutions which are in closed algebraic form ,",
    "only eleven solutions satisfy physical criteria mentioned in @xcite and therefore are physically acceptable .",
    "( nine solutions in @xcite , one in @xcite and one in @xcite ) .    a particular class of gravitational theories which has been received great interest recently , is @xmath0 modified theories of gravity @xcite . in @xcite",
    "spherically symmetric vacuum solutions of @xmath0 theories are studied . in particular",
    "it is shown that the modified gravitational theories have the general static blackhole solutions with non - vanishing cosmological constant , schwarzschild ",
    ". considering scalar  tensor theories of gravity in the einstein frame ,",
    "a reconstruction method is introduced in @xcite to generate some spherically symmetric vacuum space  times .",
    "since @xmath0 gravity is dynamically equivalent to brans - dicke theory with zero coupling constant , this method is applicable to @xmath0 gravity in the einstein frame .",
    "also in the recent years some exact solutions for static spherically symmetric perfect fluid in @xmath0 theory of gravity are presented @xcite .",
    "since the field equations of @xmath0 theory are differential equations of fourth order , more integration constants need to be determined in order to get a unique solution .",
    "this shows that in general , the exterior space - time geometry is not described only by the mass of the star , and thus the validity of birkhoff theorem is lost@xcite .",
    "other details of mass distribution , i.e. the gravitational multipole moments , are needed to obtain a unique solution for both interior and exterior regions of a star . as a result",
    "the exterior solutions of @xmath0 theory are not necessarily asymptotically flat .",
    "another issue related to the star evolution is the singularity problem in @xmath0 gravity which has been first introduced in @xcite and then disscused for stellar configurations in @xcite which maybe treated by adding higher powers of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the classification of future singularities according to their properties into four classes is studied in @xcite .",
    "these singularities occur in scalar or fluid models of dark energy and in @xmath0 or @xmath3 ( g denotes the gauss- bonnet invariant ) @xcite or other models leading to an accelerating universe .",
    "the fact that all such singularities is not unique for @xmath0 but occur in all known dark energy models is explained in @xcite .",
    "moreover the consistency condition of any @xmath0 theory with the solar system tests is the occurrence of the chameleon mechanism @xcite .",
    "it is one way to avoid the doglov  kawaski instability @xcite .",
    "also a positive value of @xmath4 is needed to guarantee the positivity of the effective gravitational constant @xmath5 @xcite .    in @xcite , by considering the lagrangian of the form of @xmath6 , two exact spherically symmetric vacuum solutions are presented which do not have the asymptotic behavior of the minkowski space - time .",
    "it seems that the non - existence of asymptotic flatness is one of the reasons to study weather @xmath0 theory can explain the flat rotation curve of galaxies or not @xcite .",
    "moreover @xmath0 static spherically symmetric solution for stellar systems has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the authors show that specifying the pressure and the density of matter do not uniquely determine the functional form of @xmath0 . as mentioned before , this is because of appearing higher order derivatives of quantities in the equations which require matching of higher order derivatives of variables at the surface of star .",
    "it is shown that assuming schwartzschild ",
    "desitter metric outside the mass distribution as a boundary condition , induces tight constraints on the quantities@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the gravitational equations of @xmath0 theory for the interior of a spherically symmetric matter distribution and derive a few new solutions in some closed algebraic form . for these solutions",
    ", the dependence of @xmath0 function to the scalar curvature can be found .",
    "we divide these solutions into two groups . after analyzing each metric",
    ", we see that one of the obtained metrics is appropriate for describing a star . at the end",
    ", we consider this solution in more detail and match it to the corresponding exterior metric solution .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath0 theory can be determined by the following action : @xmath7 in the metric approach , the gravitational field equations can be obtained via the variation of action with respect to metric : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter and @xmath10 . considering a static and spherically symmetric distribution of matter ,",
    "the line element has the following form : @xmath11 and assuming the matter to be described by a perfect fluid , we have : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the proper mass density and the isotropic pressure of the fluid in the instantaneous rest frame of the fluid and @xmath15 is its four velocity . substituting ( [ ds ] ) and ( [ t ] ) in ( [ fr ] ) , one obtains the static spherically symmetric field equations of @xmath0 theory with matter . assuming a specific form of @xmath0 , these equations would be three fourth order nonlinear differential equations . supplementing by an equation of state for matter : @xmath16 one has a complete set of equations for four unknown quantities , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . to carry out the calculation , it is desirable to re - express the equations in a somewhat different form @xcite",
    ". it can be shown that the expression : @xmath21}=\\frac{fr_{\\mu\\mu}-\\nabla_\\mu\\nabla_\\mu f-\\kappa t_{\\mu\\mu}}{g_{\\mu\\mu}}\\ ] ] with no summation on repeated indices , is independent of the index @xmath22 . from @xmath23}-k_{[r]}=0",
    "$ ] , we have : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and a prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "also @xmath23}-k_{[\\theta]}=0 $ ] results in : @xmath27 furthermore , from the conservation equation of energy momentum tensor , one obtains : @xmath28 and also the corresponding curvature scalar is given by : @xmath29 \\label{r}\\ ] ] equations ( [ state ] ) , ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) , ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ r ] ) completely determine the unknown quantities @xmath17 , @xmath30 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath2 .",
    "these are the relativistic equations of stellar structure in @xmath0 theory of gravity .    from a mathematical point of view , knowing the functional form of @xmath0 , equation ( [ r ] ) shows that the functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 depend on @xmath33 and @xmath34 in a complicated and non - linear manner . therefore we can not expect to obtain the analytical solutions of equations ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) in a closed form . although one could use the numerical @xcite or approximate methods such as the newtonian approximation @xcite or perturbation method @xcite . in the newtonian limit , assuming a polytropic equation of state of matter , @xmath35 , these equations lead to a modified version of poisson and lan  emden equations@xcite .    here",
    "we are interested in obtaining some analytical solutions in a different way . in order to do this ,",
    "we follow tolman s method @xcite which is developed to provide a variety of explicit solutions of einstein s equations for a static sphere of fluid .",
    "assuming matter is represented by a perfect fluid , instead of using the equation of the state of matter , tolman introduces a relation for the metric components or their dependence to radial coordinate , in order to solve the set of equations easily .",
    "of course , it must be noted that this procedure leads to some expression for the density and the pressure of the perfect fluid which may not be physically acceptable for a star @xcite .    for @xmath0 equations ,",
    "it is necessary to consider two assumptions .",
    "one is the equation of the state of the fluid and the other is the form of @xmath0 . logically these two assumptions should be given to have a completely defined model .",
    "we should do this in another way .",
    "two relations for @xmath30 and @xmath36 are proposed and then the equations are solved . as a byproduct of the solution , the equation of state and @xmath0 are obtained .",
    "however it has to be noted here that not all solutions lead to physically acceptable equation of state and also that not for all solutions it is practical to obtain the form of @xmath0 analytically .    in this paper",
    "we discuss two kinds of assumptions : @xmath37 , @xmath38 ( class i ) and @xmath39 , @xmath38 ( class ii ) where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are arbitrary constants . for any choice",
    ", a number of interesting solutions for @xmath17 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 along with the corresponding forms of @xmath0 are obtained . to specify the integration constants",
    ", one must specify the boundary conditions . for a star in equilibrium , it is physical to assume that the pressure drops from its central value to zero at the surface of star , @xmath44 .",
    "moreover the metric needs to be matched with the outside vacuum solution at the surface of the star , according to the israel junction conditions .",
    "a look at equations ( [ 1])([3 ] ) , suggests that choosing @xmath45 simplifies the equations .",
    "then on choosing @xmath38 and combining equations ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) we have @xmath46 with the general solution @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 and @xmath50 is a constant .",
    "finally equations ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) leads to @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is a constant , and also @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56    in addition one can simply see that @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59    although these are exact solutions of the @xmath0 equations , but the form of @xmath0 only can be reconstructed for special choices of @xmath42 .",
    "these are listed in table([t1 ] ) .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t2 ]    solution iv gives a negative sound velocity squared and thus is not acceptable .",
    "solutions ii , iii , and v are acceptable for a thick shell . again",
    "israel junction conditions should be applied on it to have a complete solution .",
    "finally solution i , with some values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 gives a physical acceptable solution for a star .",
    "a look at tables ( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ t2 ] ) , shows that only the solution i of table ( [ t2 ] ) is appropriate for a star . to have a physical sphere of fluid surrounded by empty space , we set @xmath60 , so that the energy density and pressure decrease in a monotonic way with decreasing @xmath26 , and the equation of state can be written as : @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "moreover in spite of obtaining infinite values for central density and pressure at @xmath63 , they are positive definite provided that @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the pressure vanishes at the surface of the star @xmath67 , and thus @xmath68 .",
    "we have to have subluminal speed of sound and thus @xmath69 and thus @xmath70 .",
    "solution i specialize us to power law lagrangian plus a cosmological constant . since @xmath0 models are of interest because of the fact that they can explain the late  time acceleration of the universe without the need for a cosmological constant , we set @xmath71 .",
    "fortunately , for this case in the absence of cosmological constant , there are two spherically symmetric vacuum static solutions in the literature .",
    "one is proposed in @xcite and another is given by @xcite .",
    "therefore one can consider the matching of the interior metric to each of these forms of the exterior solutions at the surface of the sphere .",
    "here we take the first choice .",
    "the exterior solution is thus@xcite : @xmath72 @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a constant , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 is subject to some constraints .",
    "the existence of chameleon  like mechanism ( named by @xcite so , to denote that the chameleon behavior in the jordan frame differs slightly from the einstein frame . )",
    ", light deflection experiment and the perihelion precession of mercury leads to the following bound on @xmath42 @xcite : @xmath78    using the exterior solution ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) and the interior solution i of table ( [ t2 ] ) , the junction conditions given by the equations ( [ j1])([j3 ] ) , would be simplified into : @xmath79 @xmath80\\ ] ] @xmath81 the first two equations determine the constants @xmath82 and @xmath74 in terms of @xmath44 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , while the third equation can be used to find @xmath43 in terms of @xmath42 . it can be solved exactly and there are two solutions : @xmath83 and @xmath84 it has to be noted that only the ratio @xmath85 is fixed according to the relation given in table ( [ t2 ] ) . therefore given a specific form of @xmath0 which fixes @xmath41 , one gets the constant @xmath86 . for @xmath87",
    "one can simply see that @xmath88 and this wipes out the star solution . for @xmath89",
    "we find : @xmath90 also @xmath53 can be derived from the definition of @xmath44 as : @xmath91    as stated before , to have subluminal sound velocity we have to have @xmath70 .",
    "the acceptable values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 are plotted in figure ( [ f1 ] ) . also taking into account the bound given by equation ( [ b ] )",
    "we see that values of @xmath42 are very small and thus : @xmath92    the last two junction conditions ( [ j4 ] ) and ( [ j5 ] ) determine the surface energy  momentum tensor .",
    "equation ( [ j5 ] ) gives : @xmath93 while equation ( [ j4 ] ) simplifies to : @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 is the energy density and @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the tension densities on the star surface .",
    "in this paper we found some static spherically symmetric interior solutions of @xmath0 theory of gravity .",
    "of the eleven solutions , listed in table ( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ t2 ] ) , only one solution is physically acceptable for a star . in obtaining the solutions , we restricted ourselves to the solutions which have two properties .",
    "first , they are in the closed form and are obtained without any numerical or approximation method for solving the coupled high order differential equations of @xmath0 theory .",
    "second , the corresponding form of @xmath0 function can be reconstructed .",
    "this means that we have not reported those solutions for which there are algebraic relations for @xmath100 and @xmath101 , without the possibility for solving them to get @xmath0 .",
    "special attention is paid to the star solution , and it is matched to existing exterior solution and thus as a result one has a complete solution for a star and its exterior region for power law @xmath0 theories .",
    "the junction conditions are applied on this star solution and the acceptable values of the constants are derived .",
    "it has to be noted that we are not able to apply the junction conditions for our thick shell solutions .",
    "this is because of the fact that we do not know the exterior solution for such @xmath0 s .",
    "moreover those forms of @xmath0 are not of physical interest .",
