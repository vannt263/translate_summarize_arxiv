    "chains of nonlinear interacting particles have been of large interest since a long time and a variety of interesting effects occurring in those systems has been described , such as solitons , ( e.g.  @xcite ) , energy localization ( e.g.  @xcite ) , etc . in the context of granular materials chains of inelastically colliding particles have been investigated as model systems for shaken granular material ( e.g.  @xcite ) , granular compaction  @xcite , the `` inelastic collapse '' ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the kinetic theory of one - dimensional granular systems has been addressed in @xcite .    in this paper",

    "[ fig : sketch ]    one can easily study the chains of ideally elastic spheres and of spheres interacting via a constant coefficient of restitution .",
    "it is much more complicated to deal with chains of of viscoelastic particles , which have an impact velocity dependent coefficient and which , as we show below , exhibit quite unexpected behavior . it has been demonstrated recently that the kinetic properties of `` thermodynamically - large '' systems of viscoelastic particles differ significantly from those of particles interacting with constant coefficient of restitution  @xcite .",
    "the system considered in this paper may serve as an example of a _ small _ system which properties change qualitatively when the viscoelastic properties of the particles are taken into account explicitly .    in the present study the problem of the most efficient energy transmission in a chain of particles of variable mass",
    "is addressed .",
    "we analyze the optimal distribution for the particle masses and calculate the optimal size of the system .",
    "the textbook problem of elastic collisions may serve us to introduce the notation .",

    "straightforward generalization of the previous analysis for the case of the dissipative collisions with a constant coefficient of restitution @xmath2 shows that the optimal mass distribution is identical to that for the elastic case ( [ 5 ] ) .",

    "we will consider particles which interact via a velocity dependent coefficient of restitution . since the velocity of the particles varies for the particles of the chain we characterize the dissipation of the colliding spheres not by the coefficient of restitution itself but rather we define a dissipative constant @xmath36 . for the case of a constant coefficient @xmath2 it is defined as @xmath37 .",

    "we treat the part of energy which is not transformed from the first particle of the chain to the last one as a `` lost '' energy . in this sense",
    "the energy is `` lost '' according to two mechanisms : first , due to mismatch of subsequent masses , which causes incomplete transfer of momentum even for elastic collision when the masses differ ( this part of the energy loss is called `` inertial '' ) .",
    "the second refers to the dissipative nature of collisions and , therefore , this loss is called `` viscous '' below .",
    "the inertial loss in the collision , attributed to the energy transfer to the @xmath27-th particle is thus given by the energy which remains in the @xmath69-rst particle after the collision : @xmath70 for long enough chains we approximate the discrete mass distribution by a continuous one , @xmath71 .",
    "this , with the assumption of small mass gradients , gives @xmath72 , where we assume that particles are separated on a line by a unit distance . within the continuum picture @xmath73 , and we write for the `` line - density '' of the inertial loss , discarding high - order mass gradients : @xmath74    viscous losses describe the energy losses according to the inelastic properties of the material , therefore , they are equal to the difference of the kinetic energy of a particle after an _ elastic _ collision ( with no dissipation ) and that after a _ dissipative _ collision .",

    "the solution of the _ first - order _ equation ( [ eqy2 ] ) may be found straightforwardly .",
    "the general solution is somewhat lengthy , but for the case of @xmath34 ( one can always use the appropriate mass unit ) , this reads ( for @xmath99 ) :    @xmath100    where @xmath101 the value of the constant @xmath93 may be found from the second boundary condition @xmath102 , which yields a transcendental equation for @xmath93 :    @xmath103    the last equation has to be solved numerically .",

    "( [ eqy ] ) .",
    "note , that some scaling properties of the solution may be deduced just from the form of ( [ eqy ] ) .",
    "namely , as it follows from this equation , the solution should depend on the reduced length variable @xmath104 .",
    "thus , the distribution of masses for chains with different chain length @xmath14 and different dissipative constant @xmath36 should coincide after rescaling the particle numbers as @xmath105 , provided masses @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the same for these chains .",
    "we will consider the scaling properties of the mass distribution in more detail latter .",

    "one can give a simple physical explanation of appearance of maximum in mass distribution ( and correspondingly minimum in the velocity distribution ) : as it is seen from eq .",
    "( [ epsviab ] ) the restitution coefficient increases with decreasing impact velocity and increasing masses of colliding particles ; this reduces the viscous losses .",
    "thus slowing down particles , by increasing their masses in the inner part of the chain , leads to decrease of the viscous losses of the energy transfer .",
    "the larger the masses in the middle and the smaller their velocities , the less energy is lost due to dissipation . on the other hand , since masses @xmath12 and @xmath13 are fixed , very large masses in the middle of the chain will cause large mass mismatch of the subsequent masses and thus large inertial losses [ see eq .",
    "( [ ein1 ] ) ] . the optimal mass distribution , minimizing the _ total _ losses compromises ( dictated by @xmath36 ) between these two opposite tendencies .",
    "for the case of a constant coefficient of restitution the relative part of the kinetic energy , which is lost due to dissipation does not depend on the impact velocity .",
    "this means that only minimization of the inertial losses , caused by mass gradient , may play role in optimization of the mass distribution .",
    "thus only a monotonous mass distribution with minimal mass gradients along the chain may be observed as an optimal one for the case of the constant restitution coefficient .    [",

    ", @xmath13 fixed ) the mass gradient of adjacent particles is large , hence inertia losses are large as well .",
    "for very long chains viscous losses become large .",

    "[ fig : vendepsonv ]    having the mass distribution and the velocity distribution obtained from the numerical optimization one can check directly the validity of the `` ideal chain ansatz '' , @xmath84 , used in the variational approach . in fig .",
    "[ fig : optimansatz ] we compare @xmath81 obtained by optimization with that from the ansatz . as it is seen from the figure , the ideal chain ansatz occurs to be rather accurate for small dissipation parameter @xmath36 , and for the initial part of the chain .",
    "it demonstrates , however , noticeable deviations from the optimization data for larger @xmath36 , especially at the end of the chain , i.e. for @xmath107 .",
    "this is not surprising since it uses an assumption of complete transmission of energy , which is definitely poor for the very end of the chain . on the other hand , as it follows from figs .",
    "[ fig : manalnuma ] and [ fig : manalnum ] , this ansatz yields rather accurate results , when applied to the mass distribution problem .",
    "the possible explanation for this follows from the boundary condition for the mass distribution at the end of the chain , @xmath108 .",

    "we observed that our variational theory agrees well with the results of the numerical optimization for the mass distribution , provided the dissipative material parameter is not too large .",
    "we also performed a direct verification of the basic approximation used in our variational approach .    from the exact solution of the variational equation we obtained an analytical expression which relates the heaviest mass in the mass distribution to the chain length and the dissipation constant .",

    "it has been demonstrated before that for the case of `` thermodynamically - large '' granular systems the impact - velocity dependence of the restitution coefficient , as it is given for viscoelastic particles , may lead to qualitatively different behavior as compared to systems with a constant restitution coefficient , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the system investigated here may serve as an example of the major influence of the velocity dependence of the restitution coefficient even for relatively small ( `` lab - scale '' ) and simple systems .",
