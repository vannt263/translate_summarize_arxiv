    "if you look at the results for the prime numbers , you will see that multiplication by 2 gives a new sequence with its own description : even numbers that are a product of two primes . at the same time adding one to the prime numbers gives a sequence that is described in terms of this exact operation : primes plus 1 .",

    "the resulting sequence keeps most of the properties of the fibonacci sequence . in some sense ,",

    "we use base ten mostly because we have 10 fingers on our hands .",
    "if we had 14 fingers , the reverse operation would have had a very different result .",
    "for this reason , many mathematicians feel that the reversing operation is not a mathematical operation , and should nt be considered interesting or worth looking at .",
    "this is the same reason why non - base related submissions to the oeis database are more encouraged than base related submissions . at the same time , there are many sequences in the database that are base - related and people continue submitting them .",
    "one thing in favor of such sequences is that they often have very short and simple descriptions .",
    "i find sequences that can be described in two words very appealing .",

    "3 .   the growth rate for these two sequences can be easily approximated .",
    "indeed , if @xmath41 describes the growth rate of @xmath1 , then @xmath42 describes the growth rate of @xmath43 ; and it is very easy to plug the square function into the growth rates for the prime numbers and the fibonacci numbers .",
    "a sequence can be viewed as a function from positive integers to integers .",
    "vice versa , any function on integers , when restricted to the positive integers , forms a sequence .",

    "as we ve seen before , composition with the natural numbers does nt change the sequence .",
    "that is , the natural number sequence acts as the identity for this operation .",
    "the composition of sequences procedure is very similar to the two previous procedures : function acting on a sequence element and function acting on an index . to look at this similarity in more detail ,",
    "let us start with two sequences @xmath1 and @xmath17 and correspond to them two functions on positive integers : @xmath10 and @xmath41 .",

    "if the sequence @xmath17 is not positive , we still can have a function acting on it . in this sense ,",
    "a function acting on a sequence is a more general operation than the composition of two sequences .",
    "but for positive sequences , both a function acting on a sequence element and a function acting on an index are the same procedure as the composition of two sequences .",
    "* self - composition : * for this special case , let @xmath48 , then @xmath49 :    * if @xmath1 are the natural numbers , then @xmath50 is : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , @xmath0 a000027 : the natural numbers . * if @xmath1 are the prime numbers , then @xmath50 is : 3 , 5 , 11 , 17 , 31 , 41 , 59 , 67 , 83 , 109 , 127 , 157 , @xmath0 a006450 : primes with prime subscripts .",

    "is there anything else ?",
    "one can hope that if two sequences are related to each other their composition might be an exciting sequence . a sequence is definitely related to itself ",
    "is this enough ? obviously , the self - composition ca nt be equally interesting for every sequence .",
    "what kinds of sequences allow the self - composition to produce something special ?",
    "are the prime numbers and the fibonacci numbers the best choices to plug into the self - composition ?",
    "i am not sure .",

    "i find this sequence very interesting .",
    "as i mentioned before , the sequence of natural numbers acts as the identity under the composition operation .",
    "when we have an operation with an identity we usually try to define an inverse object . for many mathematical operations the inverse is unique , or in the worst case there are two inverses : left and right . with sequences",
    "everything is worse than the worst case .",
    "we will see that the inverses are not always defined and there can be many of them .",
    "let us try to bring some order to this chaos of compositional inverses of sequences .",
    "we can start with standard definitions for left and right inverses .",

    "correspondingly , a right inverse sequence is denoted as @xmath55 , and it satisfies the property that the composition sequence @xmath56 is the natural numbers sequence .",
    "it goes without saying that the sequences @xmath54 and @xmath55 depend on the sequence @xmath4 .",
    "i will sometimes use the notation @xmath57 and @xmath58 in cases where i need this dependency to be explicit .",
    "* left inverse . *",
    "first we assume that @xmath1 is positive .",

    "if @xmath1 does nt reach a number @xmath59 for any index @xmath2 , then @xmath60 could be any number .",
    "that is , in this case the left inverse is nt defined uniquely . from here , we see that we can define the left inverse uniquely only if @xmath1 is a permutation of natural numbers and in this case the left inverse sequence is the reverse permutation",
    ".    many of the interesting sequences are increasing . to be able to define a left inverse for an increasing sequence , we need this sequence not to take the same value for different indices .",
    "this requirement translates into a simple condition : our increasing sequence has to be strictly increasing .",
    "suppose @xmath1 is a strictly increasing sequence . in this case",
    "the left inverse sequence can be defined .",
    "it still might not be unique , or more precisely , it is guaranteed not to be unique unless @xmath4 is the sequence of natural numbers .",
    "each time the left inverse is not unique we have infinitely many left inverses .",
    "to enjoy some order in this chaos of left inverses i would like to restrict candidates for the left inverse to non - decreasing sequences . in this case",
    "we can define two special left inverse sequences : @xmath61 and @xmath62 , called the minimal left inverse and the maximal left inverse correspondingly .",
    "we define them so that for any non - decreasing sequence @xmath17 , such that @xmath17 is a left inverse of @xmath1 , the following equations are true : @xmath63 .",
    "it is easy to see that the @xmath64 is the number of elements in @xmath1 that are less than or equal to @xmath2 .",
    "also the @xmath65 is the number of elements in @xmath1 that are less than @xmath2 , plus 1 .",
    "in particular , @xmath66 equals 0 if @xmath2 belongs to @xmath1 and 1 otherwise . from here",
