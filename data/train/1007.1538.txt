    "the value @xmath13 has the meaning of the adiabatic sound velocity ( at @xmath14const ) .",
    "namely , this quantity characterizes propagation of sound waves in ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "as we show below , in non - ideal hydrodynamics at a finite value of the thermal conductivity , @xmath15 , the propagation of sound waves is defined by the interplay between @xmath16 ( at @xmath17const ) and @xmath13 .",
    "conditions @xmath18 and @xmath19 define @xmath20-curves : the its line ( at fixed temperature @xmath4 ) and as line ( at fixed @xmath21 ) , respectively .",

    "calculations performed in mean field models show that @xmath27 . in refs .",
    "@xcite and numerous subsequent works , crossing of the as line by effective trajectories @xmath21=const was considered as the starting point for the multifragmentation following an adiabatic expansion of the system .",
    "in contrast , in ref .",
    "@xcite and later refs .",
    "@xcite it was assumed that the multifragmentation may appear already at higher temperatures , when the its curve is crossed by the @xmath21=const lines .",
    "the argumentation of the former group of works can be traced back to the fact that in ideal hydrodynamics instabilities indeed arise at the as boundary ( see extensive discussions in ref .",
    "isothermal instabilities at first order phase transitions were studied in details in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in mean field theories , difference between values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 is usually rather large .",

    "@xcite @xmath29  mev for hqgp phase transition .",
    "note that simultaneously with the low value @xmath30  mev a sufficiently high value of @xmath31 should be reached .",
    "this looks unlikely to be achieved in heavy - ion collisions . hence ,",
    "if instability occurs for @xmath32 , one could face difficulties in exploring the hqgp spinodal instabilities in actual experiments with heavy ions .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that above mentioned difference of @xmath22 and @xmath23 is probably an artifact of the mean field approximation and both values of the critical temperature should coincide provided thermal fluctuation effects are included .",
    "indeed , it is known ( e.g. , see  ref .",
    "@xcite ) , that inclusion of fluctuations may result in a weak divergence of the specific heat .",
    "for example , for the three - dimensional ising universality class @xmath33^{-\\alpha}$ ] , where @xmath34 . it can be concluded from eq .",
    "( [ uc ] ) , that for divergent @xmath9 both temperatures @xmath35 and @xmath36 should coincide .",
    "although this observation is fully true , it seems legitimate to rise some questions .",
    "* first , thermal fluctuation effects are strong enough only in a critical region , where the mean field theory breaks down and system properties are governed by non - trivial critical exponents .",
    "for many systems the critical region is a rather narrow region near the critical point , while contrary examples are known as well @xcite .",
    "although it is not known a priori how large is the hqgp critical region , there is an indication in favor of the hqgp critical region being small  @xcite . only if the system trajectory passes trough the critical region , one can hope that fluctuation effects appearing during evolution of the system may lead to @xmath37 . *",
    "second , even if the system trajectory passes through the critical region and @xmath35 coincide with @xmath36 , the its and the as lines may not collapse into one line even within the critical region because the fluctuation contribution to the specific heat diverges only at the critical point and then sharply decreases .",
    "thus we should understand crossing of which of two lines ( the its or as line ) results in the spinodal instability . *",
    "third , the divergence of @xmath9 at the critical point is due to long - scale fluctuations , which need a long time to develop . therefore the time , which the system spends in a vicinity of the critical point in the course of the heavy ion collision , might be insufficient for the developing of such fluctuations , see discussions in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "moreover , if the initial collision energy is such that the system trajectory passes outside the critical region , i.e. entirely in the mean field regime , the thermal fluctuation effects do not contribute at all .",
    "then the question arises how one can treat the problem purely within the mean field approximation .",
    "this is actually an important question , since most of equations of state used in the description of heavy ion collisions disregard the fluctuation effects .    in refs .",
    "@xcite we focused on the study of dynamical effects of the viscosity and the surface tension .",
    "the aim of the given paper is to consider the influence of thermal conductivity effects on the dynamics of first - order phase transitions and to answer above risen questions .",
    "below we find out that in non - ideal hydrodynamics ( with non - zero thermal conductivity , @xmath38 ) instabilities show up at the crossing of the its line and only for @xmath1 , e.g. in ideal hydrodynamics , they appear at the as line .",
