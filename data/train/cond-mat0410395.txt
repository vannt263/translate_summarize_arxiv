    "the enumeration of graphs contributing to @xmath41 can be made easier by noticing that these graphs can be formed by combination of smaller graphs .",
    "we define an articulation point @xcite as a point on @xmath48-axis such that the tree above is an allowed spiral tree in the quadrant above that part ( note that these trees are defined in the upper quadrant and they never touch @xmath37 axis , except at ( 0,0 ) ) .",
    "for example , the solid squares represent the articulation points of the graph in fig .",
    "[ backb ] , and fig.[ni ] shows a spiral tree with no articulation point .",
    "hence , these spiral trees can be seen as trees having @xmath48 axis as a backbone on which spiral graphs are connected at different articulation points maintaining the spiral constraint .",
    "let @xmath49 be the generating function of the quadrant spiral trees with no articulation points .",
    "hence @xmath49 can be seen as sum of generating function of irreducible graphs with @xmath50 sites along @xmath48-axis .",
    "we represent them by @xmath51 ( see fig .",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "one can write @xmath57 with some effort but we do not have a general form for @xmath51 for any @xmath50 .",
    "we restrict the graphs contributing to @xmath51 to be graphs such that they have @xmath50 sites along the @xmath48 axis and have at least one downward branch with @xmath58 sites .",
    "this would not include structures like fig .",

    "we enumerated @xmath68 and using them we could generate a @xmath69 term series for @xmath59 .",
    "the computation time for @xmath68 grows as @xmath70 , in contrast to @xmath71 for the @xmath67 series .",
    "if we restrict the graphs contributing to @xmath51 , @xmath61 and @xmath60 to the graphs having comb - like structure ( by comb - like structure we mean graphs with one dimensional backbone having vertical straight lines of arbitrary lengths ) , then it turns out that one can get the exact expression for these generating functions .",

    "since this counts only a subset of all the spiral trees on a square lattice , this is a rigorous lower bound on @xmath24 for spiral trees on a square lattice .    for the full @xmath59 , we derived a 56 term series .",
    "if we assume ,    @xmath82    then we got estimates of @xmath83 and @xmath84 to be    @xmath85      since the number of configurations of a given cluster size is exponential in cluster size , the computational complexity of the algorithm for enumeration of all lattice animals or trees grows exponentially with the cluster size . for direct enumeration algorithms like martin s algorithm @xcite",

    ", we are restricted to clusters of size thirty seven in two dimensions .",
    "the main problem is with the extrapolation since the crossover sizes are likely to be large , as the total angle turned by the largest spiral arm about the origin for a spiral tree of size @xmath129 is about @xmath130 only ( fig . [ 2dmc ] ) .",

    "but with spiral constraint , algorithms involving large scale non local moves are not useful .",
    "we used an improved version of incomplete enumeration algorithm proposed recently by us @xcite . using it we could study spiral trees of sizes up to one thousand on a square lattice .",
    "incomplete enumeration is a simple modification of exact enumeration algorithm and can be seen as a percolation process on the genealogical tree of the underlying enumeration problem .",
    "the optimal behaviour of the algorithm is achieved when we work around the percolation threshold of the genealogical tree .",
    "this algorithm falls in the class of stochastic growth algorithm like perm @xcite .",
    "we have shown in @xcite , that the asymptotic time to produce an independent sample of @xmath20 sites for trees and animals grows as @xmath132 with @xmath133 for this algorithm . though the coefficient in front of stretched exponential can be made small by optimising the algorithm for small sizes .",
    "we will not give more details of the algorithm in this paper .",
    "these can be found in @xcite .",
    "fig.[2dmc ] shows pictures of some typical spiral trees of one thousand sites .",
    "clearly , their structure is very different from lattice trees without the spiral constraint .",
    "because of the constraint they tend to branch much less . for spiral constraint ,",
    "earlier numerical evidence suggest that unlike lattice trees and animals , spiral trees and animals do not lie in same universality class .",
    "the reason is that by allowing loops , the polymer can bend much more often and hence spiral animals would be more compact than the spiral trees .",

    "we made @xmath134 mc runs .",
    "the moment of inertia tensor @xmath26 as a function of @xmath20 is plotted in fig [ 2drad1 ] and fig [ 2drad2 ] . assuming the asymptotic form to be such that    @xmath135    using above written form , we get the estimate of @xmath10 to be ( fig [ 2drad1 ] and fig [ 2drad2 ] )    @xmath136    in incomplete enumeration mc algorithm @xcite , each configuration of @xmath20 sites is generated with equal probability @xmath137 which is just @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the probability with which an edge between level @xmath50 and @xmath140 on the genealogical tree of the problem is chosen . by keeping track of the average number of clusters of a given size generated in a given run , one can estimate the growth constant @xmath3 and the critical exponent @xmath9 .",
    "but , the variance of the number of clusters increases as @xmath141 , @xmath142 for large @xmath20 .",
    "hence , instead we counted the number of descendants of each spiral tree generated .",
    "this approach has been used previously in @xcite .",
    "the mean number of descendants of a tree of size @xmath20 gives a direct estimate of @xmath143 .",

    "in dimensions higher than two , the spiral constraint defined as the projection of path joining any site of the tree to the root in @xmath13 plane contains no left turn can be employed in two ways .",
    "@xcite defined it such that for the projected path from origin to site on @xmath13 plane only forward and right turns are allowed .",
    "but in dimensions higher than two , we can define another variation where trees as long as they do not violate the tree constraint and the projection on @xmath13 plane is spiral , are allowed .",
    "we will call the spiral trees with only forward and right turns allowed as @xmath152 .",
    "if we allow for back - turns also , we would get different series because for example , fig [ 3dst ] shows one spiral tree of six sites which would not be a valid configuration if we consider only forward and right turns .",
    "we call the spiral trees with back - turns allowed as @xmath153 .",
    "naively , one would expect these two to belong to the same universality class .",

    "the difference in value of @xmath3 for @xmath152 and @xmath153 is understandable as @xmath153 has a greater number of configurations .",
    "more surprisingly , the critical exponents @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 within our error estimates are different in two models . in neither case , the conjectured dimensional reduction(eq.1 and 2 ) seems to be satisfied .",

    "al . gave a plausible argument of curling up of the dimensions in the spiralling plane and had conjectured a dimensional reduction by four for spiral trees .",
    "our numerical evidence as presented in this paper does not support the conjecture .",

    "in contrast , our studies show different critical behaviour of spiral trees with different geometrical restrictions in three and four dimensions .",
    "we should note that for the large clusters of size @xmath131 generated by monte carlo , the total angle turned by the largest spiral arm about the origin is about @xmath130 .",
    "it is possible that the structure of spiral trees is such that this angle tends to infinity as @xmath20 tends to infinity . in this case",
    "the crossover value above which asymptotic behaviour sets in would be expected to be of order @xmath131 , and series analysis for smaller @xmath20 may not give correct limiting behaviour .",
    "one indication that trees where spiral turns a lot are important is that the growth constant for spiral trees in a quadrant @xmath59 seems to be significantly smaller than for full spiral trees .    for quadrant spiral trees on a square lattice",
