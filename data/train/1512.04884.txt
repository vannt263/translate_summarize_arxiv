    "spontaneous collective motion , a coordinated motion of an assembly of moving entities which interact locally without any leader , has recently drawn a lot of attention from the statistical physics community  @xcite . such a phenomenon is present both in biological systems like motility assays  @xcite and bacterial colonies  @xcite or on a larger scale insects swarms  @xcite and flocks of birds  @xcite , as well as in engineered systems like driven colloids  @xcite , droplets  @xcite , or grains  @xcite . from a theoretical perspective ,",
    "such moving individuals are represented as polar self - propelled particles , that is , particles set in motion by a driving force directed along the heading vector of the particle .",
    "this driving force being balanced by a friction force , a constant speed is reached in the absence of interaction with obstacles or other particles .",
    "assuming , as a simplification , that the speed is always constant leads to minimal models like the vicsek model  @xcite , where particles also interact with their neighbors so as to align their velocity vectors , up to some noise .",
    "in other words , vicsek - type models can be thought of as spin - models  @xcite , where particles move along the direction of their spin instead of remaining fixed on the node of a lattice .",
    "this analogy with spin models is important because in two dimensions ( the dimension in which the vicsek model is usually defined ) , the mermin - wagner theorem  @xcite prevents the existence of long - range order for equilibrium models of spins that are invariant under global rotation of the spins , due to the presence of low - energy excitations called spin - waves   @xcite .",
    "the existence of long - range order in the two - dimensional vicsek model @xcite thus reveals the intrinsic non - equilibrium character of the model , and to some extent , of the phenomenon of collective motion itself .",
    "the presence of long - range order in the vicsek model can be understood as resulting from the continuous evolution of the neighborhood of a given particle , which successively interact with different particles .    as mentioned above",
    ", an important simplification of vicsek - type models is to identify the direction of motion with that of the heading vector of the particles . at low enough density , when the relaxation time of the velocity is short as compared to the typical time between successive interactions , this approximation is well - justified . in a denser regime however , as observed in experiments on shaken polar grains  @xcite , velocity and heading vectors may have different directions , and it is a priori relevant to consider them as distinct dynamical variables , as done in  @xcite , assuming a suitable coupling between velocity and heading .",
    "in this situation , we are thus dealing with a fluid of particles carrying a ( classical ) spin .",
    "when considering both velocity and heading ( or spin ) variables , the possible existence of collective motion at equilibrium can not be immediately ruled out by standard arguments if spins and velocities are coupled .",
    "the first argument ( in two dimension ) is the mermin ",
    "wagner theorem , but its applicability is not granted if spins interact with velocities , because the system is then no longer invariant under a rotation of the spins alone .",
    "the second argument is that for an isolated system at equilibrium the momentum is conserved and no spontaneous global motion can emerge .",
    "alternatively , boundaries or a substrate may break momentum conservation , but they act as a momentum sink , also preventing collective motion .",
    "these arguments are however valid only if the standard relation @xmath0 between momentum and velocity holds .",
    "although very general , it is well - known that such a relation breaks down when the ` potential energy ' ( the potential term in the lagrangian ) depends on the velocities as is the case for charges in magnetic field .",
    "a third argument related to the second one , is that at equilibrium the center - of - mass velocity is conjugated , in a thermodynamic sense , to momentum  just like temperature is conjugated to energy  and is thus equal to that of the surrounding medium @xcite",
    ". invoking galilean invariance , one then usually sets the center - of - mass velocity to zero .",
    "however galilean invariance does not hold in those above situations where the potential term in the lagrangian depends on the velocities , so that the center - of - mass velocity should be a relevant parameter in this case .",
    "a natural question is thus to investigate whether a coupling between velocity and spin variables could break the galilean invariance , modify the standard definition of momentum , and as a result allow for the possibility of collective motion at equilibrium  equilibrium being understood in the generic sense of the statistical steady - state of a hamiltonian system , in the absence of external forcing .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate this issue by considering a simple two - dimensional model of point - like particles carrying a spin and evolving according to a conservative dynamics coupling spin and velocity in a minimal way .",
    "the dynamics is originally defined in a lagrangian formalism , from which a hamiltonian formulation is derived .",
    "a non - standard expression of the momentum of each particle in terms of its velocity and spin is obtained .",
    "we study the statistical mechanics of such a system , and show that in the fully connected ( or mean - field ) case a transition to collective motion occurs .",
    "the velocity of the center of mass , which in the absence of galilean invariance , is a relevant variable , also feeds back on the magnetization properties : it acts as an external magnetic field that smoothens the transition and stabilizes non trivial local minima of the free energy .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of finite size systems confirm the existence of a homogeneous polar phase . increasing sizes",
    ", the system organizes into domains of collectively moving particles structured around topological defects .",
    "we start by considering a liquid of xy - spins in two dimensions .",
    "the lagrangian of such a model is described by @xmath1 with :    [ eq : lagrangienxy ] @xmath2    where @xmath3 , with @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , denoting the position , the angle and the spin of each particle respectively ( the dot on top of a variable denotes time derivative ) .",
    "note that the spin @xmath6 is defined as @xmath7 .",
    "the other parameters appearing in the lagrangian are the mass @xmath8 of the particles , their moment of inertia @xmath9 associated to spin rotation , the coupling @xmath10 between spins , the external field @xmath11 , and the interaction potential @xmath12 between particles ( e.g. , hard sphere or lennard - jones potential ) . with the model as it stands , there is coordination of spins at low temperature .",
    "however there is no coupling between spin and particle motion , so that no collective motion can emerge . to couple the motion of the particles to the spin we add to the lagrangian a term @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a coupling constant between spin and velocity , which is expected to favor the alignment of the velocity of particle @xmath15 to its _ own _",
    "spin @xmath6 .",
    "apart from the fact that it should contribute to align velocities when spins align although we shall see that the effect is really indirect and counter - intuitive this term is motivated by the observation of such self - alignment in real systems of self - propelled grains  @xcite and has been identified as a key ingredient for the dynamics of self - propelled discs  @xcite .    leaving aside the potential term @xmath16 , although we shall reintroduce it when moving to the molecular dynamics simulations , our starting point is thus the following dimensionless lagrangian : @xmath17 where we used the following redefinitions    @xmath18    the parameter @xmath14 now controls the strength of the alignment between spin and velocity .",
    "the euler ",
    "lagrange equations then read    [ eq : lagrangegroupreq ] @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a unit vector perpendicular to the spin , defined as @xmath22 . finally , we reformulate the dynamics in the hamiltonian formalism .",
    "the momenta @xmath23 and @xmath24 conjugate to the positions @xmath4 and angles @xmath5 read :    [ eq : conjmoment ] @xmath25    the spin of the particle acts as an internal potential vector and only for @xmath26 is the momentum equal to the velocity",
    ". the hamiltonian is obtained by the usual legendre transform of the lagrangian @xmath27 expressing @xmath28 and @xmath29 in terms of the conjugate variables @xmath23 and @xmath24 , one finds , discarding an irrelevant constant term : @xmath30 the equations of motion follow :    [ eq : hamiltongroupreq ] @xmath31    let us note that , up to a constant the hamiltonian can be formally written as @xmath32 although this is not a proper formulation in terms of the canonical variables , it shows that written in terms of kinetic and potential energy , the hamiltonian takes a form similar to the one of a standard liquid of particles carrying an xy - spin .",
    "the subtlety hidden in this misleadingly simple formulation is that @xmath28 is not proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "taking advantage of the lagrangian formulation , we apply noether s theorem to obtain the conserved quantities of the dynamics , associated to the continuous transformation under which the lagrangian is invariant .",
    "first of all , the lagrangian is invariant under time and space translation , so that the dynamics conserves the energy @xmath33 and the _ generalized _ linear momentum @xmath34 obtained by summing over all particles : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the center of mass velocity and @xmath37 is the total magnetization of the system .",
    "this simple but essential formula relates the total momentum of the system to the collective motion , described by the velocity of the center of mass , and the total magnetization of the system .",
    "although the generalized linear momentum considered here is not proportional to the velocity of the center of mass , this conservation law is in stark contrast with most two - dimensional models for collective motion , for which momentum is not conserved .",
    "the equations of motion are not invariant under a rotation of the system ( i.e. , a global rotation of the position of particles ) , as can be seen from , where the scalar product is not invariant , as the spins do not rotate , and also because of the presence of the external field @xmath11 .",
    ", the invariance is however recovered under a transformation in which the spins are rotated together with the positions of the particles . in that case",
    "a supplementary conserved quantity is @xmath38 with @xmath39 the usual angular momentum . in practice , even when the field @xmath40 , this rotational invariance is broken because of boundary conditions .",
    "]    finally , let us stress a significant difference with the standard xy - model  @xcite .",
    "in the present case , there is no symmetry under rotation of the spins alone .",
    "accordingly spin waves are not slow modes of the dynamics and the mermin - wagner theorem ( at least in its form ) does not apply , opening the way for possible long - range order .",
    "interestingly the dynamics is not time reversible .",
    "applying the transformation @xmath41 :    @xmath42    to the euler - lagrange equations  , they transform into    @xmath43    which differ from the original ones [ eq .  ] , unless @xmath26 .",
    "note that although the hamiltonian is symmetric under time reversal , it does not imply time reversibility of the trajectories because @xmath23 transforms under time reversal into @xmath44 , as can also be checked directly from eq .  .",
    "the invariance of the trajectories can be recovered using the more general transformation @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in this case",
    ", one has @xmath47 and both the hamiltonian and the trajectories are invariant .",
    "the invariance under this more general transformation can be interpreted as a generalized form of microreversibility . at a heuristic level",
    ", this suggests that a generalized form of detailed balance , associated to a uniform measure in the micro - canonical ensemble , may hold .",
    "also central in classical mechanics is the galilean invariance , which states that the equations of motion are identical in different coordinate systems moving with constant velocity with respect to each other . applying a galilean transformation to the euler - lagrange equations   @xmath48",
    "while keeping @xmath5 and its derivatives unchanged , one finds in the new frame , dropping primes to lighten notations , @xmath49 where the extra term @xmath50 in the last equation breaks galilean invariance .",
    "this absence of galilean invariance is actually connected to the fact that the total momentum @xmath34 is not proportional to the velocity @xmath36 of the center of mass , as can be seen from the following argument .",
    "the term responsible for the broken galilean invariance is the term @xmath51 coupling spin and velocity [ eq .  ] .",
    "let us momentarily consider a general coupling term @xmath51 , assuming simply that it depends only on the spins @xmath52 and the velocities @xmath28 , @xmath53 .",
    "then the total momentum reads @xmath54 and is thus generically not proportional to the velocity of the center of mass .",
    "however , if the coupling term @xmath51 satisfies galilean invariance , one has @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the velocity shift associated to an infinitesimal galilean transformation , resulting in @xmath57 so that one recovers @xmath58 . in the following , when discussing the role of the broken galilean invariance , we may thus consider the following coupling term , @xmath59 for @xmath60 , this term corresponds to the coupling defined in eq .  ,",
    "while for @xmath61 , galilean invariance is recovered and @xmath58 .      to gain some intuition on particle motion , it is useful to analyze the equations of motion for a single and free particle @xmath62 .",
    "the individual momentum is conserved , @xmath63 .",
    "taking the temporal derivative of eq .   and using eq .",
    ", one gets @xmath64 where the coordinate system has been set such that @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "one recognizes the equation of motion of a pendulum : the spin @xmath67 oscillates around the direction @xmath68 with a frequency @xmath69 .",
    "the velocity of the particle follows from eq .  , as illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : dirspin ] in the case @xmath70 .",
    "( top ) and @xmath71 ( middle ) .",
    "the momentum @xmath72 is conserved , the spin @xmath6 oscillates around the direction given by @xmath23 with a frequency @xmath69 .",
    "the velocity @xmath28 is then entirely set by eq .  .",
    "the plots in the bottom row show that only the @xmath73-components of the trajectories differ , whereas the @xmath74-components oscillate on the same trajectory . ]    using the conservation of the angular momentum @xmath75 ( see footnote 1 ) , one finds @xmath76 .",
    "the motion of the particle , perpendicular to the direction of its momentum , follows the periodic motion of @xmath77 .",
    "the dynamics along the direction of the momentum is more complicated . from eq .",
    "one has @xmath78 . for small enough @xmath14 , @xmath79",
    ", the particle always moves in the direction of its momentum .",
    "however , for larger k , the motion strongly depends on the dynamics of @xmath80 ; and , for small @xmath80 , that is when the spin points to a direction close to that of the momentum , the particle moves into the opposite direction ! this counter - intuitive behavior is deeply rooted in the conservation of @xmath81 . in the following",
    "we shall see that the constraints imposed on the dynamics by the conservation laws , together with the coupling between the spins and the velocities , lead at the mean - field level to the onset of collective motion .",
    "starting from the hamiltonian formulation of the model a liouville equation can be written for the probability density function of the phase - space point @xmath82 .",
    "it follows that at equilibrium the probability distribution is a function of the conserved quantities of the dynamics , namely the energy @xmath83 and the linear momentum @xmath34 . in the microcanonical ensemble , the conserved quantities",
    "can not be exchanged with the environment ; they have constant values @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively , and the distribution @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the microcanonical partition function , defined by normalizing @xmath89 to @xmath90 .",
    "in other words , all configurations with the same values of the conserved quantities are equally probable .    in practice ,",
    "it is more convenient from a computational viewpoint to work in the canonical ensemble where the conserved quantities are exchanged with a reservoir . the probability measure in the canonical ensemble is then given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are intensive control parameters of the reservoir that determine the thermal averages of @xmath83 and @xmath34 ( @xmath92 denotes , as usual , the inverse temperature ) .      the distribution of the microscopic configurations can be written more explicitly as @xmath94 with @xmath95\\\\    \\psi(r_{ik } , \\theta_{ik } )     & = \\exp\\bigl(\\beta j(r_{ik } ) \\cos\\theta_{ik}\\bigr ) \\",
    ", , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and where @xmath96 is the partition function , with @xmath97 from the distribution , one can easily compute the first and second moments of the momenta @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "for the first moments , one finds @xmath98 and @xmath99 using eq .   in eq .",
    "yields @xmath100 .",
    "taking the sum over all particles and dividing by @xmath101 then leads to @xmath102 this relation , which shows that the intensive parameter @xmath93 associated to the conservation of momentum is the averaged velocity of the center of mass is not specific to the present model .",
    "it is a general property of equilibrium systems  @xcite .",
    "however , in the presence of galilean invariance one can arbitrarily set @xmath103 and safely ignore @xmath93 in the partition function . here because of the broken galilean invariance we shall on the contrary keep it as a true and independent intensive thermodynamic parameter . inserting eq .   into eq .",
    ", we end up with @xmath104 which can be seen as a ` local ' counterpart of eq .  .",
    "for the second moment , one finds a generalization of the equipartition relations , with @xmath105 , @xmath106 hence not only are the average values of momentum and spin related , as could have been anticipated from eq .  ,",
    "but so are also their fluctuations .",
    "note however that the temperature is _ not _ proportional to the total kinetic energy because of the coupling between the translational velocities and the spins .",
    "we now study the behavior of the mean magnetization as a function of temperature and center of mass velocity ( or equivalently , @xmath93 ) . to keep the discussion at a simple enough level , we focus on the fully connected geometry , which is akin to a mean - field approximation ( note that the momenta @xmath107 and spins @xmath52 however remain two - dimensional vectors ) . in this case , the interaction amplitude @xmath108 is simply a constant , independent of the distance between particles . to ensure that energy remains extensive , we take this constant to be equal to @xmath109 .",
    "the interaction term can then be rewritten as follows @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the magnetization per spin . disregarding the constant term ( which amounts to a shift in the energy reference ) , the integrations of eqs .  , and over @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 are readily computed , yielding @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the volume occupied by the system .",

    "and stirling s approximation , the free energy density @xmath130 then reads @xmath131 it is a function of intensive variables only .",

    "although observing an ordering transition in a mean - field framework usually does not come as a surprise , let us emphasize that the present transition is non - standard even at mean - field level , in the sense that collective motion can not be observed in equilibrium systems where momentum is either conserved or exchanged with a substrate , as long as the relation @xmath156 is valid .",

    "[ fig : constp ] the magnetization computed in the canonical ensemble as a function of ( @xmath83 , @xmath199 or more conveniently ( @xmath92,@xmath34 ) . for finite @xmath34 continuous branches of solution relate the disordered state at high temperature to the homogeneous magnetized state at low temperature .",
    "these branches resemble very much those obtained from the microcanonical simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_fc ] ) .",
    "the zero - momentum case is very peculiar : there is a finite range of energy , or @xmath194 , where no solutions with homogeneous magnetization exist . because of finite - size effects",
    ", this peculiarity could not be captured in the microcanonical simulations . also , from the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_fc ] it is not yet clear whether the magnetization at @xmath200 survives the limit of large systems , @xmath201 .",
    "the transition shifts more and more to the left , but more systematic investigation would be necessary to know whether it converges to a nonzero critical temperature . as a first step we looked at finite size effects , focusing on the ground state .",
    "we ran the annealing protocol on ten systems of size @xmath202 , for respectively @xmath180 and @xmath203 . by increasing the system size , the fully ordered state is now replaced by an inhomogeneous state with zero total magnetization , in a way similar to the effect of increasing @xmath14 at a given system size ( fig .  [ fig : gs]b  d ) .",
    "the crossover size is larger for smaller  @xmath14 . given that for @xmath26 no long - range order is expected , these observations suggest that long - range order may not survive in the thermodynamic limit for all  @xmath14 . obtaining the precise scaling in @xmath14 , temperature and system size would require a deeper analysis , both theoretically and numerically , which is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "in order to discuss the above observations , let us recall that the hamiltonian can be interpreted as the sum of the kinetic and potential energies , in which the peculiarity of the present model is entirely encoded in the unusual relation @xmath204 ( see eq .   in section  [ definition ] ) . to obtain low energy states ,",
    "the system should ( i ) minimize its kinetic energy , thus decrease all @xmath205 and generate small @xmath206 states ; ( ii ) align its spins , thus favoring states with large @xmath207 .",
    "however this is incompatible with the constraint @xmath208 . in particular , because the constraint imposes latexmath:[$n|{\\mathbf{v}}| = k    energy .",
    "this dynamical frustration is all the more important that @xmath14 is large .",
    "this is why decreasing @xmath14 is a way to favor ordered states at low energy . at larger @xmath14 ,",
    "the system selects zero magnetization states , at the price of generating bend and splay in the spin field .",
    "also the larger the system , the smaller are these distortions .",
    "this is why only small @xmath14 and small size system exhibit homogeneously ordered phases .    in summary ,",
    "we have proposed in this paper a conservative model of particles in which velocities and spins are coupled .",
    "starting from a lagrangian formulation and deriving from it the hamiltonian one , we obtained using the symmetries of the problem that the total ( generalized ) linear momentum is conserved but is no longer proportional to the center - of - mass velocity .",
    "we then studied the effect of this important change on spin statistics and on collective motion .",
    "our main findings are that ( i ) collective motion sets in starting from an immobile system , provided that the spins are able to align ferro - magnetically as observed in particular in the fully connected geometry , or in small enough systems , and ( ii ) the parameter @xmath210 thermodynamically conjugated to linear momentum acts as an external magnetic field on the magnetization .",
    "more generally , the main interest of the present model is to show that collective motion , albeit perhaps of a nonstandard type , is possible even for conservative models , provided that spins and velocities are coupled .",
    "although it is hard to imagine a physical realization of the present model , the latter however has the virtue of showing that , at least at a conceptual level , energy dissipation is not a necessary ingredient for collective motion . also , in a spirit similar to that of  @xcite it brings the transition to collective motion on a theoretical playground where a number of tools have been developed to characterize phase transitions .    the present paper aimed at introducing the model ,",
    "discuss its symmetries and the crucial role of the broken galilean invariance .",
    "as such , it remains very preliminary .",
    "we have only looked at the mean field scenario , and illustrated the model behavior on a few md simulations .",
    "a number of perspectives can be mentioned .",
    "obviously one would like to investigate more systematically the phase diagram of the system and the existence of a phase transition in the infinite size limit .",
    "also , it would be interesting to make progress in the direction of the theoretical analysis of the model in finite dimension .",
    "in particular two limits of interest are @xmath211 , which corresponds to the intricate physics of the xy - model and its berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition , and @xmath212 , where galilean invariance is recovered .",
    "perturbative approaches using @xmath14 and/or @xmath213 as small parameters could be a way to tackle this theoretical analysis . besides",
    ", we have not yet explored the possibility that the model might be invariant under a more complicated transformation than the galilean one , in analogy to the lorentz transform that arises in the context of electromagnetism .",
    "whether such a transformation exists is however far from clear ; in electromagnetic systems , the invariance under the lorentz transform is only obtained when considering relativistic mechanics , while our model remains within the realm of newtonian mechanics .",
    "interesting discussions with j .- l .",
    "barrat on the mermin - wagner theorem are acknowledged .",
    "in this appendix , we provide the detailed derivation of the mean - field free energy @xmath214 given in eq .  .",
    "starting from eq .  , we need to compute the following integral , @xmath215 to write the exponential function as a linear function of @xmath216 we use the hubbard ",
    "stratonovich transformation , @xmath217 considering for instance the @xmath73-component , and setting @xmath218 and @xmath219 , one gets @xmath220 combining the two directions @xmath73 and @xmath74 yields for the partition function , using the notation @xmath221 , @xmath222 where @xmath223 up to a shift on the variable @xmath5 ( that is irrelevant since integration is on the circle ) , the scalar product @xmath224 can be expressed as @xmath225 where @xmath226 .",
