    "the ` @xmath84-strangers ' , the ` secret sharing ' , the ` liar detection ' , and the ` byzantine agreement ' are examples of unsolvable problems using the classical computation . on the other hand , they can be solved using quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the supersinglet states are the key of this procedure .",
    "so motivated , we have presented here a feasible scheme for generation of the @xmath17 supersinglet state using three - level atoms .",
    "the present scheme sounds experimentally advantageous @xcite in comparison with that in ref .",
    "@xcite since it uses only a single cavity . in our numerical simulations we have used two values for the coupling constant , given by @xmath70mhz @xcite and @xmath74mhz @xcite , and rydberg atoms with quantum number @xmath85 and @xmath82 , respectively . we note that the fidelity of the wanted state increases for small values of the detuning . for example , for @xmath71s , @xmath72s , and @xmath73s ( @xmath70mhz and @xmath78 ) the fidelity and success probability",

    "it is worth stressing that a nonideal fidelity does not forbid the application of this supersinglet to solve some protocols .",
    "for example , in the liar detection @xcite a lot of supersinglet states are requested to provide a list of possible detections of the components . in this case",
    ", the occurrence of a few errors in the list due to imperfections in the state does not affect the main result .",
    "also , the atomic decay and the control of the velocity distributions can be neglected regarding the fidelity of the scheme , since the lifetime of rydberg atoms with @xmath82 is about 30ms , i.e. , @xmath90 times higher than the interaction times considered here and the velocity distribution of the atomic beam presents a small deviation , around 0.3@xmath91 @xcite . in conclusion ,",
    "taking into account the potential applications of this state and the feasibility of the scheme we believe that this supersinglet state can be experimentally implemented .",
    "we thank the capes , cnpq , and funape / go , brazilian agencies , for the partial supports .",
    "this work is also partially supported by natural science basic research plan in the shaanxi province of china ( program no : sj08a13 ) , the natural science foundation of the education bureau of shaanxi province , china under grant o9jk534 .",
    "the detection of the cavity - field mode is discussed below . to this end",
    ", we consider an auxiliary atom in its ground state ( @xmath92 ) to interact with the cavity field , obeying the following possibilities :    @xmath93    to ensure that the cavity is in its vacuum state , we set the interaction time ( @xmath94 ) appropriately to maximize the probability of photon absorption .",
    "as an example , considering the case with @xmath78 , @xmath70mhz , and adjusting @xmath95s , we obtain a maximum error of @xmath96 , @xmath97 , or @xmath98 for the detection of the ground state in the cases with one- , two- , or three - photons , respectively ( in eqs .",
    "( [ ap1]b-[ap1]d ) ) .",
    "so , the selective atomic detection in the ground state guarantees the generation of the supersinglet state ( [ s33 ] ) with a success probability greater than @xmath99 using a single auxiliary atom .",
    "note that by the support of more atoms ( previously prepared in the ground state @xmath11 , where the interaction time is tuned with the same value of @xmath94 ) this error can be reduced even more , e.g. , in the case of another auxiliary atom the maximum error in the absorption is about @xmath100 ( success probability @xmath101 ) ."
