    "the on - going work by the united nations , following the major report of the @xcite in 2007 and the climate change conferences in copenhagen and cancun ( mexico ) , centres on the prediction of future climate change , a key feature of which would be any suggestion of a sudden and ( possibly ) irreversible abrupt change called a tipping point ( @xcite )",
    ". many tipping points , such as the switching on and off of ice - ages , are well documented in paleo - climate studies over millions of years of the earth s history .",
    "predicting such tippings in advance using time - series data derived from preceding behaviour is now seen as a major challenge , impinging , for example on the possible use of geo - engineering ( @xcite ) .",
    "techniques introduced by @xcite and @xcite draw on the assumption that the tipping events are governed by a bifurcation in an underlying nonlinear dissipative dynamical system . specifically , researchers search for a slowing down of intrinsic transient responses within the data , which is predicted to occur before most bifurcational instabilities .",
    "this is done by determining a so - called propagator , estimated from the correlation between successive elements of a window sliding along the time series ( this estimate is called @xmath0 in this paper ) .",
    "this propagator , such as the ar(1 ) mapping coefficient , is a measure of the linear decay rate and should increase to unity at a tipping instability ( corresponding to a decrease of the linear decay rate to zero ) .",
    "prediction techniques can be tested on climatic computer models , but more challenging is to try to predict real ancient climate tippings , using their preceding geological data provided by ice cores , sediments , etc . using this preceding data alone",
    ", the aim would be to see to what extent the actual tipping could have been predicted in advance .",
    "one such study by @xcite looks at the end of the most recent ice age and the associated younger dryas event , about @xmath1 years ago , when the arctic warmed by @xmath2 in @xmath3 years .",
    "this pioneering study used a time series derived from greenland ice - core paleo - temperature data . a second such study ( one of eight made by @xcite )",
    ", using data from tropical pacific sediments , gives a good prediction for the end of ` greenhouse ' earth about @xmath4 million years ago when the climate tipped from a tropical state into an icehouse state .",
    "[ lenton _ et al .",
    "_ this volume ]  gives a complete overview of current techniques for extracting early - warning signals from time series and compares them on realistic models and a range of paleo - climate time series .",
    "a remark that is made during the analysis of [ lenton _ et al .",
    "_ this volume ]  is that the absolute values of the extracted quantities have no direct bearing on the tipping probability over time unless one knows also the size of the _ basin of attraction_. this basin is determined in the simplest cases by the dominant nonlinear term in the underlying equations of motion , which is the subject of this paper .",
    "the core techniques for analysis of time series of climate data aim to extract the linear decay rate toward ( a possibly drifting ) noise - perturbed equilibrium @xcite .",
    "these techniques can be directed at the earth s climate as a whole , or at the relevant climate sub - systems described by @xcite as _ tipping elements_. our aim here is to augment this linear information with information about nonlinear features of the underlying dynamics , by examining to what extent we can identify nonlinear softening and include it into the list of early - warning signs for climate tipping .",
    "as we approach a dangerous bifurcation , from which a nonlinear dissipative dynamical system will experience a finite jump to a remote alternative state , the current attractor is located within a shrinking basin of attraction .",
    "correspondingly , the maintenance of the state will become increasingly precarious in the presence of noisy disturbances .",
    "thinking in terms of an underlying potential energy function ( the existence of which is theoretically well - defined for a saddle - node fold and some other bifurcations ) the parabolic shape of its graph will become increasingly perturbed by softening nonlinear features .",
    "the relevant bifurcations are the so - called _ codimension - one _ events ( @xcite ) , namely those that can be typically encountered under a gradual change of a single control parameter .",
    "the complete list of the dangerous codimension - one bifurcations is given in table  [ tab : bifs ] , where we give a brief description of the nature of the shrinking basin .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .    *",

    "figure  [ fig : c360](a ) , we illustrate both types of the saddle - node fold bifurcation : the static fold involving a path of equilibrium fixed - points , and the cyclic fold involving a trace of periodic orbits . for these",
    "the basin shrinkage is one - sided .",
    "the basin is bounded by the unstable side of the parabolically folding path .",
    "next , in figure  [ fig : c360](b ) , we illustrate the local subcritical bifurcations of which the hopf , flip and neimark are codimension - one ( we remember that the more familiar static pitchfork bifurcations are codimension - two , being structurally unstable against a symmetry - breaking perturbation ) . here we see an unstable solution , which controls the basin boundary , shrinking parabolically around the stable solution , from which the ( noise - free ) system jumps out of our field of view as the control parameter , @xmath5 , reaches its critical value of @xmath6 .",
    "the static fold and the hopf bifurcation have a theoretically well - defined potential energy surface that neatly summarizes the shrinking basin as illustrated in figure  [ fig : c361 ] .",
    "note that figure  [ fig : c361](a ) will be discussed more fully in section  [ sec : concepts]([sec : fold ] ) .",
    "the fold is the simplest and most common way in which an equilibrium of a nonlinear dissipative dynamical system can lose its stability . having only a single active degree of freedom ( @xmath7 ) and being observable under the variation of a single control parameter ( @xmath5 ) it can be illustrated on a graph of @xmath7 against @xmath5 as a smooth curve that simply reaches an extreme value ( a maximum , say ) of the control @xmath5 , as shown in figure  [ fig : c360](a ) .",
    "so although it is traditionally called a saddle - node bifurcation , it does not exhibit any obvious ` bifurcation ' of a path , but rather just a smooth folding of an existing path . in the case of a static fold ( to which we shall largely restrict our attention )",
    "the path is a trace of equilibrium fixed points , while for a cyclic fold the path would be a trace of periodic solutions .    assuming that we are close to a fold",
    ", the intrinsic damping of the system will have become super - critical so the system will have the non - oscillatory response of an over - damped particle sliding ( in thick oil , as we might imagine ) on a notional potential energy surface @xmath8 .",
    "this is illustrated for the fold in figure  [ fig : c361](a ) , where we show the potential energy surface erected over the @xmath9 base plane . here",
    "the solid part of the equilibrium path , corresponding to energy minima , is a stable node , while the dashed part , corresponding to energy maxima ( more generally a geometrical saddle in higher dimensions ) is an dynamically unstable saddle .",
    "we see that as the control @xmath5 is slowly increased towards its critical value , @xmath6 , the stable equilibrium solution gets closer and closer to the hill - top potential barrier , and so gets progressively more precarious in the presence of noisy disturbances . with @xmath5 increasing at an infinitesimal rate , noise",
    "will ensure escape over the hill - top before @xmath5 reaches @xmath6 .",
    "if , however , @xmath5 increases rapidly , this early escape may be delayed or supressed as we have examined quantitatively elsewhere ( @xcite ) .        to give a greater perspective to our view of the fold it is useful to introduce another control parameter @xmath10 such that our parameter space is now represented jointly by the @xmath11-plane .",
    "we can now erect an equilibrium surface , of height @xmath7 , over the two - dimensional control plane as illustrated in figure  [ fig : c357 ] . here",
    "we see two fold lines whose projections divide the control plane into regimes exhibiting either one or three co - existing solutions .",
    "these fold lines coalesce and vanish at the cusp .",
    "this cusp is a codimension - two phenomenon , which is typically only observed when we have independent control of both parameters ( @xmath12 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "this is made transparent by the fact that a typical path in control space can not be expected to pass precisely under the cusp point ; by contrast , if a parameter path passes through a fold line all near - by paths also cross this fold line , which is what ` the fold has codimension - one ' means . for an appropriate choice of path in the ( @xmath13-plane through the cusp one sees a pitchfork bifurcation ( @xcite ) .",
    "we will consider the case in which the main equilibrium sheet ( in grey ) is stable while the narrow inverted sheet ( white ) is unstable .",
    "a climate system will have a large number of possible control parameters , but in trying to predict a tipping point we will be studying a particular evolution which corresponds to a particular route in control space ; this is precisely why we are only likely to encounter a fold , and not a cusp in figure  [ fig : c357 ] . to explore possible scenarios that might underlie a tipping study , it is now useful to examine some possible routes in our two - parameter model of figure  [ fig : c357 ] .    consider , first , the simple scenario in which the system parameters take path @xmath14 leading transversally through a fold line .",
    "this is the classical encounter with a fold that is implicitly envisaged in earlier work . in the presence of noise",
    "a premature tip from n occurs with a certain probability depending on the noise level and the speed with which the path is traversed , as analysed by @xcite .",
    "if the noise level were particularly high , a jump from n could easily be perceived as a purely noise - induced jump with no bifurcation , even though it is actually caused by the proximity to the fold : this could hold even if there were no movement in the control space at all , the system having rested at n throughout ( [ ashwin _ et al .",
    "_ this volume ]  call this n - tipping ) .",
    "another scenario , not specifically illustrated in the figure , could arise if the route in control space approached the fold line , but then turned back away from it .",
    "analysis would then show a temporary decrease of the strength of the attraction ( with the ar(1 ) coefficient moving towards unity ) which might be discounted as a false alarm , even though the system did approach a fold and a noise - induced escape was temporarily probable . finally , in the scenario of path @xmath15 , one would observe a temporary increase of the ar(1 ) coefficient , even though no bifurcation is apparent but rather a gradual shift of the steady state .",
    "this shows that a rapid transition can be related to a nearby fold that was just barely missed .",
    "similarly , the scenario called r - tipping by [ ashwin _ et al .",
    "_ this volume ]  occurs if one changes the other control parameter in figure  [ fig : c357 ] sufficiently rapidly from the path @xmath15 to n ( avoiding the folds ) . in this scenario",
    "the system jumps to the other stable equilibrium despite having never crossed a bifurcation curve .",
    "the extraction of the underlying dynamics from time series is divided into subtasks of increasing difficulty .",
    "assume that we have a time series coming from a process that is either stationary or has a slowly drifting underlying parameter @xmath5 as suggested by the paths in figure  [ fig : c357 ] . in order to predict ( or identify ) the dynamics one attempts to extract the leading orders of the dominant components of the underlying equations of motion .",

    "in section  [ sec : quant ] we will use the saddle - node normal form to test the ability of a range of estimators to distinguish a time series generated by a process with a quadratic nonlinearity from a linear time series .",
    "two example time series and their analysis are shown in figure  [ fig : snfdata ] .",
    "both time series have identical linear properties but differ in the dominant nonlinear term of the deterministic part of the dynamics.the softening of the full ( estimated ) nonlinear potential well ( corresponding to the illustration in figure  [ fig : c361](a ) ) is displayed in figure  [ fig : c365 ] .",
    "the location of the slowly drifting equilibrium and its trend is estimated first .",
    "[ lenton _ et al .",
    "_ this volume ]  call this step detrending and propose either piecewise linear fitting or filtering with a gaussian kernel .",
    "the result of filtering with a gaussian kernel is shown as a thick grey curve in the row 1 of figure  [ fig : snfdata ] .",
    "every method for detrending requires a bandwidth parameter ( for example the width of the gaussian kernel ) . for figure",
    "[ fig : snfdata ] we chose the bandwidth which the kernel density estimation routine ( matlab s ` kde ` by @xcite ) offered .",
    "the thin black curve in figure  [ fig : snfdata](b-1 ) shows the true value of the quasi - equilibrium ( for @xmath35 ) .",
    "it gives a visual estimate of how the reliability of the zero - order estimates depends on the quality of the data .",
    "the oscillatory deviations of the extracted equilibrium ( thick light grey curve ) from its true value ( thin black curve ) shows that the automatically chosen bandwidth was slightly smaller than the theoretical optimum .      assuming that the deterministic part of the underlying process has a stable equilibrium @xmath36 ( which is possibly slowly drifting ) , and that the zero - order estimate is an approximation for @xmath36 , the next step is to estimate the linear decay rate @xmath37 toward @xmath36 and the trend of @xmath37 over time .",
    "generally , if the underlying deterministic process is high - dimensional then these estimates capture the dominant ( that is , smallest ) decay rate .",

    "fitting @xmath47 with a parabola ( where @xmath70 is irrelevant and @xmath71 ) is equivalent to using the variance @xmath72 of @xmath73 if the density @xmath74 is gaussian .",

    "methods based on properties of the spectrum of the time series were proposed and investigated by @xcite but are not discussed here .",
    "figure  [ fig : snfdata ] shows in row  3 how the estimates of @xmath65 from the quasi - stationary density compare to the acf estimates @xmath0 .",
    "for both time series the estimates are quantitatively close to the theoretical value of @xmath37 ( which is indicated by the thin black line in figure  [ fig : snfdata](a-3,b-3 ) ) .",
    "we also observe that in figure  [ fig : snfdata](a-3,b-3 ) the local trends of @xmath0 from the autocorrelation estimate and of @xmath65 based on the quasi - stationary density are strongly correlated , so it is unclear if monitoring both quantities really prevents false alarms .",
    "there is one notable difference between the ar(1 ) and the dfa estimate on one hand and the distribution - based estimate @xmath65 on the other hand : the estimate for @xmath65 based on the quasi - stationary density only looks at the distribution of the values @xmath75 in the window of interest but does not care about the order in which they appear .",
    "this is in contrast to , for example , the ar(1 ) estimate which determines the correlation between each value @xmath75 and its predecessor .      if the ar analysis shows the presence of a single positive dominant coefficient ( which gives evidence that the underlying dynamics has really one distinct direction in which the decay is slowest ) then one can combine both estimates of the decay rate to obtain an estimate of the amplitude @xmath26 of the additive noise .",
    "equations and imply that @xmath65 is an estimate for @xmath76 where @xmath37 and @xmath77 are the true linear decay rate and input noise amplitude . thus , if we replace the unknown @xmath37 by the estimate @xmath0 we can use the relation between @xmath65 and the true @xmath37 to estimate @xmath77 : @xmath78 where @xmath0 is the estimate of the linear decay rate obtained from the autocorrelation and @xmath65is the estimate obtained from the quasi - stationary density @xmath74 .",
    "this is an alternative to using the residual of the least - squares fit that one obtains when estimating @xmath0 .",
    "we found that the residual systematically underestimates the noise level in the normal form examples shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : snfdata ] .",
    "one problem left open by the linear analysis is that the quantitative value of the estimated linear decay rate @xmath37 and the estimated noise - level do not give any indication for the probability of tipping .",
    "what the linear methods estimate is the @xmath40 and the @xmath26 of a discrete process @xmath79 ( where the @xmath80 are assumed to be independent and normally distributed random numbers ) .",
    "the discrete process is the linearisation of the time-@xmath81 map of the continuous process .",
    "an estimate for @xmath40 less than but close to unity does not necessarily indicate that we are close to a stability boundary for the nonlinear problem .",
    "rather , it implies that the time step @xmath81 between successive measurements has been small compared to the mean decay time to half , @xmath82 , of the process : @xmath83 the _ trend _ of the estimated @xmath40 is an indicator for incipient tipping because ( if extrapolated in any way ) it gives an estimate for the time to tipping if one ignores the possibility of early escape .",
    "however , the trend of @xmath40 is less certain even in the artificial time series of figure  [ fig : snfdata ] .",
    "similarly , the estimated noise amplitude @xmath26 has to be compared to the coefficient in front of the leading nonlinear term of the right - hand side ( which equals @xmath84 in ) .",
    "the ratio between @xmath26 and nonlinear term enters the estimates for the probability of tipping if there is no discernible upward trend in @xmath40 ( n - tipping ) , or for the probability of early escape if the trend of @xmath40 points upwards ( see @xcite ) .",
    "so without at least an order - of - magnitude estimate of the leading nonlinear term the linear methods only provide an estimate for the tipping time if there is a clearly discernible trend in @xmath40 , and even then this estimate discounts early escape .",
    "figure  [ fig : snfdata ] illustrates this problem .",
    "apart from a slow trend both time series in figure  [ fig : snfdata ] have identical properties at the linear level .",
    "however , while for the time series in figure  [ fig : snfdata](b-1 ) the median time to tipping is @xmath85 according to @xcite ( indeed , it escapes shortly after @xmath86 ) , for the time series in figure  [ fig : snfdata](a-1 ) the extrapolation ( correctly ) predicts tipping ( or rather , linear instability ) at @xmath87 .",
    "thus , we observe that the linear properties of the time series alone are not sufficient to provide estimates about tipping , for example , the median time to tipping .",
    "the difference between the time series in figure  [ fig : snfdata](a-1 ) and figure  [ fig : snfdata](b-1 ) is in the dominant nonlinear term of the deterministic part . that this term plays",
