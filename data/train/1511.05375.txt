    "dna microarray and sequencing technologies allow investigators to measure the transcription levels of a large numbers of genes within several diverse experimental conditions ( or experimental samples ) [ @xcite ] .",
    "the experimental conditions may correspond to either different time points , different environmental samples , or different individuals or tissues .",
    "the data resulting from these technologies are usually referred to as _ gene expression data_.    a gene expression data set may be seen as a data matrix , with rows and columns respectively corresponding to genes and experimental conditions .",
    "each cell of this matrix represents the expression level of a gene under a biological condition .",
    "the analysis of gene expression data usually implies the search for groups of co - regulated genes , that is , groups of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns .",
    "inversely , the analysis may seek samples or conditions ( e.g. , patients ) with similar expression profiles .",
    "these may indicate the same attribute , such as a common type or state of a particular disease .",
    "vast amounts of gene expression data from numerous experiments are available for detailed analysis through public repositories such as the gene expression omnibus ( geo ) [ @xcite ] at the national center for biotechnology information .    in general , unveiling the hidden structure in gene expression data requires the use of exploratory analytical methods such as _ clustering_. cluster analysis has been used successfully to analyze a wide variety of transcriptomes [ e.g. , see the review by @xcite ] . as all major biological functions are built on the synergistic interplay of multiple proteins (",
    "the role of genes is to produce proteins ) , clustering similar gene expression patterns into distinct groups corresponds with the belief that different genes that are regulated and co - expressed at the same time and in similar locations are likely to contribute to the same biological functions .",
    "classical clustering analysis ( e.g. , the popular @xmath0-means algorithm [ @xcite ] ) associates a given gene with only one cluster .",
    "moreover , all genes in a given cluster must show similar co - regulation patterns across all experimental conditions .",
    "these are very stringent conditions for gene expression , as a given protein ( the product of a gene ) may have the capacity to regulate several different biochemical reactions .",
    "in fact , many proteins intervene in a number of different biological processes or biochemical functions , as documented in the gene ontology ( go ) project [ @xcite ] , a major bioinformatic initiative to unify the representation of gene and gene product attributes across all species .",
    "the go project provides an ontology of controlled vocabularies that describes gene products in terms of their associated biological processes , cellular components and molecular functions in a species - independent manner .",
    "classical clustering of genes ( or conditions ) can not assign a gene ( or a condition ) to several different clusters .",
    "the approach of biclustering better accommodates the multi - functional character of genes across subsets of experimental conditions .",
    "biclustering is the simultaneous clustering of genes ( rows ) and conditions ( columns ) . in biclustering",
    ", a given gene may be associated simultaneously with several different clusters , which may describe distinct biological processes that are run by a cell at a given time and which use a given set of proteins .",
    "@xcite seems to be the first to have applied a clustering method to simultaneously cluster rows and columns .",
    "he introduced the so - called _ direct clustering _",
    "algorithm , a partition - based algorithm that allows for the division of data into submatrices ( biclusters ) .",
    "we apply our methods to the analysis of gene expression data associated with retinal detachment ( rd ) , a disorder of the eye that typically leads to permanent vision loss .",
    "rd occurs when the sensory layer of the retina ( a thin tissue lining the back of the eye ) pulls away from the pigmented layer of the retina .",
    "this results from atrophy or tearing of the retina secondary to a systemic disease such as diabetes or from injury or other disturbances of the eye that allow fluids to enter the space between the sensory and pigmented retinal layers [ @xcite ] . surgical intervention to remove the detached parts of the retina",
    "is the current standard of care to prevent further progression of the disorder .",
    "if not treated properly , the entire retina will progressively detach , leading to complete blindness .",
    "better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in the progression of rd is of great interest in order to develop novel drugs to stop or slow the detachment process , either as a substitute for surgical intervention or to use in combination with surgical intervention .",
    "molecular events that occur during the progression of rd were studied via transcription profiling [ @xcite ] .",
    "briefly , 19 retinal biopsies from patients with rd were compared to 19 normal retinal samples using affymetrix microarrays .",
    "these arrays covered the human genome , with 54,000 probe - sets .",
    "the microarray data are publicly available at the national center for biotechnology information geo website [ @xcite ] as gse28133 .",
    "transcriptional changes in photoreceptor cells in the retina are the primary target for drug development . in an initial analysis of the retinal transcriptome",
    ", @xcite used @xmath1-tests ( as is normally done by bioinformatic labs ) to compare normal versus rd samples . in that analysis ,",
    "the rd inflammatory response dominated any other transcriptional changes [ @xcite ] .",
    "inflammation typically represents a secondary event that follows the initial stimulus that caused the first tissue detachment .",
    "unfortunately , the more subtle transcriptional changes in the photoreceptor cells related to the rd disorder were not well detected .    in the study by @xcite",
    ", mutual information techniques indicated that changes existed in the rd transcription profile other than those associated with inflammation , and that they may be a starting point for studying transcriptomic changes associated with the photoreceptor cells in rd .",
    "however , the mutual information procedure applied in that study involves iterative optimization of the results and appears to be rather difficult to automate . in this work ,",
    "we analyze the rd data with biclustering techniques .",
    "we choose biclustering techniques because traditional clustering approaches are not well suited for the analysis of proteins .",
    "some proteins assume multiple functions and/or work as hubs that mediate , link or simultaneously synchronize multiple biological processes ( such as the protein tp53 or stat1 [ @xcite ] ) . such characteristics of proteins make it very challenging to use traditional approaches for clustering the protein interaction networks .",
    "biclustering is well adapted to this aim . in rd ,",
    "anti - inflammatory reactions try to stop or slow the further advancement of the detachment , while apoptotic ( i.e. , cell death ) mechanisms degrade the parts of the retina that have been detached too long and where the fragile photoreceptor cells have already started to die . as the retina",
    "is composed of three layers with more than eight different cell types [ @xcite ] , studying the behavior of photoreceptor cells is complex , and biclustering represents a major advantage when needing to account for the multiple overlapping functional responses that occur during rd .",
    "good surveys of existing biclustering algorithms are available [ @xcite ] .",
    "cheng and church s algorithm [ @xcite ] and the plaid model [ @xcite ] are two of the most popular biclustering methods .",
    "it appears that @xcite were the first authors to propose the term biclustering for the analysis of microarray data .",
    "their algorithm consists of a greedy iterative search that aims to minimize the mean squared residual error . @xcite",
    "proposed the popular plaid model .",
    "they assumed that the expectation of each cell in the data matrix is formed with the contribution ( sum ) of different biclusters .",
    "others have generalized the plaid model into a bayesian framework [ @xcite ] .    from our review of the literature ,",
    "it is apparent that most models used for biclustering do not take into account application - specific prior information about genes or conditions and pairwise interactions between genes or conditions . in this work",
    ", we propose a model that accounts for this information .",
    "we adopt a gaussian plaid model as the model that describes the biclustering structure of the data matrix .",
    "in addition , we incorporate prior information on the dependency between genes and between conditions through dedicated relational graphs , one for the genes and another for the conditions .",
    "these graphs are conveniently described by auto - logistic models [ @xcite ( @xcite ) , @xcite ] for genes and conditions .",
    "the distributions are pairwise - interaction gibbs random fields for dependent binary data .",
    "they can be interpreted as generalizations of the finite - lattice ising model [ @xcite ] , which is a popular two - state discrete mathematical model for assessing ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics .",
    "we will refer to our overall model as the _ gibbs - plaid _ biclustering model .",
    "our prior is elicited from similarities obtained from the go annotations . an @xmath2-nearest - neighbor graph over the genes",
    "is built from these similarities .",
    "a key parameter of the auto - logistic prior is the so - called temperature parameter @xmath3 ( due to its analogy with the physical process of tempering ) .",
    "the normalizing constant of this prior is , in general , unknown and intractable .",
    "however , for computational purposes , this constant is needed to implement a stochastic algorithm that aims to estimate the posterior distribution of the genes bicluster memberships when @xmath3 is unknown .",
    "this means that the usual mcmc metropolis ",
    "hastings procedure is not applicable to our model .",
    "instead , we adopt a hybrid procedure that mixes the metropolis ",
    "hastings sampler with a variant of the wang ",
    "landau algorithm [ @xcite ] .",
    "the convergence of the proposed algorithm to the posterior distribution of the bicluster membership is guaranteed by the work of @xcite .",
    "we note that some earlier attempts to incorporate gene dependency information are available in the literature , but they were carried out within the context of clustering ( as opposed to biclustering ) and variable selection . @xcite",
    "provide a nice review .",
    "@xcite proposed a bayesian model that incorporates information on pathways and gene networks in the analysis of dna microarray data .",
    "they assumed a markov random field prior to capture the gene ",
    "gene interaction network .",
    "the neighborhood between the genes uses the pathway structure from the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ( kegg ) database [ @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have also used biological information to perform a clustering analysis of gene expression data .",
    "@xcite incorporated go annotations to predict survival time and time to metastasis for breast cancer patients using gene expression data as predictor variables .",
    "the potts model has also been used for clustering analysis of gene expression data [ @xcite ] . however , in these approaches , the potts model [ @xcite ] was used directly as a nonparametric model for clustering [ @xcite ] , and not as a prior that accounts for the gene  gene interaction on another clustering model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] introduces the proposed gibbs - plaid model for biclustering .",
    "section  [ sec : posterior ] describes the stochastic algorithm used to estimate the posterior distribution of the model parameters .",
    "this includes the combination of the wang  landau algorithm with the metropolis ",
    "hastings sampler .",

    "the supplementary material [ @xcite ] provides more complete results of our application to the rd data and a high - resolution image of figure  [ fig : bicluster4:network ] .",
    "let @xmath4 be the number of genes , and @xmath5 be the number of experimental conditions .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the logarithm of the expression level of gene @xmath7 under condition @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) .",
    "even though we actually work with the logarithm of the expression level , we refer to @xmath6 as the expression level .",
    "let @xmath0 be the number of biclusters . for all @xmath7 in the set of genes , @xmath8 in the set of conditions , and @xmath11",
    ", we define the binary variables @xmath12 and @xmath13 as taking values in @xmath14 , so that @xmath15 if and only if gene @xmath7 belongs to bicluster @xmath16 , and @xmath17 if and only if condition @xmath8 belongs to bicluster @xmath16 . the symbols @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the @xmath0-dimensional vector of components @xmath20 and the @xmath21-dimensional vector comprising all the vectors @xmath18 , @xmath22 , respectively . the symbols @xmath23 and @xmath24 are similarly defined for the conditions .",
    "let @xmath25 denote the set of parameters of the model , which are made explicit hereafter . in the plaid model , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a zero - mean error term and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 denotes the overall data mean , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the gene and condition effects associated with bicluster @xmath16 , measured as deviations from the bicluster mean @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "hereafter , we denote by @xmath34 the vector of means @xmath35 .",
    "the model parameters are given by @xmath36 .",
    "the most common distribution for the error term is a normal@xmath37 distribution [ @xcite ] .",
    "this is the model we adopt here . in the context of gene expression data ,",
    "the plaid model is a model for the logarithm of the gene expression levels . in the presence of extreme observations",
    ", a more robust model may be more appropriate , such as one with student-@xmath1 distributed errors . although some researchers have modeled the log - expression with more complex distributions such as gamma or double exponential distributions [ @xcite ] , the associated achievement of any gains within the context of biclustering is arguable .",
    "in fact , the simulation study in @xcite showed that the gaussian error term in the plaid model is fairly robust to heavily tailed errors .",
    "we assume that the variables @xmath6 s given the labels @xmath38 and @xmath39 are independent , that is , @xmath40 where @xmath41 stands for the standard normal density .",
    "given the bicluster labels @xmath42 , we define @xmath43 as the set of rows in the @xmath16th bicluster , and @xmath44 as the set of columns in the @xmath16th bicluster , @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath16th bicluster is given by @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath47 be the number of elements in the @xmath16th bicluster .",
    "the number of rows and columns in this bicluster will be denoted by @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath51 denote the vector of all @xmath52 s in @xmath53 , and @xmath54 stand for the identity matrix of dimension @xmath55 .",
    "we further assume that , given the bicluster labels , the prior of the gene effects @xmath56 is a multivariate normal distribution with mean zero and variance  covariance matrix given by @xmath57 . as shown in @xcite , we may change the parametrization of the model to a proper multivariate normal vector @xmath58 so that @xmath59.[def : a_k ] similarly , we suppose that the prior for @xmath60 follows a multivariate normal distribution with mean zero and variance  covariance matrix given by @xmath61 .",
    "note that these prior distributions satisfy the conditions of identifiability in the model , that is , they ensure that the gene and condition effects add up to zero for each bicluster .",
    "we set zero - mean independent normal priors with variances @xmath62 , and @xmath63 for the means @xmath29 and @xmath34 , respectively ; and set a scaled inverse chi - squared prior with scale @xmath64 and degrees - of - freedom @xmath65 for the variance @xmath66 .",
    "these hyperparameters are to be chosen adequately .",
    "for example , in our analysis in section  [ sec : experiments ] , we set @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "the gene labels @xmath12 as well as the condition labels @xmath69 are usually assumed to be independent [ @xcite ] . more realistically , in this work , we incorporate prior knowledge on the relation between genes and between conditions ( if applicable ) by means of relational graphs .",
    "for example , the gene relational graph is an @xmath2-nearest - neighbor graph for which the nodes correspond to the set of genes and the edges correspond to the set of `` most similar '' or  closer  genes .",
    "it is this notion of similarity that contains the relational information between genes .",
    "we define these similarities based on the go annotations , which define the association between gene products and terms .",
    "go terms are organized in a directed acyclic graph ( dag ) in which the parent - child relationships are edges . in this graph ,",
    "a go term can have multiple parents .",
    "all the go annotations associated with a term inherit all the properties of the ancestors of those terms .",
    "thus , child annotations inherit annotations from multiple parent terms .",
    "we adopt lin s pairwise similarity [ @xcite ] , which is based on the minimum subsumer of @xcite , as a means to build a notion of semantic similarity between any two go annotations .",
    "this idea was first introduced by @xcite .",
    "further details can be found in the supplementary material accompanying this paper [ @xcite ] .",
    "let @xmath70 denote the distance between genes @xmath7 and @xmath71 induced by lin s similarity between the genes @xmath72 .",
    "the gene relational graph is defined as having edge weights equal to @xmath73 here , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the temperature and kernel bandwidth parameters of the graph , respectively .",
    "we assume that @xmath76 for pairs of genes not connected by an edge in the @xmath2-nearest - neighbor data graph .",
    "the larger the weights , the more similar the genes .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath77 for nodes that are connected by an edge in the data graph .",
    "for example , for the rd data , we fix @xmath78 to define the @xmath2-nearest - neighbor graph for genes , as this is often recommended for high - dimensional data [ @xcite ] . with a set of 4645 probe - sets of the rd data ,",
    "we obtain a sparse graph , with a total of 135,498 edges , which is a total of 0.63% connectivity in the graph .",
    "this corresponds to an average graph degree ( number of edges spawned from each node ) of 29 .",
    "the distribution of the gene labels in this graph is given by the binary gibbs random field @xmath79 \\\\[-8pt ] & \\doteq & \\exp \\biggl\\{\\sum^{p}_{i=1}a_{i } \\rho_{ik } + \\sum_{i \\sim i'}b_{ii ' } \\bigl(t^{\\rho},\\sigma_{\\rho}\\bigr ) \\mathbf{1}_{\\ { \\rho_{ik}=\\rho_{i'k}\\ } } \\biggr\\ } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 are hyperparameters that control the amount of membership ( @xmath15 ) in the bicluster , and , for every relation @xmath81 , @xmath82 denotes the indicator function that takes the value @xmath52 if and only if the relation @xmath81 is satisfied .",
    "this gibbs field is actually a binary auto - logistic distribution on the labels [ @xcite ( @xcite ) , @xcite ] .",
    "this gibbs prior favors biclusters formed by similar genes in the sense of the distances or similarities chosen to build the relational graph .",
    "a similar prior relational graph may be built for the conditions if a notion of similarity between the conditions can be defined .",
    "this is the case , for example , when the conditions correspond to similar measurements taken over a period of time , such as in gene expression evolution ( i.e. , time - course ) profiles . in this case",
    ", the distance between conditions may incorporate a measure of smoothness of the time - course profile during consecutive measurements .",
    "alternatively , a measure of correlation may be incorporated in the similarities if a moving average or specific arma process is assumed on the time - course profiles .",
    "these aspects of the modeling processes are better explained within the context of specific applications , such as the ones described in section  [ sec : experiments ] . for the moment , assume that such a distance between conditions may be defined .",
    "we denote the distance between two conditions @xmath8 and @xmath83 by @xmath84 .",
    "the condition relational graph is defined to have edge weights equal to @xmath85 as before , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the temperature and kernel bandwidth parameters of the graph , respectively .",
    "and we assume that @xmath88 for pairs of conditions not connected by an edge .",
    "the distribution of the condition labels in this graph is then given by the binary auto - logistic distribution @xmath89\\\\[-8pt ] & \\doteq & \\exp \\biggl\\{\\sum^{q}_{j=1 } c_{j } \\kappa_{jk } + \\sum_{j \\sim j ' } d_{jj'}\\bigl(t^{\\kappa } , \\sigma_{\\kappa}\\bigr ) \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\kappa_{jk}=\\kappa _ { j'k}\\ } } \\biggr\\ } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 are hyperparameters that control the amount of condition membership ( @xmath17 ) in the bicluster .",
    "note that in the absence of any prior information on the dependency between conditions , we may assume that all pairs of conditions @xmath91 are far apart and , consequently , that @xmath88 for all pairs @xmath92 .",
    "this leads to a prior where all the condition labels @xmath13 are a priori independent .",
    "to estimate the posterior of the parameters , especially the one associated with the labels @xmath42 , we use a hybrid stochastic algorithm .",
    "first , an augmented model is considered in order to efficiently sample the labels through a block gibbs sampling .",
    "this is the swendsen ",
    "wang algorithm [ @xcite ] , which is well known in the physics and imaging literature .",
    "we briefly describe it hereafter .",
    "the effect and variance parameters are readily sampled using the usual gibbs sampler .",
    "however , the temperature hyperparameters associated with the label priors need extra consideration . in order to sample from their posterior , one needs to know the normalizing constant of the priors , which are unfortunately intractable . to solve this impasse",
    ", we adopt the wang  landau algorithm [ @xcite ] , which is a technique that efficiently samples from a grid of finite temperature values by cleverly estimating the normalizing constant at each iteration .",
    "the algorithm travels efficiently over all the temperatures by penalizing each visit .",
    "the resulting algorithm is also referred to as a flat - histogram algorithm .",
    "next , we further explain how the technique is applied to our model .",
    "let the number of biclusters @xmath16 be fixed .",
    "we denote the partial residuals by @xmath93 .",

    "this algorithm samples the labels in blocks by taking into account the neighborhood system of the data graph .",
    "it defines a set of the independent auxiliary @xmath98@xmath52 binary variables @xmath99 , called the bonds .",
    "the bonds are set to @xmath52 with label - dependent probabilities given by @xmath100 the bond @xmath101 is said to be _ frozen _ if @xmath102 .",

    "the answer lies at about one - half million iterations . a theoretical proof of the convergence of this algorithm is given in the supplementary material [ @xcite ] .    in step ( [ par ] ) ,",
    "the parameters @xmath123 are sampled with a gibbs sampler .",
    "the full conditional posterior of the parameters @xmath39 is straightforward to derive ; hence , it is not spelled out here . the temperatures @xmath112 ( and also the set @xmath168 , if appropriate ) are obtained by using the procedure of @xcite to elicit their prior critical temperatures from the random cluster models associated with the potts model .",
    "the kernel bandwidth parameters @xmath75 and @xmath87 are kept constant and set to the corresponding average nearest - neighbor distance [ @xcite ] .",
    "to build our simulated data sets , we used two different pools of genes : one from the yeast cycle data [ @xcite ] and the second from the retinal detachment ( rd ) data [ @xcite ] .    the yeast cycle data set shows the time - course fluctuation of the log - gene - expression - levels of 6000 genes over 17 time points .",
    "the data have been analyzed by several researchers [ @xcite ( @xcite ) , @xcite ] and are a classical example for testing clustering algorithms [ @xcite ] .",
    "we use the five - phase subset of this data , which consists of @xmath169 genes with expression levels that peak at different time points , corresponding to the five phases of the cell cycle . of the @xmath169 genes ,",
    "only @xmath170 are annotated with go terms .",
    "the rd data set is described in greater detail in section  [ sec : applications : rd ] .",
    "we used this data set so as to have simulations that resemble the rd data more closely .",
    "we randomly chose 2000 probe - sets ( i.e. , genes ) out of the 4645 probe - sets present in these data in order to study many scenarios for the simulated data .",
    "based on lin s pairwise similarities , discussed in section  [ sec : prior ] , we built corresponding relational graphs comprising the annotated genes .",
    "as with the real data , we simulated 38 conditions for the genes taken from the rd data set . recall that the rd data set consists of a group of 19 biopsies from patients with rd and a control group of 19 non - rd biopsies . as described in @xcite ,",
    "the patients can be further organized into three classes of rd : early stage ( rd @xmath171 month , 5 patients ) , mid - term stage ( @xmath52 month @xmath172 rd @xmath173 months , 7 patients ) and late stage ( rd @xmath174 months , 7 patients ) . the relational condition graph associated with the genes from the rd data set was built so that patients in the same group were related in the graph .",
    "the distances between patients in the same group were assumed to be the same .    for the genes taken from the yeast cycle data set , we simulated 17 conditions , the same number of conditions found in the real data .",
    "the modeling of the relational condition graph associated with these genes was inspired by the time dependency in the data .",
    "this allowed us to consider biclusters formed by consecutive conditions , which are easier to visualize .",
    "thus , for these simulated data , the similarity between conditions was induced by the correlation @xmath175 between time - consecutive conditions . the correlation distance between conditions",
    "was set to @xmath176 the value of the correlation parameter does not affect the relational structure given by the @xmath2-nearest - neighbor graph . in our simulations , we set @xmath177 . setting @xmath175 as an unknown parameter of the model",
    "would unnecessarily complicate the model because conducting inference on @xmath175 would involve knowledge of the normalizing constant , which in turns depends on @xmath175 and the temperature .",
    "a high value of @xmath175 should guide the model to consider clustering time - consecutive conditions together .    as our label prior favors common labels for genes or conditions that are strongly related in the graph , we used a hierarchical clustering ( e.g. , ward s minimum variance method [ @xcite ] ) with different tree cutoffs to generate labels for different numbers of biclusters .",
    "clusters that split at higher cutoffs in the tree were used as candidates for overlapping biclusters .",
    "the expression levels of the bicluster cells associated with the data for genes taken from the yeast cycle data were generated as follows : @xmath178 was generated from a normal@xmath179 distribution ; @xmath180 was generated from a normal@xmath181 , @xmath182 distribution ; the gene effects @xmath183 were generated as normal distributions , with the means equal to @xmath184 , and the variances equal to their prior variances , while keeping the constraint @xmath185 , @xmath45 ( see the last paragraph of section  [ sec : plaid : model ] on page  ) ; the condition effects @xmath186 were generated similarly ; and the variance @xmath187 was generated from an inverse-@xmath188 . in this fashion , we created data sets with the following numbers of biclusters : @xmath189 . each of these cases was replicated 15 times .",
    "figure  [ fig : simulated : data ] shows some examples of the simulated data for different values of  @xmath0 .",
    "the expression levels of the bicluster cells associated with the data for genes taken from the rd data set were generated in the same manner , except for the parameters @xmath190 that were generated from a normal distribution , with mean @xmath191 and variance @xmath192 . in this case",
    ", we created data sets with the following numbers of biclusters : @xmath193 .",
    "each of these cases was replicated 15 times .",
    "a measure of similarity between two sets of biclusters @xmath194 and @xmath195 is given by the so - called f1-measure [ @xcite ] .",
    "the f1-measure is an average between _ recall _ and _ precision _ , two measures of retrieval quality introduced in the text - mining literature [ @xcite ] .",
    "let @xmath196 be two biclusters , @xmath197 and @xmath198 be the number of genes in @xmath81 and @xmath199 , @xmath200 and @xmath201 be the number of conditions in @xmath81 and @xmath199 , and @xmath202 and @xmath203 be the number of elements in @xmath81 and @xmath199 , respectively .",

    "when several target biclusters ( or estimated biclusters ) @xmath206 are to be compared with known biclusters @xmath207 , we use the f1-measure average : @xmath208 .",
    "the estimated biclusters @xmath206 are obtained by using a threshold of 0.5 on the marginal posterior probabilities of the labels from our stochastic algorithm .",
    "we show the results of a performance comparison between the gibbs - plaid model and the bayesian penalized plaid model of @xcite for each number of biclusters considered .",
    "the penalized plaid model uses a parameter @xmath209 , which controls the amount of overlap of the biclusters .",
    "it extends the original plaid model of @xcite and the nonoverlapping model of @xcite , which arise as special cases of the penalized model when @xmath209 is set to zero and infinity , respectively .",
    "the case of @xmath210 is also equivalent to our gibbs - plaid model when the temperatures tend toward infinity ( i.e. , a model without prior interaction between the genes or between the conditions ) .",
    "@xcite fit their model with a gibbs sampler , and showed that its performance is much better than the performance of five other competitive biclustering methods : the samba algorithm of @xcite , the improved plaid model of @xcite , the algorithm of @xcite , the spectral algorithm of @xcite , and the fabia procedure of @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we extend this performance comparison by ( a ) including our gibbs - plaid model , ( b ) considering a larger and much more diverse pool of genes in the generation of data sets , and by ( c ) considering a larger number of biclusters in the simulations .",
    "the gibbs - plaid model was run with the stopping criterion suggested by @xcite , but with the maximum number of iterations fixed at @xmath211 .",
    "the penalized plaid model was run for @xmath212 iterations .",
    "for both models , we used the last @xmath213 samples after the burn - in period to perform the analysis and comparisons .",
    "we set the hyperparameters of the variables @xmath25 and @xmath66 as follows : @xmath214 , @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "figure  [ fig : yeast : rd : simulation ] shows the results .",
    "overall , the gibbs - plaid model performed better than the penalized plaid model and the other five biclustering algorithms .",
    "the difference in performance was much larger when the number of biclusters was large ( @xmath217 for the rd data and @xmath218 for the yeast data ) .",
    "we stress that these results apply to a large simulation involving very different pools of genes and types of conditions .",
    "note that with the rd data , the fabia algorithm did not work for cases with a large number of biclusters ( @xmath219 ) , and that the spectral algorithm did not find any biclusters for all cases ( data set replicates ) with @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath222 and @xmath223 , fabia found biclusters in only a single case out of 15 replicates .",
    "similarly , for @xmath224 and @xmath225 , the spectral algorithm found biclusters in only a single case .",
    "as in the work of @xcite , we used two model selection criteria to decide on the appropriate number of biclusters for each data set .",
    "we used the aic [ @xcite ] and the conditional dic ( dic@xmath226 ) , which was considered in @xcite and is given by @xmath227 + p_{c}\\bigl ( \\tilde{\\sigma}^2 , \\tilde{\\theta } , \\tilde{\\rho } , \\tilde{\\kappa } \\bigr),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath228 is the maximum a posteriori estimator of @xmath229 and @xmath230\\\\[-8pt ] & & \\qquad = -2e_{\\sigma^2,\\theta , \\rho , \\kappa } \\bigl[\\log p\\bigl(y| \\sigma^2 , \\theta,\\rho,\\kappa\\bigr)|y \\bigr]+2\\log p\\bigl(y|\\tilde { \\sigma}^2 , \\tilde{\\theta } , \\tilde{\\rho } , \\tilde{\\kappa}\\bigr),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the corresponding effective dimension .",
    "we computed the dic@xmath226 and aic criteria for all the simulated data for different values of @xmath0 . for the data generated from the yeast cycle data , we computed these criteria for @xmath231 biclusters . for the data generated with the rd data , we computed these criteria for @xmath232 biclusters when @xmath233 , for @xmath234 when @xmath221 , for @xmath235 when @xmath224 , and for @xmath236 when @xmath237 . figure  [ fig : dic : yeast : rd ] shows the model selection results for some of the simulated data sets .",
    "we note that , in general , aic and dic@xmath226 chose the same models for the small data sets generated with the pool of genes of the yeast cycle data .",
    "however , for the larger data sets generated with the pool of genes of the rd data , aic tended to reach a minimum before dic@xmath226 did , largely underestimating the true number of biclusters .",
    "this suggests an over - penalization of complex models by aic due to the large number of parameters induced by the large number of genes in the data sets .",
    "this behavior of aic has been noticed before [ @xcite ] . on the other hand",
    ", the elbow of the dic@xmath226 s curve ( that is , the start of the flattening of the dic@xmath226 s trajectories ) tended to occur at or after the minimum of the corresponding aic curves . in some cases ,",
    "the dic@xmath226 criterion reached a minimum at a number of biclusters that was larger than the true number of biclusters . a closer look at the extra biclusters revealed that they were , in general , very small , containing only a couple of conditions or a handful of genes .",
    "in addition , at the flattening of the dic@xmath226 curve , the dic@xmath226 s values were not ( statistically ) significantly different when we considered the errors in the dic@xmath226 s estimates ( the vertical segments crossing the curve correspond to plus or minus two standard deviations ; the standard deviations were estimated from 15 replicates ) .",
    "therefore , a possible rule of thumb is to select the biclustering model associated with a point in the flat part of the dic@xmath226 curve that falls near the elbow of the curve .",
    "this is the rule we applied in the simulations and in the application to a real data set , described hereafter .     for the gibbs - plaid model .",
    "the top row shows the results associated with the data sets generated for genes from the yeast cycle data ( @xmath238 , @xmath239 ) .",
    "the middle and bottom rows show the results associated with the data sets generated for genes from the rd data ( @xmath240 , @xmath241 ) .",
    "the bars correspond to plus or minus two standard deviations . ]",
    "in this section we show the application of our biclustering approach to the data gathered from a study in which 19 biopsy samples of rd were compared to 19 normal retinal samples [ @xcite ] .",
    "the data are available at ncbi / geo as gse28133 [ @xcite ] .",
    "the first step in microarray analysis consists in filtering for potentially relevant alterations in expression levels and removing any changes presumably due to the inherent noise of the system [ @xcite ] .",
    "such filtering aims at eliminating all genes whose expression measurements are very low , and to whom the resulting measures can be associated with random noise at detection - limit . in our case ,",
    "@xcite points out that the data is well described as a bimodal distribution where the first peak is associated with nonexpressed genes ( i.e. , where random noise at detection - limit was captured ) . in order to separate the random noise peak from the second peak of the bimodal distribution , we followed the exact same preprocessing procedure of @xcite and applied a threshold of 31.5 expression units to the expression data .",
    "only 32% of all probe - set expression values in the data were retained after the application of the threshold .",
    "fundamentally , this filtering step follows the belief that a gene which is not expressed in any of the samples studied can not present changes in expression rates in some samples and , therefore , all changes in the measures are due to random noise . therefore , we filtered out the genes / probe - sets with very low or constant expression values along all samples , which allowed us to concentrate on the highly reliable changes in the transcriptome , reduce the overall noise , and accelerate the subsequent calculations .",
    "a further gene filtering step was done based on the intuitive belief that if a gene expression standard deviation is too small , then the gene may have little discriminating strength ( e.g. , to discriminate between rd patients from healthy control ones ) and will be less likely to be selected .",
    "we studied the effects of performing this preprocessing step in a simulation study ( not shown here ) .",
    "we noticed that noisy genes not only increased the computational burden , but could also decrease the biclustering performance .",
    "after this filtering step , we obtained a data set of 4645 probe - sets with information for 3182 different genes ( multiple probe - sets may correspond to a single gene ) .",
    "we fit the gibbs - plaid biclustering model to these data .",
    "the dic criterion chose 47 biclusters , a value close to the elbow , whereas the aic criterion chose 11 biclusters , the value of the minimum aic .",
    "the size of the biclusters are shown in a series of histograms in figure  [ fig : rd : hist ] .",
    "the dic biclustering yielded a total of 20 biclusters that contained more than 80% of the rd samples , and 6 biclusters that contained more than 80% of the non - rd samples .",
    "in contrast , the aic biclustering yielded only 5 biclusters that contained more than 80% of the rd samples , and 3 biclusters that contained more than 80% of the non - rd samples .",
    "of the 20 dic - yielded biclusters with at least 80% of the rd samples , 18 contained 90% of the rd samples , and 15 contained only rd samples ( i.e. , they were purely rd sample biclusters ) .",
    "we are particularly interested in the `` _ significant _ '' biclusters because genes involved in these biclusters can be viewed as biomarkers that discriminate between the patients with rd and those without rd . in what follows",
    ", we refer to the biclusters that contain at least 80% of the rd samples or at least 80% of the non - rd samples as _ significant biclusters .",
    "_ of particular interest are dic biclusters 4 , 41 and 6 , which respectively consist of 95% , 91% and 84% of the rd samples .",
    "the degree of biclustering overlap and association among the significant biclusters may be better studied by computing the amount of shared elements ( either probe - sets or samples ) between each pair of biclusters .",
    "we computed the relative _ redundancy _ between each pair of biclusters as the average of the two ratios given by the number of shared elements and the corresponding bicluster sizes .",
    "as the dic produced a larger number of smaller biclusters , the corresponding results of biclustering showed less overlap ( i.e. , lower relative redundancy ) than the aic results ( see figure  [ fig : rd : hist ] ) .",
    "a more detailed inspection of the biclustering results ( see the supplementary material [ @xcite ] for complete biclustering results ) revealed that those produced using dic contained the most interesting enrichment of go ontologies related to photoreceptor cells ( i.e. , go ontologies `` go:0009416 response to light stimulus '' or further specialized branches of the previous go term , such as `` go:007603 phototransduction , visible light '' ) , which were found in dic bicluster 4 and somehow weaker in bicluster 6 ( dic biclusters 4 and 6 have a relative gene redundancy of 51.8% ) .",
    "some other interesting biclusters showed either enrichment of go ontology terms for inflammatory response ( bicluster 41 , which consists of 91% rd samples ) or for cell death ( bicluster 8 , which consists of only 54% rd samples ) .",
    "both types of responses have been previously described [ @xcite ] , but are not related to photoreceptor cells and are therefore less helpful in establishing a better understanding of the fate of photoreceptor cells .",
    "the biclusters obtained using aic had globally similar results with respect to enriched go ontologies",
    ". however , the terms related to vision and photoreceptor cells showed less dominant enrichment .",
    "in addition , this biclustering contains only a few `` significant '' biclusters .",
    "moreover , following our simulation results , the large difference in the number of biclusters suggested by aic and dic indicate that the dic results should be more reliable than those obtained from aic in this case .",
    "therefore , in the subsequent analysis , we focused on the results obtained using dic and , in particular , on bicluster 4 , which contained all the rd samples and only one non - rd sample .",
    "subsequent inspection of the protein interaction map , and , in both types of graphs , some nodes have a high number of connections while the majority has simply one or two connections .",
    "] for the proteins identified in dic bicluster 4 ( formed by 332 probe - sets and representing 301 different proteins ) was performed using the string database of documented protein - protein interactions [ @xcite ] .",
    "this is displayed in figure  [ fig : bicluster4:network ] ( see the supplementary material [ @xcite ] for a high - resolution image ) .",
    "on the basis of 301 proteins , we obtained a fairly small network of 50 directly interconnected proteins .",
    "we decided to construct an extended network by adding proteins that allowed us to link two or more of the 301 proteins from bicluster 4 , and for which the expression values were sufficiently high to call them unambiguously expressed genes .",
    "again , the threshold of 31.5 units described above and in @xcite was used so as to ensure that only genes with an unambiguous presence be considered for addition to the network .",
    "this approach has been successfully applied to identify proteins that are part of regulatory cycles and which are themselves not regulated at the level of transcription , but rather by either phosphorylation [ @xcite ] or proteins in the same pathway that are more weakly regulated . using this approach",
    ", we constructed an extended network of 50 proteins from the initial network and 68 additional proteins from bicluster 4 , which could then be connected to the network because of the addition of 192 novel proteins that were not present in bicluster 4 ( figure  [ fig : bicluster4:network ] ) .",
    "are surrounded ( highlighted ) by black rectangles . ]    in the extended network , the proteins identified in bicluster  4 are shown as large nodes , whereas the added proteins are shown as small nodes .",
    "all nodes ( proteins ) are divided into three regions that correspond to early , middle and late latency of rd .",
    "the regions are colored according to the change of gene expression values ( fold - change ) relative to the control group .",
    "the three respective fold - change values are displayed in a blue to red color scale ( saturated blue for down - regulation stronger than 6-fold ; saturated red for up - regulation stronger than 6-fold ) .",
    "it is important to note that the majority of proteins added to construct this extended network have node colors that are similar to the color of their neighbors originally identified in bicluster 4 .",
    "this confirms that adding these genes conserves well the overall structure of up- or down - regulated groups of proteins .",
    "several go ontology features are displayed in figure  [ fig : bicluster4:network ] according to the following shapes of the nodes : triangles display genes with `` go:0007601 visual perception , '' parallelograms , genes with `` go:0008219 cell death , '' and rectangles , genes with `` go:0006954 inflammatory response . ''",
    "no cases of multiple annotations combining any of these three terms were observed among the 310 proteins that form this network .",
    "genes annotated with other functions are shown as circles .",
    "proteins involved in cell death and inflammation were key results in the traditional analysis using @xmath1-tests [ @xcite ] .",
    "in contrast , proteins with these annotations are fairly rare in dic bicluster 4 , and are found in separate substructures of the enriched network when compared to the down - regulated genes annotated as being involved in visual perception .",
    "in fact , most other subnetworks based on dic bicluster 4 are somehow related to signaling , and thus reflect substantial biological and molecular activity in specimens of rd .",
    "one may note other relevant subnetworks , such as the one around rhou and arhgap30 ( framed by rectangles at the top left part of figure  [ fig : bicluster4:network ] ) , which is highly enriched in gtpases , which in turn are found at the very end of signaling pathways ; the subnetwork around mx1 and rnaf135 ( framed by rectangles at the bottom left part of figure  [ fig : bicluster4:network ] ) , which is enriched in up - regulated antiviral activity ; or the subnetwork around ppara , nr4a2 and nr2c1 ( framed by rectangles at the bottom right of figure  [ fig : bicluster4:network ] ) , which is enriched in mostly down - regulated nuclear receptors .",
    "the surprisingly strong antiviral activity subnetwork mentioned above may be involved in the general acute inflammatory response ; however , it has not been noted in the literature .",
    "alternatively , these findings may open novel perspectives for further detailed studies to investigate the potential participation of viral infections as risk factors for rd or as factors related to a worse prognosis at the onset of rd .",
    "we have proposed a model for biclustering that incorporates biological knowledge from the gene ontology ( go ) project and experimental conditions ( if available ) .",
    "we use this knowledge to specify prior distributions that account for the dependency structure between genes and between conditions .",
    "our goal was to determine whether using prior information on the genes and the conditions would improve the biological significance of the biclusters obtained from this method .",
    "we incorporated this prior information by efficiently modeling mutual interactions between genes ( or conditions ) with discrete gibbs fields . the pairwise interaction between the genes",
    "is given by entropy similarities estimated from go .",
    "these are embedded into a relational graph with nodes that correspond to genes and edges to similarities .",
    "the graph is kept sparse by filtering out gene interactions ( edges ) that arise from genes that do not share much common biological functionality as measured by go . in some cases , the conditions",
    "may also be compared by building a notion of similarity between them , for example , in the case of gene expression time courses .",
    "these similarities can also be represented by a corresponding relational graph . to our knowledge",
    ", the introduction of markov models and gibbs fields in the context of biclustering is new .",
    "however , this has already been attempted in the fields of clustering and regression .    in order to estimate the biclusters",
    ", we adopted a hybrid procedure that mixes the metropolis ",
    "hastings sampler with a variant of the wang  landau algorithm . to efficiently sample the labels through a block gibbs sampling",
    ", we used an algorithm based on the swendsen ",
    "wang algorithm .",
    "experiments on simulated data showed that our model is an improvement over other algorithms .",
    "they also showed that criteria based on the conditional dic and aic may be used to guide the choice of the number of biclusters .",
    "the application of gibbs - plaid biclustering to a data set created from rd research brings several advantages and novel insights . in comparison to previous efforts",
    ", we noted that biclustering is much more adaptive to biological settings , which are characterized by numerous proteins that have multiple functions and tissues or cells of interest that make use of multiple biological processes at the same time .",
    "a detailed inspection of the biclustering results allowed us to identify biclusters that are associated with all major known groups of cellular and molecular events . adding a protein - network component to these results revealed several previously unknown aspects of rd that lead to the generation of new hypotheses regarding : ( i ) proteins directly involved in subsequent changes in photoreceptor cells , and ( ii ) subnetworks of proteins potentially linked to these events .",
