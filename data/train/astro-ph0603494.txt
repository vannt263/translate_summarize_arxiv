    "neutrino cosmology is a fascinating example of the fecund interaction between particle physics and astrophysics . at the present time , the researchers working on neutrino physics know that the advances in this field need a combined effort in the two areas .    from the point of view of cosmologists ,",
    "the idea that massive neutrinos could play a significant role in the history of the universe and in the formation of structures has been discussed for more than thirty years , first as a pure speculation .",
    "however , nowadays we know from experimental results on flavour neutrino oscillations that neutrinos are massive .",
    "at least two neutrino states have a large enough mass for being non - relativistic today , thus making up a small fraction of the dark matter of the universe . at a stage in which cosmology reaches high precision thanks to the large amount of observational data , it is unavoidable to take into account the presence of massive neutrinos . in particular ,",
    "the observable matter density power spectrum is damped on small scales by massive neutrinos .",
    "this effect can range from a few per cent for @xmath0 ev masses , the minimal values of the total neutrino mass compatible with oscillation data , up to @xmath1 in the limit of three degenerate masses .    from the point of view of particle physicists",
    ", fixing the absolute neutrino mass scale ( or , equivalently , the lightest neutrino mass once the data on flavour oscillations are taken into account ) is the target of terrestrial experiments such as the searches for neutrinoless double beta decay or tritium beta decay experiments , a difficult task in spite of huge efforts and very promising scheduled experiments . at the moment , the best bounds come from the analysis of cosmological data , from the requirement that neutrinos did not wash out too much of the small - scale cosmological structures .",
    "recently the cosmological limits on neutrino masses progressed in a spectacular way , in particular thanks to the precise observation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite , and to the results of a new generation of very deep galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "neutrino physicists look with anxiety at any new development in this field , since in the next years many cosmological observations will be available with unprecedented precision .    at this very exciting moment , which might be preceding a breaking discovery within a few years , our aim is to present here a clear and comprehensive review of the role of massive neutrinos in cosmology , including a description of the underlying theory of cosmological perturbations , a summary of the current bounds and a review of the sensitivities expected for future cosmological observations .",
    "our main goal is to address this manuscript simultaneously to particle physicists and cosmologists : for each aspect , we try to avoid useless jargon and to present a self - contained summary .",
    "compared to recent short reviews on the subject , such as refs.@xcite , we tried to present a more detailed discussion . at the same time , we will focus on the case of three flavour neutrinos with masses in accordance with the current non - cosmological data .",
    "a recent review on primordial neutrinos can be found in @xcite , while for many other aspects of neutrino cosmology we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "finally , a more general review on the connection between particle physics and cosmology can be found in @xcite .",
    "we begin in sec .  [",
    "sec : numasses ] with an introduction to flavour neutrino oscillations , and their implications for neutrino masses in the standard three - neutrino scenario .",
    "we also briefly review the limits on neutrino masses from laboratory experiments .",
    "then , in sec.[sec : cnb ] , we describe some basic properties of the cosmic neutrino background . according to the big bang cosmological model ,",
    "each of the three flavour neutrinos were in thermal equilibrium in the early universe , and then decoupled while still relativistic .",
    "we review the consequences of this simple assumption for the phase - space distribution and number density of the relic neutrinos , and we summarize how this standard picture is confirmed by observations from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and cosmological perturbations .",
    "finally we explain why neutrinos are expected to constitute a fraction of the dark matter today .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : mass_cosmo ] , we describe the impact of massive neutrinos on cosmological perturbations . this section is crucial for understanding the rest , since current and future bounds rely precisely on the observation of cosmological perturbations .",
    "although the theory of cosmological perturbations is a very vast and technical topic , we try here to be accessible both to particle physicists willing to learn the field , and to cosmologists willing to understand better the specific role of neutrinos .",
    "we introduce the minimal number of concepts , technicalities and equations for understanding the main results related to neutrinos .",
    "still this section is quite long because we wanted to make it self - contained , and to explain many intermediate steps that are usually hidden in most works on the subject .    in sec .",
    "[ subsec : observables ] , we define the quantities that can be observed , i.e.  those that we want to compute . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : background ] , we describe the evolution of homogeneous quantities and in sec .",
    "[ subsec : gauge ] we define the general setup for the theory of cosmological perturbations . then in sec .",
    "[ subsec : pert_no_nu ] we described in a rather simplified way what the evolution of perturbations would look like in absence of neutrinos . for a cosmologist , these four sections are part of common knowledge and can be skipped . in sec .  [ subsec : pert_nu ] , we present a detailed description of the impact of neutrinos on cosmological perturbations . this long section is the most technical part of this work , so the reader who wants to avoid technicalities and to know the results can go directly to sec.[subsec : sum_mass - effect ] , for a comprehensive summary of the effects of neutrino masses on cosmological observables .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : present ] we review the current existing bounds on neutrino masses , starting from those involving only cmb observations , and then adding different sets of data on the distribution of the large scale structure ( lss ) of the universe , which include those coming from galaxy redshift surveys and the lyman-@xmath2 forest .",
    "we explain why a unique cosmological bound on neutrino masses does not exist , and why there are significant variations from paper to paper , depending on the data included and the assumed cosmological model .    finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : future ] we describe the prospects for the next ten or fifteen years .",
    "we summarize the forecasts which can be found in the literature concerning the sensitivity to neutrino masses of future cmb experiments , galaxy redshift surveys , weak lensing observations ( either from the cmb or from galaxy ellipticity ) and galaxy cluster surveys .",
    "we conclude with some general remarks in sec.[sec : concl ] .",
    "neutrinos have played a fundamental role in the understanding of weak interactions since they were postulated by w.  pauli in 1930 to safeguard energy conservation in beta decay processes .",
    "these chargeless leptons are massless in the framework of the succesful standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "however , this is an accidental prediction of the sm , and there are many well - motivated extended models where neutrinos acquire mass and other non - trivial properties ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "thus the measurement of neutrino masses could give us some hints on the new fundamental theory , of which the sm is just the low - energy limit , and in particular on new energy scales .",
    "it was realized by b.  pontecorvo in 1957 that if neutrinos were massive there could exist processes where the neutrino flavour is not conserved , that we call neutrino oscillations . for small neutrino masses ,",
    "these oscillations actually take place on macroscopic distances and can be measured if we are able to detect neutrinos from distant sources , identify their flavour and compare the results with the theoretical predictions for the initial neutrino fluxes .",
    "actually , after decades of experimental efforts in underground facilities , neutrinos have been detected from various natural or artificial sources .",
    "the former include the neutrinos produced in the nuclear reactions in the sun , as secondary particles from the interaction of cosmic rays in the atmosphere of the earth and even a few neutrinos were detected from a supernova explosion ( sn1987a ) .",
    "we have also measured the neutrino fluxes originated in artificial sources such as nuclear reactors or accelerators .",
    "nowadays there exist compelling evidences for flavour neutrino oscillations from a variety of experimental data on solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrinos .",
    "these are very important results , because the existence of flavour change implies that neutrinos mix and have non - zero masses , which in turn requires particle physics beyond the sm .",
    "there are many excellent reviews on neutrino oscillations and their implications , to which we refer the reader for more details ( see e.g.  the recent ones @xcite ) .    we know that the number of light neutrinos sensitive to weak interactions ( flavour or active neutrinos ) equals three from the analysis of the invisible @xmath3-boson width at lep , @xmath4 @xcite , and the three flavour neutrinos ( @xmath5 ) are linear combinations of states with definite mass @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of massive neutrinos .    in a three - neutrino scenario flavour and mass eigenstates",
    "are related by the mixing matrix @xmath8 , parametrized as @xcite @xmath9 here @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 or @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is a cp - violating phase . together with the three masses , in total there are seven flavour parameters in the neutrino sector",
    "this would be all if neutrinos were dirac particles , like the charged leptons , and the total lepton number is conserved . instead , if neutrinos are majorana particles ( i.e.  a neutrino is its own antiparticle ) , the matrix @xmath8 is multiplied by a diagonal matrix of phases that can be taken as @xmath15 .",
    "these two phases do not show up in neutrino oscillations , but appear in lepton - number - violating processes such as neutrinoless double beta decay , as discussed later .",
    "the two neutrino schemes allowed if @xmath16 : normal hierarchy ( nh ) and inverted hierarchy ( ih ) . ]    oscillation experiments can measure the differences of squared neutrino masses @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the relevant ones for solar and atmospheric neutrinos , respectively . as a reference , we take the following @xmath19 ranges of mixing parameters from an update of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath20 unfortunately oscillation experiments are insensitive to the absolute scale of neutrino masses , since the knowledge of @xmath21 and @xmath22 leads to the two possible schemes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuschemes ] , but leaves one neutrino mass unconstrained ( see e.g.  the discussion in the reviews @xcite ) .",
    "these two schemes are known as normal ( nh ) and inverted ( ih ) hierarchies , characterized by the sign of @xmath23 , positive and negative , respectively . for small values of the lightest neutrino mass @xmath24 ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) for nh ( ih ) , the mass states follow a hierarchical scenario , while for masses much larger than the differences all neutrinos share in practice the same mass and then we say that they are degenerate .",
    "in general , the relation between the individual masses and the total neutrino mass can be found numerically , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : numasses ] .",
    "expected values of neutrino masses according to the values in eq .",
    "( [ oscpardef ] ) . left : individual neutrino masses as a function of the total mass for the best - fit values of the @xmath27 .",
    "right : ranges of total neutrino mass as a function of the lightest state within the @xmath19 regions ( thick lines ) and for a future determination at the @xmath28 level ( thin lines ) . ]",
    "it is also possible that the number of massive neutrino states is larger than the number of flavor neutrinos .",
    "in such a case , in order to not violate the lep results the extra neutrino states must be sterile , i.e.  singlets of the sm gauge group and thus insensitive to weak interactions . at present",
    ", the results of the liquid scintillator neutrino detector ( lsnd ) @xcite , an experiment that has measured the appearance of electron antineutrinos in a muon antineutrino beam , constitute an independent evidence of neutrino conversions at a larger mass difference than those in eq.[oscpardef ] .",
    "in such a case , a fourth sterile neutrino is required with mass of @xmath29(ev ) @xcite .",
    "the lsnd results will be checked by the ongoing miniboone experiment @xcite , whose first data are expected for 2006 . in this review , we will mainly consider the three - neutrino scenario , but we briefly comment on the cosmological bounds on the four - neutrino mass schemes that include the lsnd results in sec.[subsec : extraparam ] .    as we discuss in the next sections ,",
    "cosmology is at first order sensitive to the total neutrino mass if all states have the same number density , providing information on @xmath24 but blind to neutrino mixing angles or possible cp violating phases .",
    "thus cosmological results are complementary to terrestrial experiments such as beta decay and neutrinoless double beta decay , which are respectively sensitive to the effective masses @xmath30 the search for a signal of non - zero neutrino masses in a beta decay experiment is , in principle , the best strategy for measuring directly the neutrino mass , since it involves only the kinematics of electrons ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the current limits from tritium beta decay apply only to the range of degenerate neutrino masses , so that @xmath31 ( if unitarity of @xmath8 is assumed ) .",
    "the bound at @xmath32 cl is @xmath33 ev from the troitsk @xcite and mainz @xcite experiments , respectively .",
    "this value is expected to be improved by the katrin project @xcite to reach a discovery potential for @xmath34 ev masses ( or a sensitivity of @xmath35 ev at @xmath36 cl ) .",
    "the neutrinoless double beta decay @xmath37 ( in short @xmath38 ) is a rare nuclear processes where lepton number is violated and whose observation would mean that neutrinos are majorana particles . if the @xmath38 process is mediated by a light neutrino , the results from neutrinoless double beta decay experiments are converted into an upper bound or a measurement of the effective mass @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ beta_2beta ] ) . a recent work @xcite gives the following upper bounds at @xmath40 cl @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a parameter that characterizes the uncertainties on the corresponding nuclear matrix elements ( see @xcite for a recent discussion and @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the above range corresponds to the results of recent double beta decay experiments based on @xmath43ge , such as heidelberg - moscow @xcite and igex @xcite , or @xmath44te such as cuoricino @xcite ( see e.g.@xcite for results from other isotopes ) .",
    "in addition , there exists a claim of a positive @xmath38 signal which would correspond to the approximate range @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "future @xmath38 projects will improve the current sensitivities down to values of the order @xmath46 ev @xcite .",
    "an experimental detection of @xmath38 , in combination with results from beta decay or cosmology , will also help us to discriminate between the two neutrino mass spectra and to pin down the values of the neutrino flavour parameters , as discussed for instance in @xcite .",
    "there are other ways to obtain information on the absolute scale of neutrino masses , such as the measurement of the time - of - flight dispersion of a supernova neutrino signal ( at most sensitive to masses of order some ev , see @xcite and references therein ) , but to conclude this section let us note that the sum of neutrino masses is restricted to the approximate range @xmath47 where the upper limit comes exclusively from tritium beta decay results and the lower limit reflects the minimum values of the total neutrino mass in the normal ( inverted ) hierarchy .",
    "the existence of a relic sea of neutrinos is a generic prediction of the standard hot big bang model , in number only slightly below that of relic photons that constitute the cmb .",
    "produced at large temperatures by frequent weak interactions , cosmic neutrinos were kept in equilibrium until these processes became ineffective in the course of the expansion . while coupled to the rest of the primeval plasma , neutrinos had a momentum spectrum with an equilibrium fermi - dirac form with temperature @xmath48 , @xmath49^{-1}\\ , .",
    "\\label{fd}\\ ] ] here we have included a neutrino chemical potential @xmath50 that would exist in the presence of a neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry , but it was shown in @xcite that the stringent bbn bounds on @xmath51 apply to all flavours , since neutrino oscillations lead to approximate flavour equilibrium before bbn .",
    "the current bounds on the common value of the neutrino degeneracy parameter @xmath52 are @xmath53 at @xmath54 @xcite ( relaxed to @xmath55 in presence of extra relativistic degrees of freedom @xcite ) .",
    "thus the contribution of a relic neutrino asymmetry can be safely ignored .",
    "as the universe cools , the weak interaction rate @xmath56 falls below the expansion rate given by the hubble parameter @xmath57 and one says that neutrinos decouple from the rest of the plasma .",
    "an estimate of the decoupling temperature can be found by equating the thermally averaged value of the weak interaction rate @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the cross section of the electron - neutrino processes with @xmath60 the fermi constant and @xmath61 is the neutrino number density , with the expansion rate @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the total energy density and @xmath64 is the planck mass .",
    "if we approximate the numerical factors to unity , with @xmath65 and @xmath66 , we obtain the rough estimate @xmath67 mev .",
    "more accurate calculations give slightly higher values of @xmath68 which are flavour dependent since electron neutrinos and antineutrinos are in closer contact with @xmath69 , as shown e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "although neutrino decoupling is not described by a unique @xmath70 , it can be approximated as an instantaneous process .",
    "the standard picture of _ instantaneous neutrino decoupling _ is very simple ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and reasonably accurate . in this approximation , the spectrum in eq .",
    "( [ fd ] ) is preserved after decoupling , since both neutrino momenta and temperature redshift identically with the universe expansion . in other words ,",
    "the number density of non - interacting neutrinos remains constant in a comoving volume since the decoupling epoch .",
    "we have seen in sec .",
    "[ sec : numasses ] that active neutrinos can not possess masses much larger than @xmath71 ev , so they were ultra - relativistic at decoupling .",
    "this is the reason why the momentum distribution in eq .",
    "( [ fd ] ) does not depend on the neutrino masses , even after decoupling , i.e.  there is no neutrino energy in the exponential of @xmath72 .",
    "when calculating quantities related to relic neutrinos , one must consider the various possible degrees of freedom per flavour .",
    "if neutrinos are massless or majorana particles , there are two degrees of freedom for each flavor , one for neutrinos ( one negative helicity state ) and one for antineutrinos ( one positive helicity state ) . instead , for dirac neutrinos there are in principle twice more degrees of freedom , corresponding to the two helicity states",
    ". however , the extra degrees of freedom should be included in the computation only if they are populated and brought into equilibrium before the time of neutrino decoupling . in practice , the dirac neutrinos with the `` wrong - helicity '' states do not interact with the plasma at temperatures of the mev order and have a vanishingly small density with respect to the usual left - handed neutrinos ( unless neutrinos have masses close to the kev range , as explained in sec .",
    "6.4 of @xcite , but such a large mass is excluded for active neutrinos ) .",
    "thus the relic density of active neutrinos does not depend on their nature , either dirac or majorana particles .    shortly after neutrino decoupling",
    "the photon temperature drops below the electron mass , favouring @xmath73 annihilations that heat the photons . if one assumes that this entropy transfer did not affect the neutrinos",
    "because they were already completely decoupled , it is easy to calculate the ratio between the temperatures of relic photons and neutrinos @xmath74 .",
    "any quantity related to relic neutrinos can be calculated at later times with the spectrum in eq .",
    "( [ fd ] ) and @xmath75 .",
    "for instance , the number density per flavour is fixed by the temperature , @xmath76 which leads to a present value of @xmath77 neutrinos and antineutrinos of each flavour per @xmath78 . instead",
    ", the energy density for massive neutrinos should in principle be calculated numerically , with two well - defined analytical limits , @xmath79 thus we see that the contribution of massive neutrinos to the energy density in the non - relativistic limit is a function of the mass ( or the sum of masses if all neutrino states have @xmath80 ) .",

    "right : contribution of the distortions to the comoving number density . here",
    "the scale factor was normalized so that @xmath82 at large temperatures . ]    in a more accurate analysis of neutrino decoupling , the standard picture described above is modified : the processes of neutrino decoupling and @xmath73 annihilations are sufficiently close in time so that some relic interactions between @xmath73 and neutrinos exist .",
    "these relic processes are more efficient for larger neutrino energies , leading to non - thermal distortions in the neutrino spectra and a slightly smaller increase of the comoving photon temperature , as noted in a series of works ( see the full list given in the review @xcite ) . a proper calculation of the process of non - instantaneous neutrino decoupling demands solving the boltzmann equations for the neutrino spectra , a set of integro - differential kinetic equations that are difficult to solve numerically .",
    "the momentum - dependent calculations were carried out in refs.@xcite , while the inclusion of finite temperature qed corrections to the electromagnetic plasma was done in @xcite .    a recent work @xcite has considered the effect of flavour neutrino oscillations on the neutrino decoupling process ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the frozen values of the neutrino distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : finalfnu ] , for the cases calculated with and without the effect of flavour oscillations .",
    "one can see that the distortions grow with the neutrino momentum , and their contribution to the number density of neutrinos is maximal around @xmath83 . for the best - fit values of the mixing parameters in eq .",
    "( [ oscpardef ] ) , ref .",
    "@xcite found an increase in the neutrino energy densities of @xmath84 and @xmath85 for @xmath86 s and @xmath87 s , respectively . at the same time , after @xmath69 annihilations the comoving photon temperature is a factor @xmath88 larger , instead of @xmath89 in the approximation of instantaneous decoupling .",
    "note , however , that for any cosmological epoch when neutrino masses can be relevant one should consider the spectra of the neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath90 instead of flavour eigenstates @xmath91 . in principle , for numerical calculations of the cosmological perturbation evolution such as those done by the boltzmann codes cmbfast @xcite or camb @xcite , one should include the full distribution function of each mass eigenstate , including the distortions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : finalfnu ] .",
    "it is only when the neutrinos are relativistic or when one is interested in an observable that does not depend on neutrino masses ( such as the number density ) that the effect of the distortion can be simply integrated over momentum .",

    "for instance , large objects such as superclusters of galaxies form first , while smaller structures like clusters and galaxies form via a fragmentation process .",
    "this top - down scenario is at odds with the fact that galaxies seem older than clusters .    given the failure of hdm - dominated scenarios , the attention then turned to cold dark matter ( cdm ) candidates , i.e.  particles which were non - relativistic at the epoch when the universe became matter - dominated , which provided a better agreement with observations .",
    "still in the mid-1990s it appeared that a small mixture of hdm in a universe dominated by cdm fitted better the observational data on density fluctuations at small scales than a pure cdm model ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "this field has been thoroughly investigated over the past thirty years , and many excellent reviews have been written on the subject ( see for instance refs.@xcite ) .",
    "many equations in this section are reminiscent of those in ma & bertschinger  @xcite and bertschinger@xcite  however , with several sign differences , since we choose the metric signature to be @xmath128 .",
    "this signature tends to be the most popular nowadays in cosmology .    in our universe ,",
    "the metric and the energy - momentum tensor are inhomogeneous .",
    "their perturbations , given by @xmath129 are known to be small in the early universe , typically @xmath130 times smaller than the background quantities , as shown by cmb anisotropies . as we shall see in this section , after photon decoupling , the matter perturbations grow by gravitational collapse and reach the non - linear regime , starting with the smallest scales . however , the linear perturbation theory is a good tool both for describing the early universe at any scales , and the recent universe on the largest scales .",
    "the most reliable observations in cosmology are those involving mainly linear ( or quasi - linear ) perturbations .",
    "in particular , current cosmological neutrino mass bounds are based on such observations .",
    "therefore , our goal in this section is to describe the evolution of linear cosmological perturbations .",
    "the great advantage of linear theory is , as usual , to obtain independent equations of evolution for each fourier mode .",
    "note that the fourier decomposition must be performed with respect to the comoving coordinate system : so , the quantity @xmath131 is the _ comoving wavelength _ of a perturbation of wavevector @xmath132 , while the _ physical wavelength _ is given by @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the scale factor of the universe . for each mode @xmath135 ,",
    "the perturbation amplitudes evolve under some equations of motion ( which depend only on the modulus @xmath136 , since the background is isotropic ) , and on top of this evolution , the physical wavelength is stretched according to the universe expansion .    for concision",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the main - stream standard cosmological model : the inflationary @xmath127cdm scenario , whose background evolution is reviewed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : background ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : present ] we will briefly comment on some results based on more exotic scenarios .",
    "however , the theory of cosmological perturbations is so rich that in order to present a short and pedagogical summary , it is necessary to start from strong assumptions concerning the underlying cosmological background .",
    "therefore , we will assume that at early times ( e.g.  at bbn ) the universe contains a stochastic background of gaussian , adiabatic and nearly scale - invariant primordial perturbations , as predicted by inflation , and as strongly suggested by cmb observations .",
    "since the perturbations are stochastic and gaussian , what we will call `` amplitude '' should often be understood as `` variance '' : the linear equations of evolution give the evolution of each individual mode @xmath137 of a perturbation @xmath138 , and also , more interestingly , that of the root mean square @xmath139 , obtained by averaging over all modes of fixed wavenumber @xmath136 .",
    "it is this last quantity which is the target of most observations , and which carries information on the cosmological parameters .",
    "the perturbations defined in eqs .",
    "( [ def_perturb ] ) contain many degrees of freedom : the homogeneity and isotropy of the background implies that @xmath140 and @xmath141 are diagonal , but in general this is not true at the level of perturbations .",
    "however , we will see in sec .",
    "[ subsec : gauge ] that some of these degrees of freedom are just artifacts of the relativistic perturbation theory set - up ; moreover , only a fraction of the physical degrees of freedom contribute significantly to the cmb and lss observables .",
    "so , we will see at the end of sec.[subsec : gauge ] that the problem can be reduced to the integration of a small number of linear equations of evolution .",
    "in order to perform this integration , one must specify the properties of each fluid contributing to the energy density .",
    "apart from the cosmological constant , the standard @xmath127cdm scenario includes contributions from photons , neutrinos , baryons and cold dark matter . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : pert_no_nu ] , we will review the behavior of the most relevant perturbations under the assumption that neutrinos are absent , in order to better identify the specific role of neutrinos in sec .",
    "[ subsec : pert_nu ] . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : sum_mass - effect ] , we will summarize the effects of neutrino masses on cosmological observables , which are important for understanding the present bounds .",
    "thus , the reader already familiar with cosmological perturbation theory in @xmath127cdm and @xmath127mdm ( @xmath127 mixed dark matter ) models can go directly to the last subsection .",
    "our goal is to compute observable quantities like    * the cmb temperature anisotropy power spectrum , defined as the angular two - point correlation function of cmb maps @xmath142 ( @xmath143 being a direction in the sky ) .",
    "this function is usually expanded in legendre multipoles @xmath144 where @xmath145 are the legendre polynomials .",
    "so , for gaussian fluctuations , all the information is encoded in the multipoles @xmath146 which probe correlations on angular scales @xmath147 . since for each neutrino family the mass is already known to be at most of the order of @xmath71 ev ( see sec .  [ sec : present ] ) , the transition to the non - relativistic regime is expected to take place after the time of recombination between electrons and nucleons , i.e. after photon decoupling .",
    "the shape of the cmb spectrum is related mainly to the physical evolution _ before _ recombination .",
    "therefore , the cmb will only be marginally affected by the neutrino mass ( we will see later that there is only an indirect effect through the modified background evolution ) .",
    "for this reason , we will only mention in this review some essential aspects of the cmb temperature spectrum , without entering into details .",
    "for the effects on cmb of heavier neutrinos ( with masses of a few ev ) , we refer the reader to ref .  @xcite . + * the cmb polarization anisotropy power spectra bring interesting complementary information to the temperature one , but for the same reasons as above , plus the fact that current polarization measurements are still rather imprecise , we will not discuss polarization in this section . + * the matter power spectrum , observed with various techniques described in the next section ( directly or indirectly , today or in the near past ) , probes the current large scale structure of the universe .",
    "it is defined as the two - point correlation function of non - relativistic matter fluctuations in fourier space @xmath148 where @xmath149 . in the case of several fluids ( e.g. cdm , baryons and non - relativistic neutrinos ) , the total matter perturbation can be expanded as @xmath150 since the energy density is related to the mass density of non - relativistic matter through @xmath151 , @xmath152 represents indifferently the energy or mass power spectrum . when the redshift @xmath153 is not explicitly written , we assume that @xmath154 refers to the matter power spectrum evaluated today ( at @xmath155 ) .",
    "the shape of the matter power spectrum is the key observable for constraining small neutrino masses with cosmological methods .",
    "therefore the main purpose of this section is to review the physics responsible for its shape , in a pedagogical but sufficiently detailed way , starting with linear structure formation in absence of neutrinos ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : pert_no_nu ] ) , and then including the impact of free - streaming massive neutrinos ( secs .",
    "[ subsec : pert_nu ] , [ subsec : sum_mass - effect ] ) .",
    "+ * finally , one can build some cross - correlation power spectra ( which measure the angular or spatial correlation between two different types of observables ) .",
    "these correlations are in principle very interesting to extract from observations , since they provide some additional information beyond that contained in the self - correlation power spectra @xmath146 or @xmath154 .",
    "for instance , the cross - correlation between cmb temperature and polarization maps is non - zero , since the two signals are affected by the same physical inhomogeneities close to the last - scattering surface .",
    "the cmb temperature maps are also correlated to some extent to the matter distribution at low redshift , due to the late integrated sachs - wolfe effect ( that we will briefly introduce in sec .",
    "[ subsec : params ] )",
    ". finally , different measurements of the matter distribution in different overlapping redshift ranges or with different techniques are likely to be correlated with each other .",
    "the measurement of various cross - correlation power spectra is expected to be crucial in the future , but since nowadays it only plays a marginal role in neutrino mass determinations  @xcite , we will not introduce the corresponding formalism in this review .      in most of this section , we will use the conformal time @xmath156 instead of the proper time @xmath157 .",
    "the two are related through @xmath158 .",
    "a dot will denote a derivative with respect to @xmath156 .",
    "for instance , the hubble parameter reads @xmath159 . in absence of spatial curvature ,",
    "the background friedmann metric reduces to @xmath160~ , \\label{friedmann_metric}\\ ] ] and the friedmann equation reads @xmath161 where the homogeneous density of photons @xmath162 scales like @xmath163 , that of non - relativistic matter ( @xmath164 for cdm and @xmath165 for baryons ) like @xmath166 , that of neutrinos @xmath167 interpolates between the two behaviors at the time of the non - relativistic transition , and finally the cosmological constant density @xmath168 is of course time - independent . at any time , the critical density @xmath169 is defined as @xmath170 , and the current value @xmath171 ( or reduced value @xmath112 ) of the hubble parameter gives the critical density today @xmath172    the normalization of the scale factor @xmath173 is arbitrary .",
    "if we first neglect neutrino masses , the photon and neutrino densities can be combined into a total radiation density @xmath174 scaling like @xmath163 , while the cdm and baryons combine into a matter density @xmath175 scaling like @xmath166 .",
    "then , we can choose the normalization of @xmath173 such that @xmath176 in order to obtain a particularly simple friedmann equation valid during radiation domination ( rd ) and matter domination ( md ) @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the scale factor at equality , when @xmath179 .",
    "there is a simple solution , @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the value of the conformal time at equality . at low redshift ( typically @xmath182 ) ,",
    "the cosmological constant density takes over , causing a departure from the above solution , with an acceleration of the scale factor . finally ,",
    "if we include the effect of small neutrino masses , the solution is also slightly modified , since the non - relativistic transition of each neutrino species amounts in converting a fraction of radiation into matter .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_i ] , where we plot the evolution of background densities for a @xmath127mdm model in which the three neutrino masses follow the normal hierarchy scheme ( see sec .",

    "we show the densities to the power @xmath191 ( in ev units ) as a function of the scale factor . on the right plot , we display the evolution of the density fractions ( i.e. , the densities in units of the critical density ) .",
    "we also show on the top axis the neutrino temperature ( on the left in ev , and on the right in kelvin units ) .",
    "the density of the neutrino mass states @xmath192 and @xmath193 is clearly enhanced once they become non - relativistic . on the left plot",
    ", we also display the characteristic times for the end of bbn and for photon decoupling or recombination . ]      in the real universe all physical quantities ( densities , curvature ... ) are functions of time and space .",
    "thanks to the covariance of general relativity , they can be described in principle in any coordinate system , without changing the physical predictions .",
    "the problem is that in order to obtain simple equations of evolution , we wish to use a linear perturbation theory , in which the true physical quantities are artificially decomposed into a homogeneous background and some small perturbations .",
    "this is artificial because the homogeneous quantities are defined as spatial averages over hypersurfaces of simultaneity : @xmath194 .",
    "any change of coordinate system which    1 .",
    "mixes time and space ( therefore , redefining hypersurfaces of simultaneity , and changing the way to perform spatial averages ) , and + 2 .   remains small everywhere , so that the differences between true quantities and spatial averages are still small perturbations ,    gives a new set of perturbations ( new equations of evolution , new initial conditions ) , although the physical quantities ( i.e. , the total ones ) are the same .",
    "this ambiguity is called the _ gauge freedom _ in the context of relativistic perturbation theory .    of course",
    ", using a linear perturbation theory is only possible when there exists at least one system of coordinates in which the universe looks approximately homogeneous .",
    "we know that this is the case at least until the time of photon decoupling : in some reference frames , the cmb anisotropies do appear as small perturbations . it is a necessary condition for using linear theory to be in such a frame ; however , this condition is vague and leaves a lot of gauge freedom , i.e.  many possible ways to slice the spacetime into hypersurfaces of simultaneity .",
    "we can also notice that the definition of hypersurfaces of simultaneity is not ambiguous at small distances , as long as different observers can exchange light signals in order to synchronize their clocks .",
    "intuitively , we see that the gauge freedom is an infrared problem , since on very large distances ( larger than the hubble distance ) the word `` simultaneous '' does not have a clear meaning . the fact that the gauge ambiguity is only present on large scales emerges naturally from the mathematical framework describing gauge transformations .",
    "formally , a gauge transformation is described by a quadrivector field @xmath195 ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "when the latter is infinitesimal , the lorentz scalars , vectors and tensors describing the perturbations are shifted by the lie derivative along @xmath196 , @xmath197~.\\ ] ] since there are four degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) in this transformation - the four components of @xmath198 - we see that among the ten d.o.f . of the perturbed einstein equation @xmath199 ,",
    "four represent gauge modes , and six represent physical degrees of freedom .",
    "in addition , it can be shown that this equation contains three decoupled sectors .",
    "in other words , when the metric and the energy - momentum tensor are parametrized in an adequate way , the ten equations can be decomposed into three systems independent of each other :    1 .",
    "four equations relate four scalars in the perturbed metric @xmath200 to four scalars in @xmath201 , + 2 .",
    "four equations relate two transverse 3-vectors in the perturbed metric ( 4 d.o.f . in total ) to two transverse 3-vectors in @xmath201 , + 3 .",
    "two equations relate one transverse traceless @xmath202-tensor in the perturbed metric ( 2 d.o.f .  in total ) to a similar tensor in @xmath201 .    moreover , this decomposition is left invariant by gauge transformations .",
    "these three types of variables are called scalar , vector and tensor modes ; physically , they describe respectively the generalization of newtonian gravity , gravitomagnetism , and gravitational waves . it can be shown that two scalar d.o.f . and two vector d.o.f .",
    "are gauge modes , so each of the three sectors contains only two physical d.o.f . in principle",
    ", all modes can contribute to the cmb anisotropy maps , but cmb observations show that the vector and tensor contributions are negligible ( at least for temperature anisotropies ) . as for the lss of the universe ,",
    "it is related to the mass / energy density distribution of non - relativistic matter , i.e. , again to the scalar sector .",
    "therefore , in this report , we will focus only on scalar perturbations , not because the cosmological backgrounds of vector / tensor modes are insensitive to neutrino properties , but because they are not likely to be observed with great precision in a near future .",
    "it is possible to build some gauge - invariant combinations , and to reduce the einstein equation into a set of gauge - invariant equations .",
    "this is not the most economic way to proceed : one can simply choose an arbitrary gauge - fixing condition , i.e. , a prescription that will limit the number of effective degrees of freedom to that of physical modes only , and make all calculations into that gauge .",
    "when the same problem is studied in two different gauges , the solutions can look very different on large wavelength ; for instance , the total energy density perturbation @xmath203 for a given time and wavenumber can appear as growing in one gauge , and constant in another gauge , although the two solutions describe the same universe .",
    "however , physical observables - like the matter density perturbations probed by galaxy surveys or temperature / polarization anisotropies probed by cmb experiments - are always limited to small scales , at most of the order of the hubble length . on those scales ,",
    "the predictions arising from different gauge choices always coincide with each other .    throughout our discussion",
    ", we choose to work in the longitudinal gauge , which is probably the most popular for studying cosmological perturbations . in this gauge ,",

    ", the perfect fluid approximation does not apply to this situation , since on the one hand photons become collisionless after decoupling , and on the other hand cold dark matter is collisionless at any time ( so it can not even be called a fluid ) .",

    "( [ tmunuperfect ] , [ umu ] ) in an effective way .    first , after its own decoupling time , the cold dark matter component is always non - relativistic and collisionless .",
    "as long as the bulk motion of cdm particles can be described by a single - valued flow , the cdm energy - momentum tensor is formally identical to that of a perfect fluid with density @xmath235 and zero pressure .",
    "second , let us discuss the case of photons and baryons . if our purpose was to review the cmb physics , it would be crucial to introduce separately the exact form of the photon and baryon energy - momentum tensors .",

    "the local value of @xmath237 is related to the local value of the photon blackbody temperature .",
    "the bulk velocity of this fluid remains small enough to use eqs.([umu ] ) .",
    "after recombination , the photons are irrelevant for structure formation , and we will simply discard this component ; the baryons behave like a non - relativistic collisionless medium , but for simplicity we will neglect their density with respect to that of cold dark matter .",
    "finally , since we are only interested in scalar perturbations , we can reduce the bulk velocities of radiation and cdm into irrotational vector fields , and define two scalars @xmath238 and @xmath239 as in eq .",

    "however , bayesian results can not be interpreted in the same way as frequentist ones , and there are significant differences that should be kept in mind :    * bayesian inference always produce some confidence intervals , even if the assumed model is unable to provide good fits to the data .",
    "the results of a bayesian analysis contain no statements on the goodness - of - fit of the model .",
    "therefore , most authors provide some complementary information , like the maximum value of the likelihood @xmath725 ( or equivalently , the minimum value of the effective @xmath726 , which is defined  even for a non - gaussian likelihood  as @xmath727 )",
    ". then , it is possible to estimate in the frequentist way how good is the best fit . + * for each parameter , the best - fit value @xmath728 generally differs from the most likely value @xmath729 .",

    ". they can be quite different , for instance if for @xmath696 fixed to @xmath728 there are many bad fits and very few excellent fits , while for @xmath696 fixed to @xmath729 there are many good ones . in a future analysis",
    ", it would be conceivable that the best - fit value of the total neutrino mass be zero , while the most likely value be strictly positive .",
    "this is a natural outcome of the bayesian approach , which is based on probability distributions in parameter space , and therefore favours regions in which models are good _ in average_. + * the exact meaning of a bayesian confidence interval is : `` given a particular underlying model and given the data , it is likely to be in this region , and unlikely to be outside '' .",
    "one should be careful not to over - interpret a bayesian confidence interval .",
    "it is risky to say that a parameter value sitting outside of the interval is excluded .",
    "first , it is possible that with such a value one can find a very good fit to the data ( in the frequentist sense ) : the bayesian analysis could penalize this point just because the well - fitting region has a tiny volume in the subspace of parameters to be marginalized over .",
    "second , one could possibly assume another model ( with extra free parameters ) in which the same parameter value would be comfortably allowed . in summary ,",
    "bayesian confidence intervals are well - defined , but they are attached to a particular underlying model .",
    "it makes no sense to quote a bayesian upper limit , e.g.  on the neutrino masses , without explicitly specifying the model assumed .",
    "+ * in the frequentist approach , adding more data always lead to stronger bounds on each parameter , while adding more free parameters can only enlarge the allowed region . in the bayesian approach , this is true in general but not always : it is easy to build counter - examples , as we did in fig .",
    "[ fig_stat ] .",
    "again , bayesian inference offers many advantages for cosmological parameter extraction , and the previous items should not be regarded as criticisms , but rather as a list of warnings for correctly interpreting the results quoted in this section .",
    "the experimental situation of the measurement of the cmb anisotropies changed radically with the first year release of wmap data ( wmap1 ) , that includes the temperature @xmath730 temperature ( tt ) @xcite and temperature @xmath730 e - polarization ( te ) @xcite correlation functions .",
    "the recent third - year release ( wmap3 ) improves the tt and te power spectra @xcite , and adds a detection of the e - polarization self - correlation spectrum ( ee ) @xcite . the wmap experiment measured with high precision the tt spectrum on large angular scales ( @xmath731 ) , while at similar or smaller scales we have results from experiments that are either ground - based such as the arcminute cosmology bolometer array receiver ( acbar ) @xcite , the very small array ( vsa ) @xcite , the cosmic background imager ( cbi ) @xcite and the degree angular scale interferometer ( dasi ) @xcite , or balloon - borne such as archeops @xcite , boomerang ( tt @xcite , te @xcite and ee @xcite ) and maxima @xcite .",
    "when using data from different cmb experiments , one should take into account that they overlap in some multipole region , and not all data are uncorrelated .",
    "small neutrino masses only have a small influence on the power spectrum of cmb anisotropies , since for @xmath596 smaller than approximately @xmath732 ev the neutrinos are still relativistic at the time of recombination , so that their direct effect on the cmb perturbations is identical to that of massless neutrinos .",
    "however , the signature of a mass smaller than @xmath732 ev does not vanish : we recalled in sec.[subsec : sum_mass - effect ] that there is always a background effect , proportional to @xmath120 , which changes some characteristic times and scales in the evolution of the universe , and affects mainly the amplitude of the first acoustic peak as well as the location of all the peaks , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_powspec_lmdm ] and [ fig_powspec_deg ] . therefore , it is possible to constrain neutrino masses using cmb experiments only , down to the level at which this background effect is masked by instrumental noise , or by cosmic variance , or by parameter degeneracies in the case of some cosmological models beyond the minimal @xmath127 mixed dark matter ( @xmath127mdm ) framework .",

    "a detection at a significant level of the minimal value of the total neutrino mass in the inverted hierarchy scheme will demand the combination of future data from cmb lensing and cosmic shear surveys , whose more ambitious projects will provide a 2@xmath220 sensitivity to the minimal value in the case of normal hierarchy ( of order @xmath757 ev ) . the combination of cmb observations with future galaxy cluster surveys ( derived from the same weak lensing observations , as well as x - ray and sunyaev ",
