    "recently , classical solutions of the born - infeld ( bi ) action , which is considered as the world - volume action of the d - brane , have been studied  @xcite in the flat background - space .",
    "they are classified into the bps and non - bps solutions .",
    "the stable bps solutions are interpreted as the strings which connect two d - branes separated by the infinite distance . while the non - bps solutions are not protected from the dynamical fluctuations since they are not supersymmetric one . among them , non - bps solutions with pure electric charge have attracted an attention @xcite .",
    "it can be regarded as the half - part of the string which connects brane and anti - brane with a finite distance to form a bound state of them .",
    "the stability of such a non - bps configuration has been studied from a viewpoint of the quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to examine these solutions from a viewpoint of the @xmath2 yang - mills theory which can be constructed by the stack of d3-branes . in this direction ,",
    "some progress has been given by studying the world - volume action of test brane embedded in the background of d - branes @xcite .",
    "the situation of the symmetry breaking @xmath3 is realized by setting one of the branes far away from the others .",
    "then we can say that the classical solutions of the world - volume action represent the soliton solutions such as monopoles or dyons appearing in the non - abelian yang - mills theory .",
    "it would be meaningful to study the non - bps solutions which are non - supersymmetric solution obtained in the background of the type - iib superstring theory , because they are expected to play some role in the non - supersymmetric yang - mills theory .",

    "even if we consider the supersymmetric case , the fermionic coordinates are not necessary to obtain a classical solution of the d - brane action .",

    "( ii ) the form of the bps solution obtained is independent on the parameter of the background since it is not deformed by the background configurations .",
    "( iii ) the effect of the background configuration appears indirectly through the induced world - volume metric in the brane action .",
    "namely , @xmath54 has a minimum value , @xmath93 @xcite , where the solution touches the opposite brane(s ) since @xmath94 . at this point ,",
    "the proper distance in the world - volume of the brane becomes infinite since the induced metric diverges .",

    "it is expected that this object with a finite energy would appear as a dyon in the yang - mills theory .",
    "we now turn to the non - bps solutions .",
    "as seen in the subsection 4.1 , the non - bps solutions obtained in the flat space are separated into two groups from their property .",
    "one is the pure electric string which connects to the anti - brane to form a bound state .",
    "the second is the dyonic string which could arrive at the other brane(s ) at the infinite distance . in the case of the finite distance also",
    ", these two types of solutions can be found by taking other ansatz than the one given in the previous section , ( [ ansatz2 ] ) .",

    "( [ eqx22 ] ) and ( [ sol1 ] ) , x+2rx-x2(d)= , [ eqx4 ] where d=1+hx^2 1+h(a_2/r^2)^2 .",
    "it is easily seen that eq .",
    "( [ eqx4 ] ) is reduced to the equation of the flat background in the limit of @xmath86 @xmath97 .",
    "in fact , we obtain the following solution for @xmath86 , x=c_1/r^2 , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are constants depending on the boundary conditions .",
    "this is equivalent to the solution ( [ eq:18 ] ) .    while eq .",
    "( [ eqx4 ] ) for @xmath79 is highly nonlinear , so it is difficult to solve it analytically .",
    "then we give the solutions numerically .",
    "the resultant solutions are shown in fig .",
    "3 , where the bps solution , @xmath100 , is also shown by the dotted line for the comparison . in the fig.3 , two types of non - bps solutions are seen .",
    "they are obtained here by giving the boundary conditions at an appropriate point ( @xmath101 ) as x(r_b)=a_2r_b  ,  x(r_b)=-  , where @xmath102 is a parameter .",
    "the solutions of the first group @xmath103 are obtained for @xmath104 , and the second group @xmath105 are for @xmath106 .",
    "we notice that the bps solution is obtained for @xmath107 . in this sense ,",
    "the bps solution is the critical one which separates the two types of solutions .",
    "the first type of solution covers all region of @xmath54 , and it ends at @xmath108 with finite value of @xmath109 and negative value of @xmath110 .",
    "so the shape of this configuration has a cusp at @xmath108 and the configuration is singular at this point .",
    "the second type of solution is bounded as @xmath111 , where @xmath112 varies depending on the boundary conditions and @xmath113 . due to this property",
    ", the solution can be connected to the other half with the opposite orientation @xcite to make the bound state of brane and anti - brane .",
    "these solutions have the same qualitative properties with the one obtained in the flat background .",
    "however they are affected by the non - trivial background in the present case .",
    "the most prominent influence is seen in the fact that these solutions could not reach at the position of the other brane(s ) , @xmath114 .",
    "this is understood as follows . from eqs .",
    "( [ det ] ) and ( [ sol1 ] ) , we obtain f^2=h^-1+x^2 h^-1(r^2/a_2)^2 + 1 .",
    "then we find the relation @xmath115 at @xmath114 , where @xmath116 , and we obtain the bps solution from this condition .",

    "so there is no non - bps electric string state , which connect two parallel branes with a finite energy .",

    "this implies that the bound state of the brane and anti - brane would be pushed to vanish through the annihilation of them near the branes .",
    "next , we consider the dyonic non - bps string configurations under the d - brane background .",
    "the equation for this solution is obtained by taking the ansatz ( [ eq:19 ] ) , @xmath118 which is given in the section 3.1 to obtain the dyonic solution in the flat background . in the present case ,",

    "we solve the differential equation numerically .",
    "we firstly discuss the dyonic solutions which are corresponding to the solutions @xmath120 in fig.3 at the limit of @xmath121 . namely we take the same boundary conditions with the one of @xmath120 in fig.3 in solving the equation considered here for @xmath122 . in fig.5 ,",

    "the @xmath78-dependence of the solutions is seen from the fig.5 , and the behaviors are similar to the case of the flat background .",

    "this @xmath117-dependence is the main difference from the bps solutions which are independent on the background .",
    "we should notice the following fact .",
    "for any solution , the metric of the world - volume action is determined from the same d - brane background , and it has a singularity at @xmath114 .",
    "so the configuration should be cut at this point , then we can say that the configuration obtained here represents the dyonic string which connects two d - branes with a finite distance .",
    "but these solutions are not the bps states , so some dynamical corrections would modify the configurations obtained here .",
    "this is a dynamical problem , which would be related to the non - supersymmetric yang mills theory .",

    "we have given the solutions of the world - volume action of a d3-brane which is placed parallel to the background d3-brane(s ) .",
    "the equations are firstly solved in the flat background , and two kinds of non - bps solutions are shown , @xmath90 the pure electric and the dyonic solutions .",
    "they smoothly approaches to the bps solutions in a special limit of the parameters .",
    "both the bps and non - bps solutions are also obtained in the d - brane(s ) background .",
    "the bps solutions has the same functional form with the one obtained in the flat background and it can extend to infinity .",
    "but it should be bounded at the position of the opposite brane(s ) since the proper distance in the world - volume of the brane becomes infinite there . as a result , a finite energy of this bps state is obtained .",
    "on the other hand , both types of non - bps solutions are affected by the d - brane background .",
    "especially the electric - type solutions can not arrive at the opposite brane(s ) since they are pushed back by the background configurations . in this sense , this type of non - bps solutions can not be considered as strings which connect two branes .",
    "one of these non - bps solutions can be interpreted as the half - part of the bound state of the brane and anti - brane as in the case of the flat background .",
    "it is observed that the distance between the brane and the anti - brane of this bound state becomes shorter when it nears the background branes .",
    "although the configurations of the dyonic non - bps solutions are also affected by the d - brane background , they could extend over @xmath114 and @xmath88 becomes infinite at @xmath108 . on the other hand ,",
    "the induced - metric of the world - volume action of the d - brane is independent on the solutions , so the configurations of the solutions are bounded at @xmath114 as in the case of the bps solutions",
