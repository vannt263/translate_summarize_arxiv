    "few - body systems provide a useful tool for studying the dynamics of hadronic systems .",
    "the combination of short - ranged interactions and finite density means that the dynamics of complex hadronic systems can be understood by studying the dynamics of few - degree of freedom sub - systems .",
    "few - body systems are simple enough to perform nearly complete high - precision measurements and to perform ab - initio calculations that are exact to within the experimental precision .",
    "this clean connection between theory and experiment has led to an excellent understanding of two - body interactions in low - energy nuclear physics , and a good understanding of the three - body interactions .",
    "our knowledge of low - energy hadronic dynamics is largely due to the interplay between experimental and computational advances .",
    "a complete understanding of even the simplest few - hadron system requires measurements of a complete set of spin observables which have small cross sections and require state of the art detectors . at the same time , the model calculations with realistic interactions are limited by computer speed and memory . in addition",
    "the equations are either singular or have complicated boundary conditions which require specialized numerical treatments .",
    "one of the most interesting energy scales is the one where the natural choice of few - body degrees of freedom changes from nucleons and mesons to sub - nucleon degrees of freedom .",
    "the qcd string tension or nucleon size suggest that the relevant scale for the onset of this transition is about a gev . a consistent dynamics of hadrons or sub - nuclear particles on this scale must be relativistic ; a galilean invariant theory can not simultaneously preserve momentum conservation in the lab and center of momentum frames if the initial and final reaction products have different masses .",
    "relativistic dynamical models are most naturally formulated in momentum space .",
    "this is due to the presence of momentum - dependent wigner and/or melosh rotations as well as square roots that appear in the relationship between energy and momentum .",
    "non - relativistic few - body calculations formulated in configuration space with local potentials have the advantage that the matrices obtained after discretizing the dynamical equations are banded , thus reducing the size of the numerical calculations .",
    "equivalent momentum - space calculations lead to dense matrices of comparable dimensions .",
    "in addition , the embedding of the two - body interactions in the three - body hilbert space leads to non - localities .",
    "realistic relativistic three - body calculations are just beginning to be solved @xcite .",
    "numerical methods that can reduce the size of these calculations could make relativistic calculations of realistic systems more tractable .    in this paper",
    "we explore the use of wavelet basis functions to reduce the size of momentum space scattering calculations .",
    "the resulting linear system can be can be accurately approximated by a linear system with a sparse kernel .",
    "it is our contention that the use of this sparse kernel results in a reduction in the size of the numerical calculation that is comparable to the corresponding configuration space calculations .",
    "the advantage is that the wavelet methods can be applied in momentum space and are not limited to local interactions .",
    "the long - term goal is to apply wavelet methods to solve the relativistic three - body problem . in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we tested this method to solve the non - relativistic lippmann - schwinger equation with a malfliet tjon v potential . in this test problem",
    ", the s - wave k - matrix was computed .",
    "the wavelet method led to a significant reduction in the size of the problem .",
    "we found that 96% of the matrix elements of the kernel of the integral equation could be eliminated leading to an error of only a few parts in a million .",
    "the success of wavelet method in @xcite suggests that the method should be tested on a more complicated problem . in this paper , we test the wavelet method on the same problem without using partial waves .",
    "this leads to a singular two - variable integral equation , which has the same number of continuous variables as the three - body faddeev equations with partial waves .",
    "it is simpler than the full three - body calculation , but is a much larger calculation than was needed in ref .",
    "in addition , computations that employ conventional methods @xcite are available for comparison . in solving this problem",
    "it is necessary to address issues involving the storage and computations with large matrices .",
    "one well known use of wavelets is in the data compression algorithm used in jpeg files @xcite .",
    "our motivation for applying wavelet methods to scattering problems is based on the observation that both a digital photograph and a discretized kernel of an integral equation are two - dimensional arrays of numbers .",
    "if wavelets can reduce the size of a digital image , they should have a similar effect on the size of the kernel of an integral equation .",
    "given the utility of wavelets in digital data processing , it is natural to ask why they have not been used extensively in numerical computations in scattering .",
    "one possible reason is because there is a non - trivial learning curve that must be overcome for a successful application to singular integral equations .",
    "a relevant feature is that the basis functions have a fractal structure ; they are solutions to a linear renormalization group equation and thus have structure on all scales .",
    "numerical techniques that exploit the local smoothness of functions do not work effectively with functions that have structure on all scales .    in @xcite",
    ", we concluded that these limitations could be overcome by exploiting the renormalization group transformation properties of the basis functions in numerical computations .",
    "these equations were used to compute moments of the basis functions with polynomials .",
    "these moments were used to construct efficient quadrature methods for evaluating overlap integrals .",
    "in addition , these moments could be combined with the renormalization group equations to perform accurate calculations of the types of singular integrals that appear in scattering problems .",
    "a key conclusion of @xcite was that wavelet methods provide an accurate and effective method for solving the scattering equations .",
    "in addition , the expected reduction in the size of the numerical problem could be achieved with minimal loss of precision .",
    "there are many kinds of wavelets .",
    "in @xcite we found that the daubechies-3 @xcite wavelets proved to be the most useful for our calculations .",
    "numerical methods based on wavelets utilize the existence of two orthogonal bases for a model space .",
    "the two bases are related by an orthogonal transformation . the first basis , called the father function basis , samples the data by averaging on small scales .",
    "it is the numerical equivalent of a raw digital photograph .",
    "the orthogonal transformation is generated by filtering the coefficients of the father function basis into equal numbers of high and low frequency parts .",
    "the high frequency parts are associated with another type of basis function known as the mother function .",
    "the same filter is again applied only to the to the remaining low frequency parts , which are divided into high and low frequency parts .",
    "this is repeated until there is only one low frequency coefficient .",
    "this orthogonal transformation and its inverse can be generated with the same type of efficiency as a fast fourier transform .",
    "the new basis is called the wavelet basis .    for the daubechies-3 wavelets ,",
    "both sets of basis functions have compact support .",
    "the support of the father function basis functions is small and is determined by the resolution of the model space .",
    "the support of the wavelet basis functions is compact , but occurs on all scales between the finest resolution and the coarsest resolution .",
    "the father function for the daubechies-3 wavelets has the property that a finite linear combination of such functions can locally pointwise represent a polynomial of degree two or less .",
    "integrals over these polynomials and the scaling basis functions can be done exactly and efficiently using a one - point quadrature .",
    "the mother functions have the property that they are orthogonal to polynomials of degree two .",
    "this means that the expansion coefficient for a given mother basis function is zero if the function can be well - approximated by a polynomial on the support of the basis function .",
    "it is for this reason that most of the kernel matrix elements in this representation are small .",
    "setting these small coefficients to zero is the key approximation that leads to sparse matrices .",
    "some of the properties that make the daubechies wavelets interesting for numerical computations are    * the basis functions have compact support .",
    "* the basis functions are orthonormal .",
    "* the basis functions can pointwise represent low degree polynomials * the wavelet transform automatically identifies the important basis functions .",
    "* there is a simple one point quadrature rule that is exact for low - degree local polynomials .",
    "* these are accurate methods for computing the singular integrals of scattering theory .",
    "* the basis functions never have to be computed .",
    "the above list indicates that wavelet bases have many advantages in common with spline bases , which have proven to be very useful in large few - body calculations .",
    "both the spline and wavelet basis functions have compact support , which allows them to efficiently model local structures , both provide pointwise representations of low - degree polynomials , both can be easily integrated using simple quadrature rules , and both can be accurately integrated over the scattering singularity .",
    "one feature that distinguishes the wavelet method from the spline method is that the wavelet transform automatically identifies the important basis functions that need to be retained . with splines ,",
    "the regions that have a lot of structure and require extra splines need to be identified by hand .",
    "this is a non - trivial problem in large calculations .",
    "the automatic nature of this step is an important advantage of the wavelet method in large calculations .",
    "in addition , unlike the spline basis functions , the wavelet basis functions are orthogonal , and the one - point quadrature only requires the evaluation of the driving term or kernel at a single point to compute matrix elements .",
    "this leads to numerical approximations that combine the efficiency of the collocation method with the stability of the galerkin method .    in the next section",
    "we give an overview of the properties of wavelets that are used in our numerical computations .",
    "our model problem is defined in section three .",
    "the methods of section two are used in section four to reduce the scattering integral equation in section three to an approximate linear system .",
    "the transformation to a sparse - matrix linear system and the methods used to solve the linear equations are discussed in section five .",
    "the considerations discussed in this section are important for realistic applications .",
    "the results of the model calculations are discussed and compared to the results of partial - wave calculations in section six .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section seven .",
    "the complex biconjugate gradient algorithm that was used to solve the resulting system of linear equations is outlined in the appendix .",
    "in our work , we use daubechies original bases of compactly supported wavelets @xcite .",
    "in addition to their simplicity , these functions possess many useful properties for numeric calculations , which are discussed at the end of this section .",
    "there are two primal basis functions called the father , @xmath0 , and mother , @xmath1 .",
    "the primal father function is defined as the solution of the homogeneous scaling equation    @xmath2    with normalization @xmath3 the primal mother function is defined in terms of the father by a similar scaling equation , @xmath4 where @xmath5 the parameter @xmath6 is the order of the daubechies wavelet and the @xmath7 are a unique set of numerical coefficients that satisfy certain relations @xcite such as orthogonality of basis functions .",
    "we employ wavelets of order @xmath8 , henceforth called daubechies-3 wavelets .",
    "the numerical values of the @xmath7 are given in table [ coef ] .",
    "equation ( [ scale ] ) is the most important in all of wavelet analysis , as all the properties of a wavelet basis are determined by the so - called filter coefficients , @xmath7 .",
    "a simple property that follows from the @xmath7 is that the father and mother function both have compact support on the interval @xmath9 .",
    "all other basis functions are related to the primal father and mother by means of dyadic ( power of two ) scale transformations and unit translations ,    .scaling coefficients for daubechies-3 wavelets [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     [ shifts ]",
    "we have shown that it is possible to use wavelets to calculate the two - body scattering matrix in terms of momentum vectors without resorting to partial waves .",
    "we were able to accurately reproduce the phase shifts of the malfliet - tjon potential .",
    "these calculations lead to sparse matrices , which can be efficiently inverted using standard iterative methods .",
    "application of a simple preconditioning matrix was shown to be necessary to achieve convergence of the iterative methods .",
    "traditional methods for solving scattering equations in momentum space typically produce dense matrices that require a large amount of storage and are time consuming to invert .",
    "these are promising results because relativistic scattering equations are naturally formulated in momentum space .",
    "also , the scattering boundary conditions are most easily treated in momentum space .",
    "wavelet methods can help treat both of these of problems .",
    "one of the main advantages of wavelet methods over methods such as splines is that the wavelet transform presents a method that automatically determines what basis functions are necessary for a given accuracy .",
    "unfortunately , this also leads to one of the main drawbacks of this method . in our procedure , a large dense matrix , @xmath10 , needs to be produced first and then this is transformed to a sparse matrix .",
    "most of the computational time is spent constructing and transforming this matrix into a sparse format .",
    "the subsequent solution of the sparse linear system takes relatively little computational effort .    for this specific problem",
    ", wavelet methods based on momentum vectors may not be necessary .",
    "the maximum number of partial waves that needs to be included to achieve convergence , @xmath11 @xcite , is simply too small to gain a computational benefit from using wavelets in the angular variable . to achieve a computational benefit",
    "we should use less basis functions in the angular variable than the maximum number of partial waves .",
    "in the three - body problem or at much higher energies , the number of partial waves that need to be included increases considerably and computational benefits may be gained from employing a momentum vector approach .",

    "the biconjugate gradient method @xcite is an iterative technique for solving large matrix equations of the form @xmath12 the advantage of this method for large sparse matrices is that it only involves matrix multiplication by @xmath10 and its adjoint , both of which can be accomplished efficiently in a sparse storage format such as ccs @xcite .",
    "the algorithm generates a sequence of approximate solutions , @xmath13 with residual @xmath14 .",
    "one iterates until the norm of the residual is less than some predetermined value .",
    "this method is traditionally formulated for real matrices , but the extension to complex matrices is straightforward .",
