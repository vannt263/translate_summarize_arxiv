    "some of these patterns also occur in quantum ferrofluids : stripe phases ( density wave modulations ) will be discussed in the quantum case in the absence of vortices in section [ subsubsec : outsidetfregime ] and in the presence of vortices beginning in section [ subsec : structureofvortex ] .",
    "vortex lattices in quantum fluids tend to form hexagonal patterns ( abrikosov lattices ) even in the absence of dipolar interactions where the long - range logarithmic hydrodynamic interaction between vortices plays an important role .",

    "the above patterns can all be captured to some degree by mean - field theory where no attempt is made to describe the fluid at the molecular level .",
    "however , it has long been predicted that with strong dipolar interactions ferrofluid molecules can form chains and rings @xcite . in order to describe such strong correlation effects , which lie beyond the mean - field description , it is necessary to use computationally intensive monte carlo and molecular dynamics techniques @xcite .",
    "these methods suggest a complex and rich phase diagram . in zero",
    "applied field at relatively low temperatures , and as the density is increased from low to high , the molecules initially form rings which unbind into chains which then cluster into networks , which break down into a normal liquid , then form a ferroelectrically ordered liquid , followed by a possible ferroelectric columnar ordering , and finally form a ferroelectric solid . in the presence of an external field chains , columns , sheets , bent walls , lamellar , labyrinthine or worm - like structures , and hexagonal structures all appear @xcite .",
    "transitions from single chains to double chains ( zig - zag ) can also occur if initially strong transverse confinement is reduced @xcite .",

    "one of the main interests in these systems is the formation of so - called supersolids which are both crystalline and yet also have superfluid properties @xcite . unlike the density wave structures we shall study later in this review , which have many atoms per wavelength , in the strongly correlated case",

    "( [ eq : bkt ] ) is regained , i.e. @xmath651 , with the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition arising from the divergence at @xmath639 .",
    "however , the inclusion of the additional power law interaction between the vortex and antivortex , arising from the absence of dipoles in the region of the cores , does not fundamentally change this result . specifically , the mean - square separation , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bkt_dip ] ) , diverges first at @xmath639 , i.e. this simple analysis implies that although the dipolar interaction can change the interaction between vortex - antivortex pairs the long - range hydrodynamic interaction always wins , suggesting that the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition is unaffected by dipolar interactions .",
    "this is consistent with more detailed analysis presented in @xcite which found , at best , a weak dependence of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition on the strength of the dipolar interactions .",
    "for example , working within the xy - model vasiliev _ et al _",
    "@xcite concluded that polarization of the system ( i.e.  the generation of additional vortex - antivortex pairs between any two points ) screens out the long - range interactions .",
    "however , in our opinion there is still room for more work in this area such as considering finite - size effects and the true form of the _ dipolar _ interaction between a vortex - antivortex pair in order to firmly establish the role of dipolar interactions on this phase transition in physical systems .      a supersolid phase is characterised by the spontaneous formation of a periodic structure in a system which also supports superfluidity , i.e.  both on- and off - diagonal long - range order in the single particle density matrix . for",
    "more than half a century considerable effort has been expended theorizing about the possibility of supersolidity in condensed matter systems @xcite . in particular , the investigation of a supersolid phase in @xmath233he @xcite has been the primary focus of the more recent work . however , the most credible claim for the experimental observation of a supersolid phase in @xmath233he @xcite has now been withdrawn @xcite .",
    "the relatively recent realization of dipolar cold atoms and molecules now provides an alternative venue for investigating supersolid phases .",
    "apart from the strongly correlated dipolar systems @xcite cited in section [ sec : clas_ferro ] , extended bose - hubbard lattice models are also thought to support supersolidity @xcite .",
    "the common ingredient in both sets of investigations is the presence of long - range interactions .",
    "there have also been various works focusing on how an artificial gauge field in a dipolar bec influences the boundaries between mott - insulator and supersolid regimes @xcite , and how staggered fluxes lead to supersolid phases with staggered vortex phases @xcite .",
    "however , there does not appear to have been much investigation into the structural properties of vortices @xcite and vortex lattices in the supersolid state .      by studying",
    "a two - dimensional point vortex model onsager predicted that negative temperature states may be relevant for two - dimensional fluids @xcite .",
    "while intended as a model of two - dimensional fluids in general , onsager noted that the model was potentially particularly relevant for two - dimensional superfluids , whose vortices have quantized circulation and uniform size .",
    "simulations of the two - dimensional gpe have shown how it is possible to dynamically evolve to the negative temperature onsager vortex state @xcite . starting with a random configuration of vortices and antivortices one might expect the vortices and antivortices to evaporate from the bec via pairwise annihilation and re - thermalization of the emitted sound , simply resulting in a bec with an increased temperature .",
    "however , simula _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that only some vortices annihilate , and the remaining vortices self - organise into two ordered clusters of like - sign circulation , which represent the onsager vortices .",
    "this outcome was found to be the result of the evaporative heating of quantized vortices via vortex - antivortex pair annihilation , leaving the remaining vortices to re - thermalize to a state with higher energy per vortex .",
    "this process drives the vortex component of the superfluid to ever higher energies , leading to the onsager vortex phase transition .",
    "the final onsager vortex state emerges as a clustering of vortices and antivortices .",
    "the dynamical process which leads to this final state is non - trivial , but is underpinned by the interaction between the constituent vortices and antivortices in the system .",
    "introducing dipolar interactions , as shown in section [ sec : dynamics ] , can significantly modify this interaction and as such may result in significant changes to the onsager vortex phase transition .",
    "as such we suspect that dipolar interactions may offer the opportunity to significantly modify the onsager vortex phase transition .",

    "<S> the experimental realization of quantum - degenerate bose gases made of atoms with sizeable magnetic dipole moments has created a new type of fluid , known as a quantum ferrofluid , which combines the extraordinary properties of superfluidity and ferrofluidity . </S>",
    "<S> a hallmark of superfluids is that they are constrained to rotate through vortices with quantized circulation . in quantum ferrofluids the long - range dipolar interactions </S>",
    "<S> add new ingredients by inducing magnetostriction and instabilities , and also affect the structural properties of vortices and vortex lattices . </S>",
    "<S> here we give a review of the theory of vortices in dipolar bose - einstein condensates , exploring the interplay of magnetism with vorticity and contrasting this with the established behaviour in non - dipolar condensates . </S>",
    "<S> we cover single vortex solutions , including structure , energy and stability , vortex pairs , including interactions and dynamics , and also vortex lattices . </S>",
    "<S> our discussion is founded on the mean - field theory provided by the dipolar gross - pitaevskii equation , ranging from analytic treatments based on the thomas - fermi ( hydrodynamic ) and variational approaches to full numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> routes for generating vortices in dipolar condensates are discussed , with particular attention paid to rotating condensates , where surface instabilities drive the nucleation of vortices , and lead to the emergence of rich and varied vortex lattice structures . </S>",
    "<S> we also present an outlook , including potential extensions to degenerate fermi gases , quantum hall physics , toroidal systems and the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition . </S>"
