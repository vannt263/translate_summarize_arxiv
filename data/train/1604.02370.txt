    "asset - exchange models are agent - based models of economies with binary transactions , first proposed by angle  @xcite .",
    "the application of kinetic theory to such models was first undertaken by ispolatov , krapivsky and redner  @xcite , who derived a boltzmann equation for the agent density function of one such model .",
    "the yard - sale model ( ysm ) of asset exchange is a particular asset - exchange model , proposed by chakraborti in 2002  @xcite , and described in some detail by hayes  @xcite later that same year . in the basic ysm ,",
    "each of @xmath0 agents has a single positive scalar attribute , which we call wealth @xmath1 . in each transaction , a certain amount of wealth is moved from one transacting agent to another .",
    "the amount of wealth moved is proportional to the wealth of the poorer of the two agents , with proportionality constant @xmath2 .",
    "the direction in which it is moved is decided by the flip of a fair coin . a boltzmann equation for the ysm was first given by boghosian  @xcite in 2014 .    in the limit of small @xmath2 , known as the _ small - transaction limit _ , it was also demonstrated  @xcite that the boltzmann equation for the ysm reduces to a nonlinear , integrodifferential fokker - planck equation . in 2015 ,",
    "boghosian , johnson and marcq  @xcite showed that the gini coefficient is a lyapunov functional of both the boltzmann and fokker - planck equations , and hence that the basic ysm concentrates wealth from any initial condition .",
    "because the complete concentration of wealth is unrealistic , some attention has been given to modifying the ysm to account for ( i ) redistribution , and ( ii ) bias of the coin based on the relative wealth of the transacting agents .",
    "a simple ornstein - uhlenbeck model  @xcite of redistribution was introduced in  @xcite , and studied in much greater detail by boghosian , devitt - lee , johnson , marcq and wang  @xcite in 2015 .",
    "the redistribution mechanism can be thought of as a tax @xmath3 levied on all agents on a per - transaction basis , pooled and redistributed uniformly to all @xmath0 agents .",
    "this stabilizes the distribution , resulting in a steady state that shares some features with the famous pareto distribution  @xcite , especially in the limit of low @xmath3 . for higher @xmath3 it gives rise to a gibrat distribution  @xcite , albeit with a gaussian cutoff at very large values of wealth .",
    "a constant bias of the coin in favor of the poorer agent was considered by moukarzel  @xcite in 2007 , who showed that it could stabilize the tendency of the model to concentrate wealth , and who demonstrated the existence of a first - order phase transition between a regime of complete wealth concentration and one with a stable steady state as the bias in favor of the poorer agent is increased . because there is substantial evidence that the actual bias in the real world favors the wealthier agent rather than the poorer agent , reference  @xcite also introduced a model of wealth - attained advantage ( waa ) . in this model ,",
    "the coin is biased in favor of the wealthier agent by an amount proportional to the difference in wealth between the richer and poorer agent , times a waa coefficient , @xmath4 .",
    "because the bias is proportional to the wealth difference in this model , it naturally reduces to zero when the transacting agents have equal wealth .",
    "the authors went on to show that this model exhibits a second - order phase transition to a wealth - condensed  @xcite regime when @xmath5 .",
    "specifically , they showed that for @xmath6 , a finite fraction @xmath7 of the population s total wealth `` condenses '' to the wealthiest agent  or , in the continuum limit , to the wealthiest vanishingly small fraction of an agent .",
    "henceforth , we refer to the ysm with both redistribution and waa as the extended yard - sale model ( eysm ) .",
    "the fokker - planck equation for agent density distribution @xmath8 in this model is  @xcite @xmath9}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w } \\left\\{\\zeta\\left[2\\frac{n}{w}\\left(b-\\frac{w^2}{2}a\\right ) + \\left(1 - 2l\\right)w\\right]p\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial w^2}\\left[\\left(b + \\frac{w^2}{2}a\\right)p\\right ] , \\label{eq : fp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have adopted natural `` transactional '' units of time @xmath10 , and defined the _ pareto potentials _ , @xmath11 and where in turn we have defined the total number of agents and the total wealth , @xmath12 respectively",
    ". equation ( [ eq : fp ] ) for the evolution of @xmath13 is a nonlinear , integrodifferential fokker - planck equation .",
    "we note that there are only two free parameters in this equation , namely the redistribution coefficient @xmath3 and the waa coefficient @xmath4 .",
    "if we are interested only in steady - state solutions , we set the time derivative to zero in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp ] ) , and integrate once with respect to @xmath1 to obtain the nonlinear , integrodifferential , _ ordinary _ differential equation @xmath14 = \\left\\{\\tau\\left(\\frac{w}{n}-w\\right)\\right .",

    "\\label{eq : fpss}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] henceforth , we focus on fitting to solutions of this equation , and we ignore the time dependence , writing @xmath15 instead of @xmath8 , etc .    the boundary conditions for eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpss ] ) are described in  @xcite .",
    "we certainly expect @xmath16 from which it immediately follows that @xmath17 from the normalization condition , eq .",
    "( [ eq : n ] ) , and the definition of @xmath18 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : a ] ) , it also follows that @xmath19    at this point , we might wish to add that from the definition of @xmath20 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) , and the definition of @xmath21 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : l ] ) , it also follows that @xmath22 , but for the purposes of finding distributional solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpss ] ) , it is better not to assert this . instead , eqs .  ( [ eq : p0 ] ) through ( [ eq : binf ] ) alone are sufficient to make eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpss ] ) well posed .",
    "then , by either asymptotic analysis of the equation or numerical solutions thereof  @xcite , we find that @xmath23 the question that naturally arises is how eq .",
    "( [ eq : llim ] ) can be consistent with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) and ( [ eq : l ] ) .",
    "the answer is that for @xmath6 , the fraction of wealth @xmath7 `` condenses '' into the hands of a single agent  or , more precisely , a vanishingly small number of agents .",
    "when this `` missing wealth '' is included , the total wealth of the population is @xmath24 .",
    "this is described in much greater detail in  @xcite .",
    "rather than plot @xmath15 versus @xmath1 , we instead plot the fraction of total wealth held by agents with wealth less than @xmath1 , namely @xmath25 , versus the fraction of agents with wealth less than @xmath1 , namely @xmath26 .",
    "this is a parametric plot in the unit square , with parameter @xmath1 , called a _",
    "lorenz curve_. it passes through the origin @xmath27 , since @xmath28 . below criticality , that is for @xmath29",
    ", it passes through the point @xmath30 , since @xmath31 . above criticality , that is for @xmath6",
    ", it passes through @xmath32 instead , because @xmath33 . in between",
    ", it can be proven that it lies on or below the diagonal , is non - decreasing , and is concave up .",
    "( see , e.g. ,  @xcite . )    given @xmath0 and @xmath20 , the distribution @xmath13 can be recovered from the lorenz curve by noting that @xmath34 and @xmath35 . from this",
    "it follows that @xmath36 , which is known as a function of @xmath37 if the lorenz curve is known . this may , in principle , be inverted to obtain @xmath37 as a function of @xmath1 , which may finally be differentiated to obtain @xmath38 .    in the event that all agents have exactly the same wealth , the lorenz curve is the diagonal . in the more realistic situation",
    "for which it lies below the diagonal , twice the area between the actual lorenz curve and the diagonal is called the gini coefficient , @xmath39 .",
    "thus , @xmath40 corresponds to complete economic equality , and @xmath41 corresponds to complete wealth condensation .",
    "it is straightforward to show  @xcite that @xmath42 in what follows , we shall compare the actual lorenz curve of the u.s . in 2013 both without and with the constraint that the gini coefficient match the actual wealth gini coefficient for the u.s . at that time .",
    "the data we used for the u.s .",
    "wealth distribution was taken from the 2013 survey of consumer finances ( scf ) conducted by the federal reserve board in cooperation with the u.s .",
    "department of the treasury  @xcite .",
    "it is a triennial cross - sectional survey of u.s .",
    "families , which includes information on families balance sheets , pensions , income , and demographic characteristics .",
    "household wealth is represented in the scf data by a variable called networth , which is an aggregate of several financial variables .",
    "because networth includes both assets and debts , its value can be negative .",
    "this is a problem for comparisons with predictions of the ysm , which does not allow for negative @xmath1 .",
    "simply shifting all agents wealth upward to make the data positive is not an option , because the agent furthest in debt actually owes billions of dollars . to solve this problem",
    ", we follow the approach of norton and ariely  @xcite who apparently set all observations with negative networth to zero , thereby effectively rendering all debtors bankrupt for the purposes of this analysis .    for reasons of confidentiality , the published scf data  @xcite purposely does not include people listed on the famous `` forbes 400 '' list of the wealthiest people in the u.s .",
    "because this group of people , though small in number , are so wealthy as to have a significant impact on macroeconomic indicators , we felt it important to add them back into the scf data .",
    "fortunately , the journal _ forbes",
    "_ publishes this list of people on an annual basis , including values for their net wealth , so it was a simple matter to modify the scf data to include them .",
    "once this was done , we used eq .",
    "( [ eq : gini ] ) to calculate the wealth gini coefficient of the u.s .",
    "in 2013 , and found that it came to @xmath43 .",
    "because the slope of the lorenz curve ranges from zero to infinity , a simple least - squares fit of the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpss ] ) to the data will be inaccurate .",
    "it is preferable to measure the discrepancy by the sum of the euclidean distances from the solution curve to the data points .",
    "suppose @xmath44 is a lorenz curve resulting from a solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpss ] ) , and @xmath45 the @xmath46th data point , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fitting ] .",
    "suppose further that a perpendicular segment from the data point to the curve intersects it at @xmath47 .",
    "a vector perpendicular to the curve at that point is @xmath48 , so we must have @xmath49 for some @xmath50 . eliminating @xmath50 from this vector equation yields @xmath51 this can be numerically solved for @xmath52 for each data point @xmath45 .",
    "the total discrepancy is then given by @xmath53    because the function @xmath44 describing the lorenz curve of a solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpss ] ) ultimately depends only on @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the values of @xmath52 obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : phii ] ) will also depend on these two parameters , and hence so will the discrepancy given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : j ] ) , which , accordingly , we henceforth denote by @xmath54 .",
    "we minimize @xmath54 in two ways .",
    "first , we search for its local minimum with respect to @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "second , we employ eq .",
    "( [ eq : gini ] ) as a constraint , demanding that @xmath39 of the fit match that of the data exactly .",
    "clearly the first method will yield a lower discrepancy because it does not enforce the constraint .",
    "figure  [ fig : odferror ] displays @xmath54 , plotted against @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "its minimum , marked with a red dot , was found to occur at @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , close to but not precisely the actual value of @xmath43 .",
    "because @xmath6 at this minimum , we see that some wealth condensation was present in the u.s . in 2013 .",
    "specifically , in the continuum limit , a fraction @xmath58 of u.s .",
    "wealth is in the hands of a `` vanishingly small '' fraction of agents .",
    "figure  [ fig : odflorenzfit ] shows the lorenz curve for the optimal values , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . from the picture , we see that the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpss ] ) matches the actual lorenz curve of the u.s . in 2013",
    "extraordinarily well , suggesting that the eysm captures important macroeconomic features of wealth distributions . the fit is noticeably better at medium and higher values of @xmath37 than it is at lower values of @xmath37 , probably because the ysm assumes positive wealth .",
    "next , we employed eq .",
    "( [ eq : gini ] ) as a constraint , fixing the gini coefficient to be that of the data , namely 0.8428 .",
    "this effectively eliminates a degree of freedom , reducing the two - parameter fit to a one - parameter fit .",
    "we searched along the @xmath59 pairs that yield the required gini coefficient for the pair that minimized @xmath54 .",
    "this is equivalent to finding the local minimum on the gini coefficient level curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : odferror ] .",
    "the result is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : odflorenzfita ] , where the red surface is the constraint that @xmath60 .",
    "figure  [ fig : odflorenzfitb ] shows more clearly how the discrepancy varies along this constraint curve .",
    "we see that , owing to the constraint , we can no longer reach the local minimum of @xmath61 precisely . instead , we find a constrained local minimum at @xmath62 and @xmath63 , still in the coexistence regime , now with a fraction @xmath64 of the wealth in the condensed phase .    finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : odflorenzfitc ] shows the lorenz curve fit for the optimal values , @xmath62 and @xmath65 , subject to the @xmath60 constraint .",
    "the fit is still remarkably good , though not as good as the unconstrained fit .",
    "we can see that , for intermediate values of @xmath37 , the fit curve lies below the true data to compensate the error incurred at lower values of @xmath37 , in order to fix the gini at the demanded value .    in the end , fitting without enforcing the constraint on the gini coefficient may be the more useful of the two approaches .",
    "there is , after all , no reason to take the calculated gini coefficient as a more important measure of the distribution than individual data points .",
    "indeed , this appears to be the case when one compares the middle region of fig .",
    "[ fig : odflorenzfit ] to that of fig .",
    "[ fig : odflorenzfitc ] .",
    "our data analysis and numerical studies demonstrate that the eysm with only two free scalar parameters , @xmath3 representing redistribution and @xmath4 representing waa , is capable of describing the actual wealth distribution of the u.s . with remarkable accuracy . by fitting the two free parameters to the 2013 scf data , we were able to estimate @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the u.s . at that time . because @xmath6 , we concluded that the u.s .",
    "economy was in the coexistence regime at that time  that is , a finite fraction of the wealth of the country was held by a vanishingly small fraction of economic agents .    because we ignored the time dependency , and used only the steady state of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp ] ) , future work might focus on the inclusion of this term . for this purpose ,",
    "a more sophisticated fit would be necessary , involving time as an independent variable , and using scf data from prior years .",
    "this work also indicates the most serious deficiency of the eysm ",
    "namely , its inability to model the effect of agents with negative wealth .",
    "it is likely that this explains the inaccuracy of the lorenz curves in both figs .",
    "[ fig : odflorenzfit ] and [ fig : odflorenzfitc ] at low values of @xmath37 .",
    "a more accurate explanation of this regime , with the actual negative values of @xmath21 , remains an important theoretical challenge .",
