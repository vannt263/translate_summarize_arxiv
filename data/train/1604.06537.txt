    "the discovery that , according to quantum field theory in its general curved spacetime version , black holes should radiate away their energy @xcite , has had profound impact on both our understanding of the interplay between gravitation and quantum physics teaching us for instance that the laws of black hole mechanics are in fact the laws of thermodynamics when applied to situations involving black holes and in contributing to our realization that there is much that we still need to understand @xcite . regarding the latter we are referring , of course , to what is commonly known as the `` black hole information paradox '' .",
    "there have been many attempts to address this issue on the basis of proposed theories incorporating quantum treatments of gravitation , and it is fair to say that none of those seem to offer truly satisfactory resolution . for",
    "a review see for instance @xcite .",
    "in fact , there is even a controversy as to whether there is or there is not , a paradox or some open issue that needs confronting . in @xcite",
    ", this question has been discussed and clarified .",
    "the basic issue that seems to underlie the various postures in this respect is associated to the view that one takes regarding the nature of the singularity that is generically found deep in the black hole interior .",
    "if one views this singularity as a fundamental boundary of spacetime , there is in fact no paradox whatsoever , as one can say that information either is  registered on \" or else  escapes through \" that boundary . on the other hand ,",
    "if one views , as do most researchers working in the various approaches to quantum gravity , the singularity as something that must be ultimately  cured \" by an appropriate quantum theory of gravitation , in the sense of replacing it by something amenable to treatment by such theories and not as any kind of essential boundary ( for instance the proposal within loop quantum gravity discussed in @xcite ) , one must explain how to reconcile the unitarity of quantum mechanical evolution ( a feature that among other things requires reversibility and thus the preservation of information ) with the thermal nature of the hawking radiation . without any reasonable reconciliation of the divergent conclusions",
    "one would be entitled to describe the situation as a paradox .    in order to explore the most explicit version of the problem it is customary to consider a black hole formed by the gravitational collapse of a large lump of matter ( with mass of the order of , say , a few solar masses ) characterized by a pure quantum mechanical state .",
    "the problem one faces then is to reconcile the purity of the initial state with the thermal nature of the hawking radiation .",
    "the issue has been studied extensively ( see for instance the nice reviews @xcite , or the works @xcite ) as it is considered one of the major challenges of contemporary theoretical physics    the approaches that have been considered in the search for such a reconciliation seem to be relatively limited",
    ". faced with the fundamental assumption ( * ) : _ the validity of quantum field theory in curved space - times , at least , in regions where curvature is far from the planckian regime _ , these approaches essentially represent variations of the following ideas :    \\1 ) somehow , during the  late time \" part of the black hole evaporation , the hawking radiation is not truly thermal , and is in fact highly correlated with the early - time radiation ( which must remain thermal due to ( * ) ) , so that the full state of the radiation field is pure .",
    "\\2 ) the black hole evaporation is not complete , and modifications associated with quantum gravity lead to the formation of a stable remnant .",
    "such a remnant would have to be in a highly entangled state with the emitted radiation so that the full state of the ( radiation field + remnant ) , is pure .",
    "\\3 ) the hawking radiation is thermal all the way until the eventual evaporation of the black hole but the information somehow crosses the region where the singularity would have been found , and that is now described in terms of the quantum gravity theory .",
    "alternative proposals might involve some combinations of the three proposals above .",
    "however it seems clear that , at least one of them should be able to account for the fate of most of the information .",
    "that is , if none of them can account for anything more than a very small fraction thereof , then the three alternatives together will not be able to account for more than a slightly larger fraction of the full information that needs to be recovered , if the process is to be compatible with the unitarity of quantum mechanics .",
    "the fact is that each of these 3 alternatives have serious drawbacks .",
    "\\1 ) this idea , which is generally framed within the context of the so called black hole complementarity proposals @xcite , has been the subject of recent detailed studies which show , based on the so called monogamy of quantum entanglement , that one of the consequences of such entanglement ( even forgetting for the moment the question of how would such correlations be generated ) would be the formation of  firewalls \" @xcite ( or regions of divergent energy momentum of the quantum field ) around the black hole horizon .",
    "\\2 ) here the issue is that one would be postulating the existence of peculiar kinds of objects , the remnants , typically with a mass of few times the planck mass , which must have an enormous number of internal states , essentially as many as those of a large star .",
    "that is because the full state of the ( radiation field + remnant ) must be pure while the reduced density matrix characterizing the radiation field is thermal , and has an energy content of few solar masses .",
    "\\3 ) this alternative seems to be favored by researchers working in loop quantum gravity , and has been considered in some detail in @xcite . here , there are two issues that need to be clarified .",
    "first , one needs to explain precisely how the information crosses the quantum gravity region that replaces the classical singularity , in particular given that in the lqg context , that region seems to be characterized by signature changes in the metric @xcite .",
    "secondly , there seems to an even more problematic aspect of this proposal : the fact that , after the complete evaporation of the black hole , the information missing in the thermal radiation would have to be encoded in the quantum gravity degrees of freedom ( dof ) , which however would have an essentially vanishing associated energy . that is , the quantum gravity dof would have to be entangled with the hawking radiation in such a way that the complete state of the quantum gravity sector plus the quantum matter field sector , would be pure , and yet the energy would be essentially all in the radiated quanta of the field .",
    "we must note that there have been other proposals such as those considered in @xcite but we feel it is fair to say that none of these has gained any kind of universal acceptability within the community interested in the issues , as each faces some difficulties of its own .",
    "we want to explore a possible resolution of the paradox , by assuming that qg would indeed replace the singularity by something else , suitably described in terms of the fundamental dof of such a theory , but that quantum theory would have to be modified along the lines of the proposals put forward to address the  measurement problem \" by treating collapse of the wave function as a physical process , occurring spontaneously and independently of  observers or measuring devices \" , and that the corresponding modification is such , as suggested in @xcite , that essentially all the initial information is actually lost .",
    "the first aspect we must note about the general proposal is that its setting is within the general context of semi - classical gravity .",
    "that is , a scheme where the gravitational degrees of freedom are treated using a classical spacetime metric , while the matter degrees of freedom are treated using the formalism of quantum field theory in curved space - times@xcite .",
    "the first reaction of many people towards this is to cite the paper @xcite which supposedly rules out the viability of semi - classical gravity . here",
    "we must first point out the various caveats raised about such a conclusion in @xcite and note , in particular , that the work in @xcite centered mainly in the consideration of a formulation in which quantum theory did not involve any sort of collapse of the quantum state , a situation that contrasts explicitly with what we will be focusing on .",
    "the other point noted in @xcite is that if one wants to consider semi - classical gravity together with a version of quantum theory involving the collapse of the quantum state , one faces the problem that the semi - classical einstein equation can not hold during a collapse simply because einstein s tensor is by construction divergenceless while the expectation value of the energy momentum tensor would generically have a non - vanishing divergence .",
    "the point is that one can view semi - classical gravity , not as a fundamental theory , but as providing a suitably approximated description in limited circumstances , something akin to say the hydrodynamical description of a fluid which , as we know , corresponds only to the description of something that at a deeper level needs to be described in terms of molecules moving and interacting among themselves in rather complex ways . following the analogy",
    ", we view the metric description of gravity and the characterization of the matter sector using quantum field theory ( and connected to gravity via einstein s semi - classical equations ) just as an approximated description of limited validity .",
    "in fact this is a point of view that has been explored in the cosmological setting to deal with certain difficulties that arise in the inflationary cosmological account for the emergence of the seeds of cosmic structure @xcite .",
    "the introduction of dynamical collapse within the general framework can be treated in a scheme where one allows an instantaneous violation of the equations , in association with the collapse of the quantum state taking place on a given spatial hypersurface , and in analogy with israel s matching conditions @xcite requiring continuity of the metric across such a hypersurface .",
    "the details of that formalism were first described in @xcite .",
    "we will not discuss these issues further here as they have been thoroughly treated in the above reference and also in the previous works by some of us on the black hole information problem @xcite .",
    "here it is worth pausing to reconsider in more detail certain aspects of the discussion around the issues of energy content .",
    "the setting of the discussion is that of black holes in asymptotically flat space - times . for these space - times",
    "we have a well defined notion of adm mass which is taken as the covariant measure of the energy content of the spacetime , and the quantity that is conserved in the sense that the evaluation of the adm mass gives the same number when computed using any cauchy hypersurface @xmath0 ( which in the extended spacetime ends at @xmath1 ) .",
    "moreover as the spacetime extensions also include the regions @xmath2 and @xmath3 i.e asymptotic future and past null infinity respectively ) one can use the notion of bondi mass associated with any hypersurface @xmath4 ending at a section @xmath5 , ( that is , @xmath4 , together with the segment of @xmath2 starting at @xmath1 and ending at @xmath6 would be a cauchy hypersurface ) .",
    "the point is that the bondi mass at @xmath6 should be equal to the initial adm mass of the spacetime minus the amount of energy that has been radiated to the segment of @xmath2 starting at @xmath1 and ending at @xmath6 .",
    "we must now clarify in what sense are we going to be using the notions of adm mass and bondi mass as being associated with cauchy hypersurfaces @xmath0 and partial cauchy hypersurfaces @xmath4 .",
    "let us concentrate for a moment on the spacetime that lies well to the past of the singularity ( or the would be singularity that presumably is cured by qg ) .",
    "the point is that , although formally the expression for say the adm mass is associated with an  integral at infinity \" the behavior of the metric variables at infinity is conditioned by the energy momentum content associated with the matter fields by the einstein equation . in other words",
    "we can compute the adm mass using the cauchy data for the gravitational sector on @xmath0 , data which are tied to the energy momentum of the matter fields through the hamiltonian and momentum constraints . in",
    "that regard we might want to understand how the various components of the matter field contribute to these constraints in each one of the hypersurfaces in question .",
    "we can say , for instance , that associated with the initial set up , we have a cauchy hypersurface @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ penrose4d ] ) where we have a large lump of matter with a spacetime that is only very mildly curved and characterized by a pure quantum mechanical state of the matter fields , the adm mass is @xmath8 which , as we noted , is of the order of a few @xmath9 . in that case",
    "we would say that the energy of the spacetime , is represented almost completely by that encoded in the energy momentum on the matter fields . at relatively late times , but still at the past of the singularity , we might consider a cauchy hypersurface @xmath10 , that starts at @xmath1 stays close to @xmath2 and finally enters the horizon and ends at the center of the gravitationally collapsed lump of matter which at this stage is well within the black hole horizon . alternatively , we might consider deforming @xmath10 into a hypersurface that ends on the section @xmath11 which we call the hypersurface @xmath12 ( this hypersurface is , of course , not a cauchy hypersurface ) .",
    "if we want now , to account for the energy content in terms of data on @xmath10 , as represented by @xmath13 ( which should be equal to @xmath8 ) , we would have to say that there is a very important component of the energy content , corresponding to the energy momentum tensor of the outgoing hawking radiation , located in the part of @xmath10 which lies on the region exterior to the horizon , while the energy contained in the original lump of matter has been red - shifted by the gravitational potential associated with the black hole , and at the same time there is a negative contribution to the energy content associated with the in - falling counterpart of the hawking radiation , which might be considered as also lying in the proximity of the intersection of the event horizon with @xmath10 .",
    "the situation is depicted , for the realistic 4 dimensional case in figure [ penrose4d ] , and for the 2 dimensional cghs model in [ cghs ] .    in terms of @xmath12",
    "we would say that we need to account for the relatively small value of the bondi mass at its endpoint @xmath11 , a value that is obtained by subtracting from @xmath8 the energy carried away by the hawking radiation that has reached @xmath2 to the past of @xmath6 .",
    "that small value of the bondi mass would , in turn , be accounted for , in terms of the data on @xmath12 , as resulting from the red shifted energy of the original lump of matter , and the negative contribution associated with the in - falling counterpart of the hawking radiation .",
    "we note that the situation on @xmath12 , as far as energy is concerned is very similar to that on any hypersurface characterizing the situation well after the evaporation of the black hole such as @xmath14 in the accompanying figure .",
    "now , we might in a similar way , want to consider the fate of the information in the picture above .",
    "that is we want to consider how is the information , that was present in the quantum state characterizing the initial state of system at @xmath15 , accounted for , in terms of the quantum state characterizing the system on @xmath10 ?",
    "the point is that , by deforming @xmath16 into @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the part of @xmath2 to the past of @xmath6 ) , we can describe the state , as an entangled state , which on @xmath19 is just the hawking thermal radiation , and on @xmath20 is also a highly mixed density matrix , but such that the complete state is pure .",
    "the point that we want to make here is that the above situation seems to be afflicted by the same troublesome aspects which were raised in the context of the alternative 3 ) above .",
    "that is , the state of the system on @xmath20 is one with an enormous number of degrees of freedom and yet a very small value of the energy .",
    "it seems therefore that if we have an explanation for the loss of information in the black hole evaporation that relies on losses associated only with the qg region ( i.e. losses that , in the gr language , would be described as produced by the singularity ) we would still face the uncomfortable aspects that lead to the rejection of alternative 3 ) above , but this time associated with the situation prior to the singularity ( i.e. for instance the situation on @xmath12 ) .",
    "we think that in addressing the problem via the introduction of modifications of quantum theory that last problem is dramatically ameliorated .",
    "the notion that one could learn to live with information being lost in association with the evaporation of black holes , has been considered in some detail in @xcite , where the earlier arguments @xcite indicating that such proposals would necessarily involve large violations of known conservation laws or dramatic violations of causal behavior have been dispelled . in that analysis",
    ", however , the resulting picture seems to be that all the information loss occurs at the singularity , i.e at the region that would be described in non - metric terms in a quantum theory of gravitation , while , in the regions where the metric description would be appropriate , one would have exact quantum mechanical unitary evolution .",
    "our view is that such an approach offers a less unified view of physics than the one we are advancing , and that , as a result , it might be more vulnerable to questions of self consistency .",
    "for instance , if we accept that there are violations to the quantum mechanical unitary evolution , but that those only occur in connection with black hole evaporation , we might have problems , with an ultimate quantum gravity theory , that can be expected to include the possibility of processes involving virtual black holes .",
    "in other words , we might have to face up to the expected result of such a theory indicating that all physical processes must involve contributions from all possible intermediate states according to a path integral formulation of the process , and that those intermediate states would involve also virtual black holes , which in turn would have associated violations of unitarity .",
    "as first discussed in @xcite , this kind of problem seems less likely to arise in a more unified version we are considering , where the violation of unitarity is an integral aspect of the fundamental physical laws as envisaged in the various proposals for modifications of quantum theory that have been made in the context of the search for a resolution of the so called  measurement problem \" @xcite - @xcite .    it is worthwhile reminding the reader that the so called measurement problem in quantum theory is tied to the interpretational difficulties that arise when one does not want to introduce , in the treatment , some artificial classical/ quantum cut ( sometimes presented as a macro/ micro physics cut ) and instead , one wants to consider that everything , including potential observers and measuring apparatuses , should be treated in a quantum mechanical language .",
    "we direct the reader to the works in @xcite for a good overview , to @xcite for a more extensive collection of postures , or to @xcite for a very clear recent analysis .",
    "the relevance of this issue to the problem at hand can be seen from the fact that quantum theory calls for purely unitary evolution only when one is dealing with a completely isolated system in which all degrees of freedom are treated quantum mechanically .",
    "many proposals to deal with the general interpretational difficulties of quantum theory , and in particular with the measurement problem have been considered since the inception of the theory @xcite and there is also a good body of literature devoted to the problems of many of these proposals @xcite .",
    "we want to focus on the dynamical reduction theories which involve a modification of quantum dynamics involving spontaneous reduction of the quantum state .",
    "these kind of proposals are commonly known as  collapse theories \" and have a rather long tradition . for recent reviews",
    "see @xcite .",
    "recently various relativistic versions of spontaneous dynamical collapse theories have been put forward @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we could not end this introduction without acknowledging the strong inspiration that we have drawn from r. penrose s discussions connecting foundational aspects of quantum theory to ideas about the nature of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "in fact in a very early analysis @xcite r. penrose noted that if one wanted to obtain a self - consistent picture of a situation involving thermodynamical equilibrium that included black holes one would need to have a theory of quantum mechanics that incorporated some violation of unitarity in ordinary conditions ( involving no black holes ) .",
    "we view that analysis as providing further support for our approach in contrast to those where violation of unitarity is only associated with the singularity in evaporating black holes .",
    "some of penrose s recent works @xcite on such issues , are also relevant , in a broader sense , to our general views underlying this proposal .",
    "we will present here an concrete version of the above approach based on the theory developed in @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section ii we present a brief description of the cghs 2 dimensional model of black hole formation and evaporation , in section iii we present a relativistic model of dynamical collapse , section iv describes the general setting in which we will put together the two elements previously described , and in section v we will use them to describe the evolution of the quantum state of the mater field thus accounting for the loss of information . in section vi we discuss some subtle points regarding the energetic aspects of the proposal and we end in section vii with the general conclusions indicating what has been achieved and what would need be left as issues for further research .",
    "we have added two appendices for the interested reader convenience : appendix a discusses in detail the foliation independence of the proposal , exhibiting its general covariance , and appendix b presents in some detail the manner in which the delicate issue regarding the expectation of unbounded energy creation is resolved by the introduction of the _ pointer field_.",
    "the two dimensional model , first introduced by callan - giddings - harvey - strominger ( cghs ) @xcite involving black hole formation is a very convenient toy model for the study of issues related to the formation and evaporation of two dimensional black holes .",
    "we now review the basic features of this model . for more details",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",

    "[ cg ] .",
    "it corresponds to a null shell of matter collapsing gravitationally along the world line @xmath27 and leading to the formation of a black hole . for @xmath28 ,",
    "this solution is known as the dilaton vacuum ( region i and i ) .",
    "the metric is found to be @xmath29 which is flat , whereas for @xmath30 the solution is described by the black hole metric ( region ii , iii ) represented by @xmath31 where @xmath32 . here ( null ) kruskal - type coordinates ( @xmath33 ) are useful to describe the global structure of the spacetime . on the other hand , for physical studies involving quantum field theory ( qft ) in curved spacetime , it is convenient to use special coordinates for the various regions . in the dilation vacuum region ,",
    "the natural coordinates are @xmath34 , and thus the metric can be expressed as @xmath35 with @xmath36 .    in the bh exterior ( region",
    "ii ) , a natural set of coordinates is provided by @xmath37 , so that the metric in this region is @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 in order to exhibit the asymptotic flatness , we express the bh metric in schwarzschild - like coordinates ( @xmath41 ) which are defined through the implicit formulas @xmath42 so that we get @xmath43 .",
    "the temporal and spatial kruskal coordinates @xmath44 can be related to schwarzschild - like time @xmath45 and space @xmath46 coordinates , through @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "now we consider the quantum treatment of the matter field @xmath26 .",
    "we will consider the null past asymptotic regions @xmath49 and @xmath50 as the _ in _ region and the black hole ( exterior and interior ) region as the asymptotic _ out _ region .    in the _ in _ region ,",
    "the field operator can be expanded as @xmath51 where @xmath52 , and the basis of functions ( modes ) are : @xmath53 and @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "the superscripts @xmath22 and @xmath56 refer to the right and left moving modes respectively .",
    "these modes define the bases of field quantization and thus the right _ in _ vacuum ( @xmath57 ) and the left _ in _ vacuum ( @xmath58 ) whose tensor product ( @xmath59 ) defines our _ in _ vacuum .",
    "as is well known , one might also proceed to the construction of the field theory in terms of modes that are natural in the _ out _ region by expanding the field operator @xmath60 in terms of the complete set of modes having support both outside ( exterior ) and inside ( interior ) the event horizon . once more we can write the field operator in the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 in the above we have used the convention whereby modes and operators with and without tildes correspond to the regions inside and outside the horizon , respectively .    for the mode functions in the exterior to the horizon we use : @xmath63 and @xmath64 similarly we can choose the set of modes in the black hole interior , ensuring that the basis of modes in the _ out _ region is complete .",
    "the left moving modes are kept the same as before ( since these modes travel from the black hole exterior to the interior ) , while for the right moving mode we take : @xmath65 .",
    "following @xcite , we now replace the above delocalized plane wave modes by a complete orthonormal set of discrete wave packets modes , given by @xmath66 where the integers @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "these wave packets are naturally peaked about @xmath69 with width @xmath70 respectively .",
    "the next step in our analysis is to consider the bogolubov transformations . in our case",
    ", the relevant non - trivial one refers to the right moving sector , and the corresponding transformation from _ in _ to _ exterior _ modes is what accounts for the hawking radiation .",
    "we note that the initial state , corresponding to the vacuum for the right moving modes and the left moving pulse forming the black hole @xmath71 can be written as : @xmath72 where particle states @xmath73 consist of arbitrary but _ finite _ number of particles , @xmath74 is a normalization constant , and the coefficients @xmath75 s are determined using the bogolubov transformations .",
    "their explicit expressions can be seen in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that , if one ignores the degrees of freedom of the quantum field lying in the black hole interior , and describes just the exterior dof of freedom , one ends up ( partially ) describing the state in terms of a density matrix .",
    "that is , one obtains the reduced density matrix by tracing over the interior degrees of freedom ( dof ) , and in this case one ends up , with a density matrix corresponding to a thermal state .",
    "note , at this point this density matrix represents , in the language of @xcite an _ improper _ mixture , as it arises after ignoring part of the system which as a whole is in a pure state .",
    "we will therefore say that what we obtain at this point is an _ improper thermal state_. see discussion in section @xcite for a more exhaustive discussion and analysis of this issue .",
    "it is also discussed in previous works @xcite that the task of accounting for the information loss in black hole evaporation within the approach we are considering requires among other things showing how , as the result of the dynamics , one ends up with a _ proper thermal state _",
    "( i.e. , one that describes an actual mixed state that is not a partial description of a pure state ) starting with an _ initial pure state_.",
    "for the purpose of presenting relativistic collapse models in generality we employ the interaction picture @xcite in which the quantum state of matter @xmath76 is assigned to a space - like hypersurface @xmath77 . as we advance the hypersurface @xmath77 to the future via some arbitrary foliation of spacetime , the state changes according to @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the interaction hamiltonian density .",
    "the functional derivative is defined as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the invariant spacetime volume enclosed by @xmath77 and @xmath82 with @xmath83 ( meaning that no point in @xmath77 is to the future of @xmath82 ) .",
    "covariance requires that @xmath84 = 0 $ ] for spacelike separated @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "this guarantees that advancing of the hypersurface across the points @xmath85 and @xmath86 is independent of the order in which this is done , and more generally it guarantees foliation independence of the state development .",
    "the solution to ( [ tom0 ] ) can be written as @xmath87 satisfies @xmath88}{\\delta\\sigma(x ) } = \\hat{\\cal h}_{\\rm int}(x)\\hat{u}[\\sigma,\\sigma_0],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with initial condition @xmath89 = 1 $ ] .",

    "one can take the view that the resulting state histories with respect to different foliations are merely different descriptions of the same events @xcite .",

    "the covariant form of the collapse dynamics together with the absence of any foliation dependence result in an adequate framework for a relativistic collapse model . to realize such a model we must propose a form for a collapse operator @xmath113 which satisfies the above requirements .",

    "the weyl curvature is zero and so as a substitute we take @xmath148 to be an increasing function of the scalar curvature @xmath22 .",
    "the upshot is that the particular relativistic collapse model determined by the proposal ( [ propose ] ) leads to collapse in the @xmath149 state basis at a rate given by ( [ rate ] ) .",
    "the collapse process will not , however , lead to a precise field eigen - states , simply because the collapse is only assumed to narrow the uncertainty , and the free dynamics of the field , will cause dispersion of the field state in competition with the collapse . in fact , what the result of eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) shows , is that that states with different @xmath150 are distinguished , rather than states with different @xmath26 .",

    "we would be left with states having a relatively well defined value of @xmath151 but possibly different values of @xmath26 .",

    "in fact , a more realistic analysis , where backreaction effects would have to be considered , indicates that energetics will strongly disfavor field configurations with large spatio - temporal fluctuations in the phase .",
    "this follows from the fact such configurations will have a relatively large energy momentum tensor , and thus a large spacetime curvature , and as a consequence , they will be subjected to an increased collapse rate .",
    "the ensuing randomness in the dynamics will only decrease when a configuration with a rather smooth @xmath26 is arrived at .",
    "this is analogous to the effect considered in @xcite .",
    "thus it is natural to expect that ultimately the collapse will be to the @xmath154 basis .    on the other hand , as we will be assuming that the collapse rate increases with curvature in an unbounded fashion , we can expect that collapse effects will accumulate and dominate over any dispersion in the high curvature region near to the black hole singularity , more precisely as the quantum gravity region is approached , and thus we will assume that the collapse process leads to a field eigenstate on hypersurfaces that are close enough to that region as an idealization .    finally , the particular choice @xmath155 can be justified by demonstrating that this reduces to the well established csl model @xcite , @xcite , in the non relativistic limit of a massive complex scalar field of mass @xmath156 ( the non relativistic limit of a real scalar field or a massless field is less obvious ) .",
    "this can be seen from the well know correspondence @xmath157 the collapse basis is then @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the number density of non relativistic particles . up to a spatial smearing function , this is the collapse basis for the csl model .",
    "the smearing is introduced either by spacetime discreteness or the use of an auxiliary field to mediate the collapse process ( see appendix [ ax : aux ] ) .",
    "the situation we want to consider is that corresponding to the formation of a black hole by the gravitational collapse of an initial matter distribution characterized by a pure quantum state @xmath160 describing a relatively localized excitation of the field @xmath161 .",
    "the spacetime is supposed to be described by a manifold @xmath162 with a metric @xmath23 defined on @xmath162 except for a compact set @xmath163 corresponding to the region where a full quantum gravity treatment is required and that is taken to just surround the location of the classical singularity .",
    "this characterizes the formation and evaporation of an essentially schwarzschild black hole , supplemented by the region @xmath163 that is not susceptible to a metric characterization and where a full quantum theory of gravity is needed to provide a suitable description .",
    "we assume that @xmath164 is a compact boundary surrounding the quantum gravity region , which , by assumption , corresponds to that region where otherwise ( i.e , in the absence of a radical modification of gr due to qg effects ) we would have encountered the black hole singularity .",
    "we will further make some relatively mild ( and rather common ) assumptions about quantum gravity .",
    "\\i ) the first assumption , which we have already mentioned , is that qg will cure the singularities of general relativity , however in doing so it will require that there would be regions where the standard metric characterization of spacetime does not apply .",
    "this is what in our case was referred as the set @xmath163",
    "\\ii ) we will assume that quantum gravity does not lead at the effective level to dramatic violations of basic conservation laws such as energy or momentum .",
    "\\iii ) we will assume that the spacetime region that results at the other side of the qg region is a reasonable and rather simple spacetime .",
    "with these assumptions we can already make some simple predictions about the nature of the full spacetime .",
    "given that by assumption the effects of the collapse dynamics will be strong only in the region with high curvature , and more explicitly in the regions where the value of @xmath165 ( @xmath22 in the two dimensional models ) is large , the dynamics characterizing the early evolution of our initial pulse of matter will be essentially the same as that found in the standard accounts of black hole formation and evaporation : the pulse will contract due to its own gravitational pull , and as shown by birkoff s theorem the exterior region will be described by the schwarzschild metric ; the pulse will eventually cross the corresponding schwarzschild radius , and generate a killing horizon for the exterior time - like killing field @xmath166 . the early exterior region and even the region to the interior of the killing horizon but close to it at early times are regions of small curvature and thus the picture based on standard quantum field theory in curved spacetime that leads to hawking radiation will remain unchanged .",
    "this by itself indicates that essentially all the initial adm mass of the spacetime would be radiated in the form of hawking radiation and will reach @xmath167 ( asymptotic null infinity ) .",
    "next let us consider the spacetime that emerges at the other side of the singularity .",
    "given that essentially all the initial energy has been radiated to @xmath167 and in light of assumptions ii ) above the resulting spacetime should correspond to one associated with a vanishing mass ( this would be the bondi mass corresponding to a spacetime hypersurface lying to the future of region @xmath163 and intersecting @xmath167 in a segment to the future of that containing the hawking flux ) .",
    "this conclusion , together with assumption iii ) indicates that this spacetime region should be a simple vacuum spacetime which we take for simplicity to correspond to a flat minkowski region .",
    "let us now focus on the state of the quantum field @xmath168 .",
    "the initial state , as we indicated , corresponds to the _ in _ vacuum except for a pulse of matter falling under its own gravity and leading to the formation of a black hole .",
    "the state can be represented in the first qft construction in section ii as : @xmath169 where the sum is over the sets of occupation number for all modes @xmath170 ( which indicates that the mode @xmath171 is excited by @xmath172 quanta ) , @xmath173 is the total energy of the state according to the notion of energy associated with the asymptotic region , @xmath174 is the hawking thermal coefficient , and @xmath175 is a normalization constant .    at these late times",
    "the excitations associated with the in - falling pulse are all located in the region interior to the killing horizon so that we can write the state ( [ initial state ] ) simply as : @xmath176 where the part in parenthesis corresponds to the black hole interior region and the rest to the exterior .",
    "the point of writing things in this manner is to underscore the fact that both the collapse dynamics and the changes in the state associated with quantum gravity will only affect the modes in the black hole interior region . in the case of the collapse dynamics",
    "this follows from the assumption that the collapse parameter @xmath177 is strongly dependent of curvature and thus its effects will only be relevant in regions of high curvature .",
    "as we have explained , one of the assumptions that underlies the present approach to deal with the information question during the hawking evaporation of the black hole is that the collapse dynamics , although valid everywhere , deviate most strongly from the unitary evolution of standard quantum theory in the regions where curvature becomes large . in the two dimensional context , this is achieved by assuming the that parameter @xmath148 controlling the strength of the modifications is a function of the scalar curvature @xmath22 .",
    "thus the changes to the quantum state of the system result mainly from the nontrivial evolution occurring in the region interior to the black hole horizon , and to the future of the matter shell .",
    "for simplicity we will therefore ignore the modification of the quantum state of the field resulting from the dynamics in the exterior region and the flat region before the matter shell and focus only in the effects of the collapse dynamics in the interior of the black hole lying to the future .",
    "we call this _ the collapse region_.    with these considerations we take the initial state at a hypersurface lying well to the past of the collapse region ( for instance on @xmath15 in fig .",
    "[ cghs ] ) .",
    "this can be expressed in terms of the corresponding density matrix as : @xmath178 we can now simplify things using the basis of eigen - states of collapse operators which we will refer to as _ the collapse basis_. we thus rewrite the above density matrix in the form @xmath179    next we use the fact that , in the collapse region , especially in the late part thereof , the collapse dynamics becomes extremely strong and effective and thus drives the state of the system to one of the eigen - states of the collapse operators .",
    "this allows us to write the state representing an ensemble of systems initially prepared in the same state ( [ initial state ] ) , at any hypersurface @xmath10 lying just before the would - be classical singularity or more precisely the quantum gravity region(see fig .",
    "[ cghs ] ) , after the complete collapse process has taken place as , @xmath180 finally , we need to consider the system as it emerges on the other side of the quantum gravity region , i.e the state describing the ensemble after the would - be classical singularity .",
    "as we have discussed in the introduction we assume that quantum gravity would resolve the singularity and lead on the other side of it , to some reasonable spacetime and state of the quantum fields .",
    "we now consider the characterization of the system on a hypersurface lying just to the future of the would - be classical singularity .",
    "such a hypersurface would not be a cauchy hupersurface as it would intersect @xmath2 rather than @xmath1 .",
    "as such one can partially characterize the state of fields on it by the value of the bondi mass .",
    "it is clear , as have argued in the the introduction , that if we assume that quantum gravity does not lead to large violations of energy and momentum conservation laws , the only possible value for this bondi mass would have to be the mass of the initial matter shell minus the energy emitted as hawking radiation , which is present to the past of the singularity on @xmath2 .",
    "this remaining mass will thus have to be very small .",
    "the task for quantum gravity is to turn the internal state , post singularity into a straightforward low energy state . for simplicity",
    "assume that it is the vacuum @xmath181 being chosen by the collapse process .",
    "this means that the final state characterizing the ensemble of systems ( on @xmath104 ) should be of the form : @xmath182 that is , the system has evolved from an initially pure state to state representing the proper thermal state of radiation on the early part of @xmath2 and the vacuum state afterwards .",
    "one of the most serious challenges one faces when attempting to construct relativistic models of spontaneous dynamical reduction of the wave function , either of the discrete or continuous kind , is their intrinsic tendency to predict the violation of energy conservation by infinite amounts : the problem is resolved in the non - relativistic setting where one can easily control the magnitude of that kind of effect , by relying on suitable spatial smearings of the collapse operators , usually taken to be the position operators for the individual particles that make up the system .",
    "when passing to a relativistic context the tendency is for energy violation to become unbounded unless special care is used in the construction of the theory to ensure it does not .",
    "this issue becomes relevant in the present context at two places .",
    "first and foremost at the point where one wants to consider the back reaction of the spacetime metric to the changes in the quantum state of the field @xmath183 induced by the collapse dynamics",
    ". the second place where the issue appears is the point where one considers the role of the quantum gravity region . in a previous treatment",
    "the argument was that , provided that quantum gravity did not result in large violations of energy conservation one can expect the state after the quantum gravity region to correspond energetically to the content of the region just before the would be singularity , and that this region would have almost vanishing energy content being made up of the positive energy contribution of the collapsing matter shell and the negative energy contribution of the in - falling counterpart to the hawking flux .",
    "we would face a serious problem with this argument if the region just before the would - be singularity could contain an arbitrarily large amount of energy as a result of the unboundedness of the violation of energy conservation brought about by the collapse dynamics .",
    "in that case we would not be able to reasonably argue for the step ( [ post - singularity - vacuum ] ) .",
    "there are various schemes whereby this issue can be tackled :    \\1 ) we might consider a fundamental discreteness of spacetime ( which however as discussed in@xcite should not be tied to violations of special relativity ) .",
    "\\2 ) we might adjust the choice of collapse operators and provide a sensible spacetime smearing scheme for them that relies on the energy momentum of the matter fields or on the geometric structure of the curved spacetime . in this context",
    "is it worth noting that when one considers that the parameter controlling the strength or intrinsic rate of the collapse dynamics depends on the spatial curvature ( i.e. the ricci scalar @xmath184 in 2 dimensions and something like the weyl tensor , through @xmath185 , in the more realistic 4 dimensional case ) one might assume that in flat space - times the collapse rate actually vanishes removing most concerns about the stability of the vacuum in these theories . in that case one would adopt the position that the collapse associated with individual particles in the non - relativistic quantum mechanical context is actually derived from the small deformation of flat spacetime associated to that same particle .",
    "that is , one would consider that the particle s energy momentum curves the spacetime and this in turn turns - on the quantum collapse dynamics .",
    "this is only a rough idea at this point but one that certainly seems worthy of further exploration .",
    "\\3 ) we might rely on the effective smearing provided by the use of the auxiliary pointer field as a way to introduce the smearing procedure without seriously affecting the simplicity of the treatment as discussed in the appendix [ ax : aux ] below .",
    "we have studied the possibility of accounting for the information loss in the processes of formation and hawking evaporation of a black hole through the explicit use of a relativistic version of a dynamical reduction theory . in previous works",
    "it has been argued that the consideration of theories involving departure from the standard schrdinger unitary dynamics offers a promising path to dealing with what many researchers in the community considered as one of the most challenging paradoxes of modern theoretical physics .",
    "those works were carried out using a non - relativistic version of dynamical reduction theories known as continuous spontaneous localization , and one of the open issues in those treatments was whether similar results could be obtained relying on fully relativistic settings .",
    "the present work provides a positive answer in the form of proof of existence of a relativistic approach that leads essentially to the same results as those of the previous non - relativistic treatments .",
    "however it is clear that we are not yet in the possession of a fully satisfactory scheme .    for",
    "that we need to consider in detail the issues related to energy production and its possible back reaction effects .",
    "furthermore eventually one would like to consider the issue of uniqueness and completeness in the sense of determining the collapse operators valid for a general setting that reduces to the appropriate ones ( i.e smeared particle position operators ) in the non - relativistic situations ( the ones treated by the standard csl or grw theories ) , and finding the dependence of the parameters such as @xmath148 on the spacetime curvature .",
