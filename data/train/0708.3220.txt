    "coordination algorithms for multiple autonomous vehicles and decentralized estimation techniques for handling data coming from distributed sensor networks have attracted large attention in recent years .",
    "this is mainly motivated by that both coordinated control and distributed estimation have applications in many areas , such as coordinated flocking of mobile vehicles",
    "@xcite , cooperative control of unmanned air and underwater vehicles  @xcite , multi - vehicle tracking with limited sensor information @xcite , monitoring very large scale areas with fine resolution and collaborative estimation over wireless sensor networks @xcite .",
    "+ typically , both in coordinated control and in distributed estimation the agents need to communicate data in order to execute a task .",
    "in particular they may need to agree on the value of certain coordination state variables .",
    "one expects that , in order to achieve coordination , the variables shared by the agents , converge to a common value , asymptotically .",
    "the problem of designing controllers that lead to such asymptotic coordination is called _ coordinated consensus _ , see for example  @xcite and references therein .",
    "generalisation to high order consensus  @xcite and nonholonomic agents  @xcite have also been explored .",
    "one of the simplest consensus problems that has been mostly studied consists in starting from systems described by an integrator and in finding a feedback control yielding consensus , namely driving all the states to the same value @xcite .",
    "the information exchange is modeled by a directed graph describing in which pair of agents the data transmission is allowed .",
    "the situation mostly treated in the literature is when each agent has the possibility of communicate its state to the other agents that are positioned inside a neighborhood @xcite and the communication network is time - varying @xcite .",
    "robustness to communication link failure @xcite and the effects of time delays @xcite has been considered recently .",
    "randomly time - varying networks have also been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , a first analysis involving quantized data transmission has been proposed in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the consensus problem from a different perspective .",
    "we are interested to characterize the relationship between the amount of information exchanged by the agents and the achievable control performance .",
    "more precisely we assume that @xmath0 agents are given initial positions in the euclidean space , and move in discrete - time in order to reach the average of their initial positions .",
    "this problem is also called _ average coordinated consensus_. every agent asks several agents their position before taking a decision to modify its own position .",
    "we impose that , in order to limit costs of communication , every agent communicates with only @xmath1 agents ( including itself ) , where @xmath2 .",
    "this means that in the graph describing the communications between agents , the max in - degree is at most @xmath1 . in this paper",
    ", we exhibit a family of strategies for solving this problem based on de bruijn s graphs and we prove that according to a suitable criteria this is the best that one can do .",
    "precisely we compute its performances according two criteria : rate of convergence to the average of their initial positions and an lqr criterion .",
    "we find that a deadbeat strategy is optimal according to the rate of convergence , and nearly optimal according to the lqr criterion . finally , we compare it with an another strategy having limited communication and exhibiting symmetries : the cayley strategies @xcite .",
    "it should be noted however that our strategy is limited to the case where the number of agents is an exact power of @xmath1 . whether it is possible to build a linear time - invariant deadbeat strategy for any number of agents ( for a given @xmath1 ) remains an open problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we provide some basic notions of graph theory and some notational conventions . in section iii",
    "we formally define the average consensus problem . in section",
    "iv we introduce the block kronecker strategy . in section",
    "v we show that the block kronecker strategy is the quickest possible strategy and we compare it with the cayley strategy . in section vi we evaluate the performance of the block kronecker strategy according to suitable quadratic criteria .",
    "finally we gather our conclusions in section vii .",
    "before defining the problem we want to solve , we summarize some notions on graph theory that will be useful throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "let @xmath3 be a directed _ graph _ where @xmath4 is the set of _ vertices _ and @xmath5 is the set of _ arcs _ or",

    "a directed graph is said to be _ strongly connected _ if , given any pair of vertices @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath8 is connected to @xmath9 . + finally some notational conventions .",
    "let @xmath10 any matrix belonging to @xmath24 .",
    "with @xmath25 we denote the trace of @xmath10 , i.e. the sum of the diagonal entries .",
    "we say that @xmath10 is nonnegative , denoted @xmath26 , or positive , denoted @xmath27 , if the entries of @xmath10 are respectively nonnegative or positive .",
    "we suppose that the positions of all @xmath0 agents are listed into one vector of dimension @xmath0 .",
    "if the agents move , say , in @xmath28 , it seems that we would need a @xmath29-dimensional vector .",
    "however we will suppose that the positions are scalar , as every linear strategy on scalar positions , if applied separately on every component of the position , trivially extends to strategies for higher dimensions .",
    "more precisely the problem of our interest can be formalized in the following way .",
    "consider @xmath30 identical systems whose dynamics are described by the following discrete time state equations @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the state of the @xmath8-th system , @xmath33 represents the updated state and @xmath34 is the control input .",
    "more compactly we can write @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "the goal is to design a feedback control law @xmath37 yielding the average consensus , namely a control such that all the @xmath38 s become asymptotically equal to the average of the initial condition . more precisely , our objective is to obtain @xmath39 such that , for any initial condition @xmath40 , the closed loop system @xmath41 yields @xmath42 where @xmath43^t$ ] and @xmath44    writing @xmath45 as a linear combination of the eigenvectors of @xmath46 , it is almost immediate to see that the average consensus problem is solved if and only if the following three conditions hold :    * every row and every column of @xmath46 sums to one .",
    "hence it has eigenvalue @xmath47 with @xmath48 as left and right eigenvector .",
    "* the eigenvalue @xmath47 of @xmath46 has algebraic multiplicity one ( namely it is a simple root of the characteristic polynomial of @xmath46 ) . *",
    "all the other eigenvalues are strictly inside the unit circle .    for nonnegative matrices , namely for matrices having all the components nonnegative , condition ( a )",
    "is called double stochasticity , condition ( b ) is ergodicity and condition ( c ) is a consequence of double stochasticity .",
    "we do not require our matrices to be nonnegative , even though it will appear that the optimal matrices are .",
    "observe now that the fact that the element in position @xmath49 of the matrix @xmath46 is different from zero , means that the system @xmath8 needs to know exactly the state of the system @xmath9 in order to compute its feedback action .",
    "this implies that the @xmath9-th agent must communicate his state @xmath50 to @xmath8-th agent . in this context a good description of the communication effort required by a specific feedback @xmath39 is given by the directed graph @xmath51 with set of vertices @xmath52 in which there is an arc from @xmath9 to @xmath8 whenever in the feedback matrix @xmath39 the element @xmath53 .",
    "the graph @xmath54 is said to be the _ communication graph _ associated with @xmath39 .",
    "conversely , given any directed graph @xmath18 with set of vertices @xmath52 , a feedback @xmath39 is said to be _ compatible _ with @xmath18 if @xmath51 is a subgraph of @xmath18 ( we will use the notation @xmath55 ) .    in the sequel , we will impose the following constraint on the communication graph : the max in - degree of the nodes is @xmath1 .",
    "this models the fact that communication lines are costly to establish or operate , and every agent has the right to talk to a limited number of other agents .",
    "note that for compatibility with usual conventions we consider that @xmath1 counts all arcs entering a node , including self - loops ( which could be considered as ` free communication ' in most technological situations ) .    without this constraint ,",
    "the problem becomes trivial : choose the complete graph , and the consensus is reached in one step .",
    "we therefore add the following constraint on @xmath46 :    * every row of @xmath46 contains at most @xmath1 non - zero elements .",
    "from this point of view we would like to obtain a matrix @xmath46 satisfying ( a),(b),(c),(d ) and minimizing a suitable performance index .",
    "the simplest control performance index is the exponential rate of convergence to the average consensus .",
    "when we are dealing with average consensus controllers it is meaningful to consider the displacement from the average of the initial condition @xmath56 it is immediate to check that , @xmath57 ( since the average position @xmath58 is the same at all times @xmath59 ) and that it satisfies the closed loop equation @xmath60 notice moreover that the initial conditions @xmath61 are such that @xmath62 hence the asymptotic behavior of our consensus problem can equivalently be studied by looking at the evolution   on the hyperplane characterized by the condition  .",
    "the speed of convergence toward the average of the initial condition can be defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath63 any matrix satisfying conditions ( a),(b),(c ) .",
    "define @xmath64 which is called the _ essential spectral radius _ of @xmath63 . as the dominant eigenvalues of @xmath65",
    "is one and the others are smaller in magnitude than @xmath66 , the essential spectral radius says how quickly @xmath65 converges to the rank - one matrix @xmath67 , where @xmath0 is the dimension of @xmath63 . in this context",
    "the index @xmath68 seems quite appropriate for analyzing how performance is related to the communication effort associated with a graph .",
    "the smaller the essential spectral radius , the quicker the system will converge to the average of the initial condition .",
    "however in control theory , strategies that converge in finite time or very quickly are sometimes dismissed on the ground that they lead to large values of update values @xmath69 , that can be physically impossible or very costly to implement .",
    "hence a strategy is often required to optimize an _ lqr cost _ , taking into account both the quickness convergence and the norm of updates values .",
    "therefore another suitable measure of performance could be the following quantity :    latexmath:[\\[\\label{cost } j=\\mathbb{e}(\\sum_{t \\geq 0 } ||x(t)-x(\\infty)||^2 + \\gamma     where @xmath45 is the vector of positions at time @xmath59 , @xmath71 is the vector whose every entry is the average of initial positions , @xmath69 is the update vector at time @xmath59 , the initial positions are supposed to be uncorrelated random variables with unit variance , @xmath72 denotes the expectation , @xmath73 is the euclidean norm and @xmath74 is a nonnegative real .",
    "we will prove that the optimal topology of communication ( in the meaning of speed of convergence ) is given by a de brujin s graph .",
    "we will call the control strategies based on such graph block kronecker strategies , as explained in the next section . for these strategies",
    "we will evaluated ( [ cost ] ) and we will compare them to another family of strategies based on a regular communication graph having the same degree @xmath1 : the cayley strategies  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we define block kronecker strategies . let @xmath10 be a @xmath75 matrix satisfying ( a),(b),(c),(d ) and @xmath17 be a nonnegative integer . note that if @xmath10 is full then @xmath76 ( since the number of non - zero elements can not exceed @xmath1 ) .",
    "then we build an @xmath77 matrix @xmath78 in the following way .",
    "let @xmath79\\ ] ] be a row - partition of the matrix @xmath10 , where @xmath80 .",
    "then @xmath78 is the matrix @xmath81.\\ ] ] for example , if @xmath82 ( with @xmath83 ) and @xmath84 , then @xmath85    this is a kind of block kronecker product .",
    "a general theory of block kronecker product is built in @xcite .",
    "we only need a more restricted definition , detailed below .",
    "the new matrix @xmath78 is a matrix of larger dimension than @xmath10 and satisfying conditions ( a),(b),(c),(d ) : ( a ) and ( d ) follow from the definition , while ( b ) and ( c ) are proved below . hence it can play the role of the matrix @xmath46 in section [ section3].we start by some reminders on kronecker product , define the block kronecker product and explore the properties of the latter .",
    "we recall that the _ kronecker product _ @xmath86 of the matrices @xmath10 and @xmath87 is the matrix @xmath88_{i , j}$ ] , whose dimensions are the product of dimensions of @xmath10 and @xmath87",
    ". some useful properties of the kronecker product are the following :    * @xmath89 ; * @xmath90 ; * the eigenvalues of @xmath91 are all possible products of an eigenvalue of @xmath10 with an eigenvalue of @xmath87 ; * the eigenvectors of @xmath91 are all possible kronecker products of an eigenvector of @xmath10 with an eigenvector of @xmath87",
    ".    the kronecker product is sometimes called tensor product .",
    "let us see why .",
    "for instance consider the matrices @xmath92 of sizes @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "the kronecker product has size @xmath96 , and an arbitrary element of @xmath97 can be denoted @xmath98 , where the index written as @xmath99 denotes the number @xmath100 and the index @xmath101 is the number @xmath102 ; we suppose that the indices start form zero : @xmath103 , etc .",
    "if @xmath92 happen to be square matrices of size @xmath104 , this notation coincides with the usual notation in base @xmath104 of an index running from @xmath105 to @xmath106 .",
    "this notation of the kronecker product is very close to the tensor product used in algebra and differential geometry .",
    "the only difference is that @xmath97 , viewed as a tensor product , is considered as a @xmath107-dimensional array with @xmath108 as separate indices , instead of a matrix ( i.e. , a @xmath109-dimensional array ) .",
    "all this immediately extends to more than three matrices .",
    "let us now consider the following variant of kronecker product , that we call _ block kronecker product_. consider for instance two matrices @xmath87 ( of size @xmath110 ) and @xmath111 ( of size @xmath112 ) .",
    "the block kronecker product of @xmath87 and @xmath111 is defined as follows : its element of index @xmath113 is the element @xmath114 ( notice the shift of the first indices by two places ) .",
    "we will denote this matrix by @xmath115 .",
    "this definition applies to any two square matrices whose dimensions are powers of @xmath104 . in general ,",
    "we can write @xmath116 , where @xmath117 operates a cyclic permutation by one place to the left on the digits of @xmath118 in base @xmath104 , and @xmath111 is of size @xmath119 .    the matrix @xmath78 defined by equation ( [ eq : m ] ) can be expressed as @xmath120 ( where the @xmath75 identity matrix @xmath121 is repeated @xmath122 times ) . if we write the index of @xmath78 in base @xmath104 , then @xmath123 .",
    "this form is particularly useful to compute the behavior of @xmath78 from the properties of the block kronecker product , which we now explore . as a first property",
    ", we can easily see that @xmath124 we can also prove the following lemma .    for any matrices @xmath125 for which all the products below are meaningful",
    ", we have @xmath126    we write , using einstein s convention ( indices repeated twice in an expression are implicitly summed over ) , @xmath127_{u , w}=\\\\ & = ( ( a \\otimes b ) \\odot c)_{u , v } ( ( d \\otimes e ) \\odot f)_{v , w}\\\\ & = a_{u_2,v_1 } b_{u_3,v_2 } c_{u_1,v_3 } d_{v_2,w_1 } e_{v_3,w_2 } f_{v_1,w_3},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 , interpreted as sequences of digits in base @xmath104 , have been partitioned into @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 in an appropriate way .",
    "this is possible if @xmath87 and @xmath134 have same size , as well as @xmath111 and @xmath135 , and @xmath10 and @xmath136 .",
    "then the expression above can be regrouped as @xmath137 which ends the proof .    in particular ,",
    "if @xmath138 we have @xmath139 if we choose @xmath140 instead , we have @xmath141    the following proposition provides an interesting characterization of the powers of any order of the matrix @xmath78 .",
    "[ prop1 ] for @xmath10 a square matrix , @xmath78 defined by equation ( [ eq : m ] ) , and any integers @xmath142 and @xmath143 , @xmath144 where the exponents in the right - hand side sum to @xmath145 .",
    "we prove the claim by induction on @xmath145 .",
    "it is true by definition for @xmath146 .",
    "the induction step is easily proved by applying equation ( [ lemm11 ] ) . indeed , @xmath147[((i",
    "\\otimes \\cdots \\otimes",

    "the argument is correct also for limit cases @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "in particular we have the following .    [ coro ] for @xmath10 a square matrix and @xmath78 defined by equation ( [ eq : m ] ) , @xmath151 moreover , if @xmath10 satisfies ( a),(b),(c ) the essential spectral radius of @xmath78 is the @xmath17th root of the essential spectral radius of @xmath10 .",
    "the first part is a particular case of proposition [ prop1 ] . from the properties of kronecker product ,",
    "we know the spectrum of @xmath152 is composed of all possible products of @xmath17 eigenvalues of @xmath10 .",
    "hence the largest eigenvalue in absolute value , different from @xmath47 , of the matrix @xmath152 results to be @xmath153 , where @xmath154 denotes the largest eigenvalue in absolute value , different from @xmath47 , of the matrix @xmath10 .",
    "this also proves also that conditions ( b ) and ( c ) are verified for @xmath78 when they are for @xmath10 .",
    "if we take @xmath155 of size @xmath104 , then @xmath152 is the matrix @xmath156 of size @xmath157 with all identical elements .",

    "moreover , it is easy to see that for any cayley matrix @xmath63 we have that @xmath215 if and only if @xmath216 .",
    "this implies that a cayley stochastic matrix is automatically doubly stochastic . in this case",
    "the function @xmath212 associated with the matrix @xmath63 is a probability distribution on the group @xmath200 . among the multiple possible choices of the probability distribution @xmath212 ,",
    "one is particularly simple , namely @xmath217 for every @xmath218 .",
    "[ ex : weighted_cayley_graph ] let us consider the group @xmath219 of integers modulo @xmath0 and the cayley graph @xmath220 where @xmath221 .",
    "notice that in this case @xmath203 is inverse - closed .",
    "consider the uniform probability distribution @xmath222 the corresponding cayley stochastic matrix is given by @xmath223 notice that in this case we have two symmetries .",
    "the first is that the graph is undirected and the second that the graph is circulant .",
    "these symmetries can be seen in the structure of the transition matrix @xmath63 that , indeed , turns out to be both symmetric and circulant @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the group @xmath224 and the cayley graph @xmath225 where @xmath226 .",
    "again consider the uniform probability distribution @xmath227 the corresponding cayley stochastic matrix is given by the following block circulant matrix belonging to @xmath228 @xmath229 where @xmath230 are such that @xmath231 this example can be generalized to the more general case of the discrete @xmath232-dimensional tori @xmath233 , extensively studied in the literature regarding the peer - to - peer networks @xcite , @xcite .",
    "now we recall an interesting result regarding the essential spectral radius of the cayley stochastic matrices .",
    "assume that @xmath234 is a cayley stochastic matrix generated by a suitable @xmath212 and assume that @xmath235 , where @xmath203 is as previously defined .",
    "moreover assume that @xmath236 .",
    "notice that this last fact implies that @xmath237 then it follows that @xmath238 , where @xmath239 is a constant independent of @xmath203 and @xmath0 the number of agents .",
    "this result was proved in @xcite .    on the other side ,",
    "the block kronecker strategy constructed from any matrix @xmath10 has essential spectral radius @xmath240 , where @xmath241 is the essential spectral radius of @xmath10 , as stated in corollary [ coro ] .    if @xmath242 , then @xmath240 behaves like @xmath243 for large @xmath17 and some @xmath244 . recall that @xmath17 is @xmath245 .",
    "hence this is better than abelian cayley strategies .    in conclusion ,",
    "block kronecker strategies have a better essential spectral radius , hence a quicker convergence speed , than cayley strategies . for the particular choice given by equation ( [ eqnadeadbeat ] ) ,",
    "we converge in finite time , and this time is the smallest possible over all linear strategies with the same constrained degree .      as an illustration",
    ", we present a simulative comparison between the cayley strategy and the block kronecker strategy .",
    "the network considered consists of @xmath246 agents .",
    "the matrix @xmath63 for the cayley strategy is the matrix ( [ p : example1 ] ) , whereas the matrix @xmath78 for the block kronecker strategy is built starting from @xmath247\\ ] ] with @xmath248 and @xmath249 .",
    "the initial conditions has been chosen randomly inside the interval @xmath250 $ ] . in both cases",
    "the in - degree is @xmath251 .",
    "notice that , as depicted in figure [ fig : kron ] , the block kronecker strategy reaches the average of the initial conditions in a finite number of steps whereas , the cayley strategy , after the same numbers of steps , is still far from converging toward the meeting point .",
    "in this section we want to evaluate the performance of the block kronecker strategy according to the quadratic cost @xmath252 , where @xmath253 accounts for the quickness of convergence , @xmath254 limits the norm of the updates , and @xmath255 weights the respective importance of those two factors .",
    "precisely we evaluate @xmath256 for any block kronecker strategy derived from a normal matrix @xmath10 .",
    "remember that the initial state @xmath257 is supposed to be characterized by a identity covariance matrix .",
    "we start with a lemma which provides an upper and a lower bound for @xmath258 .",
    "[ lemm : j1 ] if @xmath10 is a normal @xmath75 matrix satisfying conditions ( a),(b),(c ) , and @xmath259 is the essential spectral radius of @xmath10 , then the @xmath258 cost of the corresponding block kronecker strategy of size @xmath157 satisfies : @xmath260 where @xmath261 and @xmath262    classical arguments lead to write : @xmath263 with @xmath264 .",
    "now , @xmath265 . when @xmath78 is derived by block kronecker product from a normal matrix @xmath10 , this is equal to @xmath266 if @xmath170 , according to proposition [ prop2 ] .",
    "we get a lower bound on @xmath258 by summing only the first @xmath17 terms :    @xmath267    the last summation is a geometric series that can be evaluated , leading to the bound @xmath268 this proves the left inequality in the claim .    for the right inequality , we find an upper bound on the terms neglected in the lower bound ( [ eq : lowboundj1 ] ) . as normal matrices",
    "can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation , the eigenvalues of @xmath269 , which we denote @xmath270 , are precisely the squared module of the eigenvalues of @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , @xmath271 , and the trace of @xmath272 is @xmath273 .",
    "the terms neglected in the lower bound ( [ eq : lowboundj1 ] ) are    @xmath274    for every @xmath275 , we bound every of the @xmath17 terms by the highest ( for which @xmath149 ) . hence the neglected terms are bounded from above by : @xmath276 where @xmath63 is a polynomial in the variables @xmath277 with no independent term : all monomials have degree at least one .",
    "now we can sum all corresponding monomials for @xmath278 : this is a geometric series of progression at most @xmath279 .",
    "hence @xmath280 is at most @xmath281 .",
    "hence @xmath258 differs from our lower bound by at most @xmath282 .",
    ". now we estimate @xmath284 .    under the assumptions of lemma [ lemm : j1 ] ,",

    "this involves terms of the form @xmath288 .",
    "more precisely ,    @xmath289    the first term of the last member is precisely @xmath290 , the last term is , thanks to proposition [ prop3 ] , @xmath291",

    "hence @xmath293 , where , as argued in the proof of lemma [ lemm : j1 ] , @xmath294 .",
    "hence , @xmath295 since the trace of @xmath269 is the sum of squares of elements of @xmath10 , we see that the coefficient of @xmath0 ( neglecting the @xmath296 term ) is optimized by the matrix @xmath297 , whatever the value of @xmath74 is . in this case , the lower bound obtained on @xmath258 is exact , since only @xmath17 terms are non - zero .",
    "the optimal cost is then @xmath298 with @xmath299 .",
    "hence there is here no trade - off between @xmath258 and @xmath284 among the family of block kronecker strategies , in contrast with the general lqr theory .",

    "we have shown that they can converge in finite logarithmic time , which is optimal .",
    "we have evaluated the lqr cost of these strategies , proving their quasi - optimality if the cost of update is small and the degree of the graph not too low .",
    "this work can be extended in several directions , including :    * designing strategies valid for any @xmath0 , not only exact powers of @xmath104 ; * tackling the continuous - time case , where no deadbeat strategy can exist ; * estimating the lqr cost for cayley strategies ; * finding strategies that minimize the lqr cost for any cost @xmath74 of the update ;",
