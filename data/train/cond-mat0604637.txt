    "the overdamped stochastic equation is commonly defined as @xcite    @xmath0    the beginning of theoretical studies of such a stochastic process dates back to the celebrated works by einstein @xcite studying the brownian motion of a free particle , which may formally be considered as an overdamped stochastic motion in a parabolic potential where the role of the generalized coordinate is played by the velocity .",
    "a more general study of overdamped stochastic processes was started by smoluchowski @xcite who formulated the equation of motion for the probability density in an arbitrary overdamped system : this equation bears his name nowadays .",
    "the next milestone was the work by kramers @xcite who , in particular , formulated the problem of the noise - induced _ escape _ of an overdamped system from a metastable potential well and derived its quasi - stationary solution : the quasi - stationary escape flux was found in @xcite using a stationary solution of the smoluchowski equation :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the potential barrier ( assumed to be much less than the noise intensity @xmath3 ) and @xmath4 is certain prefactor which depends on @xmath3 weakly in comparison with the exponential ( activation ) factor .",
    "as follows from @xcite , the escape flux becomes quasi - stationary when time greatly exceeds a characteristic value @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a characteristic relaxation time .",
    "there were only a few theoretical works on the escape in overdamped systems on time scales @xmath7 .",
    "one of the most general of such works was the work by shneidman @xcite who solved the non - stationary smoluchowski equation for an arbitrary potential using the method of the laplace integral transformation while assuming that the quasi - equilibrium in the vicinity of the bottom of the well has been formed .",
    "the latter assumption is valid only for times significantly exceeding the relaxation time @xmath6 while , for shorter times , results of @xcite are invalid .    the time scale @xmath8 was covered in the work @xcite by means of the path - integral method @xcite sometimes called also the method of optimal fluctuation @xcite . as a by - product , it was proved in @xcite that the most probable escape path , i.e. the path providing the absolute minimum of _ action _ in the functional space @xmath9 $ ] , is monotonous i.e. @xmath9 $ ] does not possess turning points .    in parallel to the development of the _ escape _ problem on short times , there was an interesting discussion in the 90th @xcite on the _ transition _ problem on short times .",
    "this problem may be of interest in the context of the prehistory probability density @xcite and of some biological problems @xcite .",
    "unlike the case of the escape , both the initial and final points of the transition differ from the stationary points of the noise - free system and , if they lie on one and the same slope of the potential , the transition may possess features distinctly different from those of the escape .",
    "thus , basing on the method of _ optimal fluctuation _",
    "@xcite , the authors of @xcite suggested that , for the short - time transition uphill the slope of the potential barrier , the _ most probable transition path _ ( mptp ) may first relax close to the bottom of the well and only then go to the final point .",
    "they supported their suggestion by analytic calculations for the parabolic approximation of the potential and , seemingly , by the numerical calculations for the exact potential .",
    "however it was shown in @xcite ( also by means of numerical calculations within the optimal fluctuation method ) that the path which first climbes up close to the barrier top and only then relaxes to the final point may provide an exponentially larger activation factor .",
    "thus , just the latter path pretends to be the mptp in such a case .",
    "the further development of this problem was done in @xcite : it demonstrated that the _ extreme _ paths , i.e. paths providing _ local _ minima of action , can possess _ many _ turning points ; @xcite provides the method how to explicitly calculate all possible ( for a given transition time ) extreme paths and demonstrates that , as the transition time increases , the mptp may switch its topology from the monotonous path to the path possessing one turning point , either continuously or jump - wise .",
    "the _ present _ work proves the general theorem stating that the extreme paths possessing more than one turning point can not provide the _ absolute _ minimum of action i.e. the mptp can be only either monotonous or possessing just one turning point .",
    "it should be noted also that , apart from being necessary for a calculation of the activation energy , the mptp may be of interest on its own : e.g. in the problem of the optimal control , the mptp determines the dynamics of the external force which optimally enhances or suppresses a given fluctuational transition @xcite .",
    "in this section , i briefly reproduce basic equations of the method of optimal fluctuation @xcite and those of results @xcite which will be used in the next section for the proof of the theorem .    within the method of optimal fluctuation , the flux is sought in the form    @xmath10    where the prefactor is assumed to depend on @xmath3 much more weakly than the activation ( exponential ) factor while the activation energy @xmath11 is a minimum of the functional @xmath12 , called action ,    @xmath13}s,\\quad\\quad s\\equiv s[x(\\tau)]=\\int_0^td\\tau\\ ; l , \\\\ & & l=\\frac{1}{4 } \\left(\\dot{x}+ \\frac{du}{dx } \\right)^2 , % \\nonumber % \\\\ % & & \\quad\\quad x(0)=x_0 , \\quad\\quad x(t)=x_f .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the necessary condition for a minimum of the functional is the equality of the variation @xmath14 to zero .",
    "the latter is equivalent to the _ euler equation _ ( ee ) :    @xmath15    which , for a lagrangian of the form ( 4 ) , reads as    @xmath16    so , solutions of the ee , called _ extremal paths _ , are trajectories of the auxiliary mechanical system ( 6 ) .",
    "the _ quasi - energy _    @xmath17    is conserved along a solution of the ee , so that one easily derives from ( 7 ) :    @xmath18    it also follows from ( 7 ) that the range of allowed quasi - energies is :    @xmath19 } [ \\left(du / dx \\right)^2/4 ] .\\ ] ]    eq .",
    "( 8) can be integrated in quadratures .",
    "action @xmath12 can be expressed in quadratures too .",
    "for the case of _ escape _ , i.e. when the initial point is the bottom of the well ( @xmath20 ) @xcite , @xmath21 and therefore the motion in @xmath22 with a quasi - energy @xmath23 can not possess turning points .",
    "thus , the most probable escape path @xmath9 $ ] is necessarily monotonous . on the contrary , in case of _ transition _ within one slope of the potential i.e. when both @xmath24 and @xmath25 lie between the bottom of the well @xmath26 and the top of the barrier @xmath27 , the minimum quasi - energy @xmath28 is negative and hence a trajectory of motion in the auxiliary potential @xmath22 may possess a _ negative _ quasi - energy @xmath29 . in the latter case , the trajectory possesses turning points in @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which are the roots of the equation    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the root nearest to @xmath34 among the roots located at the same side of @xmath35 as @xmath34 :    @xmath36    an extremal path for a given @xmath29 may turn in @xmath31 and @xmath30 any number of times .",
    "let us classify extremal paths by their topology , namely by the overall number @xmath37 of turns of @xmath9 $ ] ( i.e. the number of changes of the sign of the velocity ) and by the sign of the initial velocity multiplied by the sign of @xmath38 : we shall use labels like @xmath39  ( in the case of @xmath40 , the @xmath41 $ ] is necessarily @xmath42 ",
    ", so we shall omit the sign in the label in this case ) .",
    "for each topology defined as above , the extremal path is uniquely defined and , moreover , it can be implicitly expressed by means of quadratures @xcite .",
    "the _ full time _ along an extremal of a given topology can be _ explicitly _ expressed via quadratures . to present these expressions in a compact form , it is convenient to introduce three auxiliary `` times '' :    @xmath43\\int_{a}^{b}dq\\ ; z(q , e ) , \\nonumber \\\\ & & z(q , e)\\equiv{\\rm sign}[x_f - x_0]\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4e+(du(q)/dq)^2}}. % \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for different topologies , the dependence of the full time along the extremal path on quasi - energy reads as :    @xmath44    figs .",

    "5(b ) ) . denoting energy of the local minimum as @xmath130 and denoting @xmath129 in the ranges @xmath131 $ ] and @xmath132 $ ] as @xmath133 and @xmath134 respectively , one may present @xmath120 as    @xmath135    the integrand in the first integral in the last right - hand side is negative in the whole range @xmath136 $ ] and therefore the integral is negative too .",
    "as for the second integral , it can be estimated from above in the following way :    @xmath137    ( for the sake of clarity , the notation @xmath138 has been introduced in the middle line in eq .",
    "( 32 ) ; see also fig .",
    "the last right - hand side in ( 32 ) is exactly the same as in the middle line in ( 29 ) so that its further estimate is identical to that in ( 29)-(30 ) . given that the first integral in the last right - hand side in ( 31 ) is negative , the inequality ( 26 ) is satisfied in this case even stronger than in the case of a monotonous function @xmath106 .    finally , let us briefly consider the case of @xmath139 possessing a local maximum ( fig .",
    "5(c ) ) . denoting energies of the local maximum and minimum @xcite as @xmath140 and @xmath141 respectively , and denoting @xmath129 in the ranges @xmath142 $ ] ,",
    "@xmath143 $ ] and @xmath144 $ ] as @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath145 respectively , one may present @xmath120 as    @xmath146 . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the integrand in the first integral in the last right - hand side is negative in the whole range @xmath147 $ ] and therefore the integral is negative too . as for the expression in the brackets",
    ", it can be estimated from above in the following way :    @xmath148 \\nonumber \\\\ & & < -e_a^{(2,-)}(t_a - t_{n=1,+}(e_a^{(2,-)})),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which is exactly the same as in ( 29 ) or ( 32 ) , so that its further estimate is the same too .",
    "thus , the inequality ( 26 ) is satisfied even stronger than in the monotonous case .",
    "thus , we have proved the inequality ( 17 ) both for monotonous and non - monotonous @xmath106 .",
    "one can similarly prove the inequality    @xmath149    and similar inequalities related to branches with @xmath150 .",
    "so , the theorem has been proved for the case 1 .",
    "consider now the formal case when _",
    "@xmath90 changes its sign jump - wise at some @xmath151_. formally , the branches @xmath52 for the solutions of the euler equation abrupt at the discontinuity energy @xmath152 ( fig .",
    "3(b ) ) so that there may be time ranges where the euler equation does not possess any solution at all .",
    "however , it means only that there is no _ continuous _ path which would provide a minimum action in this time range ; the discontinuous path does exist though . in order to obtain its continuous approximation ,",
    "it is necessary to approximate the jump of @xmath90 by any sequence of continuous functions whose relevant coordinate range converges to the infinitesimal vicinity of the coordinate of the jump , @xmath153 .",
    "then the continuous extremal paths do exist while , as it follows from eq .",
    "( 24 ) , the limit of the sequence of the corresponding actions is equal to ( cf . fig .",
    "3(c ) )    @xmath154    where @xmath155 is an upper limit for a given branch in the discontinuous case ( cf . fig .",
    "the limit of the sequence of the corresponding continuous extremal paths is the following discontinuous path : its parts which correspond to @xmath156 beyond the immediate vicinity of @xmath153 coincide with those of the corresponding continuous path for @xmath157 while it stays in @xmath151 during the rest of the time i.e. during the interval @xmath158 . given that each path from the sequence satisfies the theorem , so does their discontinuous limit .",
    "the formal case when _",
    "@xmath159 is discontinuous _ can be proved analogously to the case 2 above .",
    "altogether , this proves the theorem on the whole .",
    "in this letter , i have rigorously proved that , in the problem of the noise - induced transition between points lying within a monotonous part of a potential of an overdamped one - dimensional system , action corresponding to solutions of the euler equation which possess two or more turning points is necessarily larger than action corresponding to solutions with one turning point .",
    "this means that the _ most probable transition path can not possess more than one turning point_. the proof is general , i.e. valid for any potential , any positions of the initial and final transition points , and any value of the transition time .",
    "the practical use of the theorem proved in the letter consists in the following : if one needs to calculate the non - stationary transition flux or probabilty density or any other quantity related to the non - stationary transition caused by a weak noise , then one may skip the calculation and analysis of all ( sometimes numerous ) partial contributions corresponding to solutions of the euler equation which possess more than one turning point .",
