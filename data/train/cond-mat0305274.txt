    "reaching substantial charging ( of the order of @xmath1 electrons per c@xmath0 molecule ) in a field - effect device requires enormous electric fields .",
    "as the induced charge is basically restricted to one monolayer of c@xmath0 @xcite , a rough estimate can be obtained from simple electrostatics : for neutrality the charge on the gate must equal that on the monolayer , hence the field originating from the gate electrode is given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the area per c@xmath0 molecule in the monolayer and @xmath1 is the number of induced electron charges per molecule .",
    "thus the external field is about 1  v /   per induced charge , corresponding to a voltage drop of about 10  v across the molecule . in such a strong external field",
    "the c@xmath0 molecules are strongly polarized .",
    "nevertheless , we find that their response is still in the linear regime .",
    "furthermore , in the charged monolayer , the field experienced by a molecule is screened by the polarization of the neighboring molecules . taking this into account , we find that the field is reduced by about a factor of two .",
    "calculating the splitting of the molecular levels in this screened homogeneous field , we find a quadratic stark effect , with the splitting of both , the @xmath4 and the @xmath5 level , becoming of the order of the band - width for a field corresponding to an induced charge of three to four charges per molecule .",
    "this seems to be consistent with the typical doping levels that had been reported .    for a more realistic description of the electrostatics in the field - effect device",
    ", we have , however , to go beyond considering only a homogeneous field .",
    "given the spherical shape of c@xmath0 , the natural approach is via a multipole expansion @xcite : we choose an external field and the corresponding induced charge per molecule .",
    "we determine the multipole expansion of the field generated by all other molecules about the molecule centered at the origin . using the linear response of a c@xmath0 molecule to multipole fields ( calculated _ ab initio _ ) , we determine the new charge distribution on the molecules and repeat the procedure until self - consistency is reached .    [ split ]    figure [ split ] shows the splitting of the molecular levels in the self - consistent multipole field for different doping levels . while for an external homogeneous field ( @xmath6 multipole ) the splitting is independent of the direction of the field , including the effect of the induced charge on the neighboring molecules breaks this symmetry .",
    "surprisingly , the asymmetry in the splitting is quite strong , even though the fields that break the symmetry are fairly weak compared to the homogeneous field .",
    "this is because the multipole potentials with even @xmath7 give rise to a _ linear _ stark effect , which changes sign with the external potential and which gives rise to a strong splitting even for weak fields .",
    "in addition it turns out @xcite that the splitting due to the @xmath6 and @xmath8 potentials add or subtract , depending on the sign of the external field : when inducing electrons they add for the @xmath4 level and almost cancel for the @xmath5 , while when inducing holes the situation is reversed .",
    "i.e. , when a molecular level is filled , the splitting is substantially enhanced .",
    "it reaches the order of the band width when inducing about two electrons , or somewhat more than two holes per molecule . beyond these fillings the effect of the stark splitting on the electronic structure of the c@xmath0 monolayer that carries the induced charge will clearly be very large , and one can definitely no longer speak of doping .",
    "as we have seen , the charge density of the c@xmath0 molecule is strongly polarized in an electric field , and one might expect that the main contribution comes from the polarization of the highest molecular orbital ( homo ) . calculating the change in the homo charge density , we find , however , that the dipole moment of the homo charge density is of the same order of magnitude as that of the total charge  _ but of the opposite sign _ ( see fig .",
    "[ antis ] ) .",
    "this surprising result can be understood , e.g. , in terms of perturbation theory : expanding the wave function to first order in the external field @xmath9 and calculating the dipole moment @xmath10 , we find that the leading term is given by a sum over the matrix element , squared , with all unperturbed molecular orbitals of different parity divided by the characteristic energy denominator .",
    "hence the main contribution comes from energetically close - by levels , and the sign of their contribution is determined by whether they are energetically above or below the level under consideration . for the homo in a molecule with a large homo - lumo gap",
    "this means that the contributions mainly come from the molecular levels below  implying antiscreening .",
    "we thus see that homo - antiscreening should be quite general for molecules with large homo - lumo gap , and , in fact , it can also be found , e.g. , in the series of polyacenes : benzene , naphthalene , anthracene , tetracene , and pentacene .",

    "since the bands in the fullerenes are narrow , while the coulomb repulsion between two electrons on the same molecule is sizable , the doped fullerenes show effects of strong correlation .",
    "it is , e.g. , only due to orbital degeneracy that a@xmath12c@xmath0 is metallic and not a mott insulator @xcite . in field - doped fullerenes",
    "the electrons are restricted to a monolayer @xcite .",
    "hence the number of nearest neighbors to which an electron can hop is reduced and the bands are even more narrow .",
    "it is therefore expected that the mott transition occurs at critical values of the coulomb interaction @xmath13 below those found in the bulk . to determine the transition point , we have performed quantum monte carlo calculations @xcite for a doped ( 111)-layer ( without stark splitting ) and find that the mott transition occurs between @xmath14  ev for doping with three electrons , and @xmath15  ev for the half - filled @xmath5 band ( see fig .",
    "[ egap ] ) . for integer dopings other than half - filling",
    "the transition is expected to occur for even smaller values of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the splitting of the molecular levels in the electric field should weaken the effect of the degeneracy on the mott transition and lead to still smaller values of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "in particular for the @xmath5 orbital , the strong electron - phonon coupling might lead to a further reduction of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "one has , however , to keep in mind that the coulomb interaction @xmath13 depends on the environment of the molecule .",
    "screening due to the polarization of the neighboring molecules is , e.g. , responsible for a large reduction of @xmath13 in the crystal as compared to the value for an isolated molecule @xcite .",
    "likewise , it is to be expected that for a molecule in the monolayer next to the gate dielectric , @xmath13 might be substantially changed from the bulk value .",
    "this effect is , however , hard to quantify without knowing the microscopic structure of the oxide - c@xmath0 interface .",
    "nevertheless it seems likely that field - doped c@xmath0 should be insulating at integer fillings .",
    "in a@xmath12c@xmath0 the superconducting transition temperature @xmath17 increases with increasing lattice constant , i.e. , with increasing density of states at the fermi level @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to try the same for field - doped c@xmath0 .",
    "the simplest way to increase the distance of the molecules in the conducting monolayer is to apply uniaxial stress @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is the intercalation of the crystal with inert molecules .",
    "in fact , for field - doped c@xmath0 intercalated with haloform molecules spectacularly increased transition temperatures have been reported @xcite .",
    "a subsequent analysis of the lattice structure of these crystals revealed , however , that the lattice is mainly expanded perpendicular to the conducting layer , and that the density of states in the doped layer shows no correlation with the reported @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the additional coupling to the vibrations of the haloform molecules has been proposed as an alternative explanation of the enhancement of the transition temperature @xcite .",
    "it has , however , turned out that such a coupling is very small and , for the two - fold degenerate modes , is even excluded by symmetry @xcite . the reported enhancement of @xmath17 in haloform intercalated c@xmath0 is therefore not understood .",
