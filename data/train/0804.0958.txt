    "exact solutions at finite temperatures exist only in a very few cases  @xcite ; perturbation theory is usually inadequate while numerical methods have serious limitations , such as in the quantum monte - carlo method and its notorious sign problem . on the contrary",
    ", one can get important insights from the exact solutions for small clusters (  molecules \" ) .",
    "for example , squares or cubes are the building blocks , or prototypes , of solids with bipartite lattices , whereas triangles , tetrahedrons , octahedrons without electron - hole symmetry may be regarded as primitive units of typical frustrated systems ( triangular , pyrochlore , perovskite ) .",
    "exact studies of various cluster topologies can thus be very useful for understanding nanoparticles and respective bulk systems .",
    "one can take a further step and consider an inhomogeneous bulk system as a collection of many such decoupled clusters , which do not interact directly , but form a system in thermodynamic equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "thus we consider a collection of such  molecules \" , not at fixed average number of electrons per each cluster , but as a grand canonical ensemble , for fixed chemical potential @xmath3 .",
    "the electrons can be splintered apart by spin - charge separation due to level crossings driven by @xmath1 or temperature , so that the collective excitations of electron charge and spin of different symmetries can become quite independent and propagate incoherently .",
    "we have found that local charge and spin density of states or corresponding susceptibilities can have different pseudogaps which is a sign of spin - charge separation . for large @xmath1 near half filling ,",
    "holes prefer to be localized on separate clusters having mott - hubbard ( mh ) like charge pseudogaps  @xcite and nagaoka ferromagnetism ( fm )  @xcite ; otherwise , spin density waves or spin liquids may be formed . at moderate @xmath1 , this approach leads to reconciliation of charge and spin degrees with redistribution of charge carriers or holes between square clusters . the latter ,",
    "if present , can signal a tendency toward phase separation , or , if clusters  prefer \" to have two holes , it can be taken as a signature of pairing  @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , could imply imposed opposite spin pairing followed by condensation of charge and spin degrees into a bcs - like coherent state .",
    "although this approach for large systems is only approximate , it nonetheless gives very important clues for understanding large systems whenever correlations are local .",
