    "the parkes pulsar timing array ( ppta ) is a project which aims to take advantage of the extraordinary rotational stability of short period ( millisecond ) radio pulsars .",
    "the principal goal of the ppta is to make a direct detection of gravitational waves @xcite . for this purpose",
    "it is necessary to measure weekly times of arrival ( toas ) of @xmath120 pulsars with a precision between 100 and 500ns @xcite . in order to achieve this goal all systematic errors in the toas",
    "must be considered and , if possible , corrected .",
    "one such correction is the delay caused by the plasma between the pulsar and the earth .",
    "most of this plasma contribution is from the interstellar medium , but the contribution of the solar wind can not be neglected and the ionosphere will occasionally be important .",
    "the dispersion in the plasma is a linear effect and can , in principle be corrected exactly .",
    "the group delay , @xmath2 , is related to the integral of the electron density , @xmath3 , from the earth to the pulsar , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the `` dispersion measure '' .",
    "the dispersion constant @xmath6mhz@xmath7@xmath8pcs@xmath9 , @xmath10 is the observing frequency and @xmath11 the distance from the earth to the pulsar .",
    "when toas , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are measured at two frequencies , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the dm can be estimated using @xmath16    a rough estimate of the dm of a ( radio ) pulsar is generally obtained from the discovery observations .",
    "this estimate can be quickly refined by re - observing the pulsar with more widely separated frequencies . measured",
    "dms for currently known radio pulsars lie between 2.38 and 1235@xmath8pc and from 2.65 to 244@xmath8pc for the subset of millisecond pulsars @xcite .",
    "precise measurements of dm show that it often has significant time variations",
    ". a time delay of 100ns at an observing frequency of 1400mhz , the accuracy goal of the ppta , corresponds to a dm variation of @xmath17@xmath8pc .",
    "variations of this order can occur in the ionosphere only for zenith angles in excess of 80@xmath18 or during major geomagnetic storms , so ionospheric corrections will not normally be necessary . at this level of timing precision , significant variations in dm can occur due to the solar wind even when the pulsar is 60@xmath19 away from the sun .",
    "variations in the interstellar plasma dm result from plasma turbulence and usually have a kolmogorov power spectrum , implying that the variations are larger over longer time - scales . in the pulsars observed by the ppta project",
    ", such dm fluctuations can reach levels that require correction within a few days or weeks .",
    "it is clear that the goals of the ppta project can not be reached without measuring the dm and correcting for the plasma delay for each observation .",
    "the most precise toa measurements are usually obtained at a frequency of 1400mhz , but the only dual - band receiver available at the parkes telescope is at 685 and 3100mhz . thus the dm variations are measured using the dual - band system at different times than the toa observations at 1400mhz . since the dm varies relatively smoothly , the dm correction can be interpolated to the epoch of the primary toa observation . in this paper",
    "we use the first few years of dm measurements to test methods of correcting for the solar wind , to study the interstellar plasma turbulence and to derive algorithms for correcting the toa measurements .",
    "the contributions of the ionosphere and the solar wind have been well - studied and can be estimated by various methods independently of the ppta .",
    "the total electron content of the ionosphere ( `` tec '' ) is regularly monitored because it is needed to correct the global positioning system ( gps ) navigational system .",
    "a monitor is located at the parkes observatory , but it is seldom necessary to make this correction .",
    "corrections for the solar wind are implemented in the standard pulsar timing codes tempo and tempo2 @xcite . however , these assume a spherically symmetric solar wind with a constant scale factor and do not model observed variations in wind density with latitude , longitude and time which can be as much as a factor of four at any distance @xcite .",
    "the earlier package , tempo , assumes a higher density compared to tempo2 .",
    "neither of these is adequate for the desired ppta precision .",
    "the dm due to the interstellar medium varies for a variety of reasons . for example",
    ", variations are known to occur for some pulsars within supernova remnants , when wisps of ionised gas drift across the line of sight to the pulsar .",
    "for instance , the dm of the vela pulsar decreased at a rate of 0.04@xmath8pcyr@xmath9 from 1970 to 1985 @xcite",
    ". similarly the crab pulsar shows variations up to 0.02@xmath8pcyr@xmath9 over 15yr @xcite .",
    "pulsars in binary systems which exhibit eclipses show dm variations from the ionised envelope of the companion object .",
    "these have been measured for two of the binary pulsars in the globular cluster 47 tucanae @xcite .",
    "the dm change of 0.0065@xmath8pc for one of these , psr  j0023@xmath07203j , is 100 times the level that would require correction for the ppta pulsars .",
    "even larger changes have been observed in psr  b1259@xmath063 which is in orbit with a massive b2e star , reaching 10.7 and 7.7@xmath8pc during the periastron passages of 1994 and 1997 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the dm also varies due to turbulent spatial variations which drift across the line of sight between the earth and the pulsar .",
    "these have commonly been characterised in the literature as linear slopes in dm .",
    "measurements of such @xmath20 values for four pulsars were discussed by @xcite who proposed that @xmath21 and modelled the variation using wedges of enhanced density .",
    "observations of 374 pulsars were presented by @xcite who found the same relationship . however",
    ", a better characterisation of the dm variations can be made using the theoretical spatial characteristics of a turbulent process .",
    "as shown later , in a turbulent model the relation @xmath22 arises naturally and does not require a wedge model .",
    "the spatial power spectrum of electron density was defined by @xcite as @xmath23 where @xmath24 scales the power spectrum ( and thus the total energy in the process ) , @xmath25 is the power - law exponent ( which is @xmath26 for a kolmogorov spectrum ) , @xmath27 is the outer scale and @xmath28 is the inner scale .",
    "physically the outer scale is identified with the largest scale in the medium , typically the size at which it becomes inhomogeneous , and the inner scale is the scale at which dissipation occurs .",
    "energy is introduced at some scale between @xmath27 and @xmath28 , supporting the spectrum .",
    "this energy ` cascades ' in frequency to @xmath28 where it is dissipated .",
    "turbulent variations in electron density can be estimated from dm variations and various diffractive phenomena such as angular scattering , pulse broadening and intensity scintillations .",
    "diffractive variations are caused by much smaller scale fluctuations in density and thus probe different regions of the spatial spectrum than dm variations .",
    "diffractive variations are modulated by refractive variations which can be used to probe scales between the diffractive and the dm scales .",
    "all these observed variations result from the motion of the line of sight through the scattering medium , thus spatial variations of scale @xmath29 are associated with temporal variations of scale @xmath30 by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the velocity of the line of sight with respect to the scattering plasma .",
    "therefore , the inner time - scale @xmath33 corresponds to @xmath34 .",
    "radio scattering observations , such as those mentioned above , are directly sensitive to a statistic called the `` phase structure function '' , @xmath35 , which is defined by @xmath36 ^ 2\\rangle , \\label{eq : stdiff}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the geometrical phase delay between the source and the observer and the angle brackets denote an ensemble average . for a power - law spatial spectrum with @xmath38 between the inner and outer scales , the structure function @xmath39 is given by @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "similarly , we can define a structure function for the dm variations : @xmath42 ^ 2\\rangle .",
    "\\label{eq : stdm}\\ ] ] at scales that are larger than the scale of refractive scintillation , the geometrical phase approaches the actual phase @xcite and these two structure functions can be related through the dispersion relation ( equation  [ eq : dm1 ] ) , @xmath43    the structure function was first used to investigate dm variations by @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the technique was applied to psr  j1939@xmath442134 ( b1937@xmath4421 ) by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the structure function was consistent with a power - law fluctuation spectrum with index @xmath25 between 11/3 , the kolmogorov value , and 4 .",
    "@xcite continued this work and obtained @xmath45 . from the approximate agreement of the diffractive timescale",
    "@xmath46 computed from equation  [ eq : sts ] and the directly measured value , @xcite inferred that the inner scale of the fluctuation spectrum , @xmath28 , was less than about @xmath47 m .",
    "recently , @xcite extended the data - span to 20yr and obtained @xmath48 which is consistent with the value expected for a kolmogorov spectrum and suggested @xmath49 m .",
    "@xcite presented the dm variations of a different millisecond pulsar , psr  j1824@xmath02452 ( b1821@xmath024 ) , and obtained @xmath50 which is also consistent with a kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "dispersion measure variations were measured for six pulsars by @xcite and structure functions were obtained for psrs b0834 + 06 , b0823 + 26 and b0919 + 06 . measured power - law indices were in the range 3.77 to 3.87 with uncertainties of 0.04 or less .    assuming that the dm variations are due to turbulence then ,",
    "from the definition of the structure function , the `` slope '' @xmath51 , averaged over an interval @xmath52 , will be a random variable with an rms of @xmath53^{1/2}/\\tau$ ] .",
    "this can be related to the mean dm value by the distance to the pulsar @xmath11 as both dm and @xmath54 are proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "thus the observed result that @xmath55 is expected for any turbulent medium and does not require ad hoc models such as the wedge model of @xcite .",
    "this proportionality will be valid for spatial scales @xmath56 that are less than the parsec scale of interstellar clouds , since it assumes that contributions to the dm fluctuations from various points on the line of sight add incoherently",
    ".    there have been three dissipation mechanisms discussed in the literature : ion cyclotron damping ( which is the primary mechanism in the solar wind ) , landau damping and ion - neutral collisional damping .",
    "it is not thought that landau damping is important in the ism @xcite .",
    "ion cyclotron damping will certainly occur if the turbulent cascade reaches the small spatial scales involved .",
    "it occurs at the ion inertial scale @xcite , @xmath57 and has been clearly observed in the solar wind .",
    "expected scales in the ism range from 300 to 3000 km and it has almost certainly been observed at scales of 300 to 800 km using pulse broadening observations @xcite .",
    "damping due to ion - neutral collisions is also a resonant process that occurs near the ion - neutral collision frequency and would result in scales of @xmath130au in typical warm ism conditions @xcite .",
    "the ppta , which commenced observations in february 2004 , uses the parkes 64-m radio telescope to make timing observations of 20 millisecond pulsars .",
    "one , psr  j1824@xmath02452 , lies within the globular cluster m28 , the others within the disk of our galaxy .",
    "table  [ tb : sum ] lists basic parameters for the 20 ppta pulsars : j2000 name , period ( @xmath58 ) , period derivative ( @xmath59 ) , orbital period ( @xmath60 ) if the pulsar is in a binary system , dm , distance based on the ne2001 electron density model @xcite unless the annual parallax or another independent distance estimate is available , total proper motion ( @xmath61 ) and ecliptic latitude ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "because psrs  j1022@xmath441001 and j1730@xmath02304 lie very close to the ecliptic plane , timing methods can not provide a precise proper motion in ecliptic latitude ; for these two pulsars the proper motion in ecliptic longitude is given .",
    "each pulsar is typically observed at intervals of 23 weeks at frequencies close to 685mhz ( 50 cm ) , 1400mhz ( 20 cm ) and 3100mhz ( 10 cm ) , where the band designations ( based on wavelength ) are given in parentheses .",
    "we have used three backend systems : a wideband correlator ( wbc ) , a digital filterbank system ( dfb1 ) and the caltech - parkes - swinburne recorder 2 ( cpsr2 ) , a coherent dedispersing system , all of which record orthogonal linear polarisations .",
    "the wbc provides 2-bit sampling with a bandwidth of up to 1024mhz for the earlier data .",
    "the dfb1 was installed in 2005 june and allows 8-bit sampling of a 256 mhz bandwidth at 10 cm and 20 cm .",
    "observations at 10 and 50 cm are obtained simultaneously using a dual - band receiver providing bandwidths of 64mhz at 50 cm and 1024mhz at 10 cm .",
    "most observations at 20 cm are made using the central beam of the parkes multibeam receiver although the `` h - oh '' receiver has occasionally been used for observations in this band .",
    "data are simultaneously recorded using the cpsr2 baseband recording system with 2-bit sampling of two 64-mhz bands , centred on 1341 and 1405mhz respectively , and either the wbc or dfb1 with 256 mhz bandwidth . at 50 cm",
    ", data are recorded using one band of cpsr2 . for all receivers ,",
    "a linearly polarised broad - band calibration signal can be injected into the feed at @xmath63 to the two signal probes .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , < , < , > , < , > , < \" , ]",
    "we have shown that correction for the plasma delay is essential for the purposes of the ppta project and have developed an optimal way of applying this correction .",
    "we also show that the spherically symmetric solar wind models included in the pulsar timing packages tempo and tempo2 are of marginal value .",
    "more sophisticated models may be useful , especially in situations where it is difficult or impossible to measure the dm variations directly .",
    "we have analysed the observed dm variations and found that most are consistent with a simple kolmogorov model of interstellar turbulence with dissipation at a relatively small scale such as would be caused by ion cyclotron damping .",
    "however at least two of the 15 pulsars for which we can estimate the spectral exponent require a steeper spectrum and suggest strongly that ion - neutral collisions are important in damping the turbulence spectrum at au scales .",

    "the measured estimate of @xmath114 is therefore given by @xmath115\\frac{k}{\\nu_2^{-2}-\\nu_1^{-2}}\\nonumber\\\\ & = &   ( t_{g2}-t_{g1})\\frac{k}{\\nu_2^{-2}-\\nu_1^{-2}}+\\delta \\mbox{dm}(t)\\nonumber   \\\\ & & + [ n_2(t)-n_1(t)]\\frac{k}{\\nu_2^{-2}-\\nu_1^{-2}}.   \\label{eq : bcr }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after correcting for the dm variations , by subtracting the corresponding time offsets from @xmath108 , we obtain a set of corrected toas , @xmath116 , which are given by , @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 . note that , since @xmath120 , contributions to the timing residuals which are frequency independent and thus the same in @xmath12 and @xmath13 , appear unchanged in @xmath121 .",
    "this is an important property of the correction algorithm because interesting contributions such as the signature of gravitational waves , planets orbiting the pulsar , or ephemeris errors are unaltered by the correction .",
    "comparing equations  [ eq : to ] and [ eq : cr ] we see that the variance of the white noise has increased from @xmath122 to @xmath123 although the dm noise has been eliminated .",
    "we can improve the variance in @xmath121 by smoothing @xmath124 before subtracting it from @xmath108 , because smoothing reduces the white noise more than the @xmath114 variations .",
    "the white variance in @xmath124 is reduced by the smoothing number @xmath125 .",
    "it is hard to calculate the effect of smoothing @xmath114 analytically , but we found numerically that the variance of equally sampled @xmath126 \\approx 0.5   d_{\\rm dm}(t_{sm}/2\\pi)$ ] where @xmath127 and @xmath128 is the sampling time ( typically 15d ) .",
    "however , the white noise in the smoothed @xmath124 is partially correlated with that in @xmath108 , so we have finally the variance in @xmath121 @xmath129 we minimise this numerically .",
    "in fact , the data are not equally sampled so we first interpolate the raw data on to an equally spaced array before smoothing . to check the effect of re - sampling we compared the theory above with a simulation .",
    "we realised 50 samples of @xmath114 from a population matching @xmath130 with the actual data sampling .",
    "then we interpolated the simulated data onto an equally spaced array and found the @xmath125 which best corrected for @xmath114 . in all cases",
    "the minimum is very broad so it makes little difference whether one uses the theoretical or simulated value of @xmath125 .",
    "however , the simulation is easy to implement and will be correct even in the case of an unusual distribution of samples .",
    "the tempo2 software was designed to allow for easy addition of new features and functionality in the form of plug - ins to the main package . during this work",
    "we have produced the following new plug - in packages which are now available as part of the tempo2 distribution ( full details are available from our web - site , http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/tempo2 ) :    * calcdm : this plug - in contains the algorithms described in this paper .",
    "this plug - in allows the user to calculate and plot @xmath131 and obtain the corresponding structure function . * sf : calculates and plots the structure function of the timing residuals . *",
    "simism : allows data - sets to be simulated in order to study the effect of a kolmogorov process on pulsar timing residuals .",
    "the program difftime can be used to calculate @xmath46 and @xmath75 for most pulsar observations .",
    "this software is available as part of the psrchive software distribution ( http://psrchive.sourceforge.net ) ."
