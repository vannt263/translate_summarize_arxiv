    "due to their practical importance , multi - agent collision avoidance and control have been extensively studied across different communities including ai , robotics and control . considering continuous stochastic trajectories , reflecting each agent s uncertainty about its neighbours time - indexed locations in an environment space , we exploit a distribution - independent bound on collision probabilities to develop a conservative collision - prediction module .",
    "it avoids temporal discretisation by stating collision - prediction as a one - dimensional optimization problem .",
    "if mean and standard deviation are computable lipschitz functions of time , one can derive lipschitz constants that allow us to guarantee collision prediction success with low computational effort .",
    "this is often the case , for instance , when dynamic knowledge of the involved trajectories is available ( e.g. maximum velocities or even the stochastic differential equations ) .    to avoid collisions",
    "detected by the prediction module , we let an agent re - plan repeatedly until no more collisions occur with a definable probability . here , re - planning refers to modifying a control signal ( influencing the basin of attraction and equilibrium point of the agent s stochastic dynamics ) so as to bound the collision probability while seeking low plan execution cost in expectation . to keep the exposition concrete",
    ", we focus our descriptions on an example scenario where the plans correspond to sequences of setpoints of a feedback controller regulating an agent s noisy state trajectory .",
    "however , one can apply our method in the context of more general policy search problems .    in order to foster low social cost across the entire agent collective , we compare two different coordination mechanisms .",
    "firstly , we consider a simple fixed - priority scheme @xcite , and secondly , we modify an auction - based coordination protocol @xcite to work in our continuous setting .",
    "in contrast to pre - existing work in auction - style multi - agent planning ( e.g. @xcite ) and multi - agent collision avoidance ( e.g. @xcite ) , we avoid _ a priori _ discretizations of space and time .",
    "instead , we recast the coordination problem as one of incremental open - loop policy search .",
    "that is , as a succession of continuous optimisation or root - finding problems that can be efficiently and reliably solved by modern optimisation and root - finding techniques ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "while our current experiments were conducted with linear stochastic differential equation ( sde ) models with state - independent noise ( yielding gaussian processes ) , our method is also applicable to any situation where mean and covariances can be evaluated .",
    "this encompasses non - linear , non - gaussian cases that may have state - dependent uncertainties ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "this preprint is an extended and improved version of a conference paper that appeared in _ proc . of the 13th international conference on autonomous agents and multiagent systems ( aamas 2014 ) _",
    "@xcite .",
    "multi - agent trajectory planning and task allocation methods have been related to auction mechanisms by identifying locations in state space with atomic goods to be auctioned in a sequence of repeated coordination rounds ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , even in finite domains the coordination is known to be intractable  for instance the sequential allocation problem is known to be np - hard in the number of goods and agents @xcite . furthermore , collision avoidance corresponds to non - convex interactions .",
    "this renders the coordination problem inapplicable to standard optimization techniques that rely on convexity of the joint state space . in recent years",
    ", several works have investigated the use of mixed - integer programming techniques for single- and multi - agent model - predictive control with collision avoidance both in deterministic and stochastic settings @xcite . to connect the problem to pre - existing mixed - integer optimization tools",
    "these works had to limit the models to dynamics governed by linear , time - discrete difference equations with state - independent state noise .",
    "the resulting plans were finite sequences of control inputs that could be chosen freely from a convex set .",
    "the controls gained from optimization are open - loop  to obtain closed - loop policies the optimization problems have to be successively re - solved on - line in a receding horizon fashion . however",
    ", computational effort may prohibit such an approach in multi - agent systems with rapidly evolving states .",
    "furthermore , prior time - discretisation comes with a natural trade - off . on the one hand , one would desire a high temporal resolution in order to limit the chance of missing a collision predictably occurring between consecutive time steps . on the other hand , communication restrictions , as well as poor scalability of mixed - integer programming techniques in the dimensionality of the input vectors , impose severe restrictions on this resolution . to address this trade - off",
    ", @xcite proposed to interpolate between the optimized time steps in order to detect collisions occurring between the discrete time - steps . whenever a collision was detected they proposed to augment the temporal resolution by the time - step of the detected collision thereby growing the state - vectors incrementally as needed . a detected conflict , at time @xmath0 ,",
    "is then resolved by solving a new mixed - integer linear programme over an augmented state space , now including the state at @xmath0 .",
    "this approach can result in a succession of solution attempts of optimization problems of increasing complexity , but can nonetheless prove relatively computationally efficient .",
    "unfortunately , their method is limited to linear , deterministic state - dynamics .",
    "another thread of works relies on dividing space into polytopes @xcite , while still others @xcite adopt a potential field . in not accommodating uncertainty and stochasticity ,",
    "these approaches are forced to be overly conservative in order to prevent collisions in real systems .",
    "in contrast to all these works , we will consider a different scenario .",
    "our exposition focuses on the assumption that each agent is regulated by influencing its continuous stochastic dynamics .",
    "for instance , we might have a given feedback controller with which one can interact by providing a sequence of setpoints constituting the agent s plan .",
    "while this restricts the choice of control action , it also simplifies computation as the feedback law is fixed .",
    "the controller can generate a continuous , state - dependent control signal based on a discrete number of control decisions , embodied by the setpoints .",
    "moreover , it renders our method applicable in settings where the agents plants are controlled by standard off - the - shelf controllers ( such as the omnipresent pid - controllers ) rather than by more sophisticated customized ones . instead of imposing discreteness",
    ", we make the often more realistic assumption that agents follow continuous time - state trajectories within a given continuous time interval . unlike most work @xcite in this field , we allow for stochastic dynamics , where each agent can not be certain about the location of its team - members .",
    "this is crucial for many real - world multi - agent systems .",
    "the uncertainties are modelled as state - noise which can reflect physical disturbances or merely model inaccuracies .",
    "while our exposition s focus is on stochastic differential equations , our approach is generally applicable in all contexts where the first two moments of the predicted trajectories can be evaluated for all time - steps . as noted above",
    ", this paper is an extended version of work that has been published in the proceedings of aamas14 @xcite and an earlier stage of this work was presented at an icml @xcite workshop .",
    "* task*. our aim is to design a collision - detection module that can decide whether a set of ( predictive ) stochastic trajectories is collision - free ( in the sense defined below ) .",
    "the module we will derive is guaranteed to make this decision correctly , based on knowledge of the first and second order moments of the trajectories alone . in particular , no assumptions are made about the family of stochastic processes the trajectories belong to . as the required collision probabilities will generally have to be expressed as non - analytic integrals , we will content ourselves with a fast , _ conservative _ approach .",
    "that is , we are willing to tolerate a non - zero false - alarm - rate as long as decisions can be made rapidly and with zero false - negative rate . of course",
    ", for certain distributions and plant shapes , one may derive closed - form solutions for the collision probability that may be less conservative and hence , lead to faster termination and shorter paths . in such cases",
    ", our derivations can serve as a template for the construction of criterion functions on the basis of the tighter probabilistic bounds .",
