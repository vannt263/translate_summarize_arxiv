[ f4 ] where it is demonstrated how the plate - shaped layer @xmath21 is cut off and separated by the body @xmath80 in other words , we consider the auxiliary steklov spectral problem@xmath81@xmath82@xmath83 the asymptotic analysis of ( [ 1.12])-([1.14 ] ) is rather standard ( cf . @xcite and others ) . however",
