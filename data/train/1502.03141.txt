    "detection of the high - redshift galaxies is a primary frontier in observational cosmology .",
    "sampling and analyzing the properties of different types of high - redshift sources will constrain galaxy formation and star formation histories at different epochs , and explain their role in reionization and metal enrichment of the universe @xcite .",
    "for instance , dusty star - forming galaxies at a redshift range @xmath3 are the most luminous galaxies at that epoch and host a considerable fraction of star formation at @xmath4 @xcite , which includes the epoch when the star - formation rate density peaked @xcite . despite their leading role in the history of galaxy formation ,",
    "this population of galaxies has not been well studied yet due to dust obscuration , and is surveyed at present at sub - millimeter wavelengths .",
    "a reliable number counts of resolved sources from this population are being provided for the first time @xcite by the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "another population of high redshift sources which is not well constrained at the moment are the galaxies existing during the epoch of reionization and observed in their rest - frame uv at redshifts out to @xmath5 by the wide field camera 3 infrared channel ( wfc3/ir , @xcite ) on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , with plans to push this frontier to even higher redshifts with the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) .",
    "the identification of these galaxies is done based on the lyman - break technique which relies on the absorption of ultra - violet photons at wavelengths shortward of the redshifted ly-@xmath6 line due to neutral hydrogen fraction . because the uv luminosity of the lyman - break galaxies strongly correlates with the star formation rates @xcite , establishing the uv luminosity function at high redshift",
    "is an essential step towards measuring the halo abundances at these redshifts ( e.g. , via abundance - matching techniques @xcite ) and assessing the impact of these galaxies on the reionization of cosmic hydrogen in the first billion years after the big bang .",
    "the observable properties of any high - redshift population of sources , such as their abundance and luminosity function , differ from the intrinsic ones , since their radiation is subject to gravitational lensing . along a random line of sight ,",
    "photons are deflected on their path from the distant galaxies to the observer , a process which can be described statistically @xcite . in rare cases when the minimal separation between the center of the foreground structure and the trajectory of the photon ( referred to as its impact parameter ) is small enough",
    ", gravitational lensing has a strong effect on the light rays leading to a significant magnification of the background galaxy , multiple images and a major distortion of the source appearance on the sky .",
    "the photon deflection has two main impacts on the observed sources : the fluxes are magnified and the solid angle within which the sources are observed is increased . both effects need to be taken into account when inferring the intrinsic properties of a background population from the observed ones .",
    "the efficiency of lensing depends on the properties of both the foreground and the background populations .",
    "for instance , for the same set of lenses the main contribution to strong lensing with magnification , @xmath7 , above 2 originates from structures at a mean redshift of @xmath8 when the sources are the sub - millimeter galaxies ( smgs ) located at @xmath9 ; while the lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath10 are most affected by foreground objects at @xmath11 .",
    "however , for any background population the strongest effect of lensing is expected to be on the rare brightest sources .",
    "this is because an observed bright source has an enhanced likelihood of being a magnified intrinsically fainter galaxy , which are much more abundant , thus leading to an overestimation of the intrinsically bright population and distorted appearance of its luminosity function .",
    "lensing appears to be a useful tool when counting the numbers of high redshift galaxies and measuring their luminosities .",
    "the magnification makes the selection of strongly lensed galaxies easy for large area galaxy surveys .",
    "for instance , more than @xmath12 of dusty sub - millimeter galaxies observed by the _",
    "space observatory were confirmed to be gravitationally lensed by an intervening foreground structure along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "in addition , faint galaxies behind massive foreground structures can be magnified above the detection limit .",
    "when background samples behind known foreground lens distribution are considered , the distortions introduced by strong gravitational lensing can be easily spotted and corrected for .",
    "for example , in the framework of the hubble frontier fields program faint background galaxies at @xmath13 magnified by up to a factor of @xmath14 by foreground massive galaxy clusters were detected down to the absolute magnitude of @xmath15 @xcite , which is almost two orders of magnitude dimmer than the faintest galaxies observed in random fields @xcite .",
    "along similar lines , @xcite used strong lensing by a foreground galaxy cluster to detect @xmath9 galaxies which are two orders of magnitude fainter than what is normally observed at this redshift . because strong lensing is so useful for the detection of faint high redshift sources ,",
    "its statistics and properties were widely studied in literature ( e.g. , by @xcite and references therein ) . however , strong lensing events are relatively rare with a raw probability for multiple images at the highest source redshifts of only @xmath16 @xcite . on the other hand , galaxies which are not strongly lensed still undergo magnification ( or de - magnification ) by foreground structure and",
    "can be mildly magnified without being multiply imaged . in this case",
    "the effect of lensing can be easily overlooked leading to an over ( or under ) prediction of the number counts of background galaxies , and thus , to an erroneous estimation of their properties .",
    "the effect of the intermediate and small magnifications on the observed properties of high redshift sources , such as their luminosity function , has not been properly addressed in the literature and is considered in this work for the first time .",
    "however , the importance of lensing events with intermediate magnifications is being realized ; for instance , @xcite mention the relevance of newly detected at @xmath17 sources with @xmath18 for the determination of the intrinsic luminosity function .    here",
    "we explore the effect of gravitational lensing by two types of foreground populations : ( i ) virialized halos hosting bright galaxies , and ( ii ) proto - clusters , i.e. , non - virialized mildly non - linear overdensities , on the luminosity functions of the sub - mm and lyman - break galaxies . in ",
    "2 we outline the basics of our lens model and compute the probability for lensing at each magnification , @xmath19 , which is necessary for deriving the observed luminosity functions . in  2.1 we carefully examine the case when the background sources are lbgs and lensing is done by virialized halos which host bright galaxies paying particular attention to the surface brightness of the source and the lens galaxies . in this setup",
    "the source images could be hidden behind an extended lens that appears to be bright in the observable range of wavelengths , which , as we find , has a crucial effect on the lensing statistics . in ",
    "3 we present our results , showing that if not accounted for , gravitational lensing with intermediate and small magnifications ( @xmath20 ) can be responsible for errors in the derived parameters of the observed source luminosity function of the two populations .",
    "finally , we conclude in  4 . throughout this work",
    ", we adopt the standard set of cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "a central ingredient of our calculation is the probability for lensing with each given magnification , @xmath19 .",
    "we analytically compute this quantity largely following the approach taken by @xcite , whose main assumption is that for each trajectory of a photon emitted by a source there is a single massive object which plays a dominant role in the photon s deflection and magnifies the background light by a factor of @xmath7 through gravitational lensing . in the cases",
    "when multiple images are expected to form we keep only the stronger magnified image motivated by the fact that it is easier to observe .",
    "our computational approach can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , for a lens hosted by a halo of mass @xmath21 and a source hosted by a halo of mass @xmath22 located at redshifts @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively the magnification at each impact parameter in the lens space , @xmath25 , is computed .",
    "next , running over all possible parameters that describe the lens - source system , one finds the fraction of the parameter space , @xmath26 , which yields magnifications higher then @xmath7 considering only the stronger magnified image in the case when multiple images are expected to form .",
    "finally , the lensing statistics is constructed by computing the probability for lensing with magnification larger than @xmath7 , @xmath27 , and then the probability for lensing with each given magnification , @xmath28 , is calculated , while the total flux is conserved ( @xmath29 ) and @xmath19 is normalized to unity over the entire range of magnifications ( see @xcite for complementary details ) .",
    "the factor @xmath26 can be simply written as , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the angular cross - section for lensing with magnification larger than @xmath7 .",
    "if the redshift distribution of sources is given , we should average @xmath26 over @xmath24 as well , as we do in the case of sub - mm galaxies taking their redshift distribution from the work by @xcite . in equation ( [ eq : fmu ] )",
    "@xmath32 is the angular diameter distance , and @xmath33 is the hubble constant at redshift @xmath34 .",
    "the comoving number density of objects , @xmath35 and the normalization factor , @xmath36 , are found using the sheth - tormen mass function @xcite . to correctly estimate the number density , @xmath37 , of the objects with masses between @xmath38 and @xmath39 per a logarithmic mass interval , @xmath40",
    ", one needs to specify the variance of fluctuations in the matter density at each mass scale ( which we calculate using the outputs of camb ) , and the critical overdensity at which the objects form , @xmath41 .",
    "the latter quantity depends on the type of the objects for which we want to know the number densities .",
    "as noted above , in this work we are interested in the effects produced by two kinds of foreground populations : ( 1 ) virialized massive halos for which the critical overdensity is just the standard value for collapse ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and ( 2 ) non - virialized objects . to model the population of non - virialized objects we rely on the fact that the radius of a growing overdensity is close to its value at turnaround ( the moment at which , in the framework of the spherical collapse model , the external mass shell has zero velocity ) during most of the evolution time of the overdense region .",
    "we then find the critical overdensity , @xmath41 , for the objects at turnaround by consistently solving the spherical collapse model with relevant cosmological parameters at each redshift , and plug it into the sheth - tormen prescription to get the number density of non - virialized halos .",
    "next we calculate the value of magnification at each impact parameter , which depends on the three - dimensional density profile of each lens as well as on its distance from the source and the observer . in treating objects at turnaround",
    "we consider their mean density in the context of the spherical top - hat collapse model .",
    "we follow the standard procedure ( e.g. , outlined by @xcite ) to find the magnification pattern for each overdensity . in general , the objects at turnaround are only mildly nonlinear having the overdensities of the order @xmath42 ( with the exact value being redshift dependent in @xmath43cdm ) which results in magnification of @xmath2 . such objects do not produce multiple images and thus can have only a mild effect on the observable population .    in the case of virialized halos",
    "the model is more complicated .",
    "conventionally , either the @xcite ( nfw ) or the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) profiles are used to model the three - dimensional density distribution .",
    "however , neither of the two profiles describes lensing by realistic galaxies close enough .",
    "in particular , observations of flat rotational curves in massive galaxies show that the mass distribution follows the sis profile within 10 - 20 inner kpc @xcite , while the outskirts are better described by the nfw profile @xcite .",
    "therefore we adopt a combination of sis and nfw through a piecewise form for the magnification as a function of the impact parameter in the lens plane @xmath44 and connect the two profiles at a projected radius @xmath45 that characterizes the extent of the luminous core of the galaxy ( twice the half light radius ) .",
    "the last ingredient needed for equation ( [ eq : fmu ] ) is the angular cross - section for lensing , @xmath31 . to calculate this quantity for each lens - source pair we go over all @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the maximal value of the impact parameter that allows a single lens to dominate .",
    "in the case when multiple images are produced we consider the @xmath25 which corresponds to the brightest image only . by averaging over all the masses of lenses at each redshift",
    ", we first calculate the mean separation between halos , @xmath48 , in terms of either the mean virial radius ( averaged over halos masses at each redshift ) or the typical radius of a structure that is turning around . in the former case we find @xmath49 , while in the latter case @xmath50 , with the exact value in each case being redshift dependent .",
    "next , we assume that each given object dominates the lensing effect for the impact parameters smaller than @xmath51 times its radius , for which we adopt either a virial radius , and thus @xmath52 , or a radius at turnaround , @xmath53 , depending on the case studied .",
    "the resulting @xmath19 is shown on the left panels of figure [ fig : pdfs ] for the two source populations , i.e. , lbgs at @xmath54 and for smgs at @xmath55 ( which represents the center of the current redshift sample of smgs ) , and for the two lens populations , i.e. , for virialized and non - virialized halos . for lbgs",
    ", a particular care should be taken when computing the lensing statistics since the foreground galaxies are normally bright in the band which refers to the rest - frame uv of the lbgs .",
    "this effect introduces a suppression in the probability for lensing at strong and intermediate magnifications , which we also show on the figure , and discus in full detail in  2.1 .",
    "for both sets of sources , lbgs and smgs , and in the case when lensing is due to the highly nonlinear overdense regions ( i.e. , virialized halos ) , the large magnification tail of @xmath19 scales as @xmath56 as expected @xcite , and all values of magnifications can be obtained , including very large @xmath7 for which einstein rings are produced . on the contrary ,",
    "in the case when lensing is due to the mildly non - linear objects , @xmath19 drops very fast with magnification , not allowing for the possibility of strong lensing at all .",
    "however , as we see in  3 , the effect of the objects at turnaround on the bright end of the luminosity function can be comparable to lensing by halos when observing a sample of field galaxies which do not experience strong lensing .",
    "the effect of gravitational lensing can also be interpreted as modification of the luminosity distances . on the right panels of figure [ fig : pdfs ]",
    "we show the probability distribution for the fractional change in the luminosity distance due to the magnification of the flux , @xmath57 .",
    "although the probability distribution of @xmath58 peaks around zero ( i.e. , magnification has no effect in average around the sky ) there is dispersion in the values of the luminosity distances simply because along a random line of sight the flux can be magnified by a random factor @xmath7 .",
    "this dispersion in the luminosity distance of high redshift objects should be carefully accounted for . in particular , the precision with which cosmological parameters from a high - redshift sample of standard candles can be determined is expected to be affected by gravitational lensing . however , a more quantitative determination of the precision in the cosmological parameters measured using the high - redshift standard candles , as well as the effect of lensing , is beyond the scope of current paper .",
    "even when a source is located behind a bright lens , it can still be separated based on its different colors @xcite . here",
    "we apply another argument , showing that if magnified enough , the source can outshine the foreground galaxy and be observable even when located behind its extended luminous core , i.e. , surface brightness may be larger than that of the lens for some values of the impact parameter .",
    "this argument introduces a new criterion , previously ignored in the discussions of the galaxies luminosity function , which is relevant in the case of the high - redshift lbgs .",
    "since foreground galaxies are normally bright in the observed bands which correspond to the rest frame uv bands of the sources , some images are too faint to be seen through the bright part of the lens even when they are magnified . as a result , the probability to observe lbgs with intermediate and large magnifications is reduced , as we show below .    in our analysis",
    "we relate to each massive halo an exponential surface brightness profile with a half light radius @xmath59 @xcite and a total uv luminosity @xmath60 .",
    "the uv luminosity of each halo is directly proportional to the star formation rate in the halo , ( @xmath60/erg s@xmath61 hz@xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 ( sfr / m@xmath65 yr@xmath61 ) @xcite , which in turn scales with its mass and redshift @xcite .",
    "the lensing kernel for lbgs at @xmath66 is dominated by contribution from lenses at @xmath67 , thus implying that the emission wavelength of @xmath68 sources is almost an order of magnitude shorter than that of the lens galaxy .",
    "when the high - redshift sources are observed at the rest - frame wavelength of 1500 a ( e.g , by wfc3 camera on board hst ) , the foreground galaxy would frequently be observed at the wavelengths bluer than the balmer jump . ignoring lines , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of galaxies at the corresponding wavelength band",
    "is expected to be rather flat .",
    "we use a toy model to include the sed of foreground galaxies and account for k - corrections .",
    "our toy model for the galaxy sed consists of a power - law with the observed slope according to @xcite for wavelengthes within uv - continuum .",
    "we model the balmer jump adopting observations by @xcite , and assume a flat spectrum at longer wavelengthes . a more detailed treatment of k - corrections in a more solid way",
    ", e.g. using sed models provided by @xcite , goes beyond the scope of this paper .    using all the model ingredients described above",
    "we calculate the observed flux per unit frequency for both the source and the lens including the magnification of the source .",
    "this allows us to find impact parameters ( and magnifications ) for which the source surface brightness is higher than that of the lens .",
    "such regions of the parameter space contribute to the lensing statistics . in figure",
    "[ fig : lum ] we show the observed fluxes for several lens - source pairs accounting also for the magnification of the background galaxy by the foreground galaxy .",
    "specifically , we show the cases of two sources @xmath69 m@xmath65 at @xmath54 ( left panel ) and @xmath70 m@xmath65 at @xmath71 ( right panel ) lensed by three different lenses ( m@xmath72 m@xmath65 , m@xmath73 m@xmath65 and m@xmath74 m@xmath65 ) at @xmath75 .",
    "the masses of the deflectors were chosen to cover the most typical ( m@xmath72 m@xmath65 ) and massive ( m@xmath74 m@xmath65 ) structures at that epoch .",
    "our choice of @xmath22 is motivated by the derived masses of the halos hosting lyman - break galaxies recently reported by @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "e.g. , for an m@xmath74 m@xmath65 lens at @xmath76 and a source of m@xmath77 m@xmath65 at @xmath54 ( blue curve on the left panel of figure [ fig : lum ] ) , there is a range of impact parameters for which the magnified source is brighter than the lens and thus can be observed . in this particular case ,",
    "the range of impact parameters at which the image is visible includes @xmath78 kpc and @xmath79 .",
    "note that the range of @xmath25 smaller than the radius of the einstein ring ( here @xmath80 kpc ) shown with light grey curves on the figure , is attributed to the weakly magnified images and is not included in the calculation of @xmath19 plotted in figure [ fig : pdfs ] .",
    "this means that for @xmath81 the range of magnifications between @xmath82 at @xmath83 kpc and @xmath84 at @xmath85 kpc is not observable and such magnifications do not contribute to our lensing statistics .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : lum ] shows that this phenomenon is essentially the same for a different choice of the mass and redshift of the source .",
    "however , the precise range of the impact parameters within which the magnified source can be observed in each case depends on the masses and redshifts of both the lens and the source .",
    "the fact that in some cases ( for some values of the impact parameter ) the foreground galaxies outshine the background lbg sources affects statistics of gravitational lensing , as shown in figure [ fig : pdfs ] . within the outlined setup , probability of obtaining any magnifications ( @xmath86 )",
    "is affected by this selection criterion , as can be seen from the figure where @xmath19 is shown with and without such a reduction ; however , the slope of the probability distribution at large magnifications @xmath87 ( strong lensing regime ) is not strongly affected by this effect and scales as @xmath56 . as shown in the next section",
    ", the reduction in @xmath19 affects the observed luminosity function of lbgs at its bright end .",
    "to account for the effect of gravitational lensing on the luminosity function , one must convolve the differential probability @xmath19 which we found in  2 with the intrinsic luminosity function of the population under consideration , @xmath88 . the observed luminosity function , @xmath89 is modified by lensing and depending on @xmath19 may have a completely different shape than the intrinsic one .",
    "the effect of lensing on the observed properties of sources depends on the shape of the intrinsic luminosity function of the population under consideration .",
    "in particular , if @xmath88 is flatter than @xmath90 , then lensing has only a minor effect on the observed luminosity function @xcite .",
    "here we apply our findings to the lbgs at redhifts @xmath91 and to the smgs at @xmath55 .",
    "although rather steep , the faint - end luminosity function of each one of these two populations appears to be flatter than the critical dependence , i.e. , @xmath92 .",
    "therefore lensing is not expected to have any impact on the number counts of intrinsically faint sources . however , at luminosities higher than a characteristic value , @xmath93 ( or at the fluxes larger than a characteristic value @xmath94 ) , the luminosity function is expected to drop rapidly following either an exponential or a steep power - law . in this regime",
    "the effect of lensing is dramatic : it boosts the observed number counts of the brighter sources by magnifying the luminosities of intrinsically fainter ones .",
    "since the abundance of intrinsically faint galaxies is much higher than that of the bright ones , the increase of the observed number counts at the bright end is striking .",
    "specifically , the exponential drop of the schechter function of lbgs transforms into a power - law with the index of -3 when lensed @xcite .    at present",
    ", the bright end of the luminosity function is not very well constrained for both populations that we consider here due to the substantial cosmic variance @xcite . in the particular case of the lbgs at @xmath95 ,",
    "the data from goods - n or goods - s wfc3/ir surveys ( with the total area of @xmath96 arcmin@xmath97 ) suffer from the cosmic variance of @xmath98 on the overall number counts out of which the luminous sources beyond @xmath93 make only a small fraction @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the case of @xmath99 lbgs , counted in 5 independent @xmath100 candels survey fields , a total uncertainty of 10@xmath101 on the volume density of galaxies from cosmic variance is estimated @xcite . in the case of the smgs , the luminosity function",
    "is poorly understood at all the luminosities , and its redshift evolution and @xmath94 remain unconstrained .",
    "the first detailed surveys in the sub - mm range are currently on their way , for example with alma , and are expected to provide better constraints on the number counts of smgs .",
    "the effect of lensing on the luminosity functions of both lbgs and smgs may appear to be significant once these populations are better explored . in the following",
    "we analyze the effect of lensing on the luminosity functions for all possible magnifications , while paying particular attention to the impact of magnifications in the intermediate range @xmath102 , which is expected to affect most of the galaxies in the field , and comparing it with the case of strong lensing .",
    "the luminosity function of high - redshift galaxies is commonly fitted by the schechter form @xcite @xmath103 it is characterized by a power law dependence with index @xmath6 at the faint - end and an exponential drop at luminosities higher than the critical value @xmath93 , where @xmath104 determines the overall normalization of the number counts . as discussed above",
    ", the abundance of rare sources at the luminous end of the luminosity function , @xmath105 , is very sensitive to lensing due to the steepness of @xmath106 , which cuts - off exponentially .",
    "the effect of strong lensing on the luminosity function of the schechter form for high - redshift sources has been extensively studied in literature ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown that in the presence of significant gravitational lensing , the luminosity function acquires a power - law slope with an index @xmath107 at its bright - end , so that the apparent abundance of galaxies with @xmath108 is dramatically enhanced .",
    "observing such a strongly distorted luminosity function would flag strong lensing .",
    "however , only a small part of high - redshift galaxies are strongly lensed , while the vast majority of galaxies experiences either intermediate or weak lensing .",
    "we start by quantifying the effect of the `` common '' lensing on the luminosity function of lbgs . adopting a set of schechter parameters found by @xcite for lbgs observed at @xmath109 ( @xmath110 mpc@xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 where the uv magnitude is related to luminosity through @xmath114 ) ,",
    "we apply our calculated @xmath19 to estimate the observed luminosity function and bias , defined as a ratio of lensed to unlensed luminosity functions at a given luminosity , @xmath115 , which are shown on figure [ fig : lf ] for several cases of maximal magnification @xmath116 at two redshifts ( 6 and 12 ) . in particular , we show @xmath117 2 , 3 , and 1000 , where the last case includes the effect of strong lensing with einstein rings , including and excluding the reduction in @xmath19 of lbgs at intermediate magnifications discuses in  2.1 .",

    "however , the evolution of the faint - end slope and normalization with redshift was found to be significant , e.g. , the steepening in the effective shape of the uv luminosity function was found to be significant at the @xmath125 level @xcite . ]",

    "even for @xmath127 the schechter form develops a `` secondary knee '' , which ( when stronger magnifications are included ) transforms into the power law with the asymptotic index of @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "visually the effect is similar for all the redshifts at which the luminosity function has been observed , @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "lastly , the effect of lensing by non - virialized objects is small , but non - negligible .",

    "next , we quantify how strongly lensing with @xmath130 affects the fitting parameters of the schechter function . when estimating the effect on the luminosity function it is important to set the upper limit on the luminosity , @xmath131 , which we expect to observe .",
    "this number depends on both the intrinsic distribution of high - redshift galaxies as well as on the volume of the survey .",
    "if the survey volume is too small , it will not sample the brightest rarest sources .",
    "in particular , @xcite expect to find sources with apparent magnitudes in the range @xmath132 at @xmath68 ( which corresponds to the range from @xmath133 to @xmath134 ) using the hubble ultra - deep field .",
    "in this case @xmath135 and the data are not expected to be sensitive to lensing .",

    "thus there exist a variety of functions that can equally well fit the number counts observed so far @xcite .",
    "the two most popular fits which we use here are the schechter function and a broken power law .",

    "in particular , the bias in the case of the sources with a power - law form of the intrinsic luminosity function lensed by proto - clusters ( bottom right panel of figure [ fig : lfsm ] ) reaches 1.04 at the bright - end , while in the case of viriallized halos with @xmath202 it is @xmath203 . by comparing the numbers in table [ tab:2 ]",

    "more specifically , for lensing with some @xmath116 , a second `` knee '' develops around @xmath208 . at the flux values",
    "@xmath209 the luminosity function tends to develop slope equivalent to the one in the case of strong lensing ( which is @xmath210 in the case when number counts per unit flux are concerned ) , while at fluxes higher than @xmath211 the luminosity function retains its intrinsic power - law dependence .",
    "thus , the effect of lensing can be easily corrected for in this case .",
    "we considered the effects of gravitational lensing on the luminosity functions of lyman - break galaxies at @xmath10 and sub - mm galaxies at @xmath3 in the regime when a single lens has a dominant contribution .",
    "in particular , we made predictions for the galaxies `` in the field '' , i.e. , in surveyed volumes which are not strongly lensed , focusing on the intermediate range of magnifications ( @xmath212 ) produced by two types of lenses , namely virialized halos and non - virialized proto - clusters , and comparing the results to the cases which do include strong lensing .",
    "the regime of intermediate lensing was not studied in the literature and may appear to be important for future precision analysis of these two populations of sources when observed by instruments such as hst , jwst , alma and _",
    "we find that when a population of lyman - break galaxies with a schechter intrinsic luminosity function is subject to lensing with magnifications @xmath213 , the observed luminosity function can still be fitted by the schechter form , although with modified schechter parameters .",

    "in particular , we found that the overall effect of lensing ( including the strong lensing effects ) on the current schechter parameters @xcite is well below 1@xmath101 when only sources with uv magnitudes above @xmath217 are present ( as is expected for the most luminous objects in the hst surveys at @xmath218 @xcite ) .",
    "however , the effect of lensing starts to be increasingly important if intrinsically brighter sources are found in the sample , which may be the case in the future with wider surveyed areas . in this regime",
    ", the errors introduced by the weak and intermediate gravitational lensing may become significant , e.g. , lensing with maximal magnification of 2 of a population of bright sources at @xmath219 may result in more than @xmath220 discrepancy ( and more than @xmath221 discrepancy when the magnifications in the range @xmath222 are considered ) in the normalization of the luminosity function if sources with @xmath223 are present ( while the effect on critical luminosity remains at a percent level and we keep the faint - end slope fixed ) .",
    "if indeed intrinsically bright sources with @xmath224 exist so early on in the cosmic history , they would be valuable probes of the early universe .",
    "these rare objects are expected to form in highly overdense regions , to produce stars very early , and to start heating and ionizing gas earlier than in average over the universe .",
    "consequently , during the epoch of reionization ( @xmath225 ) such regions would create big bubbles of ionized gas over the otherwise neutral background , thus imprinting strong signature in the redshifted 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen which can be probed through tomography by radio telescopes such as the square kilometer array @xcite .",
    "an important point that we revealed in this paper is that particular care should be taken in the case in which lyman - break galaxies are lensed by massive halos that themselves host bright galaxies . in this case",
    "it is crucial to account for the magnification of the surface brightness of the source and compare it to that of the lens when deciding which sources are , in fact , observable and computing the lensing statistics .",
    "we showed that the range of impact parameters ( and thus magnifications ) for which the high - redshift sources are observable is reduced when the constraints from surface brightness profiles are accounted for .",
    "this leads to a suppressed probability for obtaining intermediate and strong magnifications which could result in up to a two orders of magnitude deficit in the luminosity function at high redshifts and high luminosities .    comparing lensing by virialized halos , which are strongly non - linear systems , to the role of proto - clusters , which we assumed to be overdense regions at the point of turnaround",
    ", we found that for a population of lyman - break galaxies at @xmath226 the effect of proto - clusters is similar to that of lensing by massive halos with the cutoff @xmath227 in magnification .",
    "for example , proto - clusters can introduce @xmath228 discrepancy in the normalization of the number counts of sources at @xmath229 , while lensing by virialized halos with @xmath204 contributes only @xmath230 when the suppression in lensing probability due to the surface brightness is taken into account ( and @xmath231 when it is ignored ) , and lensing with @xmath232 contributes @xmath168 ( @xmath214 ) .",
    "the effect of lensing on the luminosity function of sub - mm galaxies at @xmath0 was also considered in this work .",
    "since the intrinsic luminosity function of this population is highly unconstrained at the moment , the effect of lensing could appear to be either significant or negligible once this population is better explored , depending on the steepness of the luminosity function at the bright - end . in this work we considered two forms of the intrinsic luminosity function for this population ,",
    "i.e. , the schechter fit and the broken power law dependence . in the latter case , lensing with intermediate magnifications may cause significant distortions of the shape of the luminosity function , and thus the effect of lensing can be easily corrected for .",
    "the former case is qualitatively very similar to that of lyman - break galaxies , with the sole difference that there is no reduction in the lensing probability due to the large surface brightness of an extended lens .",
    "this is because the foreground lenses , which are drawn from common galaxies , are not expected to be bright at sub - millimeter wavelengths .",
    "the discrepancy in the schechter parameters introduced by lensing by virialized halos with intermediate magnifications ( @xmath212 ) is @xmath233 in the normalization and @xmath234 in the critical luminosity when the best fit to current data is considered at flux values @xmath235 mjy .",
    "finally , we found that the effect of lensing by proto - clusters on the galaxies at @xmath3 is negligible when compared to the lensing with intermediate magnifications by virialized halos .",
    "for example , for the best - fit intrinsic parameters that we considered above , proto - clusters introduce @xmath236 discrepancy in the normalization of the number counts , while lensing by virialized halos with @xmath204 contributes more than @xmath237 .",
    "lastly , we point out that magnification can have an important effect on the determination of the luminosity distances to the high - redshift standard candles . as a result of randomly distributed foreground structure",
