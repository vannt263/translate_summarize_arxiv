    "the formalism of quantum theory has many mathematical features , such as its use of complex vector spaces , whose physical origin is obscure . over the last two decades , there has been growing interest in the elucidation of the origin of these features by attempting to derive the quantum formalism from a set of physical assumptions , motivated by the belief that such an elucidation would contribute to the development of a clearer physical understanding of quantum theory , and might contribute to the development of a theory of quantum gravity  @xcite .",
    "the interest in reconstructing the quantum formalism in this way has been encouraged by belief in the hypothesis that the concept of information might be the key , hitherto missing , ingredient which , if appropriately conceptualized and formalized , might make such a reconstruction possible . in recent years",
    ", several attempts have been made to systematically explore the reconstruction of the quantum formalism from an informational starting point , for example  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the earliest such work , due to wootters  @xcite , is remarkable for showing that one can derive a correct , non - trivial physical prediction  ( malus law ) concerning a quantum experiment from a simple information - theoretic principle that concerns the amount of information obtained when measurements are performed upon a system , thereby providing clear support to the idea that the quantum formalism owes at least part of its mathematical structure to quantitative measures of information .",
    "however , the attempt to extend these principles in the direction of the quantum formalism meets with limited success .",
    "other attempts to quantify the gain of information and to formulate information - theoretic principles have also been made in  @xcite , but they are similarly restricted in their scope .",
    "more recently , a number of approaches  @xcite succeed in deriving a significant portion of the abstract formalism of quantum theory , but at the cost of abstract assumptions  ( typically involving the assumption of the complex number field ) that play a key role  -algebraic framework . ] , which significantly detracts from the understanding of the physical origin of the quantum formalism that they can provide .",
    "the approach presented here suggests that it is possible to derive a large part of the quantum formalism without recourse to abstract assumptions of this nature  .",
    "one way to understand the reason for thinking that information might have a fundamental role to play in our understanding of the physical world is as follows .",
    "suppose that an experimenter is presented with a system prepared in a way unknown to her . in classical physics",
    ", she can , in principle , perform an ideal measurement upon the system which provides complete information about the state of the system .",
    "we shall describe this situation as one of _ transparency _ :  intuitively , there is no insurmountable barrier between the system and the observer , so that , _ in principle _ , there is no fundamental distinction between the state of the system  ( the theoretical description of the reality ) on the one hand , and the experimenter s _ information _ about the state on the other . on the other hand , when the same situation is described using quantum physics",
    ", an ideal measurement performed on the system provides the experimenter with only _ partial _ information about the state of the quantum system .",
    "hence , transparency no longer holds .",
    "now , one might imagine that the experimenter could bypass this restriction by performing a large number of measurements on an ensemble of identically - prepared systems . however , if one assumes that an experimenter can , in principle , only perform a finite number of such measurements in a finite time , then , since the information that can be obtained by a finite number of measurements still only provides partial information , it follows that a fundamental distinction is drawn between the state of the system and the information that the experimenter can possibly have about the state .",
    "it is then natural to ask how the information that the experimenter gains can be quantified , and it seems reasonable to suppose that the information gain , and the manner in which this information is theoretically represented and manipulated , might be constrained by principles which give rise to non - trivial mathematical structure .",
    "this is the line of thinking we attempt to develop in this paper .    in the quantum description of the above situation",
    ", the limitation imposed on the information that the experimenter obtains can be traced directly to the fact that , in the quantum case , the state of the system only determines the probabilities of the results of a measurement performed upon it , a property we will refer to as _",
    "statistical determination_. as a consequence , a finite number of runs of an experiment where a measurement is performed on a system prepared in some unknown state only yields limited information about the state .",
    "for example , if the system is in the state  @xmath0 in the basis of a projective measurement ,  @xmath1 , where the  @xmath2 are the measurement probabilities and the  @xmath3 are phases , then @xmath4  runs of an experiment where measurement  @xmath1 is performed yield frequencies  @xmath5 , with  @xmath6 being the frequency of result  @xmath7 , which provide only a finite amount of information about the  @xmath2 .    in order to focus upon statistical determinacy and quantitatively",
    "explore its consequences , it is helpful isolate this feature , and to consider the process of information gain in the context of classical probability theory .",
    "consider the following simple situation .",
    "alice has two coins ,  @xmath8 and  @xmath9 , characterized by the probability distributions  @xmath10 and  @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "suppose that she chooses coin  @xmath8 , tosses it  @xmath4 times , and then sends the data to bob , without disclosing which coin she chose .",
    "if bob knows  @xmath12 and  @xmath13 , how much information does the data provide him about which coin was tossed ?    using bayes theorem and stirling s approximation for the case where  @xmath4 is large , on the assumption that coins  @xmath8 and  @xmath9 are _",
    "a priori _ equally likely to be chosen , one finds that  @xmath14 , where  @xmath15 is the probability that the tossed coin is  @xmath8 given the data , and likewise for  @xmath16 .",
    "when the probability distributions are close , so that  @xmath17 , the argument of the exponent can be expanded in the  @xmath18 to give  @xmath19 , where  @xmath20 .",
    "now , the information gained by bob ,  @xmath21 , is defined as  @xmath22 , with  @xmath23 being an entropy  ( uncertainty ) function such as the shannon entropy .",
    "but , since  @xmath24 and  @xmath25 is determined by  @xmath26 , once  @xmath23 is selected ,  @xmath21 is determined by  @xmath26 .",
    "this result immediately generalizes to the case where  @xmath12 and  @xmath13 are @xmath27-dimensional probability distributions  ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "hence , from an informational viewpoint , it is natural to endow the space of discrete probability distributions with a riemannian metric ,  @xmath20 .",
    "this metric , known as the _ information metric _ , is the central component of _ information geometry _  @xcite .",
    "in the course of this paper and a companion paper  @xcite  ( hereafter referred to as paper  ii ) , we show that , by formalizing some elementary features of quantum phenomena  ( particularly complementarity and global gauge invariance ) within this information - geometric framework , and supplementing these with a few additional plausible assumptions , it is possible to reconstruct the quantum formalism . in particular , we derive :    * the finite - dimensional abstract quantum formalism , namely  ( a )  the von neumann postulates for finite - dimensional systems , and  ( b )  the tensor product rule for expressing the state of a composite system in terms of the states of its subsystems . * the result due to wigner that a one - to - one map over the state space of a system which represents a symmetry transformation of the system is either unitary or antiunitary  @xcite .",
    "* the principal correspondence rules of quantum theory  , such as the canonical commutation relation  @xmath29=i\\hbar$ ] .",
    "in addition , we obtain the unitarily- and antiunitarily - invariant metric  @xmath30 , and associated measure , over the space of pure states .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro - overview ] by providing a brief overview of the main ideas and the main steps in the derivation .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : f - idealised - set - up ] , we formulate a set of background assumptions and idealizations , and an experimental framework .",
    "the experimental framework precisely delineates which experimental set - ups can be described by the theoretical model that is to be developed . by proceeding in this manner",
    ", we ensure at the outset that there is no ambiguity as to what set of experimental set - ups we are seeking to model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : f - statement - of - postulates ] , we present a set of postulates which determine the theoretical model of a system in the context of this experimental framework .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : overview ] , it is shown how the majority of these postulates can be regarded as reasonable generalizations of elementary experimental facts that are characteristic of quantum phenomena , or are drawn from classical physics , and so can be regarded as a reasonable starting point for a reconstruction of quantum theory .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : d ] , we show how these postulates give rise to the finite - dimensional abstract quantum formalism  ( apart from the form of the temporal evolution operator ) and wigner s result , as well to a metric and measure over the space of pure states .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] with a discussion of the results .    in paper",
    "ii , we formulate an additional principle  ( the _ average - value correspondence principle _ ) , and use this to obtain the form of the temporal evolution operator and to obtain the correspondence rules of quantum theory .",
    "the outline below is presented in four parts .",
    "first , we express the notion of complementarity , which consists of the idea that when a measurement is performed upon a system in some state , the measurement result only yields information about _",
    "half _ of the experimentally - accessible degrees of freedom of the state .",
    "complementarity is expressed by the assertion that , in the case of a measurement that yields @xmath31  possible _ results , _ each result coarse - grains over two objectively - realized _ outcomes _ of the measurement .",
    "the outcomes are assumed to be statistically determined by the state of the system , and are thus characterized by a probability distribution .",
    "the assumed statistical determinism of the outcomes motivates the imposition of the information metric over the space of probability distributions . using these two ideas",
    ", we obtain a formalism in which states of a system are represented by unit vectors in a @xmath32-dimensional real euclidean space , and physical transformations are represented by orthogonal transformations of these vectors .",
    "second , the state is expressed in terms of the probabilities of the measurement results and a set of  @xmath31 real variables ,  @xmath33 .",
    "the assertion that the transformation  @xmath34 is , for any  @xmath35 , is a global gauge transformation of the  @xmath36 implies that the resulting formalism can be expressed in complex form , such that states are represented by @xmath31-dimensional complex vectors , and physical transformations are represented by unitary or antiunitary transformations .",
    "third , it is asserted that any measurement describable by the formalism can be simulated in terms of any given measurement flanked by suitable interactions , which yields the born rule and the hermitian representation of measurements .",
    "fourth , we assume that , in the special case of a system of definite energy in stationary state whose observable degrees of freedom are time - independent , the temporal rate of change of the overall phase of the state is proportional to the energy of the system . in conjunction with the global gauge invariance condition ,",
    "this assumption yields the tensor product rule .",
    "finally , we indicate the further steps that are necessary to derive the explicit form of the temporal evolution operator , and the correspondence rules of quantum theory .",
    "measurement is idealized as a process that ( i )  when performed upon some physical system , yields one of  @xmath31 possible _ results , _ with probabilities ,  @xmath37 , that are determined by the state of the system immediately prior to the measurement , and ( ii )  is reproducible , so that , upon immediate repetition of the measurement , the same result is obtained with certainty .",
    "complementarity is incorporated by assuming that , when measurement  @xmath1 is performed , there are , in fact , @xmath32  possible _ outcomes _ , but these outcomes are not individually observed .",
    "result  @xmath7 is observed  ( @xmath38 ) whenever either outcome  @xmath39 or outcome  @xmath40 is realized  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : prob - tree - complementarity ] ) .",
    "the probabilities of outcomes  @xmath41 are given by  @xmath42 , so that  @xmath43 .",
    "the  @xmath44  ( @xmath45 ) are summarized by the probability @xmath4-tuple  @xmath46 .     _",
    "complementarity postulate_. probability tree showing the outcomes of measurement  @xmath1 , and the corresponding results  ( circled ) that are observed .",
    "one of  @xmath32 possible outcomes are realized , with probability  @xmath47 , respectively . the measurement is unable to resolve the individual outcomes .",
    "result  @xmath7 is obtained whenever either outcome  @xmath39 or outcome  @xmath40 is realized  ( @xmath38).,width=288 ]    intuitively , performing the measurement brings about the realization of one of @xmath32  possible outcomes , but the results of the measurement _ coarse - grain _ over these outcomes :  when outcomes  @xmath39 or  @xmath40 is realized , the measurement is  ( for some reason to be investigated ) unable to resolve the individual outcomes , so that only result  @xmath7 is registered .",
    "once one assumes that measurement outcomes are only statistically determined by the state of the system , it follows that it is impossible in general to determine with certainty whether a given system is in one of two possible states on the basis of the outcomes of a finite number of measurements performed upon identical copies of the system . instead",
    ", only a finite amount of information about which state is present can be obtained .",
    "consequently , as discussed in the introduction , it is natural to endow the space of the  @xmath48 with the information metric , @xmath49 it is convenient to define  @xmath50 , since the metric over the  @xmath51 is then simply the euclidean metric , @xmath52 so that  @xmath53 is a unit vector that lies on the positive orthant of the unit hypersphere ,  @xmath54 , in a @xmath32-dimensional real euclidean space .",
    "next , we consider transformations which represent physical transformations of the system .",
    "we seek one - to - one transformations that preserve the information metric over  @xmath48 , thereby endowing the information metric with a fundamental physical significance .",
    "now , if one takes the  @xmath53 themselves as the state space of the system , one finds that non - trivial one - to - one transformations of the state space that preserve the euclidean metric are not possible . a simple way to allow",
    "the existence of such transformations is to take the entire unit hypersphere ,  @xmath55 , as the state space of the system .",
    "thus , we shall postulate that a state of the system is given by a unit vector  @xmath56 , with  @xmath57 $ ] , and that the probabilities  @xmath44 are given by  @xmath58 . from the information metric over the  @xmath48 , it follows that the metric over the  @xmath53 is euclidean .",
    "hence ,  @xmath53 lies on the unit hypersphere ,  @xmath54 , in a @xmath32-dimensional real euclidean space .",
    "the signs of the  @xmath51 determine in which of the  @xmath59 possible orthants of  @xmath54 that  @xmath53 lies .",
    "we shall refer to the sign of  @xmath51 as the _ polarity _ of outcome  @xmath60 , which is defined only when  @xmath61 , and is physically realized whenever outcome  @xmath60 is realized , but is unobserved .",
    "we postulate that any transformation ,  @xmath62 , of  @xmath55 , that represents a physical transformation of the system is one - to - one and preserves the metric .",
    "it follows that @xmath62  is an orthogonal transformation of  @xmath54 , so that state  @xmath53 is transformed to  @xmath63 , where  @xmath64 is a  @xmath32-dimensional real orthogonal matrix .",
    "we begin by expressing the state ,  @xmath53 , in terms of the probabilities  @xmath65 , and @xmath31  additional real degrees of freedom ,  @xmath66 . in particular",
    ", we postulate that the  @xmath2 and  @xmath36 together determine the  @xmath51 through the relations  @xmath67 and  @xmath68 , where  @xmath69 is not a constant function , and  @xmath69 and  @xmath70 are differentiable functions to be determined .",
    "this change of variables can be understood more directly as follows .",
    "let the outcomes  @xmath71 be relabeled as  @xmath72 , respectively , where the number  @xmath73 indicates the observed result and the letter  ( @xmath74 or  @xmath75 ) indicates which of the two possible outcomes compatible with the observed result was realized .",
    "it then follows from the above assumption that , given result  @xmath7 is observed , the probability that outcome  @xmath76 was realized is  @xmath77 and , similarly , the probability that outcome  @xmath78 was realized is  @xmath79 .",
    "the polarities  ( when defined ) associated with outcomes  @xmath80 and  @xmath81 are given by the signs of  @xmath82 and  @xmath83 , respectively  ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : prob - tree ] ) .",
    "_ state representation postulate_. probability tree showing the outcomes  ( relabeled as  @xmath84 ) of measurement  @xmath1 , redrawn to place results  ( circled ) at the top .",
    "result  @xmath7 is observed with probability  @xmath2 .",
    "given that  @xmath7 is observed , outcome  @xmath76 or  @xmath78 is realized with probability  @xmath85 or  @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "the polarities  ( when defined ) associated with outcomes  @xmath80 and  @xmath81 are given by the signs of  @xmath82 and  @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "the individual outcomes  @xmath80 and  @xmath81 , and their polarities , are unresolved by the measurement.,width=312 ]      on the basis of a classical - quantum correspondence argument , we are led to the assumption that , for the model of a system where the state as represented by  @xmath87 , the transformation  @xmath88 for  @xmath38 is a gauge transformation , and therefore causes no change in the predictions of the model .",
    "from this assumption , we immediately draw two postulates . first , that the measure  @xmath89 , induced by the metric over  @xmath54 is consistent with this global gauge condition , that is  @xmath90 for all  @xmath35 , which we find implies that @xmath91 where  @xmath92 and  @xmath75 are constants , so that @xmath93 where  @xmath94 .",
    "second , we postulate that the result probabilities calculated from state  @xmath63 are unaffected by the above gauge transformation of the  @xmath36 in  @xmath53  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : invariance ] ) .     _ gauge invariance postulate_. along the top , a system in a state represented by  @xmath87 evolves under map  @xmath62 to state represented by  @xmath95 . along the bottom",
    ", a system in a state represented by  @xmath96 evolves under map  @xmath62 to a state represented  @xmath97 .",
    "the postulate asserts that , for any  @xmath35 , one has  @xmath98 for  @xmath38.,width=240 ]    remarkably , one finds that every orthogonal transformation ,  @xmath64 , of  @xmath53 that satisfies this postulate can be rewritten as a unique unitary or antiunitary transformation of @xmath99 conversely , one finds that every unitary or antiunitary transformation of  @xmath100 is equivalent to a unique orthogonal transformation of  @xmath53 which satisfies the global invariance postulate .",
    "that is , the set of all orthogonal transformations of  @xmath54 is in one - to - one correspondence with the set of all unitary and antiunitary transformations of the space of unit vectors  @xmath100 .",
    "hence , any physical transformation of the system in state  @xmath100 can be represented by a unitary or antiunitary transformation of  @xmath100 .",
    "generalizing from the fact that one can simulate any stern - gerlach measurement in terms any given stern - gerlach measurement flanked by suitable magnetic fields , we postulate that any reproducible measurement ,  @xmath101 , describable in the formalism can be simulated by an arrangement  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : representation_of_measurements ] ) where ( a )  an interaction ,  @xmath102 , represented by a unitary transformation ,  @xmath103 , acts on a system in some input state , ( b )  the resulting system undergoes measurement  @xmath1 which produces a measurement result and a system in some outgoing state , and ( c )  some interaction ,  @xmath104 , represented by a unitary transformation ,  @xmath105 , then acts upon the system to generate a system in some output state .",
    "_ measurement simulability postulate_. an arrangement showing measurement  @xmath1 flanked by interactions  @xmath102 and  @xmath104 .",
    "the arrangement simulates measurement  @xmath101 insofar as its measurement probabilities and corresponding possible output states are concerned.,width=326 ]    from the reproducibility of  @xmath1 and  @xmath101 , one immediately obtains the born rule .      on the basis of the above - mentioned classical - quantum correspondence argument ,",
    "we are led to the assumption that the state of a system of definite energy ,  @xmath106 , whose observable degrees of freedom are time - independent , and in a time - independent background , evolves as  @xmath107 during the interval  @xmath108 $ ] , where  @xmath109 is a constant .    using this assumption and the above - mentioned global gauge condition",
    ", we obtain that , if a system consists of two subsystems in states  @xmath87 and  @xmath110 , respectively , where  @xmath38 and  @xmath111 , then the system has state  @xmath112 , where  @xmath113 .",
    "the tensor product rule follows immediately .",
    "in paper  ii , a second classical - quantum correspondence argument is given that leads to the average - value correspondence principle which , in conjunction with the above assumption concerning the temporal evolution of a system , yields the explicit form of the unitary operator ,  @xmath114 , that represents temporal evolution of a system during the interval  @xmath115 $ ] in terms of the hamiltonian operator ,  @xmath116 .",
    "using the average - value correspondence principle , we then obtain the principal correspondence rules of quantum theory .",
    "a model of a physical system is a theoretical structure that allows one to make predictions about the behavior of the system in one of a set of possible experimental arrangements , where an experimental arrangement is abstracted as consisting of a preparation of the system , followed by an interaction and a measurement .",
    "this set of experimental arrangements , which we shall refer to as an _ experimental set _",
    ", is a subset of all conceivable experimental arrangements in which the system could be placed .",
    "since the primary goal of the present work is to illuminate the physical origin of the quantum formalism , it is important to clearly delineate , at the outset , the experimental set to which the theoretical model , to be developed , is intended to apply .",
    "below , we develop an operational procedure to delineate the experimental set , which is based on the following ideas .",
    "consider an experimental arrangement where , in each run , a system  ( taken from a source of identical systems ) undergoes a preparation and an interaction , and is then subject to a measurement .",
    "given that one s goal is to probe the behavior of the system , one ideally wishes to prepare the system in such a way that the data obtained from the measurement is _ independent _ of arbitrary interactions with the system prior to the preparation . in this way",
    ", one ensures that the measurement data are not influenced by conditions which are not under experimental control .",
    "we shall say that experimental set - ups of this kind are _ closed _  ( or have the property of _ closure _ ) , and we shall restrict our consideration to such set - ups . using the concept of closure , we can then give a systematic procedure for generating the set of all closed experimental arrangements which , roughly speaking , probe the same _ behavioral aspect _ of a system as does some given measurement  @xmath1 .",
    "such a set will be said to be an experimental set _ generated _ by measurement  @xmath1 .",
    "for example , any experimental arrangement where silver atoms are subject to preparation by a stern - gerlach device , undergo an interaction with a uniform magnetic field , and finally undergo a stern - gerlach measurement , is closed in the above sense .",
    "furthermore , the set of all such arrangements is an experimental set generated by any given stern - gerlach measurement .",
    "all such set - ups probe the same behavioral aspect of the system , namely its spin behavior .    before we can precisely define closure and give a procedure for generating an experimental set , it is necessary to formulate a number of fundamental background assumptions and idealizations , to which we now turn .",
    "the theoretical framework of classical physics makes the following key background assumptions :    * _ partitioning_. the universe is partitioned into a system , the background environment  ( or simply , the  _ background _ )  the background environment of a systems is , by definition , that part of the environment of a system which non - trivially influences the behavior of the system , but which is not reciprocally affected by the system .",
    "for example , if a planet in the gravitational field of a star is modeled as a test particle in a fixed gravitational field of the star , then the planet  ( test particle ) is the system , and the gravitational field is its background .",
    "if a part of the environment is reciprocally affected by the system , the system is enlarged to include this part of the environment .",
    "for example , if the reciprocal affect of the planet on the star is relevant , the system is enlarged to include the star , and the star and planet are regarded as interacting subsystems within the enlarged system . of the system , measuring apparatuses , and the rest of the universe . *",
    "_ time_. in a given frame of reference , one can speak of a physical time which is common to the system and its background , and which is represented by a real - valued parameter ,  @xmath117 . * _ states . _ at any time , the system is in a definite physical state , whose mathematical description is called the mathematical state , or simply the _ state _ , of the system .",
    "the state space of the system is the set of all possible states of the system .",
    "since these assumptions are not in obvious conflict with quantum phenomena , we adopt them unchanged .",
    "the classical framework also makes two key idealizations concerning measurements :    * _ operational determinism . _",
    "the result of a measurement performed on a system is determined by experimentally - controllable variables . * _ continuum .",
    "_ the values of the possible results of a measurement form a real - valued continuum .",
    "however , the experimental investigation of elementary quantum phenomena , such as stern - gerlach measurements performed on silver atoms , leads to the following reasonable modification of these idealizations :    * _ statistical operational determinism . _",
    "the data obtained when a measurement is performed on a system are best modeled by a probabilistic source   whose probabilities are determined by experimentally - controllable variables . * _ finiteness .",
    "_ a measurement performed on a system has a finite number of possible results .    using these assumptions as a basis , the general abstract experimental set - up that we shall consider",
    "is shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : idealised - set - up ] .",
    "a _ source _ provides identical copies of a physical system of interest . a _ preparation step _ either selects or rejects the incoming system . in a particular run of the experiment ,",
    "a physical system from the source passes the preparation , and is then subject to a _ measurement _ or _",
    "measurements_.    a measurement is idealized as a process that acts upon an _ input _ system , and generates an _ output _ system together with an observed _ result_. the measurement detectors are assumed not to absorb the systems that they detect .",
    "accordingly , a preparation consists of a measurement that determines to which result the incoming system belongs , followed by the selection of the system if the measurement registers a given result , and the rejection of the system otherwise  .",
    "in addition , following the preparation , the system may undergo an _ interaction _ with a physical apparatus .",
    "we shall only consider set - ups which satisfy particular idealizations .",
    "in particular , we shall restrict consideration to measurements that have the following properties :    * _ distinctness . _",
    "the possible results of a measurement have distinct values .",
    "* _ reproducibility .",
    "_ when a measurement is immediately repeated , the same result is observed with certainty . *",
    "_ classicality .",
    "_ the measurements do not involve auxiliary quantum systems .",
    "the distinctness assumption excludes , at this stage , the consideration of measurements where different results can not be observationally distinguished  ) , we show how measurements not satisfying the assumption of distinctness can be theoretically described . ] .",
    "the assumption of reproducibility is drawn from classical physics and is adopted unchanged since it is also a reasonable idealization in many quantum experiments .",
    "finally , the assumption of classicality ensures that the relevant degrees of freedom of the measurement device itself can be treated classically  .",
    "in addition , we shall restrict consideration to interactions that have the following properties :    * _ integrity - preserving . _",
    "the interactions preserve the integrity of the system . * _ reversible and deterministic . _",
    "the interactions are reversible and deterministic at the level of the state of the system , and so can be represented as one - to - one maps over state space .",
    "the integrity - preserving assumption ensures that a theoretical model can follow a system during the interaction .",
    "the reversible and deterministic assumption is drawn from classical physics , and is adopted unchanged .",
    "we shall also assume that the background of the system can be adequately modeled by classical physics insofar as its internal dynamics is concerned .",
    "for example , in the case of a system in a background electromagnetic field , the field is assumed to be modeled classically .",
    "similarly , we shall assume that parameters which determine the measurement being performed  ( the orientation of a stern - gerlach apparatus , for instance ) are described classically as real numbers .",
    "in short , it is assumed that the non - classicality is entirely concentrated in the system and in its interactions with the background and the measurement devices .      from assumptions",
    "a1@xmath118 and  a2@xmath118 , it follows that , in a given experimental set - up , the measurement data obtained in repeated trials are theoretically characterized by a finite set of probabilities .",
    "therefore , the closure condition defined earlier , when applied in the context of these assumptions , requires that these probabilities are independent of the pre - preparation history of the system .",
    "the measurements employed in the abstract set - up are chosen from a _ measurement set _ ,",
    "@xmath119 , which we shall define below .",
    "as mentioned previously , it will be assumed that each measurement has the property of finiteness , which we shall now operationalize by saying that , when the measurement is carried out on a system which has been emitted from the source and has undergone arbitrary interactions thereafter  , the measurement generates one of a finite number of _ possible results _ , a possible result being defined as one that has a non - zero probability of occurrence .",

    "an interaction which is compatible with a measurement set can , similarly , be understood as one that does not allow the behavioral aspect that is being probed to be influenced by degrees of freedom that belong to some other behavioral aspect .",
    "for example , the effect on a silver atom of a uniform magnetic field is only dependent upon the spin degrees of freedom of the system , and is therefore compatible with a measurement set consisting of stern - gerlach measurements .",

    "transparency_. second , a postulate has an additional level of comprehensibility if it can also be traced to well - established experimental facts and physical ideas or principles , a property we shall refer to as _",
    "traceability_.    to illustrate these ideas , consider the example of einstein s postulate that the speed of light emitted by a source is independent of the speed of the source",
    ". the postulate can be transparently understood as a physical assertion in itself .",
    "in addition , the postulate can also be understood as a reasonable inference from the well - established results  ( namely , the constancy of the two - way speed of light ) of the michelson - morley experiment , the generalization from the specific context of the experiment being achieved by an appeal to the general principle of the uniformity of nature .",
    "hence , the postulate is both transparent and traceable .    in our discussion below , we shall organize the postulates into three groups according to their origin :    * * based on experimental observations .",
    "* postulates obtained through direct generalization of experimental facts that are taken to be characteristic of quantum phenomena . * * drawn from classical physics . *",
    "* * postulates adopted unchanged from the theoretical framework of classical physics . * * postulates obtained from classical physics via a classical  quantum correspondence argument . * * novel postulates . * postulates based on novel theoretical principles or ideas which can not obviously be traced to classical physics or to experimental observations .",

    "consider an experiment in which stern - gerlach preparations and measurements are performed upon silver atoms , and where the set  @xmath119 consists of the elements  @xmath135 representing stern - gerlach measurements in the direction  @xmath178 . in this experimental set - up , which is closed in the sense defined earlier",
    ", we find that each measurement yields one of two possible results .",

    "postulate  1.2 can be regarded as direct generalization of this observation .      a classical model of a physical system",
    "is based upon the _ partitioning _ , _ time _ and _ states _ background assumptions given earlier , and these are adopted unchanged in the abstract quantum model .",
    "in addition to the assumptions  @xmath182 and  @xmath183 concerning measurements given earlier , the classical model additionally makes the following key assumptions :    1 .",
    "_ * _ determinism .",
    "_ the state of the system and a theoretical description of a measurement that is performed on the system determine the measurement result .",
    "_ * _ mappings .",
    "_ physical transformations of the system , either due to temporal evolution or due to a passive change of frame of reference , are represented by maps over the space of states .",
    "* _ one - to - one .",
    "_ the mappings are one - to - one . * _ continuity . _",
    "if a map represents a physical transformation that depends continuously upon a real - valued set of parameters , then the map is continuously dependent upon these parameters .",
    "* _ continuous transformations . _",
    "if a map represents a continuous transformation  ( such as temporal evolution ) that depends continuously upon a set of real - valued parameters , then , for some value of these parameters , the map reduces to the identity .",
    "we remark that , in asserting  c1c2 , it is presupposed that physical transformations of a physical system are deterministic and reversible , which prevents the description of irreversible or indeterministic transformations within the classical framework at a fundamental level .",
    "first , we consider those postulates which adopt classical assumptions unchanged . the mappings and one - to - one postulates respectively correspond to assumptions  c1 and  c2 , while the continuity and continuous transformations postulates correspond to assumptions  c3 and  c4 , respectively .",
    "second , as described earlier , in light of the results of experiments involving quantum systems  ( such as stern - gerlach measurements on silver atoms ) , it is reasonable to modify assumptions  a1 ,  a2 to assumptions  a1@xmath118 and  a2@xmath118  ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : f - idealised - set - up ] ) , and accordingly to modify  b1 as follows :    * _ statistical determinism .",
    "_ the state of the system and a theoretical description of a measurement that is performed on the system only _ statistically _ determine the measurement result .",
    "assumption  b1@xmath118 is incorporated within the complementarity postulate .",
    "a general guiding principle in building up a quantum model of a physical system is that , in an appropriate limit , the predictions of the quantum model of the system stand in some one - to - one correspondence with those of a classical model of the system . by establishing such a correspondence between the quantum and classical models of a particle , we shall transpose two elementary properties of the classical model across to the quantum model and then , by generalization , transpose these properties across to the abstract quantum model ,  @xmath169 . in this manner ,",
    "we shall obtain a number of important postulates .",
    "the key idea , explicated in detail below , is that a quantum model of a particle moving in one dimension corresponds , in the appropriate classical limit , to the classical ensemble model of the particle , namely the hamilton - jacobi ensemble model .",
    "we consider coarse position measurements , and discretize the hamilton - jacobi state  @xmath184 , where  @xmath185 is the probability density function over position and  @xmath186 is the action function , as  @xmath187 , where  @xmath188 is the probability that the position measurement yields result  @xmath7  ( @xmath189 , and  @xmath190 is the action associated with position  @xmath7 . on the assumption that the quantum state can be put into one - to - one correspondence with the classical state in the classical limit , it follows that the quantum state of the particle must be of the form  @xmath87 , where , again , the  @xmath2 are the probabilities of the position measurement , and where the  @xmath36 are @xmath31  real degrees of freedom . in the limit ,",
    "we assume  @xmath191 and  @xmath192 , where  @xmath168 has the dimensions of action .",
    "using this correspondence , we can transpose elementary features of the hamilton - jacobi model across to the quantum model of the particle .",
    "two properties will be of importance , to which we shall refer as _ global gauge invariance _ and _ temporal evolution_.    the first property arises from the fact that the transformation  @xmath193 , where  @xmath194 is an arbitrary real number , is a global gauge transformation , which therefore leaves the predictions of the classical model invariant .",
    "this leads to the assumption that , in the quantum model of the particle , the transformation  @xmath195 is also a global gauge transformation .",
    "we then generalize by assuming that this also holds of the abstract quantum model ,  @xmath169 .",
    "this global gauge invariance condition leads to two postulates .",
    "first , from the global gauge invariance condition , it follows that , in particular , the map ,  @xmath62 , representing physical transformation of a system described using model  @xmath169 , which takes the state  @xmath87 to  @xmath95 , is such that the  @xmath196 are invariant under the transformation  @xmath195 for any  @xmath35 .",
    "this is the content of the gauge invariance postulate , and can be seen to impose a constraint upon  @xmath62 .",
    "second , we require that the measure ,  @xmath157 , induced by the metric over state space is consistent with the global gauge transformation , so that  @xmath197 for any  @xmath35 , which is the content of the measure invariance postulate , and imposes a constraint upon the functions  @xmath69 and  @xmath70 .    the second property arises by considering the special case of a classical ensemble in a time - independent background with state  @xmath198 , whose observable degrees of freedom  ( namely the  @xmath188 and the  @xmath199 , with  @xmath200 ) are time - independent . in this case",
    ", the state evolves in time  @xmath201 to  @xmath202 , where  @xmath106 is the total energy of the system .",
    "that is , in this particular case , the temporal rate of change of the  @xmath190 encodes the energy of the system . using the correspondence  @xmath192",
    ", we assume that , for a system described within the model  @xmath169 in a time - independent background , and in a state ( i )  whose observable degrees of freedom are time - independent , and ( ii )  which is of definite energy  @xmath106 , the temporal rate of change of the  @xmath36 is  @xmath203 .",
    "this constitutes the temporal evolution postulate .    from the global gauge invariance condition and the temporal evolution postulate ,",
    "we obtain a further postulate concerning composite systems we consider a composite system consisting of two subsystems and require that ( a )  a global gauge transformation on either subsystem leads only to a global gauge transformation on the composite system , and ( b )  in the case where the observable degrees of freedom of both subsystems are time - independent , the subsystems are in states of definite energy  @xmath106 and  @xmath204 , respectively , and their environment is time - independent , the energy of the composite system is  @xmath205 .",
    "from these two ideas , we obtain the composite systems postulate .",
    "consider an experiment in which a position measurement is used to prepare a particle at time  @xmath206 , and a position measurement is subsequently performed at time  @xmath207 , during which interval a potential  @xmath208 is assumed to act .",
    "when such an experiment is actually performed , one necessarily uses position measurements with a finite number of possible measurement results . in this case , the experimental results  ( where , for instance , an electron passes through a sub - micron aperture , is subject to electric - field interactions , and is subsequently detected on a screen ) support the conclusion that , if these coarse position measurements are of sufficiently high spatial resolution , the preparation is , to a very good approximation , complete with respect to the subsequent measurement .",
    "suppose , then , that a coarse position measurement with  @xmath31 possible results is used to implement both the preparation and measurement steps , and further let us suppose that the coarse measurement is such that the probability that a detection is obtained in any run of the experiment is very close to unity . further , let us suppose that the coarse measurement is of sufficient resolution that the preparation can be regarded as being complete with respect to the measurement . then we can form a quantum model , which we shall denote  @xmath209 , within the framework of the abstract quantum model  @xmath169 , which approximately describes the experiment after time  @xmath206 .    by the results",
    "postulate and the assumption  b1@xmath118 above , the state ,  @xmath210 , of the system immediately prior to the coarse position measurement determines the probability n - tuple ,  @xmath211 , where  @xmath2 is the probability of detection at the @xmath7th detector , which characterizes the data obtained from the coarse position measurement .    if the above experiment is repeated , except that the coarse position measurement is delayed until time  @xmath212 , then  @xmath210 , together with a theoretical representation of any interaction in the interval  @xmath213 $ ] , must  ( by assumption  b1@xmath118 ) enable the prediction of the probability n - tuple  @xmath214 that describes the coarse position measurement data obtained at time  @xmath212 . to determine what additional degrees of freedom",
    "the state  @xmath210 must contain in order to make this prediction possible , consider the classical limit .",
    "suppose that  @xmath215 is increased towards values characteristic of macroscopic bodies . under the assumption made above , the preparation is complete with respect to the measurement , so that the system continues to be well - described by the model  @xmath169 even in this classical limit .",
    "however , as  @xmath215 tends towards macroscopic values , it is reasonable to expect that the system will increasingly behave in accordance with its classical model between times  @xmath207 and  @xmath212 .",
    "that is , in this classical limit , we expect that  @xmath214 , which is determined in the quantum model in terms of  @xmath216 and the other degrees of freedom in  @xmath210 , will coincide with the n - tuple  @xmath217 that is predicted by a classical model of a particle of mass  @xmath215 moving in the same potential .    the relevant classical model in this situation is a particle ensemble model .",
    "for such an ensemble model , one can choose to describe an ensemble for the case of given total energy by means of a probability density function over phase space , and to describe the evolution of this function using newton s equations of motion .",
    "alternatively , one can employ the hamilton - jacobi model , which is physically equivalent .",
    "we choose the latter since it is more easily described on a discrete spatial lattice .    in the hamilton - jacobi model ,",
    "the state of the ensemble is given by  @xmath218 , which satisfies the hamilton - jacobi equations , @xmath219 where  @xmath185 is the probability density function over position and  @xmath186 is the action function . in the case of coarse position measurements with  @xmath31 possible results",
    ", we shall use the discretized form of the hamilton - jacobi state ,  @xmath220 , where  @xmath188 is the probability that the position measurement yields a detection at the  @xmath7th measurement location , and  @xmath190 is the classical action at the  @xmath7th measurement location .    in order that the predictions of the quantum and classical models agree in the classical limit , the quantum state  @xmath221  ( @xmath222 ) must contain degrees of freedom which encode  @xmath31 quantities , which we shall denote  @xmath223 , which , in the classical limit , are equal to the  @xmath190 .",
    "equivalently , we shall assume that  @xmath145 contains  @xmath31 dimensionless real quantities ,  @xmath33 , such that  @xmath224 , where  @xmath168 is a non - zero constant with the dimensions of action .    from the above discussion , in the model  @xmath209 , the state ,  @xmath145 ,",
    "is given by  @xmath149 , where  @xmath225 .",
    "a direct generalization of this observation leads to the assumption that the state of a system described by the abstract model  @xmath169 with respect to some measurement  @xmath1 can be represented by  @xmath149 .",
    "as will be discussed below , this assumption provides the motivation for the state representation postulate .      in the continuum hamilton - jacobi model ,",

    "therefore , the discretized form of the model has a global gauge invariance property , namely that , for a system with state  @xmath231 , the transformation  @xmath232 for  @xmath38 and for any  @xmath194 is a global gauge transformation , leaving invariant all physical predictions made on the basis of the state .    from this property of the hamilton - jacobi model , using the above classical - quantum correspondence , we assume , in the quantum model of a particle , and , even more generally for the abstract quantum model  @xmath169 , the transformation @xmath233 where  @xmath234 , is also a gauge transformation . from this assumption ,",
    "we now shall draw two postulates .",
    "first , we note that , as a direct result of this global gauge invariance assumption , it follows that a transformation  ( representing passive or active physical transformation of the system ) of the state  @xmath235 to the state  @xmath95 is such that the  @xmath236 are unchanged if an arbitrary real constant ,  @xmath35 , is added to each of the  @xmath36 .",
    "this is the content of the gauge invariance postulate , which may be regarded as a specific example of the assumed global gauge invariance property .",
    "second , we impose the requirement that the measure  ( or , in the language of bayesian probability theory , the _ prior _ ) over  @xmath237 induced by the metric over state space  ( which metric arises from the information metric postulate ) is compatible with the global gauge invariance property , and therefore satisfies the relation @xmath238 for any  @xmath35 , which is the content of the measure invariance postulate .",
    "the requirement of the consistency of the measure with the global gauge invariance property can be understood as follows .",
    "suppose that one is performing bayesian inference on the quantum system .",
    "if one s knowledge about the quantum system includes the fact that it has a global gauge invariance property , then the prior over the  @xmath2 and  @xmath36 which one employs should reflect this fact .",
    "otherwise , one s inference will sometimes lead to predictions that are not consistent with the global gauge invariance property .",
    "consider the special case of a system in a time - independent background whose observable degrees of freedom are time - independent .",
    "according to the hamilton - jacobi equations , the state of such a system evolves in time  @xmath201 as @xmath239 where  @xmath106 is the energy of the ensemble .",
    "that is , the temporal rate of change of the unobservable degree of freedom encodes the total energy of the system .    using the above classical - quantum correspondence",
    ", we assume that the quantum model of a particle in a time - independent background which is in a state of definite energy with time - independent observable degrees of freedom , evolves as  @xmath240 during the interval  @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "the temporal postulate directly transposes this assumption to the quantum model  @xmath169 .",
    "let us consider a composite system , described in the model  @xmath241 , consisting of two subsystems that are known to be in states represented by  @xmath87 and  @xmath242 , respectively , with  @xmath38 and  @xmath111 , and  @xmath243 .",
    "the composite system is in a state represented by  @xmath244 , where  @xmath113 , and we assume that    @xmath245    where  @xmath246 is a function , symmetric in its arguments , to be determined .",
    "suppose that the first subsystem undergoes the gauge transformation  @xmath195 .",
    "we require that this transformation leads to a gauge transformation of the composite system , so that @xmath247 where  @xmath248 is some function to be determined . together with eq .",
    ", this implies that  @xmath246 is linear in its first argument .",
    "applying the same argument to the second subsystem , one obtains that  @xmath249 .",
    "imposing symmetry , and setting  @xmath250 without loss of generality , we obtain  @xmath251 .",
    "to determine  @xmath252 , we apply the temporal evolution postulate .",
    "we require that , if the energies of the subsystems are  @xmath106 and  @xmath204 , respectively , the energy of the composite system is  @xmath253 . from the temporal evolution postulate , it follows at once that  @xmath254 .",
    "hence , we obtain  @xmath255 . therefore , the state of the composite system  @xmath256 , which is the content of the composite systems postulate .",
    "alternatively , one can obtain this result more directly from the hamilton - jacobi model .",
    "we note that , if , with respect to position measurements along the  @xmath257 and  @xmath258 axes , the discretized hamilton - jacobi state of a particle is  @xmath259 and  @xmath260 , respectively , where  @xmath38 and  @xmath111 , then , with respect to @xmath261-position measurements , its state is  @xmath262 where  @xmath263 . by the classical - quantum correspondence , and then generalizing to the abstract quantum model ,  @xmath169 , we obtain the same result .        according to the discussion of correspondence above , the state  @xmath264 , written with respect to some measurement  @xmath141 , can be represented by the pair  @xmath149 , where  @xmath127 contains the probabilities of the measurement results , and  @xmath265 is an ordered set of real - valued degrees of freedom . hence , the state consists of a mixture of probabilities and degrees of freedom unconnected to probabilities , and measurement  @xmath1 yields information about the  @xmath2 but not the  @xmath36 .",
    "the complementarity postulate is motivated by the aesthetic desideratum the the quantum state , as far as possible , should consist of probabilities of events rather than being such a mixture , and aims to express the restriction on measurement  @xmath1 as a restriction on the ability of measurement  @xmath1 to completely resolve the events that occur when it is performed .",
    "in particular , we hypothesize that , when measurement  @xmath1 is performed , there are , in fact , @xmath32  possible outcomes , with respective probabilities  @xmath42 , and that result  @xmath7 is observed whenever either outcome  @xmath39 or outcome  @xmath40 is realized .",
    "we note that similar assumptions have been made in toy models of quantum theory in order to give concrete expression to complementarity  @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion - of - postulate-2 - 2 ] , we sketch some ideas which help to provide a better physical understanding of this postulate .",
    "the states postulate asserts that the state of a system with respect to measurement  @xmath141 is given by  @xmath266 , with  @xmath147 $ ] , where  @xmath58 .",
    "hence , in addition to the  @xmath44 , this postulate asserts that there is an additional , binary degree of freedom ,  @xmath267 , associated with each outcome  @xmath60 , where  @xmath148 , which is defined whenever  @xmath61 .",
    "the motivation for the introduction of the  @xmath267 is the following .",
    "if one takes the  @xmath48 themselves as the state space of the system , one finds that non - trivial one - to - one transformations of the state space that preserve the metric over the state space  ( as we shall require in the metric preservation postulate , described below ) are not possible . a simple way to allow",
    "the existence of such transformations is to take all  @xmath53 as the state space of the system , for then there exist transformations , such as orthogonal transformations of the  @xmath53 , which preserve the metric over the  @xmath53 .",
    "the state representation postulate connects together the hypothesis , expressed by the states postulate , that the state of a system is given by  @xmath268 and the above assertion that the state can be represented by  @xmath149 .",
    "specifically , labeling the  @xmath32 possible outcomes of measurement  @xmath1 as  @xmath269 , we can redraw the probability tree of fig .",
    "[ fig : prob - tree - complementarity ] as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prob - tree ] , where the results  @xmath270 of the measurement are shown in the upper level of the tree .",
    "if result  @xmath7 is observed , the experimenter does not know whether outcome  @xmath80 or  @xmath81 was realized , or what were their polarities .",
    "the probability that  @xmath80 was realized given that result  @xmath7 was obtained is denoted  @xmath271 , and similarly the probability that  @xmath81 was realized given result  @xmath7 is denoted  @xmath272 .",
    "we can encode these probabilities and polarities into the quantities  @xmath273 and  @xmath274 by requiring that  @xmath275 and  @xmath276 , and that the polarities  @xmath277 and  @xmath278 , the polarities being defined whenever the corresponding probabilities are non - zero .",
    "the state representation postulate now connects the  @xmath273 and  @xmath274 together with the  @xmath36 by asserting that @xmath279 where  @xmath69 is not a constant function , and where the functions  @xmath69 and  @xmath70 are function , assumed differentiable , to be determined .",
    "the information metric postulate asserts that the metric over the space of probability distributions  @xmath48 is the information metric which , as discussed in the introduction , naturally arises if one considers questions of information gain .",
    "the metric preservation postulate accords the metric over state space a fundamental place in the theoretical framework :  any transformation of state space is required to preserve the distance between any pair of nearby states .",
    "this idea is similar to the premise of wigner s theorem , namely that transformations of the space of pure states of a quantum system preserve the hilbert space angle between any two pure states , which can be interpreted as requiring that transformations preserve the distinguishability of any pair of states  @xcite .",
    "the derivation will proceed as follows .",
    "first , in sec .  [ sec : d1 ] , using the states and information metric postulates , we represent the state of a system ,  @xmath221 , as a unit vector in a @xmath32-dimensional real euclidean space ,  @xmath280 , and use two of the transformations postulates  ( mappings and one - to - one ) to find that transformations over state space are orthogonal transformations .",

    "third , in sec .  [ sec : d4 ] , we draw upon the measurement simulability postulate in order to obtain a representation of measurements on a system , and , in sec .

    "however , the validity and meaning of the energy - time uncertainty relation , and of the inferences that can legitimately drawn from it , have been , and continue to be , the subject of debate  ( see , for example , ref .",

    "the exploration of these tentative suggestions remains for future work .",
    "one of the major objectives of the program of deriving quantum theory using the concept of information is to determine whether the concept of information is indispensable to our understanding of the quantum formalism , and , if so , to illuminate the precise relationship between the concept of information and the quantum formalism .    on the first issue , although many recent approaches to derive the quantum formalism involve the concept of information , the conclusion that information is indispensable to our understanding of the quantum formalism can not be drawn , either because the approaches are unable to obtain the quantum formalism  ( even though they are able to derive specific results , such as malus law ) , or because , in those approaches that are able to obtain a significant fraction of the quantum formalism , the abstract nature of some of the assumptions that are employed obscures the role played by information in determining the formalism .",
    "indeed , further doubt on the need for information is cast by other recent approaches , most notably due to hardy  @xcite , that are successful in deriving a significant fraction of the quantum formalism without explicitly invoking the concept of information .",
    "the formulation presented here provides significant new insight into this issue .",
    "the formulation rests on assumptions that are transparent and that are , to a large extent , traceable to familiar or well - established experimental facts or theoretical idea , so that , for example , abstract assumptions that directly introduce complex numbers are avoided .",
    "consequently , the role played by information in the derivation can be clearly seen .",
    "furthermore , one can see that its role is sufficiently widespread that it seems very likely that the concept of information could indeed have a fundamental role to play in our understanding of the origin of the quantum formalism .    on the second issue",
    ", owing to the transparency of the assumptions that form the basis of the derivation , it is apparent from the derivation that the concept of information , via the information metric , plays a substantial role in giving rise to various structural features of the quantum formalism .",
    "first , we have seen that , if the space of probability distributions is endowed with the information metric , a transformation to the space where the distributions are parameterized by the square - roots of probability is endowed with a euclidean metric",
    ". hence , even at the level of classical probability theory , it appears , just as one sees in the quantum formalism , that the square - roots of probability have a rather fundamental significance    second , once a quantum state is represented as a unit vector , @xmath540 , in a @xmath32-dimension real euclidean space , the imposition that the measure over  @xmath36 is flat  ( which follows from the requirement that the measure induced by the metric over the  @xmath53 is consistent with the global gauge condition ) leads immediately to the functions  @xmath541 and  @xmath542 .",
    "hence , the sinusoidal functions into which the phases ,  @xmath543 , in a quantum state ,  @xmath544 , enter can be directly traced to the concept of information .",
    "third , the requirement that transformations of the state space preserve the metric leads to the conclusion that the transformations must be orthogonal . as we have shown , it is then only necessary to impose the gauge invariance postulate to restrict the set of allowed transformations to a subset of the orthogonal transformations in order to obtain a one - to - one correspondence between the allowed transformations and the set of unitary and antiunitary transformations of a complex vector space .",
    "the derivation provides a number of significant insights into the quantum formalism , of which we mention only a few .",
    "first , we note that , since the development of the quantum formalism , there has been some uncertainty as to whether the formalism is the most general formalism for the description of quantum phenomena in flat space - time .",
    "various possibilities have been suggested for the generalization of the formalism which , from a purely mathematical point of view , seem to be plausible , and which may have interesting physical consequences . for example , the possibility of non - unitary temporal evolution has been considered by several authors  @xcite .",
    "the derivation given above gives rise to a mathematical structure that is neither more nor less general than the finite - dimensional abstract quantum formalism , and thereby lends support to the view that the quantum formalism is the most general formalism for the description of quantum phenomena in flat space - time .",
    "constructively , the formulation has the potential to allow one to explicitly work out the effect that specific changes to particular postulates would have upon the quantum formalism .",
    "for example , if one wishes to modify the quantum formalism so as to allow continuous transformations to be represented by non - unitary transformations , one could identify which postulates could be plausibly modified  ( in the present example , the gauge invariance postulate would seem to be the obvious candidate ) , and explicitly follow through the changes in the formalism that result .",
    "the second insight is based on the fact that antiunitary transformations are not generally regarded as an integral part of the abstract quantum formalism  ( as formalized , for instance , by dirac or von neumann ) , but are instead usually introduced by reference to the theorem of wigner mentioned in the introduction .",
    "since this theorem rests on particular assumptions , this raises the question as to whether antiunitary transformations are as fundamental as unitary transformations .",
    "however , since unitary and antiunitary transformations emerge on an equal footing in the derivation presented above , the derivation suggests that antiunitary transformations are an equally fundamental part of the quantum formalism .",
    "third , the prevalence of complex numbers in the quantum formalism is perhaps its most mysterious mathematical features .",
    "the emergence of complex numbers in the derivation depends on most of the postulates , and so is not easy to unravel , but the role of the global gauge invariance condition is perhaps the most obvious :  prior to the imposition of the two postulates based on this condition  ( namely , the gauge invariance and the measure invariance postulates ) , the state space is  @xmath54 in a @xmath32-dimensional real space , and the set of all possible transformations is the set of orthogonal transformations .",
    "however , these two postulate restrict the set of all possible transformations of  @xmath280 to a subset of the orthogonal transformations , and thereby allows the set of all possible transformations to be represented by the set of all unitary and antiunitary transformations of a suitably defined complex vector space . hence , from this perspective , it appears that the use of complex numbers in the quantum formalism is directly tied to the set of possible transformations of state space , and is critically dependent upon the global gauge invariance condition .",
    "fourth , we have seen that the quantum formalism can be represented in a real form , where a pure state is represented by a unit vector on the unit hypersphere in a real @xmath32-dimensional space , and where allowed transformations are a subset of the set of orthogonal transformations of the unit sphere .",
    "such a simple , easy visualizable representation , which does not appear widely known , may prove useful in certain contexts .",
    "for example , in this representation , one can immediately see that a uniform measure over the unit hypersphere ,  @xmath54 , is invariant under all orthogonal transformations , and is therefore unitarily - invariant .",
    "fifth , it has been suggested  @xcite that the quantum formalism may owe at least a significant part of its structure to the fact that quantum theory permits non - locality and no - signaling to peacefully coexist , and a number of recent reconstructive approaches  @xcite rely upon postulates that concern the behavior of physically separated sub - systems to arrive at the key mathematical features of the quantum formalism .",
    "however , the above derivation suggests that such considerations are not essential to the development of a physical understanding of the core of quantum formalism .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that the finite - dimensional abstract quantum formalism  ( apart from the explicit form of the temporal evolution operator ) can be derived within the framework of information geometry using features of quantum phenomena which can be physically understood by reference to experimental observations and general theoretical principles .",
    "the derivation illuminates the physical origin of the quantum formalism , suggests that information plays a key role in giving rise to the quantum formalism , and potentially has significant implications for the interpretation and proposed modifications of quantum theory .",

    "i would like to thank the cavendish laboratory ; trinity college , cambridge ; wolfson college , cambridge ; and perimeter institute for institutional and financial support .",

    "<S> in this paper and a companion paper , we show how the framework of information geometry , a geometry of discrete probability distributions , can form the basis of a derivation of the quantum formalism . </S>",
    "<S> the derivation rests upon a few elementary features of quantum phenomena , such as the statistical nature of measurements , complementarity , and global gauge invariance . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that these features can be traced to experimental observations characteristic of quantum phenomena and to general theoretical principles , and thus can reasonably be taken as a starting point of the derivation . </S>",
    "<S> when appropriately formulated within an information geometric framework , these features lead to  ( i )  the abstract quantum formalism for finite - dimensional quantum systems , ( ii )  the result of wigner s theorem , and  ( iii )  the fundamental correspondence rules of quantum theory , such as the canonical commutation relationships . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism also comes naturally equipped with a metric  ( and associated measure ) over the space of pure states which is unitarily- and anti - unitarily invariant . </S>",
    "<S> the derivation suggests that the information geometric framework is directly or indirectly responsible for many of the central structural features of the quantum formalism , such as the importance of square - roots of probability and the occurrence of sinusoidal functions of phases in a pure quantum state . </S>",
