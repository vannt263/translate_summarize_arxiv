    "the sufficiency is essentially the same as in @xcite by using topological arguments , we sketch the main idea here . if @xmath40 is not totally disconnected , so is the self - similar set @xmath0 by theorem [ th - holder - equ ] . then there is a connected component @xmath470 contains more that one point .",
    "note that for any @xmath471 , @xmath472 where @xmath473 .",
    "let @xmath474 .",
    "if @xmath475 , then it is a relatively open set in @xmath272 , and as @xmath272 is connected , @xmath476 ( @xmath477 means the relative boundary of @xmath478 in @xmath272 ) . let @xmath479 be in the intersection , there exists @xmath480 such that @xmath481 and @xmath482 .",
    "inductively , if @xmath483 does not cover @xmath272 , then we can repeat the same procedure to find @xmath484 such that @xmath485 since @xmath472 , this process must end at some step , say @xmath486 , and in this case @xmath487 . since the diameter @xmath488 as @xmath489",
    ", @xmath486 must tend to infinity , which contracts the uniform boundedness of the horizontal components on the levels @xmath140 .",
    "for the necessity , let @xmath432 be a sequence of horizontal components satisfying @xmath490 .",

    "the similar argument can also be used to show the second part without making many changes .",
    "in @xcite , we observed that if the incidence matrix @xmath50 of an augmented tree is primitive , then @xmath279 is rearrangeable for some @xmath281 , by using this , we obtained a stronger but simpler result ( theorem 1.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , we do not know if the observation is still true for the generalized rearrangeable matrix of this paper .",
    "so we ask      later in @xcite , for the equicontractive ifs with the osc , by some modification , we removed the primitive ( or rearrangeable ) assumption on the incidence matrix .",
    "so for the the ifs with non - equal contraction ratios and overlaps , we wonder      on the other hand , a more general augmented tree was introduced by lau and wang @xcite , which is defined on a tree ( independent of the ifs ) with an associated set - valued map .",
    "they proved that such augmented tree is hyperbolic and any compact set in @xmath357 can be hlder equivalent to the hyperbolic boundary of certain augmented tree .",
    "hence more flexible iterated schemes can also be fit into the framework . as for the application to lipschitz equivalence , by using the method of this paper , it is still interesting to carry out a similar study on moran sets or more general fractals .",
