    "the thermodynamic properties of itinerant fermionic systems is a subject of long - standing experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite interest .",
    "it is generally accepted @xcite that the low - temperature behavior of a wide class of interacting fermionic systems is controlled by the fermi - liquid fixed point .",
    "this implies that the leading temperature dependences are the same as for free fermions , but with renormalized parameters .",
    "however , the first subleading corrections may differ qualitatively from those of non - interacting fermions .",
    "this phenomenon was first noticed in the context of the specific heat coefficient , @xmath3 . for non - interacting fermions , @xmath4 has a regular expansion in powers of @xmath5 about @xmath6 , so the leading temperature dependence is @xmath7 . for interacting fermions",
    ", @xmath4 is not an analytic function of @xmath5 ; the leading temperature dependence is instead proportional to @xmath8 in three dimensions ( 3d ) and @xmath9 in 2d the @xmath10 term was first found by eliashberg in a theoretical study of electrons interacting with acoustic phonons @xcite , and the possibility of a nonanalytic temperature dependence of @xmath2 was subsequently ( but apparently independently ) inferred from measurements of @xmath11 for @xmath12he by abel , wheately and andersen @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13he measurements led to a large literature   @xcite which we review in detail below .",
    "we note here a few crucial ( and seemingly contradictory ) results . _",
    "( i ) _ in a very important paper @xcite , pethick and carneiro showed that for a 3d fermi liquid the @xmath14 term in @xmath2 was a fermi - liquid effect , associated with a combination of the multiple scattering of particle - hole pairs with small total momentum and a particular behavior of the quasiparticle interaction function @xmath15 ( also at small @xmath16 ) . _ ( ii ) _ more recently , it has been demonstrated  @xcite that in 2d , the prefactor of the @xmath9 term in @xmath17 is determined entirely by the squares of charge and spin components of the _ backscattering _ amplitude .",
    "[ by `` backscattering '' we mean scattering of fermions with almost opposite momenta . transferred momentum can be either small or near @xmath18 $ ] on the other hand the previous 3d work @xcite found no special role of backscattering for the @xmath10 nonanalyticity . _",
    "( iii ) _ the older work left the impression that in 3d the nonanalyticities were particular to @xmath2 and did not contribute to susceptibilities , whereas more recent work ( based mainly on perturbative calculations ) has demonstrated that nonanalytic corrections to the spin susceptibility occur both in 3d @xcite and in 2d @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we clarify the relation between nonanalyticities in @xmath11 for 3d and 2d systems and make a few remarks concerning the relation between the nonanalyticities in @xmath2 and those in susceptibilities .",
    "we demonstrate that backscattering plays a special role also in 3d , in the sense that a part of the @xmath19 term comes entirely from backscattering .",
    "this backscattering contribution evolves smoothly between 2d and 3d , and is entirely responsible for the nonanalytic part of @xmath11 for @xmath20 . in @xmath21 , however , there exists another , physically distinct , contribution to the @xmath10 term in @xmath11 .",
    "this contribution does not occur for @xmath20 and is not expressible solely in terms of the backscattering amplitude .",
    "we argue that this contribution is important for the 3d spin susceptibility as well .",
    "we also clarify the relation between the expressions for the prefactor of the @xmath10 term via the forward - scattering interaction in the pethick - carneiro approach ( and in subsequent analyses based on bosonization @xcite ) and via the backscattering amplitude .",
    "in particular , pethick and carnerio expressed the nonanalyticities in terms of the small @xmath16 form of the scattering amplitude @xmath22 for momenta slightly displaced from the fermi surface . as we will demonstrate explicitly",
    ", their result can be re - expressed in terms of a dynamical interaction between quasiparticles at the fermi surface , in which backscattering plays a crucial role . at the same time , we show , in disagreement with  refs .",
    "@xcite that processes involving forward - scattering between quasiparticles at the fermi surface do not contribute to the nonanalyticity in @xmath2 although forward scattering does make a nonanalytic contribution to the self energy .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we outline the qualitative physics underlying the results presented here . in section iii , we present the formalism and introduce forward - scattering and backscattering amplitudes . sections iv and v give detailed calculations of the nonanalyticity in the entropy for the cases of three and two spatial dimensions , respectively .",
    "section vi presents presents a brief discussion of the spin susceptibility .",
    "section vii explicates the relation of our results to previous calculations of the self - energy , and section viii compares our results for the entropy to those obtained in prior work .",
    "section ix presents a brief comparison of our results to the specific heat data for @xmath12he .",
    "section x presents summary and conclusions .",
    "an explicit calculation of the @xmath23 contribution to the nonanalyticity in the specific heat is presented in appendix a.",
    "in this section we present a qualitative discussion of the physics underpinning our key results .",
    "subsequent sections provide the formal justification . to compute the low-@xmath9 specific heat of a fermi liquid ,",
    "one expands the thermodynamic potential ( @xmath24 ) in the number of particle - hole pairs excited above the fermi - liquid ground state .",
    "each excited quasiparticle interacts with the corresponding excited quasihole and with other particle - hole pairs via interaction vertices , @xmath25 .",
    "some low order diagrams are shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : omegas ] .",
    "= 1.0    to obtain the entropy @xmath26 we must average over all excited particle - hole pairs , weighting the contributions by the derivative of the bose distribution function @xmath27 which is odd in @xmath28 and , at low temperature @xmath9 ensures that all excited electrons are near the fermi surface .",
    "the contributions also involve the spectral function of the quasiparticle - quasihole pairs [ the imaginary part of the particle - hole propagator @xmath29 , which is also odd in @xmath28 , and , critically , is not an analytic function of @xmath28 .",
    "for example , in @xmath30 , @xmath31 with @xmath32 the step function .",
    "therefore , only states with an odd number of excited pairs contribute to the entropy , and thus to @xmath33 .",
    "the leading term has only one excited particle - hole pair ( diagram 1a in fig.[fig : omegas ] ) and for momentum - independent interaction @xmath34 yields for the interaction - dependent part of the entropy @xmath35 the momentum integral in eq [ [ sexample ] ] is dominated by large @xmath36 , and so yields a constant , whereas the frequency integral yields @xmath37 , i.e. , @xmath38const .",
    "this is the leading fermi - liquid result .",
    "the subleading terms contain contributions from three , five , etc thermally excited particle - hole pairs .",
    "for thermally allowed excitations @xmath39 , so each extra particle - hole pair brings an extra factor of @xmath9 to the thermodynamic potential .",
    "one might therefore expect an expansion of the form @xmath40 however , the non - analytic behavior of the particle - hole spectral function implies that this conclusion is not correct .",
    "the non - analyticity enters in two ways .",
    "first , processes involving three pairs with the same total momentum @xmath16 ( see , e.g. , diagram 3c of fig.[fig : omegas ] ) contain the cube of the spectral function , so give a term proportional to @xmath41 ; the integral over @xmath16 leads to a logarithmic divergence cut off at @xmath42 , and hence , in 3d , to a @xmath43 contribution @xmath44 .",
    "second , the general form of the interaction vertex @xmath25 has a term of order @xmath45 arising from the kramers - kronig transform of im@xmath46 which , in combination with the @xmath47 from a single excited particle - hole pair , produces in @xmath48 an additional @xmath43 contribution to @xmath44 ( see , e.g. , diagram @xmath49 in fig .",
    "[ fig : omegas ] ) .",
    "note that dimension @xmath30 is marginal in the sense that only for @xmath50 the leading nonanalytic term is larger than the leading analytic @xmath51 correction .",
    "as will be seen , it is also marginal in the sense that for @xmath20 only the single - pair term contributes to the nonanalyticity .",
    "both contributions were identified by pethick and carneiro @xcite .",
    "they can be also clearly seen in the `` paramagnon model '' @xcite of electrons coupled to overdamped spin fluctuations ( although only the three - pair contributions were discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "the paramagnon part of the entropy is obtained by summing up loop diagrams with a small momentum transfer and is given by  @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the coupling constant in the paramagnon model ( see sec . [",
    "sec : zs ] below ) .",
    "one obtains one @xmath54 term from the process involving three real excited particle hole pairs by treating @xmath55 as a constant and expanding the @xmath56 to third order in @xmath57 .",
    "in addition , one obtains another @xmath54 term by combining one power of im@xmath58 ( representing a real excited particle - hole pair ) with the nonanalytic term in re@xmath59 ( representing the nontrivial dynamic structure arising from @xmath55 ) .",
    "the two processes evidently represent different physics and differ mathematically as well .",
    "the single - pair mechanism occurs already at the second - order in the interaction @xmath53 and is not specific to @xmath30 .",
    "a simple extension of the @xmath48 analysis to arbitrary integer @xmath60 shows that the single - pair mechanism yields a non - analytic @xmath61 in any dimension ( with an additional @xmath62 in odd dimensions ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the three - pair mechanism occurs to third order in the interaction and gives rise to non - analyticity in @xmath63 only in odd dimensions @xmath64 .",
    "let us consider the kinematics of these contributions in more detail . in both processes ,",
    "the nonanalyticity arises from landau damping , which for the physically relevant limit of @xmath65 is dominated by fermions with momenta nearly perpendicular to @xmath66 . for a single - pair process , represented , e.g. , by diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : omegas ] 2b ) , the constraint that the momenta on all four fermion lines are perpendicular to the same vector @xmath66 implies that in two dimensions all four momenta are either nearly parallel to each other or two are nearly antiparallel to the other two .",
    "a closer analysis @xcite shows that only the nearly antiparallel case contributes to the nonanalyticity in @xmath2 so the nonanalyticity is controlled by backscattering .",
    "however , it appears surprising that backscattering would play a special role in @xmath48 .",
    "indeed , in @xmath30 the constraint that all four momenta are perpendicular to @xmath16 implies only that all four momenta lie in a common plane , so that any multiparticle excitation would seem to involve a more general scattering process involving four fermions , two of which have momenta near @xmath67 and two near @xmath68 but with @xmath69 and @xmath70 perpendicular to @xmath66 but not otherwise constrained . indeed",
    "the three pair contributions have precisely this structure .",
    "nevertheless we will show explicitly that in the single pair process only the case of nearly antiparallel momenta contributes .",
    "some physical understanding of the importance of backscattering even in @xmath48 may be obtained by considering the problem in a slightly more general way .",
    "the discussion just given has focussed on `` small momenta '' in the sense that it considered processes describable in terms of electron - hole pairs where the electron and the hole momenta are very close ( on the scale set by @xmath71 ) , and the nonanalyticity arises from the singular structure of the landau damping @xmath72 in the small @xmath73 limit",
    ". however , fermi liquids also exhibit nonanalyticities involving momenta near @xmath74 , ( reflected for example in the slow decay of friedel oscillations ) , and previous literature has raised the question of the contribution of @xmath74 processes to the nonanalytic behavior  @xcite . to understand this issue it is useful to consider again the simple perturbative contribution shown in diagram @xmath49 of fig . [",
    "fig : omegas ] , which may be written as the product of two particle - hole bubbles : @xmath75 there are two possible momentum regions which may give rise to nonanalyticities : small momentum and @xmath76 .",
    "consider the contribution to @xmath77 arising from large momentum transfer , @xmath78 .",
    "the nonanalyticity arises from the `` landau - damping '' structure of @xmath79 , which in @xmath48 and for momenta near @xmath74 is @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "we note that the orientation of @xmath66 is irrelevant , so @xmath82 becomes a one - dimensional integral over the scalar quantity @xmath83 leaving a logarithm for @xmath30 .. the @xmath74 `` landau damping '' terms involve fermions with momenta close to @xmath71 , so that if @xmath84 then in each bubble one has one fermion of momentum @xmath85 and one with @xmath86 ; thus the @xmath74 contribution involves a one - dimensional process controlled by the `` backscattering amplitude '' @xmath87 .",
    "however , we may also view the diagram for @xmath77 in a different way , regarding the two fermion lines with momentum @xmath88 as a bubble with a small total momentum @xmath83 , and similarly with the two lines of momentum near @xmath89 .",
    "thus for the process with one real excitation and first dynamical correction to interaction , the @xmath74 contribution may be subsumed into the small @xmath16 contribution .    the total nonanalytic contribution to @xmath44",
    "may thus be described in terms of two sorts of small momentum processes .",
    "one may be thought of in terms of @xmath74 processes , and involves the vertex @xmath90 .",
    "the other arises from consideration of small @xmath16 processes and seemingly involves the effective interaction @xmath91 with arbitrary values of @xmath92 .",
    "graphically , the two contributions differ only by interchanging the two outgoing momenta in the effective interaction .",
    "it is thus plausible to expect that both contributions are expressed in terms of the spin and charge components of the same antisymmetrized vertex .",
    "the vertex @xmath90 is the spin part of the backscattering amplitude .",
    "we may expect that @xmath91 is expressed in terms of charge component of the same amplitude .",
    "if this is the case , then @xmath93 must be antiparallel to @xmath94 , i.e. , the original small @xmath16 , single - pair contribution also involves 1d process , and hence the total single - pair contribution involves 1d scattering .    for the three - pair mechanism , this argument does not hold .",
    "the kinematics of @xmath74 processes is such that if more than two pairs are involved the result does not have a strong enough nonanalyticity . indeed , combining three factors of im@xmath95 , we obtain only a regular term in @xmath44 .",
    "thus the argument for the presence , in the calculation , of a purely one - dimensional scattering process fails and backscattering plays no special role .",
    "a principal aim of the present paper is to present a more rigorous analysis substantiating the qualitative arguments given above . in this analysis",
    "the effects of single - pair and three - pair processes are separated and the contribution of each to the nonanalyticities in @xmath2 is determined in two and three dimensions .",
    "we calculate the specific heat coefficient @xmath96 by evaluating the difference between the thermodynamic potential , @xmath97 and its value at @xmath6 .",
    "the luttinger - ward expression for @xmath24 is @xcite @xmath98 + \\sigma g\\right ) + \\xi _ { \\mathrm{skel } }   \\label{omegadef}\\ ] ] with @xmath99 the exact self - energy ( regarded as a functional of the full green function @xmath100 ) and @xmath101 is the usual skeleton diagram expansion for all interaction corrections to @xmath24 that are not accounted for by the first two terms .",
    "the trace is taken over space , time and spin variables .",
    "it is not necessary to obtain the nonanalytic contributions the self - energy @xmath99 in order to evaluate the nonanalytic contributions to @xmath24 . for",
    "what appear to be historical reasons associated with the fact that nonanalytic contributions to @xmath99 were a focus of many earlier studies , the previous literature evaluates the tr@xmath102 $ ] separately from the other contributions , thereby effectively adding and subtracting contributions arising from nonanalyticities in @xmath99 .",
    "however , the stationary of @xmath103 with respect to variations of @xmath104 implies that it is in fact sufficient to consider only the skeleton diagram @xmath105 , which may be evaluated using the leading renormalized quasiparticle green function @xmath106 ^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath107 is the renormalization factor and @xmath108 is the renormalized fermi velocity .",
    "we emphasize that , in physical terms , this corresponds to expanding @xmath24 in the number of particle - hole pairs thermally excited above the ground state , but assuming that these interact according to the @xmath6 landau fermi liquid fixed - point hamiltonian .",
    "a further subtlety arises : even if the green function takes the fixed - point form , the @xmath74 particle - hole bubble will have a nonanalytic temperature dependence .",
    "however , as we discussed in the previous section , singular @xmath23 scattering can be re - expressed as small momentum scattering , and is fully accounted for if we restrict to small @xmath16 but consider wavy lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : omegas ] as antisymmetrized interactions , i.e. , as fixed - point vertices .",
    "the small-@xmath16 diagrams have nonanalyticities arising from the landau damping @xmath109 which has negligible temperature dependence .",
    "once the restriction to small @xmath16 is accomplished , we may calculate the leading low-@xmath9 behavior of @xmath110 by focusing only on the @xmath9-dependence arising from the difference between @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and neglecting any explicit temperature dependence of @xmath100 , @xmath99 or interaction vertices .",
    "these latter contributions give only analytic , @xmath113 corrections to @xmath11 .",
    "appendix a confirms this argument by presenting an explicit calculation of the contribution to @xmath114 arising from @xmath74 processes .",
    "one can employ two strategies to calculate nonanalytic terms in @xmath115 the first one is to evaluate the thermodynamic potential directly in matsubara frequencies @xmath116 .",
    "this strategy was adopted in recent study of 2d systems@xcite .",
    "a drawback of this approach is that it does not distinguish between the real and imaginary parts of @xmath117 , and the physical picture of excited particle - hole pairs does not arise . the second and more intuitive ",
    "approach , adopted in this paper , is to work in real frequencies , when im@xmath118 and re@xmath119 have different physical meaning : the former describes real particle - hole pairs with given momentum and energy , whereas the latter describes the interaction arising from virtual pairs .    to evaluate non - analytic terms in @xmath24 for a generic fermi liquid",
    "we need two quantities .",
    "the first one is the propagator @xmath120 describing a particle - hole pair with small total momentum @xmath16 and small energy @xmath121 respectively , and with the particle and hole momenta near the fermi surface and in direction @xmath122 the second one is the fully renormalized , particle - hole _ reducible _",

    "@xmath125 may be written as a sum of two terms : @xmath126 .",
    "the analytic part @xmath127 is a function of @xmath124 and @xmath128 and contains contributions from virtual processes involving states both near and far from the fermi level .",
    "the nonanalytic part , denoted by @xmath129 , is determined solely by the properties of fermi surface states and depends only on @xmath130 . expanding the product of two quasiparticle propagators near the fermi surface ,",

    "we absorb the factor of inverse velocity and the factors of quasiparticle weight into the definition of @xmath133 and we have specialized to rotationally invariant systems . the frequency - dependent part of the polarization bubble @xmath46 is obtained by averaging @xmath134 over @xmath135 : @xmath136 in 3d , @xmath137 in the perturbation theory , when the interaction depends only on the momentum transfer but not on the incoming momenta , one needs to know only the angle - averaged bubble",
    ". however , the interaction in a generic fermi liquid is described by a vertex @xmath138 which depends not only on the momentum transfer @xmath16 but also on the relative directions of the incoming momenta @xmath139 therefore we need need the @xmath135-dependent propagator @xmath140 . in evaluating @xmath97 we",

    "the basic reasoning for this was given long time ago by prange and kadanoff @xcite , who showed that in the migdal approximation , phonon contribution to the thermodynamic potential is confined to the fermi surface , and does not change appreciably when the fermi surface position changes .",

    "the analysis beyond leading order in the migdal parameter requires further analysis , not given here .",
    "however , for comparable electron - phonon and electron - electron couplings , the phonon renormalization of @xmath423 is of the same order as the purely electron one .      in the paramagnon model @xcite ,",

    "the idea that the interaction with zero sound may lead to a nonanalyticity in the specific heat was put forward by anderson @xcite . following this suggestion , balian and",
    "fredkin @xcite considered a phenomenological model which treated the interaction with zero sound in analogy with the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "however , an unphysical choice of the interaction vertex ( it remained nonzero at @xmath578 and thus did not satisfy the adler principle ) led balian and fredkin to the conclusion that the nonanalyticity in the self - energy was very strong ( @xmath579 ) .",
    "later , engelsberg and platzman @xcite pointed out that the zero - sound vertex vanishes as @xmath16 for @xmath580 , as it does for the deformation - potential - type interaction with phonons [ cf .",

    "it was _ assumed _ that this automatically implies a nonanalytic entropy . however , the two of us and collaborators have shown recently @xcite that this assumption is , generally speaking , incorrect , and that the interaction with zero sound in 2d does _ not _ lead to a nonanalyticity in the entropy to any order in the interaction .",
    "the most general argument is that the thermodynamic potential can be obtained directly in matsubara frequencies , by expanding the luttinger - ward functional in the bare ( fermion - fermion ) interaction .",
    "the zero - sound mode simply does not arise in this formalism .",
    "recently , catelani and aleiner @xcite argued away the forward - scattering ( and thus the zero - sound ) contribution to thermodynamics on the basis of gauge invariance of the fermi - liquid kinetic equation .    on a more technical level , we come back to the argument that a direct relation between the nonanalyticities in the self - energy and entropy exists only if fermions interact with slow boson modes , so that the self energy is approximately @xmath67-independent ( `` local '' ) . as the zero - sound velocity is necessarily larger than the fermi velocity , this relation does not have to hold for this case .",
    "the breakdown of this relation becomes evident on examination of the real - frequency analogue of eq.([ch_10 ] )    @xmath586 , \\label{feb5_1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath587 and @xmath588 is the fermi function . in a local theory , the @xmath67 integral of the @xmath589@xmath590 term in eq.([feb5_1 ] ) vanishes , and only @xmath591 contributes to @xmath63 . in a non - local theory , both the @xmath591 and the @xmath592 terms contribute .",

    "although we have not performed such a calculation in 3d , we believe that the result will be the same as in 2d , i.e. , the zero - sound contribution vanishes .",
    "this also follows from the simple argument that in the rpa ( ring ) approximation in 3d , the entropy for the interaction with zero - sound is given by eq.([sn ] ) , in which the argument of the logarithm is replaced by the inverse effective interaction @xmath593 .",
    "near the zero - sound pole , @xmath594 and the zero - sound contribution to the entropy coincides with that of a free bosonic mode .",
    "accordingly , the entropy is analytic and scales as @xmath571@xcite .",

    "there are however three qualitative distinctions between their results and ours .",
    "first , amit et al . argued that the non - analytic @xmath596 term in the self - energy comes only from the landau damping term ( @xmath47 ) in the polarization bubble .",

    "we showed in the previous subsection that this interaction does not contribute to @xmath43 term in @xmath285 .",
    "third , amit et al . argued that @xmath23 scattering does not contribute to thermodynamic potential to second order in the interaction .",
    "we found that the contributions from small momentum scattering and from @xmath23 scattering are identical at this order ( up to prefactors @xmath598 and @xmath599 ) .",
