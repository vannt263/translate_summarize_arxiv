    "it has been realized that measurements provide a powerful toolbox to manipulate the state of quantum systems in ways that might be difficult to achieve with standard interactions .",
    "an example is the possibility of quantum computing with only single photon sources , linear optics , and photo detectors @xcite .",
    "a measurement may consist in observing a part of a larger system such as in several recent experiments preparing various quantum states of light by conditional detection of a small part of the light field @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may use a probe to gain information about the state of a system as in atomic spin squeezing by use of faraday rotation @xcite . in the latter case",
    ", the measurement should ideally be constructed in such a way that the interaction between the probe and the system does not affect the time evolution of the measured observable .",
    "a particularly interesting case arises , when the measured observable has degenerate eigenvalues , since one may then obtain partial information about the state of the system , while leaving a specific subspace unaffected .",
    "this opens the way to use measurements to prepare macroscopic quantum superposition states @xcite and to detect errors in quantum computations without destroying the quantum information stored in the qubits @xcite .",
    "an example is the three - qubit bit - flip code , where each qubit is encoded in the two states @xmath0 and @xmath1 of three physical qubits , and a single bit - flip error can be detected by measuring the parity of qubits 1 and 2 and the parity of qubits 2 and 3 .",
    "other applications of parity measurements include entanglement generation @xcite , quantum computing @xcite , and state transfer @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been proposed to perform a continuous parity measurement on two qubits in a cavity quantum electrodynamics network by allowing a coherent state probe to interact sequentially with the two qubits and then measure the phase shift imposed on the probe light with a homodyne detector @xcite .",
    "more precisely , each qubit is encoded in two ground state levels @xmath2 and @xmath3 of a single atom in a cavity , and the probe light couples the state @xmath3 resonantly to an excited state @xmath4 . in the strong coupling limit ,",
    "the vacuum rabi splitting prevents the light from entering into the cavity if the atom is in the state @xmath3 @xcite , and each interaction thus leaves the probe light unaffected except for a conditional phase shift of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the measurement takes a finite amount of time due to uncertainties arising from shot noise , and it is suitable for continuous quantum error correction , where feedback is used to keep the state of the qubits within the code space as far as possible @xcite .",
    "quantum error correction is often thought of as strong measurements followed by fast corrections , but continuous error correction contains some interesting aspects due to the intrinsic robustness of feedback control .",
    "in fact , in @xcite a setup has been proposed in which the above interaction is used , but rather than detecting the probe field , the probe field is used in a coherent feedback loop , which automatically corrects errors such that the state of the qubits remains close to the code space at all times .",
    "independent of whether the probe field is detected or used for coherent feedback , it is important to minimize decoherence within the parity subspaces due to the interaction with the probe .",
    "the above scheme is sensitive to light field losses between and within the two cavities as well as to spontaneous emission from the excited state of each atom , arising because the field is not completely expelled when the coupling strength is finite . in the present paper we show that a slight change of the setup can decrease the rate of decoherence in the odd or the even parity subspace by about one order of magnitude .",
    "the basic idea is to allow the light field to interact several times with the two qubits by reflecting some of the light emerging from the second cavity back onto the input mirror of the first cavity as shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] . for the odd subspace ( and @xmath6 ) ,",
    "the light field experiences a phase shift of @xmath5 for each round trip in the loop , and the resulting destructive interference between light fields having traveled a different number of round trips in the loop almost extinguishes the field . the difference between the field amplitudes obtained for the two possible states within the odd subspace is thus small , and this improves the robustness of the measurement with respect to loss .",
    "the destructive interference also decreases the field amplitudes inside the qubit cavities , which reduces the rate of spontaneous emission events and further decreases the decoherence rate . on the other hand , the sensitivity of the measurement is not decreased , since the even parity subspace leads to constructive interference in the loop , i.e. , the phase of the output field differs by @xmath5 for the two subspaces as before .",
    "we note that the roles of the odd and the even parity subspaces could be exchanged by adding a phase shift of @xmath5 within the loop , but in the following we focus on protecting the odd subspace .",
    "the reason for this is that the output field is not exactly the same for the two even parity states , because spontaneous emission is possible for @xmath7 but not for @xmath8 , and as a result the homodyne detection of the output field does not leave the even subspace completely unaffected .",
    "while this makes the analysis slightly more complicated , it will not have any significant effects , since the corrections are of second order .",
    "a parity measurement can also be realized with a light field , which is far detuned from the atomic transition , and this possibility will also be investigated .",
    "is in a continuous coherent state , and the output field @xmath9 is observed with a homodyne detector .",
    "the greek letters label the field at different positions , @xmath10 is the reflectivity of the input beam splitter , @xmath11 is the phase factor imposed on the light field by the phase shifter , and @xmath12 is the fraction of photons that are lost , when light travels from cavity 1 to cavity 2.[setup ] ]    in sec .",
    "[ ii ] we provide the theoretical framework required to analyze the proposed setup , and we obtain expressions for the field amplitudes , which substantiate the above statements . in sec .",
    "[ iii ] we derive an equation for the time evolution of the purity of a state restricted to either the odd or the even parity subspace and identify the parameters , which characterize the performance of the proposal .",
    "these parameters are evaluated for a nonresonant light - atom interaction in sec .",
    "[ iv ] and for a resonant light - atom interaction in sec .",
    "we also compute the optimal value of the reflectivity @xmath10 of the input beam splitter and compare the performance of the resonant and the nonresonant interaction . finally , sec .",
    "[ vi ] concludes the paper .",
    "to analyze the setup in fig .",
    "[ setup ] , we first consider the interaction between an atom and a single light field mode . the atom is assumed to have two degenerate ground state levels @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and the light field couples the state @xmath3 to an excited state @xmath4 . in",
    "a frame rotating with the angular frequency @xmath13 of the light field , the master equation for the interaction takes the form @xmath14 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}(2\\sigma\\rho\\sigma^\\dag-\\sigma^\\dag\\sigma\\rho -\\rho\\sigma^\\dag\\sigma),\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the hamiltonian , @xmath16 is the density operator , @xmath17 is the decay rate of the excited state of the atom , @xmath18 is the atomic lowering operator , @xmath19 is the light - atom coupling strength , @xmath20 is the field annihilation operator , and @xmath21 is the detuning between the atomic resonance angular frequency and the angular frequency of the light field .    in the markov limit , where all time delays go to zero , one could derive a quantum filtering equation for the time evolution of the state of the full system depicted in fig .",
    "[ setup ] , for instance by using the time evolution obtained for the measurement free case in @xcite and add homodyne detection @xcite . here , however , we are solely interested in the parameter regime , where the probability to populate the excited atomic level is small since observation of a photon emitted by spontaneous emission allows us to distinguish the two states in the odd subspace and to distinguish the two states in the even subspace .",
    "we thus assume that either the decay rate or the absolute value of the light - atom detuning is large compared to the effective driving of the atomic transition , which sum up to the condition @xmath22 when is satisfied , we can use the procedure outlined in @xcite to obtain an approximation to the light - atom interaction dynamics by assuming @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and taking the limit @xmath26 , which transforms into @xmath27 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\frac{g^2}{(\\gamma/2)^2+\\delta^2}\\\\ \\times(2\\hat{a}|1\\rangle\\langle1|\\rho|1\\rangle\\langle1|\\hat{a}^\\dag -\\hat{a}^\\dag\\hat{a}|1\\rangle\\langle1|\\rho-\\rho|1\\rangle\\langle1|\\hat{a}^\\dag\\hat{a}),\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the hilbert space of the atom is now restricted to @xmath28 .",
    "the interaction in is a state dependent phase shifter combined with a state dependent loss term , which can be modeled as a beam splitter coupling the cavity field to a vacuum field followed by a partial trace over the vacuum field . since beam splitters , mirrors , and phase shifters all",
    "transform the field operators linearly , and since homodyne detection of the output field does not affect the coherent amplitudes of the unobserved field modes , the state of the system at time @xmath29 may be represented as @xmath30 here , @xmath31 and @xmath32 specify the state of the atom in cavity @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are time dependent scalars .",
    "the light field in the loop is divided into @xmath35 modes of temporal width @xmath36 and conditional amplitude @xmath37 normalized such that @xmath38 is the conditional expectation value of the number of photons in the @xmath39th mode . in fig .",
    "[ setup ] , we have labeled five such modes . the fields in cavity 1 and 2 are treated as single mode fields with conditional amplitudes @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the round trip time of light in cavity @xmath33",
    ".      in general , the conditional field amplitudes are time dependent , but if the input field is turned on at time @xmath42 and is constant for @xmath43 , the amplitudes approach constant values at a rate which , in the limit @xmath44 , is the smallest of the decay rates of the light fields in cavity 1 and 2 . to compute the steady state field amplitudes",
    ", we note that the light - atom interaction in cavity @xmath45 combined with the cavity - light detuning transform the cavity field amplitude as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 @xmath48 is the kronecker delta , and @xmath49 is the detuning between the resonance angular frequency of cavity @xmath33 and the angular frequency of the light field . treating the mirrors as beam splitters with zero transmissivity and assuming that a fraction @xmath12 of the photons is lost in the reflection at the lower mirror in fig .",
    "[ setup ] , we then obtain @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the reflectivity of the input beam splitter of cavity @xmath33 . from these relations we derive @xmath60",
    "if the atom and cavity parameters are the same for cavity 1 and 2 , it follows that @xmath61 , i.e. , the output field is exactly the same for the two two - qubit states with odd parity .",
    "this is a very important property of the system , since it ensures that it is impossible to destroy a superposition of odd parity states by doing any kind of measurements on the output field , and , in particular , inefficient detection does not give rise to decoherence in the odd subspace . in appendix",
    "[ a ] , we show that this is valid even during the transient and for a time dependent input field .    since @xmath62 is typically very close to unity , we should choose @xmath63 , @xmath45 , to be close to unity as well in order to allow @xmath64 to be significantly different from unity .",
    "we can thus expand @xmath62 and @xmath65 to first order to obtain @xmath66 and @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the cooperativity parameter , @xmath69 is the cavity decay rate , @xmath70 , and for reasons that will appear below , we have chosen the cavity - light detuning such that @xmath71 .",
    "note that @xmath72 , which is a consequence of energy conservation .    for a resonant light - atom interaction @xmath73 , we observe that @xmath74 , while @xmath75 for @xmath76 , i.e. , the light experiences an additional phase shift of @xmath5 if the atom is in the state @xmath3 rather than @xmath2 . as noted in the introduction ,",
    "we obtain destructive interference in the loop if we choose @xmath6 , and for @xmath77 we find @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , which is the optimal situation for a parity measurement .",
    "note also that @xmath81 is small when @xmath10 is high , and this decreases the number of photons lost through spontaneous emission and other light field losses . in the nonresonant case @xmath82 , @xmath83 due to the specific choice of cavity - light detuning above .",
    "the light field thus experiences one phase shift if the atom is in state @xmath3 and the opposite phase shift if the atom is in state @xmath2 .",
    "the overall phase shift per round trip is thus zero in the odd subspace , and we choose @xmath84 to obtain destructive interference in the loop . for @xmath85 and identical atom and cavity parameters , the conditional output field amplitudes satisfy @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and a parity measurement can be achieved by detecting the @xmath88-quadrature of the output field .",
    "if the atom and cavity parameters are not identical and @xmath89 , @xmath90 , we still have @xmath91 and @xmath87 and this is sufficient to facilitate a parity measurement , but detection inefficiency now leads to decoherence within the odd subspace . the relations @xmath91 and @xmath87 are also valid during the transient as may be inferred from eq .",
    "having computed the steady state field amplitudes , we can now check whether assumption is consistent .",
    "the assumption is only relevant if the considered atom interacts with the light field , and for cavity 1 we thus compute @xmath92 conditioned on atom 1 being in state @xmath3 and atom 2 being in state @xmath93 , which leads to the condition @xmath94 the first factor is the number of photons in the input beam per unit time relative to the average spontaneous emission rate of an atom with an average probability of one half to be in the excited state .",
    "we anticipate that @xmath95 is chosen such that this factor is of order unity or smaller .",
    "the second factor is small if @xmath96 .",
    "in fact , this factor is of order @xmath97 independent of whether @xmath98 , @xmath99 , or @xmath100 . in the resonant case @xmath101",
    "this appears because the possibility of spontaneous emission prevents the cavity field from building up , while in the nonresonant case @xmath100 it is a consequence of the fact that the driving of the transition from @xmath3 to @xmath4 is inefficient when the atom - light detuning is large .",
    "the second factor is also small if @xmath102 , but this is uninteresting , since in that limit the atom does not interact significantly with the field and @xmath103 . regarding the third factor",
    ", we note that @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 all have a norm , which is smaller than or equal to one .",
    "the factor is of order unity or smaller unless @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath110 are all close to plus one , which corresponds to the situation of constructive interference in the loop .",
    "we thus require @xmath111 .    from a semiclassical point of view",
    "the problem in having a too large input field to cavity 1 is that the nonlinearity of the maxwell - bloch equations for the cavity field can no longer be neglected and this can give rise to complicated dynamics such as quantum jumps at random times between two different quasi steady states @xcite .",
    "for the same set of parameters , it is , for instance , possible to have a low amplitude of the cavity field and a low excitation of the atom or to have a large cavity field amplitude and a strong driving of the atom between @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the former possibility is similar to the case of a low input field considered in the present paper , but , except for the spontaneous emission events , the latter is similar to the situation where the atom is in the state @xmath2 .",
    "it is then difficult to distinguish @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and the setup is no longer suitable for a parity measurement .",
    "the condition for cavity 2 adds the requirements @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "we note that cooperativity parameters around hundred have been achieved in experiments , see for instance @xcite , and the above approximation is thus realistic .",
    "in the considered parity measurement scheme there is no mechanism , which transforms any of the four possible two - qubit states into each other , but the measurement gradually projects the state onto either the even or the odd subspace . ideally , the measurement is unable to distinguish states within the odd subspace and to distinguish states within the even subspace , and a main indication of the quality of the measurement is thus the final purity of an initially pure state in either the odd or the even subspace after a measurement time , which is sufficient to distinguish odd parity states from even parity states .    considering the odd subspace , the state of the system at time @xmath29 is given by with the additional requirements @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the entanglement between the atoms and the cavity fields reduces the purity of the atomic state during the measurement , but this purity is regained , when the input field is turned off and the cavity fields decay to the vacuum state . while the rate of nonregainable loss of purity may be slightly different during the initial and final transients , we do not expect anything dramatic to happen , since the transient dynamics does not break the symmetry , which ensures that the odd parity states are indistinguishable in the output field . for a total measurement time",
    "@xmath116 , which is long compared to the transients , we may thus concentrate on the rate of loss of purity in steady state .",
    "( this is a matter of @xmath95 being sufficiently small , since the duration of the transients does not depend on @xmath117 , while @xmath118 as we shall find below . )    in the time interval from @xmath29 to @xmath119 several interactions take place .",
    "the coherent state @xmath120 in cavity 1 interacts with the atom and an average number of @xmath121 photons are lost through spontaneous emission .",
    "the loss can be modeled as a beam splitter , which transforms @xmath122 into @xmath123 , where @xmath124 , followed by a trace over the last mode . in steady state , @xmath125 is transformed back into @xmath120 before the next interaction with the atom .",
    "the overall transformation is thus @xmath126 while @xmath127 and @xmath128 are unchanged .",
    "spontaneous emission in cavity 2 leads to a similar transformation , and loss through the lower mirror in fig .",

    "finally , homodyne detection of the @xmath88-quadrature of the output field leaves the state unchanged if @xmath132 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath86 , it does not even lead to decoherence if the output field is simply traced out , which is why we do not consider detection inefficiency here .    collecting the factors for the whole measurement from @xmath133 to @xmath116 and neglecting transients , the final purity of the atomic state after the measurement evaluates to @xmath134,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath135 is the density operator of the state of the atoms obtained by tracing out the light fields , @xmath136 is the rate of spontaneous emission events for atom @xmath33 , and @xmath137 represents the rate at which it would be possible to distinguish the two states within the odd subspace if the light lost at the lower mirror in fig .",

    "<S> a parity measurement on two qubits , each consisting of a single atom in a cavity , can be realized by measuring the phase shift of a probe beam , which interacts sequentially with the two qubits , but imperfections lead to decoherence within the subspaces of a given parity . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that a different setup , where the probe light interacts repeatedly with the qubits , can reduce the rate of decoherence within the odd or the even parity subspace significantly . </S>",
    "<S> we consider both the case of a resonant and the case of a nonresonant light - atom interaction and find that the performance is comparable if the parameters are chosen appropriately . </S>"
