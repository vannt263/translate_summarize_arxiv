    "in 2010 , the rhic beam energy scan program was launched to study the features of the qcd phase diagram and to search for signs of the possible first - order phase transition between the confined and deconfined matter @xcite .",
    "the existence of a critical point marking the boundary of cross - over and the aforementioned first - order phase transition in the plane of baryochemical potential @xmath0 and temperature @xmath1 was predicted by lattice calculations @xcite ; it has , however , been put to question by the continuum extrapolated results @xcite which suggest the phase transition remaining cross - over also at large values of @xmath0 .",
    "elliptic flow @xmath2 is one of the key observables that supports the formation of a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma at the highest energies of rhic and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "thus the naive expectation for @xmath2 in the beam energy scan would be a decrease at lower beam energies where the hydrodynamic phase is short or the qgp is not created at all .",
    "however , the measured inclusive charged hadron elliptic flow @xmath2 demonstrates relatively little dependence on the collision energy @xmath3 between 7.7 and 39 gev @xcite .",
    "one possible method for investigating the importance of the hydrodynamical evolution for the flow production is the hybrid approach , where one uses a transport model for the non - equilibrium phases at the beginning and in the end of a heavy - ion collision event , and hydrodynamics for the intermediate hot and dense stage and the phase transition between the quark - gluon plasma and hadronic matter .",
    "this approach should be applicable for a wide range of heavy ion collision energies and thus optimal for studying the beam energy dependence of the flow observables down to @xmath4 gev , an energy reachable also at the future heavy ion collisions at fair .",
    "in this study , a transport + hydrodynamics hybrid model by petersen _",
    "@xcite is utilized .",
    "the initial state in this model is produced by the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) string / hadronic cascade @xcite .",
    "the transition to hydrodynamics is done when the two colliding nuclei have passed through each other : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 represents the nuclear radius and @xmath7 is the lorentz factor .",
    "the minimum time of 0.5 fm has been determined by the model results at the collision energy @xmath8 gev @xcite . at @xmath9 , the energy- , momentum- and baryon number densities of the particles , represented by lorentz - contracted 3d gaussian distributions with the width @xmath10 fm ,",
    "are mapped onto the hydro grid .",
    "spectator particles are excluded from this procedure and propagated separately in the cascade .",
    "the shasta algorithm @xcite is used to solve the ( 3 + 1)-d ideal hydrodynamics evolution equations .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) is based on a hadronic chiral parity doublet model with quark degrees of freedom , coupled to polyakov loop to include the deconfinement phase transition @xcite .",
    "it possesses the important feature of being applicable also at finite baryon densities . at the end of the hydrodynamical evolution , the active eos",
    "is changed to the hadron gas eos , so the active degrees of freedom on both sides of the transition hypersurface match exactly @xcite .",
    "the particlization , i.e. the transition from hydro to transport , is done when the energy density @xmath11 reaches the critical value @xmath12 , where @xmath13 mev/@xmath14 is the nuclear ground state energy density .",
    "the particle distributions are generated according to the cooper - frye formula from the iso - energy density hypersurface , which is constructed using the cornelius hypersurface finder @xcite .",
    "the rescatterings and final decays of these particles are then computed in the urqmd .",
    "the final distribution of particles can then be directly compared against the experimental data .",
    "it has been tested that the hybrid model has a reasonable agreement with the experimental data for particle @xmath15 spectra at midrapidity @xmath16 for energies ranging from @xmath17 agev to @xmath8 gev @xcite .",
    "in this study , the flow coefficients @xmath18 are computed from the particle momentum distributions using the event plane method @xcite .",
    "this , together with the new implementation of the cooper - frye hypersurface finder and particlization , forms the core difference compared to previous studies of elliptic flow in the same hybrid approach @xcite .",
    "the primary interest in the following is to see , if the experimentally observed weak sensitivity of the elliptic flow on the collision energy is manifested also in the hybrid model results .",
    "figures [ figure_v2_phases]a and [ figure_v2_phases]b show the @xmath19-integrated elliptic flow @xmath2 produced in au+au -collisions for the @xmath19 range 0.2 - 2 gev , compared with the star data for the ( 0 - 5)% and ( 30 - 40)% centrality classes . in the model",
    "these are respectively represented by the impact parameter intervals @xmath20 fm and @xmath21 fm .",
    "figure [ figure_v2_phases]c shows the differential @xmath22 for @xmath23 fm , which roughly corresponds to ( 20 - 30)% centrality class .",
    "figures [ figure_v2_phases]a and [ figure_v2_phases]b also demonstrate the magnitude of @xmath2 at three different times : just before the hydrodynamics phase begins , right after the hydrodynamics phase has ended and particlization has been done , and after the hadronic rescatterings have been performed in the urqmd ( in other words , after the full evolution ) .    in the most central collisions",
    "the effect of the hadronic rescatterings is negligible ; in the impact parameter range @xmath21 fm the rescatterings contribute about 10% on the final result .",
    "the hydrodynamics also produce very little elliptic flow at @xmath24 gev ; for the mid - central collisions , @xmath2 is in practice completely produced by the transport dynamics , which include resonance formation and decay and string excitation and fragmentation processes .",
    "these initial dynamics , which are often neglected in other hybrid approaches , gain importance at lower energies . on the other hand , above @xmath25 gev the hydrodynamic phase is clearly the dominant source of @xmath2 .",
    "the simulation results overshoot the experimental data for all collision energies .",
    "this suggests that either the viscous corrections should be included , or the energy density value chosen for particlization should be higher . in the most central collisions below @xmath26 gev , the model appears to produce too much flow already at transport phase ; here having agreement with the data would require modifications in how the pre - equilibrium phase is handled .",
    "however , for the purposes of this study , the most important feature is the good qualitative agreement in the midcentral collisions , as here the flow effects are at their largest .",
    "also @xmath22 ( fig .",
    "[ figure_v2_phases]c ) has relatively weak dependence on @xmath3 , which is in accordance with the star results .     for @xmath27 gev , at the beginning of hydrodynamical evolution ( diamonds ) , immediately after particlization ( squares ) and after the full simulation ( circles ) in a ) central collisions and b ) midcentral collisions , compared with the star data @xcite ( stars ) .",

    ", we do the same analysis for another flow observable : the triangular flow @xmath30 , which originates purely from the event - by - event variations in the initial spatial configuration of the colliding nucleons , and is thus largely independent of the collision geometry .",
    "as illustrated by figure  [ figure_v3]a , the @xmath19-integrated @xmath30 increases from @xmath31 to above 0.015 with increasing collision energy in the most central collisions , whereas in midcentrality @xmath23 fm there is a rapid rise from @xmath32 at @xmath33 gev to the value of @xmath34 for @xmath35 gev .",
    "the collision energy dependence is seen also for midcentral @xmath36 in fig .",
    "[ figure_v3]b .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath30 in midcentral collisions qualitatively resembles the hydrodynamically produced @xmath2 in figure  [ figure_v2_phases]b .",
    "thus for the higher flow coefficients , which are more sensitive to viscosity , the transport part of the model is unable to compensate for the diminished hydro phase .     at midrapidity @xmath28 in central ( @xmath20 fm ) and midcentral ( @xmath23 fm ) collisions for collision energies @xmath37 gev .",

    "the average eccentricity and triangularity are of the same magnitude in the most central collisions , where the nuclear overlap region is nearly isotropic .",
    "the situation changes in mid - central collisions , where , due to the collision geometry , @xmath39 is clearly larger than @xmath40 . the observed dependence on collision energy is largely explained by @xmath9 , which changes rapidly at low energies , from 5.19 fm at @xmath4 gev to 1.23 fm at @xmath25 gev . at low energies",
    "there is thus enough time for the pre - equilibrium transport to decrease the initial spatial anisotropies .",
    "figure  [ figure_eccentricity]b shows the coefficients @xmath2 and @xmath30 scaled with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the relation of the elliptic flow to the initial eccentricity remains largely unchanged for the whole collision energy range , while the @xmath30 response to the triangularity of the initial state saturates only after 19.6 gev .",
    "this suggests that the hadronic medium is too viscous to convert initial state fluctuations into triangular flow , and a sufficiently long - living intermediate phase with a low - viscosity fluid is needed for the @xmath30 production .",

    "we have demonstrated that the experimentally observed behavior of @xmath2 as a function of collision energy @xmath3 can be qualitatively reproduced utilizing a hybrid transport + hydrodynamics approach . the diminished hydrodynamical evolution for @xmath2 production at lower collision energies",
    "is compensated by the pre - equilibrium transport dynamics .",
    "this compensation does not apply to triangular flow @xmath30 , which decreases considerably faster , reaching zero in midcentral collisions at @xmath4 gev .",
    "this makes @xmath30 the better signal for the formation of quark - gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions .",
