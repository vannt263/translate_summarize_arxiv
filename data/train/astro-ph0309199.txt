    "neutron stars are dense , neutron - packed remnants of massive stars after their supernova explosions . recently , in both experiment and theory , much concern is focused on the neutron stars@xcite .",
    "one reason is to determine the equation of state ( eos ) of superdense matter , and then understand the early universe , its evolution to the present day and the various astrophysical phenomena ; the other one is that neutron star is one of the more possible sources of detectable gravitational waves . to understand neutron stars , the first thing is to understand its structure , such as the compositions , total masses , radii , redshifts etc . because of the strongly gravitational field and the high density , neutron stars must be studied in the framework of general relativity . for a static neutron star , giving eos , using tov equations@xcite , which are educed from einstein field equations , one can get an exact solution .",
    "but for a rotating neutron star , the components of einstein field equations become much difficult . nowadays , several approximate solutions of this problem were developed@xcite , in which hartle s slow rotation formalism@xcite is the most popular one .",
    "+ the properties of neutron stars such as masses , rotational frequencies , radii , moments of inertia and redshifts are sensitive to the eos of the matters@xcite . as the interior core contains most of the mass of neutron star , so attention to the eos is mostly focused on the core of neutron star , that is to the matters at density above several times of nuclear matter saturation density . in the core of neutron star ,",
    "the compositions still keep blurry in some degree due to the high density and uncertainty of strong interaction , but as density increasing in the neutron star , neutrons can drip out of nuclei and form a neutron gas ; and due to the urca process @xmath4 and the neutrality of neutron star , there are at least protons and electrons in the chemical equilibrium ; on the other hand , as the density increasing , hyperons will be dominant in the neutron stars@xcite . in this letter",
    ", the hartle s formalism will be used to deal with two kinds of rotating neutron stars : the traditional neutron stars , in which @xmath5 are the main elements ; and hyperon stars , in which @xmath6 are the main elements .",
    "the eoss of them will be considered in the relativistic @xmath0 model .",
    "+ in this letter , we adopt the metric signature - + + + , g = c=1 ( the factors g and c will be reinserted correctly in numerical calculation ) .",
    "in relativity , the space - time geometry of a rotating star in equilibrium is described by a stationary and axisymmetric metric of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the angular velocity of the local inertial frame and is proportional to the star s rotational frequency @xmath9 , which is the uniform angular velocity of the star relative to an observer at infinity .",
    "expanding the metric function through second order in @xmath9 , one has@xcite @xmath10,\\ ] ] @xmath11(1-\\frac{2m_{0}(r)}{r})^{-1},\\ ] ] @xmath12,\\ ] ] @xmath13,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the metric function and the mass of the nonrotaiting neutron star with the same central density , respectively ; @xmath16 is the legendre ploynomial of order 2 ; the perturbation functions @xmath17 are proportional to @xmath18 and are to be calculated from einstein field equations .",
    "+ from the @xmath19 component of einstein field equations , one gets@xcite @xmath20 where@xmath21^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] , @xmath22 , which denotes the angular velocity of the fluid relative to the local inertial frame .",
    "the boundary conditions are imposed as @xmath23 at the center , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is chosen arbitrarily . integrating eq.(6 )",
    "outward from the center of the star , one would get the function @xmath26 . outside the star , from eq.(6 )",
    "one has @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the total angular mementum of the star , which takes the form@xcite @xmath29 .",
    "so at the surface , one can determine the angular velocity @xmath9 corresponding to @xmath25 as @xmath30    from the @xmath31 and @xmath32 components of einstein field equations , one gets two coupled ordinary differential equations of @xmath33 and @xmath34 as@xcite @xmath35 @xmath36^{2}}-\\frac{4\\pi r^{2}(p+\\rho)}{r-2m_{0}(r)}p^{*}_{0}+\\frac{1}{12}\\frac{r^{4}j^{2}}{r-2m_{0}(r)}(\\frac{d\\bar{\\omega}}{dr})^{2 } + \\frac{1}{3}\\frac{d}{dr}[\\frac{r^{3}j^{2}\\bar{\\omega}^{2}}{r-2m_{0}(r)}],\\ ] ] where @xmath37 , here @xmath38 is a constant determined by the demand that @xmath34 be continuous across the star s surface .",
    "these equations are also integrated outward , with boundary conditions that both @xmath33 and @xmath39 vanish at the origin . with the same central density ,",
    "the difference between the mass of the rotating star and the non - rotating star is @xmath40 the difference of the mean radius is @xmath41",
    "there are several models to deal with the superdense matters , such as non - relativistic models , relativistic fieldtheoretical models@xcite . to different models ,",
    "the fracions of particles in the superdense matters are different , and then the bulk properties of superdense matters are different , that is , the eos of them are different . here",
    "the relativistic @xmath0 model will be adopted@xcite .",
    "the lagrangian density of this model is @xmath43 in which @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the field operator of baryon @xmath48(@xmath48=n , p for the traditional neutron stars , @xmath48=n , p , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 for the hyperon stars ) ; @xmath53 is the field operator of lepton @xmath54(@xmath54=@xmath55 , @xmath56 ) ; and @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 are the field operators of @xmath57 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 meson respectively ; @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 are the coupling constants between @xmath57 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 meson and baryon @xmath48 respectively . in general , the coupling constants between @xmath57(@xmath60 or @xmath61 ) meson and neutron and proton are equal and decided by saturated property of nuclear matter(@xmath65 ) and the symmetry energy of nuclear matter(@xmath66 ) ;",
    "@xmath67 are the mass of baryon , lepton , meson respectively ; @xmath68 is the isospin operator . to leptons , we assume they are free fermi gas . from this laglangian density",
    ", we can obtain the eos of the superdense matters , @xmath69 , in which , @xmath70 and @xmath61 are the pressure and energy density of the superdense matters , respectively . in 1-loop approximation ,",
    "the loop s contribution to the propagators of nucleon and @xmath57 meson is considered , and the renormalization is used to renormalizing the divergent part of loop contribution . in the numerical calculation , we adopt the value of the parameter as following@xcite : @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and the incompressibility of nuclear matter is @xmath80 , which is consistent with the experiment result@xcite . from fig.1 , it is clear that the eos of traditional neutron stars is stiffer than the eos of hyperon stars .    * fig.1 *",
    "in order to compare the numerical results with the observation , we present some typical observation value here . as we know , only a few masses have been determined in observation from the more than thousand neutron stars .",
    "there are two typical observed mass data : @xmath81@xcite for double neutron star binaries , and @xmath82(vela x-1)@xcite and @xmath83(cygnus x-2)@xcite for x - ray binaries .",
    "+ the numerical results for the rotating traditional neutron stars and hyperon stars in the relativistic @xmath0 model are showed in the following figures and table .",
    "+ figs.2 - 3 show the changes of masses and radii between rotating neutron stars and non - rotating neutron stars as function of rotational period . at a given central density ,",
    "it is easy to see that , as the neutron stars rotating slowly , the increment of the masses and radii will reduce sharply when the neutron stars rotational periods are small than 1 ms .",
    "but as the periods become bigger than 1.6ms , which is the period of the fastest rotating pulsars in observation@xcite , the change of the increment of the masses and radii caused by the rotation will become very week , and the increment will be no more than 2 percent .",
    "as the changes of the mass and radius to a real neutron star caused by the rotation are very small comparing with the total mass and radius , we can see that hartle s approximate method is rational .",
    "+ figs.4 - 7 show the masses and radii of rotating and non - rotating traditional neutron stars and hyperon stars as function of central density at a given central angular velocity relative to the local inertial frame . from these figures ,",
    "one can see that around the typical observational radii with value of 12 km , the increments of the radii are bigger than that of other place . in table 1 , some typical value in these figures are listed , combining fig.4 , fig.6 and the observational value , one can see that the double neutron star binaries are more like hyperon stars , while the neutron stars of x - ray binaries are more like traditional neutron stars . for the hyperon stars ,",
    "its eos is so soft that , even the period small than the smallest observational value , the total mass ca nt reach the observation value of x - ray binaries , about @xmath84 .",
    "+ fig.8 shows the period as a function of the central density at two giving central angular velocities relative to the local inertial frame . from this figure",
    ", one can see that bigger central density and bigger central angular velocity relative to the local inertial frame correspond with a smaller period . in fig.8",
    "one can find out that as the eos of hyperon star is softer , at the same conditions , the period of hyperon star is appreciably bigger than the period of the traditional neutron star .",
    "figs.9 - 10 show the masses and radii of the traditional neutron stars and hyperon stars as a function of period .",
    "one can see that even the central density of the hyperon stars is bigger than that of the traditional neutron stars , the masses and radii of the hyperon stars are smaller than that of the traditional neutron stars .",
    "another interesting result is that at a giving central density , when the period increases to a value which is bigger than the smallest observational period , 1.6ms , the change of the masses and the radii with the period is not obvious , which is consistent with the result of fig.2 .",
    "+ from these figures , one can see that at a giving period , the central density and the central angular velocity relative to the local inertial frame could be chosen freely .",
    "but if the masses and the period of a neutron star are given ( by the observational value ) at the same time , then the central density and the central angular velocity relative to the local inertial frame will be decided .",
    "as we know , there is another observational value : the radius of the neutron star , the decided central density and central angular are not always given the exactly radius .",
    "so one can say that if these three observational values : mass , radius and period are given to the same neutron star , there is only one special eos could give a set of calculating values , which are fit like a glove to the set of observational value , that is , these three observational values could decide the eos entirely .",
    "but the problem is that there is no neutron star with both mass and radius observationally determined up to the present .",
