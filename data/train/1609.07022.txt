    "the modern era of exact statistical treatments of the late - time steady states of 2d fluid flows , properly accounting for the infinite number of conserved integrals of the motion , began with the miller ",
    "robert  sommeria ( mrs ) theory of the 2d euler equation @xcite , generalizing earlier approximate treatments going all the way back to the seminal work of onsager @xcite , and progressing through the kraichnan energy ",
    "enstrophy theory @xcite , and various formulations of the point vortex problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since then , the theory has been applied to significantly more complex systems , containing multiple interacting fields ( in contrast to the euler equation , which reduces to a single scalar equation for the vorticity ) , but still possessing an infinite number of conserved integrals @xcite .",
    "these include , for example , magnetohydrodynamic equilibria @xcite , 3d axisymmetric flow @xcite , and the shallow water equations @xcite , as well as numerous other geophysical applications @xcite .",
    "the theory of the shallow water system was recently revisited in ref .",
    "@xcite ( hereinafter referred to as rvb ) .",
    "the work highlighted simplifying approximations made in previous work on this system @xcite , and aimed to move beyond them in order to generate more quantitative predictions .",
    "previous simplifications mainly involved the problem of dissipation of microscale gravity wave fluctuations .",
    "such physical effects are certainly physically present , in the form of nonlinear phenomena such as wave breaking or shock wave dissipation , but lie beyond the shallow water approximation ( which , in particular , assumes the length scale of horizontal motions to be much larger than the fluid depth ) . in previous work the small scale free surface fluctuations were simply set to zero at a convenient point in the calculation ( citing untreated dissipation processes ) , and mean field variational equations describing the remaining large scale eddy motion were then derived @xcite . in rvb ,",
    "the shallow water system , though idealized , is taken at face value , and an attempt is made to treat the wave fluctuations in a more consistent manner , but also within a mean field approximation .",
    "the result is a very interesting equilibrium state that includes both steady large scale eddy motions and finite microscale wave fluctuations .",
    "the key underlying physics here , also motivating earlier studies , is that the two nonlinearly interacting fields , surface height and eddy vorticity , when viewed in isolation , have very different turbulent dynamics .",
    "two - dimensional eddy systems governed by navier  stokes turbulence tend to self - organize into long - lived , large - scale coherent structures such as cyclones ( exemplified by jupiter s great red spot ) and jets , a consequence of the famous 2d inverse energy cascade @xcite .",
    "however , weak turbulence theory @xcite predicts that interacting acoustic waves , similar to 3d navier  stokes turbulence , possesses a forward cascade of energy , transporting it from larger to smaller scales where it is ultimately acted upon by viscosity or other microscopic dissipation mechanisms .",
    "when both motions are present , the question arises as to what the final disposition of the energy is .",
    "the rvb results propose a quantitative answer , predicting the equilibrium distribution of energy ( and other quantities of interest ) between the large - scale eddy and microscale wave motions , depending of course on all of the conserved integral values set , for example , by a flow initial condition .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to revisit deeper simplifying mathematical assumptions made in rvb that strongly impact the derived statistical equilibrium state .",
    "two key features are highlighted .",
    "first , the variational mean field results are at odds with other recent results for systems with multiple interacting fields which are only partially constrained by conservation laws ( in contrast , e.g. , to the euler equation , in which the vorticity field completely specifies the dynamics , while at the same time its fluctuations are strongly limited by the conservation laws ) .",
    "for example , for magnetohydrodynamic equilibria , the unconstrained degrees possess finite microscale fluctuations that lead to a non - mean field thermodynamic description of the large scale flow @xcite .",
    "an analogous result is derived here : the surface height fluctuations are not controlled by the vorticity conservation laws , and lead to a strongly fluctuating equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "physically , the microscale surface height fluctuations lead to a fluctuating effective coulomb - like interaction between vortices that does not self - average even on large length scales . a mean field description emerges only in an approximation where this effect is ignored .",
    "second , the formalism of statistical mechanics relies on identification of the correct phase space measure used to compute the thermodynamic free energy and perform statistical averages .",
    "this measure is determined by a liouville theorem that characterizes the geometry of phase space flows .",
    "in particular , when expressed in terms of the correct combination of fields , these flows are incompressible , and this constrains the phase space measure to be a function only of the conserved integrals of the motion ( expressed in terms of these particular field combinations ) . an issue addressed in this paper",
    "is that the correct liouville theorem is indeed derived in rvb , but is not actually implemented correctly to define the phase space measure .",
    "the authors recognize this , but propose various physical arguments why their chosen implementation , which simplifies the mathematics ( in particular , it makes the fields statistically independent ) , also makes more physical sense .",
    "if the motivation of the study was to follow the full consequences of the shallow water equations , prior to speculating on the effects neglected physics , there appears to be a basic inconsistency here . in the following",
    ", the full statistical theory is derived using the correct equilibrium phase space measure .",
    "the resulting theory leads to much more complex behavior , and indeed has some unusual physical consequences  for example , the microscale fluctuations lead to an equilibrium - averaged flow that does _ not _ satisfy the time - independent shallow water equations .",
    "of course , which theory more closely reflects physical reality remains an interesting question , but the point of view taken here is that one should at least start by adhering as rigorously as possible to the mathematically consistent predictions of the model .",
    "only following this should one attempt to insert physical considerations at various points to see what their affect might be .",
    "for example , a key consequence of the shallow water model is that the surface height fluctuations cascade to arbitrarily small wavelengths while at the same time maintaining a finite amplitude , thereby generating a kind of finite - thickness surface `` foam '' .",
    "it is the dynamics of this foam that leads to both the strongly fluctuating equilibrium and to the violation of the time - independent equations , and was suppressed at the outset in previous work @xcite .",
    "these are consistent predictions of the model , but is obviously inconsistent with any physical final state , which must emerge by inserting a dissipation step to obtain a `` true '' equilibrium .",
    "how to best accomplish this lies beyond the scope of this paper , and would be an interesting topic for future work .",
    "the aim of this paper is to formulate general statistical models of shallow water equilibrium states , and then explore some of their key , high - level features .",
    "more detailed , physically motivated , investigations of model predictions are left for future work .",
    "the outline of the remainder of this paper is as follows . in sec .",

[ sec : canonfields ] all quantities of interest are expressed in terms of the basic vorticity ( velocity curl ) , compressional ( velocity divergence ) , and fluid height fields .",
    "the free slip boundary conditions play a key role here , especially in multiply connected domains where a set of circulation integrals about each connected component of the boundary is separately conserved .",
    "the latter lead to an additional set of `` potential flow '' contributions to the energy , and also to the expressions for the linear or angular momentum ( in the case of translation or rotation invariant domains , respectively , where they are conserved ) .",
    "these have not been previously considered in the context of the shallow water system . in sec .",
    "[ sec : statmech ] the equilibrium statistical mechanics formalism is introduced , with the conservation laws handled by introducing conjugate `` chemical potentials '' within the grand canonical approach .",

    "the model also has a dual description in terms of the vortex degrees of freedom interacting through a fluctuating coulomb - like interaction . in sec .",
    "[ sec : furtherprops ] , we consider simplifying limits in which fluctuations are neglected .",
    "an approximate saddle point variational approach ( analogous to , but quantitatively different from , that derived by rvb ) is then used to illustrate further properties of the model .",
    "equivalent forms of this theory are derived from both the elastic membrane and coulomb models .",

    "<S> in recent work , renaud , venaille , and bouchet ( rvb ) @xcite revisit the equilibrium statistical mechanics theory of the shallow water equations , within a microcanonical approach , focusing on a more careful treatment of the energy partition between inertial gravity wave and eddy motions in the equilibrium state , and deriving joint probability distributions for the corresponding dynamical degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the authors derive a liouville theorem that determines the underlying phase space statistical measure , but then , through some physical arguments , actually compute the equilibrium statistics using a measure that _ violates _ this theorem . here , </S>",
    "<S> using a more convenient , but essentially equivalent , grand canonical approach , the full statistical theory consistent with the liouville theorem is derived . </S>",
    "<S> the results reveal several significant differences from the previous results : ( 1 ) the microscale wave motions lead to a strongly fluctuating thermodynamics , including long - ranged correlations , in contrast to the mean - field - like behavior found by rvb . </S>",
    "<S> the final effective model is equivalent to that of an elastic membrane with a nonlinear wave - renormalized surface tension . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) even when a mean field approximation is made , a rather more complex joint probability distribution is revealed . </S>",
    "<S> alternative physical arguments fully support the consistency of the results . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the true fluid final steady state relies on dissipative processes not included in the shallow water equations , such as wave breaking and viscous effects , but it is argued that the current theory provides a more mathematically consistent starting point for future work aimed at assessing their impacts . </S>"
