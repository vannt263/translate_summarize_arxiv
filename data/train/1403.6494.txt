    "proposed collision mechanisms that may determine hadron production in high energy nuclear collisions are strongly debated .",
    "candidate mechanisms range from projectile nucleon dissociation and parton fragmentation to dijets  @xcite to color reconnection of multiple parton interactions  @xcite , strong rescattering of partons and hadrons in a dense medium  @xcite , hydrodynamic flows  @xcite or a colored - glass condensate  @xcite , possibly including glasma flux tubes  @xcite .",
    "recent high energy data from the lhc and the emergence of apparently novel effects in  or d - a collisions have further stimulated debate .",
    "it is safe to assume that there is a direct connection between underlying collision mechanisms and the structure of the hadronic final state in yields , spectra , correlations , and especially jets as hadron correlations .",
    "however , how to characterize the final - state structure statistically and how to interpret it in terms of physical mechanisms remains an open question .",
    "all analysis methods are susceptible to bias , the information in the data may not be fully exploited , and physical mechanisms are conventionally represented by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations based on complex assumptions that may be questioned .    in the present study",

    "the trend of  increasing with centrality in   collisions is conventionally interpreted in terms of radial flow  @xcite .",
    "that interpretation suggests that the  trend in  collisions could also be associated with radial flow , with possibly larger magnitude .",
    "however , by the same argument if an alternative jet - related mechanism dominates  in  collisions that same mechanism could prevail in   collisions , misinterpreted there as radial flow  @xcite .",
    "we consider  vs  data for several energies from 200 gev to 7 tev and from  or  collisions ,  collisions and  collisions .",

    "we construct a tcm for  in  and   collisions and compare the tcm to data .",

    "details of the  systematics in  collisions follow the properties of independently - measured jet spectra and dijet production . and",
    "systematics in   collisions reflect previously - observed modification of jet structure in  spectra for more - central collisions .",

    "the cr / mpi mechanism is referred to as a collective effect .",
    "it is stipulated that any  increase with   centrality is conventionally attributed to radial flow of a dense medium , consistent with the so - called blast - wave model of   spectra for which one model parameter is @xmath5 , the radial flow velocity  @xcite .",

    "other lhc results such as a claimed same - side `` ridge '' at large @xmath6 in high - multiplicity  @xcite and  @xcite collisions suggest that flows may play a role at the lhc even in the smallest collision systems .",

    "some aspects of jet production are predicable via perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , and some are accurately known via a broad range of measurements . given the combination it is possible to make quantitative predictions for jet manifestations in hadron yields , spectra and correlations .",
    "for instance , substantial jet fragment contributions to 200 gev  @xcite and  @xcite collisions are described quantitatively by a combination of measured fragmentation functions  @xcite and minimum - bias ( mb ) jet spectra  @xcite .",
    "the same hadron spectrum features attributed to radial flow  @xcite are fully consistent with qcd jets for all  centralities  @xcite .",
    "certain jet - related structures in  and  angular correlations are also quantitatively related to single - particle spectrum structure by a qcd jet model  @xcite .",
    "the tcm provides an overarching framework for such comparisons .",
    "it assumes that the major contributions to yields , spectra and correlations consist of two components : ( a ) nucleon dissociation to soft hadrons and ( b ) scattered - parton fragmentation to correlated jets .",
    "successful implementation of the tcm requires appropriate differential analysis methods and an accurate and comprehensive description of mb jet production .",
    "a tcm reference is defined as linear superposition of a fundamental process : small-@xmath7 parton - parton interactions within  collisions or  interactions within   collisions .",
    "deviations from a tcm reference may then reveal novelty in the composite system .",
    "the tcm has few parameters and a simple algebra , in contrast to most mc models .",

    "we develop a two - component model ( tcm ) for total @xmath31 production ( within some angular acceptance ) in high energy nuclear collisions based on previous measurements of dijet production , parton fragmentation and jet spectra .",

    "the  analysis has several implications .",
    "the @xmath153 production generally follows binary - collision scaling according to the eikonal approximation as expected for jet production in   collisions .",

    "the increase of @xmath12 and decrease of @xmath95 is consistent with modifications to jet fragment distributions ( hard components ) observed in hadron  spectra .",
    "the systematics of jet modification in 2.76 tev  collisions appears to be very similar to those in 200 gev  collisions , the only differences being ( a ) the location of a sharp transition from  linear superposition (   transparency ) to strongly modified jets and ( b ) increase of soft multiplicity and hard jet - related components by factors @xmath156 and @xmath157 respectively as extrapolated from spectrum and correlation systematics at rhic energies .    generally speaking the tcm for  data provides a very compact data representation .",
    "much of the model is determined by prior measurements of other aspects of high energy nuclear collisions .",
    "the novelty arising in the  study is ( a ) the energy dependence of @xmath98 for  collisions found to comply with previously measured jet spectrum systematics , ( b ) the participant first - encounter effect already implicit in hadron production systematics and ( c ) variation of @xmath49 with  centrality which is qualitatively consistent with jet modifications in 200 gev  collisions described by pqcd .",
    "the  result which is said to present conceptual difficulties appears to be consistent with the tcms for  and   collisions , transitioning smoothly from the  trend at lower multiplicities ( quantitative agreement ) to a glauber linear superposition model of   collisions with no modification of jet fragmentation in more - central collisions ( close agreement with the functional form ) .",

    "<S> comparisons with several theory monte carlos reveal substantial disagreements and lead to considerable uncertainty on how to interpret the  data . in the present study </S>",
    "<S> we develop a two - component ( soft+hard ) model ( tcm ) of  production in high energy nuclear collisions and apply it to the  data . </S>",
    "<S> the soft component is assumed to be a universal feature of high energy collisions independent of a - b system or energy . </S>",
    "<S> the hard - component model is based on the observation that dijet production in  collisions does not satisfy the eikonal approximation but does so in   collisions . </S>",
    "<S> hard - component properties are determined from previous measurements of hadron spectrum hard components , jet spectra and fragmentation functions . </S>",
    "<S> the tcm describes the  and  data accurately , within data uncertainties , and the  data appear to transition smoothly from  to   trends . </S>"
