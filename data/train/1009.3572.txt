    "it has been known for a long time that rotation curves of neutral hydrogen clouds in the outer regions of galaxies can not be explained in terms of the luminous matter content of the galaxies , at least within the context of newtonian gravity or of general relativity ( see [ 1 ] for a review ) .",
    "in addition , the velocity dispersion in galaxy clusters indicates a much greater mass than would be inferred from luminous matter contained in the individual galaxies .",
    "the most widely accepted explanation , based on the standard gravitational theory , postulates that almost every galaxy hosts a large amount of nonluminous matter , the so called gravitational dark matter , consisting of unknown particles not included in the particle standard model , forming a halo around the galaxy .",
    "the dark matter provides the needed gravitational field and the mass required to match the observed galactic flat rotation curves in galaxy clusters .",
    "the dark matter problem arises because of a nave newtonian analysis of the near constant tangential velocity of rotation up to distances far beyond the luminous radius of the galaxies .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the energy density decreases with the distance as @xmath0 and therefore that the mass of galaxies increases as @xmath1 .",
    "there are several proposals for the dark matter component , ranging from new exotic particles such as those predicted by supersymmetry [ 2 ] to other less exotic candidates such as massive neutrinos or even ordinary celestial bodies such as jupiter like objects .",
    "several other analytic halo models exist in the literature including those sourced by scalar fields .",
    "fay [ 3 ] considered modelling by brans - dicke massless scalar field while matos , guzmn and nuez [ 4 ] considered massless minimally coupled scalar field with a potential . a boson star formed by a self interacting massive scalar field with quartic interaction potential as a model of galactic halo was investigated by colpi , shapiro and wasserman [ 5 ] .",
    "a similar boson star as a model of galactic halo was first investigated by lee and koh [ 6 ] .",
    "a recent halo model is discussed also in the braneworld theory [ 7 ] .",
    "some authors [ 8 ] have considered global monopoles as a candidate for galactic halo in the framework of the scalar tensor theory of gravity .",
    "alternatively , explanation of the observed flat rotation curve is provided through modification of newtonian dynamics ( in the region of very small accelerations ) [ 9,10 ] .",
    "another attempt to resolve the dark matter problem lies within the framework of weyl conformal gravity suggested by mannheim and kazanas [ 11 ] , with the distinction that it does not postulate flat rotation curve as an input but _ predict _ it .",
    "such a prediction is possible also within the chern simmons gravity inspired by string theory [ 12,13 ] .    in recent years",
    ", the amount of dark matter in the universe has become known more precisely : cmb anisotropy data indicate that about @xmath2 of total matter in a galaxy is dark in nature .",
    "big bang nucleosynthesis and some other cosmological observations require that the bulk of dark matter be non - baryonic , cold or warm , stable or long - lived and not interacting with visible matter . however , despite long and intensive investigations , little is as yet known about the nature of dark matter .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to show that , with the input of flat rotation curve and the assumption that dark matter be described as a perfect fluid , the general theory of relativity not only accounts for the dark matter component of galactic clusters but also suggests the spatial curvature of the universe .",
    "the gravitational influence of an arbitrary dark matter component is controlled by its stress tensor . in this context",
    "we note that , while the existing approaches of explaining flat rotation curves are useful in their own right , many of the models end up with predicting anisotropic dark matter fluid stress tensor . on the other hand ,",
    "no physical mechanism is stated explaining why a spherical distribution should have such anisotropy .",
    "there is also no observational evidence in support of it .",
    "therefore , it seems more reasonable to consider an isotropic perfect fluid distribution for dark matter because predictions from such model at stellar and cosmic scales have been observationally corroborated beyond any doubt .",
    "we shall particularly study the general features of dark matter such as its equation of state .",
    "the mass distribution in galactic haloes should provide a direct probe into the nature of particles constituting the dark matter because the inner structure of the halo is particularly sensitive to the dark matter properties [ 14 ] . in this investigation",
    ", we shall work only from a fluid perspective leaving the question about the particle identity of dark matter open .",
    "galactic rotational velocity profiles [ 15 ] of almost all the spiral galaxies are characterized by a rapid increase from the galactic center , reaching a nearly constant velocity from the nearby region of the galaxy far out to the halo region .",
    "our target is to exploit this observed feature to obtain the space - time metric in the halo region , and analyze it . as mentioned already ,",
    "observational data suggest that the dark matter component in the galaxy accounts for almost @xmath2 of its total mass .",
    "naturally , luminous matter does not contribute significantly to the total energy density of the galaxy , particularly in the halo region .",
    "therefore , we shall treat the matter in the galactic halo region as a perfect fluid defined by stresses @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the matter energy momentum tensor .",
    "the general static spherically symmetric spacetime is represented by the following metric @xmath5 where the functions@xmath6 and @xmath7 are the metric potentials .",
    "then the einstein field equations become ( @xmath8 ) : @xmath9 + \\frac{1}{r^{2}}=8\\pi g\\rho\\ ] ] @xmath10   -\\frac { 1}{r^{2}}=8\\pi gp\\ ] ] @xmath11   = 8\\pi gp.\\ ] ] for a circular stable geodesic motion in the equatorial plane , the consideration of flat rotation curve gives the condition ( see appendix ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 is an integration constant .",
    "the observed rotational curve profile in the region dominated by dark matter is such that the rotational velocity @xmath16 becomes approximately a constant with @xmath17 ( 300km / s ) for a typical galaxy .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) then lead to the following equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 an exact solution of eq.(6 ) is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an integration constant .",
    "several observations follow from the metric ( 1 ) :    * ( a ) * note that the space time metric given by eq.(1 ) through eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 9 ) is an interior solution .",
    "this type of spacetime definitely can not be asymptotically flat neither can it have the form of a spacetime due to a centrally symmetric black hole .",
    "what can be said is that this line element describes the region where the tangential velocity of the test particles is constant and that it has to be joined with the exterior region with other types of space time .",
    "the extent of @xmath16= constant ends at some larger distance where the region becomes asymptotically flat . in principle",
    ", the constant @xmath22 should be obtained from the junction conditions but the galactic boundary is not observationally defined yet .",
    "it is more likely that dark matter distribution will not remain the same near the periphery of the halo .    *",
    "( b ) * inserting the above solution in eqs .",
    "( 2 ) - ( 4 ) , one can readily get the expressions for @xmath23 , @xmath24 as @xmath25\\ ] ] @xmath26\\ ] ]    the most notable aspect is the presence of the last term in the expressions of both energy density @xmath23 and pressure @xmath24 that increases with radial distance ( from galactic center ) . note that according to the newtonian theory , which is supposed to be indistinguishable from general relativity in very weak field , one should expect only the term @xmath27 in agreement with the poisson equation , which integrates to give the newtonian mass @xmath28 increasing linearly with @xmath29 .",
    "but the input of the constant tangential velocity leads to general relativistic corrections to newtonian expressions as evident in eqs .",
    "( 10 ) , ( 11 ) .",
    "the first term of the right hand side of eq.(10 ) gives the expected newtonian term in the leading order and to the same order a general relativistic correction term @xmath30 .",
    "since @xmath13 is small , the correction terms are small as expected",
    ".    however , the second term in eq.(10 ) has completely different nature than the conventional feature of dark matter energy density ; the corresponding mass increases _ nonlinearly _ with radial distance @xmath29 , though a bit slowly as @xmath13 is very small .",
    "this contribution will vanish if @xmath22 vanishes .",
    "we would see that even @xmath31 is consistent with the flat rotation curve .",
    "* ( c ) * the parameter @xmath22 is recognized [ 17 ] as the spatial curvature ( with a negative sign ) of the universe .",
    "a comparison of the obtained space time metric in the limit @xmath32 with the static friedmann  lemitre - robertson  walker ( flrw ) metric [ @xmath33 ] leads to the identification that @xmath34 .",
    "since our input was only the flat rotation curve and we have not considered anything regarding cosmological spatial curvature while deriving the metric , the appearance of @xmath22 in the metric element is quite interesting .",
    "the solution thus may be thought of dark matter induced space - time embedded in a static flrw metric . in general @xmath35 and",
    "hence @xmath36 is not equal to @xmath37 , and the interpretation of spatial curvature does not seem at all evident .",
    "an immediate question is how a spatially curved flrw universe could be static .",
    "if it is due to balance of the curvature term by some other fluid with equation of state @xmath38 , the question of stability will arise .",
    "it seems that we have ended up with a static universe because right from the beginning we looked for a static solution ( all the metric element are considered time independent ) . while working on a local problem ( flat rotation curve ) , the universe is usually considered at any particular epoch fixing the scale factor @xmath39 to be constant ( often normalized to unity , @xmath40 at the present epoch ) .",
    "the dynamicity of the flrw metric is thus absent in local gravitational phenomena .",
    "however , we see in the present work that the curvature effect has appeared even in local gravitational phenomena",
    ". it would certainly be an interesting but challenging task to study the stability criterion in this configuration [ 17 ] .",
    "we reserve it for a separate communication .    *",
    "( d ) * the equation of state parameter @xmath41 for the effective fluid ( dark matter plus curvature fluid ) , can be obtained directly from eqs.(10 ) and ( 11 ) , which is given by @xmath42 since @xmath13 is small , effectively @xmath43 .",
    "if the total matter in the flat rotation curve region of galaxies has to be non - exotic , i.e. if the dark matter satisfies the known energy conditions , @xmath41 for the total matter content must be positive .",
    "this is achieved only if we set @xmath44 .",
    "note that our discussion is restricted only in the region of flat rotation curve of galaxies for which @xmath29 is typically between few ten kpc to few hundred kpc and as mentioned already @xmath16 is few hundred km / s .",
    "hence positive @xmath41 implies that @xmath22 is nearly zero , if not exactly .",
    "figure 1 shows that variation of @xmath41 with @xmath22 for a typical distance @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "with @xmath22 for a typical distance @xmath47 in @xmath48.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as may be seen from the figure 1 , the limit on @xmath22 is much stringent compared to the ( cosmological ) observational restriction .",
    "the equation of state of the dark matter component may be obtained by taking @xmath31 in the above equation which gives @xmath49 thus @xmath50 for dark matter implying its non - relativistic nature , which is a well known fact .",
    "further @xmath41 is positive , which means that the fluid is non - exotic . on the other hand , the equation of state of  curvature fluid is found to be @xmath51 from eq.(12 ) in the limit @xmath32 , which is a familiar result .    *",
    "( e ) * note that we can rewrite @xmath52  in the standard schwarzschild form @xmath53   ^{-1}\\ ] ] which is often convenient .",
    "such a form has the advantage that it immediately reveals not only the mass parameter @xmath54 but also shows that the proper radial length is larger than the euclidean length because @xmath55 .",
    "but most importantly , this inequality is essential for signature protection , which dictates that @xmath56 .",
    "this is a crucial condition to be satisfied by any valid metric . now , from the metric function ( 9 ) , for @xmath31 ,",
    "we get@xmath57 this implies that the essential requirement is fulfilled for this value of @xmath58 .    *",
    "( f ) * let us rewrite the metric ( 1 ) for @xmath31 under the radial rescaling@xmath59 which yields@xmath60 @xmath61 showing a surplus angle in the surface area given by @xmath62 if the probe particles were photons , so that @xmath63 , the surface area would remain _ finite _ but reduced to half of the spherical surface area @xmath64 .",
    "this is an interesting result , which distinguishes itself from that in the massless scalar field model where @xmath65 as @xmath63 [ 4 ] . for a typical rotational velocity of @xmath66 in the galactic halo region , the difference of the two surface areas @xmath67\\",

    "we plot @xmath72 vs @xmath29 .",
    "one may note that the value of @xmath72 is small .",
    "for small different values of @xmath22 , one can not distinguish the variations of @xmath72 with respect to @xmath29 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "but for higher values of @xmath22 , figure 3 shows a sharp variation of @xmath72 .",
    "note that large values of @xmath22 imply @xmath73 , i.e. , dark matter has to be exotic in nature .",
