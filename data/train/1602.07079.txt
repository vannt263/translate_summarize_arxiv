    "<S> the overbar denotes an average over all particles in the transport layer ( i.e. , located above @xmath20 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a summary of all dimensionless quantities and their meaning is shown in table  [ dimensionlessquantities ] . </S>",
    "<S> a general description of the model is presented below , see methods for the details .    </S>",
    "<S> physical arguments combined with direct simulations of cohesionless sediment transport @xcite suggest the equilibrium state close to the cessation threshold has several characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> first , the ` friction coefficient ' ( the ratio of granular shear stress and pressure , @xmath22 ) is relatively constant at the interface between the dynamic transport layer and the quasi - static sediment bed @xcite ( @xmath23 ) ( extended data figure  2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the friction coefficient @xmath24 describes the particle resistance to shear due to intergranular forces and collisions with the bed . because this resistance increases with cohesive forces , @xmath24 depends on the cohesion number @xmath25 ( methods ) . from the momentum balance within the transport layer </S>",
    "<S> , a constant friction coefficient means that the average horizontal fluid drag acceleration @xmath26 is proportional to the vertical buoyancy - reduced gravitational acceleration @xmath27 @xcite . for single particles in non - rarefied systems , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 is a well - known function of @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , averaging and rarefaction effects introduce additional dependencies on @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath22 has the functional ( @xmath33 ) form ( methods ) , @xmath34 notice that it is crucial to include rarefaction ( i.e. , large @xmath32 ) effects on the fluid drag as they can modify @xmath26 by up to an order of magnitude on triton and pluto and several orders of magnitude on comet 67p for typical conditions . due to their thin atmospheres , </S>",
    "<S> the air molecules have a mean free path that is comparable ( triton and pluto ) or much larger ( 67p ) than the particle size .    second , close to the cessation threshold , the rescaled fluid velocity above the bed ( @xmath35 ) is mostly undisturbed by particle motion and approaches a well - known function ( `` the law of the wall '' ) of the dimensionless elevation @xmath36 rescaled by the viscous length @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the average rescaled fluid velocity within the transport layer ( @xmath38 ) can then be approximated by the fluid velocity evaluated at the transport layer height @xmath39 @xmath40 where the `` the law of the wall '' velocity profile @xmath41 is defined in methods .    </S>",
    "<S> third , the scaling of the average particle velocity @xmath42 depends on the size of the transport layer . </S>",
    "<S> when the transport layer is within the viscous sublayer of the turbulent boundary layer ( @xmath43 ) , @xmath42 scales with the characteristic fluid velocity within the viscous sublayer : @xmath44 ( extended data figure  3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the transport layer extends beyond the viscous sublayer , the scale of the particle velocity is dominated by the characteristic fluid velocity in the logarithmic region of the velocity profile : @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between these two regimes is captured by a phenomenological expression obtained from transport simulations ( extended data figure  3b ) , @xmath46 } , \\label{vu}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are fitting parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> fourth , from particles vertical momentum balance , the transport layer height @xmath39 increases with the granular temperature @xmath49 , with a small offset @xmath50 due to interparticle contacts near the surface ( methods ) , @xmath51 finally , from the definition of the granular stress tensor and the constancy of the friction coefficient at the bed , the vertical and horizontal average particle velocities are found to be proportional to each other ( methods ) , @xmath52 equations ( [ meanz ] ) and ( [ tzv ] ) are consistent with data from cohesionless , non - rarefied ( @xmath53 ) transport simulations ( extended data figures  4 and 5 ) , from which @xmath54 and @xmath55 are obtained .     versus the particle reynolds number @xmath29 predicted by the analytical model ( solid lines ) and measured in water @xcite ( blue , open symbols , dashed line ) and earth s atmosphere @xcite ( brown , open symbols ) . </S>",
    "<S> simulations by the cohesionless transport model  @xcite are also shown ( filled symbols ) . the review of subaqueous threshold data by ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite reports cessation threshold values </S>",
    "<S> ( measured via extrapolation ) of numerous studies , we thus choose to represent the average and standard error ( @xmath56 confidence ) over all available measurements ( blue symbols ) . for </S>",
    "<S> water / water - oil mixtures , cohesionless predictions were used because measurements correspond to very - weak - cohesion conditions ( @xmath57 m ) as cohesive forces under water are much weaker than in dry environments due to the lack of electrostatic forces @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the model overestimates the constant value of the viscous subaqueous threshold ( measured via extrapolation @xcite ) , which is expected because hindrance effects are neglected ( supplementary online text ) . for air , </S>",
    "<S> refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xcite directly measured the threshold as the smallest values of @xmath58 below which sediment transport ceases , whereas for refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we extrapolated the threshold from measurements of the sediment transport rate . ]     as a function of the mean particle diameter @xmath6 for various planetary environments ( see methods for details . ) </S>",
    "<S> symbols correspond to measurements in earth s atmosphere @xcite and the shaded areas to regions of possible sediment transport inferred from measurements / estimations of the strongest winds occurring on the respective planetary body ( methods ) . ]    the analytical model ( eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mub1]-[tzv ] ) ) predicts the whole range of cessation thresholds obtained from cohesionless , non - rarefied transport simulations ( extended data figure  6 ) </S>",
    "<S> . it also reproduces measurements in such different conditions as water / water - oil mixtures and earth s atmosphere @xcite without fitting any model parameter to the threshold data ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ modelvsmeasurements ] ) .    when applied to various planetary environments ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ planetpredictions ] ) , we find the predictions for triton are significantly below the strongest winds estimated to occur on this moon for a large range of particle sizes . on pluto , </S>",
    "<S> the surface pressure and temperature conditions measured by new horizons 2015 @xcite result in a threshold that is at the limit of aeolian sediment transport for current estimates of the strongest winds ( methods ) . however , seasonal changes induced by its eccentric orbit and extreme axial tilt ( @xmath59 ) are likely to increase pluto s surface pressure via sublimation of nitrogen from about @xmath60pa in 2015 to at least @xmath61pa in the next 10 - 20 years @xcite . by then pluto s surface conditions are more than sufficient to sustain aeolian sediment transport ( fig .  [ planetpredictions ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the prediction for comet 67p has to be interpreted with caution because gravity on 67p decreases rapidly with the distance to its core , whereas our model assumed a constant gravity acceleration . therefore , steady sediment transport is only possible as long as the characteristic travelling height @xmath62 and length @xmath63 of fast transported particles ( methods ) are much smaller than the size of the comet ( @xmath64 km ) . </S>",
    "<S> this requirement is only fulfilled for a small range of particle sizes ( left of black dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the predicted sediment transport cessation thresholds suggest active aeolian sediment transport on triton , pluto and comet 67p , which could explain the origin of reported surface features . </S>",
    "<S> similarly to what happens on mars @xcite , the constant ejection of particles from the surface due to particle - bed impacts allows sediment transport to be sustained under relatively weak winds . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , estimated winds are usually far too weak to eject surface particles directly , and a few particles must initially enter the air flow by a mechanism distinct from wind erosion to trigger sediment transport . on comet 67p , rosetta s observations evidenced that surface particles are continuously ejected and subsequently fall back to the surface ( `` airfall '' @xcite ) . on triton , </S>",
    "<S> voyager  2 observed two geyser - like eruptions ejecting large amounts of sediment during its brief flyby @xcite . and </S>",
    "<S> even in the absence of such predominant particle - supplying mechanisms , micrometeoroid impacts eject surface particles at a regular basis , especially in low - atmospheric - density and low - gravity environments , where melting and evaporation of meteorites do not pose much of an issue . </S>",
    "<S> we conservatively estimate that about two impacts of micrometeoroids with size @xmath65 from the kuiper belt each such impact nearly guarantees the ejection of surface particles occur on pluto s surface per km@xmath66 per year ( methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is a large rate considering that the time scale associated with the alteration of pluto s youngest surface regions ( e.g. , sputnik planum ) in the absence of aeolian and fluvial processes is probably of the order of 1 - 10 million years @xcite .    the recent discovery of the `` snakeskin '' terrain on pluto ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fluid_sheared_surfaces]d ) , which shows ridges , ripples , and perhaps even barchan dunes , led to the speculation that pluto might have had a much thicker atmosphere millions of years ago @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> based on previous estimates of transport threshold , it was argued that only then it could have been possible for the wind to shape these bedforms . here , we have shown that present - orbit conditions on pluto are very likely sufficient to alter its surface via aeolian sediment transport .    </S>",
