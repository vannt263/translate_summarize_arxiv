    "mixed mode oscillations ( mmos ) , composed of well - defined periods of subthreshold oscillations ( stos ) separating spikes , appear in biological rhythms , neural dynamics , chemical oscillations , and network oscillators , with many models proposed to capture this phenomenon in these and other applications  @xcite .",
    "one question in applications is the significance of the stos  that is , do the interspike intervals ( isis ) and stos encode important information for the system ( e.g. , refs .   or  ) .",
    "an element in the answer is identifying the mechanisms that drive the stos .",
    "a challenge in this identification is that noisy time series generated by structurally different models can appear hardly distinguishable from each other , even quantitatively . experimentally observed behavior can be captured with different types of models with different noise levels , so that model identification and calibration requires consideration of several classes of models over wide parameter ranges .",
    "previous studies indicate that a minimum of three degrees of freedom is necessary to produce mmos in deterministic models ( see examples in ref .  ) , while stochastic van der pol and fitzhugh - nagumo - type models illustrate how noise can drive mmos in simple 2d models  @xcite .",
    "similarities in mmo signals often stem from an underlying hopf bifurcation and canard structure in the system  @xcite . in periods where the system is in some sense close to the hopf bifurcation ,",
    "stos can be both supported and disrupted by noise . in these models",
    "it is possible to choose parameters so that the mmos are driven by the deterministic dynamics , while for other parameter choices the appearance of mmos relies on stochastic fluctuations .    while on the one hand noise can make it difficult to distinguish between different models with various routes for producing stochastic mmos , it is nevertheless possible to use noise as a way to identify underlying mechanisms . in this paper",
    "we compare a suite of measures at different noise levels to extract the structure of the model , and thus the mechanism for the stos and mmos .",
    "the choice of measures is partly motivated by the presence of multiple time scales , an important feature that allows both well - defined periods of stos and more than one mechanism for mmo generation . as described in more detail in the next section , the common substructure of the models we consider corresponds to a subsystem with a slowly varying control parameter .",
    "depending on the combination of the other model parameters , that control parameter can slowly vary through a hopf bifurcation , in which case the sto - spike transition exhibits the dynamics of bifurcation delay ( ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "for other parameter combinations corresponding to quiescence in the deterministic system , noise excites subthreshold coherent oscillations with a frequency near that of the hopf bifurcation .",
    "the weak damping of these oscillations is due to the presence of multiple time scales , observed for parameters near a hopf bifurcation .",
    "these noise - induced stos are just one type of oscillation appearing in the context of coherence resonance ( cr ) . in its broadest sense cr",
    "is observed when a range of noise levels excites coherent oscillations in a system that is quiescent without noise , with a maximum coherence at an optimal noise level .",
    "this phenomenon is most commonly cited for transitions between steady equilibria with large excursions , such as relaxation oscillations  @xcite , but in this paper it refers to the noise - induced stos near a hb , also exhibiting cr - type behavior .",
    "whether the stos appear via slow passage through a hopf bifurcation ( sphb ) or via a cr - type mechanism , the impact of the noise on the mmos is concentrated in the interspike interval ( isi ) where the stos arise and eventually transition to a spike .",
    "it is no accident that this is also the interval where the slow dynamics are most prominent , and it is well known that noise can have a significant impact in such intervals  @xcite .",
    "the suite of measures used in this paper focuses on the stos and the isi behavior , capitalizing on previous analytical and computational studies of noise sensitivity of sphb  @xcite and cr - driven oscillations  @xcite .",
    "these previous analyses show how noise can enhance or suppress the stos through interactions with the fast - slow dynamics inherent in the mmos , and these characteristics are captured by the behavior of the suite of measures .",
    "focused on the noise sensitive stos in the isi , these measures can isolate differences between models and identify mechanisms for the mmos as noise levels and bifurcation and control parameters vary .",
    "an additional advantage of these measures is that they are based on features that are easy to analyze in time series data , making them amenable for use on experimental and simulated data .",
    "furthermore , recognition of the multiple time scales of the mmos suggests ways to experimentally introduce fluctuations into the system as a tunable extrinsic noise .",
    "when scaled appropriately by considering the isi dynamics , this extrinsic noise can be used to mimic the effects of other intrinsic noise sources .",
    "then this introduction of noise , combined with the suite of measures , can be applied both to identify the likely mechanism for mmos and limit the variety of models one must consider for calibration .",
    "* summary of results *    we use a combination of amplitude trend , isi density , and coherence measure based on power spectral density ( psd ) to classify and differentiate mechanisms for mmos .",
    "we compare phenomenological and physiological models to explore the types of sto and mmo behaviors that can be captured by simplified or reduced stochastic models over a range of noise levels .",
    "we then analyze these results within intra - model comparisons to get a deeper understanding of those mmo characteristics related to model structure , those dictated by deterministic dynamics , and those driven by noise .",
    "we focus particularly on cases where cr and/or sphb are key mechanisms . in the conclusion",
    "we give a detailed list of identifying characteristics of mmo mechanisms obtained from this suite of measures .",
    "understanding the dynamical features reveals the sensitivity in model calibration on bifurcation structure and on model choice , and illustrates ways that noise can be used to help to differentiate between models .    for stos of the cr - type",
    "we observe longer tails in the isi density together with stronger peaks in the coherence measure vs. noise , and no trend in the average sto amplitude leading up to the spike .",
    "in contrast , sphb - dominated stos have different behaviors in all three measures .",
    "simplified low dimensional integrate and fire ( if ) models can be used to capture some sto and isi behavior over a range of noise levels through adjustment of the speed of the control variable and reset .",
    "however , they can not mimic differences observed from underlying bifurcation structure , particularly in the case where a combination of cr and sphb are at play .",
    "models with voltage - dependent control variables can have a rich variety of underlying deterministic behavior , allowing possibilities for both cr- and sphb - driven mmos .",
    "these differences can drive significantly different stochastic behavior in the isi and psd behavior as compared to simple if models .",
    "related to this last observation , our analysis also illustrates how refractory dynamics , dynamics following the spike at the initial stage of the isi , can influence isi density for increasing noise , and disrupt the coherence of the stos in mmos .",
    "the influence of the reset or return mechanism , as well as the underlying deterministic behavior , observed in the measures considered here is consistent with the influence of these modeling aspects observed for noise - driven clusters of spikes , that is , repeated spikes without stos in the isi  @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : models ] we first give a brief overview of two mathematical models in the literature ",
    "one physiological , the other phenomenological  that have been used to explain mmos in neural systems , and discuss different mechanisms for mmos in these stochastic systems . in the same section we present a number of different computational measures for analyzing important characteristics of the time series in order to identify the underlying model structure . in section  [ sec : analysis_inter ] we generate and classify mmos with the physiological model and find matching mmos generated by the phenomenological model .",
    "we then apply the measures to these time series and provide a set of features that  in combination  make the time series distinguishable .",
    "[ sec : analysis_intra ] and  [ sec : intra_fhn ] focus on the comparison of time series generated by the same model with varying parameters , to further highlight differences in the computational measures that appear with different model or bifurcation structure .",
    "we also highlight the dramatic effect of weak noise on different families of mmos that are close in parameter space . in sec .",
    "[ sec : other_models ] we outline how tunable extrinsic noise can be introduced to mimic the effect of intrinsic noise , based on the inherent multiple time scales and the fact that the noise impact is concentrated in the isi .",
    "we also illustrate the applicability of our analysis to another mmo - generating model .",
    "we review the setup and dynamics of two models whose sto dynamics will be analyzed in this paper : a detailed biophysical model for mmos in stellate cells ( ` sc ' model ) as well as a modified fitzhugh - nagumo model ( ` mfn ' ) .",
    "the two main mmo - generating mechanisms in these noisy models are slow passage through a hopf bifurcation ( sphb ) and coherence resonance ( cr ) .",
    "we consider a biophysical model for the mmos observed experimentally in the layer ii stellate cells of the medial entorhinal cortex introduced in ref .  .",

    "the underlying deterministic dynamics influence different behaviors of @xmath76 as a function of noise level .",
    "systems with a supercritical hb may have underlying attracting behavior of small oscillations that can support increased coherence .",
    "this type of deterministic behavior is typically not seen for subcritical hb .",
    "\\6 . for stos dominated by sphb in the subcritical case",
    ", even very low noise levels can drive a sampling from a variety of mmo families , together with a shift and spread of isi values , making it difficult to distinguish from mmos driven by other mechanisms .",
    "in addition to identifying features related to noise level and bifurcation or slowly varying control parameters , we identified a number of additional behaviors that are related to the reset or refractory dynamics following a spike .",
    "reset and rate of increase of the control parameter in the simple if model can be varied to capture the amplitude and isi behavior of the different classes of time series in the physiological model .",
    "however , a simple if model may not have the flexibility to capture different behaviors of the coherence measure .    \\8 . for the dynamic voltage - dependent control parameters ,",
    "an early escape to spiking can translate into a lower return value . in that case the isi density does not shift with larger noise but is just less concentrated . this behavior distinguishes it from if - type models with a fixed reset or models where the return mechanisms are independent of the spike .",
    "\\9 . for return mechanisms with limited damping of stos following the spike",
    ", the coherence measure shows only a decrease in the coherence measure or no well - defined coherence over the isi .",
    "one important element in these comparisons is that characteristics of the time series , captured by the suite of measures , can change in distinct ways when the noise level is varied .",
    "a direct way of varying noise levels in neuroscience experiments is by injecting a noisy current . recognizing that the noise has its greatest impact in the isi where the slow dynamics are prominent leads to the proposal that tunable extrinsic noise can be introduced through an applied current to mimic the effects of the intrinsic noise .",
    "we show that this is indeed the case with an appropriate scaling of the noise in the physiological model .",
    "the distinctions between model features highlighted by these measures have been observed in an additional measure related to spike clusters , repeated spikes without stos in the isi  @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that the dynamic return mechanism of nlmfn , where an earlier spike can result in a reset value farther from the hb , can result in more robust stos in the isi , consistent with the isi density behavior of nlmfn .",
    "the spike cluster frequency increases much more dramatically with noise for systems with sphb - driven stos , as compared with the case where stos are cr - driven , consistent with the amplitude and isi density results observed here .",
    "also , small perturbations in the reset value can translate into a large increase in spike cluster frequency in stochastic systems , particularly where the stos are sphb - driven for an underlying subcritical hb .    our analysis in this paper is focused on a specific type of mmos , namely a combination of small amplitude oscillations and spikes relevant for neural systems .",
    "we have proposed measures that are focused on characteristics of mmos that are particularly sensitive to the noise , due to the presence of multiple scales .",
    "this suggests that understanding the presence of multiple time scales and noise - sensitive characteristics of the underlying bifurcation structures would provide a solid basis for identifying measures that characterize mmos in broader or more generic settings .",
