    "crosslinked polymer hydrogels are completely interconnected polymer networks that combine high water content with high porosity , forming macroscopic molecules that have applications in many fields .",
    "their wide range of pore sizes makes such gels ideal for separation of biological macromolecules by electrophoresis or chromatography @xcite .",
    "the crosslinking process induces a reorganization of the polymer structure , resulting in inhomogeneities in the spatial density @xcite .",
    "these inhomogeneities affect the surface configurations of the gels , but only in recent years have advances in atomic force microscopy ( afm ) made possible the imaging of soft material surfaces in an aqueous environment @xcite .",
    "the effects of the crosslinking density , temperature , pressure , and sample thickness on the surface topography have been studied by suzuki _",
    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "their results indicate that the structural features of the surface on both the micrometer and nanometer scales depend on these factors .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that control of the characteristic length scale of the gel surface using external stimuli may have applications in a variety of fields , such as regulation of adsorption and release of specific molecules by the intermolecular forces between the surface and the molecule .",
    "thus , gel surfaces provide a unique opportunity to explore the interplay between phenomena on the macroscopic and nanoscopic scales .    templated polyacrylamide gels are formed by polymerizing acrylamide with a crosslinker in the presence of a surfactant .",
    "the surfactant molecules form monodisperse micelles of a size roughly comparable with the crosslinker separation , and the presence of these micelles alters the gel pore structure , enhancing the gel s separation properties @xcite . in a recent work the surface morphology of templated polyacrylamide gels was extensively studied by afm and scaling analysis of the resulting images @xcite .",
    "this study indicates that the gel surfaces are self - affine on short length scales , with roughness ( hurst ) exponents on the order of 0.81 . in the absence of surfactant",
    "a cross - over length , above which the surface is no longer self - affine , was estimated to be on the order of 300  nm , and the saturation value of the interface width was on the order of 1  nm .",
    "both values increased dramatically with the introduction of surfactant .",
    "detailed kinetic lattice models of the polymerization of crosslinked polymer gels have previously been constructed @xcite .",
    "however , they emphasize the kinetics of polymerization and are extremely computationally intensive . inspired by the experiments reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the aim of the present work is rather to construct and study a simple continuum model that can reproduce some of the observed scaling characteristics of the templated gel surfaces at a more modest ( but still substantial ) computational cost by concentrating on the elastic structure of the gel .",

    "the model consists of a two - dimensional network of nodes interconnected by massless springs .",
    "the nodes represent crosslinker molecules , and the connecting springs represent polymer chains .",
    "the network topology consists of a triangular lattice of nodes , each of which is connected by harmonic springs to its six nearest neighbors ( except at the top and bottom surfaces , where each node has only four connections ) .",
    "the model has no excluded - volume interactions .",
    "a triangular lattice was chosen to ensure geometrical stability in two dimensions without introducing bond - angle constraints .",
    "the corresponding unrealistically high crosslinker functionality should not significantly influence our results .",
    "the network has periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal ( @xmath0 ) direction , free boundary conditions at the top ( @xmath3 ) layer , and the nodes in the bottom layer are fixed at @xmath4 , corresponding to bonding to a rigid substrate .",
    "there are @xmath5 nodes in the horizontal direction and @xmath6 nodes in the vertical direction .",
    "the total energy of the network is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , are the spring constant , the actual length , and the equilibrium length under zero external force of the @xmath11th spring , respectively .",
    "( all quantities in this paper are given in dimensionless units . )",
    "the equilibrium length of each spring is independent of the other springs and is randomly chosen with probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is proportional to the inverse of the average number of monomers between crosslinkers .",
    "this pdf corresponds to the case that the equilibrium distance between crosslinkers is proportional to the square root of an exponentially distributed number of monomers .",
    "it is consistent with the picture that crosslinkers are distributed randomly along the polymer chains , and that a spring of equilibrium length @xmath10 corresponds to a polymer of the same average end - to - end distance in the random - coil collapsed phase @xcite .",
    "the average equilibrium length of a spring is @xmath14 . in agreement with a mean - field spin - chain approximation for the elastic properties of a collapsed polymer chain @xcite",

    "that this initial configuration should not be globally stressed , we impose the condition that the average force exerted by a spring of unit length should be zero . by eq .",

    "however , the initial configuration is _ locally _ stressed , since @xmath24 for all @xmath11 while @xmath25 .",
    "the system is frustrated in the sense that there is no configuration that can simultaneously minimize the energies of all the springs . as a result",
    "there is a large number of configurations corresponding to local energy minima with similar energies .",
    "the network was relaxed using the limited - memory broyden - fletcher - goldfarb - shanno ( l - bfgs ) quasi - newton minimization algorithm @xcite until a locally stable configuration was reached , corresponding to a local minimum in the global energy landscape . by minimizing several statistically equivalent realizations of the random spring configuration",
    ", we checked that the local minima reached by this procedure are representative of typical relaxed configurations .",
    "although the total energies of different relaxed configurations were not completely identical , all the structural results were the same to within our numerical accuracy .    the l - bfgs subroutine requires the calculation of the total energy and its gradients , i.e. , the local forces in the vertical and horizontal directions for each node . by monitoring the total energy and the absolute value of the force we found that the subroutine must be called about @xmath26 times to ensure that the system reaches a local minimum",
    "since each relaxation step requires a new evaluation of the total energy and the local forces , the l - bfgs algorithm is quite computationally intensive , taking about 1 - 2 days on a current 600  mhz dual - processor pentium iii pc with 512  mb of shared memory to relax a typical system with about @xmath27 degrees of freedom .",
    "however , it was far more efficient for our application than a nave steepest - descent method , requiring about an order of magnitude less computer time while leading to essentially equivalent final energies and structures .",

    "images of a typical relaxed network are shown in figs .",

    "inhomogeneities in the spatial crosslinker density are evident in these figures .",
    "the scaling properties associated with the height fluctuations of rough surfaces have been the object of a great deal of interest .",
    "vapor deposition , epitaxial growth , polymer growth , and many other phenomena exhibit scale invariance @xcite . in a statistical sense ,",
    "the height of a single - valued self - affine random surface , @xmath1 , satisfies the scaling relation @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a dimensionless scaling parameter and @xmath30 is the so - called hurst exponent , which in this case is identical to the roughness exponent @xcite .",

    "many surfaces present a mixed behavior characterized by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a cross - over length scale separating the two behaviors .",
    "however , there exist surfaces for which the scaling can not be described by a single exponent ; instead an infinite hierarchy of characteristic exponents has to be introduced .",
    "these surfaces are called multi - affine , and they are occasionally observed in nature @xcite .",
    "molecular - beam epitaxy ( mbe ) models @xcite , polished metal surfaces @xcite , geomorphological features @xcite , and time series of financial data @xcite provide some examples of multi - affine scaling .",
    "the characteristic exponents of a multi - affine function can be calculated from the @xmath36th - order increment correlation function , defined as @xmath37 with the generalized hurst exponent @xmath38 depending continuously on @xmath36 , at least in some region of @xmath36 values .",

    "we analyzed spring networks of sizes @xmath40 . in order to simulate experimental measurements of the scaling behavior of surfaces of gels in which pores have been introduced by polymerizing acrylamide plus a crosslinker templated with surfactants that are later removed @xcite , we created voids in the networks .",
    "the voids were introduced by selecting a proportion of the nodes at random and removing these nodes and the springs associated with them .",
    "next , the hoshen - kopelman algorithm @xcite was applied to identify and discard clusters that were not connected to the fixed substrate .",
    "this last step is particularly important near the site - percolation limit , which for the triangular lattice is at a vacancy concentration of 50% @xcite .",
    "note that by  vacancy concentration \" we always mean the initial concentration of vacant nodes before removal of the disconnected clusters .",
    "the total volume fraction of the void structure resulting from the cluster removal is of course larger .",

    "these surfaces are seen to be self - affine with a hurst exponent which crosses over from near unity to approximately 0.75 at about @xmath94 . in the same figure",
    "we also show ( by thin curves ) the corresponding generalized increment correlation functions for surfaces generated from the above ones by the insertion of a finite density of vertical discontinuities .",
    "in contrast to the result for the original surfaces , the slopes of the latter curves depend on @xmath36 , indicating that the discontinuous surfaces are multi - affine .",
    "conversely , in fig .  [",
    "fig : discont](b ) we illustrate the effect of removing the discontinuities from a surface generated by our model with 0% vacancies .",
    "while the original surface is multi - affine ( signified by the @xmath36-dependent slopes ) , the surface from which the discontinuities are removed is self - affine with a hurst exponent of approximately 0.98 , corresponding to the straight line segments used to represent the polymer chains .",
    "these numerical results clearly show that the multi - affinity in our model surfaces is due to the vertical discontinuities caused by the overhangs .",
    "possible methods to improve the agreement of the scaling behavior of the model surfaces with that of the experimental system by removing the discontinuities are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "the large-@xmath55 saturation values , @xmath95 , are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : sat ] . for a fixed concentration of vacancies , the saturation value increases with increasing @xmath36 .",

    "for a given vacancy concentration , all the curves in fig .",

    "the increase in the vicinity of the percolation threshold is similar to that of @xmath95 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sat ] , except that @xmath103 has a significant background value which dominates at and below a vacancy concentration of 40% ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "thus our data indicate that both these characteristic surface lengths are coupled to the bulk connectivity length as percolation is approached",
    ". similar behavior to that observed for the saturation value of @xmath106 is also seen for the saturation value of @xmath56 .    in the templated polyacrylamide gels studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , a strong increase in the crossover length and surface width at surfactant concentrations above 20% by weight coincides with a change from an optically clear material to a white , opaque one .",
    "such a change in the light scattering intensity is consistent with an increase in the bulk correlation length from much smaller than , to on the order of the wavelength of visible light . considering the numerical and experimental evidence together ,",
    "we conclude that the dramatic increases in the surface - related length scales that occur with increasing volume fraction of voids are related to a percolation transition in the system of vacancies in the bulk , both in our model and in the experimental system by which it was inspired .",
    "in this paper we have proposed and studied a simple frustrated spring - network model which , with a relatively modest computational effort , reproduces aspects of the scaling behavior of the surfaces of surfactant - templated polyacrylamide gels , recently observed in afm experiments @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that simple models that incorporate elastic properties of the gel can provide a useful framework for understanding the structural characteristics of these materials , which are otherwise extremely difficult to simulate due to their complexity .",
    "the main similarities and differences between the surface structures of the model and the experimental system are as follows . _",
    "the main similarity _ is a nontrivial scaling behavior corresponding to a power - law form of the increment correlation function at small and intermediate length scales .",
    "this power - law behavior terminates at a crossover length scale , above which the rms surface width and the increment correlation functions both reach saturation values that appear to be independent of the system size . the origin of this crossover behavior is explained in terms of the structural inhomogeneities of the gel . on large",
    "length scales the scaling behavior reflects the average network structure , while on small length scales the microscopic density fluctuations of the gel network play the most important role .",
    "the quantitative dependence of the crossover on the bulk vacancy concentration is discussed further below . _ the main difference _ between the model and the experimental surfaces lies in the details of the scaling behavior at length scales below the crossover length : the model surfaces are multi - affine , while the experimental surfaces are self - affine .",
    "the multi - affinity in the model is caused by the finite density of vertical discontinuities in the simulated surfaces ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : zooms ] ) , which are not seen in the experimental system ( see fig .  7 of ref .",
    "the discontinuities in the simulated surfaces as they are defined here result from overhangs in the spring configuration at the surface , and modification of the model to improve the detailed agreement with the scaling behavior of the experimental system should aim at eliminating these overhangs .",
    "( it is also possible that overhangs do in fact exist in the undisturbed experimental surfaces , but are so mechanically weak that they are smoothed out by the force of the afm tip . ) in the model , the number and size of overhangs could be reduced or eliminated in several ways .",
    "one possibility is to simulate the smoothing action of the afm tip , _",
    "e.g. _ , by a running - average method .",
    "another possibility is to include a weak gravitational field ( the specific gravity of the polymers is greater than that of water ) , which would bend overhanging sections down into the main part of the interface .",
    "it should also be noted that the larger coordination number in three dimensions most likely would reduce the importance of overhangs in a three - dimensional version of the model , even without further modifications .",
    "( extension to three dimensions would also reduce the number of disconnected pieces , which are partly responsible for the large overhangs seen in the case of high vacancy densities .",
    "however , the computational cost would be large . )",
    "a more exhaustive numerical and analytical study of the influence of discontinuities on surface scaling behavior is currently underway @xcite .",
    "the experimental surfactant templating was simulated by introducing a nonzero volume fraction of voids in the network through deleting lattice nodes and their associated springs .",
    "both the horizontal crossover length and the vertical surface thickness ( as measured by the saturation values of both the rms surface width and the generalized increment correlation functions ) increase dramatically as the vacancy concentration approaches the site - percolation limit of @xmath107% .",
    "an analogous increase of the characteristic horizontal and vertical length scales with surfactant concentration is observed in the experimental system , where it coincides with a dramatic increase in the optical opacity .",
    "the numerical results for our model thus support the hypothesis that this increase in the experimental system is caused by a percolation transition of the voids created by removal of the surfactants .    in conclusion , despite the differences in the details of the scaling behavior at small and intermediate length scales , our simplified random - spring model successfully mimics several of the surface characteristics of an important new class of porous media , including the dramatic increase in surface roughness that occurs with increasing surfactant concentration .",
    "efforts to further improve the agreement between the small - scale scaling behavior of our theoretical model and that of the experimental system by which it was inspired are left for future study .",
    "these efforts should in particular involve investigations of the dependence of the scaling properties of the model on external forces due to gravity or the afm tip , as well as on the statistics of the local spring distribution and the dimensionality of the model .",

    "<S> _ , e - print cond - mat/0112255 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the gel is represented by a frustrated , triangular network of nodes connected by springs of random equilibrium lengths . </S>",
    "<S> the nodes represent crosslinkers , and the springs correspond to polymer chains . </S>",
    "<S> the boundaries are fixed at the bottom , free at the top , and periodic in the lateral direction . </S>",
    "<S> voids are introduced by deleting a proportion of the nodes and their associated springs . </S>",
    "<S> the model is numerically relaxed to a representative local energy minimum , resulting in an inhomogeneous , `` clumpy '' bulk structure . </S>",
    "<S> the free top surface is defined at evenly spaced points in the lateral ( @xmath0 ) direction by the height of the topmost spring , measured from the bottom layer , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> its scaling properties are studied by calculating the root - mean - square surface width and the generalized increment correlation functions @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the surface is found to have a nontrivial scaling behavior on small length scales , with a crossover to scale - independent behavior on large scales . </S>",
    "<S> as the vacancy concentration approaches the site - percolation limit , both the crossover length and the saturation value of the surface width diverge in a manner that appears to be proportional to the bulk connectivity length . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that a percolation transition in the bulk also drives a similar divergence observed in surfactant templated polyacrylamide gels at high surfactant concentrations . </S>"
