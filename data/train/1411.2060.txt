    "quantum confined model systems incorporating different repulsive or attractive potential terms have become the subject of increasing research interest @xcite .",
    "a number experiments involving , e.g. atoms and molecules under pressure , quantum dots , and atoms in metallofullerenes , are analysed using such models , which are essentially defined by the given shape and strength of the confining potential .",
    "further , the confined model potentials have been used to study the autoionization resonance states for the two - electron spherical quantum dots @xcite and two electron atomic states @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of confined systems generate valuable guidelines to the design and synthesis of new materials and future devices .",
    "it is therefore of interest to derive new exact solutions of the quantum model systems involving such confining potentials under certain special conditions .",
    "0.1true in we revisit a model by m. taut @xcite for a two - electron system in which the electrons are softly confined by means of oscillator potentials .",
    "we shall consider the problem in @xmath1 spatial dimensions and find exact solutions for certain special choices of the parameters , and accurate numerical solutions in other cases .",
    "we shall also study this system when it is confined to an impenetrable spherical box of radius @xmath2 in @xmath3 we shall refer to this as ` hard confinement ' , which persists even when the oscillator interaction is switched off .",
    "thus we shall begin with only soft confinement in form of an attractive oscillator , and we go on later to implement hard confinement by applying to the same system a vanishing boundary condition at the surface of a finite sphere of radius @xmath0 0.1true in in order to place our work in perspective , we shall present here a brief review on the confined @xmath4-dimensional h atom @xmath5 and the isotropic harmonic oscillator @xmath6 .",
    "the eigenspectrum of the spherically confined h atom ( scha ) within impenetrable walls is characterized by novel degeneracy @xcite effects of three different kinds .",
    "two of them are generated from the specific choice of the radius of confinement @xmath2 , chosen exactly at the radial nodes corresponding to the free hydrogen atom ( fha ) wave functions . in the _ incidental degeneracy _",
    "case , the confined @xmath7 state with the principal quantum number @xmath8 is iso - energic with @xmath9 state of the fha with energy @xmath10 atomic units ( a.u . ) , at an @xmath2 defined by the radial node in the fha .",
    "for example , the @xmath7 state corresponding to the lowest energy value , when confined at the radius @xmath2 given by the radial node the first excited _ free _ state @xmath9 , increases in such a way that the confined - state energy becomes the same as excited free - state energy .",
    "the specific node in question is given by @xmath11 .",
    "such a degeneracy can be realized at similar choices for @xmath2 where multiple nodes exist in the second and higher excited states of a given @xmath12",
    ". however , such closed analytical expressions for the radial nodes are not available in the case of higher excited states . in the _ simultaneous - degeneracy _ case , on the other hand , for all @xmath13 ,",
    "each pair of confined states denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath14 state , confined at the common @xmath11 , become degenerate .",
    "note that the pair of levels in the free state are nondegenerate .",
    "both these degeneracies have been shown @xcite to result from the gauss relationship applied at a unique @xmath15 by the confluent hypergeometric functions that describe the general solutions of the scha problem .",
    "0.1true in finally , the interdimensional degeneracy @xcite arises , as in the case of the free hydrogen atom , due to the invariance of the schrdinger equation under the transformation @xmath16 . in order to preserve the number of nodes in the radial function , it is necessary simultaneously to make the transformation @xmath17 .",
    "the _ incidental degeneracy _ observed in the case of a spherically confined isotropic harmonic oscillator ( sciho ) is qualitatively similar to that of the scha .",
    "for example , the only radial node in the first excited free state of any given @xmath12 for @xmath4-dimensional sciho is located at @xmath18 . for the multiple node states ,",
    "the corresponding numerical values must be used .",
    "however , the behavior of the two confined states at a common radius of confinement is found to be interestingly different @xcite . in particular , for the sciho the pairs of the confined states defined by @xmath19 and @xmath20 at the common @xmath18 a.u .",
    ", display for all @xmath8 , a constant energy separation of _ exactly _ @xmath21 harmonic - oscillator units ,  @xmath22 , with the state of higher @xmath23 corresponding to the lower energy .",
    "it is interesting to note that the two confined states at the common @xmath2 with @xmath24 , considered above contain different numbers of radial nodes .",
    "the condition for interdimensional degeneracy@xcite due to the invariance of the schrdinger equation remains the same as before .",
    "recently , the confined systems of the @xmath4-dimensional hydrogen atom @xcite and harmonic oscillator @xcite have been studied .",
    "problems involving short - range potentials in @xmath4 dimensions have recently been considered @xcite . in the light of the above discussion , it is interesting to study the various aforementioned degeneracies in the free and spherically confined @xmath4-dimensional potential generally given by @xmath25 .",
    "we consider now the model potential of our interest in the present work . for a single particle the @xmath4-dimensional schrdinger equation , in atomic units @xmath26 , with a spherically symmetric potential @xmath27",
    "can be written as the following @xmath28\\psi(r)=e\\psi(r),\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the @xmath4-dimensional laplacian operator and @xmath30 .",
    "if the positions of two particles are @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the hamiltonian for the system in which the particles interact by means of a repulsive coulomb term but are bound by oscillators is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 . by using a pair - distance",
    "coordinate @xmath36 and a center - of - mass coordinate @xmath37 , the hamiltonian @xmath38 and potential @xmath39 for relative motion can be expressed in terms of @xmath40 and @xmath41 and may be written @xmath42 in order to transform ( [ eq1 ] ) to the @xmath4-dimensional spherical coordinates @xmath43 , we first separate variables @xcite using the representation @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a normalized spherical harmonic with characteristic value @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "one then obtains the radial schrdinger equation in the form @xmath48u(r)=0,\\quad\\quad",
    "\\int_0^\\infty u^2(r)dr=1 , u(0)=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath49 .",
    "since the spherical - harmonic factor @xmath50 has definite parity @xcite given by @xmath51 and the interaction in the present model does not depend on spin , the configuration - space wave function @xmath52 can be multiplied by a two - particle spin factor with complementary permutation symmetry ( singlet or triplet ) so that the overall wave function for relative motion is antisymmetric under the exchange of the particle indices . a center - of - mass factor",
    "@xmath53 will not change this symmetry since it is in any case symmetric .",
    "thus in the present model , all possible energy eigenstates must be considered for the two - body system in configuration space .",
    "we assume that the potential @xmath27 is less singular than the centrifugal term so that @xmath54 we note that the hamiltonian and boundary conditions of ( [ eq3 ] ) are invariant under the transformation @xmath55 thus , given any solution for fixed @xmath4 and @xmath56 , we can immediately generate others for different values of @xmath4 and @xmath57 more particularly , the energy is unchanged if both @xmath58 and the number of nodes @xmath59 are held constant .",
    "repeated application of this transformation produces a large collection of states , the only apparent limitation being a lack of interest in some values of @xmath4 ( see , for example @xcite ) . in the present work , we consider the repulsive coulomb plus a harmonic - oscillator potential @xmath60 where @xmath61 , and the coefficients @xmath62 and @xmath63 are both constant .",
    "when we look at hard confinement inside a sphere of finite radius @xmath2 , we can also consider removing the oscillator binding by choosing @xmath64 : in both cases of confinement , the spectrum of @xmath38 is entirely discrete .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we discuss some general spectral features and bounds . in section  3",
    "we express the repulsive coulomb potential term @xmath65 as the envelope of a family @xmath66 of potential terms each of which admits an exact analytical solution .",
    "this application of envelope theory @xcite leads to a spectral upper bound formula valid for all the soft - confined eigenvalues . in section  4",
    "we briefly review the asymptotic iteration method ( aim ) for solving a second - order linear differential equation .",
    "we also discuss necessary and sufficient conditions for certain classes of differential equations with polynomial coefficients to have polynomial solutions . in sections 5 and 6",
    ", we use aim to study how the eigenvalues depend on the potential parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in each of these sections ,",
    "the results obtained are of two types : exact analytic results that are valid when certain parametric constraints are satisfied , and accurate numerical values for arbitrary sets of potential parameters . in section 5",
    "there is only soft confinement effected by a non - zero oscillator term ; in section 6 we consider ` hard confinement ' , that is to say when the same system is confined to the interior of an impenetrable spherical box of radius @xmath0",
    "we shall show shortly that the hamiltonian @xmath38 is bounded below .",
    "indeed provided that @xmath63 or @xmath69 , the entire spectrum is discrete .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath38 may therefore be characterized variationally .",
    "we first discuss the open system where @xmath70 the eigenvalues @xmath71 are monotonic in each parameter @xmath67 and @xmath68 as a direct consequence of the monotonicity of the potential @xmath39 in these parameters .",
    "indeed , since @xmath72 and @xmath73 , it follows from the hellmann - feynman theorem that @xmath74 elementary scaling arguments can be used to reduce the dimension of the parametric space .",
    "for example we obtain @xmath75    the generalized heisenberg uncertainty relation may be expressed @xcite for dimension @xmath76 as the operator inequality @xmath77 this allows us to construct the following lower energy bound @xmath78.\\ ] ] provided @xmath79 this lower bound is finite for all @xmath67 .",
    "it also obeys the same scaling and monotonicity laws as @xmath80 itself .",
    "but the bound is weak . for potentials such as @xmath27 that satisfy @xmath81 common",
    "has shown @xcite for the ground state in @xmath82 dimensions that @xmath83 but the resulting energy lower bound is still weak .",
    "lower and upper bounds on the ground - state energy @xmath80 are provided in @xmath4 dimensions , for example , by a gaussian trial wave function @xmath84 used here in two distinct ways . by the local energy theorem",
    "@xcite we have ( for @xmath85 initially sufficiently small ) we find the lower energy bound : @xmath86 = \\max_{0<\\alpha<\\alpha_1}\\,\\min_{r>0}\\,\\left[-\\alpha^2 r^2 + \\alpha d + \\frac{a}{r } + b^2\\,r^2\\right].\\ ] ] meanwhile , if the constant @xmath87 is chosen so that normalization ( apart from the angular terms ) , is provided by @xmath88 then by the rayleigh - ritz theorem , we obtain the upper bound @xmath89.\\ ] ] these bounds also bound the bottoms of the angular - momentum subspaces labelled by @xmath12 : this is a consequence of the degeneracies between the states with the same value of @xmath90 , as we have mentioned above : practically speaking , if @xmath91 one can increase @xmath4 to @xmath92 and set @xmath93 in order to use the bound formulas ( [ elet],[err ] ) for the energies . for the @xmath4-dimensional oscillator @xmath94",
    ", we observe that the @xmath4-dimensional bounds coalesce to the exact energy @xmath95= db.$ ] a specific example is provided by the case @xmath96 and @xmath97 for which we find @xmath98 where the accurate estimate @xmath80 was found numerically , by shooting methods .",
    "more generally , we shall sometimes use the convention of atomic physics in which , even for non - coulombic central potentials , a ` principal quantum number ' @xmath8 is used and defined by @xmath99    now we turn to the case of hard confinement @xmath100 and we write @xmath101 the monotonicity with respect to the box size @xmath2 may be proved by a variational argument .",
    "let us consider two box sizes , @xmath102 and an angular momentum subspace labelled by a fixed @xmath57 we extend the domains of the wave functions in the finite - dimensional subspace spanned by the first @xmath103 radial eigenfunctions for @xmath104 so that the new space @xmath105 may be used to study the case @xmath106 .",
    "we do this by defining the extended eigenfunctions so that @xmath107 for @xmath108 we now look at @xmath38 in @xmath105 with box size @xmath109 .",
    "the minima of the energy matrix @xmath110 $ ] are the exact eigenvalues for @xmath111 and , by the rayleigh - ritz principle , these values are one - by - one upper bounds to the eigenvalues for @xmath112 thus , by formal argument we deduce what is perhaps intuitively clear , that the eigenvalues increase as @xmath2 is decreased , that is to say @xmath113 if a very special box is now considered , whose size @xmath2 coincides with any radial node of the corresponding @xmath114 problem , then these two problems share an eigenvalue exactly .",
    "this is an example of a very general relation which exists between constrained and unconstrained eigensystems , and , indeed , also between two constrained systems with different box sizes .",
    "we first consider the radial eigenvalue problem for a generalized harmonic oscillator we have @xmath115u(r)=eu(r),\\quad\\quad e = ( 4n + 2\\lambda+3)b,\\ ] ] where @xmath116 and @xmath117 thus , for example , in @xmath1 dimensions , we have @xmath118 experience with the envelope method @xcite suggests that we express the repulsive coulomb term @xmath65 as the envelope of a family of curves of the form @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the point of contact between the target @xmath121 and a tangential curve @xmath122 the idea behind this is to think of @xmath65 as a smooth transformation @xmath123 of @xmath124 whose tangents @xmath125 all lie above @xmath65 because @xmath126 is concave ; meanwhile the tangential potentials are schrdinger  soluble . in order to find the coefficients @xmath85 and @xmath127 we require at contact point @xmath128 that @xmath129 and @xmath125 agree in value and slope .",
    "thus we have @xmath130 meanwhile , since @xmath131 is concave , we know that each tangential curve lies above @xmath129 , that is to say @xmath132 the geometrical situation is illustrated for the problem at hand in fig .",
    "[ figenv ] .     in the potential",
    "is represented as the envelope of an upper family of tangential potentials @xmath133 . when a tangential potential @xmath125 is used in place of @xmath129 ,",
    "schrdinger s equation is exactly soluble . in the envelope method",
    ", the best choice is made by optimizing over the point of contact @xmath134 . ]    in order to obtain the upper energy bound it remains to replace the coulomb term in by the right side of and solve the resulting equation for the energy , shifted by @xmath135 we first determine @xmath136 from the equation @xmath137 the final expression for this bound is as follows : @xmath138^{\\half } + \\frac{ab}{2t}.\\ ] ] the function @xmath139 is u - shaped with one minimum that is easy to find .",
    "what we have in effect is a continuous family of upper bounds , and the minimization in selects the best of these for the given parameter set and eigenvalue .    for the ground state with @xmath140",
    "we obtain the higher bound @xmath141 than the @xmath142 provided by a scale - optimized gaussian trial function in , but of course the simple general formula is valid for every eigenvalue . by using aim",
    "we shall find very accurate numerical eigenvalues for soft confinement in section  5 , where some are tabulated in table  [ table : difdn3 ] .",
    "we exhibit now two more upper bounds otained by , along with accurate values in parentheses from table  [ table : difdn3 ] : @xmath143 ; @xmath144",
    "the asymptotic iteration method ( aim ) was originally introduced @xcite to investigatae the solutions of differential equations of the form @xmath145 where @xmath146 and @xmath147 are @xmath148differentiable functions .",
    "a key feature of this method is to note the invariant structure of the right - hand side of ( [ eq5 ] ) under further differentiation . indeed ,",
    "if we differentiate ( [ eq5 ] ) with respect to @xmath149 , we obtain @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 if we find the second derivative of equation ( [ eq5 ] ) , we obtain @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 thus , for @xmath156 and @xmath157 derivative of ( [ eq5 ] ) , @xmath158 , we have @xmath159 and @xmath160 respectively , where @xmath161 from ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) we have @xmath162 clearly , from ( [ eq11 ] ) if @xmath163 , the solution of ( [ eq5 ] ) , is a polynomial of degree @xmath59 , then @xmath164 .",
    "further , if @xmath165 , then @xmath166 for all @xmath167 . in an earlier paper @xcite we proved the principal theorem of aim , namely 0.1 in    * theorem  1  @xcite . *",

    "_ 0.1true in recently , it has been shown @xcite that the termination condition ( [ eq13 ] ) is necessary and sufficient for the differential equation ( [ eq5 ] ) to have polynomial - type solutions of degree at most @xmath59 , as we may conclude from eq.([eq11 ] ) . thus , using theorem 1 , we can now find the necessary and sufficient conditions @xcite for the polynomial solutions of the differential equation @xmath176 where @xmath177 are constants .",
    "these conditions have been reported in the following theorem : 0.1true in * theorem 2  [ @xcite theorem 5 ] . *    in the next sections , we shall apply the result of theorem  2 to study the possible quasi - exact analytic solutions for the @xmath4-dimension schrdinger equation ( [ eq3 ] ) for unconstrained and constrained coulomb plus harmonic oscillator potential ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "we shall also apply aim , theorem  1 , to obtain _ accurate _",
    "approximations for arbitrary potential parameters , again , for the unconstrained and constrained @xmath4-dimensional schrdinger equation ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we consider the @xmath4-dimensional schrdinger equation @xmath178u_{nl}^d(r)=e_{nl}^d u_{nl}^d(r),\\quad 0<r<\\infty.\\ ] ] in order to solve this equation by means of aim , the first step is to transform ( [ eq25 ] ) into the standard form ( [ eq5 ] ) . to this end",
    ", we note that the differential equation ( [ eq25 ] ) has one regular singular point at @xmath179 and an irregular singular point at @xmath180 .",
    "since for large @xmath149 , the harmonic oscillator term dominates , the asymptotic solution of ( [ eq25 ] ) as @xmath181 is @xmath182 ; meanwhile the indicial equation of ( [ eq25 ] ) at the regular singular point @xmath183 yields @xmath184 which is solved by @xmath185 the value of @xmath186 , in eq.([eq26 ] ) , determines the behavior of @xmath187 for @xmath188 , and only @xmath189 is acceptable , since only in this case is the mean value of the kinetic energy finite @xcite .",
    "thus , the exact solution of ( [ eq25 ] ) may assume the form @xmath190 where we note that @xmath191 as @xmath188 . on substituting this ansatz wave function into ( [ eq25 ] )",
    ", we obtain the differential equation for @xmath192 as @xmath193 this equation has a regular singular point at @xmath183 with exponents @xmath194 and an irregular point at infinity .",
    "we may note first that is a special case of the differential equation ( [ eq21 ] ) with @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "thus , the necessary condition for the polynomial solutions of eq.([eq28 ] ) is @xmath200 and the sufficient condition follows from the vanishing of the tridiagonal determinant @xmath201 , @xmath202 , namely    @xmath203  =     [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ table : difdn5 ]",
    "we study a model atom - like system @xmath204 which is confined softly by the inclusion of a harmonic - oscillator potential term @xmath205 and possibly also by the presence of an impenetrable spherical box of radius @xmath0 for @xmath206 or @xmath207 the entire spectrum @xmath208 is discrete .",
    "we have studied these eigenvalues and we present an approximate spectral formula for the ` free ' case , @xmath209 . for",
    "the general case of @xmath210 aim has been used to provide both a large number of exact analytical solutions , valid for certain special choices of the parameters @xmath211 and also very accurate numerical eigenvalues for arbitrary parametric data . in the cases where we have found analytic solutions for @xmath114 ,",
    "the exact wave functions are no longer expressed in terms of known special functions , as is possible for the hydrogen atom . however , the exact solutions we have found for confining potentials correspond to confinement at the zeros of the unconfined case .",
    "an interesting qualitative feature seems to be that @xmath208 , for large @xmath2 , is concave with respect to @xmath59 , @xmath12 , or @xmath4 , but becomes convex as @xmath2 is reduced ; this may arise because the reduction in @xmath2 perturbs the higher states more severely since , when free , they are naturally more spread out .",
    "it is hoped that the work reported in the present paper will provide a useful addition to the growing body of results concerning the spectra of confined atomic systems in @xmath4 dimensions .",
