    "supernovae of type ia ( sneia ) are uniquely suited for the calibration of the hubble constant @xmath16 because they are accessible out to large distances , and as the best standard candles known they are insensitive to selection ( malmquist ) bias , which has beset the extragalactic distance scale for so long .",
    "an hst program to determine the hubble constant @xmath16 using type ia supernovae ( sneia ) as standard candles was therefore mounted in 1990 at the time when hst was launched .",
    "the plan was to determine cepheid distances of nearby galaxies which had produced well observed sneia , and to compare their resulting mean absolute magnitudes with the apparent magnitudes of sneia out to @xmath17 ( in the present context referred to as `` distant '' sneia ) .",
    "this velocity distance is ideal for the determination of the - large - scale value of @xmath16(cosmic ) because it is large enough that any noise in the hubble flow due to random velocities and local streaming motions of galaxies is negligible compared with the systematic redshift itself , and on the other hand is small enough that cosmological effects are also negligible ( except for small @xmath18-corrections , see below ) .",
    "the program progressed step by step . by 2001",
    "we had published with our collaborators the cepheid distances of eight sneia - bearing galaxies ( for references see * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  iv ) .",
    "four additional cepheid distances of such galaxies are due to other authors .",
    "thus cepheid distances are now available for 12 sneia of which , however , two are spectroscopically peculiar .    yet",
    "at least four originally unforeseen developments have made it necessary to put the present summary paper on @xmath16 on a broader basis , which we have prepared in four preceding papers ( @xcite , hereafter paper  i ; @xcite , hereafter paper  ii ; @xcite , hereafter paper  iii ; and @xcite , hereafter paper iv ) .",
    "the four developments are as follows :    \\(1 ) the uniformity of sneia .",
    "while some pushed snei @xcite , or particularly sneia @xcite as standard candles with the then available observations , others emphasized their variety @xcite .",
    "eventually @xcite proposed a correlation between the decline rate @xmath19 ( the magnitude change during the first 15 days past @xmath1 maximum ) and the absolute magnitude at maximum .",
    "the quantitative correlation became convincing when @xcite showed that the magnitude residuals from the hubble diagram regression ( hubble line ) are a function of @xmath19 .",
    "there remained some debate between different authors as to the steepness of the correlation .",
    "but this is now understood as the result of different assumptions on the intrinsic color of sneia ; the @xmath19 correction on the magnitudes is therefore quite well controlled ( @xcite ) , but remains purely empirical .",
    "it became also increasingly clear that spectroscopically peculiar sneia can not be used as standard candles .",
    "the magnitude of normal sneia after correction for @xmath19 show a scatter about the hubble line of @xmath20 ( including errors of the absorption corrections ; the _ intrinsic _ scatter is demonstrably @xmath21 ) . without the @xmath19 correction a scatter of @xmath22",
    "would be observed which shows  contrary to occasional claims  that even without the @xmath19 correction sneia are highly competitive standard candles .",
    "the @xmath19 corrections do not only affect the observed magnitude scatter , but also the calibration of @xmath16 at the level of 5% because the calibrating sneia have systematically smaller @xmath19 values than the distant sneia .",
    "[ this is because cepheids require galaxies with a young population , and the sneia in such galaxies , i.e.  in spirals as contrasted to the ellipticals , tend to have small @xmath19 as first pointed out by @xcite ] . ",
    "it is self - understood that the calibration of @xmath16 requires a large sample of uniformly reduced distant sneia ; this was compiled in @xcite .",
    "the large size of the sample is due to the heroic effort of many observers who have collected the necessary photometry over the years .",
    "\\(2 ) the difference of the @xmath23-@xmath24 relation of cepheids in the galaxy and in lmc . in paper",
    "i & ii it was shown that not only do the galactic period - color ( @xmath23-@xmath25 ) relations in @xmath26 and @xmath27 have different slopes than in the lmc , but  as a necessary consequence  the period - luminosity ( @xmath23-@xmath24 ) relations in @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 have different slopes , and hence different luminosities at given periods , in the two galaxies .",
    "confirmation , among other indicators , is that the lightcurve shape at a given period differ between cepheids in the galaxy and the lmc @xcite .",
    "this came as a rather unexpected complication for the determination of cepheid distances .",
    "it requires that the @xmath23-@xmath24 relations of the two galaxies must be based on independent zero - points .",
    "an update of the zero - points adopted in paper  ii and iv and their errors is given in ",
    "[ sec : h0cosmic : error ]  ( 2b ) .",
    "the inequality of the @xmath23-@xmath24 relations raises a deep problem : which relation , or an interpolation between them , is to be used for a particular galaxy ?",
    "\\(3 ) in @xcite it was decided to determine _ two _ cepheid distances for each snia host galaxies , once @xmath28(gal ) with the @xmath23-@xmath24 relation of the relatively metal - rich galactic cepheids , and once @xmath28(lmc ) with the @xmath23-@xmath24 relation of the metal - poor lmc cepheids , and then to interpolate  and slightly extrapolate  between the two values according to metallicity , expressed by the new [ o / h ] scale of @xcite , hereafter denoted by @xmath29_{\\rm sakai}$ ] .",
    "the resulting moduli @xmath30 are in this way corrected for metallicity , provided the full difference between the galactic and lmc @xmath23-@xmath24 relation is in fact caused by metallicity differences . in @xcite only part of the difference between @xmath28(gal ) and @xmath28(lmc ) could be proved to be caused by the line blanketing effect of metal lines , but most of the difference could not be explained .",
    "thus it remained a hypothesis that _ all _ of the difference is due to metallicity variations .    perhaps the first to predict that the position of the edges of the cepheid instability strip is",
    "a function of chemical composition ( in its effect on the atmospheric opacity ) was john cox ( @xcite ; @xcite , eq .",
    "the sense was that the strip boundaries move bluewards with decreasing @xmath31 , yet redwards with decreasing @xmath32 .",
    "hence , for a particular @xmath33 , if @xmath32 increases with increasing @xmath31 , there will be compensation in the @xmath34 instability line , and the strip boundary is in this case almost independent of variable @xmath32 and @xmath31 for that value of @xmath33 . among the first to calculate the effect",
    "were @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the modern models of @xcite to show that the effects of @xmath32 and @xmath31 nearly compensate when @xmath35 ( see eq .",
    "50 of @xcite ) .",
    "the situation has become much clearer due to recent model calculations by @xcite and @xcite who show that the strip moves bluewards with decreasing @xmath31 , irrespective of any reasonable value of @xmath32 .",
    "the models of @xcite can match the observed @xmath23-@xmath24 relation of lmc , _ including its break at @xmath36 _ , impressively well , except that the model colors @xmath27 are still too red by @xmath37 at the long periods ( @xmath38 ) needed for cepheids outside the local group .",
    "a corresponding color difference persists for @xmath39 also between the observed and theoretical galactic @xmath23-@xmath24 relations in @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "yet the main point here is that the shift of the instability strip to higher temperatures with decreasing metallicity is no longer a hypothesis , but is predicted by model calculations .",
    "empirical support for the metallicity corrections comes from comparing the resulting @xmath40 of 37 galaxies in @xcite with independent trgb distances , as far as available , and with velocity distances . the distances @xmath41 and @xmath42 show no significant dependence on [ o / h ] .",
    "a clear dependence does arise , however , if @xmath28(gal ) or @xmath28(lmc ) were used instead of @xmath40 . also the strong metal dependence of the snia luminosities based on @xmath28(lmc ) becomes insignificant if @xmath40 is used instead ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ten nearby galaxies with cepheid distances that have hosted normal sneia carry metallicity corrections , which were found ( @xcite ) to depend not only on the metallicity , but also on the mean period of the cepheids .",
    "the corrections vary for @xmath28(gal ) between @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and for @xmath28(lmc ) between @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "mean _ corrections are @xmath47 for @xmath28(gal ) and @xmath48 for @xmath28(lmc ) . the small mean correction in case of @xmath28(gal )",
    "is due to the fact that the mean metallicity of [ o / h]@xmath49 of the ten calibrating galaxies is close to the metallicity of the galactic cepheids ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "( the notation [ o / h]@xmath51 is explained in   [ sec : data ] ) .",
    "therefore , if one is prepared to accept the simplifying premise that the distances of metal - rich cepheids should be based on the @xmath23-@xmath24 relation of the metal - rich galactic cepheids  without any further metallicity correction ",
    "one obtains on average a good approximation ( to within @xmath52 or 1% in distance ) to the adopted @xmath40 of the calibrators , and hence to the mean luminosity of their sneia .",
    "\\(4 ) a new photometric zero - point of the hst wfpc2 camera was determined in @xcite .",
    "it affects six of the present calibrators by @xmath53 to @xmath54 depending on the chip and the epoch of observation .",
    "the photometric zero - point of the remaining four galaxies was estimated to deviate by not more than @xmath55 .",

    "it is not meaningful to compare the present calibration of @xmath102 ( unweighted ) or @xmath5 ( weighted ) with previous authors , because different authors have used different precepts concerning intrinsic color , color excess , and absorption - to - reddening ratio @xmath103 ; some of the published values are also normalized to different values of the decline rate @xmath19 and the intrinsic color @xmath104 . since these precepts have little effect on @xmath0 as long as they are consistently applied to the nearby calibrating sneia and those defining the hubble diagram , it is more realistic to compare the values of @xmath0 from different authors .",

    "sec : h0cosmic : previous ] .",
    "to further ensure the homogeneity of the sn sample , their magnitudes @xmath98 are plotted against various parameters in figure  [ fig:02 ] .",

    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig:02 ] there are no significant trends , with the only exception of the weighted solution of @xmath98 versus [ o / h]@xmath51 , which suggests a correlation at only the @xmath106 level .",
    "we take the magnitude difference of @xmath107 ( unweighted ) or @xmath108 ( weighted ) between the five sneia in metal - poor galaxies and their counterparts in metal - rich galaxies as insignificant , because it depends entirely on the assigned weights .",
    "it would therefore be arbitrary to exclude one or more sneia from the sample on the basis of any of the parameters considered .",
    "the value of @xmath0(cosmic ) is obtained by combining the intercept @xmath109 of the hubble line defined by distant sneia with the mean absolute magnitude of the ten calibrating sneia .",

    "the close agreement of @xmath0 in all three colors speaks in favor of the _ consistent _ absorption corrections applied to the calibrators and distant sneia in @xcite .",
    "this is also seen in table  [ tab:05 ] , where the mean intrinsic colors ( after correction for galactic and internal reddening ) of the two sets of sneia are compared .",
    "their agreement is as good as can be expected .",
    "the color agreement between calibrators and distant sneia is of greatest importance .",
    "if it had not been the case it would have implied that one set of sneia had systematically larger absorption corrections than the other .",
    "a biased value of @xmath0 would be the result .",
    "other intrinsic colors and hence absorption corrections have been adopted by previous authors .",
    "this is unconsequential for @xmath0 as long as the absorption corrections are consistent .",
    "but it precludes a comparison of the present values of @xmath109 with previous authors .      as mentioned before the mean decline rate @xmath19 of the calibrators is for good reasons smaller than that of the distant sneia ( see also table  [ tab:05 ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath0 depends therefore somewhat on the adopted @xmath19 corrections .",
    "although the former disagreement between the corrections by different authors are now essentially understood ( @xcite ) , it is interesting to see the effect on @xmath0 if the distant sneia with @xmath125 are omitted . in that case",
    "the remaining 40 distant sneia have exactly the same @xmath126 as the calibrators .",
    "they yield @xmath127 and hence @xmath128 .",
    "an alternative sample restriction is to dispense with the @xmath19 corrections altogether and to require  since the snia luminosity is also a function of the type @xmath129 of the parent galaxy ( as defined in @xcite ; see fig .",
    "10 there )  the mean type @xmath129 of the parent galaxies be the same for the calibrators and distant galaxies .",
    "omitting the early - type galaxies with @xmath130 leaves a sample of 29 sneia with @xmath131 .",
    "their hubble diagram gives an intercept of @xmath132 , from which follows @xmath133 .",
    "the statistical error is here somewhat larger , because the snia luminosity does not correlate as tightly with @xmath129 as with @xmath19 , but the essential point is that even without the @xmath19 corrections @xmath0 does not change significantly .",
    "the very small statistical error of @xmath0(cosmic ) in equation  ( [ eq:04 ] ) is treacherous in view of possible systematic errors . in principle",
    "it is not possible to give a reliable estimate of systematic errors because they are due to the unknown .",
    "but one can list points where one depends on assumptions and where random errors of correction factors perpetuate as systematic errors .    the value of @xmath0 and its systematic error depends on two parameters , i.e.  the intercept @xmath134 of the hubble diagram of sneia and the absolute magnitude @xmath56 of the calibrating sneia .",
    "the systematic errors of these two parameters will be discussed in turn .",
    "the intercept @xmath134 depends on the recession velocities @xmath135 and on the apparent maximum magnitudes @xmath136 of sneia with @xmath137 .",
    "systematic errors of the observed velocities and of their correction to the cmb frame are negligible . equally the observed apparent magnitudes do not introduce a systematic error . the magnitudes are corrected for galactic and internal absorption .",
    "the internal absorption is based on the intrinsic colors @xmath26 and @xmath27 of sneia at @xmath1 maximum and 35 days thereafter and on reddening - absorption ratios @xmath138 specificly derived for sneia ( @xcite ) . these absorption corrections  which remove any dependence of @xmath134 on galaxy type or on the size of the absorption ( @xcite , table  8 , solutions 6 - 8 ) ",
    "do not introduce a systematic error as long as they are consistently applied to the hubble diagram sneia and to the nearby calibrating sneia .",
    "the same holds for the normalization of the magnitudes to a decline rate of @xmath81 and a color of @xmath139 ( @xcite , equation  23 ) .",
    "therefore the value of the intercept @xmath134 as such does not introduce a systematic error .",
    "the absolute magnitudes @xmath56 of the calibrating sneia may carry systematic errors for two reasons : ( 1 ) errors of their apparent magnitudes due to inconsistencies of their absorption correction and of their normalization to @xmath81 and @xmath140 , and ( 2 ) metallicity - related distance errors and a zero - point error of the adopted distance scale .",
    "while the apparent maximum magnitudes of the distant sneia are based on ccd photometry , four of the oldest calibrators have photographic photometry , but the magnitudes were transformed into the standard @xmath141 system for sn1937c [ @xcite ; following this source we have discarded the fainter photometry of @xcite . if it were included here the mean luminosity of the 10 calibrators would decrease by only @xmath142 , 1960f @xcite , 1974 g @xcite , and 1981b @xcite .",

    "they rest on two hypotheses : ( 1 ) the observed difference of the @xmath23-@xmath24 relations in the galaxy and lmc is caused by the metal difference of the two galaxies , and ( 2 ) the slopes of the @xmath23-@xmath24 relations transform smoothly from lmc to the galaxy as [ o / h ] ( or @xmath31 ) increases .",
    "both points are consistent with earlier models cited in   [ sec : intro ] , but it remained the concern that the increase of @xmath32 accompanying any increase of @xmath31 would counterbalance the shift",

    "the decline rate correction , first quantified by @xcite , increases ( in its present form ) @xmath0 by 3 units , and the passage from a @xmath187 universe to @xmath112 , @xmath113 brought an additional increase of 0.8 units .",
    "the latest increase of @xmath0 by 6.5% over our value in @xcite is due to an accumulation of small effects .",
    "it should first be noted that the values @xmath56 and @xmath134 here are reduced to @xmath81 and @xmath139 , while the reference values were @xmath188 and @xmath189 in 2001 .",
    "this affects _ equally _ the apparent magnitudes @xmath190 of the calibrators and the intercepts @xmath134 of the distant sneia , and has no effect on @xmath0 .",

    "also the coefficients @xmath195 of the @xmath19 correction had to be increased for reasons explained in @xcite ; this dims the calibrators with their higher @xmath196 ( see table  [ tab:05 ] ) more than the distant sneia by @xmath52 on average ( 1% ) .",
    "a further increase comes from the new photometry of sn1998aq ( 1% ) and the arrival of the slightly faint tenth calibrator , sn1998ae , ( 0.6% ) .",
    "finally the adopted cepheid distances @xmath197 of the calibrating host galaxies , as derived in @xcite from new @xmath23-@xmath24 relations and new metallicity corrections and used in table  [ tab:01 ] , are 1% smaller than those in @xcite , the latter containing a bulk metallicity correction of @xmath182 and resting on a slightly brighter zero - point of @xmath198 .",
    "these effects together increase our 2001-value of @xmath199 to @xmath200 , which is statistically the same as the present value of @xmath201 .",

    "the route through equation  ( [ eq:05 ] ) is here actually preferable because the errors of the small distances @xmath221 are small compared to the errors of @xmath224 , which may be contaminated by important peculiar velocities .",

    "<S> this is the fifth and final summary paper of our 15 year program using the hubble space telescope ( hst ) to determine the hubble constant using type ia supernovae , calibrated with cepheid variables in nearby galaxies that hosted them . </S>",
    "<S> several developments not contemplated at the start of the program in 1990 have made it necessary to put the summary on @xmath0 on a broader basis than originally thought , making four preparatory papers ( cited in the text ) necessary . </S>",
    "<S> the new cepheid distances of the subset of 10 galaxies , which were hosts of normal sneia , give weighted mean luminosities in @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 at maximum light of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these calibrate the adopted sneia hubble diagram from paper  iii to give @xmath7 ( random ) @xmath8 ( systematic ) in units of @xmath9mpc@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a global value because it uses the hubble diagram between redshift limits of @xmath11 and @xmath12 reduced to the cmb kinematic frame , well beyond the effects of any local random and streaming motions . </S>",
    "<S> local values of @xmath0 between 4.4 and 30@xmath13mpc from cepheids , sneia , 21cm - line widths , and the tip of the red - giant branch ( trgb ) all agree within 5% of our global value . </S>",
    "<S> this agreement of @xmath0 on all scales from @xmath14mpc finds its most obvious explanation in the smoothing effect of vacuum energy on the otherwise lumpy gravitational field due to the non - uniform distribution of the local galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the physical methods of time delay of gravitational lenses and the sunyaev - zeldovich effect are consistent ( but with large errors ) with our global value . </S>",
    "<S> the present result is also not in contradiction with existing analyses of cmb data , because they either lead to wide error margins of @xmath0 or depend on the choice of unwarrented priors that couple the value of @xmath0 with a number of otherwise free parameters in the cmb acoustic waves . </S>",
    "<S> our value of @xmath0 is 14% smaller than the value of @xmath0 found by @xcite because our independent cepheid distances to the six sneia - calibrating galaxies used in that analysis average @xmath15 larger than those used earlier . </S>"
