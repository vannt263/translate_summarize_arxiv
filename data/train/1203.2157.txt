    "the cause of the acceleration of the universe s expansion , real or apparent it may be , is yet shrouded in mystery .",
    "the easiest explanation involves einstein s cosmological constant and results in the  standard \" cosmological model , @xmath2cdm .",
    "however , this suffers of fine tuning problems , as well as all up to now available alternative models .",
    "since the observations of supernovae type ia ( snia ) @xcite , many other probes have confirmed this acceleration , and several experiments are planned in order to understand the nature of the phenomenon , usually called `` dark energy '' .",
    "the quality and quantity of the upcoming data will allow to better distinguish among different models , both from the background expansion and from the cosmological perturbations point of view .",
    "in this context , it is important to determine and understand as well as possible all signatures characterising different models .    in two previous papers @xcite ,",
    "some of us have studied the influence of dark energy perturbations on the evolution of cosmological perturbations and on the observables related to it . to quantify this impact ,",
    "the two parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 introduced in @xcite were evaluated , the first measuring the fraction of dark energy density perturbations and the second related to the sum of the gravitational potentials , observable with weak lensing . in both @xcite ,",
    "dark energy was modeled as a fluid characterised by an equation of state @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are pressure and energy density , respectively ) and a sound speed @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 are the pressure perturbations ) , both assumed to be constant .",
    "paper @xcite found a simple and useful analytical expression for matter and dark energy perturbations , while paper @xcite looked more carefully at observational implications .",
    "here we take a further step in generalising the dark energy fluid .",
    "we introduce an additional degree of freedom : the anisotropic stress . from the seminal work @xcite , we know that a classical scalar field has no anisotropic stress .",
    "although most dark energy models are based on scalar fields ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) , it is nevertheless interesting , also based of the fact that very little is known about dark energy , to study this very general fluid and see how such a term would affect density perturbations and observables which are sensitive to them .",
    "moreover , modified gravity models may be reformulated as _ effective dark energy fluids _ with anisotropic stress . the possibility of detecting it is therefore related to the problem of distinguishing dark energy from modified gravity .    probably due to the absence of anisotropic stress in classical scalar fields , which are among the most popular candidates for dark energy , there is not much literature on this subject",
    ". one interesting paper on this is @xcite . here",
    "a  generalised dark matter \" with an anisotropic stress component was studied .",
    "this anisotropy corresponds , in the case of the fluid , to a viscosity term @xmath10 damping density perturbations .",
    "the authors of this paper designed an equation governing the evolution of the anisotropic stress which recovers the free streaming equations of motion for radiation up to the quadrupole . in @xcite",
    "this same general parameterisation of the dark energy component was analysed with data from the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) , large scale structure and supernovae type ia , finding that both @xmath0 and @xmath10 were hard to constrain and that even future data would not improve very much in measuring them .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite . here",
    "forecasts were made on how well future cmb experiments will constrain an _ early , cold and stressed _ dark energy .",
    "also @xcite used this parameterisation to constrain extra neutrino species which are not explained by particles physics .",
    "a different approach on anisotropic stress was taken by @xcite , which found general consistency relations for @xmath2cdm and studied anisotropies arising even in @xmath2cdm from second order perturbations .",
    "a non exhaustive list of other works concerning observable consequences of an anisotropic stress term is @xcite .    in this context ,",
    "our approach is similar as in @xcite : we aim to try and solve _ analytically _ the perturbation equations for the simplest possible model of an anisotropic stress dark energy fluid in the simplest sensible approximations .",
    "this is useful both to understand more clearly the signatures induced by viscosity and to build simple tools for comparisons with observations .",

    ", the anisotropic horizon crossing happens at @xmath72 : the smaller is @xmath10 , the later in time perturbations enter the horizon and consequently they have more time to grow .",
    "the reader might think that the terms appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma - sub ] ) come to dominate eventually for a small value of @xmath10 , when @xmath15 is small",

    "( [ eq : delta0 ] ) . only when the anisotropic horizon has been crossed perturbations stop growing because @xmath1 becomes important .",

    "hence , being @xmath15 large , only the first constant term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma - sub - cs0 ] ) is important . to prove this ,",
    "let us consider the decaying mode in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma - sub - cs0 ] ) for @xmath67 , [ eq : decaying ] = ( 1+w)~ where @xmath65 . the above term is larger than the constant term if @xmath73 , but it can never dominate because the anisotropic horizon is at @xmath74 .",
    "what happens at large scales when @xmath10 is larger , say @xmath75 ? from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma - sub - cs0 ] ) it would seem again that @xmath1 can not be approximated by a constant . here",
    "a different mechanism comes into play : large scales enter the causal horizon later than small scales ( e.g. during matter domination at @xmath76 ) , hence perturbations with small @xmath43 cross the causal horizon at sufficiently large @xmath15 so that the time - dependent terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma - sub - cs0 ] ) can be neglected .",
    "if e.g. we take scales as large as @xmath77 , the causal horizon is at @xmath78 and here we get ( again for @xmath79 ) = ~0.2",
    "this quantity becomes even smaller for values of @xmath11 closer to @xmath80 .",
    "the considerations made in this section ensure us that the time dependent terms ( [ eq : decaying ] ) decay fast enough in all relevant cases .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the anisotropic stress is not always the dominant component affecting the growth of dark energy perturbations . as an example , we plot in fig .",
    "( [ fig : deltas - cs001-cvs ] ) the evolution of the dark energy density contrast @xmath45 for different values of the viscosity term @xmath10 ( with the corresponding anisotropic horizon ) while keeping the sound speed @xmath0 fixed .",
    "as the viscosity term decreases , perturbations start to feel the presence of pressure perturbations , which , similarly to @xmath10 , damp @xmath45 once it crosses the sound horizon .",
    "at this point , having density perturbations already been damped , the anisotropic horizon plays no role anymore and the viscosity term becomes unimportant .",
    "this effect can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig : deltas - cs001-cvs ] ) , where the red solid line and the green long - dash - dotted line , corresponding to @xmath81 and @xmath67 , respectively , are basically unaltered when crossing their anisotropic horizon ( that for the value used it happens at @xmath82 ) , having already experienced the damping due to pressure perturbations .",
    "a similar behaviour can be seen when the anisotropic horizon is crossed before the sound horizon : here @xmath45 is damped by the viscosity of the fluid and the crossing of the sound horizon later in time produces no effect .",

    "we can ask when the anisotropic stress comes to dominate over pressure perturbations .",
    "the sound speed starts becoming more important than anisotropic stress if @xmath85 ( for our value of @xmath11 ) , which is also confirmed by numerical results .",
    "when dark energy starts dominating , @xmath18 starts decaying ; moreover , dark energy is also clustering .",
    "this variation can be conveniently represented using the parameterisation defined in @xcite where two new quantities were introduced : @xmath3 , which is directly related to the poisson equation and describes the amount of clustering dark energy , and @xmath86 , which is related to the amount of anisotropic stress . using this new parameterisation",

    "we also see that once the matter perturbations enter the anisotropic horizon , the analytical and numerical solution coincide and both tend to the solution of unclustered dark energy .",
    "this is consistent with what we have learned from the previous section , i.e. that dark energy perturbations inside the anisotropic ( or effective sound ) horizon are damped and can be neglected .",
    "an implication of this is that anisotropic stress will be difficult to detect being present only at large scales .",
    "also , for @xmath114 we expect a maximum @xmath115 enhancement of @xmath116 on scales larger than both the anisotropic and the sound horizon .",
    "our numerical calculation shows that the enhancement is closer to @xmath117 , hence the effect is very small .",
    "having evaluated the impact of the anisotropy on the matter power spectrum amplitude , we move to compute explicitly a more easily observable parameter .      in the @xmath2cdm scenario ,",
    "dark matter perturbations grow logarithmically with the scale factor @xmath15 during radiation domination and when matter domination starts they grow linearly ; at late times , when dark energy starts to dominate , the growth of dark matter perturbations is suppressed .",
    "it is known that in the @xmath2cdm model the growth factor can be defined as : g(a)=\\{_0^aa } where @xmath118 is called the growth index .",
    "there are two ways to modify the growth factor .",
    "first , one can use a different background cosmology , associated to a different hubble expansion .",
    "second , perturbations can differ : if dark energy starts to cluster , then the gravitational potentials change , being sourced by the total density perturbations and by the anisotropic stress ( see the poisson equation ( [ eq.poisson_general ] ) and the fourth einstein equation ( [ eq.4theinsteinb ] ) ) and this will affect the growth rate of dark matter .",
    "it is possible to include all these effects in the growth index @xmath119 and we therefore expect @xmath119 to be a function of @xmath11 , @xmath0 and @xmath10(or equivalently of @xmath11 , @xmath3 and @xmath86 ) .    in @xcite ,",
    "the dependence of the growth index from the dark energy clustering parameters @xmath3 and @xmath86 was described as = [ eq : gamma - qeta ] where a(q,)=. [ eq : a - qeta ] while dark energy perturbations themselves are difficult to measure unless dark energy has very low sound speed and viscosity , the growth index seems to be a more easily detectable parameter and several ongoing and future experiments are built to measure its value .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the presence of a sound speed ( when @xmath120 ) in the dark energy perturbations always decreases the value of the growth index @xmath119 because @xmath87 is always positive due to the relative increase of dark energy perturbations . here instead the addition of a non - zero anisotropic stress may lead to an _ enhancement _ of the growth index . to prove this",
    "let us consider a particular case . if we take modes above the sound horizon , using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : q - above ] ) and eq .",

    "if we assume @xmath114 then @xmath123 is negative as long as @xmath124 and @xmath119 is enhanced .",
    "however , the effect of the anisotropic stress on scales of interest is very small due the smallness of the factor @xmath125 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a - qeta ] ) that contains the term @xmath126 .",
    "again , if the anisotropic stress is zero , then dark energy perturbations always decrease the value of the growth index ; we find that the strongest deviation from @xmath127 happens when @xmath128 and @xmath129 and it is of the order of @xmath130% , see @xcite .",
    "if we want to increase the growth index and at the same time we also want perturbations in the dark energy sector then we need a non zero anisotropic contribution ; this is the case for the dgp model ( treated as an effective anisotropic dark energy , see @xcite ) where the growth index is @xmath131 . however , the type of anisotropic stress used in this paper is unable to increase the growth rate @xmath119 from @xmath132 to such a large value .",
    "for instance , if we assume the viscosity term to be @xmath133 then @xmath134 for scales @xmath135 .",

    "[ sec : matterpk ] , having ascertained that it is very small .",
    "this means that the two curves corresponding to different @xmath10 differ because of the term @xmath152 .",

    "[ fig : isw - cls ] .",
    "we have checked this by fixing @xmath156 and letting @xmath157 and noticing that the results are unchanged .",
    "this means that the effect of @xmath10 on the isw comes mainly from the term @xmath158 . using eq .",

    "let us now go back to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) and look at the final total effect . we know that as dark energy slows down the growth of dark matter perturbations , at late times @xmath162 is always negative",
    "@xmath140 instead can be positive or negative depending on the value of @xmath10 , although in both cases it is a small number .",
    "therefore we have two possibilities : the first is when the two contributions partially cancel and so make the effect smaller ( this is in general the case for small values of the viscosity term ) ; the second is when the two contributions sum up enhancing the total effect .    to visualise this we proceed as in @xcite by defining a magnification parameter for the isw power spectrum [ eq : magnification ] ^2 & = & \\{}^2 + & = & ( +  g / g)^2 , which we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : magnification ] for two values of @xmath10 for @xmath163 . here",
    "we keep the sound speed and the viscosity term small enough so that the dark energy perturbations have time to grow before entering the effective sound horizons . for small @xmath10 the dark energy perturbations are able to grow for sufficiently long time and they partially cancel the contribution from @xmath162 and decrease @xmath164 by about 40% .",
    "as we increase the viscosity term @xmath10 the effects become smaller because the dark energy perturbations cross the effective sound horizon early , increasing @xmath164 .",
    "based on these considerations , we expect again the viscosity term to act similarly as the sound speed : a low value of @xmath10 decreases the power of the isw effect , differentiating it from the standard case .    as mentioned",
    "before , there might be cases where @xmath165 is negative , enhancing the total isw effect . in fig .",
    "( [ fig : magnification - cv1 ] ) we show the magnification @xmath164 for @xmath133 and @xmath166 , setting @xmath167 in both cases .",
    "if the sound speed is large enough then @xmath140 is negative and it sums up to @xmath162 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma ] ) .",
    "nevertheless the effect is too small ( of the order of @xmath168 ) and it is practically unobservable in the  @xmath169s .",
    "in this paper we have studied an imperfect fluid dark energy with non - vanishing viscous anisotropic stress .",
    "the model we have considered is described by its background constant equation of state @xmath170 and at linear order in perturbations by its sound speed @xmath171 and its viscosity parameter @xmath172 . for the dark energy density and velocity perturbations we have found simple analytical expressions represented in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : delta - sub - below ] ) to ( [ eq : delta - abovesh ] ) .",
    "although we have assumed matter domination throughout this work , the functions @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 which can be computed with our simplified analytical expressions are approximating well numerical results even at later times , when dark energy starts dominating .",
    "our analytical expressions can be seen as the `` fingerprints '' of a viscous dark energy model ( or of a modified gravity model that can be effectively described by such an anisotropic stress ) .",
    "in particular we find that the dark energy perturbations are always smaller than the perturbations in dark matter , by a factor @xmath53 if the viscosity term is small , @xmath176 and by an even larger factor of @xmath52 when the anisotropic stress is not negligible .",
    "if dark energy has zero anisotropic stress then it is possible to divide the evolution of its perturbations in three phases : outside the causal horizon , inside the causal horizon but outside the sound horizon and inside the sound horizon . in the latter regime",
    "their growth is suppressed . in the presence of a non zero viscosity term",
    ", a further horizon comes into the play , which we dubbed _",
    "anisotropic horizon_. once perturbations enter this horizon , they are damped as in the case of the sound horizon .",
    "this adds in principle two extra regimes : perturbations larger than the anisotropic horizon and perturbations smaller than the anisotropic horizon .",
    "the last two regimes may happen before or after the sound horizon depending if @xmath10 is larger or smaller than the sound speed . in practice",
    "though , since both the sound speed and the viscosity damp the dark energy perturbations in a similar way , we can speak of only one _ effective sound horizon _",
    ", which , once crossed , suppresses the growth of dark energy perturbations ; this makes @xmath0 and @xmath10 degenerate when considering dark energy density perturbations .",
    "we then have used the equations for @xmath3 and @xmath4 to study analytically the effect of dark energy perturbations on the dark matter power spectrum , on the growth factor and on the isw effect .",
    "the changes in the matter power spectrum and in the growth index at late times are of the order of a few percent on scales larger than the effective sound horizon of the dark energy .",
    "we also have found that the isw effect is modified mainly by the time variation of the parameter @xmath140 while modifications in @xmath4 itself do not have appreciable consequences .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 is a combination of the dark energy density contrast ( through @xmath3 ) and the anisotropic stress ( through @xmath86 ) which both prevent perturbations from growing .",
    "because of this , the two effects are difficult to capture separately as they both act similarly . to disentangle the two effects",
    "is possible in principle by using joint observations which measure @xmath3 and @xmath4 , such as e.g. the galaxy power spectrum together with the weak lensing maps . in a follow - up paper @xcite",
