    ", industrial tomography explores the interior of an object and is often used for non - destructive testing .",
    "we are interested here in a very specific application of tomographic reconstruction for a physical experiment described later .",
    "the goal of this experiment is to study the behavior of a material under a shock .",
    "we obtain during the deformation of the object an x - ray radiography by high speed image capture .",
    "we suppose this object is radially symmetric , so that one radiograph is enough to reconstruct the 3d object .",
    "several authors have proposed techniques ( standard in medical tomography ) for tomographic reconstruction when enough projections ( from different points of view ) are available : this allows to get an analytic formula for the solution ( see for instance @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "these methods can not be used directly when only a few number of projections is known .",
    "some alternative methods have been proposed in order to partially reconstruct the densities ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "we are interesting here in single view tomographic reconstruction for radially symmetric object ( see for instance @xcite for a more complete presentation of the subject ) . as any tomographic reconstruction",
    ", this problem leads to an ill - posed inverse problem .",
    "as we only have one radiograph , data are not very redundant and the ill - posed character is even more accurate .",
    "we present here a tomographic method adapted to this specific problem , originally developed in @xcite , and based on a curve evolution approach .",
    "the main idea is to add some a priori knowledge on the object we are studying in order to improve the reconstruction .",
    "the object may then be described by a small set of characters ( in this case , they will be curves ) which are estimated by the minimization of an energy functional .",
    "this work is very close to another work by feng and al @xcite .",
    "the main difference is the purpose of the work : whereas they are seeking recovering textures , we are looking for accurate edges .",
    "it is also close to the results of bruandet and al @xcite .",
    "however , the present work handles very noisy data and highly unstable inverse problems , and shows how this method is powerful despite these perturbations .",
    "further , we take here into account the effects of blur ( which may be non - linear ) and try to deconvolve the image during the reconstruction .",
    "let us mention at this point that our framework if completely different from the usual tomographic point of view , and usual techniques ( such as filtered back - projection ) are not adapted to our case .",
    "indeed , usually , as the x - rays are supposed to be parallel ( this is also the case here ) , the `` horizontal '' slices of the object are supposed to be independent and studied separately .",
    "usual regularization techniques deal with one slice and regularize this particular slice . here , because of the radial symmetry , the slices are composed of concentric annulus and do not need any regularization .",
    "the goal of this work is to add some consistency between the slices in order to improve the reconstruction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we present the physical experiment whose data are extracted and explain what are the motivations of the work .",
    "next , we introduce the projection operator . in section 4 ,",
    "we present a continuous model with the suitable functional framework and prove existence result .",
    "section 5 is devoted to formal computation of the energy derivative in order to state some optimality conditions . in section 6 , a front propagation point of view",
    "is adopted and the level set method leads to a non local hamilton - jacobi equation . in the last section , we present some numerical results and give hints for numerical schemes improvement .",
    "this work is part of some physical experiments whose goal is the study of the behavior of shocked material .",
    "the present experiment consists in making a hull of well known material implode using surrounding explosives .",
    "the whole initial physical setup ( the hull , the explosives ... ) are radially symmetric .",
    "a reasonable assumption is to suppose that during the implosion , everything remains radially symmetric .",
    "physicists are looking for the shape of the interior at some fixed time of interest . at that time",
    ", the interior may be composed of several holes which also may be very irregular .",
    "figure [ fig : object ] is a synthetic object that contains all the standard difficulties that may appear .",
    "these difficulties are characterized by :    * several disconnected holes . * a small hole located on the symmetry axis ( which is the area where the details are difficult to recover ) .",
    "* smaller and smaller details on the boundary of the top hole in order to determine a lower bound detection .    to achieve this goal ,",
    "a x - rays radiograph is obtained . in order to extract the desired informations",
    ", a tomographic reconstruction must be performed .",
    "let us note here that , as the object is radially symmetric , a single radiography is enough to compute the reconstruction .",
    "a radiography measures the attenuation of x - rays through the object . a point on the radiography",
    "will be determined by its coordinates @xmath0 in a cartesian coordinates system where the @xmath1-axis will be the projection of the symmetry axis .",
    "if @xmath2 is the intensity of the incident x - rays flux , the measured flux @xmath3 at a point @xmath0 is given by @xmath4 where the integral operates along the ray that reaches the point @xmath0 of the detector , @xmath5 is the infinitesimal element of length along the ray and @xmath6 is the local attenuation coefficient . for simplicity",
    ", we will consider that this coefficient is proportional to the material density . to deal with linear operators ,",
    "we take the neperian logarithm of this attenuation and will call the transformation @xmath7 the projection operator .    through the rest of the paper , in order to simplify the expression of the projection operator , we will suppose that the x - ray source is far enough away from the object so that we may consider that the rays are parallel , and orthogonal to the symmetry axis . as a consequence , the horizontal slices of the object may be considered separately to perform the projection .",
    "as the studied object is radially symmetric , we will work in a system of cylinder coordinates @xmath8 where the @xmath9-axis is the symmetry axis .",
    "the object is then described by the density at the point @xmath8 , which is given by a function @xmath10 which depends only on @xmath11 by symmetry . in the text",
    ", the notation @xmath10 will always refer to the density of the object .",
    "a typical function @xmath10 is given in figure [ fig : whole - object ] .",
    "it represents an object composed of concentric shells of homogeneous materials ( called the `` exterior '' in what follows ) surrounding a ball ( called the `` interior '' ) of another homogeneous material that contains some empty holes .",
    "this figure may be viewed as a slice of the object by a plane that contains the symmetry axis . to recover the 3d - object",
    ", it suffices to perform a rotation of this image around the @xmath9 axis .",
    "for instance , the two round white holes in the center are in fact the slice of a torus . as the looked - after characteristic of the object is the shape of the holes",

    "the homogeneous material is in black whereas the holes are in white.,width=188 ]",
    "we first explicit the projection operator and its adjoint .    in the case of a radially symmetric object ,",
    "the projection operator , denoted by @xmath12 , is given , for every function @xmath13 with compact support , by @xmath14     _ proof -  _ consider a 3d - object which is described by a function @xmath15 ( cartesian coordinates system ) .",
    "the projection operator @xmath12 is @xmath16 in the case of radially symmetric object , we parametrize the object by a function @xmath17 with cylinder coordinates .",
    "therefore @xmath18 then , we have , for @xmath19 @xmath20 we perform the following change of variable @xmath21 to get @xmath22 for @xmath23 , we have @xmath24 using the change of variable @xmath25 and the fact that @xmath26 is even , by symmetry , we get @xmath27 @xmath28    operator @xmath12 may be defined by density on measurable functions @xmath10 such that all the partial applications @xmath29 belong to @xmath30 .",
    "then , all the functions @xmath31 belong to the space @xmath32 of bounded mean oscillations functions : @xmath33 where @xmath34 . for more details , one can refer to @xcite .    in the sequel , we will need to handle functions @xmath10 that are defined on @xmath35 ( instead of on @xmath36 ) .",
    "we thus define the operator @xmath12 for function @xmath37 with compact support by @xmath38 although this has no more physical meaning . here , the function @xmath39 is defined by @xmath40    we shall also need the back - projection that is the adjoint operator @xmath41 of @xmath12 ; it can be computed in a similar way .",
    "[ propadj]the adjoint operator ( in @xmath42 ) @xmath41 of the projection operator is given , for every function @xmath43 with compact support by : @xmath44     _ proof -  _ the adjoint operator @xmath41 of @xmath12 is the unique operator such that , for every @xmath10 and @xmath45 in @xmath46 with compact support , @xmath47 using ( [ h ] ) and fubini s theorem , we get @xmath48 so we obtain the following expression for the back projection : @xmath49 @xmath28      thanks to the symmetry , this operator characterizes the radon transform of the object and so is invertible ; one radiograph is enough to reconstruct the object .",
    "the inverse operator is given , for an almost everywhere differentiable function @xmath45 with compact support , and for every @xmath50 , by @xmath51    because of the derivative term , the operator @xmath52 is not continuous . consequently , a small variation on the measure @xmath45 leads to significant errors on the reconstruction .",
    "as our radiographs are strongly perturbed , applying @xmath52 to our data leads to a poor reconstruction . due to the experimental setup",
    "they are also two main perturbations :    * a blur , due to the detector response and the x - ray source spot size . * a noise .",
    "others perturbations such as scattered field , motion blur ... also exist but are neglected in this study .",
    "+ we denote by @xmath53 the effect of blurs .",
    "we will consider the following simplified case where @xmath53 is supposed to be linear @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the usual convolution operation , @xmath56 is the projected image and @xmath57 is a positive symmetric kernel .",
    "a more realistic case stands when the convolution operates on the intensity : then @xmath53 is of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the multiplicative coefficient between the density and the attenuation coefficient .",
    "some specific experiments have been carried out to measure the blur effect .",
    "consequently , we will suppose that , in both cases , the kernel @xmath57 is known .",
    "the linear blur is not realistic but is treated here to make the computations simpler for the presentation .",
    "the noise is supposed for simplicity to be an additive gaussian white noise of mean 0 , denoted by @xmath60 .",
    "consequently , the projection of the object @xmath10 will be @xmath61 the comparison between the theoretical projection @xmath62 and the perturbed one is shown on figure [ fig : real_proj ] . the reconstruction using the inverse operator @xmath52 applied to @xmath45",
    "is given by figure [ fig : inverse ] .",
    "the purpose of the experiment is to separate the material from the empty holes and consequently to precisely determine the frontier between the two areas , which is difficult to perform on the reconstruction of figure [ fig : inverse ] .     of the object of figure  [ fig : object ] .",

    ", we must add some a priori knowledge on the object to be reconstructed .",
    "indeed the object that we reconstruct must satisfy some physical property .",
    "we chose to stress on two points :    * the center of the object is composed of one homogeneous known material s density with some holes inside .",
    "* there can not be any material inside a hole .    in a previous work @xcite , j.m .",
    "lagrange reconstructed the exterior of the object .",
    "in this reconstruction , the density of the material at the center of the object is known , only the holes are not reconstructed .",
    "in other words , we can reconstruct an object without holes and we can compute ( as @xmath12 and @xmath53 are known ) the theoretical projection of this reconstruction .",
    "we then act as if the blurred projection was linear and subtract the projection of the non - holed object to the data . in",
    "what follows , we will call experimental data this subtracted image which corresponds to the blurred projection of a `` fictive '' object of density 0 with some holes of known `` density '' @xmath63 .",
    "consequently , the space of admitted objects will be the set of functions @xmath10 that take values in @xmath64 .",
    "this space of functions will be denoted @xmath65 in the sequel .",
    "the second hypothesis is more difficult to take into account .",
    "we chose in this work to tackle the problem via an energy minimization method where the energy functional is composed of two terms : the first one is a matching term , the second one is a penalization term which tries to handle the second assumption . the matching term will be a @xmath42-norm which is justified by the gaussian white noise .    in the case where @xmath53 is not linear , the exact method to remove",
    "the exterior is to operate the blur function on the addition of the known exterior and the center . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will not use this method and will consider that the errors are negligible when subtracting the projections .",

    "this time , the functions @xmath66 will be defined on @xmath35 , with values still in @xmath67 , with compact support .",
    "therefore , such a function @xmath10 will be characterized by the knowledge of the curves that limit the two areas where @xmath10 is equal to @xmath68 and to @xmath69 . indeed , as the support of the function @xmath10 is bounded , these curves are disjoint jordan curves and the density of the inside is @xmath68 whereas the density of the outside is 0 .",
    "consequently , the energy that we will consider will be a function of @xmath70 where @xmath70 is a set of disjoint jordan curves . for mathematical reasons",
    ", we must add an extra - assumption : the curves @xmath70 are @xmath71 so that the normal vector of the curves is well - defined ( as an orthogonal vector to the tangent one ) .    in this continuous framework ,",
    "the matching term is just the usual @xmath42-norm between @xmath72 and the data @xmath45 ( where @xmath12 is given by ( [ h ] ) ) .",

    "we used an explicit scheme in time and the spatial discretization has been performed following @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath218 so that the equation ( [ eq : levelset ] ) is @xmath219 we set @xmath220 with @xmath221 et @xmath222 .",
    "the explicit euler scheme gives : @xmath223 the curvature term is computed as @xmath224 where @xmath225 stands for the partial derivative with respect to @xmath211 .",
    "the discrete approximation of the gradient is standard : @xmath226 @xmath227 are @xmath228 defined in the same way .",
    "a usual approximation for   @xmath229 is given by : @xmath230^{1/2}~.\\ ] ] the non local term @xmath231 is exactly computed .",
    "the previous scheme has been implemented on a 3.6 ghz pc .",
    "a classical reinitialization process has been used each 500 iterations .",
    "the test image size was 256 @xmath232 256 pixels .",
    "the other parameters of the computation were set to @xmath233 and the blur kernel is a gaussian kernel of standard deviation 5 pixels .",
    "the computed image is quite satisfying ( see figure 7 . )",
    "however , we note a bad reconstruction along the symmetry axis due to the problem geometry and a lack of information",
    ". moreover we have to improve the algorithme behavior .",
    "indeed , we observe numerical instability ( in spite of the regularization process ) that leads to a very small time step choice .",
    "therefore the computational time is quite long ( about 2.5 hours ) .",
    "in addition , classical stopping criteria are not useful here  : the expected solution corresponds to a `` flat '' level of function @xmath234 and the difference between two consecutive iterates means no sense .",
    "an estimate of the cost function decrease is not appropriate as well ( we observe oscillations ) .",
    "we decided to stop after a large enough number of iterations ( here 20 000 ) .    in spite of all these disadvantages ,",
    "this method is satisfactory considering the low signal to noise ratio of the radiograph .",
    "these good results can be explained by the strong assumptions that we add ( in particular the binary hypothesis ) which are verified by our synthetic object .",
    "anyway , the method has beeen successfully tested on `` real '' images as well , that is imgaes of objets with the same kind of properties ( `` almost '' binary ) but we can not report them here ( confidential data ) . a semi - implicit version of the algorithm is actually tested to improve stability ."

    "<S> this paper deals with a method of tomographic reconstruction of radially symmetric objects from a single radiograph , in order to study the behavior of shocked material . the usual tomographic reconstruction algorithms such as generalized inverse or filtered back - projection can not be applied here because data are very noisy and the inverse problem associated to single view tomographic reconstruction is highly unstable . in order to improve the reconstruction , we propose here to add some a priori assumptions on the looked after object . </S>",
    "<S> one of these assumptions is that the object is binary and consequently , the object may be described by the curves that separate the two materials . </S>",
    "<S> we present a model that lives in bv space and leads to a non local hamilton - jacobi equation , via a level set strategy . </S>",
    "<S> numerical experiments are performed ( using level sets methods ) on synthetic objects . </S>"
