    "<S> the charge reduction effect , produced by the nonlinear debye screening of high - z charges occuring in strongly - coupled plasmas , is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> an analytic asymptotic expression is obtained for the charge reduction factor ( @xmath0 ) which determines the debye - hckel potential generated by a charged test particle . </S>",
    "<S> its relevant parametric dependencies are analyzed and shown to predict a strong charge reduction effect in strongly - coupled plasmas .    </S>",
    "<S> a basic aspect of plasma physics is the so - called debye shielding of the electrostatic potential .  </S>",
    "<S> this consists in the property of plasmas ( or electrolytes @xcite ) , either quasi - neutral or non - neutral , to shield the electrostatic field produced by charged particles ( to be also denoted as test particles ) immersed in the same system . </S>",
    "<S> this result has fundamental consequences on plasma phenomenology , since it actually limits the range of static coulomb interactions inside the debye sphere , i.e. , at a distance @xmath1 from the test particle@xmath2 @xmath3 being the debye length . as usual here @xmath4 where the sum is carried out on all plasma species and @xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath7 being respectively the @xmath8species temperature and number density ( the latter defined in the absence of test particles ) . in fact , when both the particles and the plasma are assumed non - relativistic , small - amplitude , stationary ( or slowly time- and space - varying ) , electrostatic perturbations generated by isolated test particles , result effectively shielded in the external domain , i.e. , at distances larger than the debye length @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the renewed interest in this problem is particularly related to dusty plasmas or colloidal suspensions @xcite which are characterized by the presence of a large fraction of highly charged particles ( grains ) , i.e. , having an electric charge @xmath9 with @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> it is well established that the phenomenon of debye shielding of the electrostatic potential generated by a slowly moving or stationary charged test particle , when occurring in strongly coupled ionized gases , manifests peculiar properties . </S>",
    "<S> these are produced , as a consequence of the nonlinear plasma response occurring at distances smaller than the debye length @xmath3 , when the electrostatic potential ( @xmath11 ) results locally such that @xmath12 ( or even @xmath13)@xmath2 @xmath14 being the normalized electrostatic potential evaluated at a suitable characteristic distance @xmath15 from the position of the test particle @xmath16 and @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the distance @xmath15 can be identified with the radius of the local plasma sheath around a test particle . for spherically - symmetric test particles such </S>",
    "<S> a domain can be identified with the spherical subset of the configuration space , of radius @xmath18 ( average interparticle distance ) , @xmath19 being the density of the ion species , in which each test particle can be considered as isolated . </S>",
    "<S> ionized gases ( or electrolytes ) can be classified according to the characteristic dimensionless parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is denoted as the dimensionless electric charge of the test particle ) , @xmath23 and @xmath24 being respectively so - called _ plasma _ and _ coulomb coupling parameters_. in particular , for plasmas the high - density requirement @xmath25 is satisfied by assumption and can be interpreted as the condition that the total number of mutually interacting particles in a debye sphere ( expressed by @xmath26 ) results @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the ordering of parameter @xmath24 remains in principle arbitrary . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the orderings @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 ) correspond respectively to so - called weakly and strongly - coupled plasmas .  </S>",
    "<S> dusty and colloidal plasmas may be characterized  by @xmath30up to @xmath31 with typical grain size smaller than @xmath32 @xmath33 and with plasma temperature and the ion density @xmath34 ev , @xmath35 @xmath36 . in this case the  coulomb parameter for a negatively - charged grain in the presence of the plasma sheath produced by hydrogen ions can result as large as @xmath37 while the dimensionless radius of the ion plasma sheath can be estimated @xmath38 therefore , dusty plasmas typically result strongly coupled if @xmath39 . for these plasmas </S>",
    "<S> it is important to be able to evaluate the electrostatic potential generated by dust grains which is expected to be strongly influenced by debye shielding . </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that , in general , this phenomenon occurs provided suitable physical assumptions are introduced . in particular , the plasma must be assumed appropriately close to kinetic maxwellian equilibrium , in which each particle species is described by a maxwellian kinetic distribution function carrying finite fluid fields [ defined respectively by the number density , temperature and flow velocity @xmath40 . in the absence of test particles these fluid fields </S>",
    "<S> must be assumed slowly varying in a suitable sense , or constant , both with respect to position ( @xmath41 ) and time ( @xmath42 ) .  in this regard </S>",
    "<S> it is important to remark that the appropriate treatment of the plasma sheath surrounding each test particle is essential also for the validity of the mathematical model for the debye screening problem , i.e. , for the existence of classical solutions of the debye screening problem , which do not exist when letting @xmath43 tessarotto2005 . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> the electrostatic potential depends necessarily on the dimensionless parameter @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in the domain @xmath45 the dimensionless potential @xmath46 generated by a dust grain of charge @xmath47 fulfilling the boundary conditions @xmath48 and lim@xmath49 can be proven to satisfy the _ </S>",
    "<S> _ integral debye - poisson equation__@xmath50 s(x^{\\prime } , x_{o } ) ,   \\label{eq.0}\\]]yielding for @xmath51 the constraint equation@xmath52here @xmath53 while in the case of a negatively - charged test particles in a quasi - neutral three species ( electron , ion and dust ) plasma the source term @xmath54 reads @xmath55 , $ ]   @xmath56 being the heaviside function . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath57 is defined by the ratio @xmath58 in the case in which the contribution due to the dusty species is negligible , and moreover @xmath59 @xmath60 the previous expression reduces to the customary value @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> another useful representation of eq.([eq.0 ] ) can also be obtained by means of the transformation @xmath62and there results , by consistency with the integral dp equation ( [ eq.0 ] ) , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , with @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> this delivers for @xmath66 the integral equation@xmath67where @xmath68 is the solution of the integral equation @xmath69with @xmath70 to be expressed in terms of @xmath71 by means of eq.([eq.0c ] ) . on the other hand , for finite @xmath72 the debye - hckel asymptotic approximation for the electrostatic potential </S>",
    "<S> can be proven to hold when measuring the potential at a position @xmath41 sufficiently far from the position of the test particle @xmath73 in fact this involves imposing that the so - called _ weak - field condition _ @xmath74 be locally satisfied .  as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , the normalized electrostatic potential generated by a spherically - symmetric point particle of charge @xmath75 can be approximated by@xmath76where @xmath77 @xmath78 is a suitable dimensionless effective electric charge and @xmath79 is usually known as dh potential . </S>",
    "<S> the latter identifies the _ external asymptotic solution _ which holds in the subset of the external domain , outside the debye sphere , in which the weak - field condition is satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining notation is standard , thus @xmath80 is the distance from the point charge and @xmath81 @xmath82 $ ] is the corresponding normalized distance . </S>",
    "<S> the weak - field condition is manifestly locally satisfied both for strongly and weakly coupled plasmas , provided there results @xmath83 with @xmath84 suitably large ( i.e. , @xmath85 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the case in which there results either @xmath86 and/or @xmath87 i.e. , for strongly - coupled plasmas , the electrostatic potential may actually decay on a scale much shorter than the debye length and precisely on a scale suitably close to the boundary of the plasma sheath , i.e. , for @xmath88 this conclusion is consistent both with previous analytic estimates based on the exact solution of the 1d debye screening problem @xcite and direct numerical simulations of the 3d debye screening problem @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it implies , however , that the dh approximation typically holds also at distances suitably larger than the boundary of the plasma sheath @xmath44 and which extend also to values comparable to the debye length , i.e. , for @xmath89 @xcite . finally , as a further consequence , the effective electric charge carried by the dh potential @xmath90 may appear significantly reduced with respect to the case of weakly coupled plasmas @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to display this effect , it is convenient to represent the normalized effective charge of the test particle in the form @xmath91 , @xmath0 being the _ charge reduction factor . _ by dimensional analysis , it follows that @xmath0 must be of the form @xmath92 i.e. , @xmath0 is function , to be determined , of the only dimensionless parameters of the problem , namely @xmath44 and @xmath24 ( or @xmath93 ) and moreover the ratios @xmath94 ( with @xmath95)@xmath96  it is well - known that for weakly - coupled plasmas @xmath90 can be approximated by the normalized electric charge of the isolated test particle , i.e. , @xmath97 which implies @xmath98 instead , for strongly - coupled plasmas ,  the value of charge reduction factor , determined either via one - dimensional analytic estimates @xcite or by means of a variety of numerical simulation methods ( see , for example , robbins-1988,dupont1996,allayrov 1998,bystrenko 1999 ) , has been found to be notably smaller than unity , thus suggesting the existence of a possible significant _ charge reduction effect_.  indeed the investigation of the effective interactions characterizing high - z grains in plasmas has attracted interest in recent years especially for their role in dusty plasmas @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , for strongly - coupled plasmas the precise form of the function @xmath0 is still unknown and , in particular , an analytic estimate of the effective charge characterizing the dh potential in strongly - coupled plasmas is not yet available .    besides being of obvious interest as a still unsolved mathematical problem </S>",
    "<S> , it is especially important from the physical standpoint to estimate @xmath0 as a function of the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath24 for strongly coupled plasmas  characterized either by a high density and/or by the presence of a large fraction of highly charged particles ( grains ) , such as dusty plasmas and colloidal suspensions @xcite .    in a previous work @xcite , </S>",

    "<S> the accuracy of the asymptotic approximation @xmath125 and of the upper bound @xmath110 can be tested by comparing them with the estimate of the charge reduction factor obtained from direct numerical simulations of the 3d debye screening problem . for this purpose </S>",

    "<S> the estimate of the charge reduction factor @xmath142 here obtained , is a necessary prerequisite for the description of a variety of kinetic processes ( for example , condensation @xcite , collisional processes @xcite , etc . ) , as well as electrostatic or electromagnetic instabilities in dusty plasmas ( see for example @xcite ) . </S>"
