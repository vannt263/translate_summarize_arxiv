    "numerous studies of angular dependent local moment metamagnetism show that simple geometric relationships exist between the critical fields of the metamagnetic phase transitions , and the angle that the applied field makes with the corresponding easy axis .",
    "one simple case is that of tbni@xmath13ge@xmath13@xcite , a tetragonal compound with tb ions in tetragonal point symmetry , where , at low temperatures , the crystalline electric field ( cef ) anisotropy confines the local moments along the c ( [ 001 ] ) crystallographic axis ( ising - like system ) .",
    "consequently , several metamagnetic transitions are observed , with the critical field values @xmath14 having a @xmath15 dependence on the angle between the applied field _",
    "h _ and the c - axis .",
    "a more complex situation is encountered when the magnetic moments are allowed more degrees of freedom , _",
    "i.e. _ when the cef anisotropy constrains them to an easy plane .",
    "this is the case in the tetragonal compounds rni@xmath1b@xmath1c@xcite , with r = tb - er , and ragsb@xmath13@xcite for r = dy .",
    "the r ions are again in tetragonal point symmetry and the local moments are confined to four equivalent [ 110 ] or [ 100 ] crystallographic directions ; thus the angular dependent magnetization measurements , when the field is applied in the basal plane , reveal the four - fold anisotropy of the longitudinal magnetization that reflects the symmetry of the unit cell .",
    "the angular dependencies of the locally saturated magnetizations @xmath11 and the critical fields @xmath14 could be treated by simple analysis , and plausible net distribution of moments could be inferred for each metamagnetic phase@xcite .",
    "kalatsky and pokrovsky@xcite elaborated the four - position clock model , which agrees well with the observed metamagnetism in honi@xmath1b@xmath1c and dyagsb@xmath13 .",
    "initially thought to be improbable , angular dependent metamagnetism in extremely planar systems is now an accepted and understandable event in tetragonal compounds ; but this has not yet been well studied in hexagonal compounds , and this is the motivation for the present analysis .",
    "recently we reported the presence of metamagnetism in a hexagonal class of materials , _",
    "i.e. _ the ragge compounds , for r = tb - tm@xcite .",
    "they crystallize in the zrnial - type structure , an ordered variant of the hexagonal fe@xmath13p family . in this structure",
    ", there is a unique rare earth site in the unit cell , with the rare earth ions occupying equivalent 3 g positions with orthorhombic point symmetry ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the anisotropic susceptibility was found to be axial for tbagge and progressed towards extremely planar for tmagge .",
    "the physical properties of the tmagge compound ( antiferromagnetic ordering in the ground state , extremely planar anisotropy , metamagnetism when the applied field was perpendicular to the c - axis ) are very similar to those of the isostructural tbptin system , previously only known in polycrystalline form@xcite , making both compounds good candidates for a study of the angular dependent metamagnetism in hexagonal systems . in both tmagge and tbptin the r ions occupy the same site , whereas both ligands are different .",
    "having two such systems will allow us to show that the behavior we find is not specific to one compound , but a more general result associated with this structure , or perhaps with the orthorhombic point symmetry in a hexagonal unit cell . as we shall see",
    ", the nel temperature is much higher for tbptin ( 46.0 k ) than for tmagge ( 4.2 k ) , with the former also showing a possible spin reorientation transition at a fairly high temperature ( @xmath16 k ) .",
    "this latter transition in tbptin was missed by the measurements on polycrystalline samples@xcite , where even the nature of the magnetically ordered state below @xmath17 k was not identified .",
    "thus we can once again emphasize the advantage of analysis on single crystals rather than on polycrystalline samples .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : after a brief description of the experimental methods , we present the _ m(t , h ) _ data on tbptin , emphasizing the complexity of its ordered state , for field orientations along the two in - plane , high symmetry directions ; this is followed by the m(h,@xmath0 ) measurements at low temperature , from which the values of the locally saturated magnetizations and critical fields as a function of @xmath0 were extracted .",
    "next , we will introduce a model for the net distribution of moments , which we subsequently use to calculate the expected , locally saturated magnetizations @xmath18 and the critical fields ( for the transition from state i to state j ) @xmath19 as functions of @xmath0 .",
    "this will be followed by a comparison of how the calculated and experimental @xmath18 and @xmath19 values vary with the angle between the applied field h and the easy axis for this compound .",
    "similar measurements performed on tmagge will then be shown , leading to the corresponding experimental @xmath18(@xmath0 ) and @xmath19(@xmath0 ) phase diagrams , which we will again map onto the appropriate model calculation .",
    "we will also analyze similar @xmath20 data of tbptin for @xmath5 k , and use the same model in order to characterize a magnetic phase present only at higher temperatures .",
    "finally , we will summarize our key results and also indicate how our model can be generalized to a variety of possible point symmetries in tetragonal and hexagonal systems .",
    "using an initial concentration of tb@xmath21pt@xmath21in@xmath22 , clean hexagonal rods of tbptin were grown ; this in - rich self - flux was used because of its low - melting temperature and because it introduces no new elements into the melt .",
    "the constituent elements were placed in alumina crucibles and sealed in quartz tubes under partial argon pressure ; subsequently they were heated up to @xmath23 c , and then cooled down to @xmath24 c over 48 h. removal of the excess liquid solution revealed hexagonal rods with the c - axis along the axis of the rod .",
    "the crystal structure was confirmed by room temperature powder x - ray diffraction measurements , using cu k@xmath25 radiation , from which the lattice parameters a @xmath26 and c @xmath27 were also obtained .",
    "it is worth noting that the above temperature profile yielded in most cases well - formed , fairly good crystals ( residual resistivity ratio rrr @xmath28 ) ; however , some of the crystals had hollow channels in the center , sometimes with flux inclosures , and the quality of the resulting hexagonal rods seems to only deteriorate with slower cooling rates ( _ i.e. _ @xmath29 c / 100h ) .",

    "additional measurements up to 140 kg were also taken , using an extraction magnetometer in a quantum design physical properties measurement system ( ppms ) . in order to avoid torque on the rotator due to the extreme anisotropy of the samples ,  small mass samples  (  _ i.e. _",

    "@xmath0 ) measurements on the smaller samples were than calibrated using the data for the larger mass pieces ; this is believed to be very accurate given that the angular uncertainty in the rotator is less than @xmath35 .",
    "there is additional uncertainty introduced by possible misalignment of the small piece with the c - axis exactly perpendicular to the applied field ( due to the construction of the sample holder , this misalignment should nt be more than @xmath36 ) .",
    "laue experiments have been performed on well - formed single crystals .",
    "they confirmed that the as - grown facettes of the hexagonal rods are alternatingly parallel to the ( 101 ) and ( 011 ) crystallographic planes ( the macroscopic facettes are aligned with the hexagonal unit cell axes [ 100 ] or [ 010 ] ) .",

    "the above temperatures are further confirmed by the @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) data , also shown in fig.3b and c.    in the ordered state , as well as in the paramagnetic state up to @xmath46 k , the susceptibility is extremely anisotropic , with the local tb moments confined to the _ ab_-plane at low temperatures . to check the origin of the anisotropy in the paramagnetic state , single crystals of yptin were grown , with a small number of non - magnetic y@xmath47 ions substituted with magnetic tb@xmath47 ions .",

    "the field dependent magnetization measurements shown in fig.5a not only confirm the in - plane / out - of - plane anisotropy observed in the ordered state , but also indicate anisotropic magnetization within the basal plane .",
    "moreover , several metamagnetic transitions can be seen for the field parallel to the _ ab_-plane , for fields up to 140 kg in the @xmath59 data , and for the magnetoresistance measurements up to 90 kg in fig.5b .",
    "the geometry of the crystals led to more uncertainty in orienting the resistance pieces than the ones for magnetization measurements ; therefore we can infer the approximate orientation of the magnetoresistance sample with respect to the applied field , by comparing the @xmath60 data ( fig.5b ) with the @xmath59 curves for @xmath61 ( fig.5a ) : since various features in the magnetoresistance measurements occur closer to the critical fields in @xmath62)$ ] , we can assume that the field was almost parallel to the [ 120 ] direction .",

    "the concentration of the diluted sample is @xmath77 ; given this uncertainty , the absolute value of the magnetization @xmath78 in fig.6 could not be determined , and thus we scaled the data to the maximum value , @xmath79 .",

    "the field and temperature dependent magnetization measurements on tbptin ( fig.2 and 5 ) have shown that this compound is extremely anisotropic , with the magnetic moments confined to the hexagonal basal plane . moreover ,",
    "when the direction of the applied field is varied within the basal plane , six fold anisotropy of the saturated magnetization is revealed in both tbptin and its dilution ( tb@xmath170y@xmath171)ptin ( fig.6 ) .",
    "consequently , detailed magnetization measurements with @xmath172 were performed , allowing us to quantitatively describe the angular dependencies of the critical fields @xmath19 and locally saturated magnetizations @xmath173 ( fig.13 ) . by analogy to the four - position clock model @xcite for tetragonal systems , we are now proposing a simple model for the net distribution of moments in the hexagonal compound tbptin : three co - planar ising - like systems , @xmath8 apart in the basal plane .",
    "such a hypothesis was first suggested by the high field magnetization values observed in the pure compound tbptin , as well as in the highly diluted ( tb@xmath170y@xmath171)ptin . as the maximum measured magnetization for tbptin was around @xmath174tb@xmath47 ( far smaller than the calculated @xmath175 value ) , it is reasonable to assume the existence of more metamagnetic transitions beyond our maximum applied field @xmath66 kg .",
    "however , in the highly diluted compound , where , within our field and temperature ranges , we are only probing the paramagnetic state , the magnetization also reaches only @xmath176tb@xmath47 at the highest h. this is consistent with the @xmath177tb@xmath47 corresponding to a crystal - field limited saturated paramagnetic ( cl - spm ) state .",
    "consequently we chose our model based on three ising - systems such that it described the hexagonal symmetry of the compound having three magnetic ions in orthorhombic point symmetry , with the above value corresponding to saturation ( in the limit of high cef energy ) . in order to verify this hypothesis , the expected angular dependencies of possible moment configurations resulting from such a model",
    "will be compared with our measurements .",
    "furthermore , we will use our experimental results to refine the model , by considering multiples of the three ising - like systems , resulting in more complex angular dependencies of the calculated magnetization and critical field values .    in the @xmath178 space group",
    ", tbptin assumes a hexagonal crystal structure , with 3 tb@xmath47 ions at equivalent 3 g ( orthorhombic ) sites .",
    "the fact that a strong cef anisotropy confines the local moments to the basal plane calls for a two dimensional model , greatly simplifying the analysis .",
    "( a schematic description of an equivalent three - dimensional model has been introduced for dyagge@xcite ) .",
    "having three equivalent magnetic moments in orthorhombic point symmetry , one possible way to achieve the overall hexagonal symmetry is by restricting the moments to three of the six - fold symmetry axes , @xmath179 apart , while allowing for both the up ( solid arrows ) and down ( dotted arrows ) positions for a given direction ( fig.14 ) .",
    "any specific tb - site would , at low temperatures , behave like an ising system , with each third of the sites having parallel ising directions .",
    "thus , each metamagnetic state of tbptin can be described by a multiple s of three ising - like systems along three [ 120 ] equivalent directions ( the easy axes for this system ) .",

    "the order of the arrows is not meaningful for our model ; only the number of arrows for each orientation is significant for the net distribution of moments .",
    "moreover , we describe each metamagnetic state with the minimum - s value moment configuration consistent with the experimental data .",
    "however , higher s values are possible for most of the states , and information about the wave vectors ( _ e.g. _ from scattering experiments ) would be required to determine unique s values .    since in our experiments",

    "we restrict our model description to the @xmath193 angular region , which , by symmetry across the @xmath80 direction , also describes the @xmath194 region .    for @xmath195",
    ", our model corresponds to one set of three such ising - like systems .",
    "we assume that in high applied fields , the three magnetic moments occupy the three allowed easy axes closest to the direction of the field ; as the field is lowered , the metamagnetic transitions occur such that the measured magnetization is being decreased with h. in this hypothesis , there are three distinct moment configurations for the system : ( @xmath196 ) for the cl - spm state , ( @xmath197 ) for intermediate field values , and ( @xmath198 ) for the af ground state .",
    "the above formula yields the following angular dependencies of the resulting longitudinal ( measured ) magnetizations : @xmath199 , @xmath200 and @xmath201 respectively , represented by open circles in fig.15 .",
    "fig.13b shows that such a model only describes the cl - spm state @xmath202tb@xmath203 and the af ground state @xmath204tb@xmath205 of tbptin ; according to the proposed model , the local moment configurations from which the above angular dependencies follow are ( @xmath196 ) and ( @xmath198 ) respectively .",
    "it is worth noting that the cl - spm magnetization value , calculated based on the above moment configuration , is @xmath206 , smaller than the measured @xmath207 .",
    "one possible explanation is that with increasing field , the system is slowly approaching the cef splitting energy .",
    "this is also consistent with the increasing plateaus in the high field magnetization data in fig.5a ; however , the extrapolation of these plateaus down to @xmath208 results in smaller values for the [ 120 ] direction ( @xmath209 ) and the [ 110 ] direction ( @xmath210 ) , closer to the calculated values ( @xmath211 and @xmath212 respectively ) .    to characterize",
    "all the other observed metamagnetic states , larger s - values are needed , _",
    "i.e. _ the local moment configurations are described by an integer multiple @xmath213 of sets of three ising - like systems .",
    "fig.15 ( crosses ) also shows all possible angular dependencies of the magnetizations resulting from such a generalized model when @xmath214 . by comparison with the experimental data",

    "there is still one more metamagnetic state , @xmath129 , which can not be described within the @xmath214 model ; however , for most of the angular range , its magnetization has an angular dependence consistent with : @xmath221tb@xmath222 .",
    "the @xmath74 dependence ( _ i.e. _ @xmath223 is an even function ) requires that the moment configuration be symmetric with respect to the @xmath80 direction .",
    "the simplest possibility is ( @xmath196 ) , for which the magnetization varies as @xmath199 ; to this , a number of sets of three moments needs to be added , with zero net magnetization ( _ e.g. _ multiples of ( @xmath198 ) or ( @xmath224 ) ) , to get a resulting magnetization amplitude of @xmath225 .",
    "consequently a minimum @xmath226 configuration ( @xmath227 ) or ( @xmath228 ) yields the desired calculated magnetization @xmath229 .    assuming the above net distributions of moments for the observed metamagnetic states",
    ", one can derive the expected angular dependencies of the critical fields .",
    "comparison between the data in fig.13a and these calculated @xmath149 values will further confirm or refute the net distributions of moments proposed above .    since the energy associated with a magnetic moment @xmath230 in an applied field @xmath231 is @xmath232@xcite , the corresponding energy difference @xmath233 between metamagnetic states @xmath234 and @xmath235 is :    @xmath236    if there is a critical energy @xmath237 to be exceeded for a metamagnetic transition between states i and j to occur , than the critical field value is given by :    @xmath238 ,    where @xmath18 and @xmath239 are the measured ( projections along the field ) respective magnetizations .",
    "the numerator in the above expression is angle and field independent , and the angular dependence of @xmath19 follows only from the denominator . in other words ,",

    "similar to the analogous study in the tetragonal compound honi@xmath1b@xmath1c@xcite , in most cases we used maxima in @xmath87 , and not the on - set criterion , to determine the critical field values , because the magnetizations during the transition were not always linear ; however , comparison with the calculated critical fields based on the above model is still appropriate , given that only small departures from linearity were encountered , mostly close to the bordering states ( @xmath250 and @xmath173 ) .",
    "( the non - linear change of the magnetization with increasing field indicates that other factors ( _ i.e. _ the demagnetization factor of the sample@xcite , coexistence of more than two phases , non - linear superposition of the various states ) may be responsible for the broadening of the transition ) .",
    "comparison of the measured critical fields and locally saturated magnetizations ( fig.13a , b full and open symbols ) with the calculated values as described above ( fig.13a , b dotted lines ) confirms , in most cases , the assumed local distribution of moments .",
    "however , the first metamagnetic state @xmath129 follows well the calculated @xmath251tb@xmath252 dependence up to @xmath253 , after which it is difficult to determine it with reasonable accuracy .",
    "despite the fact that both @xmath150 and @xmath151 should depend on this magnetization value , the former follows the expected angular dependence fairly well , whereas the latter falls under the calculated @xmath15 curve .",
    "even though at this point we do nt have a rigorous calculation to support our assumption , we anticipate that the proximity of the two lowest transitions requires a calculation with more than two coexisting phases , which may render a better fit of the observed experimental data in this region .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath135 and @xmath136 critical fields , which have the most evident angular dependence , are well fitted by the calculated functions based on the present model .",
    "it is thus reasonable to assume that , whereas possibilities for refining the model exist , in the simple form that we present here it describes our system fairly well .",
    "the polar plot in fig.16 helps in understanding how the hexagonal crystal structure of this compound is reflected in the angular dependence of the metamagnetic phase transitions : similar to the polar phase diagrams for tetragonal compounds honi@xmath13b@xmath13c@xcite or dyagsb@xmath13@xcite , when we plot @xmath254 vs. @xmath255 , the phase boundaries become straight lines , with slopes equal to either @xmath256 or @xmath257 .",
    "these slopes correspond to directions either parallel or perpendicular to the high symmetry axes ( _ i.e. _ @xmath122 $ ] or @xmath104 $ ] ) in the hexagonal structure , just as within the four position clock model the corresponding phase lines were either parallel or perpendicular to the tetragonal high symmetry axes ( @xmath122 $ ] or @xmath258 $ ] ) .",
    "as described in myers _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite , the equations of these straight lines in polar coordinates can be used to verify the transitions already discussed : if we substitute the above slope values in the general formula    @xmath259 ,    for a line with slope b , we get :    @xmath260 for @xmath261    @xmath262 for @xmath263    or    @xmath264 for @xmath265 ,    which are consistent with the angular dependencies of the transitions determined above .    for the most part",
    ", the experimental points fall onto the calculated straight lines , as expected .",
    "some deviations from the straight lines can be noticed , with the most evident one for @xmath151 , for which we already emphasized the necessity of a more complex model . in a similar manner",
    "( even though only for fewer angles ) , @xmath135 curves under the calculated straight line as we move away from the [ 120 ] easy axis , while some even smaller deviations from linearity are apparent in @xmath150 ; this may indicate that special attention needs to be paid in determining the angular dependence of the critical fields , when rotating from the proximity of one easy axis to another .",
    "we already reported the basic magnetic properties of tmagge@xcite , which strongly resemble those of tbptin : the magnetic susceptibility is extremely anisotropic ( fig.17 ) , indicating antiferromagnetic order below @xmath266 k. the local magnetic moments are confined by the strong cef anisotropy to the basal plane , both below and above @xmath267 .",
    "this can also be seen in the field dependent magnetization measurements , shown in fig.18 , where in - plane anisotropy of the ordered state is also apparent .",
    "similar to the case of tbptin , several metamagnetic transitions exist for both @xmath85 $ ] and @xmath84 $ ] ; these result in magnetization values of @xmath268 and @xmath269 respectively , at @xmath270  kg , far below @xmath271tm@xmath272 , whereas for the c direction , the magnetization is linear and much smaller up to the maximum applied field .",

    "may be caused by the slow approach of the cef splitting energy .    in calculating the above expected magnetization values",
    ", we assumed the easy axes to be along the [ 110]-equivalent directions , based on the directions where maximum magnetization values at @xmath270  kg were achieved ( fig.18 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the angular dependent magnetization measurement for @xmath270  kg shown in fig.19 , where angle @xmath0 was measured from the [ 110 ] direction ; thus the six - fold symmetric magnetization has maxima occurring for the @xmath122$]-equivalent directions ( _ i.e. _ for @xmath275 , where _",
    "n _ is an integer ) .",
    "consequently , for tmagge the angle @xmath0 will be measured from the closest [ 110 ] easy axis .",
    "the comparison of tmagge and tbptin indicates that , even though the easy axes in the two compounds correspond to the two different sets of six - fold symmetry directions , as we shall see , their physical properties are very similar .    around each easy axis , these magnetization measurements follow the @xmath74 angular dependence ( the solid line in fig.19 ) , as expected within our proposed model .",
    "some differences between the experimental data ( filled circles in fig.19 ) and the calculated magnetization could be caused by small misalignment of the sample ( rendering slightly asymmetric measured peaks ) , or by the strong interactions between the local moments .",
    "similar to tbptin , this also indicates that different metamagnetic states cross @xmath270 kg at different angles .    from the @xmath276 ( fig.20 ) and @xmath277 ( fig.21 ) measurements ,",
    "detailed @xmath83 phase diagrams for this compound can be determined .",

    "also falls down in field as t increases , such that at very low fields only one transition is observed close to @xmath284 k.    as we rotate away from the easy axis , the low - field phase diagram changes very little , with a small enhancement of the critical field values towards low temperatures . as field",
    "is being increased , @xmath113 is getting smaller as a new distinct phase @xmath114 forms .",
    "its upper bordering line appears to have a strong angular dependence , as can be seen in fig.22b and c , similar to the upper - most phase boundary seen in tbptin : for @xmath84 $ ] ( fig.22c ) , this phase boundary is an almost vertical line at @xmath285k , up to our maximum applied field @xmath270 kg . as a consequence ,",
    "the corresponding points on this line have been determined from @xmath38 data , as shown in fig.20c for high fields , and could not be identified in the field - dependent derivatives . at low temperatures , the @xmath150 and @xmath151 values ( 3.62 kg and 4.86 kg respectively )",
    "are very close to the corresponding ones in the @xmath122 $ ] direction , whereas the @xmath113 to @xmath114 transition occurs around 7.0 kg .",
    "these three phase lines merge around @xmath286 k , such that for higher temperatures a single transition occurs at decreasing fields .",
    "this line appears to intersect the @xmath287 axis around @xmath284 k.    the intermediate - orientation phase diagram presented in fig.22b allowed us to observe the upper - most phase line moving down in field at low temperatures , such that for @xmath279 , it intersects the @xmath288 axis close to 40.1 kg . in this orientation",
    ", this phase boundary can be identified in the m(h ) derivative , as shown in fig.23 for @xmath137 k. however , the high field peak in @xmath87 is poorly defined , making the determination of the corresponding critical field value more difficult . for a more precise estimate , another criterium was used together with the derivative maxima , as illustrated in the inset in fig.23 : the mid - point ( large dot ) on the highest - slope linear fit ( solid line ) of the magnetization data around the transition .",
    "also shown is the error bar for this critical field value , as determined from the two criteria used here .    the fact that this line is now apparent in both @xmath118 and @xmath59 data is further confirmation that this phase boundary exists , whereas at lower fields , the only noticeable difference from the @xmath84 $ ] direction is the persistence of the @xmath113 state up to higher ( _ i.e. _ @xmath289 k ) temperatures .",
    "a number of similarities between tbptin and tmagge have already been established : same crystal structure , antiferromagnetic ground state , extremely anisotropic magnetization , in - plane anisotropy and metamagnetism leading to crystal field - limited saturated magnetizations smaller than the calculated single ion @xmath290 values . as a consequence ,",
    "we proceed to study the angular dependence of the planar metamagnetism in tmagge , and subsequently apply the model developed for tbptin to the case of this compound .",
    "when we fix the temperature at @xmath73 k , the angular dependence of the metamagnetic transitions can be studied based on the @xmath59 isotherms shown in fig.24 .",
    "the critical fields and the locally saturated magnetization values ( full symbols in fig.25 ) have been determined as maxima in @xmath87 , and from on - set values respectively ( see the tbptin section ) .",
    "an exception was made for @xmath152 above @xmath34 , and the criterion used for determining this state is described below . moreover , because of the proximity of the first two transitions , the @xmath129 state is poorly defined ; no precise saturated magnetization data could be extracted for this state , but the phase diagrams in fig.22 , as well as the angular dependent critical fields in fig.25a , are consistent with the existence of this phase . as before , the open symbols in fig.25 represent reflections of the measured data across the @xmath80 direction .",
    "the tmagge measurements allowed us to determine the critical field and locally saturated magnetization values for the full angular range ( @xmath188 ) ; the resulting somewhat asymmetric data ( most obvious in the case of the @xmath113 data ) maybe due to a small sample misalignment .",
    "the experimental data ( full symbols ) together with the reflections ( open symbols ) in fig.25 give the caliper of the error bars for these measurements .",
    "for @xmath291 , two closely spaced metamagnetic transitions can be seen in fig.25a , with critical fields @xmath292 kg and @xmath293 kg respectively at @xmath32 , followed by a third transition @xmath294 at @xmath295 kg .",
    "it should be noted that these @xmath19 values are slightly different from the corresponding ones ( 3.10 kg , 4.36 kg and 8.92 kg respectively at @xmath296 k , @xmath80 ) in the @xmath83 phase diagrams ( fig.22a ) , as they have been determined from two distinct measurements .",
    "thus small errors in the angular position ( @xmath297 ) may convert into small errors in the critical field values ( @xmath298 ) .",
    "somewhat larger differences between the two data sets are observed for @xmath299 , specifically for @xmath136 , which varies more rapidly with the angle than any other critical field . in this angular region ,",
    "the two lower transitions occur at almost the same critical fields as below @xmath34 , whereas the critical field for the third one slowly decreases with angle , as a fourth transition appears and rapidly moves up in field .",
    "consequently , the @xmath129 metamagnetic state changes little with the angle , whereas the @xmath113 state narrows down as the bordering critical fields move closer to each other .",
    "the fourth transition being very broad makes the determination of the @xmath114 state fairly difficult .",
    "also , with @xmath136 broadening out and rapidly moving towards our field limit ( _ i.e. _ 70 kg ) , it was difficult to get a meaningful linear fit of the @xmath59 curves during the @xmath114 to @xmath131 transition ; instead we used the intersection of the maximum slope line corresponding to the @xmath113 to @xmath114 transition , and the best linear fit of the highest magnetization state , to determine @xmath152 for @xmath300 ( fig.24b , inset ) .",
    "the best fits to the experimentally measured angular dependent data are shown in fig.25 as dotted lines .",
    "we will use these fits to infer the net distribution of moments as multiples s of three ising - like systems , similar to the case of tbptin . as mentioned before , we infer that the @xmath129 state should exist based on the angular dependent critical fields in fig.25a , and the @xmath296 k metamagnetic phases revealed by the phase diagrams in fig.22 . consequently , in fig.25b we are only showing the expected angular dependence of such a phase , by analogy with the tbptin case : @xmath301tm@xmath302 , which appears to be the upper limit of these magnetization values , as indicated by the error bars shown in fig.25b . as already seen for tbptin , the moment configuration that would result in such a @xmath129 magnetization is a @xmath226 state : ( @xmath227 ) or ( @xmath228 ) .",
    "@xmath303 has a maximum value at @xmath32 equal to @xmath304tm@xmath47 , close to @xmath305tm@xmath47 , and a @xmath74 angular dependence .",

    "if one local moment is flipped from its @xmath185 position to @xmath182 in the previous state , the resulting state could be described by the ( @xmath306 ) configuration , whose magnetization varies as @xmath307tm@xmath308 ; this fits well the measured @xmath114 data , indicating that the previously assumed local moment distribution may be appropriate for this metamagnetic state . when all the magnetic moments are in their up positions , the cl - spm ( @xmath309 ) state is achieved , and the corresponding angular dependence is @xmath310tm@xmath10 .",
    "this best describes the last observed metamagnetic state , which has a maximum of @xmath311tm@xmath47 around @xmath32 , very close to @xmath310tm@xmath312tm@xmath47 .",

    "describe the locally saturated magnetization states , we expect the following angular dependencies of the critical fields :    @xmath241 ,    @xmath242    @xmath243 ,    @xmath313    and @xmath245 .",
    "the experimental data ( full symbols in fig.25a ) are in good agreement with these calculated critical fields , with @xmath314 present only for @xmath291 , while the @xmath135 and @xmath136 exist only for @xmath300 .",
    "this is consistent with the presence of the @xmath114 state for angles larger than @xmath36 , even though experimentally we were only able to accurately determine it for @xmath315 .",
    "( the bordering transitions of this state are very close in field when @xmath0 is close to @xmath36 , which made the determination of @xmath114 in this angular region difficult ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out the excellent fit of the measured @xmath136 data with the calculated angular dependency , this transition showing the most dramatic change with the angle @xmath0 .",
    "apart from the absolute values of the critical fields and the locally saturated magnetizations , the @xmath316 and @xmath317 phase diagrams for tmagge ( fig.25 ) are identical to the tbptin analogues in fig.13 : to the same number of critical fields with identical angular dependencies correspond identical metamagnetic values ( scaled to the saturated moment of the respective r@xmath47 ion ) , which also vary similarly with the angle .",
    "this is consistent with our model being indeed a general description of the fe@xmath1p - type systems , or even more generally , of hexagonal systems with the r in orthorhombic point symmetry .",
    "when the @xmath316 phase diagram for tmagge is converted into a polar plot ( fig.26 ) , similar to that for tbptin , we again notice that the phase boundaries are straight lines , with @xmath256 or @xmath257 slopes . from the equations of these straight lines ,",
    "we can once more confirm the transitions determined before :    @xmath260 for @xmath261    @xmath262 for @xmath263    or    @xmath264 for @xmath265 .",
    "as already noted , in the case of tmagge , we were able to determine the critical fields from experimental data for @xmath318 , as seen in the phase diagrams in fig.25a , as well as in fig.26 .",
    "slight differences between the expected straight lines in fig.26 and measured critical fields can be noticed for @xmath135 for angles close to @xmath319 , or for @xmath136 also for large angles ; besides being a consequence of small misorientation of the sample , this may indicate , similar to the tbptin case , that a more complex model needs to be used to describe the regions around the hard in - plane direction .",
    "whereas tmagge has fairly simple @xmath83 phase diagrams , with all metamagnetic phases present at low temperatures , the tbptin phase diagrams are somewhat more complex , manifesting an additional intermediate - temperature phase , @xmath320 ( fig.9 ) . in order to perform a similar angular dependent study of this metamagnetic state , a set of @xmath321 data",

    "it should be noted that , due to the enhanced temperature , all transitions are broadened , and the locally saturated magnetization plateaus are no longer horizontal .",
    "both of these facts make the analysis of these data somewhat harder and more ambiguous .    for @xmath322 ( fig.28a ) , the lowest transition changes very little with angle , having a critical field value @xmath323 kg .",
    "as field is being increased , two more transitions can be observed for angles lower than @xmath324 , with local minima of the critical fields , at @xmath80 , of @xmath325 kg and @xmath326 kg respectively . for larger angles ,",

    "it should be noted that we are still referring to the high - field state at @xmath5 k as the crystal field - limited saturated paramagnetic cl - spm state , even though it is possible that cross - over to the paramagnetic pm state has occurred between 2 k and 20 k at high h. ( this would be a plausible explanation for the measured magnetization values for this high field state being , as seen below , lower than the calculated values . )    the locally saturated magnetization of the @xmath320 state is equal to @xmath330 tb at @xmath80 and does nt appear to change much with the angle . according to the @xmath83 phase diagrams in fig.9 , all higher metamagnetic states are identical at low ( @xmath73 k ) temperature and at @xmath5 k ; consequently , they seem to have similar angular dependencies ( fig.28b ) : @xmath113 and @xmath152 have local maxima around @xmath331 tb and @xmath332 tb respectively , at @xmath80 , and slowly decrease with increasing angle in this region . beyond @xmath333 ,",

    "also , we can now see the third state @xmath114 slowly increasing with angle @xmath0 , similar to the low temperature case .",
    "the @xmath5 k phase diagrams ( fig.28 ) are very similar to their low temperature analogues ( fig.13 ) , except for the @xmath320 state , and some evident differences between the experimental data and the model calculations ( dotted lines ) .",
    "it was rather difficult to determine the angular dependencies of @xmath320 and @xmath113 , therefore we had to infer the possible theoretical fits in a more indirect way : as we already mentioned , the state described by @xmath113 at @xmath5 k should be the same as the corresponding one at low temperature , since they characterize the same metamagnetic phase",
    ". therefore we expect it to vary with the angle like @xmath335tb@xmath10 ( fig.13b ) . for large angles ,",
    "this is consistent with the measured data in fig.28b , whereas significant deviations can be noticed closer to @xmath80 .",
    "the lower magnetization state @xmath320 has much smaller values than any of the states characterized at @xmath73 k , therefore we can not fit it accurately with a calculated angular dependence ; however , @xmath336 can be fitted with 16.2 kg @xmath337 and should relate to @xmath320 through    @xmath338 $ ]    or    @xmath339tb@xmath340 $ ] .",
    "thus @xmath341 should vary like @xmath342 , with a locally saturated magnetization @xmath343tb@xmath344 , but , as already mentioned , it is difficult to determine it with reasonable accuracy .",
    "however , the corresponding local moment configuration should be similar to the low temperature one , in order to get the @xmath345 dependence , except that the number s of three ising - like systems which would yield the appropriate @xmath346 value is uncertain .",
    "all other locally saturated magnetizations and critical fields can be best fitted with the same angular dependencies as for the low temperature case :    @xmath347tb@xmath348 ,    @xmath349tb@xmath10 ,    and    @xmath350 ,    @xmath351 ,    @xmath352 ,    @xmath313 .",
    "apart from the already mentioned differences between the measured data and the calculated curves , small departures from the corresponding theoretical angular dependencies can be noticed for @xmath353 and @xmath135 ; a more significant difference appears for the saturated magnetization state @xmath354 , which seems to have the expected angular dependence , but with smaller values than the calculated ones .",
    "this may be a high - temperature effect ( _ i.e. _ cross - over from low - t cl - spm state to high - t paramagnetic pm state ) , or it may be one more indication that a more refined model is needed .",
    "a polar plot analogues to the low temperature case ( fig.29 ) shows that at @xmath5 k , the critical fields are still well described by straight lines , but with more pronounced differences between experiment and the theoretical calculations .",
    "we attribute these to the thermal broadening at this temperature , but , as already seen in the low temperature case , a requirement for a more complex model can not be excluded .",
    "motivated by the extensive work done on highly anisotropic local moment systems with tetragonal unit cells and unique rare earth sites of tetragonal point symmetry , we have performed detailed studies on two highly anisotropic , local moment , hexagonal compounds : tbptin and tmagge .",
    "whereas both of these compounds are ternary members of the fe@xmath1p class of materials , they have different ligands .",
    "in addition , whereas both of these compounds manifest extreme planar anisotropy , they have different easy axes : @xmath104 $ ] for tbptin and @xmath122 $ ] for tmagge .",
    "even with these differences we have found that these two compounds have very similar @xmath83 as well as @xmath355 phase diagrams .",
    "tbptin and tmagge have a single rare earth site with orthorhombic point symmetry ( with three rare earth sites per unit cell ) and both compounds have high field saturated moments well below the single ion values .",
    "these two observations , combined with our experience with the four position clock model that was developed for the tetragonal compounds with rare earths in tetragonal symmetry , lead us to propose a similar model for these fe@xmath1p - type compounds : a triple coplanar ising model , which consists of three ising - like moments per unit cell , with their ising axes within the basal plane and rotated by @xmath8 with respect to each other .",
    "this model preserves the six - fold symmetry at high fields and also explains why the saturated moments are significantly lower than the free ion values . by analyzing the magnitudes and angular dependencies of the critical metamagnetic fields , as well as the locally saturated magnetizations within the framework of this model",
    ", we can infer the net distribution of moments along the six possible moment orientations .",
    "however , field - dependent neutron diffraction or magnetic x - ray measurements are needed to test these hypothetical net distributions of moments and to obtain the propagation vectors for each magnetically ordered state .",
    "( some preliminary experiments on tbptin are already reported@xcite , confirming the two low - field ordering temperatures that we observed in the magnetization measurements .",
    "moreover , the neutron data are consistent with our inferred direction of the moments . )    the successful extension of the four state clock model to the current triple coplanar ising - like model implies that a wider set of local moment compounds with planar anisotropy can be understood in a similarly simple manner .",
    "clearly tetragonal unit cell compounds with the rare earth in orthorhombic point symmetry could be expected to behave in a manner similar to tbptin and tmagge , _",
    "i.e. _ to form a class of double coplanar ising model materials . in a similar manner , hexagonal unit cell compounds with the rare earth in hexagonal point symmetry could be expected to behave in a manner similar to honi@xmath1b@xmath1c@xcite or dyagsb@xmath1@xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ to form a class of six position clock model materials .",
    "hexagonal unit cell materials may offer one other , potentially new class of materials : highly planar anisotropic compounds with the rare earth in trigonal point symmetry . in this case",
    "we anticipate a double coplanar three position clock model .",
