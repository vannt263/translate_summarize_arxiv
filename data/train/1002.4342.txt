    "the taub  nut solution of the vacuum einstein equations exhibits intriguing properties",
    ". the double name of the solution originates from the two parts the solution consists of , and at the same time highlights its strange features . in 1951",
    "taub  @xcite derived a solution valid in the `` inner '' region ( @xmath0 , see eq .  ) , which was interpreted as a cosmological model ( see e.g.  brill  @xcite and wheeler  @xcite ) . in 1963 independently newman , unti and tamburino ( nut )  @xcite obtained a metric valid in the `` outer '' region ( @xmath1 ) which reduces to the schwarzschild metric in the limit of vanishing nut parameter .",
    "misner  @xcite then suggested to consider the taub space ",
    "time joined analytically to the nut space  time as a single taub ",
    "nut space  time .",
    "the gravitomagnetic properties of the taub  nut space ",
    "time are determined by the nondiagonal part of the metric , which features the nut parameter @xmath2 as a gravitomagnetic charge .",
    "this nondiagonal term implicates a singularity on the half - axis @xmath3 , termed `` misner string '' , which is distinct from the ordinary coordinate singularity associated with the use of spherical coordinates .",
    "misner  @xcite suggested to evade this singularity , by introducing a periodic time coordinate and two coordinate patches .",
    "the first coordinate patch covers the northern hemisphere and the singularity is located along the axis @xmath3 , while the second patch covers the southern hemisphere with the singularity extending along the axis @xmath4 .",
    "( this construction is analogous to the way in which the `` dirac string '' singularity in the vector potential of the abelian magnetic monopole is eliminated . )",
    "a periodic time coordinate is thus the price to be paid for a taub  nut space  time free of these axial singularities .",
    "indeed , this _ periodic identification _ of the time coordinate makes the solution look rather problematic for physical applications because of the resulting causality violations .",
    "noting that every observer at rest in the coordinate system would move on a closed time - like world - line , bonnor  @xcite was led to suggest an alternative interpretation of the metric , in order to evade this unsatisfactory property of the misner interpretation of the taub ",
    "nut space  time . in his approach bonnor retained the singularity at @xmath3 , and endowed it with a physical meaning : he interpreted it as a semi  infinite massless rotating rod . in his interpretation the nut space ",
    "time is then considered as being created by a spherically symmetric body of mass @xmath5 at the origin and by a source of pure angular momentum ( associated with the nut parameter ) which is uniformly distributed along the @xmath3axis .",
    "thus the `` misner string '' is representing a physical singularity .",
    "moreover , close to the singular semi - axis there looms a region of space  time containing closed time - like curves .",
    "consequently , to obtain a physically more reasonable interpretation of the taub - nut solution , bonnor was forced to restrict the coordinate range , as to exclude the singular regions along with the region with closed time - like curves .",
    "containing holes , the resulting manifold is then incomplete in the sence that not all geodesics can be extended to arbitrarily large values of their affine parameters @xcite .",
    "recently , manko and ruiz  @xcite reconsidered the interpretation of bonnor for the general family of taub - nut solutions , containing a constant @xmath6 in the nondiagonal part of the metric , @xmath7 .",
    "this constant then defines the position of the singularity on the axis of the respective taub - nut space  time . for the special cases , when @xmath8 or @xmath9 ( as considered in  @xcite ) there is only a single semi - infinite singularity on the upper or lower part of the symmetry axis , respectively .",
    "all other @xmath6values correspond to taub - nut solutions with two semi - infinite singularities .",
    "the general source associated with these singularities is then interpreted as two semi - infinite counter - rotating rods ( or only a single semi - infinite rotating rod in the special cases @xmath10 ) with a finite rod ( also rotating in general ) inbetween them .",
    "the total mass of the nut solutions is @xmath5 and does not depend on the choice of @xmath6 . in particular",
    ", none of the rods yields a divergent contribution to the total mass . for the choice @xmath11 ,",
    "the angular momentum of the middle rod @xmath12 vanishes , and the diverging angular momenta @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the semi - infinite rods cancel each other .",
    "the analysis of manko and ruiz is based on the exact calculation of the komar integrals for the mass and the angular momentum of the three rods constituting the nut source and their total values .",
    "the unattractive properties of the bonnor interpretation are thus retained for this general family of taub - nut solutions : the axial singularity and the closed time - like curves in its vicinity .",
    "presuming the _ periodic identification _ of the time coordinate , misner and taub  @xcite explored the geodesics of the taub - nut space  time and detected the presence of incomplete geodesics .",
    "this may seem surprising , since the origin and the axis are regular in their interpretation of the space  time .",
    "however , employing eddington - finkelstein coordinates , misner and taub found a singular behaviour of some geodesics at the horizons : as one of the horizons is approached for the second time , the modified time coordinate diverges and the affine parameter terminates , thus making these geodesics incomplete .",
    "now the same type of behaviour is found for geodesics in the reissner - nordstrm space  time , and is dealt with by analytical continuation of the reissner - nordstrm space ",
    "time at the horizons , which consequently allows the continuation of these respective geodesics .",
    "the obvious question following from this observation is therefore whether the taub - nut space  time can be analytically continued in an analogous fashion as the reissner - nordstrm space  time .    indeed , in 1971 miller ,",
    "kruskal and godfrey  @xcite applied kruskal - like coordinates and provided an analytic extension of the taub - nut metric for the entire range of @xmath15values .",
    "consequently , in their approach the geodesics , which previously terminated at a horizon , could in principle be extended in these new coordinates .",
    "they would no longer be incomplete .",
    "however , the analytic extension introduced in @xcite came at the prize that the periodic identification of the time coordinate was no longer possible , since it would violate the hausdorff property of the manifold . consequently , without the periodic identification the singularities on the axis are not evaded , and therefore the extension of miller , kruskal and godfrey  @xcite is geodesically incomplete , as they note .",
    "leaving aside the incompleteness of certain classes of geodesics , which apparently can not be avoided in either interpretation of the vacuum taub - nut space ",
    "time , let us now address some further interesting aspects of this space  time .",
    "first of all we note , that the geodesics of the taub - nut space  time share many of the properties of the trajectories of charged particles in the field of a magnetic monopole . a thorough discussion and comparison of these orbits can be found in zimmerman and shahir  @xcite .",
    "one particular such property is , that test particles always move on a cone .",
    "this was also pointed out by lynden - bell and nouri - zonos  @xcite , who studied a newtonian analogue of monopole space ",
    "times and discussed the observational possibilities for ( gravito)magnetic monopoles .",
    "in fact , the spectra of supernovae , quasars or agn might be good candidates to infer the existence of ( gravito)magnetic monopoles .",
    "on the other hand , the lack of observational evidence for the existence of gravitomagnetic masses might be explained by its presumably very large value  @xcite , and by not sufficiently sensitive instruments  @xcite .",
    "zonos and lynden ",
    "bell  @xcite suggested to look for gravitomagnetic masses by means of gravitational lensing . by considering the propagation of light in taub  nut space ",
    "time they showed that the nut deflector influences the gravitational lensing effect on the null geodesics .",
    "in contrast to the lensing in schwarzschild space  times , the gravitomagnetic field shears the observed form of the source .",
    "the possibility to detect and the method to measure the gravitomagnetic masses with the next generation of microlensing experiments was studied in  @xcite . in  @xcite even the anomalous acceleration of the pioneer spacecraft was associated with a gravitomagnetic charge .",
    "we present in this paper the complete set of analytic solutions of the geodesic equation in taub - nut space  times in terms of the weierstra elliptic functions ( the complete set of analytical solutions of the geodesic equation in plebaski ",
    "demiaski space - times which taub  nut is a special case of , can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "we classify the orbits by means of the analysis of the underlying polynomials which include the parameters of the metric and the physical quantities characterizing the test particles . in particular , we discuss the incomplete geodesics , arising in eddington  finkelstein coordinates , as one of the horizons is approached for the second time , and we address the analytic extension of the space ",
    "time necessary to extend the geodesics , but forcing us to retain the singularity on the axis .",
    "we also discuss observable effects in taub  nut space ",
    "times on the basis of analytically defined observables , thus making other approaches to experimental signals of the nut parameter , e.g. @xcite , more rigorous .",
