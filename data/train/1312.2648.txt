    "one of the most astonishing theoretical predictions of quantum electrodynamic ( qed ) is a finding that the vacuum in a strong external field is unstable and will decay into electron - positron pairs .",
    "this process as one of the most interesting phenomena in strong field physics had been studied several decades ago . after the earlier work of sauter @xcite and heisenberg @xcite , schwinger @xcite first got the vacuum pair production rate in constant electric field by calculating the imaginary part of one loop effective lagrangian in the middle of last century and obtained the critical electric field strength @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the charge and rest mass of electrons",
    ", @xmath5 is the speed of light in vacuum , and @xmath6 is the planck constant .",
    "this critical electric field strength corresponds to the laser intensity of @xmath7 .",
    "now the electron - positron pair production from vacuum is also called schwinger mechanism .    since schwinger s pioneering study many works have been done including the new research methods and the different forms of external fields .",
    "for example , the employed methods include the semiclassical one , such as wkb approximation @xcite and worldline instanton technique @xcite , and the quantum kinetic method , such as quantum vlasov equation ( qve ) @xcite and wigner formalism @xcite . by using these methods , schwinger mechanism for spatially homogenous but time - dependent electric fields and inhomogenous",
    "static electric fields with or without a constant magnetic field have been investigated .",
    "although many theoretical works are performed , however , the experimental observation of this mechanism is still a challenging task .",
    "recent years , as the rapid development of laser technology , hopes for realizing schwinger mechanism in laboratory are rekindled .",
    "now the ultrahigh intensity laser facilities which are building such as the extreme light infrastructure ( eli ) @xcite and the european x - ray free electron laser ( xfel ) @xcite are possible to approach the subcritical field strength , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "nevertheless , due to the exponentially suppression of schwinger mechanism , which can be regarded as tunneling effect , the number of produced pairs in a subcritical field is very small . to improve the pair creation number , some catalytic mechanisms",
    "are suggested in the future experiment @xcite . among them ,",
    "the dynamical assist schwinger mechanism draws an attention @xcite . in subcritical field regime , by superimposing a weak strength but rapidly varying electric field ( dominated by multiphoton mechanism ) on a strong strength but slowly varying one ( dominated by schwinger mechanism ) , the number of produced particles can be enhanced greatly , while both of these two fields have a suppressed pair creation number when they are considered respectively .",
    "moreover , this effect is also generalized to more realistic laser pulse with the optimization of electric fields @xcite .",
    "in addition , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the time - dependent multiple - slit interference effect for schwinger mechanism is studied .",
    "it is found that the maxima of longitudinal momentum spectrum can reach @xmath9 times the single pulse profile for alternating - sign @xmath0-pulse electric field because its coherent enhancement effect .",
    "it seems a good candidate to realize the schwinger mechanism in laboratory .",
    "the propose of this work is to generalize the dynamical assist effect and the multiple - slit interference effect in electron - positron pair production to charged scalar boson pair production . for the former effect",

    "the combination fields constitute by a strong but slowly varying electric field and a weak but rapidly varying one with different time delays . for the latter effect",
    ", we investigate it in equal - sign and alternating - sign electric field pulse train . we give the exact turning points of alternating - sign @xmath1-pulse electric field and use them to calculate the approximate solution of momentum spectrum in both @xmath1-pulse and @xmath0-pulse electric field .",
    "a simple expression of approximate solution in alternating - sign @xmath0-pulse electric field for boson pair production is also got . for both of two effects ,",
    "the different physical properties of bosons and fermions are shown by comparing their longitudinal momentum spectra of created particles .",

    "ii , from klein - gordon equation we simply deduce a riccati equation and give an approximate solution of momentum distribution function for boson pair production in the frame of quantum mechanical scattering model . in sec .",

    "the longitudinal momentum spectra of bosons and fermions are compared with each other .",
    "section iv gives the discussions and conclusions for our results .",
    "here we consider a standing - wave electric field produced by two counter propagating laser pulses .",

    "<S> based on the quantum mechanical scattering model , the dynamical assist effect and the multiple - slit interference effect in electron - positron pair production from vacuum are generalized to vacuum pair production of charged scalar bosons . for the former effect </S>",
    "<S> some combinations of a strong but slowly varying electric field and a weak but rapidly varying one with different time delay are studied . </S>",
    "<S> results indicate that the oscillation intensity of momentum spectrum and the number density of created bosons reduce with increasing of the time delay . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , they achieve the maximum if the time delay equals zero . for the latter effect </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that this effect does not exist for equal - sign @xmath0-pulse electric field in contrast to its existence for alternating - sign @xmath0-pulse . </S>",
    "<S> an approximate solution of boson momentum spectrum is got and it is agreeable well with the exact numerical one in alternating - sign @xmath0-pulse electric field , especially for @xmath1-pulse field and for small longitudinal momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the difference of vacuum pair production between bosons and fermions are also compared for their longitudinal momentum spectra .    _ </S>",
