    "the quest for the elementary constituents from which the matter around us is built has always fascinated mankind . in the fifth century b.c .",
    ", greek philosophers introduced the notion of an _ indivisible _ entity of matter , the @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4@xmath5@xmath4@xmath6 ( atom ) .",
    "more than 2000 years passed before this concept was systematized in the nineteenth century in terms of the chemical elements as the building blocks of the known substances .",
    "the large variety of the chemical elements , however , called for a deeper substructure within these atoms , which were soon revealed as bound states of negatively charged electrons ( @xmath7 ) and positively charged atomic nuclei , held together by their mutual attraction provided by the electromagnetic force . the nuclei , while very small in size ( but carrying about 99% of the atom s mass ) , were found to further decompose in positively charged protons ( @xmath8 ) and uncharged neutrons ( @xmath9 ) , both of approximately equal mass , @xmath10  gev/@xmath11 .",
    "this was a great achievement , since at this point all matter was reduced to 3 particles : @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath7 .",
    "there was still the problem of the stability of the atomic nucleus , since packing together many positive charges ( protons ) in a small region of space obviously implies a large electric repulsion .",
    "the solution to this problem triggered the discovery of the strong nuclear force acting between nucleons ( protons and neutrons ) ; it turned out to be a factor of @xmath12100 stronger than the electromagnetic one , but with a very short range of only a few femtometer ( 1  fm=10@xmath13  m ) . in the 1950 s and 1960 s , rapid progress in particle accelerator technology opened new energy regimes in collision experiments of subatomic particles ( e.g. , @xmath8-@xmath8 collisions ) .",
    "as a result , many more particles interacting via the strong force ( so - called hadrons ) were produced and discovered , including `` strange '' hadrons characterized by a for strongly interacting particles untypically long lifetime .",
    "again , this proliferation of states ( the `` hadron zoo '' ) called for yet another simplification in terms of hadronic substructure .",
    "gell - mann introduced three types of `` quarks ''  @xcite as the elementary constituents from which all known hadrons could be built ; they were dubbed up ( @xmath14 ) , down ( @xmath15 ) and strange ( @xmath16 ) quarks , with fractional electric charges + 2/3 , -1/3 and -1/3 , respectively . in this scheme ,",
    "hadrons are either built from 3 quarks ( forming baryons , e.g. , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , or a quark and an antiquark ( forming mesons , e.g. , @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) ) .",
    "three more heavy quark `` flavors '' , carrying significantly larger masses than the light quarks ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , were discovered in the 1970 s  charm ( @xmath21 ) and bottom ( @xmath22 )  as well as in 1995  the top ( @xmath23 ) quark .",
    "the discovery of an increasingly deeper structure of the fundamental matter particles is intimately related to the question of their mutual forces which , after all , determine how the variety of observed composite particles is built up .",
    "the understanding of fundamental _ interactions _ is thus of no less importance than the identification of the matter constituents .",
    "the modern theoretical framework to provide a unified description are quantum field theories ( qfts ) , which combine the principles of quantum mechanics with those of special relativity . in qfts , charged matter particles ( fermions of half - integer spin ) interact via the exchange of field quanta ( bosons with integer spin ) .",
    "the qft of the electromagnetic force is quantum electro - dynamics ( qed ) , where the associated field quantum is the photon ( @xmath24 ) coupling to electric charges ( positive ) and anticharges ( negative ) .",
    "the coupling constant ( or charge ) of qed is rather small , @xmath25=1/137 , which allows one to organize theoretical calculations in a series of terms characterized by increasing powers of @xmath26 , so - called perturbation theory .",
    "the smallness of @xmath26 then allows for precise perturbative calculations of electromagnetic observables with an accuracy exceeding ten significant digits for select quantities , rendering qed one of the most successful theories in physics .",
    "the qft of the strong nuclear force , quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) , has been developed in the early 1970 s  @xcite .",
    "the chromo ( = color ) charge of quarks comes in three variants : red , green and blue ( plus their anticharges ) , rendering qcd a mathematically more involved theory .",
    "in particular , the force quanta ( `` gluons '' ) themselves carry a nonzero ( color- ) charge  @xcite , giving rise to gluon self - interactions .",
    "the latter are closely related to another remarkable property of qcd , namely the `` anti - screening '' of its charges in the vacuum : quantum fluctuations , i.e. , the virtual quark - gluon cloud around a color charge , induces an increase of the effective charge with increasing distance , a phenomenon known as asymptotic freedom which manifests itself in the running coupling constant ( or charge ) of qcd , @xmath27 , cf .",
    "[ fig_alphas ] .    , on the momentum transfer , @xmath28 ( or inverse distance @xmath29 ) , of the interaction .",
    "figure taken from ref",
    ".  @xcite . ]    on the one hand , the interactions at small distances , @xmath30 ( which , by means of heisenberg s uncertainty principle , corresponds to large momentum transfers , @xmath31 , in a scattering process ) , are comparatively weak and perturbation theory is applicable ( much like in qed ) . in this regime ,",
    "qcd is well tested , being in excellent agreement with experiment ( albeit not at the same level of precision as qed ; even at very large @xmath28 , @xmath32 is still a factor of @xmath1210 larger than @xmath26 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the coupling constant grows toward small @xmath28 entering the realm of `` strong qcd '' where new _ nonperturbative _ phenomena occur .",
    "most notably these are the confinement of color charges and the `` spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry '' ( sbcs ) .",
    "the former refers to the fact that quarks and gluons have never been observed as individual particles , but only come in `` colorless '' baryons ( where the 3 quarks carry an equal amount of the 3 different color charges ) or mesons ( where quark and antiquark carry color charge and anticharge ) .",
    "spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is closely related to the complex structure of the qcd vacuum ; the latter is filled with various condensates of quark - antiquark and gluon fields .",
    "in particular , the scalar quark condensate of up and down quarks can be quantified by a vacuum expectation value , @xmath33 , translating into a total pair density of about 4 per @xmath34 .",
    "( planck s constant ) , @xmath21 ( speed of light ) and @xmath35 ( boltzmann constant ) ; in these units , energies , e.g. , can be converted into inverse distance by division with @xmath36  mevfm ; energies are also equivalent to temperature . ]",
    "thus , the qcd vacuum is a rather dense state , and the quarks inside the hadrons propagating through it acquire an effective mass , @xmath37  mev , which is much larger than their bare mass , @xmath38-@xmath39 .",
    "the qcd condensates are thus the main source of the visible ( baryonic ) mass in the universe .",
    "the theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underlying confinement and sbcs , and their possible interrelation , constitutes a major challenge in contemporary particle and nuclear physics research .",
    "currently , the only way to obtain first - principle information on this nonperturbative realm of qcd is through numerical lattice - discretized computer simulations ( lattice qcd ) .",
    "however , even with modern day computing power , the numerical results of lattice qcd computations for observable quantities are often hampered by statistical and systematic errors ( e.g. , due to finite volume and discretization effects ) ; the use of effective models is thus an indispensable tool for a proper interpretation and understanding of lattice qcd results , and to provide connections to experiment .",
    "a particularly fascinating aspect of the strong force is the question of what kind of matter ( or phases of matter ) it gives rise to .",
    "the conventional phases of matter ( such as solid , liquid and gas phases of the chemical elements and their compounds , or even electron - ion plasmas ) are , in principle , entirely governed by the electromagnetic force .",
    "matter governed by the strong force is `` readily '' available only in form of atomic nuclei : the understanding of these ( liquid - like ) droplets of nuclear matter ( characterized by a mass density of @xmath40 ) is a classical research objective of nuclear physics .",
    "but what happens to nuclear matter under extreme compression and/or heating ?",
    "what happens to the ( composite ) nucleons ?",
    "is it possible to produce truly elementary - particle matter where nucleons have dissolved into their quark ( and gluon ) constituents ( as may be expected from the asymptotic freedom , i.e. , small coupling constant , of the quark and gluon interactions at short distance ) ? does the condensate structure of the qcd vacuum melt , similar to the condensate of cooper pairs in a superconductor at sufficiently high temperature ?",
    "are there phase transitions associated with these phenomena ?",
    "the investigation of these questions not only advances our knowledge of strong qcd ( including the fundamental problems of confinement and mass generation ) , but also directly relates to the evolution of the early universe , as well as to the properties of extremely compact stellar objects ( so - called neutron stars ) .",
    "lattice - qcd computations at finite temperature indeed predict that hadronic matter undergoes a transition to a state of matter where quarks and gluons are no longer confined into hadrons .",
    "the temperature required to induce this transition into the `` quark - gluon plasma '' ( qgp ) is approximately @xmath41  ev , or @xmath42 .",
    "the universe is believed to have passed through this transition at about 10@xmath43 ( = 0.00001@xmath16 ) after its birth .",
    "this was , however , @xmath12 15 billion years ago , and the question arises how one can possibly study the qgp , or more generally the phase diagram of qcd matter , today  @xcite .",
    "clearly , without input from experiment , this would be a hopeless enterprise .",
    "it turns out that by colliding heavy atomic nuclei at high energies , one can create highly excited strongly interacting matter in the laboratory .",
    "the incoming kinetic energy of the colliding nuclei is largely converted into compression and thermal energy , and by varying the collision energy one is able to produce a wide range of different matter types as characterized by their baryon density , @xmath44 and temperature , @xmath45 .",
    "this is illustrated in a schematic phase diagram of strongly interacting matter in fig .",
    "[ fig_phasedia ] .    , and temperature , @xmath45 .",
    "the former determines the net baryon density in the system .",
    "the shaded bands are schematic dividers of the different phases as expected from theoretical model calculations . at vanishing @xmath46 ,",
    "current lattice qcd calculations indicate a crossover transition from hot hadronic matter to the qgp at a ( pseudo- ) critical temperature of @xmath1=160 - 190  mev  @xcite .",
    "normal nuclear matter ( as present in atomic nuclei ) is located on the @xmath45=0 axis at @xmath47  mev ( corresponding to a nucleon density of @xmath48  @xmath49 , the nuclear saturation density ) . at larger @xmath46 ( and small @xmath45@xmath50  50 - 100  mev )",
    ", one expects the formation of a color - superconductor  @xcite , i.e. , cold quark matter with a bcs - type condensate of quark cooper pairs , @xmath51 .",
    "the `` data '' points are empirical extractions of @xmath52-values from the observed production ratios of various hadron species ( @xmath53 , @xmath8 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , etc . ) in heavy - ion experiments at different beam energies  @xcite . ]    in the present article we will mainly focus on heavy - ion collisions at the highest currently available energies .",
    "these experiments are being conducted at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl , upton , new york ) : gold ( au ) nuclei , fully stripped of their electrons , are accelerated in two separate beam pipes to an energy of @xmath56  gev per nucleon , before being smashed together head on at four collision points where two large ( phenix and star ) and two smaller ( brahms and phobos ) detector systems have been positioned . with each gold nucleus consisting of @xmath57=197 nucleons ( as given by the atomic mass number of gold ) , a total ( center - of - mass ) energy of @xmath58 is brought into the collision zone . note that the energy of the accelerated nuclei exceeds their rest mass by more than a factor of 100 ( recall that the rest mass of the nucleon is @xmath59  gev/@xmath11 ) . in a central au - au collision at rhic",
    "approximately 5000 particles are produced ( as observed in the detectors ) , emanating from the collision point with velocities not far from the speed of light .",
    "most of these particles are pions , but essentially all known ( and sufficiently long - lived ) hadrons made of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 quarks are observed .",
    "the key challenge is then to infer from the debris of produced particles the formation and properties of the matter - the `` fireball '' - that was created in the immediate aftermath of the collision .",
    "while the typical lifetime of the fireball is only about @xmath60s , it is most likely long enough to form locally equilibrated strongly interacting matter which allows for a meaningful analysis of its properties in terms of thermodynamic concepts , and thus to study the qcd phase diagram as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig_phasedia ] .",
    "this has been largely deduced from the multiplicities and momentum spectra of produced hadrons , which allow to determine typical temperatures and collective expansion velocities of the exploding fireball , at least in the later ( hadronic ) phases of its evolution .",
    "a possibly formed qgp will , however , occur in the earlier ( hotter and denser ) phases of a heavy - ion reaction .",
    "the identification and assessment of suitable qgp signatures is at the very forefront of contemporary research .",
    "hadrons containing heavy quarks ( charm and bottom , @xmath61 ) have been identified as particularly promising probes of the qgp .",
    "the basic idea is as follows : since charm- and bottom - quark masses , @xmath62  gev/@xmath11 and @xmath63  gev/@xmath11 , are much larger than the typical temperatures , @xmath64 , of the medium formed in a heavy - ion collision , they are ( i ) only produced very early in the collision ( upon first impact of the colliding nuclei ) and , ( ii ) not expected to thermalize during the lifetime of the fireball .",
    "furthermore , the largest changes of their momentum spectra occur when the collision rate and momentum transfer are the highest .",
    "this is facilitated by a large density and temperature ( i.e. , in the early phases of a heavy - ion reaction ) , but is crucially dependent also on the interaction strength .",
    "both aspects are embodied into the notion of transport coefficients .",
    "the main objective of this article is to provide a theoretical description of heavy - quark transport in the qgp , and to test the results in applications to rhic data .",

    "the basic quantity which , in principle , completely determines the theory of the strong interaction , is the lagrangian of qcd , @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 denote the elementary matter fields , quarks and antiquarks .",
    "the quark fields are specified by several quantum numbers : ( i ) color charge ( red , green or blue ) , ( ii ) flavor ( up , down , strange , charm , bottom and top ) and ( iii ) spin ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the mass matrix @xmath69 is a simple diagonal matrix in flavor space .",
    "it roughly separates qcd into a light - flavor ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 with bare masses @xmath70@xmath710.005  gev/@xmath11 ) and a heavy - flavor sector ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 with @xmath72@xmath711.3  gev/@xmath11 , @xmath73@xmath714.5  gev/@xmath11 , @xmath74@xmath71175  gev/@xmath11 ) , while the strange - quark mass is somewhat in between ( @xmath75@xmath710.12  gev/@xmath11 ) .",
    "the interactions of the quarks are encoded in the covariant derivative , @xmath76 , where @xmath57 denotes the gluon field , the carrier of the strong force , and the gauge coupling @xmath77 quantifies the interaction strength as referred to in fig .",
    "[ fig_alphas ] .",
    "a pictorial representation of these interactions can be given in terms of feynman diagrams : quarks interact via the exchange of gluons , cf .",
    "[ fig_gluo - ex ] .",
    "the gluons are massless particles with spin 1 ; most notably , they also carry color charge ( which comes in 8 different charge - anticharge combinations , e.g. , red - antigreen , red - antiblue , etc . ) , giving rise to gluon self - interactions .",
    "these are encoded in the last term of eq .",

    "[ fig_gluo - ex ] ) .",
    "each interaction vertex brings in a factor of @xmath77 into the calculations of a given diagram ( except for the 4-gluon vertex which is proportional to @xmath81 ) .",
    "all diagrams ( more precisely , the pertinent scattering amplitudes ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_gluo - ex ] are thus proportional to @xmath82 , while more complicated diagrams ( involving additional quark / gluon vertices ) are of higher order in @xmath32 .",
    "this forms the basis for perturbation theory : for small @xmath32 , higher order diagrams are suppressed , ensuring a rapid convergence of the perturbation series .",
    "perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) indeed works very well for reactions at large momentum transfer , @xmath28 , where @xmath27 is small , cf .",
    "[ fig_alphas ] , while it breaks down for small @xmath28 .",
    "one possibility to obtain information on the nonperturbative interactions is to investigate the potential between two static quark charges , i.e. , the potential between a heavy quark and antiquark . in the color neutral channel",
    ", a phenomenological ansatz can be written as a combination of a coulombic attraction at short distances which merges into a linearly rising potential at large distance ( signifying confinement ) , @xmath83 where @xmath84  gev / fm denotes the `` string tension '' .",
    "such a potential provides a good description of the observed spectra of heavy quarkonium states , i.e. , charm - anticharm and bottom - antibottom quark bound states . in recent years",
    ", the heavy - quark potential has been computed with good precision in lattice qcd , which fully confirmed the phenomenological ansatz , eq .",
    "( [ vqqbar ] ) , ( see , e.g. , fig .  [ fig_hq - pot ] ) .",
    "subsequently , the potential approach , in combination with expansions organized in powers of the inverse hq mass , @xmath85 ( rather than the coupling constant ) , has been developed into an effective theory of low - energy qcd , cf .",
    "@xcite for a review .    2.12  @xmath86 ( where the conversion has been done using @xmath87  gev  fm ) .",
    "]    besides the ( external ) quark masses , qcd has only one ( intrinsic ) dimensionful scale which is generated by quantum effects ( loop corrections ) . the latter give rise to the running coupling constant , @xmath88 where @xmath89=3 is the number of color charges and @xmath90 the number of active quark flavors at given @xmath28 ( i.e. , the number of flavors with @xmath91 ) .",
    "it is tempting to interpret the value of @xmath92  gev as the dividing line between perturbative and nonperturbative regimes of qcd . in practice , however , the scale for the onset of nonperturbative effects is significantly larger , typically given by the hadronic mass scale of @xmath121  gev . to understand the emergence of this scale ,",
    "it is important to realize that the qcd vacuum structure is rather rich , characterized by quark and gluon condensates .",
    "e.g. , in the light scalar quark - antiquark channel ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) a strongly attractive force leads to the spontaneous formation and condensation of @xmath95 pairs ( reminiscent to a bose condensate ) , cf .",
    "@xcite for a review ] . an important consequence of the condensate formation is that the light quarks acquire an effective mass when propagating through the condensed vacuum , which is given by the condensate as @xmath96  gev , where @xmath97 is an ( instanton - induced ) effective quark coupling constant .",
    "note that this mass exceeds the bare quark masses by about a factor of @xmath12100 , being the major source of the proton mass , @xmath98 , and thus of the visible mass in the universe .",
    "formally , the presence of the constituent quark mass ( and quark condensate ) is closely related to the phenomenon of `` spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry '' ( sbcs ) : in the limit of vanishing bare - quark masses ( which is a good approximation for the very light @xmath14 and @xmath15 quarks ) , the qcd lagrangian is invariant under rotations in isospin and chirality ( handedness ) , i.e. , transformations that change @xmath14 into @xmath15 quarks and left - handed into right - handed quarks .",
    "this invariance is equivalent to the conservation of isospin and chiral quantum numbers of a quark .",
    "however , the constituent quark mass breaks the chiral symmetry ( i.e. , massive quarks can change their chirality so that it is no longer conserved ) .",
    "sbcs not only manifests itself in the qcd ground - state , but also in its excitation spectrum , i.e. , hadrons .",
    "therefore , hadronic states which transform into each other under `` chiral rotations '' ( so - called chiral multiplets or partners ) are split in mass due to sbcs .",
    "prominent examples in the meson spectrum are @xmath53(140)-@xmath6(400 - 1200 ) and @xmath99(770)-@xmath100(1260 ) , or @xmath101(940)-@xmath102(1535 ) in the nucleon spectrum .    in the following section , we will discuss how the presence of strongly interacting matter affects the nonperturbative structure of the qcd vacuum and the interactions therein .      when heating a condensed state , the general expectation is that the condensate eventually `` melts '' ( or `` evaporates '' ) , and that the interactions are screened due to the presence of charged particles in the medium .",
    "transferring this expectation to the qcd vacuum implies that , at sufficiently large temperature , the condensates should vanish and the quarks and gluons are released from their hadronic bound states ( deconfinement ) , forming the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "numerical lattice qcd ( lqcd ) computations of the thermodynamic partition function at finite temperature have substantially quantified this notion over the last two decades or so .",

    "[ fig_op - lqcd ] .",
    "the latter is , roughly speaking , proportional to the exponent of the heavy - quark free energy at large distance , @xmath116 , which vanishes in the confined phase ( or at least becomes very small since @xmath117 is large ) , but is finite in the deconfined qgp .",

    "however , the implications of these in - medium modifications for the binding of quarkonium states are quite subtle .",
    "the first problem is that , unlike in the vacuum case , the identification of the free energy with an interaction potential is no longer straightforward , due to the appearance of an entropy term , @xmath120 , @xmath121 where @xmath122 denotes the internal energy .",
    "it is currently an open problem whether @xmath123  @xcite or @xmath124  @xcite ( or even a combination thereof  @xcite ) is the most suitable quantity to be inserted into a potential model calculation for quarkonium states in the medium ( typically carried out using a schrdinger equation ) .",
    "the different choices lead to considerably different results for the quarkonium binding in the qgp . on the one hand , when directly using the free energy @xmath123 , the charmonium ground state ( the @xmath125-wave @xmath126 or @xmath127 states ) dissolves not far above the critical temperature , at about 1.2  @xmath1  @xcite .",

    "do they suffer jet quenching at high @xmath138 ?",
    "do they corroborate evidence for quark coalescence processes ?",
    "initial measurements of heavy - quark observables have been performed providing tantalizing evidence that the answer to these questions may indeed be largely positive : a substantial elliptic flow and suppression of single - electron spectra associated with semileptonic heavy - meson decays has been observed , i.e. , electrons ( and positrons ) arising via decays of the type @xmath178 and @xmath179 ( the heavy - light mesons , @xmath180 and @xmath181 , are composed of a heavy quark ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) and a light antiquark ( @xmath182 ) , and as such are the main carriers of heavy quarks in the system ) .",

    "this has several implications :    * the production of heavy quarks is essentially constrained to the early , primordial stages of a heavy - ion collision .",

    "* as is well - known from electrodynamics , bremsstrahlung off an accelerated ( or decelerated ) charged particle is suppressed by a large power of its the mass , @xmath187 for heavy relative to light quarks .",
    "therefore , induced gluon radiation off heavy quarks ( i.e. , radiative energy loss ) is much suppressed relative to elastic scattering .",
    "* the typical momentum transfer from a thermal medium to a heavy quark is small compared to the hq momentum , @xmath188 ( where @xmath189 is the thermal momentum of a heavy quark in nonrelativistic approximation , @xmath190 ; for a relativistically moving quark , it is parametrically even larger , @xmath191 ) .",
    "this renders a brownian motion approach ( fokker - planck equation ) a suitable and controlled theoretical framework for describing the diffusion of a heavy quark in the ( s)qgp . *",
    "the hq mass can furthermore be utilized as a large scale in developing effective ( nonperturbative ) interactions , such as hq effective theory or potential model approaches . in principle , this allows to make contact with static interaction potentials from finite - temperature lattice qcd , although a number of issues have to be resolved before reliable quantitative predictions can be made .",
    "* at low momenta , nonperturbative ( resummation ) effects become relatively more important with increasing mass .",

    "it is gratifying to see that the available electron data thus far confirm the strongly coupled nature of the qgp produced at rhic ; relativistic langevin simulations have quantified this notion in terms of extracted transport coefficients which are a factor of 3 - 5 stronger than expectations based on elastic perturbative qcd interactions . at least in the low - momentum regime , this should be a reliable statement since the heavy - quark mass warrants the main underlying assumptions , namely : ( i ) the applicability of the brownian motion approach , and ( ii ) the dominance of elastic interactions . clearly , an important next step is to augment these calculations by a controlled implementation of radiative energy - loss mechanisms , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a first estimate . as for the microscopic understanding of the relevant interactions underlying the hq rescattering",
    ", it should be noted that large couplings necessarily require resummations of some sort , especially for the problem at hand , i.e. , hq diffusion , for which the perturbation series converges especially poorly  @xcite .",
    "an example of such a ( partial ) resummation is given by the @xmath45-matrix approach  @xcite discussed above , which is particularly valuable when it can be combined with model - independent input from lattice qcd . here",
    "the objective must be to reduce the uncertainties in the definition and extraction of a suitable potential .",
    "this task can be facilitated by computing `` euclidean '' ( imaginary time ) correlation functions for heavy - light mesons and check them against direct lattice computations which can be carried out with good accuracy .",
    "these kinds of constraints are currently pursued in the heavy quarkonium sector  @xcite , i.e. , for @xmath28-@xmath118 correlation functions , indicating that potential models are a viable framework to describe in - medium hq interactions .",
    "an alternative nonperturbative approach to describe the medium of a strongly - coupled gauge theory has recently been put forward by exploiting connections between string theory and conformal field theory ( cft ) , the so - called ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the key point here is a conjectured duality between the weak - coupling limit of a certain string theory ( defined in anti - de - sitter ( ads ) space ) and the strong - coupling limit of a supersymmetric gauge theory ( `` conformal '' indicates that the theory does not carry any intrinsic scale , such as @xmath445 in qcd ; this difference may , in fact , be the weakest link in the identification of the cft plasma with the qgp ; it implies , e.g. , the absence of a critical temperature in cft ) .",
    "a remarkable result of such a correspondence is the derivation of a universal value for the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density pertaining to a large class of strongly coupled quantum field theories , @xmath446 , which was furthermore conjectured to be an absolute lower bound for any quantum liquid  @xcite . within the same framework ,",
    "the hq diffusion has been computed , with the result @xmath447  @xcite .",
    "the assumption that the qgp is indeed in a strongly coupled regime ( sqgp ) can then be utilized to establish a relation between @xmath448 and the heavy - quark diffusion constant , and thus obtain a quantitative estimate of @xmath448 . based on ads",

    "it turns out that the occurrence of a maximal interaction strength at a phase transition is a rather generic phenomenon which is present in a large variety of substances : at their critical pressure , helium , nitrogen and even water have a very pronounced minimum in @xmath448 at the critical temperature , as is nicely demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite and compiled in fig .  [ fig_etas - comp ] taken from ref .",
    "this plot also contains calculations for @xmath448 in the hadronic phase , using free @xmath53-@xmath53 interactions in a pion gas  @xcite ( similar results are obtained for a @xmath53-@xmath54 gas with empirical ( vacuum ) scattering phase shifts  @xcite ) .",
    "the decrease of @xmath448 in a hot meson gas with increasing @xmath45 corroborates the presence of a minimum around the critical temperature .",
    "the finite - temperature qcd phase transition at @xmath465=0 is presumably a cross - over , but the minimum structure of @xmath448 close to @xmath1 is likely to persist , in analogy to the atomic and molecular system above the critical pressure  @xcite .",
    "if such a minimum is indeed intimately linked to the critical temperature , the ads / cft correspondence may be of limited applicability to establish rigorous connections between the sqgp ( and rhic phenomenology ) and cfts , since , as mentioned above , the latter do not possess an intrinsic scale .",
    "the question of how a gluon plasma ( gp ) compares to a quark - gluon plasma is not merely a theoretical one , but also of practical relevance . in heavy - ion collisions at collider energies ( rhic and lhc ) ,",
    "the ( very ) early phases of the reaction are presumably dominated by the ( virtual ) gluon fields in the incoming nuclei .",
    "a lot of progress has been made in recent years in the determination of these gluon distributions and their early evolution in urhics  @xcite .",
    "the modifications of the hq spectra due to these strong `` color '' fields should certainly be addressed in future work . in the subsequent evolution ,",
    "an early formed gp is estimated to chemically equilibrate into a qgp rather rapidly , and closer to @xmath1 quark coalescence models are suggestive for the dominance of quark degrees of freedom - this is where the @xmath45-matrix approach with lqcd - based potentials is predominantly operative ( recall that it hinges on the presence of quarks and antiquarks in the medium ) .",
    "the underlying interactions could therefore provide a unified and quantitative framework for hq diffusion , quark coalescence and the sqgp in the vicinity of @xmath1 , based on input which , in principle , is directly extracted from lqcd .",
    "its further development should aim at a better determination of potentials extracted from lqcd , include constraints from lattice correlation functions and applications to quarkonia , and implement contributions due to gluon radiation processes .",
    "the study of elementary particle matter has been an extremely active research field over the last 20 - 30 years , and it may not have reached its peak time yet .",
    "we are beginning to understand better what the key features of media are whose forces are directly governed by gauge theories . here the strong nuclear force between quarks and gluons ( as described by quantum chromodynamics ) occupies a special role due to its large interaction strength and the self - couplings of its field quanta .",
    "on the one hand , qcd gives rise to novel nonperturbative phenomena in the vacuum , most notably the confinement of quarks into hadrons and the chiral symmetry breaking ( generating the major part of the visible mass in the universe ) , whose underlying mechanisms are , however , not yet understood .",
    "on the other hand , the strong force generates a very rich phase structure of its different matter states ( upon varying temperature and baryon density ) , which are even less understood .",
    "pertinent phase transitions are , in fact , closely connected with deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "first principle numerical calculations of discretized ( lattice ) qcd at finite temperature have clearly established a transition ( or a rapid cross over ) from hadronic matter into a deconfined quark - gluon plasma with restored chiral symmetry at a temperature of @xmath466  gev .",
    "this state of matter is believed to have prevailed in the early universe in the first few microseconds after the big bang .",
    "a particularly exciting aspect of this research field is that such kind of matter can be reproduced , at least for a short moment , in present - day laboratory experiments , by accelerating and colliding heavy atomic nuclei .",
    "however , to analyze these reactions , and to extract possible evidence for qgp formation out of the debris of hundreds to thousands of produced hadrons , is a formidable task that requires a broad approach , combining information from lattice qcd , effective models of qcd in a well - defined applicability range , and their implementation into heavy - ion phenomenology .",
    "large progress has been made at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) , where clear evidence for the formation of thermalized qcd matter well above the critical energy density has been deduced .",
    "the apparently small viscosity of the medium is inconsistent with a weakly interacting gas of quarks and gluons , but is possibly related to recent results from lattice qcd which suggest the presence of resonant correlations for temperatures up to @xmath122  @xmath1 .",
    "we have argued that heavy quarks can serve as controlled probe of the transport properties of the strongly coupled qgp ( sqgp ) .",
    "the modifications of heavy - quark spectra in au - au collisions at rhic can be evaluated in a brownian motion framework which allows to establish quantitative connections between the heavy - quark diffusion coefficients and observables , such as the suppression of their spectra and especially their elliptic flow .",
    "theoretical analyses have confirmed that perturbative interactions are too weak to account for the measured heavy - quark observables ( i.e. , their electron decay spectra ) , while an effective resonance model seems to furnish the required nonperturbative interaction strength .",
    "an appealing framework to calculate heavy - quark interactions ( and transport properties ) in the medium is to extract interaction potentials from lattice qcd and iterate them in a nonperturbative @xmath45-matrix equation .",
    "this approach is , in principle , free of adjustable parameters , but currently subject to significant uncertainties , primarily in the definition of the potentials and their applicability to light quarks and at high momentum .",
    "however , promising results have been obtained in that the @xmath45-matrix builds up resonance - like structures close to the phase transition , which could be instrumental in explaining the observed elliptic flow .",
    "in addition , the resonance correlations naturally explain the importance of quark coalescence processes for the hadronization of the qgp ( as indicated by the measured light hadron spectra ) .",
    "clearly , a lot more work is required to elaborate these connections more rigorously and quantitatively , to implement additional components toward a more complete description ( e.g. , energy loss via gluon radiation or the effects of strong color fields ) , to scrutinize the results in comparison to improved lattice qcd computations , and to confront calculations with high precision rhic ( and lhc ) data .",
    "the latter are expected to emerge in the coming years and will surely hold new surprises , further pushing the frontier of our knowledge of the quark - gluon plasma .    * acknowledgment * + we are indebted to our colleagues vincenzo greco , che - ming ko and massimo mannarelli for many fruitful discussions and collaboration , and thank william zajc for a careful reading of the manuscript .",
