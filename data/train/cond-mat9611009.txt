    "these two are part of the set @xmath91 of mutually dependent quantities .",
    "we will now argue what is the exponent of their scaling behavior and therefore of @xmath70 , without trying to obtain the precise prefactor ( which would be quite tedious ) .",

    "we neglect the @xmath98 and @xmath99 terms in the summations .",

    "a direct consequence of this is that @xmath113 .",
    "if the size dependence of the parameters is neglected [ @xmath114 _ inside _ the summations ( [ eq : sumkappa])-([eq : sum1 ] ) ] , we also find the prefactor : @xmath115 .",
    "\\label{eq : tscalesimple}\\ ] ] upto @xmath116 this is in good agreement with the numerical solution of ( [ eq : sumkappa])-([eq : sum1 ] ) for various sizes @xmath74 .",

    "we will neglect these .",
    "neuberger and ziman @xcite state a lemma applicable to this summation .",
    "this leads to : @xmath120 for @xmath118 we find in a similar fashion : @xmath121 these formulas are in excellent agreement with the numerical solution to ( [ eq : sumkappa])-([eq : sum1 ] ) . for @xmath118",
    "this is depicted in figure [ fig : jyscale ] .    in conclusion , we have obtained the scaling behavior of @xmath70 and @xmath71 from an analysis of the formulas in the sbmfa for the frustrated heisenberg antiferromagnet . the qualitative scaling behavior ( i.e. the exponents ) is the same as for the _ unfrustrated _ case , which was discussed by neuberger and ziman @xcite .",
    "the scaling behavior that was utilized by einarsson and schulz @xcite does agree with our findings but we confirm the message of feiguin et al.@xcite that the clusters they used are too small for the scaling behavior of @xmath71 to have set in .",
    "numerically we see that the scaling behavior starts around size @xmath122 ( see figure [ fig : jyscale ] ) whereas the largest cluster they used is @xmath123 .",
