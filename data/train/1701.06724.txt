    "it is well known that along the evolution of our universe are involved a great number of dissipative processes , however , there is not a definitive model to describe the overall dynamics of this dissipation since some explanations are based on speculative physics @xcite . in the search for a coherent model ,",
    "was found that these dissipative processes can be well treated by employing a relativistic theory of bulk viscosity .",
    "qualitatively , the bulk viscosity can be interpreted as a macroscopic consequence coming from the frictional effects in mixtures .",
    "the dark sector of the universe is the main material sector and is the one that presents more open questions about its real nature , in terms of what we know from our current theories . in this sense ,",
    "one of the possible reasonable assumptions is to consider unified dark matter models , where the dark matter exhibits dissipative effects , which can lead the accelerated expansion that is associated to the dark energy component . for an inhomogeneous and isotropic universe",
    "only the bulk viscosity is present , and in general it is assumed that is ruled by a simple suitable expression in terms of the energy density of the dark fluid . a causal and stable theory of thermal phenomena in the presence of gravitational fields ,",
    "was introduced by israel and stewart ( is ) @xcite , it provided a better description than eckart and landau and lifshitz theories , but sharing with them the characteristic that only small deviations from equilibrium are assumed , then the transport equation is linear in the bulk viscous pressure ; despite the improvements in the thermal description obtained with the is theory , it was found in ref",
    ". @xcite that for an inflating universe driven by viscosity it was necessary to consider a non - linear extension of the theory .",
    "this extension was done in @xcite , and the major aim of this work was to study inflationary solutions with no need of scalar fields , this new theory includes the is theory in the linear regime ensuring the causality and stability , obeys the second law of thermodynamics , i.e. , the positivity of the entropy production is ensured ( see for instance the ref .",
    "@xcite with a discussion in this topic for the horava - lifshitz gravity in the holographic context ) and naturally imposes an upper limit for the bulk viscous stress . + additionally to the cosmological constant , the expansion of the universe can be driven by scalar fields and the appropriate election of a potential function for the scalar field .",
    "some of these scalar fields are candidates for dark energy ( de ) , such as quintessence and tachyonic fields , however , for these models the parameter @xmath2 of the equation state ( eos ) @xmath3 is restricted to @xmath4 .",
    "nevertheless , more than a decade ago was pointed out in @xcite that @xmath5 is also compatible with most classical tests of cosmology , including the type 1a sne data as well as the cosmic microwave background anisotropy and mass power spectrum .",
    "more recent observations do not ruled out this possibility @xcite . in order to explore this new region",
    "it was neccesary the introduction of a new component given by a scalar field called _ phantom _ with `` wrong '' sign in its kinetic term , @xmath6 , such that @xmath7 .",
    "this scenario is not consistent with the dominant energy component ( dec ) , so an increasing energy density for the fluid filling the universe occurs as the cosmic time evolves .",
    "these phantom fields have the drawback of experimenting vacuum instability @xcite , so further investigations have been devoted to cross this phantom divide without instabilities . in the case of general k - essence models for a single scalar field which is described by an action with interaction with other energy components throughout kinetic couplings and higher derivatives , can cross the phantom divide without gradient instabilities , singularities or ghosts .",
    "another possibility , as suggested in @xcite , corresponds to the treatment of the scalar field as a velocity potential of an imperfect fluid , when the expansion around a perfect fluid is considered , the identification of some terms which correct the pressure in the manner of bulk viscosity can be performed .",
    "+ in the case of imperfect fluids in the framework of general relativity it is well known that the existence of dissipation in the cosmic components is a mechanism that allows violation of dec condition @xcite .",
    "then , it is natural to explore the existence of phantom solutions in the causal thermodynamics approach of the is theory . in this framework",
    "a phantom solution was recently found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this solution",
    "the universe is filled with a single fluid with positive pressure and the viscosity drives the effective eos to be of phantom type .",
    "so this solution can be interpreted as an indication of the possibility to cross the phantom divide via a dissipative mechanism . nevertheless , a phantom solution do not satisfy the near equilibrium condition , given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the viscous pressure and @xmath10 the energy density of the fluid .",

    "( [ pieqa ] ) implies that the viscous stress is greater than the equilibrium pressure @xmath13 .",
    "the is approach is valid in the near equilibrium regime , so , in order to include the phantom case it is necessary to consider a non - linear generalization of the causal linear thermodynamics of bulk viscosity where deviations from equilibrium are allowed . in this non - linear approach",
    "accelerated stable expansion has been reported for non - interacting two - fluid models where some of them presents viscosity @xcite . in this work we focus on a non - linear extension of the is formalism to explore the possibility of a phantom solution , and how it can be characterized in terms of the parameters associated to the dissipative fluid involved .",
    "+ the organisation of this article is as follows : in section ii , by considering the non - linear extension of the is theory made by maartens and mndez @xcite , we explore the existence of a phantom solution for the dynamical equation of the non - linear bulk viscosity .",
    "this is done by using the following ansatz @xmath14 which leads to a phantom solution for a late time flrw flat universe filled with only one barotropic fluid with bulk viscosity , where @xmath15 is a constant and @xmath16 a finite time in the future @xcite . in section iii",
    "we consider some thermodynamical implications of the phantom solution .",
