    "there has been a recent flurry of discoveries of stars within the local solar neighbourhood .",
    "some have been discovered as companions to well  known nearby stars ( eg .  @xmath4 indi b / c ; see @xcite and references therein ) while others are entirely new systems ( eg .",
    "the recons group ( research consortium on nearby stars ) has sought to identify and study all systems within 10pc of the sun .",
    "previous papers of this series have used a variety of photometric and spectroscopic techniques to identify and study samples of nearby stars and describe discovery of companions to known nearby stars and identification of entirely new systems .",
    "most recently , a new initiative @xcite identified five nearby high proper motion stars , two of which have initial photometric parallaxes within the recons horizon .",
    "the nearest of these , scr18456357 , ( hereafter the target ) was shown subsequently to have a photometric parallax of @xmath0  pc @xcite .",
    "photometric data for the target are reproduced in table  [ phot ] .",
    "these show that the object is very red ; @xcite classified the target as an m8.5 dwarf .",
    "luckily there is a wealth of astrometric data available for this object , partly because it lies in the overlap region between the standard schmidt photographic survey fields , and partly because non  survey programmes have fortuitously observed the field containing the target frequently and over a long time baseline .",
    "the target was identified on two united kingdom schmidt telescope ( ukst ) r survey plates and one european southern observatory ( eso ) survey r plate .",
    "these had already been scanned as part of the supercosmos sky survey ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition six ukst non - survey r photographs from the ukst plate library were selected for their image quality and useful parallax factors , and were scanned especially for this study using supercosmos .",
    "hence a total of nine schmidt photographs were used , details of these are shown in table  [ plates ] .",
    "these also provide a nine year baseline , ideal for measuring an accurate proper motion . +    .photometric data on scr18456357 .",
    "jhk magnitudes are taken from the two micron all sky survey , v , r and i measurements are from henry et al .",
    "note that the b@xmath5 measurement comes from a plate where the target image is deblended and hence may not be as accurate as the other measurements .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]         as a test of the astrometry , each reference star was also run through the same astrometric model fitting procedure and the proper motions and parallaxes of the reference stars were found .",
    "these are plotted in figure  [ paraplot ] along with the target .",
    "it is clear that the target is well separated from the mass of reference stars . in general the reference stars",
    "have proper motions and parallaxes consistent with zero ( and a mean value of @xmath60.72 indicating good model fits ) and hence are good reference stars . to further investigate the reference star distances , and for the purposes of correcting the measured ( ie .",
    "relative ) parallax to an absolute parallax , the mean b@xmath5r@xmath7 and  r@xmath7 for the reference stars were found .",
    "the mean b@xmath5r@xmath7 calculation was then used to find that the mean spectral type ( assuming they are dwarfs ) for the reference stars is g5  @xcite . from this",
    "the mean expected absolute r@xmath7 magnitude  @xcite can be deduced which combined with the mean r@xmath7 magnitude yields the mean expected distance of the reference stars .",
    "the mean expected trigonometric parallax of the reference stars was thus found to be @xmath8  mas .",
    "this is clearly insignificant compared to the formal error on our parallax for the target , so we made no correction from relative to absolute parallax .",
    "to further test that the method used was sound , 100 sets of simulated data were created .",
    "each had the same astrometric parameters as the target and each data point was given a random gaussian error calculated from the rms error estimates of the particular plate .",
    "these were then run through the astrometric solution fitting program .",
    "no significant offsets were found and the error on the parallax calculated from the scatter of the simulated data solutions was in good agreement to that predicted by the astrometric solution .    finally , we examined differential colour refraction ( dcr ) effects between the reference stars and the target . in figure  [ dcr1845 ]",
    "we show model predictions for the coefficient of refraction , r , for stars of various synthetic photographic colour .",
    "we used methods described in @xcite and references therein ; we additionally used the flux calibrated spectrum of scr18456357 presented in henry et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to compute  r@xmath7 and synthetic ( r@xmath7i@xmath9 ) for the extremely red target .",
    "the reference stars are taken as an ensemble of points that typically have ( r@xmath7i@xmath9 )  @xmath10 , whereas the target has ( r@xmath7i@xmath9)=3.6 computed from the spectrum , and 3.75 from the photographic photometry listed in table  [ phot ] ( these colours are consistent within the photographic photometric errors of @xmath11 for r@xmath7i@xmath9 ) .",
    "these colours indicate a difference in refraction coefficient of @xmath12 r @xmath13  mas at airmass of 1.5 ( figure  [ dcr1845 ] ) .",
    "this difference changes negligibly with airmass , i.e. recomputations at 1.0 and 2.0 airmasses show a zero point shift in the locus of figure  [ dcr1845 ] , but no significant change in the delta r value for the two colors .",
    "however the quantity of most relevance is of course how this differential refraction coefficient translates into image displacement at the different hour angles and zenith distances of the observations in table  [ plates ] .",
    "typically , the dcr shift for ra is @xmath14  mas and for dec is @xmath15  mas ; the largest change between any two observations is 10  mas for ra and 3  mas for dec because all of the plates used are within 2 hours of the meridian , so dcr is minimal .",
    "hence , we feel justified in neglecting these corrections in our astrometric model since the positional uncertainties dominate systematic effects due to dcr .",
    "the calculated trigonomteric parallax for the target gives a distance of @xmath2  pc .",
    "consulting the recons list of nearby stars we find that this makes scr18456357 the 16th nearest stellar system to the sun .",
    "the upper and lower one sigma error boundaries would make it the 23rd and 10th nearest stellar system respectively .",
    "we note that the recons photometric parallax is @xmath0  pc  @xcite hence our new trigonometric parallax puts this object @xmath16 nearer than was first estimated .",
    "@xcite estimated the distance to be @xmath17  pc ; we expect the true distance of the target to be between the estimate given here and that of @xcite .",
    "we have measured the trigonometric parallax of scr18456357 and found it to be the 16th nearest stellar system to the sun .",
    "this demonstrates that the wealth of astrometric information on the many plates taken over the past 50 years can yield new insight into the nearby star population and , in particular , permit the determination of valuable trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "the authors would like to thank sue tritton and mike read for their help in selecting plates and harvey macgillivray and eve thomson for their prompt scanning of the material on supercosmos .",
    "supercosmos is funded by a grant from the uk particle physics and astronomy research council .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",
