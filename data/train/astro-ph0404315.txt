    "the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) was extremely successful in characterizing for the first time the global properties of the mid- and far - infrared sky , carrying out an all - sky survey at wavelengths of 12 , 25 , 60 and 100 @xmath0 m and leading to discoveries such as those of luminous , ultraluminous and hyperluminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs , ulirg and hlirgs , respectively ) , a substantial population of evolving starbursts and the detection of large - scale structure in the galaxy distribution @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the iras view was typically limited to the very local universe ( @xmath2 ) , thus hampering statistical studies of infrared - luminous galaxies at cosmological redshifts .",
    "only few sources were detected by iras at higher redshifts , typically ulirgs magnified by gravitational lenses , like f10214 + 4724 ( @xmath3 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in particular only about 1000 galaxies were detected all over the sky in iras 12 band .",
    "infrared source counts based on iras data @xcite showed some marginally significant excess of faint sources with respect to no evolution models @xcite , but not enough statistics and dynamic range in flux to discriminate between evolutionary scenarios were available .    although conceived as an observatory - type mission , the infrared space observatory ( iso , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was in many ways the natural successor to iras , bringing a gain of a factor @xmath4 in sensitivity and @xmath5 in angular resolution in the mid - infrared . a substantial amount of iso observing time was therefore devoted to field surveys aimed at detecting faint infrared galaxies down to cosmological distances .",
    "such surveys were conceived as complementary in flux depth and areal coverage , allowing a systematic investigation of the extragalactic sky down to so far unattainable flux densities at both mid and far infrared wavelengths , whose results are summarized by @xcite .",
    "in particular , extragalactic 15 source counts determined with isocam @xcite have revealed a significant departure from euclidean slope within the 1 - 5 mjy flux range , which has been interpreted as evidence for a strongly evolving population of starburst galaxies .",
    "the european large area iso survey ( elais , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was the most ambitious non - serendipitous survey and the largest open time project carried out with iso , aimed at bridging the flux gap between iras all - sky survey and iso deeper surveys .",
    "elais observations mapped areas of about 12 at 15 and 90 @xmath0 m and smaller areas at 7 and 175 @xmath0 m with the isocam ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and 15 @xmath0 m ) and isophot ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and 175 @xmath0 m ) cameras .",
    "most importantly , elais 15 @xmath0 m observations are the only ones allowing to sample the 1 - 5 mjy flux range , where most of the source evolution appears to take place .    since the project approval ,",
    "the elais consortium , grown in time to a total of 76 collaborators from 30 european institutes , has undertaken an extensive program of ground - based optical and near - infrared imaging and spectroscopy .",
    "thanks to such an extensive multi - wavelength coverage , the elais fields have now become among the best studied sky areas of their size , and natural targets of on - going or planned large - area surveys with the most powerful ground- and space - based facilities .",
    "further details on elais multi - wavelength observations and catalogues are presented in @xcite . after the loss of the wire satellite , notwithstanding the observations at several infrared wavelengths soon to come from spitzer and later from sofia and herschel",
    ", iso observations will remain a valuable database for many years to come .",
    "in particular , until the advent of jwst , elais 15 observations will provide a complementary view on three areas ( s1 , n1 and n2 ) which will be covered at different wavelengths as part of the spitzer wide - area extragalactic survey ( swire , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus the need of reducing such data with the uttermost care and provide the community with an agreed - upon legacy from the elais project .",
    "this paper presents the final analysis of elais 15 observations , and is structured as follows . in section  [ elais15.sec ] a brief description of the most relevant aspects of elais 15 @xmath0 m dataset is given .",
    "section  [ datared.sec ] describes the data reduction method and its improvements . in section  [ autosim.sec ]",
    "the technique employed for flux determination and its results are presented .",
    "section  [ simulations.sec ] details the results of the simulations that were carried out in order to assess the performance of the data reduction method and thus the quality of the resulting catalogue . in sections",
    "[ astroacc.sec ] and [ photoacc.sec ] , respectively , estimates of the achieved astrometric and photometric accuracy are given .",
    "section  [ optids.sec ] summarizes the identification of 15 @xmath0 m sources in optical and near - infrared images , while section  [ photocal.sec ] describes the procedure adopted to establish the catalogue photometric calibration .",
    "finally , section  [ catalogue.sec ] describes gives a basic description of the catalogue contents .",
    "the elais 15 @xmath0 m main dataset is made up of 28 rasters ( iso basic imaging observations ) , each covering an area of about @xmath6 , divided into 4 fields , one ( s1 ) in the southern hemisphere and three ( n1 , n2 and n3 ) in the northern one .",
    "small superpositions at the boundaries and a limited degree of redundancy on portions of the fields give a total covered area of 10.85 .",
    "the fields were selected on the basis of their high ecliptic latitude ( @xmath7 , to reduce the impact of zodiacal dust emission ) , low cirrus emission ( @xmath8 ) and absence of any bright ( @xmath9 jy ) iras 12 @xmath0 m source . in figure  [ fields.fig ] the location on the sky of the survey fields is shown , overlaid on cirrus maps ( cobe normalized iras maps of @xcite ) .",
    "nearby iras sources with 12 @xmath0 m fluxes brighter than are also plotted . the overall sky coverage , highlighting the position and redundancy of single rasters , is illustrated in figure  [ coverage.fig ] .     +     +    elais 15 @xmath0 m observations were carried out operating the isocam instrument in raster mode using the lw3 filter . in this observing mode ,",
    "the isocam @xmath10 pixel lw detector was stepped across the sky in a grid pattern , with about half detector width steps in one direction and the whole detector width steps in the other .",
    "thus , reliability was improved as each sky position ( apart from those at the boundaries of the raster region ) was observed twice in successive pointings and overheads were reduced because each raster covered a large area ( @xmath11 ) . at each raster pointing ( i.e. grid position ) the detector was read out several ( typically 10 ) times , to increase the redundancy in order to be able to identify cosmic rays impacts and distinguish their severe effects on the electronics from real sources .",
    "furthermore , on the raster first pointing , 80 readouts were carried out to allow the detector to approach stabilization .",
    "table  [ lw3pars.tab ] describes the observation parameters for the lw3 observations , while table  [ 15mumfields.tab ] lists the fields and related iso data archive filenames making up the dataset .",

    "reduction of data obtained with iso instrumentation has always proved very difficult for a number of reasons . as far as isocam observations carried out using its long wavelength ( lw ) detector are concerned , the two most important instrumental phenomena one has to deal with are the qualitatively very different effects produced on the detector s electronics by the frequent and severe cosmic ray impacts , which have long been known and referred to as * glitches * , and its sizable transient behaviour after changes in the incident photon flux , which we will hereafter simply refer to as * transients*. in both cases , the cryogenic operational temperatures of the detector caused it to very slowly respond after these events .",
    "lack of an accurate modeling of these effects can thus lead to spurious detections or errors in flux determination . in elais 15 @xmath0 m data reduction",
    ", the impact of these effects is increased by the instrumental parameters which were chosen in order to maximize the survey area . the short integration time ( @xmath17 ) , the large raster step ( half the detector size along one axis and the whole detector size along the other one ) and the large pixel size ( 6 arcsec ) all contribute to reduce the redundancy and to increase the undersampling",
    ". low redundancy and high undersampling , in turn , increase difficulties in distinguishing sources from strong glitches ( low reliability ) and in correctly determining source fluxes ( low photometric accuracy ) .",
    "roughly speaking , glitches can be divided into three categories according to the way they shape the detector s output signal , their decay time and influence on the pixel responsivity : glitches belonging to these different classes are respectively dubbed * common glitches * , * faders * and * dippers*. slow decreases of the signal following cosmic ray impacts are called faders , while prominent reductions of the pixel responsivity very slowly recovering afterwards are called dippers .",
    "these two effects are believed to be associated with proton or @xmath18 particle impacts on the detector , and have a fairly long lasting impact on pixel responsivities .",
    "conversely , the much more frequent impacts of cosmic ray electrons produce common glitches characterized by a relatively fast decay time , lasting only a few readouts .",
    "therefore , the number of frames affected by a single fader or dipper is much higher than in the case of a common glitch , the pixel responsivity taking from tens to hundreds of seconds to recover completely .",
    "however , common glitches are much more frequent than faders and dippers and , may all the same hamper the quality of data reduction .",
    "thus , all kinds of glitches , if not correctly removed ( or , more properly , corrected for ) , can lead to spurious detections , or * unreliability * , and to the loss of genuine sources , or *",
    "incompleteness*. on the other hand , transients all follow the same pattern , due to the fact that they arise from the non negligible time it takes for the output signal to reach the stabilization value after a change in the incident photon flux has taken place . the measured signal is thus always lower than the true one .",
    "failing to model this time effect in data reduction can lead to a systematic underestimation of source fluxes .",
    "for these reasons , the data cleaning and modeling is an extremely delicate process requiring great care in order to produce highly reliable sky maps and source lists .    while it was variously demonstrated that it is possible , at least to a certain extent , to describe the detector s behaviour adopting some physical model , the large number of readouts involved in raster observations and the peculiar nature and strength of noise patterns also require efficient and robust algorithms to be developed so as to make the actual data reduction undertaking feasible in a nearly - automatic way .",
    "a number of data reduction methods has thus been developed and tested , mostly on deep fields ( e.g. the preti method by @xcite and the triple beam switch method by @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , such methods did not prove completely reliable on shallower fields , leading to a high number of false detections .",
    "besides , these methods suffered from the lack of an efficient way to interactively check the quality of the data reduction when needed .",
    "the preliminary analysis of elais 15 @xmath0 m data @xcite was thus carried out adopting a more traditional approach involving the corroboration of automated detections through visual inspection by different observers .",
    "the data reduction described in this paper was carried out using the lari method @xcite , a new technique developed to overcome these difficulties and provide a robust interactive technique for the reduction and analysis of isocam and isophot data , particularly suited for the detection of faint sources and thus for the full exploitation of their scientific potential .",
    "the method was variously refined , and significantly better results are now obtained , with respect to the technique used in @xcite for the reduction of the s1 field , so that a thorough re - reduction of all elais fields seemed appropriate and was thus carried out . as before , data reduction is carried out within an idl environment using mostly purpose - built routines , exploiting cam interactive analysis ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cia , ) software for basic operations only .",
    "the lari method describes the sequence of readouts , or time history , of each pixel of isocam lw3 detector in terms of a mathematical model for the charge release towards the contacts .",
    "such a model is based on the assumption of the existence , in each pixel , of two charge reservoirs , a short - lived one @xmath19 , also known as * breve * , and a long - lived one @xmath20 , also known as * lunga * , evolving independently with a different time constant and fed by both the photon flux and the cosmic rays .",
    "the model is fully charge - conservative , i.e. no decay of accumulated charges is considered , except towards the contacts , and thus the observed signal @xmath21 is related to the incident photon flux @xmath22 and to the accumulated charges @xmath19 and @xmath20 by the @xmath23 where the evolution of these two quantities is governed by the same differential equation , albeit with a different efficiency @xmath24 and time constant @xmath25 @xmath26 so that @xmath27 the values of the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 depend on the detector s physics , and are thus assumed to depend on the exposure time of a given observation and on the stabilization background level of a given pixel , according to the relation @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the value of @xmath25 relative to a reference exposure time @xmath30 and average signal level @xmath31 . in practice , an additive offset signal attributable to thermal dark current ( a component which is otherwise removed in standard dark current subtraction ) , is actually added to both @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the equation above when it is estimated to be important , i.e. in the rare cases when the deepest dippers depth otherwise exceeds 10% of the stabilization background level .",
    "data reduction begins with a preliminary * pipeline * incorporating all necessary steps in order to prepare the data for the temporal fitting procedure which is the critical step of the lari method .",
    "raw data downloaded from the iso data archive are first imported into the idl ` raster ` structure containing all observational information using cia routines .",
    "likewise , dark current subtraction and conversion from adu to adu / gain / s are carried out using cia .",
    "then a dedicated idl structure called ` liscio ` is built in order to contain not only all ` raster ` information but also all ancillary arrays needed in order to carry out the following reduction .    at this stage",
    "potential glitches are identified through a two - step median filtering process of each pixel time history , or * deglitching*. then a separate routine determined the stabilization background ( or global background , as opposed to the local background described below ) and the aforementioned offset signal .",
    "such routine was carefully devised to filter out in so far as possible long - term effects such as stabilization , faders and dippers and thus provide a reliable estimate of these two parameters the fitting procedure is particularly sensitive to .",
    "the same routine also identifies the few potential bright sources which at times the fit failed to recognize by itself , which are then interactively checked by eye to assess their reliability .",
    "the signal as a function of time is finally processed independently for each pixel .",
    "the fitting procedure models the transients attributable to changes in incident flux and the features on both short and long time scales produced by cosmic ray impacts on the time history , modeling glitches as discontinuities in the charge release . as seen in section  [ model.sec ] , the same values for the @xmath24 and @xmath25 parameters are used for all pixels , apart from the scaling of the @xmath25 according to the exposure time and the stabilization background level , leaving as free parameters only the charges at the beginning of the observation and at the `` peaks '' of glitches .",
    "glitches from nearby pixels are also considered when their height is substantially ( i.e. 20 times ) higher than the chosen threshold .",
    "the fitting algorithm starts with the strongest potential glitches identified in pipeline deglitching , assumes discontinuities at these positions and tries to find a fit to the time history that satisfies the model assumed to describe the solid - state physics of the detector .",
    "if no acceptable fit is found , the next fainter glitch is considered as a potential discontinuity , and so on .",
    "iteration of the fitting procedure is interrupted when either a satisfactory ( typically 0.2 adu / gain / s ) data - model rms deviation is achieved or the maximum number of allowed iterations is reached .    at this stage",
    "the code estimates several quantities needed to build the sky maps on which source extraction will then be performed .",
    "all of these quantities are `` recovered '' from glitches , i.e. already take into account discontinuities in charge release assumed to describe glitches during fit , and their list includes :    * the charges stored into the * breve * and * lunga * reservoirs at each readout . * the local background , i.e. the signal to be expected on the basis of the previously accumulated charges if only the stabilization background were hitting the detector . * the model signal , produced by the incident flux coming from both the stabilization background and detected sources .",
    "* the * `` unreconstructed '' * signal , i.e. the detected flux recovered from glitches but not from transients .",
    "this is computed as the difference between the measured signal and the local background . * the * `` reconstructed '' * signal , i.e. the detected flux recovered not only from glitches but also from transients associated with changes in incident flux .",
    "for the sake of clarity , one must emphasize here the differences between the two kinds of signals ( and the corresponding fluxes and sky maps they will finally turn into ) defined above , namely * unreconstructed * and * reconstructed * signals .",
    "both quantities take into account the effects of the stabilization background and glitches on the detector , and their values are thus expected to be negligible if a source is not illuminating the pixel at the given pointing . the difference between the two quantities only appears when an additional signal the code is not able to model otherwise ( i.e. as the effect of a glitch ) is detected and attributed to a source of a given flux .",
    "the code then models the transients expected from such an additional flux and `` reconstructs '' the signal one would detect if they did not affect the detector , i.e. if its response were instantaneous . in other words ,",
    "unreconstructed signals do not take into account the effects of this modeling of changes in incident flux , thus representing the effective charge collected during the exposure , whereas reconstructed signals recover the charge `` loss '' due to the slow detector response .",
    "therefore , the former are systematically lower than the latter . actually , simulations show that the code is not actually able to properly model transients below a certain intensity threshold , thus suggesting the use of unreconstructed signals only to carry out further processing .",
    "figure  [ fits.fig ] shows how a successful fit is able to describe cosmic - ray - induced violent changes in the signal level and thus recover useful information ( specifically , source fluxes ) from the pixel time history .",
    "panels a ) and b ) show two examples of how glitches ( a fader and a dipper , respectively ) are described as discontinuities in the signal level slowly recovering towards the stabilization background , while panels c ) and d ) show how sources are detected even on the top of strong glitches .",
    "the solid line represents the observed data , the short - dashed line the best - fit model and the long - dashed line the detected ( unreconstructed ) flux .",
    "the dot - dashed line finally represents the stabilization background     + * a ) fader * +   + * b ) dipper * +   + * c ) bright source * +   + * d ) faint source * +      after running the fitting procedure on the time history of all pixels making up a raster , the interactive analysis of fitting results is carried out , looking in detail at portions of the time history that were not well - fit by the automated analysis .",
    "the details of the interactive analysis process need to be tuned to the quality of the specific raster under consideration .",
    "in particular , the choice of thresholds in interactive checks is closely related with observing parameters such as the exposure time but also with the varying frequency and severeness of cosmic ray impacts . generally speaking ,",
    "more careful checks could be profitably carried out on intrinsically higher - quality data . on the other hand , it is desirable to ensure the most uniform data reduction as practicable .",
    "it was thus decided to adopt a common trade - off between the data quality of all rasters making up our dataset and to apply it to all rasters .    as a first step , fitting failures flagged by substantial data - model rms deviations ( higher that 0.23 adu / gain / s ) or negative signals ( lower than -0.6 adu / gain / s ) are checked .",
    "then all sizeable signal excesses ( unreconstructed signals higher than 0.5 adu / gain / s ) are individually inspected .",
    "whenever the need arises , a further fit extending to the whole pixel time history or to a smaller portion of it is carried out . particularly noisy regions or very strong individual features completely preventing data reduction",
    "are masked .",
    "the massive work of interactive analysis is carried out with an easy - to - use idl widget - based graphical user interface , a screenshot of which is shown in figure  [ gui.fig ] , which allows any kind of operation that could be necessary : data visualization and browsing , glitch addition and correction , time history masking and re - fitting .",
    "such software is the main factor allowing the increase in the volume and quality of the obtained catalogues with respect to @xcite .      once a satisfactory fit is obtained over the whole time history for all pixels",
    ", one can proceed to the generation of sky maps and to source extraction . after masking glitches and other noisy parts of the time history identified during interactive analysis ,",
    "flat - fielding is carried out and a signal estimate for each raster pointing is computed by averaging all readouts relative to that pointing .",
    "the result is converted from adu / gain / s to mjy using isocam lw3 standard sensitivity 1 mjy = 1.96 adu / gain / s .",
    "the `` images '' thus computed relative to all raster pointings are then projected onto a @xmath32 pixel sky map adopting nominal astrometric information and using a new mapping technique optimized to partly overcome the severe psf undersampling due to the large pixel size adopted in observations . here and in the following , all necessary projections are carried out using the ` projection ` c++ code included in cia . in so doing ,",
    "isocam severe field distortion @xcite was taken into account as determined by @xcite , whereas psf modeling followed the prescriptions given by @xcite for stellar psfs but adopting a spectrum of the form @xmath33 , i.e. a closer match to the expected galaxy spectrum than the rayleigh - jeans form used for stellar spectra .",
    "the resulting psf is larger than the one computed for stars .    following this procedure ,",
    "both unreconstructed and reconstructed sky maps are produced . in both cases ,",
    "two ancillary maps are also constructed . the sky coverage ( or `` npix '' ) map contains the number of independent `` images '' added together to obtain a pixel value in the final map . on the other hand ,",
    "the noise ( or `` rms '' ) map contains the estimate of the root mean square noise of each single pixel in the final map , computed by scaling the overall root mean square noise of the map as measured at its centre according to the inverse square root of the noise map .",
    "source detection is then performed on unreconstructed sky maps .",
    "first , all pixels above a conservatively low flux threshold ( 60 @xmath0jy ) are selected , then the idl astronomy user s library ` find ` routine ( based on daophot s homonymous routine , particularly suited for the detection of point - like sources in crowded fields ) is used to identify positive brightness perturbations around these pixels and return their peak flux , @xmath34 , centroid and shape parameters such as roundness and sharpness . at this stage ,",
    "further interactive checks are performed on all sources detected with a @xmath34 greater than 5 to assess their reliability .",
    "more specifically , sources detected on the sky map are projected back onto the time history to identify all raster pointings where the source is supposed to contribute a significant signal . then all these pointings are individually checked and , if necessary , refitted , to improve the fit and thus recover lost signals or remove spurious ones .",
    "the overall results of these further checks are an increased reliability and an improved astrometric and photometric accuracy .      up to this stage ,",
    "all rasters are reduced and processed individually . however , in order to fully exploit the limited redundancy of the observations , a technique to build a mosaic out of rasters covering the same field was devised .",
    "this is carried out as follows .",
    "once the reduction of all rasters of interest is completed according to the above procedure , the necessary corrections to nominal astrometry are determined as the median offset between elais source positions expressed with respect to nominal astrometry and the positions of usno a2.0 sources found in the field .",
    "this is done through a two - step process .",
    "first , the two catalogues are cross - correlated , assigning to each elais sources its closest usno association .",
    "the median of the positional differences thus determined , excluding elais sources with no usno association within 12 arcsec , is computed and assumed as a first - order correction to elais source positions .",
    "the cross - correlation procedure is then repeated to calculate a second - order astrometric correction in exactly the same way , the only difference being that elais sources with no usno identification within 3 times the root mean square deviation of elais - usno association distance are also excluded during this second step .",
    "the sum of the two corrections is assumed as the raster offset with respect to nominal astrometry , and the root mean square deviation of elais - usno distances as the error in the offset determination .",
    "deviations from nominal astrometry have long been known to be significant in iso raster observations , and this is confirmed by our results , which are summarized in table  [ offsets.tab ] .",
    "most total offsets are greater than or of the order of the pixel field of view size ( 6 arcsec ) , whereas associated errors have a mean value of 0.39 arcsec .",
    "the small errors are not only due to the careful data reduction , but also to the large number of elais sources , and largely contribute to the very good overall astrometric accuracy quantified in section  [ astroacc.sec ]",
    ".    a common mosaic grid is then built on which different rasters belonging to the same field are projected taking into account astrometric offsets .",
    "mapping , source extraction , projection of sources detected with a @xmath34 greater than 5 back on time history and interactive checks are furtherly performed on this mosaic sky map exactly as on single raster sky maps .",

    "even after a very careful reduction , flux determination is a very delicate process owing to the interplay of different factors , the most important being mapping effects related to psf undersampling , detector s transients and other trends due to the limits of the adopted reduction method .",
    "mapping effects are particularly tricky , since they determine the way one obtain source total fluxes from corresponding peak fluxes measured on sky maps by source detection software .",
    "clearly , the conversion factor between these two quantities is very much dependent on the actual source position with respect to the centre of the pixel , a source total flux being nearer to its peak flux the nearer the source is to the center of the sky map pixel .",
    "the technique we developed , which we called * autosimulation * , was conceived to model and insofar as possible take into account mapping and data reduction effects on flux determination by first constructing both real and theoretical ( i.e. noise - free ) sky maps , and then use the latter ones to correct fluxes obtained from the former ones .",
    "autosimulation consists in simulating sources , on top of noise - free maps , at each position where a source was actually detected ( or , for simulations described in section  [ simulations.sec ] , at their randomly generated positions ) , calculating the ratio between peak and total flux for the simulated source on such theoretical sky maps , and converting the measured peak flux of the real source to its total flux using such ratio .",
    "source simulation is carried out in a straightforward way using the same mathematical model the lari method is based on , thus also allowing to verify its predictions .    in order to describe how autosimulation works in some greater detail ,",
    "a few definitions and relations which will also be useful to discuss the results of simulations described in section  [ simulations.sec ] must be summarized :    * @xmath36 is the measured peak flux obtained from real ( i.e. containing glitches , noise and transients ) sky maps .",
    "its value therefore depends on mapping effects , transients and the adopted data reduction method ; * @xmath37 is the `` theoretical '' peak flux obtained from simulated ( i.e. containing neither glitches nor noise but taking into account source transients ) maps .",
    "its value depends on mapping effects and transients only . *",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 are analogous to @xmath36 and @xmath37 but are built from reconstructed maps , thus recovering the effects of transients . as already mentioned , this strictly holds above a certain flux threshold only , where the values of these quantities actually cease to depend on transients .",
    "the correction factor for mapping effects is computed as follows .",
    "a simulated source is generated on each position where a real source was actually detected , assuming a total flux @xmath40 based on the measured peak flux @xmath36 and on the average peak flux / total flux ratio @xmath41 obtained from simulations ( see section  [ simulations.sec ] and figure  [ flussivsfs.fig ] ) .",
    "then the flux estimate corrected for mapping effects is computed as @xmath42 .",
    "source simulation is carried out using the same model for charge release adopted in fitting the data . in so doing , however",
    ", autosimulation does not correct for more subtle and elusive effects arising from data reduction , such as flux loss due to bad fits , which can only be assessed through simulations .",
    "this is described in section  [ fluxdet.sec ] .",
    "such a procedure provides reliable flux estimates which are well compatible with estimates obtained through conventional aperture photometry for most sources , but is clearly non - optimal when dealing with extended sources . for these , as well as for a few very close or blended sources ,",
    "aperture photometry usually provide a better estimate of the source flux . after correcting fluxes for mapping effects ,",
    "potentially extended sources are therefore identified through both visual inspection of sky maps and the calculation of parameters connected to source extension .",
    "sources flagged by these criteria ( totalling 67 out of 1923 making up the catalogue , or 3.5% ) were then individually treated , aperture photometry with a suitable aperture radius was carried out and the result was adopted as their most reliable flux estimate . as to the overall performance of the autosimulation process when compared with aperture photometry , autosimulated fluxes and their counterparts calculated through aperture photometry are compared for all sources in section  [ autoaper.sec ] .",
    "due to the peculiar nature of iso data and of the reduction method employed , it is important to carefully test the performance of the latter on `` ideal '' data and sources . in particular ,",
    "systematic effects on flux estimates related to the data reduction method can only be probed by these means . due to the strong peculiarities of our dataset , which is characterized by several noise features on different time scales ,",
    "only real data can effectively be taken as representative of instrumental behaviour .",
    "therefore , the effects of artificial sources must be somehow simulated on the top of real pixel time histories , and data reduction must then be carried out exactly as done for real sources .",
    "source confusion in the field is thus slightly increased , but this effect is not critical for elais data .",
    "the lari method is based on a physical model of the detecto s behaviour , so can make straightforward predictions of the effect on the detector of the additional photons from simulated sources . on this basis ,",
    "an extensive set of simulations was carried out to assess the effects on flux estimates and the overall performance of data reduction in a statistically meaningful way .",
    "the s1 field was chosen for this purpose as the most representative , being the largest and including both regions observed only once and repeatedly observed regions ( hereafter , * non - repeated * and * repeated * regions , respectively ) , therefore allowing to assess the differences in performance warranted by higher redundancy .",
    "simulations were carried out as follows .",
    "first a set of @xmath43 random sky positions ( excluding regions near to real sources , mosaic sky map boundaries and masked regions of mosaic sky map , i.e. preventing simulated sources to appear nearer than 15 arcsec to any of these regions ) was generated .",
    "then a logarithmically uniform flux distribution covering the range between a lower limit @xmath44 and an upper limit @xmath45 @xmath46 was coupled with the random positions above to characterize the set of simulated sources .",
    "following the same procedure , 100 more sources were simulated ( adopting a flux distribution following the same analytical formula but covering the 0.353.5 mjy flux range ) in the repeated regions of the field , thus increasing the otherwise low number of simulated sources in these regions .",
    "all 700 sources were then projected from their sky position back onto the pixel time history , simulating their effects as superposed on glitches and noise characterizing the real data . in so doing ,",
    "all portions of time history where simulated sources were predicted to give a sizeable additional signal were identified .",
    "the fitting procedure was thus re - run on these regions only , and all steps of data reduction and flux determination were then carried out on simulated sources exactly as described in section  [ datared.sec ] for real sources . at this stage the positions and fluxes of simulated sources that had been detected with a @xmath34 greater than 5 were compared with the input values to calibrate and evaluate the performance provided by our data reduction method in different respects .",
    "the overall number of simulated and detected sources is given in table  [ simbasic.tab ] , whereas the following sections detail all relevant aspects of simulations , apart from the completeness estimates which will be described by @xcite in order to obtain extragalactic source counts .",
    ".number of simulated and detected sources .",
    "total figures are given together with those for non - repeated and repeated regions . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "a technique for iso - cam / phot data reduction , the lari method , was variously refined and applied to elais 15 @xmath0 m observations . the mathematical model for the detector s behaviour",
    "is the same as originally presented in @xcite , but thanks to various improvements , and particularly to a new graphical user interface , the method is now more robust and , most importantly , quicker and easier to apply to large datasets .",
    "its application , in the new form , to the four fields composing the dataset ( including a re - reduction of s1 observations already presented in @xcite ) has produced a catalogue of 1923 sources spanning the 0.5  100 mjy range , detected with a @xmath34 greater than 5 over a total area of @xmath47 .",
    "optical identification of 15 @xmath0 m sources has been carried out on heterogeneous optical and near - infrared imaging material , allowing to determine a robust association for about 85% of the sources and identify 22% of them as bona fide stars , furtherly demonstrating the reliability of our data reduction process .",
    "the evaluation of the catalogue s quality has been carried out through both accurate simulations and multi - wavelength identification .",
    "the astrometric accuracy is of order 1 arcsec in both ra and dec for @xmath48 , while it increases up to about 2 arcsec in both ra and dec for @xmath49 , and somewhat better for sources detected in higher - redundancy sky regions .",
    "the photometric accuracy is estimated to be below 25% over the whole range of fluxes and redundancy levels probed by our catalogue , and better than 15% for @xmath48 sources .    the comparison of measured stellar fluxes with fluxes estimated on the basis of stellar atmospehere models calibrated on iras data and on near - infrared photometry allowed to achieve an iras / iso relative photometric calibration .",
    "an iras / iso relative calibration factor of @xmath50 was determined , shedding doubts on the goodness of the two independently determined calibrations at the 10% level . for lack of a simple way to identify error sources in iras and/or iso calibratioon process ,",
    "it was decided to put our catalogue on the more commonly used iras flux scale .    in a forthcoming paper @xcite",
    "completeness estimates and extragalactic source counts from this catalogue will be presented , covering the crucial flux range 0.5  100 mjy between isocam 15 @xmath0 m deep surveys and iras all sky survey .",
    "this paper is based on observations with iso , an esa project with instruments funded by esa member states ( especially the pi countries : france , germany , the netherlands and the united kingdom ) and with the participation of isas and nasa .",
    "the isocam data presented in this paper were analysed using cia , a joint development by the esa astrophysics division and the isocam consortium .",
