    "recently there has been renewed interest in studying the distribution of quark and gluon fields in the three - quark static - baryon system .",
    "while the earliest studies were inconclusive@xcite , improved computing resources and analysis techniques now make it possible to study this system in a quantitative manner@xcite . in particular , it is possible to directly compute the gluon field distribution@xcite using lattice qcd techniques similar to those pioneered in mesonic static - quark systems@xcite .",
    "we first investigate the formation of flux tubes , where vacuum gluon field fluctuations are suppressed , in systems where the three quarks are approximately equidistant . in order to compare baryonic and mesonic flux tubes , we have further investigated three - quark static baryons where two of the quarks are close together and the third is some distance away",
    "in order to study flux - tubes on the lattice , we begin with the standard approach of connecting static quark propagators with spatial - link paths in a gauge invariant manner .",
    "we use ape - smeared spatial - link paths ( with @xmath0 and 30 smearing steps in all cases ) to propagate the quarks from a common origin to their spatial positions as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ staple ] .",
    "the static quark propagators are constructed from time directed link products at fixed spatial coordinate , @xmath1 , using the untouched ` thin' links of the gauge configuration .",
    "finally smeared - link spatial paths propagate the quarks back to the common spatial origin .",
    "the three - quark wilson loop is thus defined as : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a staple made of path - ordered link variables as shown in fig .",
    "[ staple ] .    , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , forming a three - quark wilson loop with the quarks located at @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 denote colour anti - symmetrisation at the source and sink respectively , while @xmath11 indicates evolution of the three - quark system in euclidean time.,height=113 ]    we consider y and t shaped paths in the @xmath12 plane , where the three quarks are created at the origin , then are propagated to positions @xmath13 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which approximate an equilateral triangle , before being propagated through time and finally back to a sink at the same spatial location as the source .",
    "we investigate seven such triangles , with average inter - quark distance varying from 0.27 fm to 1.7 fm .",
    "the gluon - field fluctuations are characterised by the gauge - invariant action density @xmath14 .",
    "we calculate the action density using the highly - improved @xmath15 three - loop improved lattice field - strength tensor @xcite on four - sweep ape - smeared gauge links .    for a wilson loop of euclidean time extent",
    "@xmath11 we evaluate the correlation function @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes averaging over configurations and lattice symmetries .",
    "this correlates the quark positions with the gauge - field action in a gauge invariant manner , and has the advantage of being positive definite , eliminating any sign ambiguity on whether vacuum field fluctuations are enhanced or suppressed in the presence of static quarks . for @xmath18",
    "well away from the quark positions , there are no correlations and @xmath19 .",
    "we find that @xmath20 is generally less than 1 , signaling the expulsion of vacuum fluctuations from the interior of heavy - quark hadrons .",
    "we first consider 200 quenched qcd gauge - field configurations created with the @xmath21-mean - field improved luscher - weisz plaquette plus rectangle gauge action@xcite on @xmath22 lattices at @xmath23 .",
    "the long dimension is taken as being the @xmath24 direction making the spatial volume @xmath25 . using a physical string tension of @xmath26 ,",
    "the @xmath27 potential sets the lattice spacing to @xmath28fm .",
    "we use lattice symmetries to improve the signal to noise ratio of our measurements .",
    "these include translational invariance ( any point on the lattice can be taken as the origin ) , reflection in the @xmath24 plane and @xmath29 rotational symmetry about the @xmath24-axis .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that we do not have to perform any gauge fixing to find a signal in the flux distributions .    in fig .",
    "[ ttube7-s30 ] we show examples of the expulsion of vacuum fluctuations and the formation of flux - tubes for our largest t and y shaped configurations .     is illustrated by the translucent surfaces .",

    "results are for 30-sweep smeared t - shape ( left ) and y - shape ( right ) sources with the largest quark separation considered.,title=\"fig:\",height=151 ]    a detailed analysis of these flux tubes is given elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the major conclusions can be summarised .",
    "we do not see any evidence for @xmath32 - shaped ( empty triangle ) flux tubes . at large quark separations",
    "we do see y shaped flux tubes , even from initial t shapes , which relax towards a y shape .",
    "we observe a potential which is a linear function of the minimum length of string needed to connect the quarks to the fermat point , and the extracted string tension ( @xmath33 gev @xmath34 ) is in good agreement with the quark - antiquark string tension .",
    "there has recently been a renewal of interest in the properties of diquarks in hadronic systems , as they may play an important role in the existence of exotic states , such as the putative @xmath35 , or in explaining the scarcity of such exotics@xcite . in qcd ,",
    "two quarks close together , a diquark , can transform either according to the conjugate representation @xmath36 or the sextet @xmath37 representation of @xmath38 .",
    "the color hyperfine interaction then leads to attraction in the spin singlet , scalar diquark channel , while the spin triplet , axial vector diquark is disfavoured .",
    "hence diquarks should have positive parity and belong to the color @xmath39 representation , and so have many properties similar to an antiquark . in lattice qcd this should lead to the formation of quark - diquark flux tubes with similar physical characteristics to those of quark - antiquark flux tubes .",
    "in particular we would expect the long range linear part of the quark - diquark potential to have the same slope as that of the quark - antiquark potential , corresponding to the flux tubes having the same energy density , and we would expect the flux tubes to have similar transverse size .",
    "the three - quark configurations we use to approximate a quark - diquark string are t - shapes , with the origin at the junction of the t. two quarks are positioned one lattice step in opposite directions from the origin ( approximating the diquark ) , and the third is placed from 1 to 12 lattice steps in an orthogonal direction . for this part of our work",
    "we have used 300 quenched qcd gauge field configurations created with the same action as previously .",
    "two hundred of these configurations were at at @xmath23 ( as in the previous section ) and one hundred at @xmath40 , to investigate the use of a finer lattice .",
    "these values of @xmath41 give lattice spacings @xmath42 of @xmath43 fm and @xmath44 fm respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ t - tube10 ] we show an example of the expulsion of vacuum fluctuations and the formation of flux - tubes for our quark - diquark configurations .",
    "is illustrated by the translucent surface . a surface plot ( or rubber sheet )",
    "describes the values of @xmath30 for @xmath18 in the quark plane , @xmath31.,height=188 ]    the effective potential is obtained from the wilson loops in the standard manner : @xmath45 we obtain stable plateaus for the potentials as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "the quark - antiquark potential has the well - known form @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the string tension .",
    "the three quark potential is @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is a length linking the quarks .",
    "as shown in our earlier work@xcite , @xmath50 is given by the minimum length of string that connects the three quarks , or the sum of distances from the quarks to the fermat ( or steiner ) point .",
    "we expect that the two string tensions @xmath51 and @xmath52 are equal . in fig .",
    "[ effpots ] we plot the extracted effective potentials for the quark - diquark and quark - antiquark flux - tubes at each of the values of @xmath41 for our gauge configurations .",
    "the plots show that our expectation is confirmed at both values of @xmath41 . converting length measurements from lattice units",
    "to fermi we obtain the quark - diquark string tension @xmath53 gev @xmath34 , which is in excellent agreement with the quark - antiquark string tension @xmath54 gev @xmath34 .",

    "we study the values of the correlators @xmath56 and @xmath57 where @xmath58 is constrained to the plane of the color sources , and the origin is at the position of either the antiquark or the join of the t. the quark is then at the position @xmath59 where @xmath60 varies from 2 to 12 lattice steps .",
    "first we examine the longitudinal profiles of both quark - diquark and quark - antiquark flux - tubes along the line @xmath61 in fig .",
    "[ longprofiles ] .",
    "as expected , the vacuum expulsion close to the diquark is stronger than in the vicinity of the antiquark .",
    "however , near the quark the two flux tubes show very similar profiles .",
    "similar results are seen at @xmath62 .",
    "at all longitudinal separations.,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]   at all longitudinal separations.,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]    next we examine the transverse profiles along a line orthogonal to the midpoint of the flux tube , _ ie .",
    "_ along @xmath63 for @xmath60 even , or along @xmath64 for @xmath60 odd . in fig",
    "[ trprofiles ] we show profiles of both quark - diquark and quark - antiquark flux - tubes for @xmath65 .",
    "we find that as long as @xmath60 is larger than 4 lattice steps , the transverse profiles are close to identical . in earlier work @xcite",
    "we saw that the profiles saturate for long enough euclidean time evolution . using a fit to a gaussian profile",
    "we find that the transverse profiles of quark - diquark and quark - antiquark flux - tubes are statistically identical@xcite .",
    "( solid lines ) and @xmath55 ( dashed lines).,width=188 ]",
    "we have directly compared gluon flux - tubes for quark plus antiquark and three quark systems . in the three quark systems we kept two quarks close together ( two lattice units separation ) , so that the system approximates a quark - diquark string .",
    "we found that the string tension in the quark - diquark string was the same as for the quark - antiquark string .",
    "in addition we compared the vacuum expulsion in both sets of flux - tubes .",
    "we found that , in the vicinity of the quark , there was no measurable difference between the transverse profiles of the quark - diquark flux - tubes and the quark - antiquark flux - tubes .",
    "these findings confirm the expectation from qcd that a diquark has many properties in common with an antiquark .",
    "in particular the long range color interaction between a diquark and a quark is seen to be the same as that between an antiquark and a quark .",
    "it would be interesting to repeat this work with dynamical quarks , where the effect of screening by quark - antiquark pairs could be observed .",
