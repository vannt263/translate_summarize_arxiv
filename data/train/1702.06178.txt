    "on august 25 , 2012 , the solar wind particles ( with energy of 10 s of kevs ) measured by voyager 1 dropped to noise level as it crossed into the interstellar medium ( stone et al .",
    "based on the measured heliospheric asymmetries there was the prediction ( izmodenov et al .",
    "2009 ; opher et al . 2006 , 2009 ,",
    "pogorelov et al .",
    "2007 ) that the direction of interstellar magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) would be highly inclined with respect to the east - west direction of solar magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the expectation was of a dramatic rotation of the magnetic field direction at the heliopause . however , when voyager 1 crossed the heliopause ( hp ) , observations ( burlaga et al .",
    "2013 ) revealed that the magnetic field had almost no change in the direction or magnitude .",
    "these observations sparked suggestions that the conditions seen by voyager 1 could be explained by temporal instabilities or flux transfer events ( krimigis et al .",
    "2013 ; florinski et al . 2015 ; schwadron & mccomas 2013 , borovikov & pogorelov 2014 ) .",
    "now that voyager 1 has been in the interstellar medium ( ism ) more than three years ( burlaga et al .",
    "2016 ) ( or @xmath4 past the heliopause ) and is observing nearly constant orientation and magnitude of @xmath0 , temporal processes can be ruled out .",
    "previously we suggested ( opher & drake 2013 ) that the draping @xmath0 around the heliopause is strongly affected by the solar magnetic field although the physical mechanism for such behavior was not understood .",
    "we showed in magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations that as @xmath0 approaches the heliopause , it twists and acquires an east - west component , which did not occur if the solar magnetic field was not present .",
    "it was suggested that the draping of @xmath0 around the heliopause could explain the twist of @xmath0 and the voyager 1 observations ( isenberg et al .",
    "2015 , grygorczuk et al . , 2014 ) . here",
    ", we present an alternative idea , that magnetic reconnection at the eastern flank of the heliosphere is responsible for most of the twist of the interstellar magnetic field outside of the hp along the voyager 1 trajectory .    in global mhd simulations",
    "( opher et al 2015 , pogorelov et al 2015 , izmodenov and alexashov 2015 ) the solar magnetic field in the heliosheath twists in the negative n direction on the eastern flank , opposing that of @xmath0 , which has a positive n component .",
    "we show that physical conditions allow reconnection to proceed between @xmath0 and the solar magnetic field in the eastern flank while being suppressed at the nose . a rotational discontinuity ( rd )",
    "forms at the reconnection site on the eastern flank and propagates upstream of the nose .",
    "the consequence is that there is a finite band of reconnected field lines outside of the hp where the magnetic field is mostly in the t direction and the elevation angle @xmath1 is close to the solar value , consistent with the voyager 1 measurements .",
    "once voyager 1 crosses the domain where the rd of the reconnected field has propagated upstream it will measure larger values of @xmath5 and the associated angle @xmath6 . here",
    "the t and n direction refer to the rtn coordinate system that is the cartesian system centered in the spacecraft .",
    "r is radially outward from the sun , t is in the plane of the solar equator and is positive in the direction of solar rotation , and n completes a right - handed system .",
    "we use the same model as in opher et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , a multi - fluid magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) 3d model with one ionized fluid and four fluids for the neutral h component ( opher et al .",
    "2009 ) based on the 3d multi - fluid mhd code bats - r - us with adaptive mesh refinement ( toth et al . 2012 ) .",
    "the multi - fluid approach for the neutrals captures the main features of the kinetic model ( izmodenov et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the inner boundary of our domain is a sphere at @xmath7au and the outer boundary is at @xmath8au , @xmath9au , @xmath10au .",
    "parameters of the solar wind at the inner boundary at @xmath7au are : @xmath11 km / s , @xmath12 , @xmath13k ( omni solar data , http://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ) . the mach number of the solar wind is @xmath14 and is therefore super - fast - magnetosonic",
    ". therefore all the flow parameters can be specified at this boundary .",
    "the magnetic field is given by the parker spiral magnetic field ( parker 1958 ) .",
    "we assume that the magnetic axis is aligned with the solar rotation axis . the solar wind flow at the inner boundary is assumed to be spherically symmetric .",
    "the coordinate system is such that the z - axis is parallel to the solar rotation axis , the x - axis is @xmath15 above the direction of interstellar flow with y completing the right - handed coordinate system .",
    "we use a monopole configuration for the solar magnetic field .",
    "this description while capturing the topology of the field line does nt capture its change of polarity with solar cycle or across the heliospheric current sheet .",
    "this choice , however , minimizes artificial reconnection effects , especially in the heliospheric current sheet .",
    "such procedure was used by other groups ( e.g. , izmodenov et al .",
    "2015 , zirnstein et al .",
    "we chose the solar field polarity that corresponds to solar cycle 24 , with the azimuthal angle @xmath16 ( between the radial and t directions in heliospheric coordinates ) @xmath17 in the north and south .",
    "the interstellar magnetic field has a t component of @xmath17 as detected by voyager 1 .",
    "such configuration minimizes reconnection at the nose ( figure 1a ) .",
    "here we show results from two different simulations with different orientations for the @xmath0 .",
    "model a has the @xmath0 in the hydrogen deflection plane ( hdp ) ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 in ecliptic longitude and latitude , respectively ) consistent with the measurements of deflection of he atoms with respect to the h atoms ( lallement et al . 2005 ; 2010 ) .",
    "model b is the one used in works that constrain the orientation of @xmath0 based on the circularity of the ibex ribbon and the ribbon location ( zirnstein et al .",
    "2016 ) ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 in ecliptic longitude and latitude , respectively ) .",
    "the specific orientation of @xmath0 for the present paper is not important since the solar wind conditions are idealized so the exact shape of the heliosphere is not important .",
    "the main point of this paper depends on the fact that the interstellar field is highly inclined to the east - west direction , which is true for both cases .",
    "model a has @xmath22km / s , @xmath23 , @xmath24k .",
    "model b has @xmath25km / s , @xmath26 , @xmath27k .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath0 is @xmath28nt ( model a ) and @xmath29 nt ( model b ) .",
    "the number density of h atoms in the interstellar medium is @xmath30 ( model a ) and @xmath31 ( model b ) .",
    "models a and b were run to 260,000 time steps which corresponds to 231 years with @xmath32 cells with resolution equivalent to the one used in ( opher et al .",
    "2016 ) with minimum grid resolution of @xmath33 au near the hp and @xmath34 au farther out . for model b",
    "we then used adaptive mesh refinement to create a high - resolution grid around the hp ( @xmath35 au at the hp and @xmath36 au along the voyager 1 trajectory resulting in @xmath37 cells .",
    "the hp is defined as temperature iso - surface with @xmath38k ( figure 1a )",
    "we recently found that the magnetic tension of the solar magnetic field plays a crucial role in organizing the solar wind ( opher et al . 2015 ; drake et al . 2015 ) in the heliosheath into two jet - like structures .",
    "the heliosphere then has a `` croissant - like shape '' where the distance to the heliopause downtail is almost the same as towards the nose .",
    "this new view is vastly different from the standard picture of the heliosphere as a comet - shape like structure with the tail extending for 1000 s of aus .",
    "however , we argue here that the detailed of the shape of the heliosphere far downstream is less important than the orientation of the solar magnetic field as it convects downstream , which is the same in all of the global models . as shown in opher et al .",
    "2015 and opher et al .",
    "2016 the solar magnetic field ( shown in red - figure 1 ) as it convects down the tail maintains a `` tube - like '' topology that is bent due to the flow of interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the bent tube topology twists the solar magnetic field , which is initially in the ( east - west ) t direction at the nose , towards the n direction in the flanks ( figure 1a ) .",
    "this magnetic geometry of the solar magnetic field is also seen in global mhd simulations that display an extended tail ( pogorelov et al .",
    "therefore , regardless of whether the tail is split or not , the solar magnetic field is mostly in the n direction in the flanks .",
    "a @xmath0 that has positive t and negative r and n components first contacts the heliosphere in the south - east hemisphere ( where east and west refers to a view from the ism towards the sun ) ( figure 1a ) . on the eastern flank it encounters the solar magnetic field that is mostly oriented in the positive n direction ( for the chosen polarity of the solar magnetic field ) .",
    "the n components of the solar and interstellar field reconnect ( figure 1a ) , leaving a remnant positive guide - field component @xmath39 .",
    "once reconnection occurs it creates a pair of field lines , one of which is the solar magnetic field that now is open to the interstellar medium ( figure 1b ) .",
    "a second reconnection can happen with another @xmath0 field line ( figure 1c ) that leads to a reconnected magnetic field that is open at both ends into the ism ( figure 1d ) .",
    "the field lines then get convected and stretched towards the northern and southern poles ( figure 1d- right panel ) . as the ism gets convected towards the heliosphere new ism field lines wrap around the heliosphere and the cycle repeats .",

    "the generation of pickup ions should therefore be much less efficient in the flanks .",
    "the consequence is that because of the reduced jump in @xmath2 across the hp in the flanks , reconnection will be much more robust there than in the nose ( swisdak et al 2010 ) .    in the ism the alfvn speed ( @xmath47 km / s ) is higher than the interstellar flows around the heliopause ( @xmath48 km / s ) so the rd will be able to propagate along @xmath0 into the nose region outside of the hp .",
    "also because the plasma @xmath2 is low the reconnected field lines affected by flank reconnection will contain only interstellar plasma in the nose region outside of the hp .    once the rd reaches the nose it rotates the magnetic field lines ahead of the hp into the t direction ( fig .",

    "in this paper , we present a model that establishes a physical basis for the twisting of the interstellar magnetic field @xmath0 into the direction of the solar magnetic field outside of the hp as measured by voyager 1 .",
    "this twist was reported in mhd simulations of the global heliosphere ( opher & drake 2013 ) but the physics basis for this behavior was not identified . here",
    "we show that the twist of @xmath0 outside of the hp is a consequence of magnetic reconnection on the eastern flank of the heliosphere , which locally reduces the n component of @xmath0 and propagates to the nose as a rotational discontinuity ( rd ) .    what happens if the periodic reversal ( due to solar cycle ) in the solar magnetic field is included in the model ?",
    "when the solar field changes sign , reconnection in the western flank will be favored but there should again be an rd upstream of the hp .",
    "it seems more likely , however , that because the flows in the hs are slow , a mixture of directions of solar field lines are likely to be present so that reconnection at both flanks is likely to influence the structure of the magnetic field outside of the hp .",
    "such more complex behavior remains to be explored but is unlikely to change the fact that the normal component of @xmath0 is reduced outside of the hp .",
    "voyager 1 has been outside the hp for four years and continues to measure an elevation angle @xmath6 that is close to the solar value in the heliosheath .",
    "based on the new flank reconnection picture , we predict that voyager 1 will move to a region where @xmath0 is causally disconnected ( by the alfvnic rd ) from the flank reconnection site and the angle @xmath6 will increase to its pristine interstellar value .",
    "when a magnetic field line touches the flank and starts to reconnect , the rd will begin propagating upstream . from the simulation",
    "we can estimate the time that will take for the rd to propagate upstream .",
    "the alfvn speed at the reconnection site is around @xmath52 . given that the distance of the reconnection site to the nose is around @xmath53 au it will take @xmath54 years for the rd to propagate upstream .",
    "estimating the stand - off distance of the rd from the hp is complicated , because the field lines upstream in the simulation are already affected by the draping .",
    "the stand - off distance will vary depending on the orientation of @xmath0 . in any case , the simulation data suggest that @xmath0 will return to its pristine value @xmath3 past the hp . similar behavior should eventually be expected at voyager 2 .",
    "our mhd model , which has led to the flank reconnection picture , is based on the assumption that large - scale reconnection does not take place in the nose region of the hp .",
    "we enforce this in the model by imposing a monopole solar magnetic field with an orientation such that reconnection does not take place with the interstellar magnetic field at the nose of the hp . in the eastern flank , however , the solar magnetic field twists to the n direction and reconnection take place . of course , such a model , which was implemented to reduce spurious numerical reconnection in the nose region is not physical .    however , there are solid physics grounds for thinking that reconnection in the flanks of the heliosphere will be much more robust than in the nose region .",
    "it is well - known that mhd simulations do not adequately describe magnetic reconnection , primarily because of the kinetic length scales that develop during collisionless reconnection ( birn et al 2001 ) .",
    "one of the important kinetic effects missed by mhd models is the stabilizing effect of diamagnetic drifts , which develop at boundaries such as the earth s magnetopause or the hp ( swisdak et al . , 2003 ; 2010 ) .",
    "the stabilizing influence of these drifts has been extensively documented with solar wind and magnetospheric satellite data ( phan et al 2010 , phan et al 2013 ) .",
    "the diamagnetic drift suppresses reconnection when the drift speed is larger that the alfvn speed based on the reconnecting magnetic field .",
    "the stabilization condition can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the jump in @xmath2 across the hp , @xmath57 is the angle between the magnetic fields on the two sides of the hp and @xmath58 is the typical pressure scale length across the hp , and @xmath59 is the ion inertial length ( with @xmath60 the ion plasma frequency ) .",
    "typically , @xmath61 is of order of 1 ( swisdak et al .",
    "2010 ) . only nearly anti - parallel",
    "reconnection occurs for @xmath62 .    in the nose region of the hs ,",
    "the plasma @xmath2 is large and is dominated by the pickup ions ( puis ) produced in the high - speed solar wind upstream of the ts .",
    "this is in contrast to the low plasma @xmath2 of the interstellar medium .",
    "the voyager 1 spacecraft can not measure the puis , which downstream of the ts have energies greater than a @xmath63kev . however , estimates based solely on suprathermal tails ( @xmath64 ) yield @xmath65 ( krimigis et al .",
    "therefore , we expect that diamagnetic effects will suppress reconnection in the nose region of the hp except in localized regions where the magnetic fields across the hp are nearly anti - parallel .",
    "this constraint should limit the scale size of magnetic islands at the hp to a few au ( swisdak et al 2013 , strumik et al 2014 ) .",
    "the interstellar medium neutrals stream into the heliosphere from the direction of the nose , across the hs and into the high - speed solar wind , where they charge exchange . in the flanks",
    "the flux of neutral atoms across the hs and into the high - speed solar wind is reduced because the neutral h atoms are moving nearly tangent to the hp and ts . on the flanks",
    "the production of puis should be greatly reduced compared with the nose region .",
    "the consequence is that the plasma @xmath2 in the hs is much lower in the flanks compared with the nose and diamagnetic stabilization of reconnection will not take place in the flanks of the hp .",
    "thus , magnetic reconnection will be much more robust in the flanks than in the nose .",
    "while the physics of diamagnetic stabilization is not present in our mhd model the use of the monopole solar magnetic field , which suppresses reconnection at the nose in the end has the same effect : hp reconnection is suppressed in the nose and remains robust at in the flanks .",
