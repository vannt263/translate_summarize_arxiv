    "first and foremost is the inference that the ocean is in fact too cold for @xmath0  ignition at the inferred column depth @xmath10 .",
    "this comes from fits @xcite to the quiescent cooling of the quasi - persistent transient ks  1731@xmath14  @xcite , a system that also exhibited a superburst @xcite .",
    "the timescale for the quiescent luminosity to decrease suggests that the crust s thermal conductivity is high ; as a result , the inner crust temperature remains close to that of the core even during the accretion outburst .",
    "@xcite reach the same conclusion for mxb  1659@xmath15  ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "heavy - ion fusion hindrance increases @xmath17 by at least a factor of @xmath18 @xcite .",

    "detection of a superburst from the classical transient 4u  1608@xmath19  @xcite with @xmath10 @xcite exacerbates all three problems : ( 1 ) the transient s inferred ocean temperature is lower than those of other systems exhibiting superbursts , ( 2 ) heavy ion fusion hindrance is greater at lower temperatures , and ( 3 ) most of the matter accreted onto the neutron star prior to the observed superburst likely burned during helium - triggered type i x - ray bursts , which current theoretical calculations suggest would generate far less @xmath0  than that required for ignition .",

    "electron captures onto protons and the subsequent captures of the resulting neutrons onto heavy nuclei liberate @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "prethreshold captures of super - fermi electrons are very temperature sensitive and therefore could trigger an energetic thermonuclear flash .",
    "an attractive feature of this mechanism is that ignition occurs always at the same electron chemical potential ; thus @xmath17 would be similar for all superbursts , in accord with observations .",
    "unfortunately , the calculated @xmath21 is much smaller than the inferred superburst @xmath17 , making it an unlikely trigger mechanism .",
    "this motivates our investigation of exothermic electron captures onto heavy nuclei , which occur throughout the ocean and crust of an accreting neutron star , including the superburst ignition region @xcite . in  [ s.ecz ] we determine the thermal stability of electron captures onto heavy nuclei in accreting neutron stars .",

    "we address these problems below in the context of our results .",
    "\\(1 ) the results of all previous superburst models imply that ocean temperatures are too low for @xmath0  ignition at the inferred @xmath10 .",
    "a strong resonance near @xmath2 in the @xmath0  + @xmath0  system would decrease the temperature required for ignition at @xmath10 from @xmath291 to @xmath292 .",
    "\\(2 ) heavy - ion fusion hindrance would imply that the standard @xmath238-factor overestimates the true @xmath0  + @xmath0  fusion rate .",
    "this existence of such hindrance is currently speculative for both @xmath0  + @xmath0  in particular @xcite and exothermic fusion reactions in general @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the effect heavy - ion fusion hindrance has on resonant reactions is unknown .",
    "therefore , it is unclear whether heavy - ion fusion hindrance poses a problem for superburst ignition .",
    "\\(3 ) the @xmath0  yield from nucleosynthesis models is often lower than that required for a thermal instability .",
    "a strong resonance would reduce the minimum @xmath0  abundance required for a superburst , but by only a small amount .",
    "thus , this problem would be attenuated but not resolved .",
    "our result has implications for @xmath16 reactions in other contexts , namely type ia supernovae and massive stellar evolution .",
    "in addition , we have also presented a general prescription for understanding the screening enhancement factor in a multicomponent plasma .",
    "we briefly describe each of these topics before concluding with an outlook on future measurements .",
    "the fusion of @xmath0  is an important stage in the post",
    " main - sequence evolution of a massive star , and it is the reaction that ignites a white dwarf and triggers a thermonuclear ( type ia ) supernova . in both systems ,",
    "the competition between heating from the @xmath16 reaction and cooling from neutrino emissions determines ignition . to explore the implications of a resonance in the reaction cross - section on these phenomena , we construct ignition curves ( fig .",

    "we compute the neutrino emissivity for the pair , photo , plasma , and bremsstrahlung processes using analytical fitting formulae @xcite . for @xmath296 , we use the effective reaction @xmath22-value of @xmath297 @xcite , which includes heating from both the @xmath298- and @xmath23- branches and subsequent reactions ; the ignition curve is insensitive to the choice of @xmath22 .",

    "as is evident from figure [ f.ignition ] , the effect of a resonance at @xmath299 is minimal for the ignition of type ia supernovae , which are thought to ignite at central densities @xmath302 ( see , e.  g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is interesting to speculate that a resonance at a lower energy might shift the ignition curve to lower densities .",
    "this would reduce the _ in situ _ neutronization of the nickel - peak material synthesized in the explosive burning and the neutronization during the pre - explosive convective burning @xcite ; moreover , numerical simulations @xcite find that a lower central density reduces the growth of the turbulent flame velocity ( because the lower gravitational acceleration decreases the growth rate of the rayleigh - taylor instability ) , which leads to a less vigorous explosion and a decreased production of iron - peak elements .",
    "although lower densities are necessary to avoid overproduction of neutron - rich isotopes such as @xmath303  and @xmath304  @xcite , this may be ameliorated by improved electron capture rates onto @xmath305-shell nuclei @xcite . moreover , there is observational evidence that the majority of supernovae do undergo electron - captures in the innermost @xmath306 of ejecta @xcite .",
    "given the uncertainties in modeling the progenitor evolution , flame ignition , and explosion , and in the dependence of the ignition density on the accretion history of the white dwarf ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent discussion ) , we do not think it possible to constrain the existence of such a resonance from observations at this time , but future modeling efforts should clearly allow for this possibility .    intriguingly , the largest effect is at @xmath307 , which is the region encountered by post",
    " main - sequence massive stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "stellar evolutionary calculations , which include the shock - induced explosive nucleosynthesis , find that a decrease in the @xmath16 rate leads to enhancements in @xmath308 and @xmath309 abundances @xcite .",
    "further calculations are needed to determine whether an enhanced @xmath16 rate would produce interesting changes in nucleosynthesis .      in  [ s.lmrdeviations ] we showed that heavy spectator ions increase the plasma screening enhancement to the thermonuclear reaction rate via linear mixing rule deviations . to our knowledge , this work is the first to show that spectator ions affect the plasma screening enhancement in the thermonuclear regime .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , not on fusion reactions .    in our analysis",
    ", we tacitly assumed the plasma is uniformly mixed .",
    "however , recent molecular dynamics simulations of multicomponent plasmas exhibit clustering of low-@xmath27 ions @xcite , which may enhance the reaction rate .",
    "this is worthy of further investigation .    for completeness",
    ", we note that linear mixing rule deviations are much larger for coulomb solids @xcite .",
    "this has two consequences for accreting neutron stars : ( 1 ) screening enhancements for multicomponent plasmas in the pycnonuclear regime may be orders of magnitude greater than currently thought .",
    "this could lower the pressures at which pycnonuclear reactions occur in the crust and thereby heat the ocean to a larger extent .",
    "( 2 ) a multicomponent plasma s freezing temperature is much lower than that of a one - component plasma .",
    "this possibly explains the results of @xcite , whose molecular dynamics simulation of a multicomponent plasma froze at @xmath310 rather than the typical @xmath311 of a one - component plasma .",
