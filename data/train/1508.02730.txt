    "some of the discrepancies between observational and theoretical results can be mitigated when internal evolutionary processes ( e.g. , `` feedback '' from star formation and supernovae ) and external processes ( e.g. , reionization , tidal stripping , ram pressure stripping ) are taken into account .",
    "the details of how and when these processes occur , and what effect they have on the galaxies , are complicated ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the net effect , however , may be that the cold baryons in nascent galaxies become so depleted that it is impossible for the galaxies to form stars .",
    "alternatively , feedback may limit the star formation that does occur to only one generation of stars , rendering any stellar population that is present undetectable given our current observational capabilities and the limitations of the surveys completed so far .    in order to both explore the `` missing satellites '' problem and to investigate the complex interplay between low - mass dark matter halos , their baryonic components , and the gas and stellar processes that shape them , we have initiated a project to obtain optical observations of a specific class of candidate low - mass galaxies discovered via their neutral hydrogen emission .",
    "these objects were identified by the arecibo legacy fast alfa ( alfalfa ) neutral hydrogen ( hi ) survey @xcite .",
    "the alfalfa survey uses data from the arecibo 305-m telescope to map 7000 deg@xmath8 of the sky in the hi 21 cm line at an angular resolution of @xmath9 and a spectral resolution of @xmath55 km  s@xmath10 .",

    "the selection of these uchvcs is described in @xcite ; briefly , sources included in the sample must have @xmath13 km s@xmath10  to exclude galactic hi sources , a diameter less than 30 in size , and a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath14 .",
    "sources must also be well - isolated from larger hi structures and previously known high - velocity clouds .",
    "notably , while they are compact , the uchvcs are generally spatially resolved .",

    "we are using the wiyn observatory to image the uchvcs in order to investigate whether these objects are indeed nearby dwarf galaxies and , if possible , to study their optical emission and stellar populations .",
    "a dwarf galaxy located just outside the local group was recently identified using this type of approach : leo p , a gas - rich , star - forming dwarf galaxy with @xmath20 and a distance of @xmath21 mpc , was discovered via its alfalfa hi detection and follow - up optical imaging with wiyn @xcite .",

    "i.e. , hi source identification followed by optical imaging to identify a detectable stellar population and provide a distance estimate  has thus been shown to be a potentially important path for finding more local volume dwarfs , for placing limits on how many nearby low - mass galaxies may remain undetected , and for understanding how such previously - unknown dwarf galaxies fit in with the rest of the nearby galaxy population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we present our observational strategy , analysis methods , and techniques for detecting stellar populations in the optical follow - up images of the alfalfa - detected uchvcs .",

    "not surprisingly , applying the method to the former field yields an unambiguous detection of the resolved stellar population of leo  p. applying the method to the agc198606 field yields a possible detection of an optical counterpart to this hi source , even though ( as noted in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) no conspicuous stellar counterpart is present in the images .",

    ", nine 300-second exposures were executed in a preset dither pattern in both the sdss @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters , with some targets also observed in sdss @xmath27 .",
    "the majority of data collection for this project took place in march and april 2013 , with additional observations acquired in march , may , and october 2014 .",
    "future data collection will use an upgraded wiyn odi camera with a @xmath28 field of view .",
    "observations and data analysis are ongoing ; this paper presents the result of our efforts to establish the image processing methods and analysis techniques for the project .",
    "the seeing , as characterized by the full width half maximum of the point spread function ( fwhmpsf ) , in the images we have acquired so far ranges between 0.7  and 1.3 .",
    "the particular dataset presented in later sections is representative of both the image quality and depth of the podi observations we have obtained to date .",
    "raw images were transferred to the odi pipeline , portal , and archive ( odi - ppa * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at indiana university , then processed using the quickreduce data reduction pipeline @xcite to remove the instrumental signature .",
    "the quickreduce pipeline includes standard bias , dark , and flat corrections , as well as a pupil ghost correction , non - linearity corrections , cosmic - ray removal , and fringe removal where necessary . to account for image artifacts that remain after the quickreduce processing",
    ", we constructed and applied an illumination correction by creating a dark - sky flat derived from the science observations . to create the flat on a filter - by - filter basis , we first masked all objects in the images , combined the masked images into a single image with a median algorithm , and then applied a smoothing kernel to the combined image to construct the final dark - sky flat field .",
    "we then divided each individual podi image by the appropriate dark - sky flat field .",
    "this illumination correction was necessary in order to remove artifacts from mis - matched sky levels between dithered images .",
    "the final result is very flat images over the full field - of - view of the camera @xcite .",
    "the processed object images were then combined by scaling each image to a common flux level using sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) dr9 catalog stars @xcite in the field , when available , to account for varying sky transparency .",
    "additionally , we used the dr9 catalog stars to determine photometric solutions , and projected all individual images of the same field to a common pixel scale defined by the sdss stars world coordinate system ( wcs ) solution . finally , the processed object images were stacked into a single combined image in each filter for each uchvc field .",
    "a common set of steps is executed on each of the final combined images .",
    "first , the images are cropped in order to remove the higher - noise edges of the dither pattern , leaving the central @xmath520  by 20of the pointing .",
    "the mean standard deviation of the background level is measured in @xmath510@xmath620 empty regions of the image .",
    "using iraf tasks ` daofind ` and ` phot ` , we identify all sources with peak counts at least @xmath29 times the background noise level and measure their instrumental magnitudes .",
    "we explored the use of lower ` daofind ` thresholds but found that lower detection thresholds typically produced a large number of spurious sources without finding any additional genuine objects .",
    "we then mask out saturated stars ( with diffraction spikes and/or bleed trails ) and bright background galaxies and remove spurious sources with undefined magnitudes . to create a single list of sources appearing in both filters",
    ", we match sources in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 images and then measure the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the radial profile of each matched source .",
    "obviously extended objects , with large fwhm values in a plot of fwhm vs. instrumental magnitude , are removed .",
    "the fwhm above which we remove objects varies as a function of the instrumental magnitude , but a representative value is 1.5 times the mean stellar fwhm derived from bright stars in the image . an aperture correction is determined for each image and applied to the measured instrumental magnitudes of the remaining sources .",
    "we convert these instrumental magnitudes to calibrated magnitudes by applying the zero points and color terms calculated from the sdss stars in the images .",
    "galactic reddening corrections are determined from @xcite and then applied to produce the final set of magnitudes and colors . at the end of this process ,",
    "the podi images with good seeing ( fwhmpsf @xmath30 0.8  ) typically yield @xmath31 sources and a @xmath32 limit on the brightness of a point source of @xmath525 magnitude in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters .",
    "our objective is to search for the resolved stellar population of the optical counterpart for each uchvc we observe .",
    "we follow a similar strategy to that outlined in @xcite and @xcite , making adjustments as appropriate for our data set .",
    "the first step is to apply a filter in color - magnitude space to the calibrated photometry of the sources in each field .    to construct a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) filter ,",
    "we select @xcite isochrones for both old ( @xmath33gyr @xmath34 ) and young ( @xmath33myr @xmath35 ) stellar populations .",
    "because isolated hi clouds are unlikely to be highly chemically enriched by the products of stellar evolution , we use the metallicity range of @xmath36 to @xmath37 ( 1/200 to 1/50 of the solar value ) subsets for each age group to further define the filter . the extent in color - magnitude space ( i.e. , in the @xmath38 vs. @xmath39 plane ) covered by these isochrones is used to define the outer boundaries of the cmd filter .",
    "figure [ filterconstruct ] shows the isochrones selected to construct the filter , as well as the final cmd filter we adopt .",
    "we note that for some fields , such as the agc198606 field ( section [ section:198606 ] ) , there is no evidence of bright , blue stars or ongoing star formation . in such cases",
    "we apply a cmd filter that includes only the old stellar population , because there are simply no stars in the region of the cmd where young stars would appear .",
    "before it is applied to the source photometry , the cmd filter is projected to a given distance within the local volume by adding the appropriate distance modulus to the @xmath38 value of the original filter .",
    "we shift the filter so as to sample the range of distances over which we expect to be able to detect stellar counterparts to the uchvcs : from 250 kpc ( the closest distance at which we expect to find dark matter halos with a significant hi counterpart ; @xcite , @xcite ) to 2.5 mpc ( the distance to the farthest observable red giant branch star in a typical image from our data set ) . in terms of the distance modulus , we sample a range of @xmath40 values from 22.0 to 27.0 in steps of 0.4 magnitude . when we find a potentially significant detection in the filtering / smoothing process , we re - sample the range of @xmath40 values around which the detection occurs with a more finely - spaced grid , in order to determine a more precise distance for the putative counterpart .",
    "the calibrated magnitude and color of each source is tested to determine whether the source falls within the cmd filter that corresponds to a specific distance .",
    "the source passes the test if its position in the @xmath1 versus @xmath39 plane falls within the boundaries of the cmd filter or if the @xmath41 error bars ( in either the magnitude or color direction ) for the source overlap the filter boundaries .",
    "this has the effect of widening the cmd filter at fainter magnitudes .",
    "once stars have been selected with the cmd filter at a given distance , we smooth the stars spatial distribution on the expected scale of a dwarf galaxy .",
    "this smoothing is achieved by first binning the remaining filtered stars into a grid with bin size @xmath42  @xmath43  .",
    "we will refer to the bins in this grid as pixels , since in essence they represent a low - resolution image of the field .",
    "we then convolve each pixel in the grid with a gaussian kernel with a size roughly equivalent to the spatial scale we expect for a nearby dwarf galaxy ( fwhm @xmath44 2 arcmin ) .",
    "this spatial scale is comparable to the optical extent of the dwarf galaxies leo  t ( half - light radius @xmath45 arcmin ; * ? ? ? * ) and leo  p ( optical extent @xmath46 arcsec ; * ? ? ?",
    "pixels in the convolved image ( which we call @xmath47 , following the convention of @xcite ) with larger signal correspond to areas of the wiyn image with higher surface densities of stars that have passed the cmd filter criteria .",
    "we test whether these pixels contain genuine overdensities by calculating the mean signal level and its standard deviation over the entire @xmath47 image .",
    "we then calculate a new image , @xmath48 , such that    @xmath49    where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are , respectively , the mean and standard deviation of the pixel values in @xmath47 .",
    "this new image ( @xmath48 ) effectively gives us the strength of the signal in @xmath47 by measuring the number of standard deviations a given pixel is above or below the mean signal level , and provides an easy way to identify overdensities in the field .    to evaluate the outcome of the filtering and smoothing process",
    ", we implement a technique that allows us to quantify the likelihood that an overdensity of a given strength ( as defined in the @xmath48 image ) is a legitimate detection of a possible optical counterpart rather than simply a stochastic variation .",
    "we use a monte carlo technique and generate 25000 samples of uniformly - distributed random points in a square 20  on a side , which is equal to the field - of - view of our cropped wiyn podi images .",
    "the number of objects in each of the 25000 realizations is set equal to the number of point sources that pass the cmd filter criteria for a given field .",
    "we then perform the smoothing steps described above for each random realization and track the strength of the pixel with the highest signal level in the resultant @xmath48 image .",
    "an example distribution of these peak values for a sample size of 400 point sources is shown in figure [ peakdist ] .",
    "for each field and each application of the cmd filter , we can compare the peak overdensity value derived from the real , observed image data to the distribution of values generated from the random - sample data .",
    "in this way we can estimate the statistical significance of a given peak in the observed @xmath48 image and assign a robust confidence level to detections .",
    "this is especially useful for images in which a marked overdensity is detected but which have no visually obvious optical counterpart .",

    "[ peakdist ] ]",
    "to illustrate our detection method , we apply it to images of the galaxy leo  p , which was discovered by alfalfa , originally identified as a uchvc based on its hi properties , and found through optical imaging to be a dwarf galaxy in the local volume @xcite .",
    "we analyzed the original @xcite images of leo  p , obtained with wiyn and minimosaic in march 2012 .",
    "since these images were taken with broadband @xmath52 filters , the photometry measured by @xcite was converted from @xmath52 to @xmath0 and @xmath1 using the stellar color transformations from @xcite . after making slight adjustments to the smoothing and significance testing methods described in section [ section : filter ] to account for the difference in the field - of - view ( @xcite analyzed a 9.6  by 4.8  portion of the minimosaic pointing ) we applied our filtering and smoothing technique to the photometric measurements of leo  p. we utilized a cmd filter that included both young and old stellar populations as well as a filter that included _ only _ old stellar populations .",
    "both filters produced highly significant detections ; here we give the detailed results from applying the old stellar population filter for better comparison with the agc198606 results given in section [ section:198606 ] .",

    "[ leopdetect ] , we show the result of the filtering and smoothing method applied at the measured distance of leo  p from @xcite ( distance modulus 26.20 ; 1.738 mpc ) , which is also the most significant detection of leo  p found with our search method .",

    "here we show a 2diameter circle , centered on the location of the most significant density peak . in the bottom right panels , we show cmds of the stars inside the circle ( putative members of leo  p ) , and in a randomly placed reference circle . we see that the cmd of stars inside the circle clearly includes a vertical feature at @xmath54 , associated with leo  p s blue main sequence .",
    "this is an example of the kind of distinguishing feature we might expect to see by examining the cmd of stars near the location of a stellar overdensity , if it is associated with a dwarf galaxy with active star formation .",

    "we recognize that this interpretation is far from secure , but expect that future observations will be able to either confirm or refute the above hypothesis .",
    "the detection of such a small population of stars associated with this hi cloud is consistent with models for what one might detect in a low - mass dm system that is at the boundary between systems with and without significant amounts of cold baryons .",
    "for example , recent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations by @xcite of isolated dark matter halos with masses of 10@xmath103 - 10@xmath104 m@xmath105 result in galaxies with stellar masses of 10@xmath106 - 10@xmath107 m@xmath105 and large m@xmath108/m@xmath109 ratios .",

    "the first discovery of an optical counterpart associated with a bona fide uchvc was that of leo p @xcite , but leo  p is both substantially further away ( 1.73 mpc ) and larger ( m@xmath124 = @xmath69.4 , m@xmath125 = 9.3 @xmath56 10@xmath126 m@xmath127 ) than agc  198606 . while the properties of leo p are extreme ( e.g. , the lowest mass galaxy with current star formation , an abundance measurement consistent with the lowest metallicity systems known ) , agc  198606 is even more extreme .",
    "the optical characteristics of agc  198606 are more similar to those of the ufds discovered recently in the halo of the milky way ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "while possessing a more massive stellar population than the lowest mass ufds listed in table [ dgprops ] , the total stellar mass in agc  198606 is comparable to the ufds recently reported in the dark energy survey data @xcite .",
    "when compared to its near neighbor leo t , agc  198606 exhibits the rather discrepant characteristics of having somewhere between @xmath51% and @xmath56% of the optical luminosity of leo t but nearly double the hi mass .",
    "not surprisingly , agc  198606 has an extreme value for the hi gas to stellar mass ratio ( between 45 and 110 ) .",
    "the hi distributions in the galaxies are rather dissimilar as well . for leo t",
    ", the hi radius is 300 pc and the peak column density is measured to be @xmath128 atoms @xmath129 @xcite , while for agc  198606 the hi radius at the same column density level ( @xmath130 atoms @xmath129 ) is @xmath131 times as large ( 600 pc ) , the full hi extent is @xmath132 times larger ( @xmath133 pc ) , and the peak column density is a factor of @xmath61 lower ( @xmath134 atoms @xmath129 ) .",
    "we note that the beam sizes used for measuring the peak column densities for the two galaxies are similar ( @xmath135   for leo t and @xmath136   for agc  198606 ) but the hi extent of agc  198606 is measured using the low resolution ( @xmath137 ) data ; these mismatches should be taken into account when considering the numbers above .",
    "prior to the discovery of agc  198606 , leo t appeared to be fairly isolated in space @xcite . with a projected angular separation of 1.2@xmath138 ,",
    "the _ minimum _ physical separation of the pair is only 8.4 kpc ( adopting the average distance of the two galaxies of 400 kpc ) .",
    "hence , leo t and agc  198606 may be separated by only a modest number of hi radii ( @xmath56 @xmath56 r@xmath125 for agc  198606 ) .",
    "more than likely their current physical separation is larger , perhaps 30 - 40 kpc .",
    "however , given their similar distances and small velocity difference , it would seem plausible , even likely , that the two galaxies have had one or more close encounters in the past .",
    "it is tempting to associate the fairly recent episode of star formation in leo t ( @xmath5200 myr ago ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with such an encounter .",
    "the apparent lack of any obvious tidal hi bridging between the two galaxies in the alfalfa data @xcite would suggest that any such encounter was not a strong one .",
    "the presence of foreground galactic emission , however , limits the constraints that can be put on any connecting emission .",
    "it is even possible that leo  t or its `` friend '' has a tidal origin and originated from the other . given the more substantial stellar population associated with leo t , the more natural interpretation would be that such a tidal encounter with a third system might have pulled roughly two - thirds of the hi gas out of leo t to form agc  198606 .",
    "if so , then it would appear that any tidal model would need to be finely tuned to explain the observed system .",
    "that is , it is hard to imagine a tidal event that could remove more than half of the gas from such a low - mass system without disrupting the system entirely .",
    "the absence of an obvious perturber is another problem with this scenario , as is the lack of tidal hi mentioned above .",
    "we do not favor a tidal origin for agc  198606 , although such a scenario can not be ruled out .",
    "as mentioned above , the optical counterpart to agc  198606 is much more similar to the ufds than to the more gas - rich systems like leo t or leo p. it has been assumed that some ufds represent the remnant stellar populations of heavily stripped dwarf galaxies that were accreted by the mw @xcite .",
    "the existence of the extremely sparse stellar population in agc  198606 raises the possibility that the origin of these ufds may have been with substantially less massive systems than has been previously supposed .",
    "that is , ufds may have had progenitors that looked more like agc  198606 than more massive dwarf spheroidals . in this case , far less stripping would be required to account for the low stellar masses of some current ufds . while there is no reason to doubt the validity of the stripping scenario for the creation of some of the ufds , the existence of systems like agc  198606 provides another creation path for this class of objects .",
    "it seems clear that additional observational work is needed before any optical detection of a stellar component to agc  198606 can be considered secure .",
    "the sparse nature of the putative stellar population will make a definitive detection challenging .",
    "two logical steps forward would be ( 1 ) deeper ground - based imaging and ( 2 ) spectroscopy of the brighter rgb stars detected in our current data .",
    "our current podi images are already fairly deep and are of good image quality . at the location of the rgb in our cmd",
    "the podi data are 50% complete at @xmath58 .",
    "however , the location of the red clump at @xmath139 falls where both field contamination and increasing photometric errors combine to make a definitive detection of the red clump stars uncertain .",
    "deeper data with reduced photometric errors would help to improve this situation .",
    "radial velocity measurements of the handful of possible rgb stars in agc  198606 have the potential of confirming or rejecting their possible association with the hi gas .",
    "such observations were useful in the case of leo t @xcite and are well within the reach of current ground - based spectroscopic capabilities .    our group has obtained optical imaging data of similar depth for many additional uchvcs selected from the @xcite catalog and from subsequent searches of the alfalfa data by members of our team .",
    "initial visual searches of our current imaging data reveal no other optical counterparts as obvious as leo p. we are currently analyzing the data set using the automated method described here , with the expectation of either detecting additional sources similar to agc  198606 or setting upper limits on the mass of any stellar component that might be present .",
    "we have presented a processing and filtering technique designed to detect possible optical counterparts of ultra - compact high velocity hi clouds identified by the alfalfa survey .",
    "our filtering technique relies on constructing a region in color - magnitude space consistent with the theoretical and observational properties of other local group compact dwarf galaxies , which we then apply to the photometry of point sources in wiyn podi images in order to detect overdensities in the point source maps .",
    "this method provides an effective way to detect stellar overdensities given appropriately deep images . applying the technique to photometric observations of leo  p , a recently discovered star - forming dwarf galaxy",
    ", we recover an extremely significant overdensity in the image , implying that less obvious overdensities should also be detectable via our filtering and smoothing process .",
    "we find compelling evidence for the presence of a compact dwarf galaxy near the location of agc198606 , a uchvc in the vicinity of leo  t , the faintest dwarf galaxy in the local group with recent star formation and hi gas . our inferred properties for a potential dwarf galaxy give it a diameter of @xmath131 arcmin at a distance of @xmath140 kpc , only 42 kpc less distant than leo  t. an interesting candidate for follow - up study , the possible optical counterpart to the uchvc agc198606 is a good example of the capabilities of our processing and filtering methods .",
    "we are just beginning to apply the methods to the wiyn podi imaging data we have in hand and hope to report on additional detections , or at least to set limits on the stellar populations that may be associated with the alfalfa uchvc sources we have targeted .",
    "we are grateful to the staff at the wiyn observatory , kitt peak , and noao for their help during our various wiyn podi observing runs .",
