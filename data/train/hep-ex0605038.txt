    "i focus here on the recent cdf results on two - body @xmath8  decays into charmless , charged pseudo - scalar mesons or into muons .",
    "these results show how cdf program is becoming fully competitive with @xmath2-factories in untagged , time - independent analyses of @xmath0  meson decays into charged final states , and complementary to @xmath2-factories in analyses of @xmath1  modes .",
    "unless otherwise stated , -conjugate modes are implied throughout this paper , and branching - fractions ( @xmath9 ) indicate @xmath3-averages .",
    "in addition , the first uncertainty associated to any number is statistical , and the second one is systematic .",
    "the analyses presented here used data corresponding to time - integrated luminosities of @xmath10780 , collected by the upgraded collider detector ( cdf ii ) at the fermilab tevatron collider .",
    "the tevatron is a superconducting proton - synchrotron at the final stage of the fermilab accelerator complex . in run",
    "ii ( mid-2001present ) , it accelerates 36 bunches of protons against 36 bunches of anti - protons producing one crossing every 396 ns at @xmath11 tev . since the interaction region is about 30 cm long ( r.m.s . ) along the beam - line , a properly designed silicon micro - vertex detector is required to ensure good coverage for charged particles .",
    "the transverse beam - width at the collision point is about 2530 @xmath12 m ( r.m.s . ) , sufficiently small with respect to the typical transverse decay - length , with typical lorentz boost projected onto the plane perpendicular to the beam - line @xmath13 0.52 , and typical pseudo - proper decay - length of the @xmath14-hadron @xmath15 @xmath12 m . ] of @xmath14-hadrons , @xmath16 m , to allow separation of secondary from primary vertices .",
    "the instantaneous luminosity ( @xmath17 ) has been rising steadily during run ii up to the world record peak of @xmath18 , and regularly exceeds @xmath19 ; at such luminosities , two @xmath20@xmath21  interactions per bunch - crossing occur on average .",
    "the machine typically delivers data corresponding to @xmath22  per week , which are recorded with average data - taking efficiencies in excess of 85% at cdf . as of may 2006 ,",
    "the total luminosity gathered on tape is around 1.4 , of which approximately 1   was recorded with all crucial sub - detectors for flavor - physics operative .",
    "the cdf ii  detector is a 5000 t , multipurpose , solenoidal magnetic - spectrometer surrounded by @xmath23 calorimeters and muon detectors ; it is axially and azimuthally symmetric around the interaction point .",
    "its excellent tracking performance , good muon coverage , and particle identification ( pid ) capabilities allow a broad flavor - physics program .",
    "we briefly outline the sub - detectors pertinent to the analyses described here , additional details can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the cdf ii  tracking system consists of an inner silicon system surrounded by a cylindrical gas - wire drift chamber , both immersed in a 1.4 t solenoidal magnetic field with 135 cm total lever arm .",
    "six ( central region , @xmath24 ) to seven ( forward , @xmath25 ) double - sided silicon layers , plus one single - sided layer , extend radially from 1.6 to 22 cm ( 28 cm ) from the beam line in the central ( forward ) region , fully covering the luminous region .",
    "the chamber provides 96 ( 48 axial and 48 stereo ) samplings of charged - particle paths between 40 and 137 cm from the beam , and within @xmath26 .",
    "the long lever - arm of the tracker provides a superb mass - resolution : with @xmath27 , typical observed mass - widths are about 14  for @xmath28 decays , and about 9  for @xmath29  decays . in addition , silicon measurements close to the beam allow precise reconstruction of decay vertices , with typical resolutions of 30 @xmath12 m in the transverse plane and 70 @xmath12 m along the beam direction .",
    "four layers of planar drift chambers detect muon candidates with @xmath30  in the @xmath31 region , while conical sections of drift tubes extend the coverage to @xmath32 for muon candidates with @xmath33 .",
    "low - momentum pid is obtained with a scintillator - based time - of - flight detector with about 110 ps resolution , that provides @xmath34 separation between kaons and pions with @xmath35 .",
    "the information of specific energy - loss from the drift chamber ( @xmath36 ) complements the pid with 1.4@xmath37 nearly constant @xmath38 separation for higher - momentum charged particles ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "heavy - flavor phenomenology at the tevatron is different with respect to the @xmath40 environment .",
    "a large @xmath41 rate is exploited , which results in a production cross - section of about 30 @xmath12b @xcite for  within detector coverage , compared to 1 nb ( 7 nb ) @xmath42 cross - sections at the  ( @xmath43 ) resonances . unlike at the @xmath2-factories ,",
    "all species of   are produced at the tevatron , including @xmath1  and @xmath44  mesons , and .",
    "in addition , the dominant source of  is incoherent , strong production of @xmath45  pairs ; thus measurements that require flavor - tagging can be done by reconstructing a single  in the event , while at @xmath2-factories the flavor of one  is determined only after observing the decay of the other one .",
    "however , the @xmath20@xmath21  collider poses also several challenges . the large @xmath45  production cross - section is still only about 1/1000@xmath46 the total inelastic @xmath20@xmath21  cross - section .",
    "moreover , high ( @xmath47 30 ) track multiplicities per event are observed at the tevatron , owing to fragmentation of the hard - interaction products , to the underlying events ( i.  e. ,  hadronized remnants of @xmath20  and @xmath21 ) and to pile - up events ( multiple collisions per bunch crossing ) .",
    "in addition , the transverse momentum distribution of   is a rapidly falling function : most   have low-@xmath48  and decay into particles which are typically quite soft , often having @xmath49 ; thus , the need to select low-@xmath48  particles conflicts with the limited bandwidth allowed by the data acquisition systems ; furthermore , since the longitudinal component of   momenta is frequently large , their decay - products tend to be boosted along the beam line , thus escaping the detector acceptance .",
    "if one  is within cdf acceptance , the other one is within acceptance only @xmath50 of the time .",
    "the best way to identify @xmath14-flavor decays in such a challenging environment is to exploit their relatively long lifetime , which results in decay vertices separated by hundreds of microns from the @xmath20@xmath21  interaction , for hadrons with typical boosts . in this respect ,",
    "cdf excellent tracking plays a key role for an effective   reconstruction ; equally important is its highly - specialized and selective trigger , which uses silicon tracking information online and gathers large and pure samples of _ charmed _ and _ beauty _ decays while sustaining the high - rates associated with the @xmath20@xmath21  environment .",
    "cdf exploits its unique ability to trigger events with charged particles originated in vertices displaced from the primary @xmath20@xmath21  vertex ( displaced tracks ) @xcite .",
    "displaced tracks are identified by measuring with 35 @xmath12 m intrinsic resolution @xmath12 m determines the total impact parameter resolution , @xmath51 @xmath12 m . ] their impact parameter , which is the minimum distance between the particle direction and the primary @xmath20@xmath21  vertex in the plane transverse to the beam .",
    "such a high accuracy can be reached only using online the silicon information , a challenging task that requires to read - out 212,000 silicon channels and to complete hit - clustering and pattern recognition within the trigger latency . in a highly - parallelized architecture , fast pattern - matching and linearized track - fitting allow reconstruction of 2d - tracks in the plane transverse to the beam with offline - quality by combining drift - chamber and silicon information , within a typical latency of 25 @xmath12s per event .    using the above device",
    ", cdf implemented a trigger selection that requires only two displaced tracks in the event , to collect pure samples of exclusive non - leptonic @xmath14-decays for the first time in a hadron collider e.  g. ,  @xmath52and @xmath53 decays , in addition to large samples of semileptonic @xmath14-decays and of _ charmed _ meson decays .",
    "however , an impact - parameter based selection biases the decay - length distributions , reducing the statistical power in lifetime measurements . in section 3.2",
    "we discuss how the original lifetime information is deconvolved from the trigger efficiency , and from the smearing effects due to the finite resolution on the measured impact parameters and decay lengths .    besides the trigger on displaced tracks , past experience from run i suggests that triggering on final states containing single or dileptons is a successful strategy to select samples of  decays , because semileptonic ( @xmath54 ) and _ charmonium _",
    "( @xmath55x$ ] ) decays represent about 20% of  widths and have relatively clean experimental signatures .",
    "such a ` conventional ' approach was adapted to the upgraded detector : identification of muon down to low momenta allows for efficient dimuon triggers in which we select _ charmonium _ or rare decays and then we fully reconstruct several decay modes .",
    "on the other hand , semileptonic triggers require a displaced track in addition to the muon ( or electron ) , providing cleaner samples .",
    "the extraction of ckm parameters from measurements in  decays is often affected by large uncertainties , coming from non - perturbative qcd effects .",
    "one way to simplify the problem is to invoke flavor - symmetries under which the unknowns partially cancel . in this respect ,",
    "joint study of @xmath0  and @xmath1  two - body decays into charged kaons and pions ( @xmath56 ) plays a key role , since these modes are related by subgroups of the su(3 ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "cdf is the only experiment , to date , that has simultaneous access to these modes ; this provides a rich flavor - physics program : the analysis of first run ii data already lead to the first observation of @xmath5  decays , and to the world best limits on @xmath57  and @xmath58  decay rates @xcite ; now , with samples increased in size , cdf is approaching the opportunity to obtain competitive measurements of @xmath3-violating phases .",

    "their interfering amplitudes induce the @xmath3  asymmetry @xmath59  defined as follows : @xmath60 which is sensitive to the @xmath61  ckm phase ( angle @xmath62 ) and to the difference @xmath63 between strong phases of the two amplitudes .",
    "@xmath2-factories recently measured a @xmath50 asymmetry with 2% accuracy , probing for the first time direct @xmath3  violation in the  sector @xcite ; however , additional experimental information is needed because theoretical predictions still suffer from large ( 510% ) uncertainties @xcite , and the observed asymmetries in neutral and charged modes are not consistent , as the sm would suggest .",
    "a measurement from the tevatron is therefore interesting , also for the unique possibility to combine asymmetry measurements in @xmath4  and @xmath57  decays , which provide a model - independent probe for the presence of non - sm physics @xcite .",
    "we analyzed a @xmath10  sample of pairs of oppositely - charged particles , used to form  candidates , with @xmath64  and @xmath65 .",
    "the trigger required also a transverse opening - angle between tracks @xmath66 to reject background from particles within light - quark jets .",
    "in addition , both charged particles were required to originate in a displaced vertex ( 100 @xmath12 m @xmath67 mm ) , while the  candidate was required to be produced in the primary @xmath20@xmath21  interaction ( @xmath68 @xmath12 m ) and to have travelled a transverse distance @xmath69 @xmath12 m .",
