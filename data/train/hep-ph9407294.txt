    "are : spontaneous @xmath0 violation @xcite , incorporation of the peccei - quinn symmetry @xcite to solve the strong @xmath0 problem , and incorporation of supersymmetry .    at the one - loop level",
    ", cubic coupling obviously comes from triangle diagrams .",
    "if the internal lines are fermions , no @xmath0 violating effect is generated at the one - loop level , because the @xmath11 or photon couplings with fermions are flavor diagonal and @xmath0 conserving .",

    "thooft gauge , it can be shown that they do not contribute to the form factors as shown in eq .",

    "this term has been shown to be non - zero for @xmath79 coupling at the one - loop level for the model at hand @xcite .",
    "we want to extend their calculation for the case of @xmath80 couplings , where @xmath81 can be either an off - shell @xmath11-boson or photon , and the other two @xmath11-bosons are assumed to be on - shell .    to set up the notation , we call the two higgs multiplets to be @xmath82 and @xmath83 . usually , they are assumed to have special transformation properties with respect to some discrete symmetries in order to avoid flavor changing neutral currents at the tree level .",
    "we assume that such discrete symmetries are not imposed on the soft terms in the higgs potential , otherwise @xmath0 violation would be eliminated in the higgs sector of the model . without any loss of generality , we can take the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of @xmath82 and @xmath83 to be @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "one can then define a linear combination @xmath86 of the two multiplets which has a vev @xmath87 , and the orthogonal one , @xmath88 , has a vanishing vev .",
    "the components of these doublets can then be written as @xmath89 the fields shown here are complex combinations of the fields in the @xmath82-@xmath83 basis .",
    "the components @xmath90 and @xmath41 are eaten up by the gauge bosons and disappear from the physical spectrum .",
    "there are four physical spinless bosons in the model .",
    "one of them is the complex field @xmath91 .",
    "the other three are , in general , superpositions of the fields @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "we define the eigenstates by @xmath95 , where @xmath96 @xmath97 being an orthogonal mixing matrix .    the coupling of these neutral higgs bosons with the @xmath11-boson looks very simple in the @xmath38-basis : @xmath98 using eq .",
    "( [ phi = oh ] ) , it is trivial to rewrite these feynman rules in terms of the mass eigenstates of neutral higgs bosons : @xmath99 using the orthogonality of the mixing matrix @xmath97 , we can write @xmath100 which simplifies the form of the @xmath11-coupling with two physical higgs bosons .",
    "notice that the @xmath11-coupling between two physical higgs bosons is necessarily flavor - changing , which opens up the possibility for @xmath0 violation at one - loop level .",
    "for the reason that the photon field preserves flavors at the tree level , there is no @xmath101 form factor at the one - loop calculation in the two higgs model .",
    "these cubic couplings appear in the triangle diagrams shown in fig",

    "a straightforward calculation now shows that the form - factor @xmath71 from these diagrams can be written in the form @xmath104 here , @xmath105 is a factor coming from vertices which will be discussed below , and the loop integral @xmath106 is equal to : @xmath107 where the positive feynman parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 are restricted within the integration domain @xmath108 and also @xmath109 .",
    "@xmath110 is a cut - off which disappears in the expression for @xmath71 , as we will show below .",
    "when one of the particles denoted by @xmath111 , @xmath112 or @xmath113 is the unphysical higgs boson , the corresponding mass should be interpreted to be @xmath114 , because the propagator of the unphysical higgs boson has a pole for this value of mass in the gauge we use . for future purposes ,",

    "( [ i ] ) .",
    "let us now discuss the factor @xmath105 .",

    "( [ hhz ] ) , all the higgs bosons in the loop must be different . if , following the direction of the momentum arrow in fig .  2 , we encounter the mass eigenstates @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 in that order , it is easy to see that the factor coming from the vertices is @xmath120 obviously , there are three such diagrams , and their total contribution is @xmath121 on the other hand , if we encounter the eigenstates in the reverse order , we obtain a factor @xmath122 from the vertices",
    ". however , this term will be multiplied by @xmath123 by virtue of eq .",
    "( [ i - i ] ) , the product of the two is the same as the contribution of eq .",
    "( [ abccontrib ] ) .",
    "next we consider diagrams where one of the internal lines is the unphysical neutral higgs boson @xmath41 .",
    "note that since there is no coupling of the @xmath11-boson with two unphysical higgs bosons , at most one internal line can be the unphysical higgs boson . in this case",
    ", one can derive that @xmath124 and the same value for any even permutation of subscripts , but opposite sign for an odd permutation .",
    "therefore , the last factor of summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f4 ] ) becomes @xmath125 one can see that the cutoff @xmath110 dependence is cancelled by pairs in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ilist ] ) .",
    "we also note that @xmath71 remains finite when @xmath126 as noted in ref.@xcite .",
    "3 shows the extremely tiny size ( @xmath127 ) of @xmath71 for typical choices of parameters .",
    "we only use this two higgs model as an illustration how @xmath0 violation occurs even in a purely bosonic sector .",
    "at lep ii , the @xmath128 production cross - section is about 1 pb ( see fig .",
    "4 ) for @xmath129 gev which can provide about @xmath130 @xmath128 pairs per year for the design luminosity of @xmath131 @xmath132 s@xmath133 . as we have shown in the paper",
