    "a long - standing problem in the physics of solar flares concerns the `` bulk energization '' or `` first phase acceleration '' of electrons . these electrons produce the characteristic observational features of the impulsive phase of a flare :",
    "hard x - ray bursts from footpoints of the flaring flux loops , and type  iii radio bursts @xcite . despite an extensive literature over many decades",
    ", no model has emerged that can account in a self - consistent way for important features inferred from observations .",
    "we summarize the difficulties in terms of three problems .",
    "the first problem is the enormous energy channeled through these electrons : essentially all the energy in a non - eruptive flare and all the nonthermal energy in an eruptive flare go into electrons with kinetic energies @xmath2kev .",
    "the power transferred to these electrons can be written as @xmath3 , with the current @xmath4 of order @xmath5a identified from vector magnetograph data , and one then requires a potential @xmath6 of order @xmath7v . a simple estimate of the rate of change of the magnetic flux stored in the corona leads to a value of this order , but there is no direct evidence for such a large potential in the corona .",
    "the energy @xmath8 of the accelerated electrons is of order @xmath9ev , and if this is identified as @xmath10 times a potential , the potential is of order @xmath11v .",
    "the problem is the inconsistency between the potential @xmath12v required by the electrodynamics , and the potential seemingly available for acceleration , which is @xmath13 , with @xmath14 of order @xmath15 .",
    "the second problem is the `` number problem '' @xcite which can be expressed in several ways .",
    "one manifestation is that the number of electrons accelerated greatly exceeds the number of electrons in the flaring flux tube prior to the flare .",
    "this requires that the electrons be resupplied continuously by a return current @xcite .",
    "the number problem can also be expressed in terms of the rate electrons precipitate , implied by a thick - target - bremsstrahlung model for hard x - ray bursts .",
    "this rate @xmath16 exceeds @xmath17 by the same multiplicity factor @xmath14 of order @xmath15 .",
    "the third problem is that the acceleration mechanism must account for energization of all the electrons in a given volume , not just once but many times as the electrons are continuously resupplied , accelerated , and escape .",
    "acceleration by shocks can lead to a form of bulk energization , but there is no evidence that the nonthermal energy in flares goes primarily into shocks .",
    "acceleration by a parallel electric field @xmath18 seems the only viable bulk - energization mechanism .",
    "discussion of such acceleration in the older literature concentrated on the runaway effect , where effectively all the electrons experience runaway acceleration for @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the dreicer field . in the more recent literature , influenced by analogous problems that occur in the acceleration of auroral electrons in the earth s magnetosphere ,",
    "the energy transport into the acceleration region is assumed to be by alfvn waves , and @xmath21 is assumed to arise from dispersive effects associated with small - scale structures in these waves .",
    "this is the starting point for the discussion in the present article .    in the alfvn - wave model that we adopt ( , @xcite , )",
    ", the magnetic energy is stored in current - carrying loops in the corona prior to the flare .",
    "magnetic reconnection allows transfer of magnetic flux and current to new magnetic loops , leading to a net reduction in the stored magnetic energy .",
    "the magnetic energy flows into a reconnection region where it is converted into an outflowing alfvnic flux that transports the energy downward to an acceleration region near the chromosphere @xcite . in our version of this model @xcite ,",
    "the alfvnic flux involves transport of energy and potential , with the latter described by the cross - field potential @xmath22 in a downgoing wave .",
    "the wave is assumed to damp in the acceleration region , transferring energy to accelerated electrons .",
    "an earlier attempt to model this acceleration on a macroscopic scale , in terms of a downward poynting flux in the wave converting to a kinetic - energy flux in the accelerated electrons , led to an inconsistency @xcite . although our starting assumption was a slow variation across field lines , the model leads to structure across field lines on a very small scale , determined by the skin depth @xmath23 .",
    "this result further emphasizes the need for very small perpendicular scales for effective damping of alfvn waves , as is widely recognized , both in connection with auroral acceleration ( , , , , , @xcite , , ) and in connection with solar flares @xcite .",
    "dispersive effects lead to alfvn waves having @xmath21 , and the suggestion is that this @xmath18 allows the required energy transfer from waves to particles . however , there is no consensus on the details of this mechanism .",
    "an older suggestion @xcite is that a turbulent cascade transfers the energy to small scales where fermi acceleration transfers this energy to the electrons @xcite .",
    "more recent suggestions @xcite are that the small scales result in inertial alfvn waves ( iaws ) , or in kinetic alfvn waves ( kaws ) , that are damped due to electrons being accelerated by @xmath18 in the wave .    in this article",
    "we explore a different approach to energy transfer from alfvn waves to electrons . any effective dissipation in a collisionless plasma , such as the solar corona , must involve some form of anomalous resistivity @xcite .",
    "anomalous resistivity involves a current - driven plasma instability .",
    "when the parallel current density @xmath24 exceeds an appropriate threshold @xmath25 relevant waves grow , and the anomalous dissipation is due to the energy going into these waves being transferred to electrons , which damp them .",
    "we assume that such anomalous dissipation is the mechanism by which the energy in alfvn waves is transferred to the electrons .",
    "the electric field @xmath21 can be described in terms of the associated parallel potential @xmath26 , and we argue that this has a maximum ( @xmath27 ) that implies a maximum energy @xmath28 to which electrons can be accelerated .",
    "however , we do not attribute the acceleration of electrons to @xmath21 in the waves .",
    "we assume that within the acceleration region , the accelerating electric field is determined by an ohm s law ( @xmath29 ) that involves the anomalous resistivity ( @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the anomalous conductivity ) .",
    "we show that this model provides a natural explanation for the acceleration of the bulk of the electrons to a typical energy of tens of kev .    in section  [ s :",
    "alfven ] we present a model for iaws involving both a cross - field and a parallel potential . in section  [ s : max ] we show that there is a maximum parallel potential in the waves , determined by the threshold for exciting anomalous resistivity through a current - driven instability , and we argue that the maximum parallel potential is of order that required to account for bulk energization when the threshold corresponds to the buneman instability . in section  [",

    "we discuss our results in section  [ s : discussion ] and summarize our conclusions in section  [ s : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we first comment on dispersive , inertial , and kinetic alfvn waves . we then extend a treatment of large - amplitude alfvn waves @xcite in terms of the wave potential @xmath6 to include the parallel potential @xmath26 in the waves .",
    "alfvn waves in the approximation @xmath32 are nondispersive , and when @xmath21 is included they are referred to as dispersive alfvn waves ( daws ) .",
    "two limiting cases of daws are inertial alfvn waves ( iaws ) and kinetic alfvn waves ( kaws ) @xcite .",

    "follows when the electrons are assumed cold ( @xmath41 ) and equation ( [ kaw ] ) follows when the opposite approximation ( @xmath42 ) is made for the electrons .",

    "does landau damping allow acceleration of thermal electrons , with @xmath51 , as required for bulk energization .",

    "the parallel potential in the iaw is proportional to the parallel current density , which varies across the field lines .",
    "effective energy transport occurs when the direct current is strongly concentrated in a small central region , surrounded by a larger region with a weaker return current @xcite .",
    "it follows from equation ( [ jpar4 ] ) that the parallel potential has a similar profile , being large in the small central region of direct current , and smaller and of the opposite sign in the surrounding region of return current .",
    "the maximum parallel potential @xmath27 is determined by the maximum current density , which is in the small central region of direct current .",

    "the parallel current density and parallel potential in downward alfvn waves may be written in the form = ^+_max -_c^2_^2^+_max , [ thresh ] where equation ( [ iaw4 ] ) is used in the approximate relation .",
    "instability develops along the current path when the ratio given by equation ( [ thresh ] ) exceeds unity . introducing a perpendicular scale length @xmath86 by @xmath87 , this favors regions where @xmath88 is largest .",
    "we apply equation ( [ emax ] ) to the buneman instability ( , @xcite ) , which has a threshold @xmath89 .",
    "the buneman instability is reactive , in the sense that the wave growth involves a complex solution of a real dispersion equation @xcite .",
    "the reactive nature applies only when the electrons can be regarded as cold , and this applies only if the electrons have a drift velocity that exceeds their thermal spread , of order @xmath84 .",
    "the backreaction to the development of buneman instability tends both to reduce the drift speed and to increase the thermal spread .",
    "this increase in thermal spread corresponds to a bulk energization , that is , it corresponds to an increase in @xmath90 .",
    "this heating effect is well known in the context of anomalous resistivity @xcite , where the buneman instability is invoked to provide the electron heating ( to @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the ion temperature ) required for the ion - acoustic instability to develop , or for double layers to form .",
    "the maximum energy implied by equation ( [ emax ] ) with @xmath93 in an iaw , and with @xmath94 for the buneman instability , can plausibly account for the electron energies inferred in bulk energization .",
    "equation ( [ emax ] ) then implies that @xmath62 exceeds the thermal energy @xmath90 by a factor of order @xmath95 , which is of order 10 .",
    "the existence of this maximum is more important than its actual value , which is subject to uncertainties associated with the values of both @xmath90 and @xmath37 . both @xmath90 and @xmath37",
    "are affected by the acceleration , with @xmath90 increasing as a result of bulk energization , and @xmath37 increasing due to the formation of a density cavity , as discussed below .",
    "the bulk energization mechanism we propose here involves energy being transported into the acceleration region by a large - amplitude alfvn wave and dissipated in a current sheet .",
    "the concentration of current ( into sheets ) is required for sufficient energy to be transported @xcite .",
    "the buneman instability is assumed to develop within the sheets and produce anomalous resistivity .",
    "we refer to such regions as ltacrs .",
    "we discuss three aspects of the acceleration within ltacrs : the role of anomalous resistivity , energy flow into individual ltacrs , and the number of ltacrs required to be accelerating electrons at any given time .",
    "the parallel electric field in an iaw does not lead automatically to energy dissipation and associated electron acceleration . in a homogeneous medium , an iaw with given",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 has a non - zero @xmath18 that oscillates in time and space , and is associated with periodic recycling of energy within the wave .",
    "electron - ion collisions lead to dissipation , due to the energy associated with the forced motion of an electron in the wave being lost when it is randomized during a collision .",
    "this effect may be modeled by the drag term in the equation of motion [ equation ( [ iaw1 ] ) ] , with @xmath56 then identified as the collision frequency .",
    "this dissipation may be described in terms of a resistivity @xmath96 or a conductivity _ an=_0_p^2_eff .",
    "[ an1 ] the simplest model for anomalous resistivity or conductivity involves interpreting @xmath56 as an effective collision frequency that is very much greater than the electron - ion collision frequency .",
    "the inclusion of dissipation , through the anomalous conductivity , implies that the electric field has both reactive ( time - reversible ) and dissipative ( time - irreversible ) parts .",
    "for example , when the response of the plasma is described in terms of the equivalent dielectric tensor , these parts of the response are due to the hermitian and anti - hermitian parts of the tensor , respectively . in the case of weak dissipation",
    "these two parts are independent of , and proportional to @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "any dissipation causes the amplitude of the wave to decrease , with the energy lost by the wave transferred ( irreversibly ) to the particles . in the long - wavelength limit the dissipative response of",
    "the plasma leads to a quasi - static @xmath21 . here",
    ", we attribute the acceleration of the particles to the quasi - static @xmath21 in the anomalously conducting region .",
    "we assume that the parallel electric field that is important in the dissipation of the alfvn waves results from the current density and the anomalous resistivity : e_=j__an=_effj__0_p^2 .",
    "[ an2 ] further assuming that the current density is at the threshold of instability , equation ( [ an2 ] ) determines @xmath18 within a ltacr .",
    "let the ltacr be of length @xmath97 along the field lines , where @xmath97 may be the length of a single region or the sum of the length of several regions .",

    "is accelerated to @xmath100 , given by equation ( [ emax ] ) , before escaping from the region .",
    "dissipation is confined to individual ltacrs , and energy must flow into a ltacr in order to be dissipated .",
    "we discuss three contributions to this energy inflow : energy flow along field lies , energy flow across field lines , and motion of ltacrs across field lines .",
    "the energy flux in an alfvn wave is given by the poynting vector @xmath101 .",
    "in the non - dispersive limit the energy flux is parallel to the ( background ) magnetic field ; @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "one contribution to the energy flow into a ltacr is from @xmath104 along the field lines that pass through the ltacr .",
    "although @xmath104 has maxima near the edges of the ltacr , much of the poynting flux @xmath104 flows along field lines that do not enter the ltacr through its top .",
    "effective dissipation requires that all the energy flows into the dissipation region .",
    "we identify two ways in which energy can flow sideways into a ltacr .",
    "when @xmath105 is taken into account in the iaw , the poynting vector has a component across the field lines , with @xmath106 . with @xmath107",
    "the energy flux in the alfvn waves can flow into a ltacr through one side .    in the discussion",
    "so far we neglect the fact that the presence of @xmath21 implies that the frozen - in condition is not valid . at the top of the acceleration region ,",
    "plasma moves with velocity @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the background magnetic field .",
    "the velocity @xmath110 reduces to zero at the bottom of the acceleration region .",
    "this may be attributed to the slippage of plasma relative to field lines , and it can be modeled by assuming that the ltacrs are aligned at a slightly oblique angle to the vertical @xcite . this model allows a vertically downward energy flux to enter a ltacr through its side . in section  [",
    "sect : stat ] we describe a `` picket - fence '' model @xcite with a slant ( along the @xmath65-axis ) of the pickets containing the ltacrs .",
    "a strictly downward energy flux necessarily encounters a dissipation region if the slope is such that the top of one ( slanted ) dissipation region lies vertically above the bottom of the neighboring dissipation region .",

    "we assume that the power inflow is p_in= a_an_c^2__effv_ar_aj_max^2 , [ an4 ] where @xmath111 is the surface area over which the current flows into the ltacr . in a planar model of a ltacr ,",

    "we assume that the current loop involves field - aligned currents to and from a conducting boundary , as proposed by in a laboratory context . a plausible region where cross - field current closure is possible is the partially - ionized region ( near the photosphere ) , where a pedersen current can flow .",

    "the number problem can be quantified by the requirement that the ( nonthermal ) power @xmath3 in a flare appears in electrons accelerated at a rate @xmath129 with energy @xmath130 , with @xmath131 for the fiducial numbers @xmath132a and @xmath133v adopted here . any acceptable resolution of the number problem requires an explanation for the multiplicity @xmath14 . following a suggestion by , we proposed the picket - fence model @xcite , in which the current @xmath4 flows up and down @xmath14 times between the generator and acceleration regions .",
    "an important additional feature that we include here is the existence of @xmath27 , which is given by equation ( [ emax ] ) , and which is plausibly of order @xmath11v , allowing it to be equated to @xmath134 .",
    "this provides a way of explaining @xmath14 , as the ratio @xmath135 of the emf generated by the changing magnetic field on a global scale , to the maximum parallel potential that the microphysics allows locally in the acceleration region .",
    "another aspect of the link between these two scales concerns @xmath24 .",
    "the global electrodymanics requires that the alfvn waves transport a large power , and the power is maximized by having the direct @xmath24 concentrated in a very narrow channel surrounded by a much larger region of weaker return current @xcite .",
    "the microphysics requires that , for anomalous resistivity to develop , @xmath24 must exceed the threshold for a current - driven instability .",
    "this effect is already included in the model , through @xmath136 in the iaw allowing @xmath80 to determine @xmath27 .",
    "we assume that prior to a flare the stressed magnetic field is unable to relax , and that the trigger for a flare is the turning on of anomalous dissipation .",
    "this causes the frozen - in condition to break down , allowing the magnetic field to slip relative to the plasma and allowing the magnetic field on a global scale to start to change .",
    "the changing magnetic field implies @xmath137 , which acts as the emf that drives the current @xmath4 across field lines in the generator region .",
    "the cross - field @xmath4 and @xmath6 launch an alfvn wave that sets up a current loop that redirects @xmath4 along field lines through the dissipation region , where the energy is dissipated .",
    "the restriction of the parallel potential to @xmath27 in the dissipation region implies that the rate of change of magnetic flux on the global scale is restricted to a value @xmath138 .",
    "the now unbalanced magnetic stress drives the changes faster , and this can be achieved only by the current being redirected through the dissipation region multiple times .",
    "this results in the proposed picket - fence model , in which the current is redirected up and down @xmath14 times , allowing the rate of change of magnetic flux to increase to @xmath139 .    in this model , there is a resistance @xmath121 , given by equation ( [ an6 ] ) , associated with each section of the current path through the dissipation region .",
    "these resistances are in series along the current path , so that the total resistance is @xmath140 . with our fiducial numbers ,",
    "the total effective resistance is equal to @xmath141 . using equations ( [ an6 ] ) and ( [ an3 ] ) , this leads to a relation between the global electrodynamics and the properties of the ltacrs on the micro - scale : m = a_an_c^2ir_ai_max^2 = a_an_c^2i^2i_max^2r_ai .",
    "[ npa ] assuming @xmath142 , which implies @xmath143ohm , and also assuming @xmath144 , our fiducial numbers require @xmath145 of order @xmath146 .",
    "thus we find that the global requirements can be met by the microphysics , in a model based on many ltacrs , provided that the area associated with each ltacr is of order @xmath147 .",

    "the figure on the right indicates the direction of the parallel electric field and the energy flow in the iaw at the surface of a ltacr .",
    "the sheets are shown slanted to take account of the slippage of plasma relative to magnetic field . ]",
    "a simplifying feature of a model for anomalous dissipation based on a large number of ltacrs is that the macroscopic effects of the dissipation depend on the distribution of ltacrs , and are relatively insensitive to the detailed properties of individual ltacrs .",
    "we suggest a model in which the ltacrs are idealized as current sheets that extend across the flaring flux tube in one direction ( the @xmath66-axis ) and correspond to the picket - fence structure in the other direction ( the @xmath65-axis ) .",
    "this model is illustrated in figure  [ fig : mw2 ] , which shows three of the @xmath14 sheets along the @xmath65-axis , each of which includes four ltacrs . the maximum current density @xmath78 is confined to sheets of length @xmath148 and thickness @xmath112 , separated by regions of return current of thickness @xmath149 .",
    "the model is not sensitive to the distribution of anomalous conductivity either along the field lines or along the @xmath66-axis . along the field lines , any number of ltacrs with a net length @xmath97 is equivalent to a single ltacr of length @xmath97 .",
    "the distribution of ltacrs along the @xmath65-axis is highly structured .",
    "there are @xmath14 current sheets and the ltacrs are confined to these sheets .",
    "the direct current flows within these sheets , which have only a small filling factor along the @xmath65-axis , with the much larger regions between the sheets carrying the much weaker return current .",
    "the current sheets illustrated in figure  [ fig : mw2 ] are shown with an ( exaggerated ) slant .",
    "a slant results from the slippage of the plasma relative to the magnetic field @xcite , and is one of the mechanisms ( discussed in section  [ sect : energy_flow ] ) that allows all the downward energy flux to encounter a ltacr where the energy is dissipated .",
    "the panel on the right in figure  [ fig : mw2 ] indicates how both the slant and the horizontal component of the poynting flux can result in the downward energy flux entering a ltacr through its side .",
    "an important parameter in this model is the area @xmath116 of a ltacr , which also determines the filling factor of the regions with @xmath78 along the @xmath65-axis .",
    "this area @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the width of the flux tube , is related to the multiplicity @xmath14 through equation ( [ an6 ] ) . for our model to account quantitatively for bulk energization we require @xmath152 . to see how this can be achieved , first note that to achieve the maximum parallel potential in an iaw requires @xmath153 , which corresponds to @xmath154 . with @xmath155 of order @xmath156 m",
    ", one has @xmath157 for @xmath23 of order @xmath158 m corresponding to an electron density @xmath159 . with these numbers ,",
    "the filling factor of the regions with @xmath160 is of order @xmath161 .",
    "a self - consistency check on the model is given by estimating the total rate electrons are accelerated .",
    "we assume that electrons are accelerated to a speed @xmath162 before they escape from an individual ltacr .",
    "the rate electrons escape from a ltacr is then _",
    "c=(n_e_c^2c)a_an_c^2v_escc , n_e_c^2c=0.910 ^ 22s^-1 .",
    "[ mult2 ] with @xmath163 and @xmath164 , a total of @xmath146 such ltacrs would give @xmath165 , consistent with what is required .",
    "these estimates are subject to uncertainty and flexibility , associated with the location of the acceleration region relative to the chromosphere , and hence to the electron density @xmath58 , the skin depth ( @xmath166 ) , and the length @xmath151 across the flux tube .",
    "subject to these provisos , it appears that the model can account semi - quantitatively for the parameters @xmath167 and @xmath168ev involved in bulk energization .",
    "we comment on four points related to out model : the acceleration mechanism , the return current , current concentration , and density depletions and enhancements .",
    "the acceleration mechanism proposed here depends explicitly on the development of anomalous resistivity .",
    "we identify the accelerating electric field as @xmath169 , with @xmath24 set equal to the threshold current density for the buneman instability , and with the anomalous conductivity identified as @xmath170 .",
    "the model requires that the effective collision frequency and the length of the anomalously conducting region ( @xmath171 ) be related by @xmath172 @xcite . in other proposed mechanisms ,",
    "acceleration is attributed to the electric field @xmath18 associated directly with the alfvn wave . the mechanism assumed by",
    "depends explicitly on the iaws being pulsed , with the parallel potential causing reflection of some electrons as the pulse passes . the mechanism assumed by involves @xmath18 in kaws rather than iaws .",
    "fermi acceleration , as suggested by , is related to landau damping of magnetoacoustic waves @xcite , so that this model requires that the turbulent cascade produce a magnetoacoustic component before it can accelerate electrons @xcite .",
    "the acceleration mechanism we propose is confined to ltacrs . within a ltacr ,",
    "the parallel potential is that implied by ohm s law , and the energy inflow into a ltacr occurs both along and across field lines .",
    "the electric field @xmath173 in the wave is essential for the cross - field inflow , and @xmath122 in the wave determines the maximum parallel potential available along a ltacr .    the statistically large number ( @xmath146 ) of ltacrs required leads to a simplification , due to the model depending more on the statistical distribution of ltacrs than on the ( poorly - determined ) detailed properties of individual ltacrs .",
    "we suggest a statistical model in which each ltacr is a current sheet of thickness ( along the @xmath65-axis ) of order a skin depth and extends across the flux tube ( along the @xmath66-axis ) .",
    "in such a model , a weaker return current flows in the regions between the current sheets , and resupplies electrons to the acceleration region at the rate accelerated electrons escape from this region .",
    "an essential requirement of our model is a mechanism that concentrates the current into regions of very high local current density .",
    "possible mechanisms were discussed inconclusively by , and we do not repeat his arguments here .",
    "we note the confinement of alfvn waves to small - scale current threads has been assumed in a possible explanation for coronal heating @xcite . in our model @xcite",
    "there is an unrelated requirement for current concentration : the power transported by the alfvn waves increases as the current associated with the wave increases . assuming that the power release is driven towards a maximum , this necessarily involves the current becoming strongly concentrated , and favors any mechanism that tends to increase the current density in the resulting current sheets .",
    "we note a general feature of the model whose implications require further investigation : the current flow necessarily results in density depletions and enhancements .",
    "this results from the properties of the current loops : electrons carry the current along field lines , and ions carry the ( polarization ) current across field lines . in any region where an upgoing current connects to a cross - field current",
    "there is a net outflow of particles , and in any region where a downgoing current connects to a cross - field current there is a net inflow of particles .",
    "regions of charge depletion , referred to as cavities , are a notable feature of the auroral ( upward - current ) acceleration region ( , @xcite ) .",
    "such current - driven depletions and enhancements are likely to play a significant role in a more detailed model , but we do not discuss these effects further here .",
    "the ideas discussed in this article indicate how the long - standing number problem @xcite might be solved . a new idea that we introduce",
    "is that the microphysics that determines the dissipation of the alfvn waves by acceleration of electrons also constrains the global electrodynamics .",
    "specifically , we show that there is a maximum parallel potential @xmath27 , determined by the properties of iaws together with the maximum current density that can flow without exciting anomalous resistivity .",
    "we argue that the existence of @xmath27 plays two important roles in the model .",
    "first , it determines the maximum energy ( @xmath61 ) to which electrons are accelerated .",
    "second , it restricts the perpendicular potential @xmath22 in the alfvn wave to less than about @xmath27 .",
    "we argue that this forces the system to drive the cross - field current @xmath4 in the generator region to flow up and down along field lines multiple ( @xmath14 ) times in order to achieve the required dissipation .",
    "each alfvn wave transports a potential @xmath134 and involves a current @xmath4 confined to a thin current sheet , with the return current flowing in the regions between the sheets .",
    "the development of anomalous resistivity plays an essential role .",
    "we assume that bulk energization of electrons occurs in local , transient , anomalously - conducting regions ( ltacrs ) .",
    "the strong concentration of current into narrow channels , required to account for the energy transport by alfvn waves , is assumed to exceed the threshold for the buneman instability , leading to anomalous resistivity .",
    "the energy transported downward by the alfvn wave flows into ltacrs in the acceleration region both along and across field lines , with the latter allowed due to @xmath21 in iaws .",
    "we propose an idealized model in which the direct current is confined to sheets several skin depths in thickness , separated by regions of return current .",
    "the model can account semi - quantitatively for the inferred bulk energization .",
    "our results are sufficiently encouraging to warrant a more detailed model .",
    "we thank neil cramer for helpful advice on dispersive alfvn waves .",
    "in kinetic theory , the response of the electrons is described in terms of the plasma dispersion function with an argument @xmath174 .",
    "the cold - electron limit corresponds to @xmath175 .",
    "the parallel component of the dielectric tensor then reduces to the cold - plasma form @xmath176 , and this cold - plasma response leads to equation ( [ iaw4 ] ) . in the opposite limit ( @xmath177 )",
    "one has k_zz=1-_pi^2 ^ 2 + 1k_z^2_de^2 , [ kaw1 ] where the ions are assumed cold , @xmath178 is the ion plasma frequency , and @xmath179 is the electron debye length .",
    "the final term in equation ( [ kaw1 ] ) corresponds to a quasi - static , one - dimensional screening , satisfying @xmath180 for any extraneous charge density @xmath181 . making the replacements @xmath182 and @xmath183 ,",
    "in place of equation ( [ iaw3 ] ) one finds -1_de^2 1c^2 ^ 2t^2 + 1v_0 ^ 2 ^ 2t^2 _ ^2=0 .",
    "[ kaw2 ] neglecting the first term in equation ( [ kaw2 ] ) gives = r_g^2_^2 , r_g^2=_de^2c^2v_0 ^ 2=_c^2v_e^2v_0 ^ 2 .",
    "[ kaw3 ] combining equations ( [ we1 ] ) and ( [ kaw3 ] ) one obtains the wave equation for kaws in a form analogous to equation ( [ iaw5 ] ) : (    c +    ) = 0 .",
    "[ kaw4 ] after fourier transforming , equations ( [ 2pot ] ) , ( [ kaw3 ] ) , and ( [ kaw4 ] ) imply the wave properties in equation ( [ kaw ] ) .",
    "the requirement @xmath184 renders kaws of little interest in the present context .",
    "more detailed treatments of kaws are available @xcite .",
    "in particular , the value of the parameter @xmath40 in equation ( [ kaw ] ) derived by is @xcite r_g^2=v_i^2_i^2(34+t_et_i ) , [ rg ] where @xmath185 and @xmath186 are the thermal speed and gyrofrequency , respectively , of ions of mass @xmath187 and charge @xmath188 .",
