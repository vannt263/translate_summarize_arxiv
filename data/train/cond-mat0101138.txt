    "a still relatively little explored area of research in non - equilibrium superconductivity concerns phenomena involving spin - polarized quasiparticles .",
    "pioneering work on spin - polarized tunneling in conventional s - wave superconductors was performed by meservey and tedrow @xcite , who studied different ferromagnets ( f ) in f / al@xmath10o@xmath11al tunnel junctions and found that the tunnel current can show varying degrees of spin polarization .",
    "more recently , experiments were performed by different groups in order to establish whether superconductivity can be suppressed by injecting spin - polarized quasiparticles @xcite . in these cases",
    "the combinations existed of a d - wave high - t@xmath12 superconductor ( xba@xmath10cu@xmath11o@xmath13 , with x = y , dy ) and a fully spin - polarized ferromagnetic manganite ( a@xmath14b@xmath15mno@xmath11 with a = la , nd and b = ca , sr ) , either with or without a barrier of a different oxide ; measured was the change in the zero - field critical current density @xmath3 of the superconducting films upon applying a current bias through the ferromagnet .",
    "the results are not fully conclusive , and certainly not quantitative .",
    "although generally a suppression of @xmath3 was observed , heating effects could not always be fully ruled out since the manganites are highly resistive metals ( see the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and the geometry did not always allow to determine the area of the current injection , and therefore the injected current density . moreover , since @xmath3 in high t@xmath12 superconductors generally is not the depairing current @xmath0 but involves flux motion , @xmath3 is not a direct measure for the amount of depression of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "similar experiments have to our knowledge not been performed with combinations of conventional metals , although that would have some clear advantages .",
    "the interpretation of results would not be complicated by e.g. inhomogeneous currents in the ferromagnet or anisotropic gaps in the superconductor ; lithographic techniques could be brought to bear in order to have well defined superconducting bridges and injection contacts ; and it should be possible to identify the effects of the spin - polarized quasiparticles on @xmath0 . + still , two points deserve special interest .",
    "the first is that , in planning such an f / i / s experiment , there is the potential problem of insufficient knowledge of the tunneling process .",
    "this was already apparent in the work of meservey and tedrow cited above @xcite since the experiments always showed a positive sign for the spin polarization , even in the cases of e.g. co and ni where a negative sign was expected .",
    "recently , this was explained by demonstrating that the choice of barrier material can strongly influence and even reverse the spin polarization of the tunneling current @xcite , with obvious consequences for the interpretation of the injection experiments .",
    "it may be advantageous to also contemplate an ( f or n)/i / f / s configuration ; in this case the barrier is only used to increase the energy of the electrons coming from an n or f contact , while the polarization now takes place in a thin f layer between barrier and superconductor .",
    "the disadvantage here is that the f layer in connection with the superconductor will suppress the order parameter and therefore @xmath0 in the s layer .",
    "still , since the proximity effect ( which gives rise to the depression ) for s / f systems is understood reasonably well @xcite , the effect on @xmath0 may also be quantifiable . the second point for consideration",
    "is that even in the case of conventional superconductors the determination of @xmath0 need not be straightforward .",
    "the difficulty lies in the fact that the superconducting bridge must have a width of no more than both the superconducting penetration depth @xmath16 and the superconducting coherence length @xmath17 .",
    "the first is needed to avoid current pile - up near the edges ( as a consequence of screening of the self - field ) , the second is required in order to avoid vortex nucleation and flow , which gives rise to dissipation before @xmath0 is reached .",
    "these conditions can be met e.g. for al , which has a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) coherence length @xmath18 of about 1.5  @xmath19 , while @xmath16 can also be made of the order of 1  @xmath19 by making the film thin enough . for al - bridges of less than 1 @xmath19 wide it was shown by romijn _ et al . _",
    "@xcite that the measured @xmath0 agreed very well with the theoretical calculations by kuprianov and lukichev @xcite based on the eilenberger equations and therefore valid in the whole temperature regime below @xmath2 . for a material such as nb , with @xmath18 and @xmath16 of the order of 50  nm , such agreement need not be expected .",
    "+ in this paper we show that , at least close to @xmath2 , the values of the zero - field critical current @xmath3 measured on bridge - structured nb samples are essentially the values expected for the depairing current .",
    "furthermore , we measure the depression of @xmath3 in trilayers of fe / nb / fe as function of the thickness @xmath5 of the nb layer .",
    "we compare the behaviour of @xmath20 with the behaviour of @xmath21 , and also with calculations of the proximity effect and the pairbreaking velocity using a two - parameter formalism based on the usadel equations .",
    "we find that @xmath20 is well described by the same two parameters which describe the behaviour of @xmath21 .",
    "the conclusion is that the suppression of the depairing current as a consequence of the depression of the order parameter in s / f structures can be well described by proximity effect theory , making ( f , n)/i / f / s injection experiments a distinct possibility .",
    "close to @xmath2 , the classical ginzburg - landau ( gl ) result for the temperature dependence of the depairing current of a thin film , under the assumption of a homogeneous superconducting order parameter over the film thickness , is given by : @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath0 is of the order of @xmath24 , with @xmath25 the thermodynamic critical field , and will be given more precisely below .",
    "for arbitrary temperatures , calculations were performed by kupriyanov and lukichev , who essentially solved the eilenberger equations for a superconductor carrying a current , with the velocity of the condensate leading to a phase gradient @xcite .",

    "comparison with eq .",
    "[ eq : jdpgl ] shows that the ratio between the saturation value and the gl - extrapolated value equals @xmath40 = 0.385 .",
    "+ in the case of f / s ( or n / s ) multilayers , the superconducting order parameter is depressed near the interfaces , and this has to be taken into account in calculating @xmath0 . for this",
    "we use the proximity effect model , based on the usadel equations ( dirty limit conditions ) , which was also used for calculating the depression of @xmath2 with decreasing thickness of the superconductor @xcite .",
    "details will be given in appendix  a but here we briefly introduce the main parameters of the theory . in principle , the shape of the order parameter on both sides of the interface depends on the bulk transition temperature @xmath41 , on the coherence lengths @xmath42 , on the normal state resistivities @xmath43 , and on the transparency @xmath7 of the interface . from the boundary conditions for the order parameter ( see eqs .",
    "[ eq : bound ] ) it follows that , apart from @xmath41 , only two independent parameters are needed , the proximity strength parameter @xmath44 and the transparency parameter @xmath45 .",
    "the value of @xmath44 = @xmath46 can be fully determined from experiment ; the only free parameter is @xmath45 ( @xmath47 ) , which is approximately connected to the transparency @xmath7 ( with @xmath48 ) by @xmath49 as was shown in ref  @xcite , in f / s systems , @xmath7 can be quite low for a high magnetic moment in the f - layer , which is presumably due to the suppression of andreev reflections by the exchange splitting of the spin subbands . fig .  [",
    "fig : theory ] gives the results of some typical calculations , performed for the system fe / nb / fe with the appropriate proximity effect parameters @xmath50 34.6 and @xmath51 42 ( see section  [ results ] ) .",

    "note that this involves a factor @xmath55 .    the thickness dependence of @xmath2 and the normalised depairing current at t = 0 ( see the insert of fig .",
    "[ fig : theory ] ) are quite different , with a much stronger depression of the depairing current at relatively high thickness of the superconductor .",
    "this can be qualitatively understood by noting that @xmath2 is a measure for the maximum value of the superconducting order parameter in the layer , while the depairing current comes from an average over the layer thickness , which also involves lower values of the order parameter .",
    "samples were grown on si(100 ) substrates , by dc sputtering in a system with a base pressure of 10@xmath56  mbar in an ar - pressure of @xmath57 mbar .",
    "sputtering rates were of the order 0.1  nm / s for nb and 0.03  nm / s for fe .",
    "one series of samples consisted of trilayers nb / fe / nb with nb thickness @xmath5",
    "= 5  nm and the fe thickness @xmath58 varying between 2  nm and 25  nm .",
    "these were used to determine the magnetization @xmath59 of the fe layers in the presence of fe / nb interfaces with a commercial squid - based magnetometer .",
    "the behavior of @xmath59 versus @xmath58 could be well described with a straight line , yielding a magnetic moment per fe atom of 2.36  @xmath60 ( @xmath60 being the bohr magneton ) , slightly above the bulk value of 2.2  @xmath60 and a magnetically dead layer per interface of 0.1  nm .",
    "this value is somewhat lower than reported for mbe - grown samples @xcite .",
    "two other series of samples consisted of trilayers of fe / nb / fe with @xmath58  = 5  nm and varying @xmath5 .",

    "the length between the voltage contacts was 1  mm .",
    "the first set ( deposited in two different runs ) was used for measuring @xmath21 , the second set for both @xmath21 and @xmath62 . in all cases , the typical width of the resistive transitions to the superconducting state was 50  mk .    also measured",
    "were single films of fe and nb with different strip widths in order to establish values for the specific resistivity @xmath63 ( at 10  k ) , for @xmath2 and for the upper critical field @xmath64 .",

    "this corresponds to @xmath72  = 7.8  nm .",
    "no special precautions were taken to shield residual magnetic fields .",
    "the zero - field critical current @xmath73 was determined at different temperatures @xmath7 by measuring current ( @xmath74)- voltage ( @xmath75 ) characteristics . for this , a dc current was switched on for the time of the order of 1  s and the voltage recorded , to prevent heating via the contacts .",

    "the current was also turned off since the sample then started to heat immediately .",

    "both conditions mean for all samples @xmath122 , much smaller than the region where @xmath123 , ( fig .",
    "[ jcjc0vt ] ) , and the question is valid whether the current is uniform , as has implicitly been assumed in the analysis .",
    "+ qualitatively , current is expected to pile up at the edges of the strip in order to minimize the self - field inside .",
    "the edge current will then sooner reach the value of @xmath124 . by using @xmath125 , this would lead to underestimating the real value of @xmath0 . from the close agreement between the experimental and theoretical values",
    "this does not appear to be the case .",
    "quantitatively , the situation can be assessed that the self - field of the sample is completely screened ( @xmath126 in the sample ) .",
    "the current distribution is then given by @xcite  : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the transport current through the sample , @xmath129 is in the direction of the width @xmath61 of the film , @xmath130 in the middle of the film and @xmath131 . according to this formula ,",

    "in this paper we have addressed the question of the value of the superconducting depairing current in f / s / f trilayers with varying @xmath1 , where the superconducting order parameter is inhomogeneously suppressed by the pair breaking in the f - layers . the same model which is adequately describes the suppression of @xmath2 with decreasing @xmath1 with two parameters ( proximity strength @xmath44 and interface transparency @xmath45 or @xmath7 ) can also be used to compute the suppression of the depairing current .",
