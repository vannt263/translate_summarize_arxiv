    "thanks to the capabilities of current x - ray observatories ( chandra and xmm - newton ) , a new class of x - ray sources has been discovered in the past few years , namely those associated to protostellar jets .",
    "this class consists of about ten members , hh 154 being one of the best studied .",
    "the x - ray source associated with hh 154 has been previously observed by xmm - newton ( @xcite ) and by chandra ( @xcite ) .",
    "these observations had shown that the x - ray source is stationary over a period of 4 years with a possible transient and faint component in the 2005 chandra observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "hydrodynamic models of the interaction between a continuously ejected supersonic jet and the ambient medium predict x - ray emission caused by shocks at the interaction front ( @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray emission close to the base of the jet is predicted in the case of a pulsed - jet ( @xcite ) .",
    "the pulsed - jet model is very effective in reproducing the features and variability observed in most of the x - ray emitting jets from low - mass young stellar objects ( @xcite ) . in the pulsed - jet scenario",
    ", @xcite provided predictions on future observations of hh 154 and claimed that a stationary x - ray source on a period of @xmath0 years is unlikely . for a stationary x - ray source",
    ", they suggested that a nozzle formed by either a dense medium or a magnetic field may be at work at the launching site , leading to the formation of a stationary diamond shock at the base of the jet .",
    "the new chandra observation of hh 154 ( collected in 2009 ) provides a time base of 8 years to analyze the spectral and morphological variability of the x - ray source .",
    "here we analyze the 2009 observations and compare the results of the data analysis with the previous chandra ( @xcite ) and xmm / newton ( @xcite ) observations .",
    "we have developed a model describing a protostellar jet outflowing from a nozzle and compare the x - ray emission synthesized from the model with the chandra observations .",
    "finally we interpret the new and the previous observations in the light of our model results . in sect .",
    "2 we describe the chandra observations and their analysis ; in sect .",
    "3 we discuss the hydrodynamic model of jet / nozzle and the comparison between model predictions and observations ; in sect .",
    "4 we discuss the results and draw our conclusions .",
    "we present the new chandra / acis - s data of hh 154 ( pi schneider ; obsid 11016 ; @xmath1 ks ) centered at ( 04:31:34.998 , @xmath218:07:51.95 ) ( fk5 ) , performed on 29 dec .",
    "2009 , that provides @xmath3 years of time base between the first ( 2001 , @xcite ) and the last chandra observations of hh 154 , with the intermediate observation of 2005 ( @xcite ) . to derive a uniform comparison between the three chandra data - sets , we reprocessed all the data with the same method , using the latest ciao 4.3 package , and filtered the data to restrict the energy to the @xmath4 kev band , as in @xcite .",
    "events were extracted for all observations from regions around the source and the background , near the position of the hh 154 jet ( 4:31:34.10 , @xmath218:08:04.9 ) , following @xcite .",
    "we defined a box @xmath5 in the 2001 data - set , a box @xmath6 in the 2005 data - set , and a box @xmath7 in the 2009 data - set , to extract the source events , and four @xmath8 pixel radius circles for the background , from source - free parts of the image around the source .",
    "we extracted the spectra of the three data - sets and produced the ancillary response files , arf and rmf , by using specextract .",
    "we grouped the spectra to have a minimum of @xmath9 counts per bin .",
    "we also applied the sub - pixel repositioning algorithm available in ciao 4.3 ( edser ) to the chandra images to refine the event positions ( @xcite ) .",
    "we resample the improved images at @xmath10 pixel size , obtaining images with one - half of the native acis pixel scale .",
    "[ mappa - x - bin ] shows the x - ray source associated with hh 154 in 2001 ( first panels ) , 2005 ( second panels ) , and 2009 ( third panels ) , and the x - ray maps synthesized from our hydrodynamic model ( discussed in sect . [ the model ] ) with the same spatial resolution as acis ( last panels ) .",
    "the upper panels show the images with the native acis pixel size ( @xmath11 ) ; the central panels show the images with sub - pixel repositioning algorithm applied and resampled with a pixel size @xmath10 ; the lower panels show the improved resampled images smoothed using a gaussian kernel of width @xmath11 .",
    "the three chandra data - sets show that the x - ray emission is mainly located at the base of the hh 154 jet in all epochs , near the driving source .",
    "@xcite found that the x - ray source is displaced by @xmath12 with respect to the l1551 irs5 driving source .",
    "the x - ray source consists of a bright knot which appears to be stationary in the time period covered by the observations ( in the following the `` stationary '' component ) and an elongated structure directed away from the driving source ( in the following the `` elongated '' component ) showing variability in the three data - sets ( see fig [ mappa - x - bin ] ) . in particular , the latter component appears as a knot in images with edser applied ( central and lower panels in fig .",
    "[ mappa - x - bin ] ) which is much fainter than the knot of the stationary component .",
    "the position of the faint knot appears to be different in the three data - sets . in particular , for the 2001 and 2005 data , we confirm the results of @xcite , i.e. an elongation of the x - ray source corresponding to a proper motion of @xmath13/yr approximately westward away from the driving source of the hh 154 jet . as for the 2009 observations",
    ", there is an hint of a faint knot closer to the brighter stationary source than in 2005 .",
    "note that recently an asymmetry in the chandra psf has been discovered , located at @xmath14 , corresponding to @xmath15 in 2009 observations , i.e. roughly the direction of the extension of the x - ray source detected in hh 154 .",
    "we checked if this instrumental effect may influence the observed morphology of the x - ray source and found that the asymmetry of the psf does not affect our images on scales larger than 1 arcsec .",
    "the elongated structure visible in the images , therefore , is not an artifact of the instrument .",
    "the maximum length of the whole x - ray source is @xmath16 ( @xmath17 au at @xmath18 pc ) .",
    "we performed a spectral analysis of the individual data sets .",
    "all spectra are well fitted by an absorbed thermal plasma ( apec in xspec ) .",
    "the count rates of the three observations ( @xmath19 cnts / ks in 2001 , @xmath20 cnts / ks in 2005 , and @xmath21 cnts / ks in 2009 ) are compatible within the poisson error , indicating that the x - ray luminosity is constant .",
    "moreover the source shows no spectral variability in terms of temperature ( @xmath22 ) and emission measure ( @xmath23 ) in the timescale analyzed here .",
    "we have thus fit the three data - sets simultaneously finding the values reported in table [ fit ] .",
    "crrrrrrrrrrr @xmath22 & @xmath23 & @xmath24 & @xmath25 & @xmath26 + ( k ) & ( @xmath27 ) & ( erg @xmath28 s@xmath29 ) & ( erg s@xmath29 ) & ( @xmath28 ) + @xmath30 & @xmath31 & @xmath32 & @xmath33 & @xmath34 +    the @xmath26 is well constrained ( more than in the analysis of xmm - newton data ; @xcite ) by fitting the three data - sets simultaneously but it can not be constrained by the individual data - sets . in the latter case we fixed @xmath26 to the value derived in the simultaneous fitting of the three data - sets .",
    "the three data - sets and the best - fit model are shown in fig .",
    "[ spettri ] .    to investigate possible spatial variations of the spectral properties , we selected two regions , confining the stationary component ( blue box in fig .",
    "[ mappa - x - bin ] ) and the elongated component ( green box in fig .",
    "[ mappa - x - bin ] ) , and computed the median photon energy , @xmath35 , within each region in 2001 , 2005 , and 2009 .",
    "@xmath35 has been proved to be a robust indicator of the spectral properties of a source in the case of low statistics ( @xcite ) . in each data - set the total number of counts considered is @xmath36 , in the stationary component , and @xmath37 , in the elongated component .",
    "the stationary component shows no temporal variability in the three epochs , its mpe varying in the range @xmath38 kev .",
    "the median energy of the elongated component @xmath39 is always lower than @xmath40 . by considering the three observations altogether",
    "@xmath41 kev , while the elongated component appears softer with @xmath42 kev .",
    "this result is supported by the kolmogorov - smirnov test we performed to check if the photon energy distributions of the two regions differ significantly and vary with time .",
    "we found that the stationary and the elongated component are compatible with being constant over the time base analyzed .",
    "we also found that the two components are dissimilar at the @xmath43 confidence level . in the light of this result",
    ", we have fitted simultaneously the data collected in the three epochs for each of the two components and found that the stationary component is described by a plasma with @xmath44 k and the elongated component by a plasma with @xmath45 k ( assuming the same @xmath46 for the two spectra ) , confirming that the elongated component is softer .",
    "x - ray observations of hh 154 suggest the presence of a steady shock at the base of the jet over a time interval of about @xmath3 years . examples of quasi - stationary shocks in jets are the diamond shocks , namely stationary shock patterns appearing in supersonic jets when the jet material outflowing from a nozzle is slightly over or under - expanded or , in other words , when the pressure of the gas exiting the nozzle is below or above the pressure of the ambient medium .",
    "@xcite suggested that a diamond shock forming near the launching / collimation site of the jet is the most likely mechanism leading to a stationary x - ray source in hh 154 .    to test the above idea",
    ", we extended the hydrodynamic model of @xcite ( to which the reader is referred for more details ) , describing the interaction between a continuously ejected supersonic jet with the unperturbed medium , by adding a diverging nozzle at the base of the jet included as an impenetrable body ( see fig .",
    "[ nozzle ] ) .",
    "the model is described by the hydrodynamic equations solved in two dimensions ( adopting cylindrical coordinates and assuming axisymmetry with the jet axis coincident with the axis of symmetry ; @xcite ) and takes into account the thermal conduction ( including heat flux saturation ) and radiative losses from optically thin plasma .",
    "the calculations were performed using flash , a well tested adaptive mesh refinement multiphysics code ( @xcite ) .    the jet with temperature @xmath47 k outflows from the nozzle and propagates through an initial uniform ambient medium with the same temperature .",
    "the initial jet radius depends on the nozzle size , chosen accordingly with observations of the order of tens of au ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we have explored a wide space of model parameters defined by the particle number density of the jet ranging between @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xmath27 , the density of the ambient medium ranging between @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xmath27 , the throat of the nozzle with radius ranging between @xmath52 and 200 au , and the jet velocity ranging between @xmath53 and @xmath54 km s@xmath29 .",
    "we assume that the direction of propagation of the jet is perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "our best - fit model is characterized by @xmath48 @xmath27 , @xmath50 @xmath27 , @xmath55 km s@xmath29 , and @xmath56 au .",
    "the jet is overexpanded and travels through an initially denser ambient medium ( light jet scenario ; see @xcite ) with ambient - to - jet density contrast @xmath57 .",
    "the computational domain is @xmath58 au ( @xmath59 arcsec at @xmath60 pc ) .",
    "inflow boundary conditions are imposed at @xmath61 and @xmath62 , axisymmetric boundary conditions are imposed along the jet axis ( consistent with the adopted symmetry ) , and outflow boundary conditions are assumed elsewhere . the maximum spatial resolution achieved by our simulations is @xmath63 au , using @xmath9 refinement levels with the paramesh library ( @xcite ) , which corresponds to covering the initial jet radius of our best - fit model with 50 grid points .",
    "the grid resolution is increased inside the nozzle and around the nozzle exit to capture the diamond structure forming there .",
    "note that the pixel size of the hydrodynamic model at its maximum spatial resolution ( @xmath64 au ) corresponds to a spatial resolution of @xmath65 at the distance of @xmath66 pc , i.e. much lower than the nominal spatial resolution of acis ( @xmath11 ) . as discussed below",
    ", this implies that the synthetic maps derived from the hydrodynamic model needs to be rebinned to match the acis pixel size in order to compare the model results with the observations .",
    "following @xcite , we synthesized the x - ray emission associated with the jet from the model results , recovering the 3-dimensional spatial distributions of mass density and temperature .",
    "we then derived the emission measure , @xmath23 , and temperature , @xmath22 , for each fluid element and the distribution @xmath67 integrated along the line of sight , for each element , in the temperature range @xmath68 k ( using @xmath69 bins equispaced in @xmath70 ) . from the em(t ) , we synthesize the maps of the x - ray emission and the focal plane spectra using the apec spectral code , and considering photon count statistics comparable with that of the observations .",
    "the source is assumed to be at a distance @xmath18 pc .",
    "we filtered the emission through the chandra / acis instrumental response and the interstellar column density at the best - fit value @xmath71 @xmath28 ( see sect . [ results - obs ] ) .",
    "in particular , to compare the synthesized images with the different observations , we have used the rmf and arf files generated for the three data - sets ( 2001 , 2005 , and 2009 ) to account for the correction to the charge transfer inefficiency and the degradation in low - energy response due to contaminant buildup on the optical blocking filter .    to directly compare the synthesized images with the observations , we rebinned the model images ( whose spatial resolution is @xmath64 au , corresponding to @xmath65 at @xmath66 pc ) so as to have the same bin size as the chandra images as shown in fig .",
    "[ mappa - x - bin ] ( @xmath10 , or @xmath11 ) .",
    "we also convolved the synthesized x - ray image with the specific psf , created at the proper energy for each data set , by using the chandra standard analysis tools .",
    "we finally included poisson fluctuations to mimic the photon count statistics .",
    "figure  [ mappa ] shows the spatial distribution of density in a slice in the @xmath72 plane ( left panel ) for the best - fit model at time @xmath73 yrs and a close up view of the nozzle site ( right bottom panel ) . after the jet exits the nozzle",
    ", it propagates through the ambient medium forming a shock with temperature @xmath74 k at its head and a cold cocoon enveloping it .",
    "the cocoon is characterized by low temperatures ( @xmath75 k ) , is dominated by the radiative cooling , and is strongly perturbed by the hydrodynamic instability developing there as the jet progresses through the medium , the thermal conduction being inefficient in damping the instability ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the nozzle determines a diamond - shaped shock past the nozzle exit with peak temperature @xmath76 k ( see right bottom panel in fig .  [ mappa ] ) .",
    "this diamond structure has its origin inside the nozzle and appears as a shock emerging from the nozzle and reflecting just past of the nozzle exit .",
    "after its formation ( @xmath77 yrs ) , the diamond shock is almost stationary until the end of the simulation for @xmath78 yrs .",
    "the thermal conduction is rather efficient in the post - shock region given the high temperatures there ( @xmath79 k ) and is crucial in stabilizing the diamond structure , damping the hydrodynamic instability developing past the nozzle exit .",
    "auxiliary simulations performed without the thermal conduction have shown that the diamond shock would be unstable if the thermal conduction is neglected , the hydrodynamic instability heavily perturbing the flow structure at the nozzle exit .    analyzing the x - ray emission synthesized from the hydrodynamic model , as described in sect .",
    "[ synthesis of x - ray emission ] , we investigated both the morphology and spectral properties of the synthetic x - ray sources .",
    "the x - ray emission from the modeled jet consists of two main features : a quasi - stationary source associated with the diamond shock at the jet base and a moving source associated with the shock at the head of the jet .",
    "the latter is a transient feature we are not interested in and does not influence the evolution of the diamond shock at the base of the jet ; therefore we will not discuss its properties in the following .        the x - ray luminosity of the diamond shock is @xmath80 erg and is stationary over @xmath78 yrs .",
    "this value is similar to that observed for hh 154 that is almost stationary in about @xmath3 years .    by comparing the total flux derived from the model with the specific rmf and arf response of each data - set",
    ", we have verified that the degraded qe of the instrument in the time baseline analyzed affects the synthesized count rate for less than @xmath81 .",
    "this confirms that the source flux can be assumed constant over @xmath3 yrs , within the poisson errors .    the right upper panel in fig .",
    "[ mappa ] shows the synthetic x - ray emission arising from the shock integrated along the line - of - sight .",
    "most of the emission originates just behind the shock in a bright and compact knot with temperature @xmath76 k. the knot is surrounded by a diffuse region elongated along the jet axis , characterized by lower temperatures ( @xmath82 k ) .",
    "figure  [ mod_prof ] shows the profiles of density and temperature along the jet axis in the region where the diamond shock forms .",
    "we found that the spectrum synthesized from the hydrodynamic model , as explained in sect .",
    "[ synthesis of x - ray emission ] , can be fitted with one isothermal component which is compatible with that derived from the three data - sets of chandra .",
    "we rescaled the synthetic x - ray image shown in fig .",
    "[ mappa ] to the chandra / acis pixel size ( last panels in fig .",
    "[ mappa - x - bin ] ) .",
    "the emission within the nozzle is assumed to be totally absorbed .",
    "we found that the spatial scales of the x - ray emitting diamond shock at the same spatial resolution of chandra are consistent with the size of the hh 154 x - ray emitting source : a synthetic x - ray source of a few arcsec at the base of the jet consisting of a bright point - like component surrounded by a faint and elongated component along the jet axis .    in fig .",
    "[ contour ] we compare the smoothed 2001 image with a bin size @xmath10 ( left panel ) with the x - ray source derived from the model at its maximum spatial resolution , @xmath65 , ( right panel ) . the 2001 image contour is superimposed on the modeled source .     compared with the high resolution ( @xmath65 ) image derived from the model ( right panel ) .",
    "the contour of the observed source is superimposed on the images . since we verified that",
    "the direction of the psf asymmetry in 2001 is along the counter jet and since this asymmetry can produce artificial structures only out to @xmath83 ( four pixels at the @xmath10 pixel size of the image on the left panel ) , the observed elongation is not an artifact due to the psf asymmetry .",
    "the angular size of each panel is @xmath84 . in both panels , north is up and east is left.,width=302 ]",
    "the analysis of the observations of hh 154 in three different epochs with chandra reveals a faint and elongated x - ray source displaced by @xmath85 arcsec ( @xcite ) from the l1551 irs5 protostar ( the driving source of the jet ) along the jet axis .",
    "the source appears to be quasi - stationary over a time base of @xmath86 yrs without appreciable proper motion and variability of x - ray luminosity and of temperature .",
    "the morphological analysis shows that the x - ray source consists of a bright stationary component with temperature @xmath87 k surrounded by an elongated cooler component extended in the direction away from the driving source , with temperatures @xmath88 k. very recently @xcite analyzed the same data - sets finding similar observational results in terms of x - ray luminosity , spectral parameters , and morphology , independently showing the robustness of the derived parameters that form the basis of our comparison with a simulation of the jet based on detailed hydrodynamic models .    as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the x - ray source is not perfectly aligned with the optical jet observed in hh 154 ( see fig .",
    "13 in @xcite ) .",
    "in fact the hst images of @xcite show that the optical jet from hh 154 is along @xmath89 ( see also @xcite ) , while from the x - ray data we derive a @xmath90 .",
    "@xcite suggested that an ejection direction varying in time could explain the misalignment between the x - ray source and the optical jet . since the jet driving source , l1551 irs5 ,",
    "is known to be a binary system ( @xcite ) , a jet precession could be induced due to the presence of the companion star .",
    "the absorption column density derived from the analysis of the three data - sets is too low if compared with the 150 mag of absorption of l1551 irs5 , confirming the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this fact together with the evident displacement of @xmath91 of the source from l1551 irs5 and the lack of temporal variation in the x - ray flux and spectral properties suggest that the x - ray emission detected in the three epochs unambiguously arises from the jet and can not be of stellar origin .",
    "the observations suggest therefore that the x - ray emission of hh 154 originates in a standing shock located at the base of the jet .",
    "@xcite , by analyzing the x - ray emission arising from a pulsed jet model , have discussed the possibility to produce a standing shock at the base of the jet as a result of multiple self - interactions of plasma blobs ejected in different epochs by the driving source and concluded that this mechanism is unlikely .",
    "in addition these authors suggested that the most likely mechanism leading to a standing shock over a period @xmath92 yrs might be a diamond shock forming near the launching / collimation site of the jet .",
    "this idea is expanded here by developing a model of jet outflowing through a nozzle .",
    "we found that , in such a configuration , a standing diamond shock forms just past the nozzle exit at the base of the jet .",
    "the shock is stabilized under the action of the thermal conduction which damps the hydrodynamic instability developing within the cocoon and heavily perturbing the flow structure .",
    "we found that the x - ray emission arising from the diamond shock has morphology and spectral characteristics in excellent agreement with those derived from the three data - sets of hh 154 .",
    "the model also predicts that the x - ray emitting plasma of the diamond shock cools down at larger distances from the driving source as inferred from the observations .",
    "in fact , from the chandra data , we found that the mpe increases toward the base of the jet . while we can not rule out that this result is associated with variations in @xmath93 ( @xcite found an increasing absorption towards the driving source along the jet axis ) , higher values of mpe",
    "can be indicative of higher temperatures .",
    "such variations of plasma temperature would be naturally explained by our model .",
    "we conclude therefore that hh 154 offers the first evidence of a standing diamond shock at the base of the jet probably near the jet launching / collimation region .",
    "we can infer a characteristic size , @xmath94 , of the x - ray emitting source from the spectral analysis , using the value of the @xmath95 , and from the hydrodynamic model results , using the maximum particle density value derived from the diamond shock modeled .",
    "in particular , we find @xmath96 cm , where @xmath97 is the volume derived from the @xmath98 ( following @xcite ) and @xmath99 @xmath27 ( see the peak of density in fig . [ mod_prof ] ) at @xmath66 pc .",
    "this value is in good agreement with both the observed radius of hh 154 , @xmath100 au ( see discussion on this parameter in both models and observations in @xcite and @xcite ) , and with the size of the diamond shock modeled .",
    "therefore , although the spatial resolution of the acis data , improved by sub - pixel techniques , is more than an order of magnitude lower than that achieved by our numerical model , its diagnostic power allows us to infer detailed information on physical scales comparable to numerical simulations .",
    "the data , after this analysis , clearly show the presence of an elongated structure on the right side of the main source . concerning an eventual evolution of this elongated structure",
    "the most conservative interpretation could be that it is steady and we can hardly constrain its features , due to the limited photon statistics .",
    "however , given the insight provided by the model and the evidence that stellar jets flows are inherently variable , another interpretation is that we are observing the diamond shock variability and possibly knots formation and motion due to the changes of the jet flow ( cf .",
    "@xcite for example of effects of variable jet flows ) . the sequence of the smoothed images of hh 154 with a spatial scale of @xmath10 shown in fig .",
    "[ mappa - x - bin ] suggests the presence of subsequent knots with a detectable proper motion .",
    "in particular , by comparing the 2001 and 2005 data - sets , we confirm the results of @xcite who found a detectable westward proper motion of the elongated component of the x - ray source , corresponding to @xmath101 km / s ; we find a hint of elongation again westward in the 2009 observations away from the jet driving source , but closer to the stationary source than in the 2005 observations .",
    "this evidence may suggest the presence of a newly formed knot propagating away from the diamond shock .",
    "however note that , in the 2009 observation , the psf asymmetry is directed almost along the x - ray extension axis , and therefore it could influence the x - ray source elongation up to an angular scale @xmath102 . therefore ,",
    "both the evidence of a standing shock at the base of the hh 154 jet over a @xmath3 yrs timebase and a moving knot in 2005 together with a hint of a new elongation in the 2009 smoothed image , indicate the scenario of a nozzle , creating the standing shock , in the presence of a pulsed jet , as described in @xcite , which may account for the moving / elongated component .",
    "no matter how one interprets the observations , there is a clear need for future observations of hh 154 .",
    "the physical origin of the nozzle could be related to the dense gas in which the l1551 irs5 protostar is embedded and/or the intense stellar magnetic field at the jet launching / collimation region . in the hypothesis that a magnetic nozzle causes",
    "the diamond shock observed in hh 154 , the chandra observations and the comparison with our model offer the possibility to constrain the magnetic field strength near the jet launching / collimation region .",
    "in fact , the model provides the total plasma pressure @xmath103 in the x - ray emitting diamond shock that reproduces the observations , where @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the pressure , mass density and velocity in the post - shock region close to the nozzle exit , respectively .",
    "then , assuming the plasma @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the magnetic field strength , we derive @xmath109 mg in the magnetic nozzle at the base of the jet .",
    "interestingly , this value is consistent with that inferred by @xcite , namely @xmath110 mg , in the context of shocks associated to jet collimation , and by @xcite , who find @xmath111 mg , which is a reasonable value at the jet basis near the driving source , according to @xcite .",
    "we suggest therefore that the comparison between our model and the x - ray observations of hh 154 may allow us to probe the launching / collimation region near the driving source , very difficult to be directly observed in systems so obscured .",

    "<S> we conclude that the x - ray emission from hh 154 is consistent with a diamond shock originating from a nozzle through which the jet is launched into the ambient medium . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the physical origin of the nozzle could be related to the dense gas in which the hh 154 driving source is embedded and/or to the magnetic field at the jet launching / collimation region . </S>"
