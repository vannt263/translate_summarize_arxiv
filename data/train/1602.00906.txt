    "this article contributes to a better understanding of learning by two classic processes , replicator and best - response , by exposing the importance of the player s indifference among all possible strategies . in particular , even though the initial conditions of play leading to a given pure nash equilibrium may differ according to whether learning proceeds through replicator or best - response , if the pure nash equilibrium is locally stable , the existence of a fully mixed unstable nash equilibrium , together with an invariance condition , guarantees that there is always a non - vanishing set from which learning produces the same pure nash equilibrium as an outcome , regardless of the learning mechanism .",
    "the existence of the interior nash equilibrium means that all types are present in the population mix ( or equivalently , that players are indifferent among all possible actions ) .",
    "the instability of this nash equilibrium and the invariance property of the set @xmath32 containing the pure nash equilibrium indicate that arbitrarily close to total indifference , the type characterising the pure nash equilibrium is prefered .",
    "our results also point towards some similarity between the two learning mechanisms and furthermore show the role of the invariance of the indifference sets in maximising this similarity .",
    "however , when the basins of attraction differ , their geometry allows room for further research on understanding these differences and their causes .",
    "hopefully , experiments will provide further insight ."
