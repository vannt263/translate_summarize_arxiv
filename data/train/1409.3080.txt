    "from zimin s explicit classification of unavoidable words , a natural question arises in the ramsey theory paradigm : for a fixed unavoidable word @xmath1 , how long can a word be that avoids @xmath1 ?",
    "our approach to this question is to start with avoiding the zimin words , which gives upper bounds for all unavoidable words .",
    "define @xmath58 to be the smallest integer @xmath59 such that every @xmath13-ary word of length @xmath59 encounters @xmath4 .        for",
    "the inductive hypothesis , assume the claim is true for some positive @xmath57 and set @xmath68 .",
    "that is , every @xmath13-ary word of length @xmath69 encounters @xmath4 .",
    "concatenate any @xmath70 strings @xmath71 of length @xmath69 with an arbitrary letter @xmath72 between @xmath73 and @xmath74 for each positive @xmath75 : @xmath76    by the pigeonhole principle , @xmath77 for some @xmath78 .",
    "that string , being length @xmath69 , encounters @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , we have some word @xmath79 that is an instance of @xmath4 and shows up twice , disjointly , in @xmath18 .",
    "the extra letter @xmath80 guarantee that the two occurrences of @xmath0 are not consecutive .",
    "this proves that an arbitrary word of length @xmath81 witnesses @xmath82 , so @xmath83      the technique used to prove theorem [ upper ] is first found in lothaire s proof of unavoidability of @xmath4 ( @xcite , 3.1.3 ) .",
    "the technique in zimin s original proof @xcite implicitly gives that for @xmath88 , @xmath89 this is an ackermann - type function for an upper bound , which is much larger than the primitive recursive bound from theorem [ upper ] .           + the following binary word of length 10482 avoids @xmath93 .",
    "this implies that @xmath94 .",
    "the word is presented here as an image with each row , consisting of 90 squares , read left to right .",
    "each square , black or white , represents a bit . for example",
    ", the longest string of black in the first row is 14 bits long .",
    "we can not have the same bit repeated @xmath95 times consecutively , as that would be a @xmath92-instance .",
    "a string of 14 white bits is found in the 46th row . +           + the code to generate a @xmath92-avoiding word of length 10482 is messy .",
    "the following , easy - to - validate , inefficient , brute - force , sage @xcite code was used for verification of the word above .",
    "it took about half a day , running on an intelcorei5 - 2450 m cpu @xmath96 2.50ghz @xmath97 4 .",
