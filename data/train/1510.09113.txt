    "in the past three decades , the cosmological inflation model has been well established as the leading paradigm for the very early universe both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "it provides solutions to important problems of standard big bang cosmology such as the flatness and horizon problem and gives a mechanism for seeds of the formation of the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "although the inflation model agrees remarkably well with the observational data , it still suffers some fundamental issues , such as the fine - tuning slow - roll potential , the initial conditions , and the trans - planckian problem .",
    "in addition , the standard mechanism of inflation requires a scalar field ( an inflaton ) to drive the exponential expansion of the very early universe but physical nature and fundamental origin of an inflaton are still an open question .    since a period of inflation may occur in the very early universe",
    ", one can , in principle , expect that inflation comes from a semi - classical theory of quantum gravity with some quantum correction of einstein - hilbert action at high energy .",
    "the simplest example is @xmath5-gravity theories , where the modification of the action of einstein - hilbert action is intended to generalize the ricci scalar to be some function of the ricci scalar itself .",
    "( for a review see @xcite and references therein ) . in the 4-dimensional action in @xmath5 gravity , we write the action @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the determinant of the metric @xmath9 .",
    "the ricci scalar r is defined by @xmath10 .",
    "one can linearize the action by introducing an auxiliary field @xmath11 such that @xmath12 $ ] where we have defined @xmath13 .",
    "it is obvious that by making the variation of the action with respect to @xmath11 , we simply get @xmath14 .",
    "thus , a scalar field @xmath11 , which will be the inflaton in the scalar field representation , will propagate the freedom degree from modified gravity . in summary , in the case of @xmath5-gravity for inflation , we can pass to its scalar - field representation to achieve some useful simplification whose mechanism has been well studied in literature , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the well - known example is the `` starobinsky model '' for inflation @xcite with a correction quadratic in the ricci scalar in the modified gravity framework , and of an exponential potential in the scalar field framework .",
    "starobinsky model offers the clear origin of the inflaton field stemming from gravitational theory by identifying it with the spin-0 part of spacetime metric .",
    "adding quantum corrections to the action is not the only possible modification to einstein s gravity .",
    "almost all approaches to quantum gravity suggest that the standard energy momentum dispersion relation is deformed near the planck scale .",
    "this feature was predicted from string field theory @xcite , loop quantum gravity @xcite , non - commutative geometry @xcite .",
    "the modification of the dispersion relation generally takes the form @xmath15 the functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 are commonly known as the rainbow functions assuming @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the limit @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the energy scale that quantum effects of gravity become important .",
    "one of the interesting approaches that naturally produce modified dispersion relations is called doubly special relativity@xcite .",
    "in addition to the invariance of the speed of light , it extends special relativity by including an invariant energy scale , usually assumed to be the planck energy .",
    "magueijo and smolin @xcite generalized this idea to include curvature i.e. doubly general relativity . in their approach ,",
    "the spacetime metric felt by a free particle depends on the energy or momentum of the probe particle .",
    "thus , spacetime is represented by a one parameter family of metrics parametrized by energy of the probe @xmath22 , forming a rainbow of metrics , and hence this approach is called gravity s rainbow .",
    "the rainbow modified metric can be written as @xmath23 the energy dependence of the frame field @xmath24 can be written in terms of the energy independence frame field @xmath25 as @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath28 . in the study of cosmology , the conventional friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric for the homogeneous and isotropic universe",
    "is replaced by a rainbow metric of the form @xmath29 for simplicity , we chose @xmath30 and only considered the spatially flat case with @xmath31 .",
    "in general , the rainbow function @xmath16 does not depend on space - time coordinates since for any specific operation of measurement the probe s energy @xmath22 can be treated as a constant .",
    "however , instead of considering any specific measurement , the author in @xcite suggested that this formalism can be generalized to study semi - classical effects of relativistic particles on the background metric during a longtime process .",
    "for the very early universe , we can choose massless particles which dominate the universe at that period such as gravitons and inflatons as our probes .",
    "in this case , we need to consider the evolution of the probe s energy with cosmic time , denoted as @xmath32 . as a result",
    "the rainbow functions @xmath16 depends on time only implicitly through the energy of particles .",
    "the rainbow universe formalism was studied in the case of @xmath33 @xcite by using modified friedmann equations and the early universe is driven by thermally fluid substance .",
    "the cosmological linear perturbations of this model was studied in @xcite . in this paper , we extend this formalism to more general @xmath5 gravity , in particular the starobinsky model .",
    "qualitatively , eq . ( [ frw ] ) implies that time and space are scaled with different scaling functions i.e. the rainbow function and the scale factor respectively . by choosing suitable form of @xmath16 , one can solve the horizon problem without any need of inflationary expansion @xcite . in our case , however , the quadratic term in the ricci scalar will lead to an inflationary solution for @xmath34 .",
    "we will show how the observational data put the constraint on the scaling function @xmath16 .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . in section [ equation ] , we derive the equations of motion for @xmath5 theory in the framework of rainbow universe where cosmological evolution of probes is taken into account and written down as an inflationary solution to these equations for the case of starobinsky model .",
    "then we turn to investigate cosmological perturbation in the rainbow universe in section [ perturbation ] where the spectral index of scalar perturbation and the tensor - to - scalar ratio of the model will be calculated . in section [ data ] , we use the planck 2015 data set to constraint the rainbow parameter of our model .",
    "finally , we present our conclusion in section [ con ] .",
    "in addition to the modified frw metric ( [ frw ] ) , modifications to general relativity are expected to be possible in the very early universe where some corrections to einstein s gravity may emerge at high curvature .",
    "the simplest class of modified gravity theory is @xmath5 gravity , where the einstein - hilbert term in the action is replaced by a function of the ricci scalar . now taking this into account we derive the field equations by following the formalism in @xmath5 theory described in @xcite .",
    "we start by considering the 4-dimensional action in @xmath5 gravity : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the matter lagrangian . by varying the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to @xmath9",
    ", we obtain the field equations :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of matter fields is defined by @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 both satisfy the continuity equation i.e. @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively . in cosmology",
    ", the energy - momentum tensor of matter is given in the perfect fluid form as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the energy density and @xmath48 is the pressure . in the following , we will derive cosmological solutions to field equations ( [ eom ] ) .",
    "in so doing , let us assume the modified frw background ( [ frw ] ) , we obtain @xmath49 @xmath50 where the hubble parameter @xmath51 and @xmath52 .      in the following let us focus on the starobinsky s model @xcite in which @xmath5 takes the following form @xmath53 where @xmath21 has a dimension of mass and",
    "is chosen to be the same as the mass scale for quantum gravity in eq .",
    "( [ dispersion ] ) for simplicity .",
    "this is the first inflation model related to the conformal anomaly in quantum gravity .",
    "the @xmath54 term is responsible for the de sitter expansion .",
    "because of the linear term in @xmath55 , the inflationary expansion ends when the term @xmath56 becomes smaller than the linear term @xmath55 .",
    "this gives the graceful exit to inflation .",
    "in contrast to previous studies on rainbow universe @xcite , the @xmath54-term plays a leading role in the very early universe instead of relativistic matter .",
    "we will set @xmath57 and @xmath58 from now on .",
    "one can also consider this assumption in a scalar field framework of @xmath5 theory .",
    "for the case of starobinsky model , its classical dynamics would be equivalent to the system of one scalar ( an inflaton ) with an exponential potential .",
    "so , it is reasonable to assume that inflatons dominated the very early universe and neglect contributions from matter and radiation . then the combination of equation ( [ fr_eom_1 ] ) and ( [ fr_eom_2 ] ) gives us    @xmath59    and @xmath60 now , we consider the evolution of modified frw universe .",
    "for explicitness , we need to choose the form of @xmath16 and this can be explained in the ",
    "einstein frame , \" where the scalar degree of freedom takes a canonical form with a potential . under the conformal transformation",
    "@xmath61 with @xmath62 , the action in einstein frame can be written as @xmath63,\\ ] ] where the subscribe @xmath64 denote quantities in einstein frame .",
    "we define the scalar field ( or the inflaton ) by @xmath65 and its potential is determined by @xmath66 .",
    "note that we neglect contribution from other matters .    in this framework",
    "it is natural to choose an inflaton as our probe during the inflation .",
    "we assume that probe s energy @xmath67 is proportional to the total energy density of the inflaton , @xmath68 . during the slow - roll inflation",
    ", we can assume further that @xmath69 and it can be treated as a function of the ricci scalar in the jordan frame , @xmath55 .",
    "in the case of frw metric ( @xmath70 ) , for the starobinsky model , it is well known that @xmath71 during inflation @xcite .",
    "hence , we can now assume that the probe energy @xmath67 can be expressed in terms of a geometric expansion rate @xmath72 and this conclusion should also be applied in the jordan frame .",
    "based on these assumptions , we choose the rainbow function to be explicitly parametrized in the power - law form of the hubble parameter i.e. @xmath73 with the rainbow parameter @xmath74 and @xmath75 for late time . for the inflationary period ,",
    "we are interested in the limit @xmath76 . then , the rainbow function can be approximated as @xmath77 .",
    "equation ( [ r2_01 ] ) can be written as    @xmath78    during inflation @xmath72 is very slowly varying .",
    "we can keep the first two terms in equation ( [ r2_03 ] ) and neglect others .",
    "this gives us @xmath79 we then obtain the solution @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are hubble parameter and scale factor at the onset of inflation ( @xmath83 ) , respectively .",
    "the slow - roll parameter is defined by @xmath84 which is less than unity in the limit @xmath76 .",
    "one can also check that the approximate relation @xmath85 holds in eq .",
    "( [ r2_02 ] ) by using @xmath86 .",
    "the end of inflation ( at time @xmath87 ) can be determined by the condition @xmath88 , i.e. @xmath89^{1/(2 + 2\\lambda)}$ ] .",
    "the number of @xmath90-foldings from @xmath83 to @xmath87 is defined by @xmath91 since inflation ends at @xmath92 , we can show that @xmath93 note that for @xmath94 the model reverts to the starobinsky model .",
    "in this section , we focus on cosmological linear perturbation generated during inflation by following the formalism presented in @xcite . from the point of view of a probe particle with energy @xmath22",
    ", a general perturbed metric about the flat frw universe would take the form    @xmath95    where @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 are scalar perturbations , @xmath100 , @xmath101 are vector perturbations , and @xmath102 are tensor perturbations .",
    "the rainbow function @xmath16 can be viewed as a smooth background function . as usual",
    ", we will focus on scalar and tensor perturbations by setting vector perturbations @xmath103 . before discussing the evolution of cosmological perturbations ,",
    "we construct a number of gauge - invariant quantities required to eliminate unphysical modes .",
    "let us consider the gauge transformation @xmath104 and @xmath105 . here",
    "@xmath106 and @xmath107 denote the infinitesimal scalar functions of the spacetime coordinates",
    ". then we can show that the scalar metric perturbations transform as : @xmath108 note that the tensor perturbations @xmath102 are invariant under the gauge transformation .",

    "<S> we present a detailed derivation of the spectral index of curvature perturbation and the tensor - to - scalar ratio and compare the predictions of our models with planck 2015 data . </S>",
    "<S> we discover that in order to be consistent with planck data up to @xmath0c.l . , the viable values of @xmath1_e_-folds would satisfy @xmath2 and the rainbow parameter @xmath3 is nicely constrained to be @xmath4 . + pacs numbers : 98.80.-k , 04.50.kd , 95.30.sf </S>"
