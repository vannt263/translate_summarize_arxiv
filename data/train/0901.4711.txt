    "hard exclusive reactions and generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) have been in the focus of hadronic physics for the last decade  @xcite .",
    "gpds interpolate between elastic form factors and structure functions and contain detailed information on distributions and correlations of partons ( quarks and gluons ) in hadronic targets ( pions , nucleons , and nuclei ) .",
    "in particular , gpds describe the distribution of partons both in the longitudinal momentum direction and in the impact parameter ( transverse ) plane  @xcite and also allow to access the total angular momentum of the target carried by the partons  @xcite .",
    "the qcd factorization theorems for hard exclusive processes  @xcite state that gpds are universal distributions that enter the perturbative qcd description of various hard exclusive processes such as deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 denotes any hadronic target ) , exclusive production of mesons , @xmath8 [ where @xmath9 denotes a ( pesudo)scalar or a vector meson ] , and many other processes , including generalizations of these two reactions .",
    "although the factorization theorems make it theoretically possible to extract gpds from the data , this is a difficult task in practice since gpds are functions of four variables and the gpds enter experimentally measured observables in the form of convolution with hard coefficient functions .",
    "therefore , there is a clear need for modeling gpds , both to interpet the results of the completed experiments in terms of the microscopic structure of the hadron target and also to plan future experiments .    in this work ,",
    "we study quark and gluon gpds of heavy nuclei and dvcs on nuclear targets at small values of bjorken @xmath10 ( large energies ) . in particular",
    ", we generalize the theory of leading twist nuclear shadowing  @xcite to the case of gpds and compute next - to - leading order quark and gluon gpds of nuclei for @xmath11 and at a fixed virtuality @xmath12 . using the obtained nuclear gpds , we compute the dvcs amplitude , the dvcs cross section , and the dvcs beam - spin asymmetry for the heavy nuclear target of @xmath2pb .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * leading twist nuclear shadowing suppresses very significantly the dvcs amplitude and the dvcs cross section at small values of bjorken @xmath10 . * in the @xmath13 limit , nuclear gpds reduce to impact - parameter - dependent nuclear parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "therefore , nuclear gpds allow one to access the spatial image of nuclear shadowing .",
    "the shadowing correction to nuclear gpds introduces nontrivial correlations between the light - cone fraction @xmath1 and the impact parameter @xmath0 . * dvcs interferes with the purely electromagnetic bethe - heitler ( bh ) process . at small values of the momentum transfer @xmath4 , which dominate coherent nuclear dvcs ( without nuclear break - up ) , and also for the @xmath4-integrated cross sections ,",
    "the bh cross section is much larger than the dvcs one .",
    "this makes it rather challenging to extract a small dvcs signal on the background of the dominant bh contribution to the @xmath3 cross section .",
    "however , owing to the rapid @xmath4-dependence , the dvcs cross section becomes ( much ) larger than the bh cross section near the minima of the nuclear form factor .",
    "this suggests that the measurements of nuclear dvcs at the values of @xmath4 close to the minima of the nuclear form factor will not only be very sensitive to the magnitude of nuclear shadowing ( owing to the suppression of the nonshadowed born contribution ) , but will also have a sufficiently small bethe - heitler contribution . *",
    "another possible way to access nuclear gpds in the small @xmath10 region is through the measurement of the dvcs beam - spin asymmetry , @xmath5 .",
    "nuclear shadowing causes dramatic oscillations of the asymmetry at the fixed @xmath14 as a function of the momentum transfer @xmath4 .",
    "the position of the points where @xmath5 changes sign is directly related to the magnitude of nuclear shadowing .    the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lt_gpds ] we derive the expression for nuclear shadowing for nuclear gpds . in sec .",
    "[ sec : image ] , we analyze the @xmath15 limit of the resulting nuclear gpds , point out the equivalence of the nuclear gpds in this limit to the impact - parameter - dependent nuclear pdfs , and discuss the spacial image of nuclear shadowing . predictions for dvcs observables ( the dvcs amplitude and cross section and the beam - spin dvcs asymmetry ) are presented and discussed in sec .

    "the nuclear structure function @xmath16 measured in inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) with nuclear targets differs from the sum of free nucleon structure functions @xmath17 over the entire range of values of bjorken @xmath10  @xcite .",

    "the effect of nuclear shadowing is quite large for small @xmath10 .",
    "the kinematics of the future high - energy collider  @xcite will cover the small-@xmath10 region , where the effect of nuclear shadowing will play a major role .",
    "the leading twist ( lt ) theory of nuclear shadowing  @xcite is an approach to nuclear shadowing , in which nuclear shadowing in dis with nuclei is explained in terms of hard diffraction in lepton - nucleon dis . in particular , by using the qcd factorization theorems for inclusive and hard diffractive dis and generalizing the result for nuclear shadowing in pion - deuteron scattering obtained by v.n .",
    "gribov  @xcite , the leading twist theory of nuclear shadowing makes predictions for the shadowing correction to nuclear pdfs , @xmath20 , in terms of the free nucleon ( proton ) diffractive pdfs @xmath21 for small values of @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "one should note that the generalization of gribov s result to dis and to nuclei heavier than deuterium makes an explicit assumption that the diffractive state produced in the interaction with the first nucleon of the target elastically rescatters off the rest of the nucleons ( quasi - eikonal approximation )  @xcite . in the limit of low nuclear density , when the interaction with only two nucleons of the target is important , the relation between @xmath22 and @xmath21 is model independent . since @xmath21 is a leading twist quantity , so is @xmath22 , which explains the name _ leading twist _ theory of nuclear shadowing .",

    "<S> we find that the @xmath3 differential cross section is dominated by dvcs at the momentum transfer @xmath4 near the minima of the nuclear form factor . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that nuclear shadowing leads to dramatic oscillations of the dvcs beam - spin asymmetry , @xmath5 , as a function of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the points where @xmath5 changes sign is directly related to the magnitude of nuclear shadowing . </S>"
