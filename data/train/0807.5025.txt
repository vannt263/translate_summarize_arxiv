    "the search for direct energy - gap materials based on group iv semiconductors is not new @xcite , but has been hindered for a long time by sample preparation problems .",
    "the importance of such compounds due to their potential for technological applications was recognized early .",
    "a low - energy direct gap would enable the use for infrared applications , long - wavelength photodetector sand emiters , led and infrared laser applications , i.e. in general allow the use for optoelectronic devices . combined with the use of group iv elements",
    ", this would be ideal for compatibility and integration with the @xmath7-based technology .    while @xmath5 is an indirect - gap semiconductor ( 0.41 ev gap , fundamental energy band - gap is 0.76 ev at the diagonal l symmetry point of the fcc diamond brillouin zone)@xcite , gray tin ( @xmath8 ) is a semimetal with the same crystal structure ( no band gap , at the zone center its valence and conduction bands overlap about 0.42 ev)@xcite .",
    "it was recognized that ge@xmath0sn@xmath1 alloys should provide tunable gap materials , controlled by concentration,@xcite and a route for obtaining direct - gap group iv systems compatible with @xmath7 integrated circuits .",
    "the first experiments providing evidence for the indirect - to - direct gap transition date from 1997,@xcite while only recently crystalline samples of the quality and stability required by device applications were prepared.@xcite in the last two years further important uses for these materials were proposed : they were studied @xcite in connection with their potential use for nanostrucured thermoelectric cooling devices , and the higher electron and hole mobilities which might be reached by alloying and straining.@xcite thus , they might allow to overcome current integrated circuit limitations to develop higher speed @xmath7 microelectronics .",
    "the electronic structures of most semiconductor alloys are smooth functions of their composition , thus providing a versatile tool for device engineering .",
    "alloys of elemental semiconductors such as group iv elements @xmath7 and @xmath5 , and alloys of iii - v compounds as gaas , alas , inas and inp play key roles in microelectronics and optoelectronics .",
    "si@xmath0ge@xmath9 is nearly ideal as it has lattice constant and interband optical transition energies which are essentially linear in x. however , @xmath7-based photo - detectors e.g. can not cover the optical communication wavelength windows ( 1310 - 1550 nm ) .",
    "pure @xmath5 barely reaches the 1550 nm range , but it does nt grow well on @xmath7 substrates : this was solved by alloying @xmath5 with @xmath4 .",
    "even @xmath10 @xmath4 achieves an order of magnitude increase of absorption at 1550 nm , and the alloy grows with device quality on @xmath7 substrates .",
    "binary alloys of group iv semiconductors are usually easy to prepare at any concentration , but this is not the case for the ge@xmath0sn@xmath1 alloy .",
    "homogeneous alloys have proved difficult to form at large @xmath2 .",
    "this has considerably reduced its applicability in the fabrication of electronic devices .",
    "other group iv alloys are formed by simple substitution of one component by the other , maintaining the overall tetrahedral environment of the diamond lattice .",
    "this is true even in amorphous alloys .    at the low concentrations at which it has been possible to prepare homogeneous ge@xmath0sn@xmath1 alloys,@xcite it has been found that @xmath4 occupies substitutional sites .",
    "this results in a smooth dependence of its electronic properties as a function of concentration , which is desirable to tailor key quantities as the band gap and the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "however , at @xmath4 concentrations higher than 20@xmath11 this picture breaks down because @xmath4 exhibits the tendency to segregate in the cubic @xmath6 phase , which is metallic .",
    "this spoils the semiconducting properties .",
    "the main point of interest of our present work is to try to understand theoretically the structural and dynamical mechanisms that trigger this peculiar segregation .",
    "some authors @xcite attribute this to the large difference in size between @xmath5 and @xmath4 atoms and to the large lattice mismatch",
    ". this can not be the whole picture , because segregation has also been observed to begin at the same concentrations in amorphous alloys @xcite .",
    "our hypothesis is that the difficulty in the formation of homogeneous alloys can be explained by the nucleation of the metastable @xmath3 phase ( `` white tin '' , which is a metal and cubic ) in the perfect tetrahedral lattice of the alloy .",
    "the tetrahedral @xmath12 phase , known as `` gray tin '' , is a semiconductor with a small direct gap .",
    "we shall investigate the mechanisms by which clusters of few @xmath4 atoms can acquire a cubic symmetry in the tetrahedral @xmath5 matrix .",
    "accordingly , we assume that there exists a defect with a single @xmath4 atom bonded to six neighbouring @xmath5 atoms .",
    "this is possible due to the important role of the @xmath13orbitals in the electronic structure of both atoms .",
    "the existence of such a defect in amorphous alloys has been confirmed by detailed mssbauer experiments @xcite which show a signal corresponding to a @xmath4 atom in an octahedral environment , besides the expected signal of the substitutional tetrahedral @xmath8 defect .",
    "signatures of the presence of two sites for the @xmath4 atoms were also found with @xmath14 mssbauer spectroscopy in nanoscale mixtures of @xmath5/@xmath4.@xcite this point defect , that we shall call @xmath3 defect from now on , can be envisaged as a single @xmath4 atom at the center of a @xmath5 divacancy .",
    "this defect ( although rare ) should produce a large negative ( shrinking ) elastic field around it , opposite to the usual positive ( expansive ) elastic field of the @xmath8 defect , due to the larger size of @xmath4 as compared to @xmath5 .    in the following section we will present our hypothesis for the incorporation of @xmath4 in the @xmath5 lattic in more detail , in section iii we will describe the different approaches we have used to tackle the problem sistematically as well of the main results obtained with each , providing a quite complete scenario and consistent explanation for the experimental findings in the framework of the hypothesis we investigated .",
    "finally we will present our conclusions , discussing how our results might be useful to solve problems for sample preparation with device quality , as required for the important technological applications envisaged for these alloys , and give an outlook to further interesting research on these materials .",
    "the proposed mechanism goes as follows : small amounts of @xmath4 incorporate very easily in isolated places in the @xmath5 matrix as @xmath15 defects .",
    "the strain caused by the size mismatch increases with the concentration of these defects ( @xmath16 ) , causing a propitious environment for the formation of the @xmath6 defect , since that would release the strain in the lattice . as the @xmath12 defects get closer to the existing @xmath6 defects they attract each other through their elastic fields , and if they merge , further elastic energy would be released and the small clusters of @xmath4 atoms would relax to a cubic symmetry .",
    "therefore , if difusion allows the migration of defects during the formation , the material would present a natural tendency to segregate the @xmath4 clusters to its surface , in order to attain equilibrium .",
    "all these ideas have to be tested either by numerical calculations or statistical models .",
    "first of all , one needs accurate _ ab - initio _ electronic calculations to estimate the scale of energies involved in the immediate environment around each defect .",
    "these calculations also provide the relaxed configurations of the defects , allowing one to test the cubic symmetry locally .",
    "furthermore , by looking at small displacements within the clusters one can estimate the dependence of the electronic energy with the volume , which is a pressure directly related to the elastic field caused by the defects .",
    "all these quantities will allow to construct a model for the behavior of the macroscopic system , which will be needed to test if one can form @xmath6 defects in the alloy , and at which concentrations they would appear .    the electronic properties of the alloy can be tested by performing effective - field calculations , like the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) @xcite or the coherent potential approximation ( cpa).@xcite it is well - known that these approximations give excellent predictions in substitutional alloys , thus a failure to describe the experimental findings suggests a further indication of the presence of @xmath6 defects . in fact , we noticed that if one takes into account the structural changes undergone as a function of @xmath4 concentration , one can extend the range of validity of these approximations .",
    "in the following section we will present in detail these three approaches to the problem , and discuss the results in terms of the main hypothesis presented here .",
    "a good starting point to examine the properties of local defects in an alloy is to perform _ ab initio _ electronic calculations using the common techniques of density functional theory .",
    "we have basically two different point defects to be studied : 1 ) a @xmath4 atom sitting substitutionally in a perfect @xmath5 diamond lattice , and 2 ) a single @xmath4 atom in a cage of six @xmath5 atoms that surround a double vacancy in the perfect diamond lattice .",
    "this cage has a long axis along the ( 111 ) direction , but it is not clear if the presence of the impurity inside the cage should modify this symmetry .",
    "the electronic energies depend on the local environment around the defect and the respective relaxation of the lattice , which involves changes in lattice parameter ( or cell volume ) and in the individual cell - atom positions .",
    "we have considered unit cells of different sizes around the point defect , in order to address these issues .    on one hand , we analized to what degree the energies and the lattice relaxation around the defect depend on the size of the cell , and estimated the elastic field caused by the defect . on the other hand",
    ", we studied more complex defect environments involving several @xmath4 impurities .",
    "we have considered unit cells of 8-atoms , as the ones studied in previous works  @xcite , as well as some larger cells , with 16 and 64 atoms , designed to better assess the preferred configurations when multiple defects are present .",
    "we have determined the defect energies per atom , relative to the pure @xmath5 and @xmath4 cohesive energy reference values , allowing _ full relaxation _ of the different cells studied with respect to the @xmath5 lattice ( i.e. allowing changes of lattice parameter and of individual positions of the atoms in the cell ) .",
    "specifically , for a unit cell consisting of @xmath17 @xmath5 atoms and @xmath18 @xmath4 atoms , we define the energy of the defect ( @xmath19 ) as the cohesive energy per atom : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the total energy of the fully relaxed cell with the defect , divided by the total number of atoms in the cell .",
    "@xmath22 and@xmath23 are the bulk @xmath5 and @xmath4 cohesive energies per atom , corresponding to perfect diamond lattices of @xmath5 and gray tin ( @xmath12-sn ) .",
    "we have also calculated the _ partially relaxed _ local defect energies @xmath24 per cell atom : fixing the cell volume at the value @xmath25 corresponding to bulk @xmath5 , allowing only relaxation of the positions of the individual atoms inside the cell .    in order to estimate the elastic field caused by the presence of the defect , we also determined the pressure exerted by each type of local defect on the lattice .",
    "this is obtained from the dependence of the total energy with the volume ( i.e. using partially relaxed energies at fixed cell volume @xmath26 ) .",
    "we define the pressure as : @xmath27 calculated at the unit cell volume which corresponds to bulk @xmath5 . in our convention , a positive pressure @xmath28 will mean that expansion of the lattice with respect to bulk @xmath5 is favoured .",
    "the numerical calculations were done using the full - potential linearized / augmented plane wave plus local orbital ( l / apw+lo ) method , as implemented in the wien2k code@xcite .",
    "the exchange - correlation effects were treated within the gga ( generalized gradient approximation ) using the perdew - burke - ernzerhof form @xcite .",
    "the radii of the muffin tin spheres ( @xmath29 ) were chosen to be 2.25 bohr for both @xmath5 and @xmath4 atoms .",
    "the cut - off parameter @xmath29-@xmath30 for limiting the number of the plane waves was set equal to 8 , with @xmath30 (= 8/2.25 = 3.55",

    "all atoms in the unit cell were allowed to fully relax independently and , except otherwise stated , also lattice parameter ( i.e. cell volume ) relaxation was allowed . in table",

    "this agrees with former ideas about the existence of two independent difficulties for the formation of homogeneous alloys , namely , the large size difference between @xmath5 and sn atoms with a 15@xmath11 lattice mismatch , and the d - bands which make gray tin unstable at room temperature ;  @xcite    \\v ) the energy of two @xmath8 defects increases when they are closer : indicating it would be difficult to form a homogeneous high concentration totally substitutional alloy ( due to the electronic energy cost ) .",
    "if , as generally mentioned before , strain was the only / main factor jeopardizing formation : x=0.5 zincblende ( @xmath62 ) should be easy to form , which is not the case .",
    "we used the valuable information from our electronic calculations of the previous section , to try to understand and predict the behavior of the alloy as a function of the @xmath4 concentration ( x ) . taking advantage of the fact that both experiments and calculations indicate a favourable substitutional incorporation of @xmath4 in the @xmath5 matrix for low concentrations",
    ", we could model the statistical behavior of the mixture during annealing to attain thermodynamical equilibrium by a stochastic approach . at low @xmath2 , defects containing only one @xmath4 atom are relevant .",
    "imagine a tetrahedral cage of @xmath5 atoms in which the central four - coordinated site could be occupied by either @xmath5 or @xmath4 , the former representing the perfect @xmath5 lattice ( @xmath65 ) while the latter represents an @xmath8 defect in @xmath5 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "by substitution of only one @xmath4 atom in any of the corners of the cage , one gets the @xmath67fold coordinated @xmath68pair defect studied in previous section.this @xmath67fold cage , which is the environment of a divacancy , could also be occupied by a single central @xmath4 atom , giving the non - substitutional @xmath3 defect studied in previous section ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the @xmath8 defect can be transformed by substitution of a single atom into the pair - defect , which becomes important only for larger @xmath2 . to keep the treatment to first order in @xmath2 , we approximate the pair defect by two separate @xmath8 defects , based on the fact that the numerical calculations of previous section indicate that the energy of the pair - defect @xmath70 is quite similar to twice the energy of one @xmath8 defect , @xmath71 .",
    "however , this energy difference will be taken into account below , when needed in the treatment .",
    "to first order in @xmath2 , there are only these three local configurations : @xmath72 , which form a complete closed set , in the sense that one can transform one into the other without leaving the set by substitution of a single atom .",
    "this allows one to formulate a dynamical process , representing the formation of the infinite solid by a large number of such one - step transformations encoded in a stochastic matrix ( which we will denote by @xmath73 ) .@xcite the elements of @xmath73 can be considered as the probabilities @xmath74 of obtaining configuration @xmath75 starting from configuration @xmath76 , and must contain all the physical information available . concretely , writing a one - step transformation as : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a vector whose three components represent the initial concentrations of each of the three configurations @xmath79 , therefore the sum of its three components equals one ( i.e. @xmath80 ) . in general , the final vector @xmath81 is different but its @xmath82 should be conserved .",
    "this is guaranteed by normalizing the columns of matrix @xmath73 to one , so that @xmath73 becomes a stochastic matrix .",
    "a well - known property of stochastic matrices is that one of their eigenvalues @xmath83 is equal to @xmath84 while all others have magnitudes which are less than @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) . after repeating the transformation @xmath17 times",

    "therefore , the elements of @xmath94 should be considered as the concentrations of the final configurations in the macroscopic system . for any arbitrary initial concentrations ,",
    "i.e. for any @xmath78 , under homogeneous formation conditions , one attains the fixed point : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the concentration of @xmath97defects in the sample ( and @xmath98 denotes the concentration of @xmath99defects ) .",
    "the transition probabilities @xmath100 ( @xmath101 are the required normalization factors ) are composed of three parts .",
    "a first factor is the conditional probability of obtaining configuration @xmath75 , starting from configuration @xmath76 , that is : @xmath102 .",
    "the second factor is a number counting all the possibilities of arranging the chemical bonds without changing the final results of the transition , and it could be interpreted as a sort of local configurational entropy . finally , the energy barriers to perform the transition should be considered . if the time scale for a chemical bond to reach thermal equilibrium is much smaller than the time it takes for the whole solid to equilibrate , then the third part can be written as a boltzmann factor containing the temperature of the bath . in our case",

    "notice that the pure @xmath5 dos does not have a gap at the fermi level , which is not a surprise due to inaccuracies at small energies around the fermi level of the approach gga - wien2k .",
    "another peculiar thing is the fact that deep down the valence band ( around -8ev ) , both pure systems present a single van hove singularity with zero dos corresponding to degeneracy of the bands at the @xmath128 point of the first brillouin zone of the fcc diamond structure .",

    "the wide gap in the density of states around those energies exhibited in zinc - blende @xmath62 is due to the removal of this degeneracy.@xcite of course , such features due to symmetry - breaking are not expected in the real crystalline alloys , since perfect order is not realized .",

    "these method applied to @xmath5 proved not to be straightforward , since a naive calculation considering @xmath130 orbitals is unable to reproduce essential features like the indirect band gap and the bandwidths .",
    "this is due to the mixing of @xmath131 electrons in the conduction bands of @xmath5 , which for @xmath7 or @xmath108 are not important , while for @xmath4 and @xmath132 are responsible for their metallic behavior .",
    "the role of @xmath131 electrons could be mimicked by introducing a pseudo - orbital ( @xmath133 ) without increasing the size of the tb hamiltonian .",

    "experiments in ge@xmath0sn@xmath1 alloys @xcite have indicated that the direct energy band gap decreases primarily through an increase in alloy concentration ( and applied coherency strain mainly reduces the valence band dos , instead of the magnitude of the gap ) .",

    "if , as it is usual in cpa , one uses the fixed lattice parameter corresponding to the perfect ( x=0 ) lattice at all concentrations , one finds that the trends with concentration are much smaller , if observable .",
    "for instance , the resulting valence band obtained is almost unchanged by concentration increases of up to 25@xmath11 , thus not reflecting the effect of the difference of bandwidths ( and shapes ) of the two alloy components . in this sense",
    "we have found that some improvement is gained by supplementing this effective field method with information on the structural changes undergone by the alloy as a function of concentration , considering that we found limitations of the traditional cpa description for ge@xmath0sn@xmath1 even at relatively low concentrations .    to better convey the information obtained by the fplo+cpa approach , in fig .",

    "our results show good agreement with the valence band @xmath138 and @xmath141 partial dos obtained by a previous lmto green function study.@xcite basically , the spectral weight of @xmath141 orbitals strongly dominates around the fermi level , while the @xmath138 orbitals are the most relevant at lower energies , for both species .",

    "[ cpa - dos - iii ] we exhibit an example of the problems encountered by cpa , based on the assumption that only substitutional @xmath8 impurities are present , which can not be overcome by taking into account the lattice parameter changes as a function of @xmath4 concentration . here",

    "[ cpa - dos-0to05 ] , consisting of the filling of the gap at the fermi level , is not valid at larger concentrations ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "contrary to expectations , the dos at the fermi level for pure @xmath4 is not the largest obtained for the alloy series .",
    "we believe that this provides a further indication of the presence of non - substitutional @xmath4 defects , and their relevance for a complete and consistent treatment of the problem .",
    "we have proposed a mechanism to understand the peculiar properties of ge@xmath0sn@xmath1 alloys .",
    "the main assumption is the existence of the @xmath3 defect , occupying a divacancy in the @xmath5 host , which imposes a severe strain in the lattice oppposite to the one caused by the @xmath8 substitutional defect .",
    "the other feature of the @xmath6 defect is that it causes a six - fold octahedral coordination on the @xmath4 atom , favouring the nucleation of white tin inclusions which eventually segregate .",
    "we demonstrate the plausibility of this assumption by performing ab - initio electronic calculations in supercells containing different local defects . starting from the single atom @xmath12 and @xmath6 defects , and increasing the number of @xmath4 atoms , in order to estimate : the electronic energy , the relaxed configuration around the defects , and the pressure caused by them .",
    "these studies suggest that the cubic octahedral symmetry is favoured in clusters containing few @xmath4 atoms , and that the electronic energy per atom is not very much increased by accumulating clusters of @xmath4 .",
    "the calculated pressures indicate that the large positive elastic field around these large defects may be released by the aggregation of @xmath6 defects , which have an opposite elastic field .",
    "we have observed that building up a local pressure in the lattice is not necessarily correlated with the electronic energy of the cluster .",
    "this is in agreement with former ideas @xcite that there are two independent reasons to account for the difficulties to form homogeneous ge@xmath0sn@xmath1 alloys , namely the electronic @xmath13bands which make gray @xmath8 unstable at room temperature and the large difference in the size of the atoms .",
    "we have also observed that the energy of two @xmath12 defects increases when they are closer together , also indicating that it would be very difficult to obtain a homogeneous alloy formed only by @xmath12 defects since their mean - distance would be smaller than a unit cell .",
    "notice , that if strain was the only factor jeopardizing formation , the @xmath149 zincblende compound should be easy to form , since it would be strain - free : but this is not the case .",
    "the knowledge gained by the local defect studies provided the basic ingredients to formulate a simple statistical model to investigate the relative concentration of @xmath12 and @xmath6 defects in thermal equilibrium as a function of the total @xmath4 concentration , @xmath2 .",
    "the model focuses on the dynamical evolution of few local configurations by using a stochastic matrix containing all the statistical information to calculate the transition between one configuration to another .",
    "the results show that , at room temperature , there are no @xmath6 defects present for @xmath150 .",
    "thus , our model supports the experimental finding that , at concentrations below 20@xmath11 , @xmath4 only enters substitutionally with a local tetrahedral environment .",
    "we find that the number of @xmath6 defects at a given concentration increases with temperature .",
    "we also found that the concentration at which @xmath6 defects start appearing decreases at larger temperatures .",
    "this suggests that one could obtain homogeneous alloys with higher @xmath4 content if one decreases the temperature of the thermal bath .",
    "this would mean , in the case of epitaxial growing by cvd or other techniques , that lowering the temperature of the substrate on which the alloy is grown favours the formation of homogeneous alloys at higher @xmath4 concentrations .",
    "this agrees with the experimental findings.@xcite in particular , we predict that @xmath149 homogeneous alloys would be possible to form at temperatures below -90@xmath119c .    in the last part of our work , we have tried to gain more insight into our problem by using effective - field methods in order to investigate the low concentration region in more detail .",
    "there , we found that tb+vca , while providing a good description of the substitutional - dominated regime , fails to predict the closing of the electronic gap at @xmath151 seen in experiments .",
    "furthermore , more sophisticated mean - field techniques as the cpa ( even using a combined ab - initio realistic bandstructure with the single - site substitutional cpa ) , does not provide much improvement .",
    "however , if one supplements the cpa by introducing the approximately linear concentration - dependence of the lattice parameter , obtained from our ab - initio local defect calculations ( in agreement with experiments ) , a slight improvement of the results is obtained .",
    "all this , further reinforces the hypothesis put forward in the present work . we think that an extension of the cpa @xcite able to take into account more complex defects , such as the non - substitutional @xmath6 defect , would certainly be extremely useful to improve the description of the electronic properties of these fascinating and useful alloys , and to study their effect on the large bowing of the direct band gap and the indirect to direct gap crossover.@xcite research along these lines is currently in progress .",
