    "` normal ' galaxies of all morphological types are known to be x - ray emitters , with luminosities in the soft ( @xmath93.5  kev ) x - ray band ranging from @xmath10 to some @xmath11 ergs s@xmath1 ( fabbiano 1989 ) . despite this band being a relatively small part of the electromagnetic spectrum and the x - ray output representing only a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity of a galaxy , x - ray observations are uniquely suited to studying various astrophysical phenomena elusive in other wavelength regimes . whereas the overall emission of a galaxy is dominated by stars in the optical and reprocessed stellar emission in the infrared , x - ray emission is primarily related to the high - energy phenomena associated with end - products of stars : accreting compact objects , supernova remnants , and the shock - heated hot interstellar medium .",
    "m81 ( table  [ parameters ] ) is an ideal test - bed for our understanding of the x - ray emission components in early - type spirals since it is the nearest such galaxy outside of the local group .",
    "it is located in a direction with relatively low galactic absorption ( @xmath12 ; dickey & lockman 1990 ) , considerably lower than that along the line - of - sight to m31 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "compared to the high disk inclination of m31 ( @xmath14 ) , the moderate inclination of m81 ( @xmath15 ) makes its emission components less obscured internally and easier to disentangle spatially .",
    "m81 hosts a low - luminosity seyfert nucleus with some characteristics of a low - ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) .",
    "the nucleus itself has been studied intensively in many wavelength regimes ( e.g. , ishisaki et al .",

    "1999 and references therein ) .",
    "more recently , the outburst of sn  1993j in m81 led to a large number of additional observations , especially in the x - ray band ( e.g. zimmermann et al .",
    "1994a ) .",
    "previous  observations of m81 resulted in the detection of nine individual x - ray sources including the nucleus , with luminosities in excess of @xmath16 ergs s@xmath1 in the 0.24.0  kev band ( fabbiano 1988 ) . only marginal evidence for variability",
    "was found for the nucleus and two other sources .",
    "about two - thirds of the non - nuclear emission was not resolved spatially .",
    "spectral and temporal properties of the m81 nucleus have been studied , based on both  and  data ( ishisaki et al .",

    "the spectrum of the nuclear source is well described by a power - law with a photon index @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , a softer component with a temperature of 0.60.8  kev was also detected .",
    "long - term x - ray variability of the m81 nucleus was found , with variations up to a factor of three over a period of 5.5 years , together with intra - day variability of 30% ( iyomoto & makishima 2000 ) .",
    "the spectral properties , together with the observed high variability , were regarded as being typical for a low - luminosity agn .",
    "the nature of the softer component , however , could not be specified .",
    "this paper reports on the results of deep x - ray observations of m81 obtained with the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) and the high resolution imager ( hri ) onboard  ( trmper 1983 ) .",
    "we focus mainly on the discrete x - ray source population inside the galaxy and the diffuse emission from the disk and the extended bulge of m81 . after a description of the x - ray observations and the data calibration (  [ obs ] ) ,",
    "we explain the data analysis strategies for the detection of discrete x - ray sources , their variability and the diffuse emission (  [ analysis ] ) .",

    "the pspc soft band is dominated by the local diffuse galactic background emission , and no additional source is detected .",
    "count rates may be converted into fluxes by assuming an x - ray spectral model .",
    "the x - ray spectra from galactic stars , snrs and hot gas observed in various emission regions within galaxies ( e.g. galactic halos , hii  regions or accretion of material onto a compact object ) can often be characterized as optically - thin thermal plasma with temperatures of a few @xmath38  k. agns typically show non - thermal emission , its soft x - ray band spectrum being described by a power - law with a photon index of @xmath39 . a reasonably good approximation of the conversion factor for these spectra is @xmath40 ( cf .",

    "the  data allow for time variability analysis of point sources on various time scales .",
    "we constructed lightcurves for all hri sources ( table  [ hri_sourcelist ] ) and performed statistical tests to check for variability . to achieve reasonable counting statistics , we binned the data into 15 observation blocks with @xmath49  ks exposure time each .",
    "furthermore , pspc lightcurves were constructed for the five brightest x - ray sources in the m81 field from 13 observation intervals with @xmath50  ks integration time each .",
    "the time - dependent background was determined by normalizing the total background map of the hri and pspc images according to the total source - removed count rate in each exposure interval .",
    "background subtracted source counts were extracted within the 90% radii around the fixed source positions found by the source detection algorithm .",
    "we tested the variability of each source by using a @xmath51 test . to verify the @xmath51 test ,",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test was performed on the unbinned lightcurves of all hri sources .",

    "the combined  hri and pspc lightcurves of the five brightest sources are given in fig .",

    "a substantial fraction of the x - ray emission from m81 can not be accounted for by the detected x - ray sources , but is confused by bright x - ray sources , especially the nucleus . for an effective point - like source subtraction , we compared the radial intensity profiles of sn  1993j in the merged hri image and lmc x-1 in an on - axis calibration observation ( obs .",

    ", m81 contains no giant hii  regions that may produce hot superbubbles energetic enough to blow out from spiral arms .",
    "furthermore , m101 is a nearly face - on galaxy .",
    "so the line - of - sight absorption is significantly smaller than in m81 and a better correlation between soft x - ray emission and spiral arms in m101 is expected .",
    "we thus conclude that the soft diffuse x - ray emission in m81 is also likely associated with recent massive star forming activities .",
    "we have systematically analyzed  pspc and hri observations of the early - type spiral m81 to disentangle different emission components and to derive spatial , spectral and timing characteristics of x - ray sources in the field .",
    "the main results and conclusions are as follows :    @xmath83 within a region of @xmath36 radius around the m81 nucleus , 69 pspc and 47 hri sources are detected .",
    "ten of them are found to be variable .",
    "eleven hri and nine additional pspc sources are likely foreground or background objects ( i.e. agn , quasars , galactic stars , etc . ) . excluding these interlopers and the nucleus , 26 x - ray sources are within the @xmath2 ellipse of the galaxy and",
    "have luminosities in the range of @xmath126 ",
    "@xmath127 ergs s@xmath1 in the 0.52  kev band .",
    "these sources account for @xmath4 of the total luminosity ( @xmath128 ergs s@xmath1 ) of the galaxy .",
    "@xmath83 we find an apparent association of luminous and variable x - ray sources with shock - heated optical nebulae .",
    "these sources are in the luminosity range of @xmath7@xmath8 .",
    "three position coincidences are with nebulae that are previously classified as snr candidates , and one with a nebula as a superbubble .",
    "these associations suggest that such ism structures may be powered by energetic outflows from x - ray binaries .",
    "@xmath83 x - ray emission is also detected from holmberg ix , the dwarf companion of m81 . assuming a distance ( 3.6  mpc ) similar to that of m81 , the inferred x - ray luminosity of ho ix is @xmath114 ergs s@xmath1 , which can be easily account for by a number of relatively young snrs and x - ray binaries .",
    "@xmath83 we present strong spatial and spectral evidence for the presence of an apparently diffuse x - ray component in m81 .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission is most prominent in the bulge region of the galaxy , although a fraction must arise in faint discrete stellar sources .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission fills much of the @xmath2 ellipse of m81 , accounting for @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ergs s@xmath1 ) of the total x - ray luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "a significant amount of x - ray emission may be absorbed by cool gas in the spiral arms .",
    "nevertheless , the similarity between the radial x - ray and uv intensity profiles and a comparison with m101 suggest that the diffuse x - ray emission is associated with recent massive star activities in m81 .",
