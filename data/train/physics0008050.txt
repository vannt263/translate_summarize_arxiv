    "in this paper we consider some starting points in the applications of a new numerical - analytical technique which is based on the methods of local nonlinear harmonic analysis ( wavelet analysis , generalized coherent states analysis ) to the quantum / quasiclassical ( nonlinear ) beam / accelerator physics calculations .",
    "the reason for this treatment is that recently a number of problems appeared in which one needs take into account quantum properties of particles / beams .",
    "we mention only two : diffractive quantum limits of accelerators ( achievable transverse beam spot size ) and the description of dynamical evolution of high density beams by using collective models [ 1 ] .",
    "our starting point is the general point of view of deformation quantization approach at least on naive moyal / weyl / wigner level ( from observables to symbols ) ( part 2 ) .",
    "then we present some useful numerical wavelet analysis technique , which gives the most sparse representation for two main operators ( multiplication and differentiating ) in any hilbert space of states .",
    "wavelet analysis is a some set of mathematical methods , which gives us the possibility to work with well - localized bases ( fig.1 ) in functional spaces and gives for the general type of operators ( differential , integral , pseudodifferential ) in such bases the maximum sparse forms .",
    "the approach from this paper is related to our investigation of classical nonlinear dynamics of accelerator / beam problems [ 2]-[10 ] .",
    "the common point is that any solution which comes from full multiresolution expansion in all time scales gives us expansion into a slow part and fast oscillating parts .",
    "so , we may move from coarse scales of resolution to the finest one for obtaining more detailed information about our dynamical process . in this way we give contribution to our full solution from each scale of resolution or each time scale .",
    "the same is correct for the contribution to power spectral density ( energy spectrum ) : we can take into account contributions from each level / scale of resolution . because affine group of translations and dilations ( or more general group , which acts on the space of solutions ) is inside the approach ( in wavelet case ) , this method resembles the action of a microscope .",
    "we have contribution to final result from each scale of resolution from the whole infinite scale of spaces . besides affine group symmetry , in part 3 we consider modelling , based on very useful and quantum oriented wigner transform / function approach ( corresponding to weyl - heisenberg group ) , which explicitly demonstrates quantum interference of ( coherent ) states .",
    "let us consider classical and quantum dynamics in phase space @xmath0 with coordinates @xmath1 and generated by hamiltonian @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath3 is ( classical ) flow then time evolution of any bounded classical observable or symbol @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the self - adjoint operators or quantum observables in @xmath8 , representing the weyl quantization of the symbols @xmath9 [ 12 ] @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 be the heisenberg observable or quantum evolution of the observable @xmath13 under unitary group generated by @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 solves the heisenberg equation of motion @xmath16.$ ] let @xmath17 is a symbol of @xmath15 then we have the following equation for it @xmath18 with the initial condition @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the moyal brackets of the observables @xmath21 , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the symbol of the operator product and is presented by the composition of the symbols @xmath24 @xmath25 for our problems it is useful that @xmath26 admits the formal expansion in powers of @xmath27 : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a multi - index , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "so , evolution ( 1 ) for symbol @xmath17 is @xmath32    at @xmath33 this equation transforms to classical liouville equation @xmath34 equation ( 2 ) plays a key role in many quantum ( semiclassical ) problem .",
    "our approach to solution of systems ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) is based on our technique from [ 11 ] and very useful linear parametrization for differential operators which we present now .",
    "let us consider multiresolution representation @xmath35 .",
    "let t be an operator @xmath36 , with the kernel @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xmath39 is projection operators on the subspace @xmath40 corresponding to j level of resolution : @xmath41 let @xmath42 is the projection operator on the subspace @xmath43 then we have the following `` microscopic or telescopic '' representation of operator t which takes into account contributions from each level of resolution from different scales starting with coarsest and ending to finest scales [ 13 ] : @xmath44 we remember that this is a result of presence of affine group inside this construction .",
    "the non - standard form of operator representation [ 13 ] is a representation of an operator t as a chain of triples @xmath45 , acting on the subspaces @xmath40 and @xmath43 : @xmath46 where operators @xmath47 are defined as @xmath48 the operator @xmath49 admits a recursive definition via @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 works on @xmath53 .",
    "it should be noted that operator @xmath54 describes interaction on the scale @xmath55 independently from other scales , operators @xmath56 describe interaction between the scale j and all coarser scales , the operator @xmath52 is an `` averaged '' version of @xmath57 .",
    "we may compute such non - standard representations of operator @xmath58 in the wavelet bases by solving only the system of linear algebraical equations .",
    "let @xmath59 then , the representation of @xmath60 is completely determined by the coefficients @xmath61 or by representation of @xmath60 only on the subspace @xmath62 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath63 satisfy the usual system of linear algebraical equations . for the representation of operator @xmath64 we have the similar reduced linear system of equations",
    ". then finally we have for action of operator @xmath65 on sufficiently smooth function @xmath66 : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is wavelet basis and @xmath69 are wavelet coefficients .",
    "so , we have simple linear parametrization of matrix representation of our differential operator in wavelet basis and of the action of this operator on arbitrary vector in our functional space .",
    "then we may use such representation in all quasiclassical calculations .",
    "according to weyl transform ( observable - symbol ) state or wave function corresponds to wigner function , which is analog of classical phase - space distribution .",
    "if @xmath70 satisfies the schroedinger equation @xmath71 and w is the wigner transform of @xmath72 @xmath73 then w satisfies the pseudo - differential ( @xmath72do ) wigner equation @xmath74    where @xmath72do operator @xmath75 is @xmath76\\cdot   \\big(\\int e^{iy\\xi}f(x,\\xi){\\mathrm{d}}\\xi\\big){\\mathrm{d}}y \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in quasiclassical limit @xmath77 the operator @xmath75 converges to @xmath78 .",
    "we consider it in [ 11 ] . on fig .  2 we present calculations [ 14 ] of wigner transform for beam motion , represented by four gaussians , which explicitly demonstrates quantum inteference in the phase space .",
