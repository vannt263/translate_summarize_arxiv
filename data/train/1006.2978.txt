    "dissipative fluid phenomena represent a number of challenges for relativistic physics .",
    "the main reason for this is the simple fact that the classic navier - stokes equations , which are not hyperbolic , allow instantaneous signal propagation .",
    "this is obviously not allowed in a relativistic description , where a model must respect causality in order to be considered acceptable .",
    "given the fundamental issues involved , it is not surprising that the problem of relativistic heat conduction continues to attract interest .",
    "the issues considered range from questions like `` does a moving body feel cold ? ''",
    "@xcite to issues of stability of models for non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite and whether different descriptions can be distinguished by experiment @xcite .    in the mainstream general relativity community",
    "the debate has , to some extent , been settled since the late 1970s .",
    "the key contribution was the work of israel and stewart , who developed a model analogous to grad s 14-moment theory , firmly grounded in relativistic kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "this so - called `` second order '' theory , which extends the pioneering `` first order '' work of @xcite , has since found applications in a number of contexts . in particular , in the last few years there has been a resurgence of interest in the model arising from the need to describe highly relativistic plasmas generated in colliders like rhic at brookhaven and the lhc at cern @xcite . however , despite the obvious successes of the israel - stewart model and its various attractive features there are still dissenting views in the literature , see for example @xcite .",
    "particular objections concern the complexity of the model and the large number of dissipation coefficients that are needed to complete it .",
    "this is , however , a feature that is shared by all models within the extended thermodynamics paradigm @xcite and it is difficult to see how a simpler model can be developed without sacrifice of causality or stability .",
    "our discussion is motivated by recent efforts to model the dynamics of superfluid neutron stars .",
    "this a problem that requires a general relativistic description of `` multi - fluid '' dynamics , and where thermal and dissipative effects are expected to impact on observations .",
    "work in this area is motivated by the effort to detect gravitational radiation , and the need to understand various oscillation instabilities in rotating neutron stars @xcite .",
    "these instabilities tend to be counteracted by viscosity and it is obviously important to have a quantitatively accurate description of the involved mechanisms .",
    "most studies of this problem have been carried out in newtonian gravity , basically because of a feeling that the relativistic problem is too `` complicated '' .",
    "there is , however , a growing body of work building towards realistic , fully relativistic , models .",
    "the present analysis should be viewed in that context .",
    "we are not providing a truly original view of the heat conduction problem .",
    "rather , we approach the issue within the multi - fluid paradigm that has been successfully applied to superfluid systems . a key ingredient in this analysis is the treatment of the entropy as an additional ( massless ) `` fluid '' component .",
    "this idea is obviously phenomenological , but we will show that it provides a model with a number of attractive features .",
    "most importantly , the formalism is intuitive and readily generalised to more complex settings .",
    "we build on the convective variational formulation developed by carter @xcite , see @xcite for an introductory review .",
    "in addition to the intrinsic elegance of an action principle , an appealing feature of the variational approach is that once an equation of state is provided the theory provides the relation between the various currents and their conjugate momenta ( a point that is usually not considered in the context of the heat problem ) .",
    "another key advantage of the variatiational derivation is that incorporating additional fluid components is straightforward .    in carter s macroscopic model for the heat problem one",
    "considers two fluxes , one corresponding to the matter flux and one which is associated with the entropy .",
    "these two currents are the fundamental fields appearing in the matter sector of the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "the lagrangian of the theory is a relativistic invariant and hence it should depend only on covariant combinations of the two fluxes , which includes the relative flow between them .",
    "this encodes the so - called entrainment effect , which tilts the momenta with respect to the currents when two or more fluids are coupled , and which turns out to be a crucial feature of the multi - fluid approach to relativistic heat conduction . in carter s original work @xcite",
    ", the aim was to keep the model as simple as possible by imposing restrictions on the way that the currents interact .",
    "on the grounds of simplicity carter ignored the entrainment .",
    "this omission resulted in a truncated model with severe stability issues @xcite .",
    "given this problem , it was suggested that carter s approach does not provide a viable alternative to the israel - stewart model .",
    "this argument is , however , flawed . a detailed comparison of the two formalisms @xcite shows that , at second order in the deviation from equilibrium , the full ( entrained ) variational approach is essentially equivalent to the israel and stewart model .",
    "an important aspect of the present work is that it extends the recent newtonian model of thermal dynamics discussed by @xcite to general relativity . in both cases",
    "entrainment has a fundamental impact on the dynamics of entropy .",
    "in fact , it is an essential ingredient that preserves causality and stability .",
    "both discussions lead to a generalization of the cattaneo equation @xcite and hence a finite speed of propagation of heat .",
    "an equivalent , although not identical equation arises in the israel and stewart theory .",
    "the difference between the two approaches is in the underlying thermodynamics .",
    "basically , the israel and stewart formalism is based on the standard equilibrium gibbs relation , and therefore the thermodynamic quantities take their equilibrium values . in contrast , the covariant dynamics of the variational approach leads naturally to an extended gibbs relation ( analogous to that in many models of extended irreversible thermodynamics ) , giving the thermodynamic quantities a different meaning . of course",
    ", the theories are completely equivalent in the case of thermal equilibrium .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ sec.tf ] provides the two - fluid variational derivation .",
    "the general philosophy that we adopt is that of @xcite .",
    "we obtain the equations of motion by imposing conservative constraints on the variations of the lagrangian density , but we use the explicit freedom in the equations of motion to include momentum exchange and entropy production while keeping the energy - momentum tensor divergence - free . once the equations of motion are obtained it is useful to make a choice of frame to discuss the thermodynamics and the gibbs relation .",
    "we discuss this point in detail , arguing why the choice that we make is natural .",
    "section [ sec.cat ] contains the derivation of the relativistic generalization of the cattaneo equation that follows once we impose the second law of thermodynamics . the result",
    "is then compared to the predictions of the israel and stewart model .",
    "the newtonian limit of the theory is obtained in section [ sec.newt ] , which establishes the close connection to the non - relativistic model of @xcite .",
    "the paper concludes with a brief discussion of the implications of the results , possible future extensions and applications .    throughout the paper we use the convention that 4-dimensional spacetime indices are represented by lowercase letters starting from the beginning of the alphabet , @xmath0 while 3-dimensional spatial indices are lowercase letters @xmath1 .",
    "there should be little risk of confusion .",
    "we denote the covariant derivative by a semi - colon .",
    "we consider the problem of heat conduction in general relativity at the macroscopic level .",
    "this means that we assume that the particle number is large enough that the fluid approximation applies and that there is a well defined matter current , @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , we adopt the multi - fluid formalism developed by @xcite and treat the entropy as an effective fluid with flux @xmath3 .",
    "this current is in general not aligned with the particle flux .",
    "the misalignment is associated with the heat flux and leads to entropy production .    for a generic two - fluid system ,",
    "the starting point is the definition of a relativistic invariant lagrangian - type _ master function _ @xmath4 . assuming that the system is isotropic , we take @xmath4 to be a function of the different scalars that can be formed by the two fluxes . from @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "we can form three scalars ; @xmath5 hence , we can write the master function as the density for the matter sector of the einstein - hilbert action ; [ eh ] s_m = ( n , s , j )  . an unconstrained variation of @xmath4 then leads to [ var1 ] = n + s + j  .    using  , we can change the passive density variations for dynamical variations of the worldlines generated by the fluxes and the metric @xcite .",

    "the distinct roles of the fluxes and their conjugate momenta are often not considered in the fluids literature .",
    "a key advantage of the variational approach is that the quantities are immediately determined by the form of the master function .",
    "moreover , it is clear that the momenta are not generally aligned with the respective currents , due to the fact that the master function depends on the relative flux .",
    "this is an important effect . fundamentally , there is no physical argument to rule out the dependence on @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , this coupling is associated with the entrainment effect that is known to be of central important in other multi - fluid systems .    in the case of superfluid",
    "neutron star cores the entraiment arises due to the strong interaction and couples the neutron and proton fluxes , see for example @xcite . in the present problem , with matter and entropy",
    ", we will show that the entrainment is associated with the thermal relaxation of the system .",
    "this is an important effect that must be accounted for .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is obtained from by noting that the displacements of the conserved currents induce a variation in the spacetime metric and therefore the variations of the fluxes , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are constrained , see @xcite for discussion .",
    "the energy - momentum is thus found to be [ se - tensor ] t_a^  b = _ a n^b + _ a s^b + _",

    "we note that , in order to obtain the energy momentum tensor we needed to impose the conservation of the fluxes as constraints on the variation .",
    "however , the equations of motion , and , still allow for non - vanishing production terms .",
    "if we , for simplicity , consider a single particle species , the matter current is conserved and we have [ divn ] n^a _  ; a = 0  .",
    "this removes the second term from the right - hand side of .",
    "in contrast , the entropy flux is generally not conserved .",
    "we will have [ divs ] s^a _  ; a = _ 0  , in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "this suggests that , to make progress , we need to connect the variational results with the relevant thermodynamical concepts . in doing this",
    "it makes sense to make a specific choice of frame .",
    "the conservation law implies that the force @xmath14 is orthogonal to the matter flux , @xmath2 , and therefore has only three degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , because of the force balance , we also have @xmath15 .",
    "this suggests that it is natural to focus on observers moving with the matter frame .",
    "we associate the matter current with a four - velocity @xmath16 such that n^a = n u^a , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the number density measured in this frame .",
    "historically , this is known as the eckart frame . as",
    "will soon become clear , this is the natural frame in the case of a single particle species , essentially because it simplifies the analysis .",
    "more complex settings , e.g. when dealing with additional particle species and reactions , will make the choice of frame less obvious .",
    "it may well be that the best strategy in such cases is to follow @xcite and work in the centre of mass frame .",
    "having said that , it is worth noting that even in the more general problem is there a unique frame associated with the entropy / heat flow .",
    "even though we will not discuss this problem further here , there are interesting issues that warrant more detailed thinking .",
    "having chosen to work in the matter frame , we can decompose the entropy current and its conjugate momentum into parallel and orthogonal components .",
    "the entropy flux is then expressed as s^a = s^ * ( u^a + w^a ) where @xmath19 is the relative velocity between the two fluid frames , and @xmath20 .",
    "letting @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the four - velocity associated with the entropy flux , we see that @xmath23 where = |u^a + w^a| = ( 1-w^2)^-1/2  , is the redshift associated with the relative motion of the two frames . in the following , we will use an asterisk to denote matter frame quantities .    similarly , we can write the thermal momentum as _ a = u_a + ^w_a = ( s^ *",
    "+ n ) u_a + s^ * w_a  , where we have made use of . from these expressions",
    "we readily obtain a measure of the temperature measured in the matter frame ; -u^a _ a = = s^ * + n  .",
    "[ tpar]in essense , this measure respresents the effective mass associated with the entropy component .",
    "we have also defined [ tperp ] ^= s^ *  .",
    "it is worth noting that , if we ignore the coupling between the fluxes in the master function by taking @xmath24 , then we have @xmath25 .",
    "this particular case was considered by @xcite , and from the analysis of @xcite we know that it leads to a model that exhibits instabilities .",
    "it is useful to keep this in mind during the following developments .",
    "as we will see , the main problem with carter s `` regular '' model is that it leaves no freedom to adjust the thermal relaxation timescale .    in order to express the energy - momentum tensor in terms of the matter frame quantities",
    ", we define the variables @xmath26 and @xmath27 . using the above expressions the stress - energy tensor can be written in a more familiar form ; t_ab = - u_a u_b + 2 u_(aq_b ) + p_ab  , where , making use of the projection orthogonal to the matter flux",
    "h_ab = g_ab + u_a u_b  , the heat flux ( energy flow relative to the matter ) is given by [ heat ] q_a = -h_abu_c t^bc = s^ * w_a  .",
    "we also have p_ab = h_ab + p_a _ b  .",
    "it is worth noting at this point that the variational analysis leads to the presence of `` shear '' terms in the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "such terms are usually associated with viscous stresses , and it is interesting to note that they arise even though we consider the pure heat conduction problem . moreover",
    ", this exercise shows that the energy density measured in the matter frame can be obtained by a legendre - type transform on the master function .",
    "that is , we have [ rhostar ] ^ * = u_a u_b t^ab = - + p_a ^a  .",
    "in fact , this relation informs the choice of @xmath28 and @xmath29 as key variables @xcite .",
    "thermodynamic properties such as pressure and temperature are uniquely defined only in equilibrium .",
    "intuitively this makes sense since , in order to carry out a measurement ( of say the temperature ) , the measuring device must have time to reach `` equilibrium '' with the system .",
    "the measurement is obviously only meaningful as long as the timescale required to obtain a result is shorter than the evolution time for the system .",
    "of course , this does not prevent a generalisation of the various thermodynamic concepts .",
    "the procedure may not be unique , but one should at least require the generalised concepts to be internally consistent within the chosen extended thermodynamics model . as a useful demonstration of this notion , and the fact that our model satisfies this criterion , we will consider the particular case of the temperature .",
    "when the system is out of equilibrium , we can define a number of different `` temperatures '' .",
    "it makes sense to refer to the quantity obtained from as the _ dynamical _ temperature since it corresponds to the _ effective mass _ of the entropy component .",
    "similarly , the effective mass for the particles , @xmath30 , is given by [ mu ] = - u^a _ a = n + s^ *  .",
    "let us now show that agrees with the _ thermodynamical _ temperature that an observer moving with the matter would measure . using the standard definition of temperature ,",
    "we consider the variation of the energy with respect to the entropy in the observer s frame ( while keeping the other thermodynamic variables fixed ) . to do this",
    ", we note that the energy density measured in the matter frame is a function of three independent state variables , @xmath31 .    determining the energy density directly from ,",
    "we get [ rhostar2 ] ^ * = n + s^ * -  .",
    "using the definitions , and we can evaluate the generalized pressure in the matter frame as a legendre - type transform of the master function ; ( , , p ) = + n + s^ * - p  , [ psi ] and so the variation of , ^ * = n",
    "+ s^ * + p  , [ envar ] shows that the dynamical temperature agrees with the thermodynamical temperature provided we evaluate it in the appropriate frame .",
    "we also see that , when the system is out of equilibrium , the energy variation depends on the heat flux ( encoded in @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "this _ extended _ gibbs relation is similar to that which is postulated in many approaches to extended thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the main difference here is that arises naturally from the variational analysis .",
    "this result is far from trivial .",
    "the requirement that the two temperature measures agree determines the additional state parameter , @xmath32 , to be held constant in the variation of @xmath33 .",
    "any other choice of the third parameter , e.g. @xmath9 , will lead to the determined temperatures being different and , hence , the model less consistent .",
    "additional evidence that we have identified natural parameters of the non - equilibrium problem is provided by the legendre transformations and .",
    "this important point was originally made by @xcite in a work that is not widely known .",
    "since the main part of our discussion concerns the dynamics of systems out of equilibrium , and the comparison of different possible models , it makes sense to make a few comments on the state of equilibrium . as usual , we take thermal equilibrium to mean that there is no heat flux . hence , we have @xmath34 and the entropy is carried along with the matter",
    ". it then makes sense to introduce the equilibrium quantities @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , evaluated in the matter frame , in terms of which we recover the standard gibbs relation ; = n + s  .    in equilibrium , both @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "are conserved which means that u^a _  ; a = - n = - s  , where = u^a n_;a  , and similar for @xmath38 .",
    "it is worth noting that if we introduce @xmath39 then we have = 0  .",
    "that is , the specific entropy remains constant in the matter frame .    by adding the momentum equations ",
    "we find that ( n+ s ) + h_a^b ( n _ ; b + s _ ; b ) = 0  .",
    "[ momtot]making use of the fundamental relation p + = n+ s  , where @xmath40 is the equilibrium pressure ( to be distinguished from the generalized pressure @xmath12 that is relevant also out of equilibrium ) , and p = n + s  , we have h_a^b = 0 ( p+ ) ^a = - h_a^b p_;b  . as expected , we have the usual relation between the acceleration and the pressure gradient .",
    "finally , the entropy momentum equation can be cast in the form ( the easiest way to see this is to set @xmath41 in the analysis that follows in the next section ) h^ab ( _ b + _ b ) = 0 ^a = - h_a^b _ ; b  . comparing these last two expressions we see that we must have h_a^b p_;b = 1 h_a^b _ ; b  .",
    "in other words , temperature changes lead to pressure variations and vice versa .",
    "it is well - known that the classic thermodynamics description leads to non - causal heat conduction .",
    "this is obvious if we consider the general solution to the heat equation corresponding to given initial data in an unbounded region of space .",
    "due to the parabolic nature of the heat equation , any initial profile evolves to predict a non - zero temperature throughout space , even at arbitrarily early times . to remedy this problem , and impose a maximal propagation speed for heat",
    ", @xcite proposed a modification to fourier s law such that the heat flux vector , @xmath42 , is related to the temperature gradient according to + * q * = -k t  .",
    "[ cat ] this model incorporates the ( finite ) thermal relaxation time @xmath43 expected to arise from the fact that , on the micro - physical scale , heat propagates due to particle collisions .",
    "cattaneo s equation leads to the temperature satisfying a telegraph - type equation whose hyperbolic nature leads to a finite propagation speed of heat pulses @xcite .    since any relativistic model must encode causal heat propagation",
    ", one would expect the heat flux to be described by an equation similar to .",
    "the anticipated form for the relativistic analogue of cattaneo s equation is , indeed , generally agreed upon but its derivation and the physical interpretation of the involved variables differ among proposed models .",
    "our main aim is to obtain the relevant heat conduction equation within the variational approach , and compare the result to the second order model of @xcite . in doing this , we will highlight the differences between the two models .",
    "we want to formulate a relativistic analogue of cattaneo s equation . the basic strategy will be to use the orthogonality of the entropy force density @xmath44 with the matter flux , solve for the entropy production rate @xmath45 and finally impose the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "let us first note that , by making use of we can express the entropy flux in terms of the matter flow and the heat flux ; [ sdecomp ] s^a= s^*u^a + q^a  .",
    "moreover , the conjugate momentum becomes [ thetadec ] _ a = u_a + q_a  , where @xmath46 is given by [ beta ] = ( + ) = ( - )  .",
    "it is worth noting that if we set @xmath24 , as in carter s `` regular '' model @xcite , then @xmath46 takes the specific value @xmath47 .    in terms of the variables",
    "we have introduced we have s^a _  ; a = 2_[a;b]u^a q^b  , which leads to the entropy creation rate _ = s^a _  ; a = -q^a ( _ ; a + u_a - q_c;au^c + q_a + _ ; c u^c q_a )  .",
    "[ gams ] dots represent time derivatives in the matter frame , as before .",
    "that is , @xmath48 is the four - acceleration and ^a = u^b q^a _  ; b  , represents the time variation of the heat flux .",
    "the expression given in has to satisfy the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the simplest way to achieve this is to demand that the entropy production is a quadratic in the sources .",
    "this suggest that the heat flux takes the form [ precat ] q^a = -h^ab ( _  ; b + u_b + 2q_[b;c]u^c + q_b ) where @xmath49 is the thermal conductivity of the fluid .",
    "this leads to a relativistic analogue to cattaneo s equation , which can be written [ cattaneo ] 2q^[a;c]u_c + q^a = -h^ab ( _  ; b + u_b )  , or [ gato ] ( ^a + q_c u^c;a ) + q^a = -h^ab ( _  ; b + u_b )  , where we have used the fact that @xmath50 . moreover , we have introduced the effective thermal conductivity @xmath51 ;  , and the thermal relaxation time =  .",
    "it is worth noting that , if @xmath46 varies on a timescale @xmath52 ( say ) which is long compared to the thermal relaxation , then 1  .",
    "one would expect this to be the case in most situations of practical interest .",
    "thus , we would simply have  ,  .      before we proceed to compare to the corresponding equation obtained within the @xcite approach , it is worth considering the variational result from a slightly different point of view . as in the newtonian problem @xcite",
    ", the entropy momentum equation provides an evolution equation for the heat flux .",
    "this equation can be written in a number of ways , some of which are helpful in interpreting the results .",
    "as a first step , we recall that @xmath53 is orthogonal to @xmath16 . by contracting with @xmath16 and using the result in we arrive at an elegant expression for the force @xmath53 ; -^ * f^_a = 2 u^c s_b ( _ [ c _",
    "; b + _ b[;c _ a ] ) [ cato1 ] written in this form , the force is clearly orthogonal to @xmath16 . moreover , this expression emphasises the relevance of the entropy momentum @xmath54 .",
    "however , if we want to gain insight into the key factors that contribute to the force then we need to expand this expression . to do this , we contract equation with to get [ qdec ] ( s^a _ a)_= s^af_a^= q^a f_a^  .",
    "this shows that the entropy production only depends on the piece of the force @xmath53 which is parallel to the heat flux . in general",
    ", we can decompose the entropy force into two terms ; f_a^= f^q_a + f_a^  , where both pieces are orthogonal to @xmath16 , and @xmath55 is also orthogonal to @xmath56 . from it",
    "is obvious that @xmath55 can not contribute to the entropy production .",
    "hence , this term is not constrained by the second law .",
    "this is an important point because there is no obvious way to distinguish the viability of models with different forms of @xmath55 .",

    ", this term has no counterpart in the newtonian problem .",
    "however , its presence in the relativistic heat equation has been known since the pioneering work of @xcite .",
    "formally , this term originates from the local energy balance , .",
    "physically , it results from the fact that the infinitesimal 3-spaces orthogonal to the matter world lines are not parallel , but relatively tipped over because of the curvature of the world line .",
    "this leads to the interpretation of the four - acceleration contribution in terms of the effective inertia of heat @xcite .",
    "interestingly , @xcite have recently suggested that this term may be the origin of instabilites .",
    "we will not discuss this suggestion in detail , but note that there are varying points of view in this area of research .",
    "most researchers seem to accept that the four acceleration term is both inevitable and physically meaningful .",
    "the derivation of was based on the thermal momentum equation .",
    "we could , in principle , also make use of the other momentum equation , . contracting this equation with @xmath3 we have - q^2 f^= n q^a  , where = 1 - s^",
    "* n = ^ *  .",
    "this gives us an expression for @xmath61 which could be used in .",
    "we would then arrive at a different form for @xmath45 and as a result , the cattaneo equation will also be different .",
    "the four acceleration term will now be replaced by the chemical potential gradient . after some algebra , we arrive at @xmath62}\\right\\ }   \\ .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] we could impose the second law on this result , and hence derive an alternative form for the cattaneo equation .",
    "there is , however , no obvious reason why this form would be more useful than .",
    "hence , we will not pursue this strategy further here .",
    "the most successful approach to the problem of causal heat conductivity and dissipation in relativistic fluid dynamics is due to israel and stewart @xcite .",
    "a detailed comparison between their results and the variational model has already been carried out by @xcite .",
    "the key results of this comparion are : i ) the two models differ only at second order in the deviation from equilibrium , ii ) the inclusion of entrainment , @xmath63 , is essential in the variational analysis .",
    "iii ) the two models belong to a larger class on non - equilibrium thermodynamics models .",
    "we will demonstrate these results in the particular case of pure heat conductivity .",
    "priou s analysis includes the viscosity contributions from @xcite , which makes many of the equations rather complex .",
    "the message is clearer if we focus on the heat conductivity problem , and we feel that it is important to make the comparison as transparent as possible .    in order to effect the comparison , it makes sense to begin by working through the derivation of the israel - stewart model for a heat conducting system .",
    "we focus on the phenomenological description , and simply note that the model has a firm foundation in relativistic kinetic theory .",
    "hence , we take as the starting point the stress - energy tensor @xcite ; [ stress ] t^ab = u^a u^b + ( p + ) h^ab + 2 u^(aq^b ) + ^ab the main difference from the variational model is that the thermodynamical quantities refer to an equilibrium state . as before , @xmath35 is the energy density , @xmath40 is the pressure and @xmath56 is the heat flow orthogonal to the matter flow .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath64 and @xmath43 are the stresses caused by viscosity in the fluid .",
    "the tensor @xmath64 satisfies the relations [ ort1 ] 0 = u^a _ ab= ^a _  a=_[ab ]  .",
    "motivated by kinetic theory , israel and stewart expands the entropy flux to include a complete set of second order terms [ sisrael ] s^a_i = s n^a + - ( _ 0 ^2 + _ 1 q^b q_b + _ 2 _ bc^bc ) + _ 0 + _ 1  . here",
    ", @xmath65 is the absolute temperature associated with the equilibrium state and the coefficients @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 correspond to different couplings that need to be provided ( i.e. obtained from the microphysics of the problem ) . by neglecting all viscosity contributions",
    "we are left only with the @xmath67 term , and the entropy flux reduces to [ sisr02 ] s^a_i = s n^a + q^a - q^2 u^a .    from this definition",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the divergence of @xmath71 to impose the second law . from the equations of motion we also have [ n59 ] u_b t^ab _  ; a = - - ( + p ) u^a _  ; a - q^a _  ; a + q_b u^b = 0  .",
    "we now use the fundamental relation of thermodynamics in the equilibrium form p + = n + s t  , together with the equilibrium equation of state , @xmath72 , which leads to _ ; a = n_;a + t s_;a  .",
    "we also need to use the fact that the flux @xmath2 is conserved .    combining these results",
    ", we arrive that s^a_i;a = - q^b  . as before ,",
    "we need to ensure that the entropy production is positive .",
    "this follows as long as [ iscat ] q^a = - t h^ab  .",
    "this relation provides the israel - stewart version of the relativistic cattaneo equation .    as in the variational case",
    ", one may add other terms to the heat flux as long as they do not lead to the generation of entropy .",
    "as an example , @xcite included the term -_2",
    "t h^abq^c u_[c;b ]  , the presence of which is motivated by kinetic theory .",
    "this term is clearly orthogonal to both @xmath56 and @xmath16 and , hence , does not affect @xmath45 . technically , it is also a second order term because the fluid shear is associated with the viscosity .",
    "we have reached the point where we can compare the final equations for the heat flux from the variational approach , eq .",
    ", to the israel - stewart model , eq .  .",
    "however , before we do this , let us consider the problem from the `` extended irreversible thermodynamics '' point of view .",
    "this approach , which was first developed by @xcite , provides an immediate illustration of the fundamental difference between the two models that we are discussing .    as in the variational analysis , we take the heat flux to be given by s^a = s^ * u^a + q^a  .",
    "the corresponding stress - energy tensor is t^ab= ^ * u^a u^b + 2u^(aq^b ) + h^ab + ^a p^a  , where @xmath12 denotes the ( generalised ) pressure , and the variation of the energy density ( in the matter frame ) is ^ * =",
    "n + ^ * s^ * + p  . obviously , we are now refering to out - of - equilibrium quantities .",
    "hence , we use an _ extended _ gibbs relation that accounts for the heat flux .",
    "this immediately leads to ^ * _  ; a = n_;a + ^ * s^ * _  ; a + ( q)_;a  .    using these relations and the particle conservation",
    ", we find that u_bt^ab _  ; a = ( n- ^ * - ) - ^ * s^ * - p + q_b;au^bu^a - q^a _  ; a + p^b _  ; a^a u_b  . at this point",
    "we need the fundamental relation , which allows us to complete the derivation .",
    "we arrive at s^a _  ; a = -q^b  , which is identical to .",
    "hence , the heat flux will ( again ) be governed by .",
    "since the two approaches are based on different strategies , any comparison between the variational model and the israel - stewart results must be done carefully .",
    "notably , the israel - stewart model is based on an expansion including terms up to second order in the deviation from equilibrium .",
    "meanwhile , the variational analysis did not involve such an expansion . as a result ,",
    "the final equation for the heat flux , , contains higher order terms while is manifestly linear in @xmath56 .    in order to compare the results",
    ", it makes sense to focus on the linear deviation from equilibrium .",
    "then we have ^ * = t + o ( q^2 )  , and it follows that can be approximated by ( ^a + q_c u^c;a ) + q^a -h^ab(t _  ; b + tu_b )  . here",
    "it is worth noting that in the second term in the first bracket we could use the standard decomposition of @xmath73 in terms of the shear , expansion etcetera .",
    "this would lead to terms that were explicity excluded from the israel - stewart model at the point where we focussed on the case with @xmath74 .",
    "basically , the variational analysis leads to the presence of terms that couple the heat flux to the shear and expansion of the flow . as these were artificially excluded from the analysis that led to we can not count this as a difference between the two models .",
    "in fact , the full comparison carried out by priou show that these terms agree in the two descriptions .",
    "keeping terms up to second order ( treating the shear and the divergence of @xmath16 as first - order quantities ) , can be written _",
    "i ^a + q^a -_i h^ab(t _  ; b + tu_b )  , where _ i = _ 1 t ^-1  , and _",
    "i = ^-1  .",
    "now it is clear that the two equations for the heat flux are formally identical , and we can `` identify '' the parameters in the two models . the upshot of this is that , the models will only produce different results at higher order deviations from equilibrium . given that this regime is hardly tested at all , we can not at this stage comment on which of the two descriptions ( if either ) may be the most appropriate .",
    "having said that , it is clear that the variational approach is formally elegant and the fact that it applies also far from equilibrium ( at least in principle ) may be relevant .",
    "an interesting question concerns whether there are situations where the , rather specific , set of higher order terms predicted by the variational analysis affect the nonlinear dynamics .",
    "before we conclude the comparison , it is worth noting that the difference between the two models was apparent already from the beginning .",
    "this is clear if we consider the stress - energy tensor . in the variational case we have t_ab= ^ * u_a u_b + 2 q_(au_b ) + h_ab + p_a _ a  . comparing this",
    "to we see that = 1 3 ( s^*)^2 ^w^2 and _",
    "ab = 3(s^*)^2 ^ ( w_a w_b - h_ab w^2 ) these terms are quadratic in @xmath19 ( that is , @xmath56 ) .",
    "hence , it is obvious that , in order to carry out detailed a comparison we ought to include also shear- and bulk viscosity in the model , c.f . the analysis of @xcite .",
    "having developed a model for heat conductivity in general relativity , and discussed the results in the context of the well - established israel - stewart model , we should also consider the implications of the model for non - relativistic systems .",
    "the close connection between the variational multi - fluid approach in newtonian gravity and extended irreversible thermodynamics has already been discussed by @xcite .",
    "the results demonstrated that a two - fluid model based on a massive component representing the particles and a massless component representing the entropy , reproduces many key results from the literature @xcite .",
    "in particular , the non - relativistic cattaneo equation is obtained immediately from the momentum conservation law for the entropy .",
    "the non - relativistic analysis is , in fact , completely analogous to the discussion in this paper . to demonstrate this , and relate the two models , we will now work out the newtonian , low - velocity , weak gravity , limit of our main equations .",
    "let us first return to the variation of the master function @xmath4 .",
    "assuming low velocities we have j^2 = -n^a s_a sn ( 1 + w^2 2c^2 )  , where @xmath75 represents the ( squared ) magnitude of the relative velocity between matter and entropy ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "note that we need to keep the speed of light , @xmath77 , explicit in this discussion .",
    "this then leads to dj^2 s ( 1 + w^2 2c^2 ) dn + n ( 1 + w^2 2c^2 ) ds + sn 2c^2 dw^2  , and d- dn - ds - sn 2c^2 ^ dw^2  .    to make progress it is essential to appreciate that the newtonian limit is singular , see for example the rigorous analysis of @xcite . in order to effect a direct `` calculation '' it is useful to separate the `` ballistic '' rest - mass contribution to the master function .",
    "that is , we use ( recalling that the entropy is taken to be massless ) = - m n c^2 - e(n , s , w^2 )  . from the above results it follows that .",

    "these three relations allow us to express @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 in terms of the newtonian coefficients @xmath30 , @xmath65 and @xmath78 .",
    "we also need the weak field spacetime metric . to the required order",
    ", we have the line element ds^2 - c^2 ( 1 + 2 c^2 ) dt^2 + g_ij dx^i dx^j  , where @xmath82 is the gravitational potential and @xmath83 is the flat space metric . meanwhile , the four velocities have components u_^t = 1- c^2 + v_^2 2c^2  , u_^i = v_^i  , and u_^t",
