    "in linear algebra it is frequently necessary to use non - linear objects such as minimal and characteristic polynomials since they encode fundamental information about endomorphisms of finite - dimensional vector spaces .",

    "consequently , it not surprising that minimal and characteristic polynomials can be successfully used to detect properties of  @xmath3 .",
    "this point of view was taken systematically in the new book  @xcite where the particular importance of minimal polynomials ( rather greater than that of characteristic polynomials ) emerged quite clearly .",
    "the book also described several algorithms which use minimal polynomials as a crucial tool .",
    "the approach taken there was a good source of inspiration for our research , so that we decided to dig into the theory of minimal polynomials , their uses , and their applications .",
    "the first step was to implement algorithms for computing the minimal polynomial of an element of @xmath3 and of a @xmath2-endomorphism of  @xmath3 ( see algorithms  [ alg : minpolyquotelim ] , [ alg : minpolyquotmat ] , [ alg : minpolyquotdef ] ) .",
    "they are described in section 3 , refine similar algorithms examined in  @xcite , and have been implemented in ( see  @xcite and @xcite ) as indeed have all other algorithms described in this paper .",
    "sections  [ reductions of ideals ] and  [ modularapproach ] constitute a contribution of decisive practical significance : they address the problem of computing minimal polynomials of elements of a @xmath5-algebra using a modular approach . as always with a modular approach ,",
    "various obstacles have to be overcome ( see for instance the discussion contained in  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , we deal with the notion of reduction of an ideal modulo @xmath6 , and we do it by introducing the notion of @xmath7-denominator of an ideal ( see definition  [ reductionmodp ] and theorem  [ thm : rgbp ] ) , which enables us to overcome the obstacles . then ugly , usable , good and bad primes show up ( see definition  [ def : usableprime ] and [ def : goodprime ] ) . fortunately , almost all primes are good ( see theorem  [ almostallgood ] and corollary  [ cor : badprimes ] ) which paves the way to the construction of the fundamental algorithm  [ alg : modular ] .",
    "section 6 presents non - trivial examples of minimal polynomials computed with , and section 7 shows how minimal polynomials can be successfully and efficiently used to compute several important invariants of zero - dimensional affine @xmath2-algebras .",
    "more specifically , in subsection  [ isradical and radical ] we describe algorithms  [ alg : isradical0dim ] and [ alg : radical0dim ] which show how to determine whether a zero - dimensional ideal is radical , and how to compute the radical of a zero - dimensional ideal . in subsection  [ ismaximal ] we present several algorithms",
    "which determine whether a zero - dimensional ideal is maximal or primary .",
    "the techniques used depend very much on the field @xmath2 .",
    "the main distinction is between small finite fields and fields of characteristic zero or big fields of positive characteristic . in particular , it is noteworthy that in the first case frobenius spaces ( see section  5.2 of  @xcite ) play a fundamental role .    finally , in section  [ primary decomposition ]",
    "a series of algorithms ( see  [ alg : pdsplitting ] , [ alg : pdsplittingchar0 ] , [ alg : primarydecompositioncore ] , and [ alg : primarydecomposition0dim ] ) describe how to compute the primary decomposition of a zero - dimensional affine @xmath2-algebra .",
