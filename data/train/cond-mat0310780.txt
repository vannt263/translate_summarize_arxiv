    "the study of the superfluid properties of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) trapped in periodic potentials are attracting a fast growing interest .",
    "the main reason is that the control parameters of such systems are widely tunable in realistic experiments , allowing for the investigation of different and fundamental issues of quantum mechanics , ranging from quantum phase transitions @xcite and atom optics @xcite to the dynamics of bloch and josephson oscillations @xcite .",
    "several efforts are also focusing on the realization of new technological devices as bec interferometers working at the heisenberg limit @xcite , and quantum information processors @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of becs in lattices is highly non - trivial , essentially because of the competition / interplay between the _ discrete _ translational invariance of the periodic potential and the _ nonlinearity _ arising from the interatomic interactions . for deep enough optical potentials ,",
    "interactions induce a quantum transition from the superfluid to a mott - insulator phase @xcite . in this work",
    "we will study the system in a region of parameters such that its ground state stands deeply in the superfluid phase , with the dynamics governed by the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) . because of the discrete translational invariance",
    ", the excitation spectrum of the system exhibits a band structure which has several analogies with the electron bloch bands in metals @xcite . on the other hand , the coexistence of bloch bands and nonlinearity allows , for instance , solitonic structures @xcite and dynamical instabilities @xcite which do not have an analog neither in metals , nor in galilean invariant systems .    exact , time - dependent solutions of the gpe with an external periodic potential , eq.([gpe ] ) , can be written as bloch states , namely as plane waves modulated by functions having the same periodicity of the lattice .",
    "the dynamics of small amplitude perturbations on top of these states satisfies two coupled , linear bogoliubov equations , which can be solved numerically .",
    "however , when the interwell barriers of the periodic potential are high enough , the system can be described in a nonlinear tight binding approximation and several important properties of the system can be retrieved analytically @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the nonlinear tight binding approximation the continuous gross - pitaesvkii equation can be replaced with a discrete nonlinear equation ( dnl ) , eq.([dnls_gen ] ) , where the relevant observables of the system are the number of particles @xmath0 trapped in well @xmath1 and the relative phases @xmath2 . in this paper , we rewrite the results derived in @xcite in a more convenient form , namely in terms of _ two _ effective masses and group velocities . furthermore , we compare our analytical expressions with full numerical solutions , and we extend our analysis to investigate the behaviour of the system at low optical potential depths , where the nonlinear tight binding approximation breaks down .",
    "we show that the phenomena predicted by the dnl equation ( [ dnls_gen ] ) can be generalized to the case of shallow potentials , bringing new insights on the dynamics of the system .",
    "in the  classical \" ( mean field ) approximation , the bec dynamics at @xmath3 is governed by the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite    @xmath4 \\psi({\\vec r},t)= \\mu   \\psi({\\vec r},t),\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the atomic mass and @xmath7 the @xmath8-wave scattering length : @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) corresponds to an effective interatomic repulsion ( attraction ) . in the following",
    "we consider only a bec with repulsive interatomic interactions .",
    "the external potential @xmath11 includes the optical periodic potential @xmath12 , which is typically superimposed to an harmonic ( or linear ) potential @xmath13 .",
    "the periodic potential is    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the lattice spacing and @xmath16 is the wavevector of the lasers in the lattice direction .",
    "the lattice spacing determines the bragg momentum    @xmath17    corresponding to the boundary of the first brillouin zone .",
    "the energy barrier between adjacent sites is expressed in units of the recoil energy @xmath18 . from ( [ laser_potential ] )",
    "we see that the minima of the laser potential are located at the positions @xmath19 ( @xmath1 is an integer ) . around these points , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",
    "the harmonic potential is @xmath22/2 $ ] .",
    "since , typically , @xmath23 , it is convenient to write the external potential as @xmath24 , where the lattice potential @xmath25/2 $ ] includes the transverse confining field , and the  driving \" field @xmath26 gives the effective force acting on the center of mass of the condensate wave packet .    in order to understand the basic physics of the system ,",
    "we first consider the case of deep optical lattices , where analytic solutions can be obtained in the tight binding approximation .",
    "then we study the behaviour of the system beyond the tight binding limit , solving numerically the gross - pitaevskii and bogoliubov equations with arbitrarily shallow periodic potentials .    as it has been previously shown in @xcite ,",
    "when the interwell barriers are much higher than the chemical potential , it is possible to write the condensate wavefunction as    @xmath27    where the wannier wavefunctions @xmath28 are well localized in each well .",

    "the dependence of the local chemical potential on the number of atoms is affected by the effective dimensionality of the condensates trapped in each well of the lattice .",
    "this can be determined comparing the interaction chemical potential @xmath46 and the three frequencies , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 obtained expanding the lattice potential around the minima of each well @xmath50/2 $ ] .",
    "for instance , when @xmath51 , the spatial width of each trapped condensate does not depend ( in first approximation ) on the number of particles @xmath33 in the same well , and the condensate wavefunction in each valley of the periodic potential is well approximated by a gaussian . we consider this as a @xmath52 ( zero - dimensional ) case : then , the nonlinear tight binding approximation ( [ tb_gen ] ) reduces to the usual tight binding approximation @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath54 case arises when two frequencies are larger than the interaction chemical potential . in this case",
    "the system realizes an array of weakly coupled cigar - shaped condensates , with @xmath28 factorized as gaussians along the two tight directions and a thomas - fermi in the other direction . in the @xmath55 case",
    "only one frequency is smaller than the local interaction chemical potential : we have an array of pancake - like condensates , with @xmath28 factorized as a gaussian along the tight direction and a thomas - fermi in the two other directions .",
    "the @xmath56 case is given by the condition @xmath57 and the wavefunction in the @xmath1th well @xmath28 is simply given by a three - dimensional thomas - fermi function .",
    "the crucial point is that the effective dimensionality of the condensates gives a different scaling of the local interaction chemical potential ( [ mu ] ) with the number of atoms    @xmath58    with @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , @xmath34 is the number of atoms in well @xmath1 , and @xmath61 is a constant which does not depend on the number of atoms nor on the site index . when @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the dnl equation ( [ dnls_gen ] ) gives the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "in this section we derive the bloch and the bogoliubov excitation spectra of the system in absence of any driving field ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "first we derive our results analytically in the tight binding approximation ; then we solve the equations numerically for a wide set of parameters to extend our treatment beyond the tight binding regime .      the bloch states @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is periodic with period @xmath15 , are exact stationary solutions of the gross - pitaevskii equation ( [ gpe ] ) .",
    "both the energy per particle @xmath67 ( bloch energy ) and the chemical potential @xmath68 of such solutions form a band structure , so that they can be labeled by the quasi - momentum @xmath69 and the band index @xmath70 .",
    "the dnl equation ( [ dnls_gen ] ) describes only the lowest band of the spectrum ( in the following , we will consider only the lowest band @xmath71 , and we will omit , for simplicity , the band index @xmath70 ) .",
    "exact solutions of the dnl equation are the `` plane waves '' @xmath72 , where @xmath69 is the quasi - momentum , and @xmath1 is the site index ( note that the @xmath73 are plane waves in the discrete @xmath1-space , but do not correspond to plane waves in real space ) . within the dnl equation framework , the energy per particle @xmath74 and chemical potential @xmath75 corresponding to these solutions are    @xmath76    where @xmath77 , with @xmath78 the number of atoms per well and @xmath79 . in the previous equations we have introduced the effective masses @xmath80 and @xmath81 , to emphasize the low momenta ( long wavelength ) quadratic behaviour of the bloch energy spectrum and of the chemical potential @xcite .",
    "it turns out that several dynamical properties of the system can be intuitively understood in terms of such effective masses .",
    "this approach is quite common , for instance , in the theory of metals , where @xmath82 .",
    "however in bec , because of the nonlinearity of the gross - pitaevskii equation , the two relevant energies of the system , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , have the same @xmath85 dependence on the quasi - momentum @xmath69 , but different curvatures .",
    "therefore , @xmath86 , with    @xmath87    where @xmath88 and @xmath40 have been defined in eqs.([kappa],[chi ] ) . sometimes it is convenient to extend the definition of the effective masses to the full brillouin zone , introducing the quasi - momentum dependent masses    @xmath89^{-1 }   = { m_\\varepsilon \\over   \\cos(\\pi p / q_b ) } , \\\\ & & m_\\mu ( p ) \\equiv   \\left [ { { \\partial^2 \\mu } \\over { \\partial p^2}}\\right]^{-1 }   =    { m_\\mu \\over   \\cos(\\pi p / q_b)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , following eqs.([m_e],[m_mu ] ) , @xmath90 and @xmath91",
    ".    it is also useful to introduce , with the same line of reasoning , two different group velocities , defined as    @xmath92    there is a simple , general relation between the two different group velocities ( following from @xmath93 )    @xmath94    with , given eqs.([m_e],[m_mu ] ) , @xmath95 . the analog relation for the effective masses has been retrieved in @xcite .    of course , the concept of _ effective mass _ , defined as the inverse of the curvature of the corresponding spectrum ( as that of _ group velocity _ , defined as the first derivative ) can be extended to shallow optical potentials , where the nonlinear tight binding approximation breaks down . in this case",
    ", the quasi - momentum dependence of @xmath83 and @xmath84 will not be simply described by a cosine function , but will still remain periodic in the quasi - momentum @xmath69 . in particular , the value @xmath69 where @xmath96 changes sign ( corresponding to @xmath97 ) will be greater than @xmath98 and will in general not coincide with the momentum where @xmath99 changes sign ( corresponding to @xmath100 ) .",
    "the presence of the two _ different _ effective masses ( group velocities ) raises an important problem : which effective mass ( group velocity ) , and how , enters in the dynamical properties of the system ?",
    "for instance , we anticipate that the current carried by a bloch waves with quasi - momentum @xmath69 is @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the average particle density ; @xmath81 , on the other hand , plays a crucial role in the bogoliubov spectrum .",
    "to conclude this subsection , we notice that the bloch states are not the only stationary solutions of the gross - pitaevskii equation .",

    "such difference becomes important when the condensate moves with a large quasi - momentum , as shown in fig .",

    ", this corresponds to a group velocity larger than the sound velocity ( landau criterion for superfluidity ) . when the system has a discrete translational invariance ( @xmath146 ) the condition for this instability is obtained from the bogoliubov excitation spectrum eq.([omega ] ) .",
    "then , we have that the system is not superfluid when @xmath147 , corresponding to    @xmath148    this result should be compared with the well known landau criteria for an homogeneous system ( @xmath149 ) , stating that the superfluid is energetically unstable when @xmath150 , @xmath151 being the group velocity of the condensate , and @xmath152 the sound velocity .    there is a further dynamical ( modulational ) instability mechanism associated with the appearance of an imaginary component in the bogoliubov frequencies , which disappears in absence of interatomic interactions , or in the translational invariant limit ( if @xmath153 ) .",
    "the onset of this instability in the tight binding regime , coincides with the condition    @xmath154    the dynamical instability drives an exponentially fast increase of the amplitude of the ( initially small ) fluctuations of the condensate . since the initial phases and amplitudes of the fluctuation modes are essentially random , their growth induce a strong dephasing of the condensate , and dissipates its translational kinetic energy ( which is transformed in incoherent collective and single particles excitations ) .",

    "\\label{t_mi}\\ ] ]    we remark here the different scaling of the energetic and dynamical instability with the interatomic interactions . decreasing the scattering length , the sound velocity decreases , and smaller and smaller group velocities can breakdown the superfluidity of the system ( in the limit @xmath156 , the sound velocity @xmath157 : the non interacting condensate is always energetically unstable for an arbitrary small group velocity ) . on the other hand , the dynamical modulational instability criteria does not depend on the scattering length .",
    "this apparent paradox is simply solved noticing that the growth time of the unstable modes , eq.([t_mi ] ) , actually depends on interactions , and diverge when the scattering length vanishes ( @xmath158 when @xmath159 ) .",
    "therefore , a noninteracting condensate is always dynamically stable .",
    "there is a further point to remark : if we consider a condensate moving with an increasing velocity , the system always becomes first energetically unstable , then it hits the dynamical instability . as a matter of fact , however , in real experiments the energetic instability can grow quite slowly ( and at zero temperature only in presence of impurities @xcite ) , so that the dominant dephasing mechanism is given by the modulational instability .",
    "this aspect can be highlighted also with numerical experiments , studying , for instance , bloch oscillations of a condensate with the interactions switched off . in this case , even though the system is energetically unstable , it remains coherent over many oscillations .",
    "if the interatomic interactions are switched on , however , the system dephase rather quickly , the dephasing occurring when the quasi - momentum of the condensate is in the dynamical unstable region of the bloch spectrum .",
    "we have done such numerical experiment , and results are shown in movies 4 and 5 .",
    "of course , our prediction can be tested in real experiments , tuning the scattering length with a feshbach resonance .",
    "to summarize , the tight binding approximation predicts the arising of the dynamical instability ( complex excitation frequency ) for @xmath160 .",
    "we point out that @xmath160 also corresponds to the quasi - momentum where , in the tight binding regime , the effective masses @xmath96 and @xmath99 change sign .",
    "a system with a negative effective mass and positive scattering length can be , roughly speaking , seen as equivalent to a system with a negative scattering length and positive effective mass .",
    "it is well known that a bec having a negative scattering length is dynamically unstable , and , therefore , such parallelism could be proposed to give a simple explanation of the instability . however , we will see that this coincidence between the arising of dynamical instabilities and the inversion of sign of the effective mass does not take place at lower optical potentials ( see fig .",

    "the third numerical simulation consists in creating a condensate in a harmonic trap superimposed to the optical lattice and , thereafter , switching off the harmonic trap in the lattice direction , letting the condensate expand in the periodic potential ( sect.[s_expansion ] ) : for values of the the mean - field energy large enough ( with a fixed height @xmath8 of the interwell energy barriers ) , the wave - packet is self - trapped @xcite and the spreading of the wave packet does not occur .    in all cases , for an interacting bec",
    ", we have found some sort of self - trapping and dynamical instabilities for some values of the depth of the periodic potential or the initial conditions of the bec wave packet .",
    "for instance , in the dipole oscillation experiment , the condensate may stop on one side of the harmonic potential being unable to complete the oscillation .",
    "it is useful to look at the dynamical evolution of the relative phases of condensates trapped in neighboring wells and the bec evolution in momentum space .",
    "there is a clear correspondence between the distribution in _ momentum _ space and that in _ quasi - momentum _ space : the quasi - momentum distribution of the bloch state @xmath65 with quasi - momentum @xmath69 is @xmath206 ; its momentum distribution is @xmath207 , where @xmath208 are integers and where the @xmath209 are the fourier coefficient of the periodic function @xmath210 .",
    "an analogous relation is also valid when the condensate is not in a well - defined bloch state , but in a superposition of bloch states of the first band . in this case",
    ", the width of the peaks of the momentum distribution will be equal to the width of the quasi - momentum distribution . in the following",
    "we will work with the momentum distribution , which is simply obtained from the fourier transform of the condensate wavefunction .",
    "bloch oscillations can be explained in very simple terms . in the presence of a linear potential superimposed to the optical lattice",
    ", the behaviour of a particle with quasi - momentum @xmath69 is described by the equation of motion @xmath211 , where @xmath212 is the constant force due to the linear potential .",
    "since the velocity is given by @xmath213 , when the effective mass is negative , the particle will respond to a positive ( negative ) force with a negative ( positive ) acceleration .",
    "since the energy band @xmath214 is periodic in @xmath69 , this will result in periodic oscillations in coordinate and velocity space .",
    "this simple explanation , even neglecting important effects like landau - zener tunneling to a higher band , provides a useful model to interpret experiments with electrons @xcite , with cold atoms @xcite and with bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "however , if interactions in the condensate play a mayor role , the scenario can change dramatically .",
    "first of all , the momentum distribution @xmath215 will not evolve just like @xmath216 , as it approximately happens for non interacting systems , but will also spread . furthermore , in the presence of interactions , it might happen that the condensate gets dephased and , after a short while , the oscillations stop ( see movie [ movie_bloch_1 ] ) .",
    "for the situation described in the movie ( @xmath217 , for which the tight binding approximation works well ) , the dephasing process begins when the center of the momentum distribution reaches @xmath160 .",
    "this point corresponds both to the on - set of the dynamical instabilities and the inversion of the effective mass .",
    "since the momentum distribution has a certain width , one could think that the oscillations stop because the sign of the effective mass is not the same for the whole condensate .",
    "an alternative interpretation relies on the onset of dynamical instabilities .     and @xmath173 .",

    "the initial spatial width is chosen in order to get about the same momentum distribution as in the interacting case , in order to have similar effective mass effects .",
    "more specifically , since in the interacting case the width of the momentum distribution increases slowly , while in the non interacting case it remains almost constant , we choose the initial conditions so that the two momentum distributions will be similar at the `` critical point '' , where @xmath219 .",
    "the direct comparison is shown in movie [ movie_bloch_2 ] .",
    "we observe , in the non - interacting case , regular , perfectly periodic bloch oscillations , in spite of the finite width of the momentum distribution .",
    "this clearly shows that , in the interacting case , the onset of decoherence is due to the dynamical instability .",
    "dipole oscillations consist in the motion of the condensate at the bottom of the harmonic trap .",
    "the average velocity is periodic in time and the momentum distribution , showing the characteristic peaks due to the optical lattice , also oscillates periodically in time at the bottom of the band . during the time evolution ,",
    "the phase differences between neighbouring condensates remain locked over the whole condensate .    for a given set of parameters corresponding to small displacements , small interactions or small optical potential depths ,",

    "in @xcite the occurrence of self - trapping has been predicted in the tight - binding : when interactions are larger than a critical value , the width of the wave packet does not continue to increase with time ( as for vanishing or small interactions ) and the wave packet remains localized around a few sites .",
