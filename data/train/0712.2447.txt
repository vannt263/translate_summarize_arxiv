    "most of the interesting physics signatures at the tevatron and lhc involve final states with jets of hadrons .",
    "a jet is reconstructed from energy depositions in calorimeter cells and/or from charged particle track momenta , and ideally is corrected for detector response and resolution effects so that the resultant 4-vector corresponds to that of the sum of the original hadrons comprising the jet .",
    "the jets can also be further corrected , for hadronization effects , back to the parton(s ) from which the jet originated .",
    "the resultant measurements can be compared to predictions from parton shower monte carlos .",
    "if further corrections are made to account for the showers , or if these corrections are assumed to be small , comparisons can be made directly to the short distance partons described by fixed order perturbative calculations .    in order to actually reconstruct a jet , and make comparisons between data and theoretical predictions , a precise definition of the jet is required .",
    "the definition is presented in the form of a jet algorithm .",
    "jet algorithms cluster partons , or particles or calorimeter towers based on proximity in coordinate space ( as for example in cone algorithms ) or proximity in momentum space ( as for example in @xmath0 algorithms ) . for a precise comparison of experiment to theory , it is advantageous for a jet algorithm to provide a similar description of a hard scatter event regardless if it is applied at the detector , hadron or parton level .    in this article",
    ", we will review some of the complexities of jet algorithms and of the resultant comparisons of data to theory . we will review the extensive experience with jet measurements at the tevatron , the extrapolation of this acquired wisdom to the lhc and the differences between the tevatron and lhc environments .",
    "we will also discuss ways in which the jet algorithm systematics can be reduced to the percent level , an important goal for lhc analyses . finally we will describe a framework ( spartyjet ) for the convenient comparison of results using different jetalgorithms .",
    "several of the authors are members of cdf and atlas and we apologize in advance for our concentration on those experiments . given the restrictions of space , we will not try a comprehensive review of physics with jets at hadron - hadron colliders , but instead refer the reader to a recent review  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental challenge when trying to make theoretical predictions or interpret experimentally observed final states is that the theory of the strong interactions ( qcd ) is most easily applied to the short distance ( @xmath1 1 fermi ) degrees of freedom , _",
    "i.e_. , to the color - charged quarks and gluons , while the long distance degrees of freedom seen in the detectors are color singlet bound states of these degrees of freedom .",
    "we picture the overall scattering process , as pictorially displayed in fig .",
    "[ scatter ]  @xcite , evolving from the incoming long distance hadrons in the beams to the short - distance scattering process to the long distance outgoing states , as occurring in several ( approximately ) distinct steps .",
    "the separation , or factorization , of these steps is essential both conceptually and calculationally .",
    "it is based on the distinct distance ( or momentum ) scales inherent at each step .",
    "we imagine as a first step picking out from the incident beam particles the short distance partons ( defined by an appropriate factorization scale ) that participate in the short distance scattering .",
    "the relative probability to find the scattering partons at this step is provided by the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , which are functions of the partons color and flavor , the longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath2 carried by the partons and the factorization scale @xmath3 , all of which serve to uniquely define the desired partons .",
    "the pdfs are themselves determined from global fits  @xcite to a wide variety of data , all of which can be analyzed in the context of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) essentially as outlined here .",
    "the partons selected in this way can emit radiation prior to the short distance scattering yielding the possibility of initial state radiation ( isr ) .  the remnants of the original hadrons , with one parton removed , are no longer color singlet states and will interact , presumably softly , with each other generating ( approximately incoherently from the hard scattering ) an underlying distribution of soft partons , the beginning of the underlying event ( ue ) .    next comes the short distance , large momentum transfer scattering process that may change the character of the scattering partons and/or produce more partons ( or other interesting particles ) .",
    "the cross section for this step is evaluated at fixed order in pqcd , presumably to next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) , or higher .  then comes another color radiation step , when many new gluons and quark pairs are added to the state ( final state radiation or fsr ) , dominated by partons that have low energy and/or are nearly collinear with the scattered short distance partons .",
    "the fsr , like the isr , is described by the showers in the monte carlo programs  @xcite and calculated probabilistically in terms of summed leading logarithm perturbation theory .",
    "the final step in the evolution to long distance states involves a non - perturbative hadronization process that organizes the colored degrees of freedom from the showering and from the softer interactions of other initial state partons ( the ue is simulated in terms of beam - beam remnants and multiple parton interactions ) into color - singlet hadrons with physical masses .",
    "the non - perturbative hadronization process yields a collection of ground state hadrons ( primarily pions ) and resonances ( @xmath4,etc ) , and the resonances then decay into lighter hadrons such as pions .",
    "the masses of the resonances result in the decay pions being produced with non - zero transverse momenta with respect to the momentum direction of the original resonance ( but still small compared to typical jet momenta ) .",
    "the details are determined from data but the decay modes for some of the higher mass resonances are not well - understood leading to uncertainties ( and differences between monte carlo programs ) in the details of the production of the final state hadrons . a convenient dictionary of the terms described above",
    "is summarized in fig .",
    "[ dictionary ]  @xcite .",
    "the hadronization step is accomplished in a model dependent fashion ( _ i.e_. , a different fashion ) in different monte carlos .",
    "the union of the showering and the hadronization steps is what has historically been labelled as fragmentation , as in fragmentation functions describing the longitudinal distribution of hadrons within final state jets .  in practice ,",
    "both the radiation and hadronization steps tend to smear out the energy that was originally localized in the individual short distance partons ( a splash - out  effect ) , while the contributions from the underlying event ( and any pile - up  from multiple hadron collisions in the same data - taking time interval ) add to the energy originally present in the short distance scattering ( a splash - in  effect ) .",
    "finally the hadrons , and their decay products , are detected with finite precision in a detector .",
    "this final step of the jet components interacting in the detector is represented in fig .",
    "[ jet_stages ] .",
    "the separation of this complicated scattering process into distinct steps is not strictly valid in quantum mechanics where interference plays a role ; we must sum the amplitudes before squaring them and not just sum the squares .",
    "however , some features of this factorization can be rigorously established  @xcite , and the numerical dominance of collinear qcd radiation ensures that the simple picture presented here and quantified by monte carlo generated events , with interference only approximately represented in the structure of the showers , _",
    "e.g_. , the angles of emission of partons in the showers are monotonically ordered , provides a reliable first approximation . in order to interpret the experimentally detected long distance objects , the charged particles and energy depositions in calorimeter cells , in terms of the underlying short distance physics , the partons ,",
    "jet algorithms are employed to associate nearby  experimental objects into jets .",
    "the underlying assumption is that the kinematics ( energy and momentum ) of the resulting cluster or jet provides a useful measure of the kinematics ( energy and momentum ) of the underlying , short - distance partons .",
    "the goal is to characterize the short - distance physics , event - by - event , in terms of the discrete jets found by the algorithm .  in particular , we assume that the basic mismatch between colored short - distance theory objects and the colorless long - distance experimental objects does not present an important numerical limitation , compared to our goal of percent level accuracy for jet algorithm effects .",
    "we assume that we are either insensitive to or can reliably correct for the effects of the ue , isr , fsr and hadronization .",
    "we assume that most relevant features of a jet can be described by the ( up to ) 2 partons per jet present in a nlo calculation .",
    "we will investigate the features that are not so well - described .",
    "as noted , jet algorithms rely on the merging of objects that are , by some measure , nearby each other .",
    "this feature is essential in perturbation theory , where the divergent contributions from virtual  diagrams must contribute in exactly the same way , _",
    "i.e_. , contribute to the same kinematic bins , as the divergent contributions from soft and collinear real emissions , in order that these contributions can cancel .",
    "it is only through this cancellation that jet algorithms serve to define an ir - safe ( finite ) quantity , _",
    "i.e. _ , a quantity that is insensitive to the emission of extra soft and/or collinear partons . the standard measures of nearness  ( see  @xcite ) include pair - wise relative transverse momenta , as in the @xmath0 algorithm , or angles relative to a jet axis , as in the cone algorithm .  by definition a good  algorithm yields stable ( _ i.e_. , very similar ) results whether it is applied to a state with just a few partons ( as in nlo  perturbation theory ) , a state with many partons ( after the parton shower as simulated in a monte carlo ) , a state with hadrons ( as simulated in a monte carlo including a model for the hadronization step and the underlying event ) , or applied to the observed tracks and energy deposition in a real detector .",
    "as we will see , this requirement constitutes a substantial challenge .",
    "further , it is highly desirable that the identification of jets be insensitive to the contributions from the simultaneous uncorrelated soft collisions that occur during pile - up at high luminosity .",
    "finally , we want to be able to apply the _ same _ algorithm ( in detail ) at each level in the evolution of the hadronic final state .",
    "this implies that we must avoid components in the algorithm that make sense when applied to data but not to fixed order perturbation theory , or vice versa .",
    "this constraint will play an important role in our subsequent discussion .    in practice , we can think of the jet algorithm as a set of mathematical rules that detail how to carry out two distinct steps .",
    "the first step operates , event - by - event , on the list of 4-vectors , which describes either the perturbative final state , the final - state hadrons in the mc simulated event or the output from the detector , to turn the original list into a set of sublists , one sublist for each jet ( plus the beam jets ) .",
    "the second step specified by the algorithm tells us how to construct appropriate kinematic quantities from each sublist in order to describe the kinematic properties of the individual jets .",
    "both steps depend on the specific jet algorithm , as will be illustrated in detail in the next sections for specific jet algorithms , and have varied over time .",
    "in particular , early applications of jets did not employ true 4-vector arithmetic and largely ignored the information carried by the invariant mass of the jet .  in run ii at the tevatron and at the lhc true 4-vector arithmetic is and will be employed ( the so - called e - scheme  as recommended for run ii in  @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding kinematic variables describing the jets include the ( true ) transverse momentum , @xmath5 , the rapidity , @xmath6 , the azimuthal angle , @xmath7 , and the invariant mass of the jet , @xmath8 .  we will have more to say about the history of different choices of kinematic variables in the next section .    for many events ,",
    "the jet structure is clear and the jets , into which the individual calorimeter towers should be assigned , are fairly unambiguous .",
    "however , in other events , such as the lego plot of a cdf event shown in fig .",
    "[ lego3 ] , the complexity of the energy depositions means that different algorithms will result in different assignments of towers to the various jets .",
    "this is not a problem if a similar complexity is exhibited by the theoretical calculation which is to be compared to the data .",
    "however , the most precise and thoroughly understood theoretical calculations arise in fixed order perturbation theory , which can exhibit only limited complexity , _ e.g_. , at most 2 partons per jet at nlo .  on the other hand , for events simulated with parton shower monte",
    "carlos the complexity of the final state is more realistic , but the intrinsic theoretical uncertainty is larger .",
    "correspondingly the jets identified by the algorithms vary if we compare at the perturbative , shower , hadron and detector levels .",
    "thus it is essential to understand these limitations of jet algorithms and , as much as possible , eliminate or correct for them to approach our percent level goal .",
    "it is the aim of the following review to highlight the issues that arose during runs i and ii at the tevatron , discuss their current understanding , and outline possible preventative measures for the lhc  @xcite .",
    "to illustrate the behavior of jet algorithms consider first the original snowmass implementation of the iterative cone algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the first step in the algorithm , _",
    "i.e_. , the identification of the sublists of objects corresponding to the jets , is defined in terms of a simple sum over all ( short distance or long distance ) objects within a cone centered at rapidity ( the original version used the pseudorapidity @xmath9 ) and azimuthal angle @xmath10 . using the objects in the cone we can define a @xmath5-weighted centroid via@xmath11 if the @xmath5-weighted centroid does not coincide with the geometric center of the cone , @xmath12 , a cone is placed at the @xmath5-weighted centroid and the calculation is repeated .",
    "this simple calculation is _ iterated _ until a stable  cone is found , @xmath13 , which serves to define the jet ( and the name of this algorithm as the iterative cone algorithm ) .",
    "thus , at least in principle , one can think in terms of placing trial cones everywhere in @xmath14 and allowing them to flow  until a stable cone or jet is found .",
    "this flow idea is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ towerflow ] , where a ) illustrates the lego plot for a simple ( quiet ) monte carlo generated event with 3 apparent jets and b ) shows the corresponding flows of the trial cones towards the ( obvious ) final jets .",
    "compared to the event in fig .",
    "[ lego3 ] there is little ambiguity in this event concerning the jet structure .    to facilitate the subsequent discussion and provide some mathematical structure for this image of flow",
    "we can define the snowmass potential  in terms of the 2-dimensional vector @xmath15 via@xmath16 where the @xmath17 function defines the objects inside the cone centered at @xmath18 .",
    "the flow described by the iteration process is driven by the force@xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is defined by @xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "as desired , this force  pushes the cone to the stable cone position , _",
    "i.e_. , the minimum of the snowmass potential .",
    "as noted above the current run ii analyses and those expected at the lhc , described in more detail below , 4-vector techniques are used and the corresponding e - scheme centroid is given instead by @xmath24 in the nlo perturbative calculation these changes in definitions result in only tiny numerical changes , compared to the snowmass definition numbers .",
    "as an introduction to how the iterative cone algorithm works , consider first its application to nlo level in perturbation theory ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) , where there are at most 2 partons in a cone .",
    "as defined above , the cone algorithm specifies that two partons are included in the same jet ( _ i.e_. , form a stable cone ) if they are both within @xmath25 ( _ e.g_. , 0.7 in @xmath14 space ) of the centroid , which they themselves define .",
    "this means that 2 partons of equal @xmath5 can form a single jet as long as their pair - wise angular separation does not exceed the boundaries of the cone , @xmath26 .  on the other hand ,",
    "as long as @xmath27 , there will also be stable cones centered around each of the partons .  the corresponding 2-parton phase space for @xmath28 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pertthy ] a ) in terms of the ratio @xmath29 and the angular separation variable @xmath30 .  to the left of the line",
    "@xmath31 the two partons always form a single stable cone and jet , while to the far right , @xmath32 , there are always two distinct stable cones and jets , with a single parton in each jet .",
    "more interesting is the central region , @xmath33 , which exhibits both the case of two stable cones ( one of the partons in each cone ) and the case of three stable cones ( the previous two cones plus a third cone that includes both partons ) .",
    "the precise outcome depends on the specific values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "( note that the exactly straight diagonal boundary in the figure corresponds to the @xmath5-weighted definition of the snowmass algorithm , but is only slightly distorted , @xmath36 , when full 4-vector kinematics is used in the run ii algorithms . )   to see the three stable cone structure in terms of the 2-parton `` snowmass potential '' consider the point @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which is in the 3 cones @xmath39 1 jet region .",
    "this configuration , in terms of the 2-parton coordinates @xmath34 and @xmath35 , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ edist]a .",
    "the corresponding energy in a cone , @xmath40 , normalized to the energy of the more energetic parton , is illustrated by the ( red ) dashed line in fig .",
    "[ edist]b , where the location of the cone center , @xmath18 , is constrained to lie in the plane of the 2 partons with the origin at the location of the more energetic parton . the solid ( green ) curve in fig .",
    "[ edist]b shows the corresponding `` snowmass potential '' , again normalized to the energy of the more energetic parton , versus the same 1-d location radius @xmath18 .",
    "this potential exhibits the expected 3 minima corresponding to a stable cone at each parton ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) and a third stable cone , central between the other two , that includes the contributions from both partons .",
    "a relevant point is that the central minimum is not nearly as deep ( _ i.e. _ , as robust ) as the other two .",
    "as we shall see , this minimum often does not survive the smearing inherent in the transition from the short distances of fixed order perturbation theory to the long distances of the physical final state .  as indicated by the labeling in fig .",
    "[ pertthy ] , in the 3 stable cone region the original perturbative calculation  @xcite kept as the jet the 2-in-1 stable cone , maximum @xmath5 configuration , _",
    "i.e_. , the cone that included all of the energy in the other two cones consistent with the merging discussion below .",
    "as we will see , much of the concern and confusion about the cone algorithm arises from the treatment of this 3 stable cone region .",
    "it is intuitively obvious that , as the energy in the short - distance partons is smeared out by subsequent showering and hadronization , the detailed structure in this region is likely to change .  in particular , while two nearly equal @xmath5 partons separated by nearly @xmath43 may define a stable cone in fixed order pqcd , this configuration is unlikely to yield a stable cone after showering and hadronization .",
    "having performed the first step in the algorithm to identify the particles in the cone @xmath44 , the second step is to define the kinematic variables describing the jet .",
    "as suggested above the the snowmass definition of the iterative cone algorithm used angular variables defined by the @xmath5 weighted expressions @xmath45 and , instead of the true transverse momentum , the scalar transverse momentum@xmath46 in the ( recommended ) case of 4-vector arithmetic we have instead ( as suggested as above)@xmath47 during run i cdf used an intermediate set of definitions with e - scheme ( 4-vector ) angles and the jet transverse momentum  given by the transverse energy@xmath48 in the next section we will briefly explore the quantitative differences between  these definitions in the context of nlo perturbation theory .",
    "iterative cone algorithms similar to the ones described in the previous section were employed by both the cdf and d  collaborations during run i with considerable success .",
    "there was fairly good agreement with nlo pqcd for the inclusive jet cross section over a dynamic range of order @xmath50 .  during run",
    "i , the data were corrected primarily for detector effects and for the contributions of the underlying event .",
    "in fact , a positive feature of the cone algorithm is that , since the cone s geometry in @xmath51 space is ( meant to be ) simple , the correction for the splash - in  contribution of the ( largely uncorrelated ) underlying event ( and pile - up ) is straightforward .",
    "( as we will see below , the corrections being used in run ii are more sophisticated . )  the uncertainties in both the data and the theory were @xmath52 or greater , depending on the kinematic regime , and helped to ensure agreement .  however , as cone jets were studied in more detail , various troubling issues arose .  for example , it was noted long ago  @xcite that , when using the experimental cone algorithms implemented at the tevatron , two jets of comparable energy ( taken from 2 different events in the data ) are not merged into a single jet if they are separated by an angular distance greater than approximately 1.3 times the cone radius , while the simple picture of fig .",
    "[ pertthy ] a ) suggests that merging should occur out to an angular separation of @xmath43 .",
    "independently it was also noted that the dependence of the experimental inclusive jet cross section on the cone radius @xmath25  @xcite and the shape of the energy distribution within a jet  @xcite both differed discernibly from the nlo predictions ( the data were less @xmath25 dependent and exhibited less energy near the edge of the cone ) .",
    "all three of these issues seemed to be associated with the contribution from the perturbative configuration of two partons with comparable @xmath5 at opposite sides of the cone ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 in fig .",
    "[ pertthy ] a ) ) and the data suggested a lower contribution from this configuration than present in the perturbative result .  to simulate this feature in the perturbative analysis , a phenomenological parameter @xmath49 was added to the nlo implementation of the cone algorithm  @xcite .  in this `` experiment - aware '' version of the perturbative cone algorithm ,",
    "two partons are not merged into a single jet if they are separated by more than @xmath55 from each other , independent of their individual distance from the @xmath5-weighted jet centroid .",
    "thus , the two partons are merged into the same jet if they are within @xmath25 of the @xmath5-weighted jet centroid and within @xmath56 of each other ; otherwise the two partons are identified as separate jets . in order to describe the observed @xmath25 dependence of the cross section and the observed energy profile of jets , the specific value @xmath57 was chosen ( along with a smallish  renormalization / factorization scale @xmath58 ) , which was subsequently noted to be in good agreement with the aforementioned ( independent ) jet separation study .  the resulting 2 parton phase space is indicated in fig .",
    "[ pertthy ] b ) .  in the perturbative calculation , this redefinition , leading to a slightly lower average @xmath5 for the leading jet , lowers the nlo jet cross section by about 5% ( for @xmath59 and @xmath60 gev@xmath61 ) .",
    "it is important to recognize that the fractional contribution to the inclusive jet cross section of the merged 2 parton configurations in the entire wedge to the right of @xmath31 is only of order @xmath52 for jet @xmath5 of order 100 gev@xmath61 , and , being proportional to @xmath62 , decreases with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "thus it is no surprise that , although this region was apparently treated differently ( in the nlo theory comparisons ) by the cone algorithm implementations of cdf and d  during run i as discussed below , there were no relevant cross section disagreements above the @xmath63 uncertainties .  further , as we will discuss below , it is the variation in the treatment of this ( effectively 10% ) region of the 2-parton phase space that drives many of the differences between jet algorithms .    while the parameter @xmath49 is _ ad hoc _ and thus an undesirable complication in the perturbative jet analysis , it will serve as a useful pedagogical tool in the following discussions .",
    "to illustrate this point quantitatively , fig .",
    "[ fig : allet ] shows the dependence on @xmath49 for various choices of the jet momentum @xmath64 at nlo in perturbation theory .",
    "the curves labeled snowmass use the @xmath5 weighted kinematics described above with @xmath64 given by the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the partons in the cone . the two e - scheme algorithms use full 4-vector kinematics and @xmath64 equal to either the magnitude of the true ( vector sum ) transverse momentum ( the recommended choice ) , or the transverse energy  defined by @xmath65 ( as defined by cdf in run i ) .",
    "thus this last variable knows about both the momentum and the invariant mass of the set of partons in the cone , which can be sizable for well separated parton pairs .",
    "the differences in the various ratios for different values of @xmath49 tell us about how the 2-parton configurations contribute .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : allet ] a ) tells us that , since , for a given configuration of 2 partons in a cone , @xmath66 , the cross sections at a given value of @xmath64 will show the same ordering .",
    "further , as expected , the differences are reduced if we keep only configurations with small angular separation , @xmath67 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : allet ] b ) we confirm the earlier statement that lowering @xmath49 from 2 to 1.3 yields a @xmath68 change for the snowmass algorithm cross section with @xmath69 gev , while lowering it all the way to @xmath67 , _",
    "i.e. _ , removing all of the triangular region , lowers the 100 gev snowmass jet cross section by approximately @xmath70 .",
    "[ fig : allet ] c ) and d ) confirm that 4-vector kinematics with @xmath71 exhibits the smallest sensitivity to @xmath49 , _",
    "i.e. _ , to the 2-parton configurations in the triangle .",
    "the choice @xmath72 , with its dependence on the mass of the pair , exhibits the largest sensitivity to @xmath49 .",
    "these are all good reasons to use the recommended e - scheme kinematics with @xmath71 .",
    "the move to employ 4-vector kinematics for jet analyses in run ii and at the lhc is a positive step",
    ".  it will allow the meaningful investigation of jet masses , which will likely be very useful at the lhc .",
    "the decay of large mass ( few tev ) new particles will lead to highly boosted @xmath73s , @xmath74s and top quarks that will be observed as single jets .",
    "thus the mass of such jets may constitute a useful selection tool .",
    "the difference between the perturbative implementation of the iterative cone algorithm and the experimental implementation at the tevatron , which is simulated by @xmath49 , is thought to arise from several sources .",
    "while the perturbative version ( with @xmath75 ) analytically includes _ all _ 2-parton configurations that satisfy the algorithm ( recall fig .  [ pertthy ] a ) ) , the experiments employ the concept of _ seeds _ to reduce the analysis time and place trial  cones only in regions of the detector where there are seeds , _",
    "i.e_. , pre - clusters with substantial energy .",
    "this procedure introduces another parameter , the lower @xmath5 threshold defining the seeds , and also decreases the likelihood of finding the 2-showers - in - one - jet configurations corresponding to the upper right - hand corner of the 3 cones @xmath39 1 jet region of fig .",
    "[ pertthy ] a ) and the middle minimum in fig .",
    "[ edist ] b ) .",
    "thus , the use of seeds contributes to the need for @xmath76 .",
    "perhaps more importantly , the desire to match the theoretical algorithm with the experimental one means that we should include seeds in the perturbative algorithm .",
    "this is accomplished by placing trial cones only at the locations of each parton and testing to see if any other partons are inside of these cones .",
    "thus at nlo , 2 partons will be merged into a single jet only if they are closer than @xmath25 in @xmath14 space .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath77 in the language of fig .",
    "[ pertthy ] and produces a larger numerical change in the analysis than observed , _",
    "i.e. _ , we wanted @xmath78 .",
    "more importantly at the next order in perturbation theory , nnlo , there are extra partons that can play the role of low energy seeds .",
    "the corresponding parton configurations are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ 2inone ] .  at nlo , or in the virtual correction in nnlo , the absence of any extra partons to serve as a seed leads to two distinct cones as on the left , while a ( soft ) real emission at nnlo can lead to the configuration on the right where the soft gluon seeds  the middle cone that includes all of the partons .  the resulting separation between the nnlo virtual contribution and the nnlo soft real emission contribution ( _ i.e_. , they contribute to different jet configurations ) leads to an undesirable logarithmic dependence on the seed @xmath5 threshold  @xcite .  in the limit of an arbitrarily soft seed",
    "@xmath5 cutoff , the cone algorithm with seeds is no longer ir - safe .  by introducing seeds in the algorithm ,",
    "we have introduced exactly what we want to avoid , sensitivity to soft emissions .  from the theory perspective , seeds are an undesirable component in the algorithm and should be eliminated .",
    "the labeling of the run i cone algorithm with seeds as infrared unsafe has led some theorists to suggest that the corresponding analyses should be disregarded .",
    "this is too extreme a reaction , especially since the numerical difference between the jet cross section found in data using seeds is expected to be less than a few percent different from an analysis using a seedless algorithm",
    ".  a more useful approach will be to either avoid the use of seeds , or to correct for them in the analysis of the data , which can then be compared to a perturbative analysis without seeds .",
    "note that it may seem surprising that an algorithm , which is infrared unsafe due to the use of seeds , leads to experimental results that differ from a infrared safe seedless algorithm by only a few percent .",
    "the essential point is that the lack of ir - safety is a property of the fixed - order perturbative application of the algorithm with seeds , not of the experimental application . in real data",
    "the additional soft components of the event ( initial state radiation , final state radiation and the underlying event ) ensure that there are seeds nearly  everywhere .",
    "thus there is only a small change from the situation where seeds are assumed to be everywhere ( the seedless algorithm ) . in stark contrast",
    "the nlo perturbative application of an algorithm with seeds has only the energetic partons themselves to act as seeds .",
    "thus there is a dramatic change at nnlo where the extra parton can serve as a seed , as in fig .",
    "[ 2inone ] , changing the found jet structure of the event even when the extra parton is quite low energy .",
    "this is the source of the perturbative infrared sensitivity .",
    "one of the main problems with the use of a seedless cone algorithm has been its slow speed with respect to the seeded cone algorithms .",
    "this has made its use in reconstruction of a large number of events difficult .",
    "combined with the fact that , for inclusive distributions , the differences between the results from a seeded cone algorithm like midpoint ( defined below ) and a seedless algorithm tend to be on the order of a percent or less , there was no strong motivation for its use .",
    "recently , a new seedless algorithm ( siscone )  @xcite that has speeds comparable to the seeded cone algorithms has been developed , removing this difficulty . for this reason , the siscone algorithm is being adopted by the experiments at both the tevatron and lhc ( faster ) version of the seedless algorithm was used during the early stages of cdf in run ii , but was dropped because of the near equivalence of the results obtained with the midpoint cone algorithm . ] . note that the problems with dark towers and the smearing of stable solution points ( discussed later in section  [ sec : smearing_dark_towers ] ) still remain with a seedless algorithm .    to address the issue of seeds on the experimental side and",
    "the @xmath49 parameter on the phenomenological side , the run ii study  @xcite recommended using the midpoint cone algorithm , in which , having identified 2 nearby jets , one always checks for a stable cone with its center at the midpoint between the 2 found cones .",
    "thus , in the imagery of fig . [ 2inone ] , the central stable cone is now always looked for , whether there is an actual seed there or not .",
    "it was hoped that this would remove the sensitivity to the use of seeds and remove the need for the @xmath49 parameter .  while this expectation is fully justified with the localized , short distance configuration indicated in fig .",
    "[ 2inone ] , more recent studies suggest that at least part of the difficulty with the missing stable cones at the midpoint position is due to the ( real ) smearing effects on the energy distribution in @xmath14 of showering and hadronization .  also it is important to note that , in principle , ir - safety issues due to seeds will reappear in perturbation theory at order nnnlo , where the midpoint is not the only problem configuration ( for example , a seed at the center of a triangular array of 3 hard and merge - able partons can lead to ir - sensitivity ) .  eliminating the use of seeds remains the most attractive option .      before proceeding we must consider another important issue that arises when comparing the cone algorithm applied in perturbation theory with its application to data at the tevatron",
    "the practical definition of jets equaling stable cones does not eliminate the possibility that the stable cones can overlap , _",
    "i.e_. , share a subset ( or even all ) of their calorimeter towers .  to address this ambiguity , experimental decisions had to be made as to when to completely merge the two cones ( based on the level of overlap ) , or , if not merging , how to split the shared energy .",
    "note that there is only a weak analogy to this overlap issue in the nlo calculation . as described in fig .",
    "[ pertthy ] a ) , there is no overlap in either the left - hand ( 1 cone @xmath39 1 jet ) or right - hand ( 2 cones @xmath39 2 jets ) regions , while in the middle ( 3 cones @xmath39 1 jet ) region the overlap between the 3 cones is 100% and the cones are always merged .",
    "arguably the phenomenological parameter @xmath49 also serves to approximately simulate not only seeds but also the role of non - complete merging in the experimental analysis .  in practice in run",
    "i , cdf and d  chose to use slightly different merging parameters .",
    "thus , largely unknown to most of the theory community , the two experiments used somewhat different cone jet algorithms in run i.  the cdf collaboration cone algorithm , jetclu  @xcite , also employed another feature  called ratcheting , that was likewise under - documented .",
    "ratcheting ensured that any calorimeter tower in an initial seed was always retained in the corresponding final jet .",
    "stability of the final cones was partially driven by this no - tower - left - behind  feature .  presumably the two experiments reported compatible jet physics results in run i due to the  substantial @xmath79 uncertainties .",
    "note also that , after the splitting / merging step , the resulting cone jets will not always have a simple , symmetric shape in @xmath14 , which complicates the task of correcting for the underlying event and leads to larger uncertainties .  in any case",
    "the plan for run ii as outlined in the run ii  studies  @xcite , called for cone jet algorithms in the 2 collaborations as similar as possible .",
    "unfortunately , during run ii the collaborations have evolved to employing somewhat different cone algorithms .  on the merging question ,",
    "cdf in run ii merges two overlapping cones when more than 75% of the smaller cone s energy overlaps with the larger jet .",
    "when the overlap is less , the overlap towers are assigned to the nearest jet .",
    "d , on the other hand , uses a criterion of a 50% overlap in order to merge .",
    "there is anecdotal evidence from several studies that a merging criterion of 75% may be safer  in high - density final states  @xcite , where there is a tendency for over - merging to occur .",
    "while it is not necessary that all analyses use the same jet algorithm , for purposes of comparison it would be very useful for the experiments to have one truly common algorithm .",
    "there is certainly a lesson to be learned here for the collaborations at the lhc .      in summary , the iterative cone algorithm benefits , in principle , from a simple geometric definition that allows simple corrections for the ue contributions .",
    "at the same time it suffers from the experimental use of seeds and the need to implement a split / merge stage . the inclusion of the @xmath49 parameter in the perturbative calculation , while allowing more detailed comparisons to data , has also served to confuse the situation . before discussing the role of fragmentation and smearing in the cone algorithm , we turn now to the other primary jet algorithm , the @xmath0 algorithm .      with the mixed history of success for the cone algorithm , the ( as yet )",
    "less well studied @xmath0 algorithm  @xcite offers the possibility of more nearly identical analyses in both experiments and in perturbation theory .",
    "this algorithm , which was first used at electron - positron colliders , is based on a pair - wise recombination scheme intended , in some sense , to undo  the splitting that occurs during the fragmentation stage .",
    "two partons / particles / calorimeter towers are combined if their relative transverse momentum is less than a given measure .  to illustrate the clustering process ,",
    "consider a multi - parton final state .  initially each parton is considered as a proto - jet .",
    "the quantities@xmath81 are computed for each proto - jet @xmath82 and each pair of proto - jets @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "as earlier , @xmath84 is the transverse momentum of the @xmath85 proto - jet and @xmath86 is the distance ( in @xmath87 space , @xmath88 ) between each pair of proto - jets .",
    "@xmath89 is the parameter that controls the size of the jet ( analogous to @xmath25 ) .",
    "if the smallest of the above quantities is a @xmath90 , then that proto - jet becomes a jet and is removed from the proto - jet list .",
    "if the smallest quantity is a @xmath91 , then the two proto - jets @xmath92 are merged into a single proto - jet by summing their four - vector components , and the two original entries in the proto - jet list are replaced by this single merged entry .",
    "this process is iterated with the corrected proto - jet list until all the proto - jets have become jets , _",
    "i.e_. , at the last step the @xmath91 for all pairs of proto - jets are larger than all @xmath90 for the proto - jets individually ( _ i.e_. , the remaining proto - jets are well separated ) and the latter all become jets .     note that in the pqcd nlo inclusive @xmath0 jet calculation , the parton pair with the smallest @xmath93 may or may not be combined into a single jet , depending on the @xmath90 of the individual partons .",
    "thus the final state can consist of either 2 or 3 jets , as was also the case for the cone algorithm .",
    "in fact , the pqcd nlo result for the inclusive @xmath0 jet cross section  @xcite suggests near equality with the cone jet cross section in the case that @xmath94 ( with no seeds , @xmath75 ) .",
    "thus the inclusive cone jet cross section with @xmath28 ( @xmath75 ) is comparable in magnitude to the inclusive @xmath0 jet cross section with @xmath95 , at least at nlo .  in the nlo language illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pertthy ] the condition that the partons be merged in the @xmath0 algorithm is that @xmath96 or @xmath97 .",
    "thus , at nlo , the @xmath0 algorithm corresponds to the cone algorithm with @xmath98 , @xmath67 .",
    "the earlier result , @xmath94 ( with @xmath75 ) , is just the nlo statement that the contribution of the rectangular region @xmath99 , @xmath100 is numerically approximately equal to the contribution of the rectangular region @xmath101 , @xmath100 plus the ( 3 stable cone ) triangular region @xmath102 , @xmath100 .",
    "in contrast to the cone case , the @xmath0 algorithm has no problems with overlapping jets and , less positively , every calorimeter tower is assigned to some jet .  while this last result made some sense in the @xmath103 collider case , where every final state particle arose from the short - distance process",
    ", it is less obviously desirable in the hadron collider case .",
    "while the @xmath0 algorithm tends to automatically correct for the splash - out effect by re - merging the energy distribution smeared by showering and hadronization into a single jet , this same feature leads to a tendency to enhance the splash - in effect by `` vacuuming up '' the contributions from the underlying event and including them in the large @xmath90 jets .",
    "this issue is exacerbated when the luminosity reaches the point that there is more than one collision per beam bunch crossing and pile - up is significant .",
    "this is now true at the tevatron and will certainly be true eventually at the lhc .",
    "thus while the ( splash - out ) fragmentation corrections for the @xmath0 algorithm are expected to be smaller than for cone algorithms , the ( splash - in ) underlying event corrections will be larger .  a test of our understanding of these corrections will be provided by the comparison of the @xmath89 and @xmath25 parameter values that yield comparable experimental jet cross sections .",
    "if we can reliably correct back to the fixed order perturbative level for both the cone and @xmath0 algorithms , we should see @xmath94 .",
    "note that this result assumes that the cone jet cross section has been corrected to the value corresponding to @xmath75 .",
    "on the other hand , under - corrected splash - in contributions in the @xmath0 algorithm will require @xmath104 for comparable jet cross section values ( still assuming that @xmath75 describes the cone results ) . if the cone algorithm jet cross section has under - corrected splash - out effects ( @xmath76 ) , we expect that an even smaller ratio of @xmath89 to @xmath25 will be required to obtain comparable jet cross sections ( crudely we expect @xmath105 for @xmath106 ) .",
    "as we will discuss below , the current studies at the tevatron suggest that @xmath107 for comparable cross sections implying that indeed the @xmath0 algorithm is efficiently vacuuming up extra particles",
    ". however , once corrected back to the parton level , the @xmath108 algorithm cross section is smaller than the cone result for @xmath109 as expected .",
    "another concern with the @xmath0 algorithm is the computer time needed to perform multiple evaluations of the list of pairs of proto - jets as 1 pair is merged with each pass , leading to a time that grows as @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the number of initial proto - jets in the event .",
    "recently  @xcite a faster version of the @xmath0 algorithm , fastjet , has been defined that recalculates only an intelligently chosen sub - list with each pass and the time grows only as @xmath112 , for large @xmath111 .",
    "the software in @xcite also provides alternative versions of the @xmath0 algorithm .",
    "as defined above , the algorithm is the _ inclusive _ version , keeping all possible jets defined by the parameter @xmath89 .",
    "there is also an _ exclusive _ version @xcite where another parameter @xmath113 is introduced .",
    "merging stops when all remaining @xmath114 and @xmath90 exceed @xmath113 and the remaining @xmath90 define the exclusively defined jets ( _ i.e_. , the previously removed @xmath115 jets are discarded ) .",
    "the fastjet code also includes the so - called cambridge / aachen @xmath0 algorithm @xcite@xcite , the inclusive version of which is defined similarly to the algorithm above except that the prefactor @xmath116 is absent from @xmath91 and @xmath117 .",
    "finally the fastjet code for the @xmath0 algorithm also includes an innovative technique for defining the area  of the jet and allowing a correcting for the ue contribution .",
    "fake or ghost  particles with exponentially tiny energies are added to each event on an essentially uniform grid in @xmath14 ( _ i.e. _ , each ghost particle is representative of a fixed area in @xmath14 ) .",
    "the final jets found by the algorithm will then contain some of the ghost particles .  while the kinematics of the jet is unchanged by the presence of the ghost particles ( since they have such tiny energies ) , their number gives a measure of the area in @xmath14 of the jet .",
    "it should also be noted that , although it would appear that the inclusive @xmath0 algorithm is defined by a single parameter @xmath89 , the suggested code for the @xmath0 algorithm @xcite includes several switches and parameters to fully define the specific implementation of the algorithm .",
    "thus , as is the case for the cone algorithm , the @xmath0 algorithm also exhibits opportunities for divergence between the implementation of the algorithm in the various experiments , and care should be taken to avoid this outcome .",
    "as has already been suggested , the invariant masses of jets are expected to play an increasingly important role at the lhc as a useful jet property . for example , jet masses can help to isolate events where individual jets correspond to essentially all of the decay products of boosted heavy objects ( say top quarks or @xmath118 bosons ) .",
    "it is helpful to set the stage for these analyses by discussing first the expected magnitude of masses of jets arising from perturbative qcd interactions only .",
    "we will return to the question of jet masses in section  [ sec : sparty ] where showering , hadronization and ue effects will be included . the nlo configurations with 2 partons in a jet , corresponding to @xmath119 and @xmath120 , 1 cone @xmath391 jet and 3 cones @xmath39 1 jet in fig .",
    "[ pertthy ] , will result in perturbative jets with nonzero masses . while the distribution of jet masses will be singular at the origin in perturbation theory , due to the soft and collinear singularities",
    ", the average jet mass ( squared ) is an infrared safe quantity that can be evaluated order - by - order in perturbation theory . in particular , to find the average jet mass squared for a fixed jet @xmath121 at nlo we simply evaluate the nlo inclusive jet cross section at that fixed @xmath121 weighted by the corresponding jet mass squared , where the evaluation involves a sum over all 2 partons - in - a - jet configurations with the required @xmath121 .",
    "we then divide this sum by the corresponding born level inclusive jet cross section .",
    "note that the notation for the perturbative order used here corresponds to the order of the jet cross section .",
    "thus at lo jets correspond to single partons with vanishing jet mass .",
    "as noted above , nlo jets receive contributions from 2 parton configurations with nonzero jet masses , with the masses proportional to a single power of @xmath122 . in detail",
    "this calculation is complicated due to the large number of perturbative processes that contribute and the fact that the available phase is restricted by the pdfs in a way that varies with @xmath123 . on the other hand ,",
    "the expected general form of the perturbative jet mass is straightforward to motivate . by dimensional analysis",

    "the search cone algorithm can act much like the seeds discussed earlier .",
    "in particular , the search cone algorithm can identify a ( small radius @xmath162 ) stable ( soft ) cone between two energetic cones arising from the soft gluon between 2 energetic partons configuration discussed earlier .  the soft search cone is stable exactly because it fits  between the two energetic partons without including either",
    "; the spacing between the two energetic partons can be in the range @xmath165 .",

    "the recommendation adopted in the tev4lhc workshop , and which we also endorse , is to remove the search cone from the midpoint cone algorithm and to substitute a `` second - pass '' step .",

    "there must be corrections for detector effects , for the splash - in contributions of the underlying event ( and pile - up ) and for the splash - out effects of hadronization ( and for showering when comparing to leading order calculations ) .",
    "it is the response to both the splash - in and splash - out effects that distinguishes the various cone algorithms and drives the issues we have just been discussing .",
    "it is also important to recognize that the splash - in and splash - out effects ( and corrections ) come with opposite signs and there can be substantial cancellation .",
    "we will return to the question of run ii  corrections below .",
    "the conclusion from the previous discussion is that it would be very helpful to include also a correction in the experimental analysis that accounts for the use of seeds , or to use a seedless cone algorithm such as siscone  @xcite .",
    "then these experimental results could be compared to perturbative results without seeds , avoiding the inherent infrared problems caused by seeds in perturbative analyses . at the same time , the analysis described above suggests that using the midpoint cone algorithm , to remove the impact of seeds at nlo , does not fully eliminate the impact of the smearing due to showering and hadronization , which serves to render the midpoint cone of fixed order perturbation theory unstable .",
    "the same may be true , but possibly to a lesser extent , with the use of a seedless algorithm such as siscone , which increases the number of identified stable cones .",
    "thus we should still not expect to be able to compare data to nlo theory with @xmath75 , although the impact may be somewhat reduced .",
    "the possible downside of finding more stable cones is that the split / merge step will play a larger role , with no analogue effect in the perturbative analysis .",
    "splitting the calorimeter towers with a host of low @xmath168 stable cones can serve to lower the @xmath168 of a leading jet and introduce an undesirable dependence on the minimum @xmath5 cut defining which stable cones are included in the split / merge process .",
    "this is surely only a percent level correction , but control at that level is the ultimate goal .      the last step before the detector in our factorized , approximate picture of a hard scattering event is the hadronization step .  here",
    "the colored partons arising from the hard scattering itself , from isr and fsr and from the ue are organized into color singlet hadrons .",
    "thus this step requires information about the color flow within the event as the event evolves from short to long distance , and that information must be maintained during the showering process .",
    "the initial color single hadrons will include resonances , which are then decayed into the long lifetime , long distance final hadrons ( primarily pions and kaons ) according to the known properties of the resonances .  essentially by definition , this step represents non - perturbative physics , is model dependent and therefore not well understood .",
    "on the other hand , by construction , it looks for minimal mass color singlet final states while conserving energy and momentum and so results in only a minimal kinematic rearrangement .",
    "thus , although there is considerable uncertainty about the details of hadronization , the impact on jet reconstruction is small and is fairly easily corrected for in both types of algorithms except perhaps at the lowest jet energies .  in experimental analyses , these corrections",
    "are estimated using leading - order parton - shower monte carlo generators , by observing the variation of the predicted jet cross sections after turning off the interaction between beam remnants and the hadronization .",
    "this procedure relies on the monte carlo providing a good description of those observables in the data that are most sensitive to non - perturbative contributions such as , for example , the underlying event energy away from jets and the internal structure of the jets .",
    "recent precise measurements on jet shapes  @xcite , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : shapes ] , have allowed the detailed study of the models employed to describe the underlying event in inclusive jet production at the tevatron ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "besides the contribution from the ue the jet shape is also sensitive to the changing character of the scattered parton , _",
    "i.e_. , gluons at low @xmath5 and quarks at high @xmath5 , and to the perturbative scaling of the jet size with @xmath169 .",
    "the tevatron studies , which will be discussed in more detail below , suggest that these last effects are reasonably well described both by the showers in monte carlo simulations and by pqcd analyses .",
    "future measurements of the underlying event in run ii , for different hadronic final states , promise to play a major role in the understanding of the measured jet cross sections at the lhc .",
    "overall the challenge for the future , as noted above , is to continue to reduce the systematic uncertainties below the current 10% to 50% level , which effectively guarantees agreement with theory .",
    "indeed , run ii studies of the corrections due to splash - in , _",
    "i.e_. , the underlying event ( and pile - up ) , and the splash - out corrections due to hadronization are much more sophisticated than in run i and presented in such a way that they can be applied either to the data ( corrected for the detector ) or to a theoretical ( perturbative ) calculation .",
    "the evaluation of these corrections is based on data and the standard monte carlos , pythia and herwig , especially tune a of pythia , which seems to accurately simulate the underlying event in terms of multiple parton interactions , including the observed correlations with the hard scattering process  @xcite .",
    "we turn now to a detailed discussion of the experiences and lessoned learned at the tevatron .",
    "most of the interesting physics processes in @xmath170 collisions at the tevatron include jets in the final state . therefore , the reconstruction and precise measurement of jets serve as key ingredients for the better understanding of hard scattering processes and for new physics searches at the tevatron .    as an example , consider top quark production .",
    "the top quark was discovered by the cdf and d  experiments in 1995  @xcite , and since then studies of the top quark production and properties have been considered to be one of the primary physics goals for the tevatron experiments .",
    "top quark decays always have at least one jet in the final state and the systematic uncertainty of the top quark mass measurement is dominated by the jet energy scale uncertainty .",
    "the search for the standard model higgs boson is also an important aspect of the tevatron physics program .",
    "the standard model higgs boson dominantly decays to @xmath171 for masses @xmath172 gev/_c_. the @xmath171 dijet mass resolution has been stressed as one of the critical factors in the search for a light higgs boson decay at the tevatron  @xcite ; a 20% decrease of @xmath173 is expected to be have a similar effect as a 20% increase in the accumulated luminosity .",
    "inclusive jet cross section measurements have also been undertaken at the tevatron .",
    "such measurements are sensitive to new physics such as quark compositeness and the presence of new heavy particles from beyond - the - standard - model scenarios , and also they provide crucial information on parton distribution functions for the proton .",
    "cdf and d  are the two general - purpose detectors designed for measurement of @xmath174 collisions at the fermilab tevatron collider .",
    "both detectors are composed of a solenoidal - magnet charged particle spectrometer surrounded by ( sampling ) calorimetry and a system of muon chambers .",
    "the components most relevant for jets are the calorimeters , which are used to measure the energy and angle of particles produced in @xmath174 collisions .",
    "the cdf and d  calorimeters both have a projective tower geometry as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdf_dzero_calorimeters ] .    [ t]c    the d  calorimeters are uranium and liquid argon sampling calorimeters .",

    "the d  calorimeters are nearly compensating , with an @xmath177 ratio less than 1.05 above 30 gev . the tower segmentation in @xmath178-@xmath7 space is @xmath179 .",
    "the average noise per channel is on the order of 50 mev .",
    "the relatively long charge collection time for the liquid argon signal and the resultant electronic shaping of the signal results in the possibility of towers with ( modest ) negative energy .",
    "the cdf electromagnetic ( em ) section consists of alternating layers of lead and scintillator , while the hadronic ( had ) section consists of alternating layers of steel and scintillator .",
    "the cdf calorimetry is divided into two main pseudorapidity ( @xmath180 ) regions ; the central calorimeter covers @xmath181 and the plug region covers @xmath182 .",
    "the region between the central and plug regions is covered by the end - wall hadron calorimeter which has a similar construction as the central hadron calorimeter .",
    "the tower size in the central region is @xmath183 , and the segmentation in the plug region varies as a function of @xmath178 ( @xmath184 for @xmath185 and with @xmath186 increasing for larger @xmath180 values ) .",
    "the noise level is very low , with only @xmath187 noise tower with @xmath188 mev being present per event .",
    "the @xmath168 threshold on each calorimeter tower used for jet reconstruction is 100 mev , and no special care is necessary for noise suppression .",
    "in contrast to leptons or photons , jets are clusters of objects  that have to be defined by a clustering algorithm , as discussed previously in this paper . in parton shower monte carlo events , a jet clustering algorithm can be applied to particles produced after hadronization of the partons , producing hadron - level jets ; for pqcd parton - level predictions , jets are formed by running the algorithm on partons from the fixed - order ( typically next - to - leading order ) pqcd event generator .",
    "experimentally , it is extremely challenging to both identify and measure the kinematic properties of the large variety of individual particles produced in high - energy hadronic collisions , especially with the relatively coarse calorimeter segmentation present in the tevatron experiments .  as a result jets are reconstructed by running the jet algorithm on the raw  energy depositions in the calorimeter towers , and not on the individual particles .",
    "the reconstruction and energy measurement of these `` calorimeter '' jets are affected by a variety of instrumental and physics effects .",
    "the instrumental effects include ( 1 ) calorimeter non - uniformity , ( 2 ) resolution effects due to large fluctuations in particle showering in the calorimeter , ( 3 ) non - linear response of the calorimeter , especially to hadrons , and ( 4 ) low momentum particles not reaching the calorimeter due to materials in front of the calorimeter and the solenoidal magnetic field . energy from additional @xmath189 interactions occurring in the same bunch crossing also affects the jet reconstruction and energy measurement .",
    "this has a non - negligible effect especially for low transverse momentum jets and high instantaneous luminosities .",
    "the situation is further complicated due to the fact that ( a ) the underlying event contributes energy to the jet cone , and that ( b ) the jet cone does not contain all the energy of the parent parton because of the effects of parton showering and hadronization",
    ". all of these effects have to be taken into account when comparing experimental data with theoretical predictions or extracting physics quantities of interest from experimental data .",
    "analyses take these physics effects into account in different manners . for example",
    ", in new physics searches or in measurements of top quark properties , attempts are often made to correct the jets measured in the calorimeters back to the parent parton from which the jet originated .",
    "extraction of the physics quantities of interest is done by comparing the data , after background subtraction , with signal events implemented in the parton shower monte carlo .    typically in jet cross section measurements ,",
    "the data are corrected to the hadron - level ( _ i.e. _ , corrected only for instrumental effects ) ; at this level , the results can be compared with hadron - level theoretical predictions without any knowledge of the detectors .",
    "we strongly encourage that , where possible , measurements at the tevatron or lhc produce results at this level ; often , instead the predictions from monte carlos are themselves passed through a detector simulation program and then directly compared to the `` raw '' data distributions .",
    "sometimes , the theoretical predictions from perturbative qcd calculations are available only at the parton level and then it is necessary to either correct the theory to the hadron level or the data to the parton level . for inclusive jet cross sections , the best theoretical predictions available , as of now ,",
    "are from next - to - leading order perturbative qcd calculations  @xcite . when making comparisons between experimental measurements and next - to - leading ( nlo ) order predictions , non - perturbative qcd effects from the underlying event and hadronization ( see section  [ sec : mctune ] for details ) are evaluated based on tuned parton shower monte carlos .",
    "note that a correction is not made for `` out - of - cone '' energy from hard gluon emission , as such effects are already ( at least partially ) taken into account in the nlo calculations . in these comparisons ,",

    "[ fig : jetflow ] shows a schematic overview on calorimeter jet reconstruction from towers and clusters in atlas , respectively .",
    "both calorimeter signal definitions have their specific advantages and disadvantages when used in jet reconstruction .",
    "any particular choice of the calorimeter signal has serious effects on jet reconstruction and calibration , though , as discussed more in the following sections .",
    "several jet calibration models are under investigation in atlas .",
    "the most commonly used model is based on a modified cell signal weighting technique , following the original suggestions from h1  @xcite .",
    "it can be applied to jets from towers as well jets from uncalibrated topological clusters .    in a first step ,",
    "the cell content of the tower or cluster jet is retrieved .",
    "then , a cell signal weighting function @xmath358 is applied for each cell , depending on its location @xmath359 and the cell signal density @xmath360 , where @xmath361 is the cell signal on an initial ( electromagnetic ) energy scale , and @xmath362 is the physical volume of the cell .",
    "finally , the jet kinematics is re - calculated using the now calibrated cell signals : @xmath363 with @xmath364 and @xmath365 .",
    "note that in this scenario the direction of the original jet can change .",
    "the weights can be determined using the particle `` truth '' jet in simulations by adjusting them such that the reconstructed jet energy on average is identical to the matched particle jet energy . in this scenario",
    "the weights reflect all corrections needed to reconstruct the particle jet . in particular , energy lost in particles which do not reach the calorimeter due to the magnetic field",
    "is compensated . in the same sense ,",
    "upstream energy losses in dead material are corrected by this normalization choice .",
    "using the calibrated topological clusters as input for jet finding makes the cell signal - based calibration in the jet context , as discussed above , obsolete . in this approach",
    "the cluster signals are already fully calibrated in a less biased context , as for example the jet algorithm choice does not enter into the hadronic calibration at this level ( see discussion at the end of section  [ sec : calojetbasics ] ) . to first order , the reconstructed jet kinematic",
    "is then given by the sum of the calibrated cluster four - momenta .",
    "note that the cluster calibration does not account for energy losses due to the magnetic field and some dead material , as obviously only energy losses with some correlation to the shape or magnitude of a nearby cluster signal can be corrected .",
    "especially energy lost away from any cluster , and energy losses due to the loss of small signals by the implicit noise suppression applied in the cell clustering algorithm , still need to be corrected for in the ( larger ) jet context .",
    "an attempt is under study in atlas to correct for these effects jet by jet , possibly using measurable jet shapes and detailed cluster information , but not all sensitivities and useful variables are yet fully understood to achieve a particle level calibration this way .",
    "important validation signals for jet calibration at the lhc , as at the tevatron , are prompt photons and hadronic @xmath118 decays . for systems which have a photon balancing one or more jet(s ) , corrections can be extracted from the @xmath5  balance .",
    "uncertainties in this procedure mostly arise from initial and final state radiation , and the underlying event activity , all of which may limit the applicability of these corrections in different collision topologies . the @xmath118 mass in @xmath366",
    "can be used for the same purpose .",
    "again , care is required when applying the corrections derived from the mass constraint to other physics topologies . at the lhc , most of the hadronically decaying @xmath118s in the recorded data",
    "will be reconstructed in the context of @xmath367 events , which are very busy final states with potentially large amounts of energy accidentally  scattered into the jet(s ) . also , the @xmath118 is color - disconnected from the rest of the event , which changes the general @xmath5  flow around its decay jets .",
    "reconstructed tracks from the inner tracking detectors in both atlas and cms , in principle , can be used to better calibrate and characterize a given reconstructed jet .",
    "classical energy flow based reconstruction techniques combine a track with the calorimeter response ( typically one cluster ) and make use of the feature that the track provides much better energy resolution than the calorimeter for lower energy particles .",
    "the application of these techniques promises considerable improvement in the kinematic reconstruction of a single isolated particle like an electron or @xmath368 ; the application to jets is still under study . in particular , the subtraction  of the charged response from the calorimeter jet signal is much more challenging due to the already mentioned overlap of showers and generally high tracker occupancy in the jet case .",
    "there are indications , however , that the fraction @xmath369 of the jet energy carried by ( reconstructed ) charged tracks into a jet is already a useful variable to refine the jet calibration , even without individual track / cluster matching .",
    "if @xmath369 is large for a given jet , the corresponding calorimeter response has a larger contribution from hadronic showers and may deserve additional calibration corrections to improve the jet energy scale , especially with a precision requirement at the level of @xmath287 .",
    "both atlas and cms use the iterative seeded cone jet finder with @xmath370 ( atlas ) and @xmath371 ( atlas and cms ) , and the @xmath0  jet finder with @xmath372 and @xmath373 ( atlas ) , and @xmath374 in cms .",
    "other jet algorithms are generally available and under study in particular with respect to certain physics needs ( see the discussion in section [ sec : sparty ] ) .",
    "the software is implemented such that exactly the same code runs on all possible input objects ( partons and hadrons from monte carlo generators , detector signals like clusters , towers , reconstructed tracks , etc . ) , as long as those represent a full four - momentum measure .",

    "the change of the jet shape clearly depends on the calorimeter signal definition .",

    "[ fig : jetshape ] .",
    "the tower picture of this particular final state shows rather large jets in general , especially when compared to the hadron jet .",
    "this is partly a consequence of the re - summation discussed above , but also due to the fact that towers especially in the endcap and forward regions are filled with signals more generated by the lateral shower development ( see jet @xmath377 in fig .  [",
    "fig : jetshape ] ) than the hadron energy flow .",
    "topological clusters , on the other hand , collect spatially distributed cell signals , as can again be seen very well in jet @xmath377 . in the cluster picture this jet is very collimated in rapidity , and consists of only two clusters .",

    "[ fig : nc ] indicates that in the central region of atlas the cell sizes , even though small in @xmath381 and @xmath7 , are comparably big with respect to shower sizes , while in the endcap region the cell sizes get sufficiently small , thus improving the structural resolution power of the cluster jets .",
    "( @xmath382 ) , for @xmath0  jets from particles , towers , and clusters ( @xmath373 ) , as a function of the jet mass calculated from all constituents.,width=453 ]    one of the more interesting jet variables is its mass .",
    "the ability to reconstruct this mass within reasonable precision has considerable impact on the general reconstruction of heavily boosted systems like the top quark , where all final state decay products may end up within a typical jet cone . in this case",

    "the mass reconstruction is still nearly perfect at the hadronization level , at least if all final state particles belonging to a given parton are efficiently collected by the chosen jet algorithm .",
    "reconstructing the mass from calorimeter signals is much more challenging in that not only the showering and the resulting signal overlap in the calorimeters smear the mass measurement considerably , but also the fact that the solenoidal fields in front of the calorimeters ( @xmath281 t in atlas , @xmath282 t in cms ) bend charged particles with @xmath383 mev@xmath61 away from the detectors , _",
