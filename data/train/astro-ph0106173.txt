    "radio source surveys are ideal tools for studying the distant universe , since they are unaffected by dust obscuration and detect large numbers of galaxies over a wide span of cosmic epochs ( the median redshift of galaxies detected in radio surveys is typically @xmath6 ; condon 1989 ) .    at 1.4ghz flux densities above about 50mjy , more than 95% of radio sources are classical radio galaxies and quasars powered by active nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "below 50mjy , the agn proportion declines and an increasing fraction of the faint radio source population is identified with star  forming galaxies ( e.g. condon 1989 , 1992 ) .",
    "these are usually disk galaxies , sometimes interacting with neighbours , in which the radio emission arises mainly through synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons accelerated by supernova explosions .",
    "thus radio surveys to levels of a few mjy probe both the agn population and a population of star  forming galaxies .",
    "it is important to be able to separate these , in order to determine the local space density and redshift evolution of each population .    a new generation of radio imaging surveys ( nvss , condon et al .",
    "1998 ; first , becker , white & helfand 1995 ; wenss , rengelink et al .",
    "1997 ; sumss , bock , large & sadler 1999 ) is now covering the whole sky to sensitivities of a few mjy .",
    "radio source counts from such surveys potentially yield important information on the cosmological evolution of active and star  forming galaxies ( e.g. longair 1966 , jauncey 1975 , wall et al .",
    "1980 ) , but their interpretation is strongly model  dependent .",
    "the scientific return from large radio surveys is enormously increased if the optical counterparts of the radio sources can be identified , their optical spectra classified ( as agn , starburst galaxy , etc . ) and their redshift distribution measured . in the past , however , this was a slow and tedious process which could only be carried out for relatively small samples .",
    "now , fibre  fed optical spectrographs make it possible to carry out spectroscopy of complete samples of hundreds of thousands of galaxies in the local universe . the anglo ",
    "australian observatory s two  degree field ( 2df ) spectrograph can observe up to 400 galaxies simultaneously over a 2@xmath7-diameter region of sky ( lewis et al .",
    "2001 , see also www.aao.gov.au/2df/ ) .",
    "a six  degree field ( 6df ) spectrograph will be commissioned on the aao s schmidt telescope in 2001 , with 150 fibres over a 6@xmath7-diameter field , and in the northern hemisphere the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) has begun a program of spectroscopy of 10@xmath8 galaxies .",
    "cross  matching radio continuum surveys with these new optical redshift surveys will provide redshifts and spectroscopic data for tens of thousands of local radio  emitting galaxies , rather than the few hundred available at present .",
    "two recent studies show the potential of these new redshift surveys .",
    "machalski & condon ( 1999 ) identified 1157 galaxies in the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ) with nvss radio sources above 2.5mjy at 1.4ghz .",
    "they attempted to determine the radio and infrared properties of galaxies in the lcrs redshift range of @xmath9 , but had difficulties because the lcrs was sparsely sampled , with optical spectra only being taken for about one galaxy in three .",
    "nevertheless , machalski & godlowski ( 2000 ) used the lcrs to derive the local radio luminosity function for both agn and star  forming galaxies , and to test for evolution over the lcrs redshift range .",
    "sadler et al .  ( 1999 ) cross  matched the nvss radio catalogue with the first thirty fields observed in the 2dfgrs , and found that it was usually straightforward to tell from the optical spectra whether the radio emission arose from star formation or an agn ( unlike lcrs , the 2dfgrs has a spectroscopic completeness of 95% ) .",
    "the present paper is the second in a series analysing the properties of nvss radio sources which are identified with galaxies in the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; colless 1999 , colless et al .",
    "2001 , see also www.mso.edu.au/2dfgrs/ ) . when complete , the 2dfgrs will yield good  quality optical spectra for up to 4000 radio  emitting galaxies in the redshift range @xmath10 to 0.4 .",
    "such a large sample should allow us to disentangle the effects of age , orientation and luminosity in the local agn population , as well as providing a definitive measurement of the local radio luminosity function ( rlf ) for active and star  forming galaxies .",
    "our first paper ( sadler et al .",
    "1999 ; hereafter paper i ) , was a preliminary investigation of a small sample of the early 2dfgrs data , and showed that the 2dfgrs radio  source population is composed of roughly similar numbers of agn and star  forming galaxies . in this paper",
    "we analyse a 2dfgrs data set which is almost an order of magnitude larger than in paper i , and use it to derive the local radio luminosity function for active and star  forming galaxies at 1.4ghz .",
    "the spectra analysed in this paper are included in the first public release of 2dfgrs data , which took place in june 2001 .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we use @xmath11 = 50 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 and @xmath12=1 .",
    "in this paper , we analyse 2dfgrs spectra from the first two years of the survey , i.e. up to may 1999 .",
    "observations made before october 1997 were excluded because the instrument was still in a commissioning phase and the data are of variable quality .",
    "the data set analysed here comprises 210 fields , or about 20% of the total 2dfgrs area .",
    "the original selection of 2dfgrs optical targets included all non - stellar objects brighter than @xmath13 from the photographic ukst southern sky survey , and should involve no explicit biases so far as radio properties are concerned .",
    "the 2dfgrs uses a tiling algorithm with variable overlap depending on the underlying galaxy density .",
    "some 2dfgrs fields are also shared with a parallel qso redshift survey , so calculating the exact area of sky observed is not straightforward until the whole survey is complete .",
    "we therefore use the method described by folkes et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and estimate the area of sky covered by dividing the number of galaxies observed by the mean surface density of galaxies in the target list .",
    "the data set observed in the period october 1997may 1999 inclusive contains 58,454 2dfgrs targets . taking the folkes et al .",
    "surface density of 180 galaxies deg@xmath14 to the survey limit of @xmath15mag .",
    "gives an effective area of 325 deg@xmath16 for the data set we will analyse here .",
    "we cross  matched the 2dfgrs catalogue positions with the nvss radio catalogue and took all matches with position offsets of 15 arcsec or less as candidate radio detections .",
    "this yielded a total of 927 observations of 903 targets .",
    "not all these will be true identifications  as discussed in paper i , we expect most unresolved radio sources with offsets of 10 arcsec or less to be true associations with 2dfgrs galaxies , along with a smaller ( and quantifiable ) fraction of sources with offsets of 1015arcsec .",
    "there are also three classes of objects for which the situation is more complex : ( i ) extended ( resolved ) nvss radio sources , ( ii ) radio sources which are resolved by nvss into two or more distinct components , and ( iii ) radio sources associated with nearby bright galaxies ( b@xmath17mag ) . as we discuss in section 4 , these received extra attention to determine whether to accept a candidate i d as a correct one .    for completeness , and",
    "because others may wish to use our data with different selection criteria for radio  source ids , we have tabulated 2dfgrs spectral types and redshifts for all 912 candidate radio  source ids with radio  optical offsets of 15.0arcsec or less .",
    "we showed in paper i that , with the exception of a small number of double nvss radio sources ( see section 4.2 ) , there should be very few correct ids with radio  optical offsets larger than 15arcsec .",
    "this is confirmed in fig .",
    "1 , which shows that by 15arcsec from the 2df position the number of candidate detections falls to the level expected from chance coincidences alone .",
    "we also note that the 2dfgrs input catalogue is incomplete for galaxies brighter than @xmath18 , and so some bright , nearby galaxies are missing from the 2dfgrs .",
    "almost all these missing galaxies should already have redshift measurements , and can be added back into the sample once the entire 2dfgrs is complete . in calculating luminosity functions ( see section 8) , we correct for the absence of these bright galaxies .",
    "as noted earlier , the spectra analysed in this paper were collected as the 2dfgrs progressed , and cover the period to may 1999 . most of these spectra are included in the first ( mid2001 ) public release of 2dfgrs data ( see colless et al .",
    "2001 for details of the public  release database ) . in a few cases ,",
    "a new spectrum taken after may 1999 may be better than the one used here and will replace it in the final database .",
    "although in most cases the public  release data are identical to those analysed here , some values of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and q listed in table 1 may change .",
    "this is because there have been revisions of the @xmath19  magnitude scale , and a re - reduction of all the early 2dfgrs redshifts , since we began our analysis . in the great majority of cases , the database revisions produced no significant difference , especially for spectra with q@xmath213 .",
    "small changes in the values of @xmath19 or @xmath20 for individual galaxies will not affect the overall results of the analysis which follows .",
    "2dfgrs spectra of each of the 912 candidate radio  source ids were examined and classified visually by one of us ( ems ) . as in paper",
    "i , each spectrum was classified as either ` agn ' or ` star  forming ' ( sf ) based on its 2df spectrum .",
    "agn galaxies have either an absorption  line spectrum like that of a giant elliptical galaxy ( these we classed ` aa ' ) ; an absorption  line spectrum with weak liner  like emission lines ( class ` aae ' ) , or a stellar continuum dominated by nebular emission lines such as [ oii ] and [ oiii ] which are strong compared with any balmer  line emission ( class ` ae ' ) . `",
    "sf ' galaxies are those where strong , narrow emission lines of h@xmath22 and ( usually ) h@xmath23 dominate the spectrum",
    ". objects where the spectra were too noisy for reliable classification are classed as ` ? ? ' .",
    "there are several independent tests of the reliability of our visual classification of the spectra : ( a ) the visual clasifications generally agree well with the results of principal components analysis ( pca ) methods , as we will show in section 3.3 , ( b ) for galaxies with optical emission lines , our ae / sf classifications agree well with those derived by jackson & londish ( 2000 ) from diagnostic emission  line ratios , and ( c ) most galaxies which we classify as sf are detected by iras and fall on the radio  fir correlation ( see section 6 ) , whereas none of the galaxies we classified as aa are detected by iras .",
    "thus we are confident that our visual classification of the 2dfgrs spectra allows us to distinguish agn and star  forming galaxies in a consistent and reliable way .",
    "table 1 lists the entire sample of 912 candidate radio ids , i.e. the 903 2dfgrs targets whose catalogued position is within 15arcsec of the catalogued position of an nvss radio source , together with a further nine extended and double radio sources which were identified separately as described in section 4.2 .",
    "the table columns are as follows :    * 2dfgrs galaxy name ( this is the name used in the 2dfgrs database ) .",
    "an asterisk following the name indicates that this galaxy appears in the notes at the end of table 1 .",
    "* other name  we have cross  identified with other galaxy catalogues where possible . * the optical position ( j2000.0 ) at which the 2dfgrs fibre was placed . * the offset between 2dfgrs ( optical ) and nvss ( radio ) positions , in arcsec . *",
    "total blue ( @xmath19 ) magnitude , from the 2dfgrs database .",
    "the magnitudes listed here are taken from the may 2000 version of the database . * total radio flux density at 1.4ghz , from the nvss catalogue ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) . where a source is split into more than one component in the nvss catalogue , this is indicated in the notes at the end of the table and the value quoted here is the sum of all the components . * iras 60@xmath24 m flux density ( in jy ) , where listed in the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "although iras surveyed 97% of the sky , the incompleteness near the galactic poles is larger than in other areas .",
    "based on the iras sky coverage plots given by beichman et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , about 10% of the 2dfgrs survey area had either one or no iras scans and so was not catalogued .",
    "the main 2dfgrs areas missed by iras lie in the region between 10 and 11h ra in the northern zone and 23 and 0h ra in the southern zone , but there are also smaller gaps elsewhere .",
    "* heliocentric redshift , from 2dfgrs observations unless otherwise indicated in the notes .",
    "* 2dfgrs spectrum quality code q , where q=4 or 5 are excellent ",
    "quality spectra , q=3 acceptable and q=0 , 1 or 2 poor  quality . galaxies with q@xmath253 are excluded from further analysis because their redshifts are highly uncertain .",
    "checks against repeat observations and published redshifts show that 2dfgrs redshifts with q=3 are about 90% reliable and those with q=4 or 5 are 99% reliable ( colless et al .",
    "* spectral class , based on our visual classification .",
    "we would eventually like to compare the 2dfgrs radio  emitting galaxies with the parent sample from which they are drawn ( in order to answer questions like `` what fraction of seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies are radio  loud , and how does this vary with redshift ? '' ) , so we compared our simple visual classification of the spectra ( as aa , ae or sf ) with the principal components analysis ( pca ) methods developed for use with the 2dfgrs by folkes et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and madgwick et al .",
    "pca is an automatic method of classifying spectra which has the great advantages of being objective , quantitative and easily applied to very large samples .",
    "a series of principal components or eigenspectra ( pc1 , pc2 , ... ) are determined from the distribution of all the spectra in a very large multi ",
    "dimensional space ; most of the information in the spectra is included in the first few pcs .",
    "this means that each spectrum can be well  represented by a set of just 3 or 4 numbers , corresponding to the relative power in the dominant pcs .",
    "we find good agreement between the visual and automatic methods of classifying galaxy spectra .",
    "for example , in a plot of pc3 against pc1 ( fig .",
    "2 ) there is a clear separation between the different visual spectral types . by combining similar plots involving pc2",
    ", it looks as if it will be possible to define an almost unique mapping between the two classification methods , making it easy to compare the properties of the 1.5% of the galaxies which are radio sources with the full 2dfgrs sample of up to 250,000 optical galaxies .",
    "3 shows how the composition of the 2dfgrs radio sources changes with redshift .",
    "as we showed in paper i , star  forming galaxies dominate the population at low redshift while active galaxies dominate above @xmath26 .",
    "this is because star  forming galaxies are low ",
    "luminosity radio sources ( p@xmath27 w hz@xmath3 ) which drop out of the sample when they fall below the nvss radio detection limit .",
    "conversely , most agn have higher radio luminosities and remain in the sample out to @xmath28 where they finally drop below the 2dfgrs optical magnitude limit .",
    "interestingly , the fraction of emission - line agn ( ae ) galaxies remains roughly constant ( at 1015% ) throughout the sample volume even though the overall agn fraction increases dramatically with redshift .",
    "we need to keep in mind , however , that the 2arcsec diameter 2df fibres include an increasing fraction of the total galaxy light for more distant galaxies ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . as a result , galaxies with emission",
    " line nuclei will be easier to recognise at lower redshift , where there is less dilution from the surrounding stellar galaxy , than at higher redshift .",
    "we therefore assume that the probability of recognizing a galaxy as ae rather than aa varies with redshift , and so we combine the aa and ae classes in most of our later analysis .    in star ",
    "forming galaxies , the line emission is expected to come mainly from an extended disk and dilution of the emission ",
    "line flux with redshift is less likely .",
    "indeed we might expect star ",
    "forming galaxies to be easier to recognise at higher redshift since the 2df aperture includes a larger fraction of the total disk light .",
    "we now need to determine which of the candidate radio source identifications in table 1 are real associations between a 2dfgrs galaxy and an nvss radio source .",
    "this is not always straightforward  as noted in paper i , we expect some chance coincidences even at the smallest radio  optical separations . in paper",
    "i , we used a simple 10arcsec cutoff as the criterion for association .",
    "although this will include a few objects which are not real associations and exclude some which are , the _ number _  of such objects can be quantified statistically and taken into account when calculating the luminosity function .",
    "we use a similar 10arcsec cutoff here , but also recognise that a simple cutoff may exclude some extended sources with complex radio structure .",
    "thus we also inspected radio  optical overlays of all the extended sources in the candidate list and accepted some of these as genuine ids even though the radio  optical offset was larger than 10 arcsec .",
    "about 25% of the candidate nvss/2dfgrs radio sources are resolved by the 45arcsec nvss beam , giving us an estimate of their linear size . in most such cases",
    "we still see a single radio source , but with an apparent size larger than 45arcsec in at least one dimension . for these galaxies , the nvss radio position",
    "is calculated by fitting a two  dimensional gaussian to the radio image .",
    "if the fit is not perfect , the quoted position may have a much larger uncertainly than that of an unresolved radio source of similar flux density .",
    "for all extended nvss sources with radio  optical offsets in the range 10.015.0arcsec , we inspected overlays of the radio contours onto dss images ( see fig . 5 for examples ) .",
    "if the optical galaxy lay along the major axis of the extended radio source , or the radio emission appeared to be symmetric about the optical galaxy , we accepted this as a correct i d .",
    "a few nvss radio sources are resolved into two or more distinct components , so we need to be able to recognise these , and to search for an optical i d near the radio centroid rather than at the position of each individual component .",
    "we first identified all the candidate double radio sources in the nvss catalogue by using the semi  empirical link  length measure defined by magliocchetti et al .",
    "a pair of radio sources are defined to be associated if : + ( i ) the ratio of their flux densities s@xmath29 and s@xmath30 lies in the range 0.25 @xmath25 ( s@xmath29/s@xmath30 ) @xmath25 4.0 , _ and _ + ( ii ) the projected separation of the two radio components is smaller than their link length @xmath31 , which is calculated from the total flux density in mjy and defined as : @xmath32^{0.5}\\ \\times 100\\ , { \\rm arcsec}.\\ ] ]    this yielded a total of 525 candidate nvss doubles in the 1700deg@xmath16 region of sky covered by the 2dfgrs . of these , 59 had a 2dfgrs galaxy within 30arcsec of the radio centroid and 17 of these galaxies had spectra taken up to 1999 may .",
    "these objects were then inspected to see whether the optical galaxy lay on or near the radio axis of the nvss double . as a result",
    ", eight new 2dfgrs galaxies were added to the sample as optical hosts of nvss doubles .",
    "these are listed at the end of table 1 , along with an unusual diffuse source , tentatively identified with tgn307z092 , which is discussed in section 5.2 .",
    "these nine extra galaxies bring the total number of candidate nvss/2dfgrs matches to 912 ( of these , 56% are agn and 35% sf galaxies ) .",
    "we paid special attention to the brightest 2dfgrs galaxies ( @xmath33mag ) . for these bright galaxies ,",
    "the radio  optical offset alone is not always a reliable indicator of whether the galaxy is associated with an nvss radio source .",
    "there are three reasons for this : ( i ) it can be difficult to measure an accurate optical position for these galaxies from schmidt plates since the central regions are often over  exposed , ( ii ) we found that the 2dfgrs fibre positions used for bright galaxies were sometimes offset from what appeared to be the optical nucleus , and ( iii ) much of the radio emission in these galaxies arises from star formation ",
    "related processes in a resolved disk ( see section 5 for more details ) , so that the centroid of the radio emission can be offset by several arcsec from the galaxy nucleus .",
    "we therefore inspected radio overlays on dss images of all galaxies brighter than mag 17.0 and accepted those with 10.015.0 arcsec offsets as correct ids if the radio emission appeared to be roughly centred on the optical galaxy .",
    "when this was done , it is noted in the final column of table 1 .",
    "our final sample of accepted nvss/2dfgrs ids comprises all sources with radio  optical offsets of 10.0arcsec or less , along with nine additional double galaxies described above and 47 additional galaxies with radio  optical offsets of 10.015.0 ( 28 of them radio sources associated with optically  bright galaxies , and 19 extended radio sources ) .",
    "this gives a final sample of 757 ` accepted ' nvss/2dfgrs ids which we use in further analysis .",

    "we have shown how combining data from large radio continuum and optical redshift surveys allows us to derive accurate local radio luminosity functions ( rlfs ) for agn and star  forming ( sf ) galaxies . both agn and star  forming",
    "galaxies are significant contributors to the local rlf below @xmath34 whz@xmath3 ( at higher radio powers , almost all the sources are agn ) , so good - quality optical spectra are needed to classify the radio sources correctly .",
    "this paper establishes an accurate local benchmark for future studies of the cosmic evolution of both agn and star  forming galaxies at higher redshift .",
    "the full data set of @xmath35 radio  source spectra which will become available when the 2dfgrs is completed should be large enough to measure the evolution of radio galaxies to @xmath36 and the most luminous star  forming galaxies to @xmath37 .",
    "we showed in section 6 that there may be a substantial local population of radio  luminous star  forming galaxies ( with implied star  formation rates of 50m@xmath2yr@xmath3 or more ) which are not seen in h@xmath22 emission  line surveys . determining whether these `` high sfr '' galaxies are dust  enshrouded starbursts or misclassified agn is important if we are to have an accurate census of star formation in the local universe ( if they are indeed starbursts , the `` high sfr galaxies '' contribute about 20% of the local star  formation density ) .",
    "high  resolution radio imaging , together with infrared spectroscopy , should allow us to determine whether the radio emission seen by nvss arises mainly from dusty star  forming regions .",
    "optical spectra of the remaining nvss / rosat sources in the 2dfgrs area ( see section 7 ) would be valuable in determining whether some radio agn have been excluded from the 2dfgrs because they have a bright nucleus which leads to them being classified as stars rather than galaxies on sky survey plates .",
    "we estimate that no more than five or six potential members of the current sample have been excluded in this way , but it would be useful to confirm this .      since the overlap between 2dfgrs galaxies and nvss radio sources is relatively small  about 5% of nvss radio sources in the 2dfgrs area are associated with 2dfgrs galaxies , and 12% of 2dfgrs galaxies are detected by nvss  it is tempting to speculate on what could be achieved with deeper radio and optical observations in the 2dfgrs area .",
    "radio observations to sub  mjy sensitivities at 1.4ghz would increase the detection rate for galaxies in the 2dfgrs sample , particularly for star  forming galaxies since many of these lie close to the 2.8mjy nvss detection limit ( see section 3.4 ) .",
    "for example , observations with a 3@xmath38 detection limit of 0.4mjy at 1.4ghz could detect galaxies with a star ",
    "formation rate of @xmath39m@xmath2yr@xmath3 at @xmath40 , which is significantly lower than the limit of @xmath41m@xmath2yr@xmath3 at the same redshift for galaxies near the nvss detection limit of 2.8mjy .",
    "about 30% of all nvss radio sources have an optical counterpart visible on the digitised sky survey ( i.e. brighter than @xmath42mag ) .",
    "deep 2df spectroscopy should be possible to @xmath43mag ( and even fainter for emission ",
    "line objects ) with integration times of 48 hours rather than the 4060 minutes used by the 2dfgrs , and careful attention to sky  subtraction techniques ( cannon 2001 ) .",
    "this would allow spectroscopy of the host galaxies of powerful agn ( and hence studies of their cosmic evolution ) to redshifts of @xmath44 rather than the @xmath45 limit of the 2dfgrs .",
    "20 shows the local radio luminosity functions ( rlfs ) for star  forming ( sf ) galaxies and agn over the whole range in radio power for which data are currently available .",
    "the two rlfs cross over ( i.e. agn and sf galaxies contribute equally to the local radio  source population ) at p@xmath46 whz@xmath3 . both agn and sf galaxies contribute at least 20% of the radio  source population over the range @xmath47whz@xmath3 .",

    "suggests that all @xmath24jy  level radio surveys should find a mixture of agn and star  forming galaxies at all redshifts , i.e. there is no observational regime in which we can simply assume that a faint radio source arises from a starburst .",
    "deep radio continuum surveys in the hubble deep field ( richards et al .  1998 ; garrett et al .",
    "2000 ) suggest that the @xmath24jy radio  source population is composed of a mixture of 7090% spiral and irregular / merging galaxies and 1030% ellipticals .",
    "a mixture of star  forming galaxies and agn is probably present even at flux densities below 1@xmath24jy  hopkins et al .",
    "( 2000 ) remark that in their simulations of the faint radio  source population to a flux density limit of 0.1@xmath24jy , the proportion of agn is still significant .",
    "if this is true , then optical / ir spectroscopy will play a key role in disentangling the faint radio  source population probed by future deep radio surveys , and partnerships between radio and optical telescopes in mapping out the distant universe will increase in importance in the years to come .",
