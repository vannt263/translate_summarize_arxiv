    "geometrically frustrated spin systems hold promise for finding new phases of matter , such as classical and quantum spin liquid ground states . of considerable interest",

    "since such techniques require a material which can remain in a disordered , paramagnetic state to very low temperatures ( rather than undergoing a phase transition to an ordered state ) , this makes geometrically frustrated spin systems attractive for such applications .",
    "recently , a new class of two - dimensional magnetic materials @xmath0 ( cpa=2-carboxypentonic acid , a derivative of ascorbic acid ; x = f , cl , br )  @xcite was fabricated in which cu spins reside on a triangular kagome lattice ( tkl ) , formed by inserting an extra set of triangles ( @xmath1-trimers ) inside of the kagome triangles ( @xmath2-trimers ) .",

    "the cu spins in @xmath0 likely have isotropic heisenberg interactions , for which exact solutions are currently inaccessible on a frustrated lattice .",
    "however , in the limit where spins on @xmath2-trimers have ising character , it is still possible to take into account the quantum fluctuations on @xmath1-trimers _ exactly _ through a mapping to the kagome ising model . in the presence of applied field , the model maps to the kagome ising model with three - spin interactions .",
    "we present exact results for the phase diagram at all temperatures without applied field , and at zero temperature in the presence of applied field .    in the absence of applied field ,",
    "the zero temperature phase diagram is richer than the case where both @xmath1 and @xmath2 spins are in the ising limit .",
    "the ordered phase survives quantum fluctuations , but for large enough transverse coupling , there is a first order transition to a state with lower total spin on the @xmath1-trimers . for the disordered phase , the quantum fluctuations of the @xmath1-spins partially lift the ground state degeneracy . in the presence of applied field ,",
    "the phase diagram is even more rich .",

    "when @xmath20 , this model reduces to the ising model on the tkl , which was studied exhaustively in ref .",
    "( see also ref .  . )",
    "the @xmath17 terms permit transverse quantum fluctuations within each @xmath1-trimer .",
    "however , the quantum fluctuations are confined to reside within the @xmath1-trimers , as can be seen by the fact that the total @xmath21 of each @xmath1-trimer is a conserved quantity .    in spite of the frustrated nature of the model",
    ", it turns out that it can be exactly solved at all temperatures for @xmath22 and at zero temperature for finite @xmath13 .",

    "the energy diagonalization is particularly simple since the total @xmath33 of each @xmath1-trimer is a good quantum number . in the case where the surrounding @xmath2-spins are in the @xmath34 or @xmath35 configurations , total @xmath36 is also conserved . due to the local @xmath37 symmetry of each hexamer , @xmath38 .",

    "this agrees with the intuition that when the system is tuned to a phase transition line or point , the system is able to access states from both adjacent phases , and therefore the entropy is higher than that of the surrounding phases .",
    "[ f:3dphase ] shows the entire finite temperature phase diagram as a function of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "apart from the i(3/2 ) to i(1/2 ) ground state transition , which corresponds only to a change in the local physics , it is clear that all of the phase transitions survive at finite temperature .",
    "not surprisingly , as temperature is increased , the disordered phase becomes a larger part of the phase diagram .",
    "based on experimental data on the tkl magnets @xmath0 ,  @xcite , it is sensible to make the following assumptions : @xmath16 and @xmath17 are antiferromagnetic ( @xmath48 ) , and @xmath49 . at",
    "zero applied field , this would put these materials in the disordered phase .",

    "this ferromagnetic phase of the @xmath2-spins is further subdivided into two @xmath52 phases by the line @xmath53 ( see fig .",
    "[ f : ising - heisenberg - phase - diagram ] ) , corresponding to different @xmath1-trimer configurations . in the phase i(3/2 ) , the @xmath1-trimers are in a unique ground state with total spin value @xmath54 and total @xmath55-component of spin @xmath56 . in the phase i(1/2 ) , the @xmath1-trimers are in a unique ground state with total spin value @xmath54 and total @xmath55-component of spin @xmath57 . on the phase boundary , these two states become degenerate , and each @xmath1-trimer is two - fold degenerate , with an associated @xmath52 entropy of @xmath58 . at finite temperature , the transition from i(3/2 ) to i(1/2 ) becomes a crossover , since the difference between phases i(3/2 ) and i(1/2 ) is the local configuration of each @xmath1-trimer .",
    "this crossover , which is evident in the region @xmath53 in fig .",
    "[ f:3dphase ] , should be accompanied by a relatively sharp peak in the entropy near the @xmath52 phase boundary . from the figure",
    ", it can also be seen that the i(3/2 ) phase is more robust than the i(1/2 ) phase , in that it has a higher transition temperature .",
    "this can be qualitatively understood as follows .",
    "in phase i , the effective coupling @xmath59 at @xmath52 is determined by @xmath60 .",
    "far into phase i ( large @xmath61 ) , the @xmath1-trimer ground state is locked in its @xmath62 configuration , and @xmath60 can be calculated by perturbation theory to be @xmath19 for i(3/2 ) and @xmath63 for i(1/2 ) .",
    "thus , i(3/2 ) has a larger @xmath59 than i(1/2 ) and therefore a larger transition temperature .",
    "let us consider going from phase i(1/2 ) to phase ix across the phase boundary v. figure [ f : energy - levels - of - a - trimer ] shows the eight energy levels of an @xmath1-trimer , for the two symmetry - distinct configurations of the @xmath2-spins ( @xmath41 and @xmath64 ) , with @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the most important feature of the graph is how @xmath67 compares with @xmath68 , along with their respective degeneracies .",
    "starting from phase i(1/2 ) , as @xmath17 is decreased towards @xmath69 , the difference between @xmath67 and @xmath68 decreases until they become equal at the full ising limit ( phase v ) , @xmath70 .",
    "the ground state of the @xmath1-trimer is triply degenerate in this limit , regardless of the configuration of the @xmath2-spins .",
    "because of this , the effective coupling between @xmath2-spins goes to zero , @xmath71 .",
    "this was noted in our previous paper@xcite on the ising limit of the tkl model , along with the corresponding ground state entropy of @xmath72 per tkl unit cell in the ising limit .",
    "now turn on an antiferromagnetic transverse coupling @xmath73 to go into phase ix .",
    "the lowest energy remains independent of the @xmath2-spin configurations .",
    "notice , though , that the lowest eigenvalue of the @xmath34 subspace is doubly degenerate , whereas the lowest eigenvalue of the @xmath74 subspace is nondegenerate . in the @xmath34 subspace of the @xmath2 spins ,",
    "the lowest @xmath1-trimer energy state in this region has @xmath9 , @xmath57 , and there are two independent states with these quantum numbers .",
    "they are degenerate because the surrounding ( @xmath41 ) @xmath2-spins couple to the @xmath1-spins through @xmath33 only .",
    "when the @xmath2-spins are in the @xmath74 configuration , this degeneracy is broken .",
    "this means that at zero temperature , the @xmath34 configuration of the @xmath2-spins is twice as likely to occur as the @xmath74 configuration .",
    "the zero temperature effective coupling constant between @xmath2-spins is therefore @xmath75 .    to get a fuller picture of what is happening , we plot the effective coupling @xmath76 as a function of temperature in fig .  [",
    "f : betajbb ] .",
    "we see that as long as quantum fluctuations are present ( i.e. @xmath17 is finite ) , the value of @xmath76 increases monotonically as @xmath18 is lowered , approaching a constant value @xmath77 as @xmath78 .",
    "this value is less than the critical coupling of the kagome ising ferromagnet , @xmath79 .",
    "therefore phase ix is disordered at all temperatures .",
    "the entropy in phase ix is @xmath4 per unit cell .",
    "it exists precisely at @xmath22 and @xmath80 .",
    "note that in deviating from the ising antiferromagnetic limit ( i.e. phase v ) by adding quantum fluctuations , the entropy decreases .",
    "next we consider crossing the phase boundary from i(3/2 ) to ix through viii . along the line viii",
    ", we again have @xmath81 . the difference from ix",
    ", however , is that when the @xmath2-spins are in the @xmath34 configuration , the @xmath82 state of the @xmath1-trimer is also degenerate with the two @xmath83 states .",
    "this leads to a larger value of @xmath84 , and hence a longer @xmath52 correlation length , than phase ix . nevertheless , this value of @xmath85 is still below that of the critical value of the kagome ising model , and the ground state remains disordered .    if we are in phase ix close to the line phase viii , the @xmath1-trimer ground state when the surrounding @xmath2-spins are all up is doubly degenerate , with a small gap to the @xmath54 state . if the temperature is now increased , then this low - lying excited state will have non - zero boltzmann weight , and hence the value of @xmath86 will first increase before decreasing again at higher temperature due to the effects of thermal disordering .",
    "thus , the change of @xmath86 and hence the @xmath2-spin correlation length with temperature will be non - monotonic , first increasing with temperature before decreasing .",
    "this is a manifestation of the order - by - disorder mechanism commonly seen in frustrated systems with residual ground state entropy .",
    "we now consider the xxz - ising model on the tkl in the presence of finite magnetic field .",
    "this model is defined in eq .  .",
    "note that we consider applied field parallel to the axis of the ising spins on the @xmath2 sublattice , so that the @xmath2 spins remain classical in their behavior . in the presence of finite field @xmath13 , spins on the @xmath1-sublattice can still be integrated out , yielding an effective model in terms of the @xmath2 spins only , which reside on a kagome lattice .",
    "however , since the original model for @xmath87 has explicitly broken time - reversal symmetry , it is necessary to allow for the possibility of @xmath88-spin couplings in the effective model for the @xmath2 spins .",

    "the next most probable state has a hexagon of down - spins ( fig .",
    "[ x06 ] ) .",
    "this state has the same energy ( the ground state energy ) , and comes with a factor of @xmath122 because the hexagon can be placed anywhere in the lattice , but its statistical weight is smaller by a factor of @xmath123 , because there are 6 triangles that are @xmath105 instead of @xmath34 .",
    "continuing in this fashion ( fig .",
    "[ x10],[x12],[x12b ] ) , we obtain a series for the total number of states : @xmath124 ,      \\label{e : kagome - loop - degeneracy }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so the entropy per unit cell is @xmath125 when @xmath126 , including progressively more terms in the series gives the approximations @xmath127 ; @xmath128 ; @xmath129 ; and @xmath130 , suggesting that the entropy per unit cell is @xmath131 .",
    "the mean magnetization of the @xmath2-spins can be calculated by a similar series expansion : @xmath132 when @xmath126 this series gives @xmath133 .",
    "it seems likely that the true result is an irrational number .",
    "this is in contrast with the honeycomb dimer phase ( phase iv ) , which has rational magnetizations on both sublattices , @xmath134 .",
    "we now present an exact calculation of the entropy of phase xi .",
    "first , note that the kagome lattice is related to a honeycomb lattice in the following way .",
    "every triangle of the kagome lattice maps to a site of the honeycomb lattice , and every site ( spin ) of the kagome lattice maps to a bond on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "recall that in phase xi , every triangle on the kagome lattice contains either 0 or 2 down spins ( call these `` active sites '' ) .",
    "therefore , every allowed spin configuration on the kagome lattice corresponds to an `` active - bond '' configuration on the honeycomb lattice , in which every site of the corresponding honeycomb lattice must have either 0 or 2 active bonds adjacent to it .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ f : kagome - honey - mapping ] . )",
    "the higher - order terms in the series for the _ degeneracy _ of phase xi ( eq .  ) can be seen to be identical to the high - temperature series for the _ partition function _ of the ising model on the honeycomb lattice : @xmath135      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when @xmath136 and @xmath122 is the number of honeycomb unit cells .",
    "the _ entropy _ of the kagome loop phase is similarly related to the _ free energy _ of the honeycomb ising model .",
    "using the well - known exact integral expression for the latter@xcite , we find that the entropy of phase xi ( per unit cell ) is @xmath137 which agrees with the series result presented earlier .",
    "it is interesting that the kagome loop gas at @xmath52 and @xmath138 can be exactly mapped to a honeycomb ising model at @xmath139 and @xmath22 .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied an xxz - ising model on the triangular kagome lattice , in which spins residing on small triangles ( @xmath1-trimers ) are fully quantum mechanical , and spins residing on large triangles ( @xmath2-trimers ) are classical ising spins . for all fields and temperatures ,",
    "we have shown that there is an exact mapping to the kagome ising model .    in the absence of applied field , the full ising limit ( _ i.e. _ @xmath20 ) of the model has a phase transition from an ordered phase ( phase i ) for @xmath16 above a critical value @xmath140 , to a disordered phase with for @xmath141 which has residual entropy per unit cell @xmath142 ( phase v ) .",
    "the introduction of antiferromagnetic quantum fluctuations of the @xmath1-spins ( _ i.e. _ @xmath143 ) has little effect on the ordered phase , but it has dramatic effect on the disordered phase , partially lifting the degeneracy of the ground state and reducing the entropy by almost a factor of two to @xmath4 per unit cell . for strong ferromagnetic quantum fluctuations of the @xmath1-spins ( _ i.e. _ @xmath144 ) , a new phase ( phase @xmath145 ) appears in which the @xmath1-trimers have @xmath146 .",
    "there is a zero - temperature phase boundary on the xy side of the heisenberg line , for @xmath147 , separating this phase from the one with fully polarized @xmath1-trimers , phase @xmath148 , with @xmath146 within each @xmath1-trimer .",
    "all of the ground state phase transitions which occur in zero field survive at finite temperature , except for the ground state transition from an ordered phase with @xmath149 ( _ i.e. _ phase @xmath148 ) to an ordered phase with @xmath150 ( _ i.e. _ phase @xmath145 ) .",
    "since this transition is entirely about local physics , it becomes a crossover at finite temperature .",
    "however , its effects are quite evident at finite temperature , as the @xmath148 phase is more robust , and survives to much higher temperature than does the @xmath145 phase .    in the presence of applied field , we find that the xxz - ising model on the tkl maps to the kagome ising model in field with @xmath88-spin interactions .",
    "we find exact solutions for the ground state of this model . in the absence of quantum fluctuations , but for strongly frustrated interactions , we have previously shown that the ising tkl has a critical spin liquid ground state ( with power - law correlations ) for any weak applied field ( phase iv ) , which can be seen through a mapping to hard core dimer coverings of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "we find that this phase survives the addition of quantum fluctuations on the @xmath1-trimers ; however , it is then necessary to apply a finite magnetic field @xmath13 to access this phase ( rather than an infinitesimal field , as in the case of the tkl ising af ) . for antiferromagnetic interactions",
    ", we have shown that small ( and even infinitesimal ) applied fields lead to a `` kagome loop gas '' ground state ( phase xi ) .",
    "we have mapped this to the ferromagnetic honeycomb ising model at zero field and finite temperature , and hence we have shown that phase xi has an entropy of @xmath5 per unit cell .",
    "it is likely that the @xmath2-sublattice magnetization is irrational , in contrast to all the other phases studied in the paper .",
