    "star formation is one of the most important phenomena during the formation of a galaxy . to measure the star formation rate ( sfr ) , the luminosities of both h@xmath0  and @xmath1@xmath2 $ ]  are used because they depend on the ionizing photon luminosity .",
    "the radiation from massive stars , taken to be a blackbody @xcite and determined to arise from o / b stars , is the ionizing source to the  region   gas , or nebular gas .",
    "the sfr  have been quantified using large samples of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and across cosmic distances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on average ,",
    "star - forming galaxies are dusty ( e.g. , @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) ) .",
    "it is therefore critical to get sfr  free from extinction .",
    "the extinction correction to the spectral energy distribution of disk galaxies can be decomposed into two terms : the inclination - dependent and -independent ( e.g. , face - on ) corrections ( see * ? ? ?",
    "while the inclination dependency of optical stellar continuum in disk galaxies is established @xcite , that of individual nebular emissions is still lacking .",
    "the goal of this _ letter _   is to determine the inclination correction to individual nebular emissions and therefore sfr  of disk galaxies .",
    "we quantify the luminosity of the h@xmath0 , h@xmath4 , h@xmath5recombination lines , and the @xmath1@xmath2 $ ] , @xmath1@xmath2 $ ]   forbidden lines , as a function of inclination for a sample of local disk - dominated galaxies .",
    "the line - luminosity  inclination relation can be used to remove inclination - dependent extinction of disk galaxies .",
    "our sample is composed of galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) data release 6 ( dr6 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that are morphologically disk dominated and spectroscopically star forming .",
    "the selection criteria were described in detail in paper  i. to summarize the key characteristics , the sample is ( 1 ) within redshifts from 0.065 to 0.075 ; ( 2 ) within @xmath6-band petrosian absolute magnitudes from -19.5 to -22 ; ( 3 ) volume limited , in avoiding the malmquist bias and ( 4 ) showing a uniform distribution of inclination , in avoiding bias in galaxy properties from one inclination to the next . following paper  i , the inclination of a galaxy is proxied by its @xmath6-band axis ratio , with the consideration that the average ellipticity is small ( 16% , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to quantify the line luminosity as a function of inclination , we first construct high signal - to - noise composite spectrum , at a spectral resolution of 70  km  s@xmath7 , in bins of inclination ( table  [ tab : line ] ) .",
    "we then measure the continuum - subtracted line luminosities in the composites .",
    "the methodologies in continuum estimation and line fitting were discussed in paper  i. finally , we apply an aperture correction to obtain line luminosities that are expected from the whole galaxies . the correction is specifically developed in this work for the purpose of inclination studies with fiber spectroscopy .",
    "the sdss spectra of the galaxies are downloaded through the spectrum services @xcite .",
    "line luminosities are expressed in @xmath8 , and the vacuum wavelength convention is used throughout the analysis .",
    "the flux - to - luminosity conversion made use of the cosmological parameters @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic fiber is 1.5  in radius ( @xmath11  = 1.5 ) , which measures 0.5  half - light radius area on our disk galaxies ( see table  [ tab : size ] and  [ section : fiber - to - circle ] ) .",
    "a two - step procedure is developed to obtain line luminosities of the whole galaxies from the observed luminosities through the fiber .",
    "first , the fiber luminosity is converted to the central luminosity within a radius , @xmath12 , on the plane of a galaxy ( hereafter , the step _ fiber - to - circle _ ) .",
    "second , this central luminosity is converted to the luminosity of the whole galaxy ( the step _ circle - to - total _ ) .      when a disk galaxy is inclined , a circular spectroscopic fiber measures an elliptical area _ on the plane of the disk _ , rather than a circular area .",
    "the luminosity through the spectroscopic fiber is contributed not only from all of the isophotes within the radius @xmath12  = @xmath11  on the plane of the galaxy .",
    "light from isophotes that lie within an ellipse  which is the fiber aperture projected on the plane of the disk  also contribute .",
    "the minor and major axes of this ellipse are respectively @xmath11   and @xmath11@xmath13 .",
    "therefore , to obtain the central luminosity within @xmath12 , the luminosity outside of this circle , but within the ellipse , would needed to be subtracted from the fiber luminosity .",
    "this `` luminosity excess '' increases with inclination , and is zero for face - on galaxies .    to quantify this excess ,",
    "the radial distribution of in  situ h@xmath0luminosity is needed .",
    "we adopt the findings by @xcite , @xcite and .",
    "these authors found in the h@xmath0luminosity an exponential dependence with radius , separately in two disk galaxy samples .",
    "for the half - light radius of the h@xmath0profile , we adopt the ratio between the half - light radius of h@xmath0and that of the @xmath14-band in field spirals @xcite .",
    "the ratio involving the @xmath14  band is used because we can then use the half - light radius in the sdss @xmath15  band as a surrogate given their similar effective wavelengths , respectively 8062    and 8931   .",
    "the ratio is    @xmath16    and with a sample scatter of 0.52 .",
    "the bracket denotes the inclination , that is face - on in this case .",
    "similar to paper  i , we fit to apparent size vs. inclination the formula : @xmath17   =   { \\log}_{10 }   \\left [ { { r_{\\rm eff}}}(1 ) \\right ] - \\beta \\ , { \\log}_{10 } \\left ( { b / a}\\right ) \\label{eqn : reffvsinclination}$ ] .",
    "the results in table  [ tab : size ] show that the apparent size increases with inclination , found previously in other studies , and shown here for the 5 sdss bands @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath6 , @xmath20 , @xmath15 .",
    "the face - on half - light radius of the galaxies increases toward shorter wavelengths , consistent with the galaxies being dusty . as such",
    ", an extinction radial gradient causes an increase in the apparent half - light radius ; and the extinction amplitude is larger toward shorter wavelengths .",
    "the average @xmath15  band half - light radius of our galaxies , as required in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : reffhatoz ] , is 2.89  ( table  [ tab : size ] ) .    a numerical integration",
    "is then used to calculate the fiber - to - circle luminosity , @xmath21 , where the surface brightness of h@xmath0   follows an exponential profile ( see eqn .",
    "[ eqn : expprof ] below ) with the half - light radius derived above .",
    "the luminosity ratio is fully determined from the axis ratio of the galaxy , the h@xmath0  half - light radius , and the spectroscopic fiber radius @xmath11 .",
    "we find @xmath22 to be 2.7 , decreases gradually as inclination decreases , and is unity at the face - on orientation .",
    "the value of @xmath21 is tested to depend only mildly on the h@xmath0-to - continuum half - light radius ratio ,   change for   change in this ratio ( correspond to 1.33  @xmath23 sample scatter from @xcite ) .",
    "we calculate in this step the circle - to - total  h@xmath0 luminosity by considering the total luminosity inside a radius @xmath6 in a galaxy with exponential h@xmath0  profile :    @xmath24 } \\ , \\label{eqn : totalflux}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "the total luminosity , @xmath27 , is @xmath28 .",
    "the circle - to - total  luminosity , @xmath29 , can therefore be fully determined from the h@xmath0  half - light radius and the fiber radius only .",
    "the circle - to - total   h@xmath0   luminosity is determined to be , or @xmath30 .",
    "combining both corrections , the aperture - corrected line luminosity is finally    @xmath31",
    "the dependence of h@xmath0 , h@xmath4 , h@xmath5 , @xmath1@xmath2 $ ]   and @xmath1@xmath2$]luminosities on inclination are shown in figure  [ fig : lum_vs_inclination_alllines ] and tabulated in table  [ tab : line ] .",
    "their luminosities decrease with inclination .",
    "we deduce that this line - luminosity  inclination trend is caused by the presence of diffuse dust in the disk .",
    "the reasons are twofold .",
    "firstly , the geometry of the dust localized to the  regions  is not expected to correlate with the disk inclination . secondly , the relative extinction in the line luminosities is 1.2  mag , calculated from the factor of threeluminosity drop in the observed inclination range .",
    "this value is consistent with the extinction in disks @xcite , all being derived through the inclination dependency of stellar continuum .",
    "fitting the luminosities with a @xmath32 dependence    @xmath33 - \\log_{10}\\left[l(1)\\right ]   = - \\eta \\",
    ", \\log_{10}^{2}({b / a})\\label{eqn : luminosity - inclination - relation}\\ ] ]    gives @xmath34 in the @xmath35 range for these emission lines .",
    "the small range of @xmath34 values is a manifestation of these lines arisen from same  regions .",
    "the ratio of  region  emissions is , therefore , expected to remain constant with inclination ( e.g. , the constancy of balmer decrement in paper  i ) .",
    "we use the calibrations in to derive the present sfr   due to o / b stars from the line luminosities .",
    "the calibrations are    @xmath36    for h@xmath0  emission , and    @xmath37}}}{{7.14 \\times 10^{40}~\\mathrm{erg~s}^{-1 } } } \\,\\ , ( { m_{\\odot}~\\mathrm{yr}^{-1 } } ) \\label{eqn : sfroii}\\ ] ]    for @xmath1@xmath2 $ ]  emission .",
    "the derived h@xmath0   sfr  are shown on the right y - axis of figure  [ fig : lum_vs_inclination_6564.61.bayesian.gmean ] .",
    "the average sfr  for our disk galaxies is about 1.1  @xmath38 .",
    "the sfr  agree well in both the h@xmath0   and the @xmath1@xmath2 $ ]   lines , as shown in figure  [ fig : line_vs_line_sfr_6564.61_vs_sfr_3728.30.bayesian.gmean ] , in the inclination - to - inclination basis .",
    "this agreement is expected if the h@xmath0   and @xmath1@xmath2 $ ]  emissions arise from the same  regionsand hence the same inclination dependency . in principle",
    ", there could be regions embedded within the disks that can not be observed .",
    "the nebular luminosities , and hence the present sfr , are lower limits .    combining eqn .",
    "[ eqn : luminosity - inclination - relation ] with eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sfrha ] and [ eqn : sfroii ] ,",
    "the present sfrderived from h@xmath0  follow this relation    @xmath39 = \\log_{10}\\left[{\\mathrm{sfr}}({b / a})\\right ] + 0.89 \\ , \\log_{10}^{2}({b / a } ) \\ , \\ ] ]    and similarly for the @xmath1@xmath2$]-derived sfr ,    @xmath39 = \\log_{10}\\left[{\\mathrm{sfr}}({b / a})\\right ] + 0.91 \\ , \\log_{10}^{2}({b / a } ) \\ .\\ ] ]    as in line luminosities , the sfr  decreases by a factor of three from face - on to edge - on ( axis ratio limit being 0.17   in our sample ) galaxies .",
    "we note that , although the derivation of the sfr  inclination relations uses the correlation between line luminosity and sfr , the relations themselves do not depend on the actual values of the proportional constants in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : sfrha ] and [ eqn : sfroii ] .",
    "the @xmath1@xmath2$]/(h@xmath0   + @xmath1@xmath2 $ ] )   luminosity ratio ( table  [ tab : line ] ) is found here to be about 0.4(table  [ tab : line ] ) , in good agreement with that by ( * ? ? ? * in which the value is 0.4 ) , and about a factor of two   higher than the measurement by ( * ? ? ? * in which the value is 0.23 ) .",
    "we present the inclination dependency of the h@xmath0 , h@xmath4 , h@xmath5 , @xmath1@xmath2 $ ] , @xmath1@xmath2 $ ]   nebular luminosities derived from a sample of disk galaxies in the local universe .",
    "the extinction is deduced to be caused by diffuse dust in the disks with an amplitude of 1.2  mag .",
    "the line - luminosity  inclination relation can be used to correct for extinction in sfr  of inclined disk galaxies .",
    "the measuring of @xmath1@xmath2 $ ]   luminosity in sky surveys ",
    "boss @xcite , wigglez @xcite , primus @xcite , to name a few  would make our approach to become valuable in studying star - forming disk galaxies out to redshift of 1.6 .    for the continuum - generating stars , the model - based face - on ( i.e. , inclination independent ) extinction is in the optically thin regime ( e.g. , paper  i ) . that for the  region   emissions is not determined in this work",
