    "quantum imaging ( qi ) is an interesting technique which employs quantum properties of light , such as entanglement and nonlocality , to give a high resolution image from a partially - transmitting object @xcite .",
    "qi has also been experimentally demonstrated in numerous experiments @xcite , e.g. , through the method of  ghost imaging \" @xcite .    to recover information about an unknown ` object ' ( illuminated by either a  signal \" or an  idler \" photon ) , most qi methods employ entanglement of quantum states generated by parametric down - conversion .",
    "however , it has been shown that entanglement is not necessary for ghost imaging since using classically - correlated fields @xcite , thermal @xcite , and pseudo - thermal lights @xcite still enables obtaining images through ghost imaging .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that using half - wave plates properly ( considering polarization as a degree of freedom ) , one can affect output probabilities and thus visibility of the images @xcite .",
    "recently , a novel and elegant method for qi has been experimentally demonstrated in ref .",

    "@xcite for an extensive review .",
    "notwithstanding their differences , all qpt methods operate similarly based on probing an unknown process ( as a  black box \" ) with appropriate input states , measuring output states , and identifying the process through relation of input and output states .    establishing a connection between quantum tomography and _ imaging _ or _ sensing _ schemes can be interesting from various aspects .",
    "it has been argued that tomography and spectroscopy can be considered as dual forms of quantum computation @xcite . following a similar reasoning , one may also argue that qpt and qi of an object are basically akin in the sense that they both examine a(n ) process / object with probe states and then analyze output states .",
    "here we make this connection more explicit .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that the qi scheme proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite can be described as a version of aapt in which the object is assumed in both as a black box , whereas an identical or partial  image \" is obtained by analyzing ancillary probes .",
    "we elaborate in detail how this analogy work through identifying different steps of the qi scheme with preparation and measurement parts of a special aapt scenario .",
    "additionally , we represent a quantum circuit for the qi scheme , which helps analyze the role of initial - state correlations in qi .",

    "our discussion here concerns ( a simplified version of ) this experiment without realization technicalities , and aims at explaining how imaging an  object \" can be understood in the framework of qpt .    in this experimental setup",
    "a beam splitter ( bs1 ) , which is illuminated by a _ pump _",
    "photon , is used to generate the following path - entangled bell state : @xmath0 where @xmath1 indicates the wavelength of the pump photon , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote different paths which the photon can choose ( fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) . to set our notation hereafter",
    ", we assume that @xmath4 indicates an @xmath5-photon state with wavelength @xmath6 in path @xmath7 .",
    "since at any instant there exists at most one photon in each _ mode _ , we use the encoding @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which represent a logical basis as a  qubit \" @xcite .        [ setup ]    this setup includes two nonlinear crystals used to generate extra photons .",
    "these crystals should be pumped identically but not simultaneously .",
    "while passing through the nonlinear medium ( nl ) @xcite , a pump photon ( @xmath10 nm , in the original experiment ) can convert to a _ signal _ ( @xmath11 ) and an _ idler _ ( @xmath12 ) photon with different wavelengths ( @xmath13 nm and @xmath14 nm , respectively , in the original experiment ) through a down - conversion process .",
    "this is a probabilistic event .",
    "hence the probability of obtaining a photon in the final detectors of the setup are conditioned on a successful down - conversion process .",
    "however , in the following , we do not consider unsuccessful down - conversion events as they do not yield an image in this setup .",
    "nl1 changes the bell state ( [ bs1-action ] ) to @xmath15 the signal and idler photons are next separated ( because of their distinct wavelengths ) by a dichroic mirror ( d1 ) , which reflects the idler photons into path @xmath16 and allows photons with other wavelengths to pass .",
    "this yields @xmath17 the idler photon then illuminates the object located in path @xmath16 ; it either passes through the object ( @xmath18 ) with the associated transmission factor @xmath19 , or is reflected with the associated reflectivity factor @xmath20 .",
    "we note that for a real two - dimensional object both @xmath21 and @xmath22 depend on position on the object , that is , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 . in the real experimental setup of ref .",
    "@xcite , the object is placed between two lenses , and it has been argued that @xcite an incident plane wave mode with wave vector @xmath26 can illuminate one point of the object and hence yields an output wave with an associated wave vector @xmath27 .",
    "given that a quantized light is a superposition of plane wave modes , one can assume that one point on the object can transmit and reflect only one specific mode of the quantized ( idler ) beam @xcite .",
    "bearing in mind this one - to - one correspondence between the object and the image , it thus suffices  for our purposes here  to explain the basic theory of the imaging scenario through a single point of the object with constant @xmath21 and @xmath22 factors .",

    "there is a probability that after bs1 the photon goes through path @xmath3 and the whole state be affected by the dichroic mirror d2 .",
    "this mirror maps paths @xmath31 , thus the state of the system is transformed to @xmath32 now nl2 acts on this state as @xmath33 ; that is , it transforms a photon with the pump frequency to two photons along the same path @xmath34 .",
    "hence the total state becomes @xmath35 by using another dichroic mirror ( d3 ) , the idler photons are discarded from the setup .",
    "the pump photons are also discarded through d4 and d5 ; the reflected photon from the object is discarded too .",
    "mathematically , such discarding is represented by tracing out the idler photon , the pump photon , and the photon reflected to path @xmath30 .",
    "hence , the total state before bs2 becomes @xmath36 where to ease the notation we have removed the wavelength indices because after tracing out the idler and pump photons only signal photons remain .    .",
    "here @xmath37 is the hadamard gate and @xmath38 is the @xmath39-pauli gate . ]",
    "a pivotal feature of this setup is that after nl2 the source of the idler photons can not be distinguished , and this fundamental ambiguity in  which - path information \" is indeed responsible for creating the image . in other words , @xmath40 , which indicates that after nl2 the source as well as the path of the idler photons can not be discerned . at the final stage",

    "in such indirect schemes , although measurements are performed on systems that never directly met ( i.e. , passed through ) the black box , because of correlations between the system and ancilla(s ) , information of the black box would still leak to the ancillas such that one can identify the black box by measuring the ancilla(s ) . in the following",
    "we briefly describe this modified version of aapt .",
    "an arbitrary state of a bipartite system ( _ system _ + _ ancilla _ ) , with the hilbert space @xmath69 , ( as input of aapt ) can be written as ( schmidt decomposition ) @xmath70 where @xmath71s are some ( nonnegative ) numbers , and the @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) form an orthonormal operator basis on @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) , satisfying the orthonormalization condition @xmath76=\\delta_{\\ell \\ell'}$ ] ( @xmath77=\\delta_{\\ell \\ell'}$ ] ) , with @xmath78 being the dimension of the smallest hilbert space @xcite .",

    "thus in this particular case , we see that measurement on the ancilla would be adequate to reproduce the unknown process @xmath79 .",
