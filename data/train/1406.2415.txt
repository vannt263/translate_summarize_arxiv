    "@xcite were the first to point out that the postbounce dynamics and the progenitor - remnant connections are predictable basically by a single parameter , the compactness of the stellar core at bounce ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "along this line , @xcite performed 1d hydrodynamic simulations for 101 progenitors of @xcite . by replacing the proto - neutron star ( pns ) interior with an inner boundary condition",
    ", they followed an unprecedentedly long - term evolution over hours to days after bounce in 1d .",
    "their results also lent support to the finding by @xcite that the compactness parameter is a good measure to diagnose the progenitor - explosion and the progenitor - remnant correlation .",

    "the goal of our 2d models is not to determine the very final fate of a massive star ( which requires 3d - gr models with detailed transport scheme ) , but to study the systematic dependence of the progenitors structure on the shock revival time , diagnostic explosion energy , mass of remnant object , and nucleosynthetic yields . to this end",

    "the nuclear energy compensates for energy loss via endothermic decomposition of iron - like nse nuclei to lighter elements ( see appendix of @xcite for more details ) .",
    "to solve spectral transport of electron- ( @xmath24 ) and anti - electron neutrinos ( @xmath25 ) , we employ the isotropic diffusion source approximation ( idsa , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this approximation is useful because of the high computational efficiency in parallelization , which allows us to explore the more systematic progenitor survey based on the radiation - hydrodynamics models than ever in this study . regarding heavy - lepton neutrinos ( @xmath26 )",

    ", we estimate @xmath3 at @xmath37 ( @xmath40 ) directly from pre - collapse data .",
    "it should be noted that our definition of @xmath3 gives almost the same compactness estimated at bounce , because the radius @xmath41 enclosing @xmath39 is far from the center and the radial velocity @xmath42 there is very small ( e.g. , for s15.0 model @xmath43 cm and @xmath44 ) .",
    "actually @xmath45 of s15.0 model in our definition is 0.145 , which is very close to the value ( 0.150 ) estimated by @xcite at bounce .",
    "for all the employed 101 models , the bounce shock stalls in a spherically symmetric manner and only after that , we observe a clear diversity of the multi - d hydrodynamics evolution in the postbounce ( pb ) phase .",
    "figures [ fig - entall1 ] and [ fig - entall2 ] show a snapshot of entropy distribution for selected 18 models at @xmath7 ms . for some less massive progenitors ( e.g. , model s11.2 in figure [ fig - entall1](a ) ) , the shock is reaching close to the outer boundary of the computational domain with developing pronounced unipolar and dipolar shock deformations . at this time , the shock of the most massive progenitor ( s75.0 in figure [ fig - entall2](i ) ) is reaching an average radius of @xmath46 km , whereas the shock of s24.0 ( in figure [ fig - entall1]i ) still wobbles around at @xmath47 200 km .",
    "this demonstrates that the zams mass is not a good criterion to diagnose the possibility of explosion .",
    "this is more clearly visualized in the top left panel of figure [ fig - rsh - xi ] . taking six models as an example in the mass range between @xmath48 @xmath33 and @xmath49",
    ", the shock revival is shown to occur earlier for s20.0 ( red line ) and s22.0 ( blue line ) compared to the lighter progenitor s19.2 ( green line ) . comparing with the bottom left panel of figure [ fig - rsh - xi ]",
    ", it can be seen that the compactness parameter ( equation ( [ eq - xi ] ) ) is smaller for s20.0 ( labeled by red arrow ) and s22.0 ( by blue arrow ) in the chosen mass range above is rather weak , which is more clearly seen in figure [ fig - all](c ) . ] .",
    "the smaller compactness is translated into smaller mass accretion rate onto the stalled bounce shock . for model s20.0 ( red line in the top panel ) , the relatively earlier shock revival ( @xmath50 ms postbounce ) coincides with the sharp decline of the accretion rate ( dashed red line ) .",
    "after that , the accretion rate gradually decreases to @xmath51 till @xmath52 ms at this time the revived shock has expanded to an average radius of @xmath53 km . here",
    "@xmath54 is a useful measure to qualify the vigor of the shock revival ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand , high compactness ( model s21.0 , black arrow in the bottom panel ) leads to the high accretion rate ( black dashed line in the top panel ) and it takes @xmath2 500 ms for the sloshing shock ( black line in the top panel ) to gradually turn into a pronounced expansion later on ( @xmath54 = 700 ms )",
    ". the growing _ diagnostic _ explosion energy ( top right panel ) and the almost converged mass of pns ( bottom right ) are also shown as a function of post - bounce time .",
    "the pns mass has a clear correlation with @xmath45 .",
    "regarding the diagnostic energy , the increasing rate ( @xmath55 in unit of @xmath56 ) tends to become higher for models with high @xmath45 ( 0.754 , 1.12 , and 1.44 , for s22.0 , s23.0 and s24.0 , respectively ) .",
    "this also indicates that the diagnostic energy of the high-@xmath3 models might become higher later on .",
    "note that in previous 1d studies with simplified neutrino heating and cooling scheme @xcite or with the excision inside the pns @xcite , the relation between the compactness and these explosion properties could not be determined in a self - consistent manner .",
    "we investigate the postbounce shock evolution in more details for two specific models , s11.2 and s15.0 .",
    "the density profile of model s11.2 falls rapidly off with radius and the compactness parameter @xmath45=0.005 is one of the smallest values among the 101 progenitors , whereas model s15.0 has moderate compactness ( @xmath45=0.145 ) casting more extended envelope out to the iron core .",
    "color - coded panels in figure [ fig - pol ] show the differences in the postbounce evolution for s11.2 ( _ left _ ) and s15.0 ( _ right _ ) , respectively .",
    "model s11.2 explodes rather early ( @xmath54 = 150 ms , top panels ) and convective activity as well as the oscillations of the shock is moderate before the onset of the explosion ( see the bottom left panel ) .",
    "note in the bottom panels that the anisotropic velocity @xmath57 ( _ upper _ ) , and the normalized pressure perturbation @xmath58 ( _ lower _ ) , is defined respectively as @xmath59\\rangle /\\langle \\rho \\rangle } $ ] and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 represents the angle average of quantity @xmath62 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for model s15.0 with higher compactness parameter ,",
    "sloshing motions of the shock are more clearly visible ( right panels of figure [ fig - pol ] ) .",
    "these features regarding the dominance of the sasi over neutrino - driven convection for high-@xmath3 models are quantitatively consistent with those observed in @xcite .",
    "near at the bottom of the gain region , the accreting flows receive an abrupt deceleration , below which the regions are convectively stable . a strong pressure perturbation forms there ( seen , in the lower part of the bottom - right panel in figure [ fig - pol ] , as a boundary between the regions colored by white and deep blue at a radius of @xmath63 km after @xmath64 ms ) . subsequently the pressure perturbations propagate outward before they hit the shock , which is seen as a up - going stripe in the @xmath58 plot .",
    "this leads to the formation of the next vortices ( e.g. , yellow regions behind the shock in the @xmath57 plot ) .",
    "these features , as previously identified , are natural outcomes of the sasi and neutrino - driven convection ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "when the residency timescale becomes enough long , due to these multi - d effects , compared to the neutrino - heating timescale in the gain region , the runaway shock expansion initiates at @xmath65 500 ms ( @xmath66 ms ) for this model .",
    "such features have been also presented in previous 2d simulations with more detailed transport scheme ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we emphasize that the use of the leakage scheme , together with the omission of inelastic neutrino scattering on electrons and gr effects in the present scheme , is likely to facilitate artificially easier explosions ( see discussions in @xcite for more details ) .",
    "discrepancies between our newtonian models and gr models with detailed transport ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) become remarkable especially for progenitors with high compactness ( e.g. , compare model s27.0 in figure [ fig - entall2]b with the bottom right panel of figure 1 in @xcite ) . for models with moderate compactness parameter ,",
    "on the other hand , we like to note that some key hydrodynamic features in the postbounce phase ( such as the onset time of shock revival @xmath54 ) are rather similar ( surprisingly ) between ours versus the garching models ( @xmath54 = 640 vs. 580 ms for model s18.4 , 320 vs. 400 ms for s19.6 , 540 vs. 560 ms for s21.6 , 460 vs. 460 ms for s22.4 , 420 vs. 440 ms for s27.0 , respectively , e.g. , janka et al . ,",

    "[ fig - all ] , we plot various quantities to summarize our results for the 101 simulations as a function of @xmath45 . in the left panels , the mass accretion rate @xmath67 at 500 km , electron - type neutrino luminosity @xmath68 , and the shock revival time @xmath54 are shown .",
    "three panels in the right column show a _",
    "explosion energy @xmath69 , a mass of central remnants @xmath70 , and mass of nickel in the ejected material @xmath71 , at the final time @xmath72 of our simulations . here",
    "the pns is defined by the region where the density @xmath73 . for most of our models",
    "@xmath74 is defined as the time when the maximum shock radius arrived at the outer boundary .",
    "@xcite showed that these quantities are not a monotonic function of zams mass .",
    "we confirm it in our 2d simulations and find that these values are nearly in the linear correlation with the compactness parameter @xmath45 .",
    "this can be interpreted as follows : the core of high-@xmath3 models is surrounded by high - density si / o layers and the mass accretion rate therefore remains high long after the stalled shock has formed ( figures [ fig - all](a ) and 3 ) .",
    "this makes the pns mass of the high-@xmath3 models heavier ( figure [ fig - all](e ) ) . due to the high accretion rate ,",
    "the accretion neutrino luminosities become higher for models with high @xmath3 ( figure [ fig - all](b ) , see also @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", we obtain the high diagnostic explosion energy ( figure [ fig - all](d ) ) , as well as outgoing unbound material rich in nickel ( figure [ fig - all](f ) ) for high-@xmath3 models . on the other hand",
    ", the time of shock revival ( @xmath54 , figure [ fig - all](c ) ) shows a large scatter and weaker correlation with @xmath45 .",
    "this may come from the stochasticity of the initial random perturbations that should affect the onset of an explosion .",
    "it should be noted that the diagnostic energy of almost all models , which ranges in @xmath75 - @xmath76 erg , is still increasing at the final time of our simulation .",
    "we have conducted a systematic study of neutrino - driven ccsne in 2d to explore the difference that the structure of progenitors makes on the explosion characteristics , such as mass of central remnants .",
    "we find , as @xcite did in 1d , that these characteristics exhibit a non - monotonic variability as a function of the progenitor zams mass , which is a consequence of the non - monotonicities of the progenitor structure .",
    "thus , we adopted the compactness parameter @xmath3 introduced by @xcite to characterize the progenitor structure .",
    "we find that the accretion luminosity becomes higher for models with high @xmath3 , which makes the diagnostic energy higher and the synthesized nickel mass bigger .",
    "we point out that these explosion characteristics tend to show a monotonic increase as a function of the compactness parameter @xmath3 .",
    "our simulations are limited in space ( @xmath77 km ) and time ( @xmath78 s ) .",
    "the simulations are terminated before the diagnostic energies are saturated . later on neutrino energy deposition would get smaller with time as the neutrino luminosity as well as post - shock density becomes smaller . further global simulation , taking account of gravitational energy of an envelope and nuclear energy released via recombination process behind the shock , is necessary to determine the final explosion energy and the quantities shown in the right panels of figure [ fig - all ] . moreover , the finding of this study should be reexamined by 3d models @xcite , in which neutrino transport is appropriately solved ( see , e.g. , @xcite for different levels of sophistication ) . to get a more accurate amount of the synthesized nickel and other isotopes , a post - process calculation with a larger nuclear network is needed .",
    "after all , long - term 3d full - scale simulations are needed to unambiguously clarify the critical @xmath3 parameter , below or above which neutron stars or black holes will be left behind .    in this work",
    "we have reported our results of progenitors from one modeling group .",
    "currently we are conducting the same sort of ccsn simulations for sets of progenitors from the other groups including a variety of metallicity , rotation , and magnetic fields , which will be presented in the forthcoming work .",
    "we hope that the compilation of our results would be helpful to many researchers to study nucleosynthetic yields from ccsne and its impacts on chemical and dynamical evolution of galaxies , and also detectability of neutrino and gravitational - wave signals by next - generation detectors .",
