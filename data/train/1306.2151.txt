    "studies on the solar - cycle variations in the solar differential rotation and meridional flow are important for understanding the physical system that generates solar activity and the solar cycle  @xcite .",
    "the solar differential rotation is well studied , in addition to the use of the doppler - velocity measurements , using the data on different solar magnetic tracers ( mainly the sunspots and the sunspot groups ) .",
    "the results derived from the sunspot and the sunspot - group data show variations in both the equatorial - rotation rate and the latitude gradient of the rotation on several time scales , including time - scales close to the 11-year solar cycle @xcite .",
    "recently , detected variations on time - scales of a few days , including 9 and 3040 day quasi - periodicities , in the coefficients of differential rotation determined from the mount wilson doppler - velocity data during solar cycle  22 .",
    "the @xmath6 11-year period torsional oscillation detected by from the mount wilson doppler - velocity measurements is confirmed by the helioseismic studies  ( @xmath7 , ; )    studied the variations in the coefficients of the differential rotation determined from the sunspot group data ( 18791976 ) and the mount wilson doppler - velocity data ( 19621994 ) .",
    "they found considerable differences between the periodicities ( @xmath8 two years ) in the rotational coefficients derived from the doppler - velocity and the sunspot - group data .",
    "analyzed the data on the solar surface equatorial - rotation rate derived from the more accurate mount wilson doppler - velocity data during the period 19862007 and confirmed the short - term periodicities found by in the data before the year 1996 , but found no statistically significant variation after 1996 .",
    "that is , there is a very large difference between the temporal variations of the equatorial - rotation rate during solar cycle  22 ( @xmath9 before 1995 ) and cycle  23 .",
    "hence , it has been suspected that the frequent changes in the instrumentation of the mount wilson spectrograph might have made the data before 1995 erroneous and responsible for the variations in the equatorial - rotation rate derived from this data . to verify this , here",
    "we compare the variations in the equatorial- rotation rates derived from different rotational data and by using different techniques .",
    "the solar differential rotation can be determined from the full - disk doppler - velocity data using the traditional polynomial expansion @xmath10 and from sunspot data by using the first two terms of the expansion , @xmath9 @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the solar sidereal angular velocity at heliographic latitude @xmath13 , the coefficient @xmath14 represents the equatorial - rotation rate , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 measure the latitudinal gradient in the rotation rate with @xmath15 mainly representing low latitudes and @xmath16 mainly higher latitudes .    the sidereal rotation rate [ @xmath17 , in degrees day@xmath5 ] of a sunspot or sunspot group is computed as @xcite : @xmath19 or as ( @xmath7  ; ; ; ): @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are the differences between the heliographic longitudes [ l ] , the central meridian distances [ @xmath24 , and the observation times [ @xmath25 of two consecutive days observations of the sunspot or sunspot group , respectively , and the values @xmath26 day@xmath5 and 0.9856 are the carrington rigid - body rotation rate and the correction factor corresponding to the earth s rotation , respectively . the quantity @xmath27 represents the synodic rotation rate . within the uncertainties ,",
    "both these methods yield the same result ( the latter gives a relatively small value for the rotation rate ; see ) .",
    "javaraiah and co - authors have used equation  ( 3 ) in all of their earlier articles ( @xmath7  , @xcite , @xcite ; ; , @xcite ; , @xcite ; ) .",
    "( details on the method of conversion of the synodic to sidereal rotation rate can be found in some of the above cited articles , @xmath7 and references therein . )",
    "the solar differential rotation can also be studied by binning the data into latitude intervals of reasonably small size , @xmath9 without using the above equations ( see the references above ) .",
    "this subject is reviewed by a number of authors ( @xmath7 and references therein ) .      here the greenwich sunspot - group data during period may/1874december/1976 and the soon sunspot - group data during 19772010 are used .",
    "these data are taken from the website http://solarcience.msfc.nasa.gov/greenwich.shtml , and consist of @xmath28 , @xmath13 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , _ etc . _ , for each sunspot group on each day of its observation . by using equation  ( 3 )",

    "each year s data are fitted to equation  ( 2 ) .",
    "the latitudinal dependencies in the mean rotation rate of the sunspot groups over the whole period 19772011 ( whole soon data set ) is determined by averaging the daily values of the rotational velocities in two - degree ( and @xmath31 ) latitude intervals and also by fitting the whole period daily data to equation  ( 2 ) . the data in both the northern and the southern hemispheres have been combined .",
    "these calculations are also done by using the greenwich data during the period may 1874december 1976 .",
    "since the rotation rates of tracers depend on the lifetimes / sizes / age of the tracers , the latitudinal dependence in the initial rotation rates ( the first two days heliographic positions of the sunspot groups are used ) of the sunspot groups is also studied by classifying the sunspot groups on the basis of their lifetimes : one  three days , four  five days , six  eight days , and @xmath8 eight days . for this the combined greenwich and soon data are used .    the sunspot - group data that correspond to @xmath32 in any day of the sunspot group lifetime are not used . in the case of the study of the initial rotation rates of the sunspot groups , in order to avoid ambiguity in the identifications of the first two days in the lifetimes of the sunspot groups , the data during the entire lifetime of a sunspot group are eliminated even in any one day @xmath32 . since the cutoff of @xmath33 is applied to both the eastern and the western sides , the sunspot groups that emerged at the visible side of the sun and after certain number of days went to the other side were not taken into account in the data sample of any of the aforementioned classes ( note : each disk passage of a recurrent sunspot group is treated as an independent sunspot group ) . as in our previous articles , the data correspond to @xmath34 day@xmath5 latitudinal motions and @xmath35 day@xmath5 longitudinal motions ( _ i.e .",

    "the time series has data gaps that vary in size , with a maximum gap of 49 days during carrington - rotation numbers 15601608 .",

    "the faster rotation rates of sunspots , compared to the photospheric plasma , have been explained in several ways : i ) the emergent motion of the magnetic flux loop driven by buoyancy  ( @xmath7  ; ; ) , ii ) geometrical projection effects  @xcite , iii ) the drag due to ambient flows  @xcite , and iv ) the interaction between magnetic buoyancy , drag , and coriolis forces acting on the rising flux tubes  @xcite .",
    "however , in spite of the aforementioned effects , the similarity between the variation in the initial rotation rates of the sunspot groups with their lifetimes and the radial variation of the internal rotation rate determined from helioseismology suggests that the magnetic structures of sunspot groups with successively longer life times ( 212 days ) are initially anchored in successively deeper layers of the sun s convection zone  @xcite .",

    "the magnetic structures of the sunspot groups whose lifetimes exceed eight days seem to initially anchor in the layers below 0.8r@xmath0 , and those of the sunspot groups with life times up to 8 days seem to initially anchor in the layers above 0.8r@xmath0 , as suggested by the pattern of the variation in the initial rotation rates of the sunspot groups with their lifetimes ( see ) . in figure  5",

    "these results are largely consistent with the results / suggestions in  .",
    "( the profile of the very short - lived sunspot groups is even above the rotation profile at 0.94r@xmath0 .",
    "the angular motions of super - granules may influence the rotation rates of the very short - lived sunspot groups . in this regard",
    "it may be worth noting that the magnetohydrodynamic drag force may be large on the small magnetic structures  ( ) .",
    "the results ( the profiles of the mean rotation rates of sunspot groups ) shown in figures  2 and 3 are determined from the combined data of all of the sunspot groups during all of the days in their respective lifetimes .",
    "these results and also the results ( the mean profiles of the initial rotation rates of sunspot groups ) shown in figures 5(a  c ) are similar to the results found in most of the other such studies in which the sunspot groups were not sorted out according to their lifetimes  (; ) . found that the initial velocity of recurrent sunspot groups is larger than the non - recurrent sunspot groups and suggested that the recurrent sunspot groups initially anchor at 0.93r@xmath0 .",
    "the range of the internal rotation rate that corresponds to the increase in depth from 0.94r@xmath00.75r@xmath0 is approximately the same as that corresponding to the decrease in the depth from 0.94r@xmath01.0r@xmath0 . in view of the result that the magnetic structures of the sunspot groups with successive longer life times ( 212 days ) are initially anchored in successively deeper layers throughout the sun s convection zone  @xcite , in figure  5 the internal rotation rates",
    "are shown for a wide range of depths . in figures  2 and 3",
    "the mean rotation rates of the sunspot groups are compared with the internal rotation rates at a narrow and relatively shallower region , because the average rotation profile of sunspot groups is mostly contributed from the rotation rates of long - lived ( lifetime @xmath8 eight days ) sunspot groups during the last few days of their lifetimes  ( ) . the rotation rates of the long - lived / large sunspot groups are considerably lower during their initial and final days of their lifetimes .",
    "the derived mean rotation rate of sunspot groups somewhat depends on the cutoff of @xmath30 .",
    "it decreases when larger @xmath30 values are allowed ( and references therein ) . in all their studies javaraiah and co - authors allowed @xmath66 .",
    "ward ( @xcite , @xcite ) allowed @xmath67 up to @xmath68 , whereas many others allowed it up to @xmath69 only .",
    "a larger cutoff of @xmath30 relatively reduces the contributions of long - lived sunspot groups , particularly contributions from during their initial and final days , for the derived mean rotation rate .",
    "hence , the derived value of the mean rotation rate of sunspot groups is relatively large .",
    "however , it is necessary to make sure that the first days data sample should not contaminated with the sunspot groups arriving from other side of the sun .",
    "thus , the calculations of the results shown in figure  5 are repeated by restricting @xmath30 up to @xmath70 only , and the results are shown in figures  6 and 7 .",
    "these results are largely same as those shown in figure  5 .",
    "hence , the conclusions / inferences drawn above from results shown in figure  5 are largely hold good for the results shown in figures  6 and 7 also .",
    "it is widely believed that magnetic flux , in the form of large flux tubes , emerges to the surface presumably from near the base of the convection zone ( where the dynamo process is believed to be taking place ) and responsible for sunspots and other solar active phenomena ( see ; ) .",
    "there are also suggestions / arguments that the sunspots form just beneath the surface  (; ) and in different layers throughout the convection zone  ( ) .",
    "the results above are largely consistent with these suggestions / arguments , but the same results also support the idea that large magnetic structures might be generated near the base of the solar convection zone ; many of the large magnetic structures may be fragmenting or branching into smaller structures while buoyant rising through the solar convection zone , @xmath9 small magnetic structures may be fragmented or branched parts of the large magnetic structures ( ) . argued that the dynamical disconnection of sunspots from their magnetic roots should take place during the final phases of their magnetic structures buoyant ascent towards the surface .      figure  8 shows the variations in the annual mean values of the equatorial - rotation rate determined from the doppler - velocity data and the sunspot - group data that did not include the abnormal values of @xmath17 . in this figure",
    "we also show the variations of the equatorial - rotation rates at 0.96r@xmath0 and 1.0 r@xmath0 determined from gong data for each of 147 intervals of three gong - months during 19952009 , the variation in the equatorial - rotation rate of the soft x - ray corona determined from the _",

    "since the mean value ( @xmath71 day@xmath5 ) of the equatorial - rotation rate determined from the sunspot - group data during the period 19852010 is close to the mean @xmath38 at 0.96r@xmath0 ( @xmath42 figures  2 and 3 ) , the variation in the former is compared with that of the latter , besides comparing it with the variation at 1.0r@xmath0 ( due to the scaling problem the variation in @xmath38 at 1.0r@xmath0 is shown in figure  8(a ) instead of in figure  8(b ) ) . however , as can be seen in figure  1 , the patterns of the variations of the equatorial rotation rates at different depths are largely similar .    as can be seen in figure  8 , the mean value of the equatorial - rotation rate determined from the sunspot - group data is substantially higher ( although it is lower during cycle  22 than in the last 11 solar cycles  (; ) ) and the amplitude of its variation is also about ten times higher than that determined from the doppler - velocity measurements .",
    "the variation in the equatorial - rotation rate determined from the sunspot - group data steeply decreased during the rising phase of the solar cycle  22 .",
    "it attained minimum at the maximum of this cycle and remained approximately the same level up to the end of the cycle , and then it steeply increased in the beginning of cycle  23 .",
    "the overall pattern suggests that there exists a quasi-11-year cycle in the equatorial - rotation rate ( correlation coefficient @xmath72 , between sunspot number and @xmath14 ) . at the beginning of cycle  24",
    "the equatorial - rotation rate is considerably higher than that during the last about twenty years ( including the beginnings of cycles  22 and 23 ) .",
    "the pattern of the variation in the equatorial - rotation rate is consistent with the well known result of a higher rotation rate during the cycle minimum than during the maximum , found in many studies ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that the minimum years of the solar cycles contain mainly small sunspot groups  @xcite .",
    "small sunspot groups rotate faster than large sunspot groups ( @xmath7 ; , also see section  3.1 above ) .",
    "this property of the sunspot groups most probably has an influence on the aforementioned pattern of the solar cycle variation in the surface equatorial - rotation rate determined from the sunspot - group data .",
    "the increases of rotational velocities in 20012002 and 20082009 are most pronounced in gong results at 1.0r@xmath0 .",
    "similar increases also exist in the result obtained by using sunspot - group data ( see figure  8(a ) ) .",
    "in fact , there is a reasonable agreement between the pattern of the variations in the equatorial - rotation rates determined from the sunspot - group data and the gong data ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "however , there is a considerable difference in the positions of the minima of these variations , giving an impression of the internal equatorial - rotation rate leads the equatorial - rotation rate of the sunspot groups by one to two years ( the reason for this is not known to us ) .",
    "the annual variation in the equatorial - rotation rate determined from the doppler - velocity data also steeply decreased during the rising phase and attained minimum at the sunspot maximum of the solar cycle  22 , but it increased sharply from 1990 to 1993 and suddenly dropped from 1993 to 1994 . overall the equatorial - rotation ration rate is low during cycle  23 , but there is an indication of the variation in the equatorial - rotation rate is in phase with number of sunspots in the interval 19982004 ( however , the value of @xmath14 suddenly increased around 2005 and than decreased ) .",
    "this behavior is opposite to that in the previous cycle .",

    ". in each of these cases the error - bars represent the values of 1@xmath37 obtained from the linear least - square fits of the data ( in the case of sbcs @xmath37 has very low values ) .",
    "the dotted and three dotted - dashed curves are the variations in the equatorial ration rates at @xmath73 and @xmath74 , determined from gong data for each of 147 intervals of three gong - months during 19952009 ( antia and basu , 2010 ) .",
    "the solid horizontal line is drawn at the mean values of @xmath75 day@xmath5 , determined from the yearly values of the sunspot - group data .",
    "( b ) the solid curve represents the variation in the annual mean @xmath14 determined from the corrected mount wilson doppler - velocity data ( javaraiah @xmath76 2009 ) .",
    "the error bars represent one standard error ( @xmath37 has very high values ) .",
    "the dashed curve represents the variation in the annual mean international sunspot number ( ssn ) , which is normalized to the scale of @xmath14 .",
    "the solid horizontal line is drawn at the mean value of @xmath14 , @xmath77 day@xmath5 , determined from the yearly values .",
    "note : in the case of mount wilson doppler - velocity data in 2007 the data are available only up to march . ]    in figure  9 the variations in the equatorial - rotation rate determined from the doppler - velocity data and the sunspot - group data that included the abnormal values of @xmath17 ( @xmath9 , @xmath78 day@xmath5 ) calculated by using equation  ( 3 ) are compared . as already mentioned above , the inclusion of the abnormal values of @xmath17 increases the uncertainties of the derived coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 , in spite of the size of the data increasing by 4 % 5 % ( the highest is 8.4 % around 2009 ) .",
    "hence , with the inclusion of abnormal @xmath17 values the errors [ @xmath37 ] of individual yearly averages are so large that they are not significantly ( statistically ) different from each other so that the variations can not be examined using them .",
    "therefore , the values of @xmath14 determined by binning the data into three - year moving time intervals ( mtis ) are used . in this figure",
    "the variation in @xmath14 determined from the data that does not include the abnormal values and binned into three - year mtis is also shown , in order to get an idea about how much difference exists between the yearly ( @xmath80 figure  8(a ) ) and three - year mtis data . in the case of the equatorial - rotation rate determined from the doppler - velocity data , the three - year smoothed time series obtained from the annual values ( @xmath80 figure  8(b ) ) is shown . as can be seen in figure  9 , the patterns of the variations in the equatorial - rotation rates derived from the sunspot - group data and the doppler - velocity data closely resemble one another ( correlation coefficient @xmath6 0.5 ) .",
    "in fact , during cycle  23 the shapes of the curves are almost the same ( the doppler - velocity measurements are relatively more accurate after 1995 ) .",
    "this result indicates that the temporal variation in the equatorial - rotation rate determined from the doppler - velocity measurements is of solar origin , which has been doubtful so far for the reason mentioned in section  1 .",
    "however , this result / conclusion is only suggestive rather than compelling , because the uncertainties in @xmath14 determined from the sunspot - group data that included the abnormal angular motions of the sunspot groups are large ( in the figure the error bar represent one standard error level ; the corresponding @xmath37 is very high ) .",
    "in addition , the abnormal angular motions of the sunspot groups may not represent the angular motions of the surface plasma .",
    "these motions may be the abnormal proper motions of the sunspot groups , which took place at the locations of the eruptive solar phenomena such as flares .",
    "the doppler - velocity measurements may be also contaminated with the contributions from such motions of plasma ( note : the spikes in the daily mt .",
    "wilson velocity data are already removed .",
    "further trimming will create more data gaps and make the data more unrealistic ) .",
    "derived from the sunspot group ( ssg ) data  that included with and without abnormal @xmath17 values ( @xmath35 day@xmath5 ) , respectively  in three - year mtis successively shifted by one year . in the former case",
    "the error - bars represent the standard error ( because of high @xmath37 value ) and in the letter case they represent the values of 1@xmath37 .",
    "the solid and long - dashed horizontal lines are drawn at the corresponding mean values of @xmath14 , @xmath81 day@xmath5 and @xmath82 day@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "( b ) the filled circle - solid curve represents the 3-year smoothed @xmath14 derived from the annual mean values of @xmath14 ( shown in figure  8(b ) ) determined from the mount wilson doppler - velocity data ( error bars represent one standard error ) .",
    "the solid horizontal line is drawn at the corresponding mean value of @xmath14 , @xmath83 day@xmath5 .",
    "the dashed curve represents the variation in the annual mean international sunspot number ( ssn ) , which is normalized to the scale of @xmath14 .",
    "note : in the case of mount wilson doppler - velocity data in 2007 the data are available only up to march . ]    on the other hand , the mean values @xmath84 and @xmath85 day@xmath5 ( see figures  2 and 3 ) of the equatorial - rotation rates determined from the soon and greenwich daily sunspot - group data , respectively , which included the abnormal @xmath17 values are significantly ( more than 2@xmath37 level ) lower than the corresponding values @xmath86 and @xmath87 determined from the data that did not include the abnormal values .",
    "overall it seems that mean values determined from the soon data that included the abnormal @xmath17 values is somewhat closer to the mean value ( @xmath77 day@xmath5 ) of the equatorial - rotation rate determined from the doppler - velocity data . in figure  10",
    "( the histogram of the distribution of the abnormal angular velocity values ) there is a suggestion that the peaks of the open circle - dashed curve in figure  9 included the majority of the abnormal velocity values ( in the range @xmath88 ) that are somewhat consistent with the rotation rate of the sun .",
    "therefore , the similarity in the variations of the doppler - velocity data and the sunspot - group data that included the abnormal motions suggest that the former may be largely of solar origin rather than spurious . nevertheless , the highly unrealistic latitudinal gradient of the rotation ( see figures  2 and 3 ) that is obtained from the sunspot - group data that included the abnormal @xmath17 values may have a large influence on the corresponding equatorial - rotation rate , making the latter unreliable .",
    "for this reason , and because of the large range and the large uncertainties in annual mean values ( including all errors of measurements both random and systematic ) , the reality / reliability of variation in the sunspot - group data that included the abnormal motions is doubtful .",
    "hence , the similarity in the solar - cycle variations in the doppler - velocity data and the sunspot - group data that included the abnormal motions may rather suggest that variation in the doppler - velocity data ( before 1995 ) could be contributed by the large uncertainties in this data .        as can be seen in figure  8 , the equatorial - rotation rate determined from the yohkoh / sxt full - disk images for the period 19922001 by   is closely matches that determined from the sunspot group data for all of the years except for the year 2000 , where it has a large value .",
    "close to this year there are humps in the variation of @xmath14 determined from the sunspot group and the doppler - velocity data also , although they are small .",
    "thus , the coronal rotation is strongly related to the angular motions of the surface magnetic features .",
    "( there seems to be a better agreement between the phases of @xmath38 and @xmath14 of the corona , particularly the agreement is large in minima . )",
    "however , the pattern of @xmath14 determined from the sbcs seems to be considerably different from those of other data sets , particularly in the period 20012003 .",
    "in fact , it seems anticorrelated with that of the gong data .",
    "the reason for this is not known .",
    "( it should be noted that the aforementioned similarity between the variation in the equatorial - rotation rate of sunspot groups / corona and the variation in the internal equatorial - rotation rate is only in shape .",
    "the amplitude of the variation in the internal equatorial - rotation rate is relatively very small . )",
    "the following conclusions can be drawn from our analysis :    * \\i ) a large portion ( up to @xmath1 latitude ) of the mean differential - rotation profile of the sunspot groups lies between those of the internal differential - rotation rates at @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the portions up to @xmath65 latitude in the mean profiles of the initial rotation rates of the up to eight days and longer than eight days living sunspot groups are close to the those of the internal rotation near 0.96r@xmath0 and 0.8r@xmath0 , respectively . * \\ii ) at the end of cycle  23 and the beginning of cycle  24 the value of the equatorial - rotation rate determined from the sunspot - group data is considerably higher than that of at the beginning of cycle  23 , overall the pattern of variation in the equatorial - rotation rate during cycles  22 and 23 resembles the pattern of the known solar - cycle variation in the equatorial - rotation rate determined from sunspot data . *",
    "\\iii ) there is a reasonable agreement between the pattern of the variation in the equatorial - rotation rate determined from the sunspot - group data and that determined from the gong data [ @xmath38 ] .",
    "there is also an impression that the variation in the internal equatorial - rotation rate leads the equatorial - rotation rate of sunspot groups by one to two years ( the reason for this is not known to us ) . *",
    "\\iv ) the pattern of the known solar - cycle variation in the equatorial - rotation rate of the solar corona determined from the _",
    "yohkoh_/sxt full - disk images and sbcs closely matches with that determined from the sunspot - group data ( except during the period 20012003 ) .",
    "this indicates that the coronal rotation is strongly related to the rotational motion of the surface magnetic features . *",
    "\\v ) the variation in the equatorial - rotation rate determined from the mount wilson doppler - velocity data substantially differs from the corresponding variation in the equatorial - rotation rate determined from the sunspot group data that did not include the values of the abnormal angular motions ( @xmath4 day@xmath5 ) of the sunspot groups , whereas it closely resembles the corresponding variation determined from the sunspot - group data that included the values of the abnormal angular motions . *",
    "\\vi ) conclusions  v ) above may suggest that the solar - cycle variation in the surface equatorial - rotation rate determined from the doppler - velocity measurements ( before 1995 ) is caused by the inconsistency and uncertainties in the data ( but it needs further studies to find a definite answer ) .",
