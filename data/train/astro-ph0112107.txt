    "it is of great importance to identify strange stars ; a new window of distinguishing neutron stars and bare strange stars ( bsss ) has been proposed recently according to their sharp differences of surface conditions ( xu , zhang , qiao 2001 ; usov 2001a ) .",
    "it is therefore essential to study the surface properties of bsss in details , e.g. , the degree of the thermal luminosity of a hot bss",
    ".    the surface electric field should be very strong ( @xmath0 v / cm ) near the bare quark surface of a strange star because of the mass difference of the strange quark and the up ( or down ) quark ( alcock et al . 1986 ) , which could play an important role in producing the thermal emission of bsss by the usov mechanism ( usov 1998 , usov 2001b ) , because the strange quark matter is a poor radiator of thermal photons at frequencies less than its plasma frequency ( @xmath1 mev ) ( alcock et al .",
    "the basic idea of the usov mechanism is that @xmath2 pairs are created rapidly in a few empty quantum states with energy @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the fermi energy , @xmath5 the electron mass ) due to the very strong electric field in an electron layer ( with a height of @xmath6 fm above quark surface ) ; the pairs subsequently annihilate into photons which are then thermalized in the electron layer k. ] around a bss .",
    "this radiative mechanism has been applied tentatively to soft @xmath7 ray repeaters ( usov 2001c ; usov 2001d ) recently .",
    "in addition , the strong electric field plays an essential role in forming a possible crust around a strange star , which has been investigated extensively by many authors ( e.g. , martemyanov 1992 ; kettner et al .",
    "1995 ; huang & lu 1997 ; phukon 2000 ; see zdunik , haensel & gourgoulhon 2001 for the recent development with the inclusion of rotating and general - relativistic effects ) .",
    "also it should be noted that this electric field has some important implications on pulsar radio emission mechanisms ( xu & qiao 1998 ; xu , qiao , zhang 1999 ; xu , zhang , qiao 2001 ) .",
    "in fact the usov mechanism of pair production depends on many parameters ; it is therefore imperative to study the dependence of the process on these parameters . with some typical parameters chosen by usov in his calculations , the resultant thickness of the electron layer with electric field @xmath8 v / cm ( the critical field necessary for pair production ) , @xmath9 , is @xmath6 fm .",
    "however the proper determination of the thickness @xmath9 should be done with the dynamical theory of the strange quark matter . because of the untractable nature of the quantum chromodynamics , some phenomenological models , i.e. , the mit bag model ( e.g. , jensen & madsen 1996 ) , the quark mass - density - dependent model ( e.g. , lugones & benvenuto 1995 ) , and the quark potential model ( e.g. , dey et al .",
    "1998 ) , have been applied to the descriptions of the strange quark matter . in the bag model",
    ", @xmath9 is a function of @xmath10 ( the coupling constant for strong interactions ) , @xmath11 ( the strange quark mass ) , and @xmath12 ( the bag constant ) .",
    "also it should be noticed that the quark number densities , @xmath13 ( i = u , d , s for up , down and strange quarks , respectively ) , are assumed to be uniform below the quark surface , and therefore the quark charge density @xmath14 is constant near the surface .",
    "the potential @xmath15 is usually chosen as 20 mev for typical cases .",
    "however the quark number densities should not be uniform near the surface if boundary effects are included , since charge neutrality is broken there .    in this paper",
    "we improve the calculation of the electric field in the vicinity of a bss surface , using the popular bag model and the thomas - fermi model .",
    "we investigate the electric characteristics of bsss for different values of @xmath16 .",
    "initially we use typical parameters for @xmath17 mev and @xmath18 mev .",
    "then the thickness , @xmath9 , of the electron layer where pairs can be created , is computed as functions of @xmath12 , @xmath11 , and @xmath16 .",
    "it is found that usov s estimates are representative for bag - model parameters within a rather wide range .",
    "boundary effect are also considered in this calculation .",
    "the interesting electric properties of strange stars were first noted by alcock , farhi & olinto ( 1986 ) , who presented numerical calculations of the electric potentials of strange stars with or without crusts .",
    "analytical solutions of the electron number density and the electric field was also formulated , which could be helpful in dealing with some physical processes near the quark surfaces of strange stars ( xu & qiao 1999 ) . in this section ,",
    "the bag model is applied to calculate the quark charge density ; the thomas - fermi model is employed to find @xmath9 dependence on @xmath16 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , with the inclusion of boundary effects .      in our calculation , the quarks and electrons near the surface of the strange star keep chemical equilibrium locally ; the relation between charge density and electric potential is described by the classical poisson equation .",
    "the thermodynamic potentials @xmath19 as functions of chemical potentials @xmath20 ( i = u , d , s , e ) , @xmath11 and @xmath16 can be found in literature ( alcock et al . 1986 ) . in the chemical equilibrium of weak interaction , @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a measured height above the quark surface .",
    "the quark number densities drop to zero on the surface , but they are not uniform below the surface if the boundary effects are considered .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath26 can be determined by the condition that the pressure on the quark surface is zero , @xmath27 .",
    "the pressure is @xmath28 ( alcock et al .",
    "1986 ) .      the boundary conditions for eq.([a6 ] )",
    "are @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the electric potential in the deep core of the strange star , which is determined from eq.([a6 ] ) by letting the left hand side equal zero .      by integrating eq.([a6 ] ) in",
    "@xmath41 $ ] and @xmath42 respectively , with the boundary conditions , we get the expression of the electric field @xmath43 , where @xmath44 .",
    "obviously @xmath45 is a function of @xmath16 , which can be obtained from the continuity of @xmath46 at @xmath47 . substituting @xmath45 into the equations of @xmath46 and then integrating them",
    ", we get the expression of @xmath32 . for @xmath48 , we find @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51    several numerical results are obtained , which are shown in table 1 and figs.1 - 4 .",
    "first , we study the electric characteristics of a bss for different values of @xmath16 , assuming and @xmath12 , @xmath52 . in this assumption @xmath53 mev . ]",
    "@xmath54 mev , @xmath17 mev , and the renormalization point @xmath55 mev .",
    "the quark and electron number densities \\{@xmath13 } when @xmath56 , as well as potentials of @xmath40 and @xmath57 , are listed in table 1 for @xmath58 , respectively .",
    ".the particle number densities far below the quark surface , and the potentials of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , for different values of @xmath16 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the electric potential @xmath32 and field @xmath46 are also plotted in figs.1 - 3 for this case .",
    "we see from fig.1 that the potential curve becomes flatter when the coupling constant @xmath16 increases .",
    "also it should be noted from figs.2 and 3 that the electric filed @xmath46 changes rather slowly for @xmath61 , but varies rapidly for @xmath62 .",
    "this indicates the non - symmetric nature of the electric field with respect to the quark surface of @xmath47 .",
    "secondly , we investigate numerically the thickness , @xmath63 , of the electron layer where pairs can be created , as functions of the bag parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath10 . the results are shown in fig.4 .",
    "it is found that the usov mechanism can work for bag parameters within a rather wide range .",
    "the thickness @xmath9 could be large enough ( i.e. , @xmath64 fm ) as long as ( 1 ) @xmath12 is not too large and @xmath11 is not too small , or ( 2 ) @xmath12 is not too small and @xmath11 is not too large .",
    "increasing of @xmath65 has an adverse influence on the usov mechanism .",
    "for instance in fig.2 , the field @xmath46 can not exceed the critical field @xmath66 v / cm ( necessary for pair production ) if @xmath67 .",
    "nevertheless previous dynamical calculations show that @xmath68 is less possible for a stable strange quark matter .",
    "in conclusion we could expect that the pair emission process proposed by usov might appear in nature for acceptable bag parameters .",
    "we have improved the calculation of the electric characteristics of bare strange stars with the inclusion of boundary effects ( i.e. , the effects of non - local neutrality near and below the quark surface ) . from our calculation , we find that the usov mechanism can work for bag parameters within a rather wide range .    as shown in table 1 , both @xmath45 and @xmath40 , as well as their very small difference , decrease as @xmath16 increases . our results on the electric potential @xmath69 for @xmath62",
    "is quit different from the previous calculation given by alcock et al.(1986 ) where the boundary effects were not included ( see fig .",
    "it is shown that the strong electric field resides only about @xmath70 fm below the quark surface ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , rather than @xmath71 fm obtained by alcock et al . ( 1986 ) .    we can proof that @xmath46 is almost an exponential function of @xmath25 below the quark surface .",
    "denote the right hand side of the eq.([a6 ] ) as @xmath72 . as @xmath73 , namely @xmath74",
    ", we have @xmath75 . approximating @xmath72 as @xmath76",
    ", we can obtain @xmath77z$ ] and @xmath78 $ ] for @xmath79 .    _ acknowledgments .",
