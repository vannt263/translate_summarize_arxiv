    "mbm 12 ( magnani , blitz , & mundy 1985 ) is the closest known molecular cloud .",
    "its distance has been estimated to be @xmath2 pc ( hobbs , blitz , & magnani 1986 ) .",
    "this means that the distance to mbm 12 is less than half of that to the closest star - formation complexes ( e.g. , 140 pc to taurus ) .",
    "therefore , determining the presence of star - forming processes in mbm 12 would allow us to get deep into the smallest possible physical scales of these processes .",
    "for instance , for young low - mass stars a critical scale is @xmath3 au , which is the estimated size of protoplanetary discs , and the distance at which jets are being collimated @xcite .",
    "a size of 100 au at 65 pc will extend @xmath4 , which is a resolution attainable at present , for instance by millimetre interferometers already operating .",
    "however , similar studies in more distant star - forming regions would require sub - arcsecond resolution , for which we will have to wait until the next generation of interferometers is available .",
    "although no ongoing star - formation has been detected so far within this high - latitude cloud , the presence of t tauri stars @xcite outside , but close to the bulk of the co emission ( pound , bania , & wilson 1990 ; zimmerman & ungerechts 1990 ; moriarty - schieven , andersson , & wanner 1997 ) , suggests that , at least in the near past , this cloud has been a star - forming site .",
    "however , it might be possible that these t tauri stars are run - away objects from other star - forming regions",
    ". the detection of embedded young stellar objects would then be the only way to confirm whether mbm 12 is actually a star - forming region .",
    "reach et al .",
    "have determined the presence of dense gas ( @xmath5 @xmath6 , traced by cs emission ) in some areas of mbm 12 , forming clumps in near virial equilibrium ( i.e. , dynamically bound , not just density fluctuations in a turbulent medium ) .",
    "therefore , these are possible pre - stellar cores ( ward - thompson et al .",
    "1994 ) that merit further study .    in this paper",
    ", we present single - dish  observations aimed to search for evidence of on - going star formation in mbm 12 .",
    "observations can be used to identify the presence of current star formation processes .",
    "the ratio between different transitions give us temperature information ( ho & townes 1983 ) .",
    "local heating effects traced by ammonia have been successfully used to locate young stellar objects ( e.g. , gmez et al .",
    "1994 ; girart et al .",
    "moreover , local peaks of linewidth could indicate local turbulence enhancements , which are also very likely associated with star - forming processes .",
    "we also used radio - continuum observations from the very large array ( vla ) of nrao archive , to look for possible embedded young stellar objects .",
    "observations of the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) inversion lines ( rest frequencies @xmath7 ghz , and @xmath8 ghz ) were taken with the 37 m antenna at haystack observatory on 1998 march 17 - 24 , and 1998 may 13 - 15 .",
    "the beam size of the telescope at this frequency is @xmath9 ( which corresponds to @xmath10 pc on mbm 12 ) .",
    "we used a dual maser , cryogenically cooled receiver , which was tuned at a frequency midway between those of the observed lines , and with @xmath11 .",
    "the autocorrelation spectrometer was configured to measure a bandwidth of 53.3 mhz with 1024 lags , which gave a spectral resolution of 62.85 khz ( 0.8 ) .",
    "this system setup allowed us to obtain spectra that included both  lines .",
    "two circular polarizations were also obtained simultaneously .",
    "the rms pointing error was estimated to be @xmath12 , with observations of saturn .",
    "the reference position of our  maps is @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the spectra have all been corrected for antenna gain and atmospheric attenuation .",
    "typical system temperatures are @xmath3 k. the final spectra have been smoothed up to a velocity resolution of 1 , yielding an rms noise level of @xmath15 k. data reduction was performed with the program class of iram and observatoire de grenoble .",
    "we also used archive vla data towards this region .",
    "these data correspond to b - array , 3.6 cm continuum observations , originally taken by d. helfand and j. halpern on 1990 aug 2 , to search for a radio counterpart of the x - ray pulsar h0253 + 193 ( see patterson & halpern 1990 ; zuckerman et al .",
    "an effective bandwidth of 100 mhz , and two circular polarizations were observed .",
    "the phase centre was located at @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the source 1328 + 307 was used as the primary flux calibrator , with an assumed flux density of 5.19 jy .",
    "the phase calibrator was 0235 + 164 , for which a flux density of @xmath18 was derived .",
    "calibration and further image processing was performed with the program aips of nrao .",
    "the resulting synthesized beam was @xmath19 , and the rms noise level @xmath20 mjy beam@xmath21 .",
    "figure [ vmaps ] shows the emission of the ( 1,1 ) line detected at different velocities .",
    "figure [ integ ] shows the integrated intensity map .",
    "several clumps of ammonia emission are evident in this latter figure , the most intense one centred around position offset @xmath22 .",
    "the observed clumps tend to align forming two clear filamentary structures , one extending south to north between position offsets @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and the other one from southeast to northwest between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the morphology seen with our  maps is similar to the one in co ( pound et al .",
    "1990 ; zimmerman & ungerechts 1990 ; moriarty - schieven et al .",
    "1997 ) , and specially to the cs map @xcite .",
    "figure [ spec ] shows an averaged spectrum within a box of @xmath27 around @xmath22 , which includes the  emission from the most intense clump .",
    "apart from the central , main hyperfine component , the satellite lines of ( 1,1 ) are also evident .",
    "no ( 2,2 ) line emission was detected in our spectra .",
    "this emission is not present even in the average within the @xmath27 box around @xmath22 , with an upper limit of @xmath28 k.    no radio continuum emission is detected within the bounds of the ammonia emission , with an upper limit to the flux density of @xmath29 mjy .",
    "only an unresolved source is present within the primary beam of the vla , with a flux density of @xmath30 mjy , at position @xmath31 , @xmath32 ( we name this object as vla b0253 + 192 ) .",
    "note that the phase centre of the vla observations is located at position offset ( 274,038 ) in our  maps , and the primary beam at 3.6 cm is @xmath33 ( fwhm ) .",
    "therefore , this primary beam includes the whole central clump .",
    "the position of vla b0253 + 192 is indicated in figures [ vmaps ] and [ integ ] .",
    "the main goal of our  observations was to identify the presence of on - going star formation processes , by measuring local temperature and turbulence enhancements .    in our data",
    ", the lack of ( 2,2 ) emission indicates a low temperature throughout the mapped area . in particular , from the averaged data for the most intense clump , around @xmath22 ( see fig .",
    "[ spec ] ) , and using the values for the main and inner satellite components @xmath34 k @xmath35 k , @xmath36 k @xmath37 k , @xmath38 k , we derive an optical depth of @xmath39 and an upper limit to the rotational temperature of @xmath40 k. this temperature is similar to those found in other high - latitude clouds , including mbm 7 @xcite , which is close to mbm 12 . it is also expected for this rotational temperature to be close to the value of the local kinetical temperature @xcite .",
    "no local linewidth enhancement is seen in our data .",
    "typical linewidths seem to be unresolved with our 1  velocity resolution .    from these results",
    "we conclude that no indication of current star formation is evident in our  data .",
    "this suggests that t tauri stars seen close to mbm  12 @xcite were formed in a near past , but star - forming processes are no longer going on , at least in the area we mapped .",
    "alternatively , those t tauri stars may be runaway objects from nearby star - formation sites .    however , reach et al .",
    "estimated that mbm 12 is a potential star - forming cloud , given the similar mass derived from the cs integrated intensity and the virial mass .",
    "in our data , for the main clump around @xmath22 , and assuming a @xmath41 k , we estimate a mass of @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the molecular abundance of with respect to h@xmath44 .",
    "the total mass for the clumps mapped in our data is @xmath45 .",
    "these values are consistent with those obtained by reach et al . .",
    "although we see no sign of current star formation processes , the presence of self - gravitating clumps suggests the possibility of these processes to occur in the future .",
    "therefore , given its proximity to the sun , this region is an ideal laboratory to study precollapsing physical conditions , preceding new star formation ( e.g. , ward - thompson et al .",
    "1994 ) .    on the other hand , the radio - continuum source that lie within our sampled area does not seem to be a young stellar object associated to mbm 12 , since it is outside the bounds of the emission .",
    "association with  emission is a known characteristic of young stellar objects @xcite .",
    "the source vla b0253 + 192 is likely to be an extragalactic object .",
    "we thank john ball , kevin dudevoir , and phil shute for their help during the observations at haystack observatory .",
