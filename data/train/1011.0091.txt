    "these high b fields , in particular their toroidal components , impose tremendous stresses on neutron star crusts , and thereby are believed to be the ultimate energy source of magnetar emission ( duncan & thompson 1992 ; thompson & duncan 1993 ) . the strong soft x - ray emission can be empirically modeled with a black body ( _ kt_@xmath40.3 - 0.7kev ) , plus a power law ( @xmath51.5 - 4 ; see e.g. mereghetti 2008 for a review ) , although recently more physically based models have been developed to account for their x - ray spectra ( e.g. lyutikov & gavrill 2006 ; fernandez & thompson 2007 ; rea et al .",

    "all ts values during those outbursts were @xmath925 .",
    "given the relatively high ts values found in five cases by the likelihood analysis , we checked whether the x - ray positions of these magnetars are compatible with the most probable origin of the gamma - ray excesses .",
    "for this purpose , we performed a localization process similar to the one used for the 1fgl catalog , using the pointlike tool , which returns the ts map around each source , where the ts is calculated at any putative source position .",
    "( see fig.1 for two examples of these maps , around  and ) . this tool is applied leaving as free the spectral parameters of the modeled sources within 1@xmath11 of each magnetar .",
    "the results for the magnetar positions with ts@xmath12 are summarized below .",
    "we remember here that all these high - ts sources are in the inner galaxy close to the galactic plane , where the diffuse emission is strong and highly structured , and this could affect our results .    [ [ section ] ]    the gtlike analysis of resulted in a high ts value ( @xmath13 ) . in this case",
    "the pointlike ts map showed a new source very close to the magnetar at an angular distance of 0.11@xmath11 ( ra=280.23@xmath11 , dec=-4.99@xmath11 .",

    "this source is not present in the 1fgl catalog , probably due to the longer time interval analyzed here ( 17 months vs. 11 months for 1fgl ) .",
    "the ts value of falls below 25 when the new source is added to the spectral - spatial model used for the likelihood analysis , and thus we find no evidence to claim the magnetar as a gamma - ray emitter .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    the pointlike analysis for indicated that the position of the magnetar was not a maximum of ts when the coordinates of the modeled source were optimized in the fit .",
    "in particular , we found that the high ts derived by the gtlike analysis could have been caused by the presence of the rather strong unidentified source ( 1fgl j1636.4 - 47371 ) , which lies as close as 0.12@xmath11 from the magnetar ( although positionally incompatible with it ) .",
    "if the spectral parameters of the modeled 1fgl sources are held fixed at their values in the 1fgl catalog , ends up having a ts@xmath436 .",
    "this is what is reported in table1 .",
    "while this is still greater than 25 , the flatness of the ts map around this source suggests that in this region the diffuse galactic emission could be underestimated by the model adopted in the likelihood analysis .",
    "the gtlike analyses of these two magnetars resulted in ts values of @xmath430 for both sources .",

    "before starting with the upper limit determination , we note that for all but one magnetar , the local maximum of ts was not coincident with the magnetar position .",
    "furthermore , by increasing the level of the galactic diffuse emission by 2 - 4% , all of the ts values determined in  3 would decrease below 20 .",
    "these percentages are well inside the systematics of the assumed galactic diffuse emission model ( see the cases of the supernova remnants w51c and w49 , and  4.7 of the 1fgl catalog ; abdo et al . 2009 , 2010d , 2010a ) .",
    "the discovery of gev gamma - rays from magnetars would have major implications , hence would require very strong evidence .",
    "the evidence so far does not seem to reach more than the circumstantial level , and while the _ fermi_-lat exposure continues to accumulate on these sources , we find it appropriate for the time being to report only upper limits .",
    "the upper limits are evaluated by applying the binned likelihood analysis , and using the spectral - spatial models described above .",
    "we derived 95% flux upper limits by fitting a point source at the x - ray magnetar position , for which we increase the flux until the maximum likelihood decreases by 2.71/2 in logarithm .    in the 0.110gev energy range we fix the photon index value of the magnetars to 2.5 , which is the mean of the photon indexes obtained by the previous likelihood analyses .",
    "the other two upper limits are evaluated using spectral index values that mimic a cutoff in the spectrum at @xmath15gev , as common in pulsar spectra .",
    "accordingly , in the range 0.11gev we fix the spectral index to 1.5 , while for 110gev it is set as 3.5 .",
    "the uncertainties of the _ fermi_-lat effective area and of the galactic diffuse emission are the two main sources of systematics that can affect the evaluation of the upper limits .",
    "we estimated the effect of these systematics by repeating the upper limits analysis using modified instrument response functions that bracket the  pass 6 v3 diffuse \" effective areas , and changing the normalization of the galactic diffuse model artificially by @xmath16 .",
    "the results of this analysis are reported in table 1 .",
    "a timing analysis was performed for each of the 13 magnetars studied in this work . with this aim",

    "such log - parabolic spectra can be approximately obtained when relativistic electrons are accelerated by some mechanism and competitively cool via synchrotron or by inverse compton scattering losses .",

    "2007 , 2008 ) as opposed to a log - parabolic form .",
    "one possibility suggested by this is that resonant inverse compton scattering by a population of highly relativistic electrons energized at altitudes below around ten stellar radii may provide this hard x - ray component of magnetars ( see thompson & beloborodov 2005 ; baring & harding 2007 ; nobili , turolla & zane 2008 ) , probably using seed thermal photons emanating from the stellar surface . in this scenario ,",

    "much earlier , cheng & zhang ( 2001 ) and zhang & cheng ( 2002 ) proposed an outer - gap model for magnetar emission above 30 mev , mediated by pairs created at high altitudes in collisions between x - rays originating on or near the surface , and gev - band primary photons from electrons accelerated in the gap .",

    "<S> we report on the search for 0.110gev emission from magnetars in 17 months of _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) observations . </S>",
    "<S> no significant evidence for gamma - ray emission from any of the currently - known magnetars is found . </S>",
    "<S> the most stringent upper limits to date on their persistent emission in the _ fermi _  energy range are estimated between @xmath02 , depending on the source . </S>",
    "<S> we also searched for gamma - ray pulsations and possible outbursts , also with no significant detection . </S>",
    "<S> the upper limits derived support the presence of a cut - off at an energy below a few mev in the persistent emission of magnetars . </S>",
    "<S> they also show the likely need for a revision of current models of outer gap emission from strongly magnetized pulsars , which , in some realizations , predict detectable gev emission from magnetars at flux levels exceeding the upper limits identified here using the _ fermi_-lat observations . </S>"
