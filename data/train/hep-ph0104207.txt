    "the heaviest of all known elementary particles , the top quark , is likely to give us exciting insight into the electroweak symmetry breaking sector of the standard model ( sm ) , into qcd dynamics at short distances and maybe even into physics beyond the sm .",

    "it is based on solving schrdinger equation for green functions in a non - relativistic approximation for a coulombic potential .",
    "the methods needed for the calculation of the total cross section were first given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the differential top quark distributions were calculated independently in position space @xcite and by solving lippmann - schwinger equations in momentum space @xcite .",
    "the polarization of the top quark has been considered in @xcite . in @xcite rescattering corrections ( between @xmath6 and the decay @xmath7 and @xmath8 quarks ) to order @xmath9 were included .",
    "one of the interesting quantities is the top quark longitudinal polarization .",
    "it has been claimed in @xcite that it may easily provide information on the mass and width of the top quark , independently of coulomb type corrections and of the running of the strong coupling @xmath10 .",
    "however , in this article we demonstrate that the helicity of the top quark significantly depends on coulomb type corrections .",
    "moreover , we show that some easily measurable quantities related to the top net helicity strongly depend on rescattering corrections and therefore it requires a more careful analysis to extract from them some information on top quark parameters .",
    "although the nnlo qcd corrections to the total and differential cross section ( excluding rescattering corrections ) for the top quark production in the electron - positron annihilation are already known ( see @xcite and @xcite ; recent results are given in @xcite ) , polarization has not yet been introduced .",
    "a major problem is caused by the rescattering corrections since the inclusion of the interactions between relativistic ( b quark ) and non - relativistic ( t quark ) states is difficult within this formalism .    in section 2",
    "we investigate the top quark net helicity when rescattering corrections are neglected .",
    "we show that large coulomb type corrections affect this observable , in contradiction to the statements made in @xcite . for unstable quarks ,",

    "we show , however , that differences persist in two intuitively acceptable approaches .",
    "inclusion of the phenomenological potential @xmath11 ( see @xcite ) with the two loop static potential , running of the strong coupling constant and a richardson - like potential for small momenta leads to further deviations from @xcite .    in section 3",

    "following @xcite we derive an analogue from the leptonic distributions , taking a more suitable choice of basis vectors .",
    "we show , however , that the latter quantities are significantly affected by the final state interactions .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "the appendix contains the formulas necessary to express the observables of @xcite in a basis aligned with the top quark momentum .",
    "we start from the definition of the angular average of the top quark polarization @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the momentum distribution of the top quark and @xmath14 its polarization .",
    "the angular average of the longitudinal polarization is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a well known function of the electroweak couplings of the t quark to the photon and @xmath17 . in appendix",

    "@xcite we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) as @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the on - shell top quark velocity . in this limit",
    "the longitudinal top polarization is given by @xmath26    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show how eq .",
    "( [ pola ] ) approximates to eq .",
    "( [ pl_lim ] ) as @xmath3 decreases .",
    "although the momentum distributions are getting narrower to simulate the dirac delta function , the limiting value of the polarization of eq .",
    "( [ pola ] ) is reproduced only in the near vicinity of the peak .    in @xcite , the eq .",
    "( [ pl_lim ] ) was used as a starting point .",
    "the finite width was taken into account by changing the dispersion relation @xmath27 which leads to the longitudinal top polarization @xmath28    in a more complete analysis the width is accounted for by momentum distributions . therefore a comparison with eq .",
    "( [ pola4 ] ) requires some averaging .",
    "we shall consider two possibilities . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we take the value of the polarization at the peak of the momentum distribution as function of the energy . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we show the average @xmath29 for the longitudinal part of the top polarization    @xmath30    due to the non - relativistic approximation employed in our calculation of the green functions @xmath23 and @xmath22 , @xmath31 increases logarithmically with @xmath32 .",
    "we show the results for two values of the cut off , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the former cut off corresponds to more then 97% of the total cross section in the energy range between 1s peak and @xmath35  gev . in the latter case about 80% of the total cross section",
    "is included .",
    "so our calculation should be compared with the data sample for a corresponding cut off .    for a pure coulomb potential and positive energies",
    "the formula ( [ pola4 ] ) can be reproduced , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a and fig .  [ fig3]a .",
    "however for negative energies in the region of the 1s peak there are significant differences .",
    "a further improvement in the analysis can be obtained by including the phenomenological potential @xcite .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b and fig .",
    "this time the normalization of the curves is significantly different even in the positive energy region .",
    "we think that the polarization at 1s peak is sensitive to both , the top quark width @xmath3 and @xmath36 energy difference between 1s and 2p peak values .",
    "the formula ( [ pola4 ] ) is not sensitive to @xmath36 and hence in our opinion can not be considered a very good approximation .",
    "due to the extremely short life time of the top quark it will never be possible to carry out any experiment directly on it . the most suitable way of determining the observables discussed here is based on the analysis of charged leptons from the semileptonic decay channel : @xmath37 the average of the charged lepton distribution is relatively easy to settle theoretically as well as experimentally @xmath38 where _ l _ is the four - momentum of the charged lepton and _ n _ is a chosen unit four - vector . in @xcite",
    "it was calculated as    @xmath39 .\\ ] ]    in the @xmath6 center - of - mass frame @xmath40 is the top quark four - momentum and @xmath41 .",
    "the components of @xmath14 turn out to be identical with those of the top quark polarization originating from the s - p wave interference in the process .",
    "thus we consider @xmath14 to represent the polarization .    in @xcite",
    "it was also shown that the largest known corrections to @xmath42 arise from the color interaction between bottom and antitop quarks ( or top and antibottom ) .",
    "an intuitive picture is given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "corrections due to this effect are called rescattering corrections , or final - state corrections , or non - factorizable corrections. it is known that they almost disappear in the total cross sections but they modify the differential distributions ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we implement them in our approach in the same way as we did before ( see appendix a ) .    then the longitudinal top quark polarization , the polarization perpendicular to the top quark momentum and normal to the production plane averaged over the angles are respectively : @xmath43 where",
    "@xmath44    the functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( see  @xcite ) are connected with the rescattering corrections in the @xmath47 system and appear to be of the same order of magnitude .",
    "for @xmath48  gev the coefficients @xmath49 are : @xmath50 and @xmath51 so the corrections to the longitudinal polarization are proportional to @xmath52 and to the perpendicular polarization : @xmath53 .",
    "thus the perpendicular and the normal components of the polarization are almost unchanged by rescattering , but the helicity of the top quark is strongly affected .",
    "we also consider the momentum average of the polarization @xmath54    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the drastic change induced by the the final interactions on  @xmath55 .",
    "the quantity that we wish to compare with @xcite ,  @xmath56 is plotted in fig .",
    "again we see a substantial change in the normalization and the sign with respect to  @xmath56 from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "for completeness we plot the normal and transverse components of the polarization in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and fig .",
    "we have shown that for negative energies relative to the threshold the approximation of @xcite does not include the main characteristics of the longitudinal polarization . even if we neglect the final state interactions the negative energy part is not reproduced .",
    "the phenomenological potential changes the normalization slightly , leading to some differences in the positive energy part as well .",
    "but our non - relativistic approximation is too crude to seriously improve the predictions of  @xcite in this region .",
    "however a drastic difference appears in a full analysis with the rescattering corrections .",
    "it should therefore be obvious that the top quark parameters can not be retrieved from a fit to eq .",
    "( [ pola4 ] ) without the inclusion of the rescattering corrections .",
    "thus the average top quark longitudinal polarization may be a difficult quantity for phenomenological analysis aiming at determination of the top quark couplings .",
    "the size of the rescattering corrections should be viewed as an argument against the longitudinal polarization as a source of top parameters .",
    "an interesting observable weakly affected by the final state interactions is the forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "the authors wish to thank thomas teubner for his support at early stages of this work , helpful comments and careful reading of the manuscript . +",
    "this work is partly supported by the european commission 5th framework contract hprn - ct-2000 - 00149 and by kbn grants 5p03b09320 and 2p03b05418 .",
    "here we would like to show how the results of @xcite can be used to calculate the average top quark helicity .",
    "for the definition of the polarization eq .",
    "( [ pola ] ) , we need the differential cross section which is equal to @xmath57 @xmath58 is the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath59 then the averaged top polarization is @xmath60 the unintegrated polarization distributions @xmath61 , which are the longitudinal @xmath62 , the transverse @xmath63 and the normal polarization @xmath64 , can be easily obtained from the previously calculated polarizations in the beam frame @xcite by a rotation of the basis by an angle @xmath65 ( the angle between top quark and electron momentum ) in the production plane .",
    "then @xmath66 the index _ e _ was used to indicate that the quantities are given in the basis aligned with the electron momentum .",
    "we also use @xmath67 the needed coefficients are  @xcite + with @xmath68 the following conventions for the fermion couplings are used : @xmath69 .",
    "the parameter @xmath70 can be interpreted as the effective longitudinal polarization of the virtual intermediate photon or @xmath71 boson : + @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes the longitudinal electron / positron polarization .    in an analogous and quite straightforward way the rescattering corrections can be incorporated in our approach ; we only have to shift the polarizations @xmath74 and the forward - backward asymmetry , as given in @xcite .",
