    "the detailed analysis of the irreducible pion re - scattering operator was recently performed @xcite for the reaction @xmath1 .",
    "the pion re - scattering is certainly part of the pion production mechanism , but its importance relative to other contributions varies considerably dependent on the approximations made in evaluation of the effective operators ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the nature and extent of this uncertainty are re - examined in this paper .",
    "to this end we deal with retardation effects in the exchanged pion propagator , i.e. , its energy dependence , as well as with the energy dependence of the @xmath2n scattering amplitude in the vertex , from which the produced pion is emitted . while the approximations employed in a previous paper @xcite yield rather different results , we show here that the deviations between them are significantly reduced when the approximations are applied consistently in the whole effective operator .",
    "we also show that the s - matrix approach , which has been successfully used below pion production threshold , yields also above threshold results rather close to those obtained with the energy - dependent operator following from time - ordered perturbation theory .    the paper is organized as follows :",
    "after this introduction , section ii describes the s - matrix technique for deriving effective nuclear quantum - mechanical operators , section iii describes the results and section iv presents a summary and conclusions .",
    "to derive the effective pion production operators , and other effective nuclear operators in general , one starts from the relativistic ( effective ) lagrangian written in terms of hadronic fields .",
    "the interactions mediated by meson exchanges before and after the production reaction takes place are included in the effective @xmath0 ( and nucleon - meson ) interaction , while from the irreducible parts connected to the reaction mechanism ( e.g. , pion production ) one obtains effective operators , whose expectation values are to be evaluated between the initial and final nucleonic wave functions .",
    "one aims is to get such effective operators consistent with the realistic description of the @xmath0 interaction , which can then be used in studies of the corresponding reactions not only on the simplest ( one or two - nucleon ) systems , but preferably also on heavier nuclei .",
    "the covariant techniques based on the bethe - salpeter equation or its quasipotential re - arrangements are these days practically manageable only below meson production threshold . however , above the threshold the dressings of the single hadron propagators and interaction vertices via the meson loops have to be included explicitly . for this reason",
    "the construction of the production operator is so far realized mostly in the hamiltonian quantum - mechanical framework ( usually non - relativistic , or with leading relativistic effects included perturbatively within the decomposition in powers of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is typical hadronic momentum and @xmath5 is the nucleon mass ) .",
    "the derivation of the nuclear effective operators below the meson production threshold within the hamiltonian framework  leading to hermitian and energy independent @xmath0 and @xmath6 potentials and conserved e.m .  and partially conserved weak current operators  can be done in many different ways ( see discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . at the non - relativistic order",
    "the results are determined uniquely . as for the leading order",
    "relativistic contributions , they were shown to be unitarily equivalent .",
    "the unitary freedom allows to choose the @xmath0 potentials to be static ( in the c.m .",
    "frame of two - nucleon system ) and identify them with the successful static semi - phenomenological potentials .    also above the threshold the static limit",
    "is commonly employed , since more elaborate descriptions which include the mesonic retardation and loop effects are technically considerably more complex @xcite , especially for systems of more than two nucleons .",
    "both the static approaches and the ones including `` retardation '' typically consider contributions of several one - meson exchanges and the potentials are fitted to describe the data .",
    "it is therefore difficult to assess how well do they approximate the covariant amplitudes ( corresponding to the same values of physical masses and coupling constants ) which are so far outside the scope of existing calculations schemes , but which we believe do provide in principle the consistent description of the considered reactions .",
    "thus , the ultimately exact approach to the description of the pion production ( and in particular of the pion re - scattering contribution ) would be either the covariant bethe - salpeter or quasipotential frameworks ( extended above the pion threshold ) or the quantum mechanical coupled - channel technique including retardation . in these approaches",
    "one has to treat the non - hermitian energy - dependent @xmath0 interaction ( fitted to the data also above pion production threshold ) and consider the effects of renormalization of vertices , masses and wave functions via meson loops .    in this paper",
    "we rather ( following refs .",
    "@xcite ) numerically estimate the range of the predictions from several commonly used simplifying approximations , and compare them to the result obtained from the reduction of the corresponding covariant feynman diagrams for the pion re - scattering operator .",
    "this reduction coincides with the time - ordered perturbation theory@xcite .      in a previous paper @xcite we made the connection to the usual representation of the pion re - scattering operator for non - relativistic calculations by following the approach of refs .",
    "we started from the covariant two - nucleon feynman amplitudes including final and initial state interaction ( fsi and isi , respectively ) , shown in figs .",
    "[ diagrams1]a and [ diagrams1]b .",
    "interaction by solid double line and the nucleons by solid lines . ]    to obtain the effective re - scattering operator the negative energy contributions in the nucleon propagators ( to be included in the complete calculations ) were neglected . by integrating subsequently over the energy of the exchanged pion",
    "the resulting feynman amplitudes were transformed into those following from the time - ordered perturbation theory .",
    "we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the irreducible `` stretched box diagrams '' ( i.e. , those with more than one meson in flight in the intermediate states ) give a very small contribution and can be therefore also neglected .",
    "thus , the full covariant amplitude is in the lowest order born approximation well approximated by the product of the @xmath0 potential and the effective pion re - scattering operator , which can be extracted from these time - ordered diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ diagrams2 ] ) .",

    "however , for the isi case there are values of the exchanged pion three - momentum for which the propagator @xmath8 has poles .",
    "these poles have been considered in all our numerical calculations for the cross section . as we will see , they are one of the main reasons for deviations between several approximations and the reference results calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ afsi]-[vsig ] ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that although the fsi and isi diagrams graphically separate the @xmath0 interaction and the pion re - scattering part ( when the stretched boxes are neglected ) , they do not define a _",

    "is not conserved at individual vertices , each of these diagrams defines a different off - energy shell extension of the pion re - scattering amplitude .",
    "this is an unpleasant feature , since one would have to make an analogous construction for diagrams with both fsi and isi .",
    "moreover , one would have to repeat the whole analysis for systems of more than two nucleons . only after the on - shell approximation is made ( in the next subsection ) , the pion re - scattering parts of fsi and isi diagrams coincide and one can identify them with a single effective re - scattering operator .      the s - matrix technique is a simple prescription to derive the effective nuclear operators from the corresponding covariant feynman diagrams @xcite . for electromagnetic operators and also for @xmath0 and @xmath6 potentials",
    "the s - matrix approach reproduces the results of more laborious constructions , based on time - ordered or non - relativistic diagram techniques .",
    "the two - nucleon effective operators are by definition identified with the diagrams describing the irreducible mechanism of the corresponding reaction .",

    "are defined to be consistent with a hermitian energy independent @xmath0 potential , which has the usual one boson exchange form employed in realistic models of @xmath0 interaction , and can be used also in systems of more than two nucleons .",
