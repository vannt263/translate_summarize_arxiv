    "<S> we theoretically establish the mean - field phase diagram of a homogeneous spin-@xmath0 , spin - orbit coupled bose gas as a function of the spin - dependent interaction parameter , the raman coupling strength and the quadratic zeeman shift . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the interplay between spin - orbit coupling and spin - dependent interactions leads to the occurrence of ferromagnetic or ferronematic phases which also break translational symmetry . for weak raman coupling </S>",
    "<S> , increasing attractive spin - dependent interactions ( as in @xmath1rb or @xmath2li ) induces a transition from a uniform to a stripe xy ferromagnet ( with no nematic order ) . for repulsive spin - dependent interactions </S>",
    "<S> however ( as in @xmath3na ) , we find a transition from an @xmath4 spin spiral phase ( @xmath5 and uniform total density ) with uniaxial nematic order , to a biaxial ferronematic , where the total density , spin vector and nematic director oscillate in real space . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the stability of these phases against the quadratic zeeman effect , which generally tends to favor uniform phases with either ferromagnetic or nematic order but not both . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the relevance of our results to ongoing experiments on spin - orbit coupled , spinor bose gases . </S>"
