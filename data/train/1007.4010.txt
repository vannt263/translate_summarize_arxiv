    "ions confined in radio - frequency ( rf ) traps are regarded as one of the most promising approaches towards quantum information processing @xcite , as well as for quantum simulators @xcite and frequency standards @xcite .",

    "the absolute accuracy of the wavemeter is specified to be 200 mhz below 370 nm and 60 mhz between 370 nm - 1100 nm , so the 369.5 nm wavelengths are inferred by measuring the wavelength of the 739.05 nm beam and doubling the frequency , resulting in an error of 120 mhz .",

    "as this transition is used for doppler cooling , blue detuning the laser from the resonant transition frequency results in ion heating and an immediate drop in fluorescence , and therefore allows linewidth broadening to be neglected for these measurements .",
    "fortunately , the resonance frequencies for this transition are determined by the immediate drop in fluorescence at the centre of resonance , and so is independent of linewidth broadening . repeating the measurements at an intensity of 0.8 wcm@xmath9 ,",
