    "the x - shooter instrument @xcite of the vlt is an echelle slit spectrograph that covers the very wide wavelength range from 0.3 to 2.5 by three arms called uvb ( 0.30 to 0.59 ) , vis ( 0.53 to 1.02 ) , and nir ( 0.99 to 2.48 ) .",
    "this allows one to study various airglow bands simultaneously , as demonstrated by @xcite , who investigated 25 ( @xmath1-@xmath25 ) bands between 0.58 and 2.24 with @xmath1 from 2 to 9 . since x - shooter is an instrument for observing astronomical targets , airglow studies have to rely on archival , unprocessed spectra , which differ in terms of line of sight , exposure time , and slit - dependent spectral resolution . for this study , we have used the same data set that was selected and processed by @xcite .",
    "the extended analysis of these data , therefore , focuses on the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands ( see sect .  [",

    "for the flux calibration , response curves were created based on data of spectrophotometric standard stars @xcite corrected for molecular absorption @xcite and atmospheric extinction @xcite . due to the instability of the flat - field calibration lamps for the correction of the pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations in the 2-d echelle spectra , the fluxes of long wavelengths beyond 1.9 including the bands and are relatively uncertain . for 77% of the data ,",
    "this could be improved by means of spectra of standard stars with known spectral shapes , i.e. rayleigh  jeans slopes .    from the processed data ,",
    "a  sample of 343 vis- and nir - arm spectra was selected .",
    "the selection criteria were a  minimum exposure time of 3 , a  maximum slit width of 1.5@xmath26 corresponding to @xmath27 for the vis arm and 3300 for the nir arm , and a  difference in start , end , and length of the exposure between vis and nir arm of less than 5 .",
    "the latter was necessary since the observations in the different x - shooter arms can be performed independently .",
    "moreover , 21% of the combined vis- and nir - arm spectra were rejected due to unreliable @xmath0 in at least one of the 25 investigated bands .",
    "this can be caused by low data quality , an  erroneous data reduction , or critical contaminations by residuals of the observed astronomical object .",

    "for this reason , we limited the sample by the criterion @xmath34 , which resulted in 1685 profiles . a  further reduction of the longitude range is not prudent because then there could be too few profiles for representative results for time and/or seasonal averages .",

    "for this reason , we needed to obtain saber - specific parameters such as @xmath108 and @xmath97 for each x - shooter spectrum .",
    "we achieved this by smoothing the saber data in the two dimensions day of year ( doy ) and time .",
    "as a  smoothing filter , we used a  2-d gaussian with @xmath95 of half a  month ( 15.2  days ) and half an  hour .",
    "the gaussians were calculated across the new year boundary if required . for each x - shooter data point",

    "a  suitable smoothing procedure is crucial since both data sets have large gaps . in particular ,",
    "the saber data for our selected area around cerro paranal only cover a  very narrow range of times for a  certain doy ( see sect .  [",

    "it is desirable to average as many saber data as possible to obtain reliable mean values .",
    "however , if this requires to add data taken at very different conditions , this might cancel out variability patterns that are required for realistic corrections .",
    "the saber data set is already a  compromise since it includes data that were taken several 100 away from cerro paranal .",
    "hence , we checked the influence of the smoothing procedure on the resulting weighted parameters .",
    "focusing on the x - shooter sample mean @xmath108 for the eight , two , and one reference emission layers ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : profiles ] ) , we found a  mean change of about 0.1 for a  bisection of the gaussian @xmath95 .",
    "a  doubling of the limiting periods resulted in a  corresponding mean shift of about 0.2 .",
    "moreover , a  different smoothing function ( e.g. an  exponential function with a  flat top for distances smaller than @xmath95 ) had little influence on the results . finally , the introduction of the solar activity ( measured by the solar radio flux ) as a  third dimension did not significantly change the resulting @xmath108 either",
    "therefore , we conclude that the details of the smoothing procedure for the saber data are not critical for our analysis .    the main contributions to the weighted parameter averages mainly originate from a  relatively small fraction of the saber data . within the @xmath110 perimeter of the 2-d gaussian around the cerro paranal data points , the number of saber profiles ranges from 0 to 41 for our applied procedure .",
    "the mean is 12 .",
    "if a  weight sum is used ( defining weight  @xmath111 in the centre of the gaussian ) , values between 4 and 49 with a  mean of 23 are found .",
    "these numbers suggest that profile - to - profile variations limit the accuracy of the resulting averages .",
    "this is confirmed by typical @xmath108 mean errors between 1.3 ( @xmath3 ) and 1.9 ( @xmath2 ) for individual x - shooter observations .",

    "sec : o2aprof ] .",
    "the uncertainties for the sample mean are negligible .",
    "the most critical source of error is probably a  significant deviation of the @xmath108 climatologies from those related to the cerro paranal x - shooter data .",

    "our preferred reference profile at 90 can not be used in this context since @xmath0 measurements do not exist . for this reason",
    ", we calculated the standard deviations for all possible band combinations and performed a  regression analysis depending on the related height differences @xmath113 .",
    "then , the climatology - related uncertainties can be estimated only based on differences of emission altitudes .",
    "this approach assumes that @xmath97 is the major driver for the changes in the variability pattern , which is likely since the widths of the emission layers do not differ a  lot .",
    "moreover , a  linear change of the variability with @xmath113 is required , which is more difficult to fulfil if the height differences are relatively large .",
    "significant variations of the non - lte effects could influence the fit ( see sect .  [",

    "the fit is robust since the uncertainties of both values are lower by more than an  order of magnitude . for a  change from a  band - specific emission profile to our reference profile , the linear fit results in systematic errors in the temperature correction by the different climatologies for the saber and x - shooter data between 0.7 for ( @xmath8 ) and 2.0 for @xmath2 . for the discussion of seasonal variations in sect .",

    "<S> rotational temperatures @xmath0 derived from lines of the same band are an important method to study the dynamics and long - term trends in the mesopause region near 87 . to measure realistic temperatures , the rotational level populations have to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , this might not be fulfilled , especially at high emission altitudes . in order to quantify possible non - lte contributions to the @xmath0 as a function of the upper vibrational level @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , we studied a sample of 343 echelle spectra taken with the x - shooter spectrograph at the very large telescope at cerro paranal in chile . </S>",
    "<S> these data allowed us to analyse 25 bands in each spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we could measure lines of @xmath2 , which peaks at about 94 to 95 , and @xmath3 with an emission peak at about 90 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter altitude is reached in the second half of the night after a rise of several because of the decay of a daytime population of excited . </S>",
    "<S> since the radiative lifetimes for the upper levels of the two bands are relatively long , the derived @xmath0 are not significantly affected by non - lte contributions . </S>",
    "<S> these bands are well suited for a comparison with if the differences in the emission profiles are corrected . for different sample averages </S>",
    "<S> , we made these corrections by using emission , @xmath3 emission , and -based temperature profile data from the multi - channel radiometer saber on the timed satellite . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure relies on differences of profile - weighted saber temperatures . for an @xmath3-based reference profile at 90 </S>",
    "<S> , we found a good agreement of the with the saber - related temperatures , whereas the temperatures , especially for the high and even @xmath1 , showed significant excesses with a maximum of more than 10 for @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the exact value depends on the selected lines and molecular parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we could also find a nocturnal trend towards higher non - lte effects , particularly for high @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of these variations can be about 2 or less , which tends to be significantly smaller than the total amount of the non - lte contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the variations revealed may be important for dynamical studies based on @xmath0 derived from bands with high @xmath1 .    [ sec : intro ]    studies of long - term trends as well as short - term variations of the temperature in the mesopause region are often based on so - called rotational temperatures @xmath0 derived from emission lines of the hydroxyl ( ) airglow ( e.g. * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ) , which is mostly caused by the chemical reaction of hydrogen ( ) and ozone ( ) @xcite at a  typical height of 87 ( e.g. * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ) . </S>",
    "<S> ground - based instruments usually measure the intensities of a  few lines with different rotational upper levels @xmath5 of a  single band ( e.g. * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ) . </S>",
    "<S> assuming a  boltzmann distribution of the populations at the different rotational levels , a  temperature can be derived , which is reliable if the frequency of thermalising collisions is high compared to the natural radiative lifetime of a  state . </S>",
    "<S> the latter ranges from about 58 to 5 for the relevant upper vibrational levels @xmath6 to 9 of the electronic ground state @xcite . for the peak emission height </S>",
    "<S> , this appears to be sufficiently long to establish the assumed boltzmann distribution @xcite </S>",
    "<S> .    however , at higher altitudes with lower air density , collisions may be too infrequent , especially for the higher @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the measured @xmath0 can deviate from the true temperatures due to the contribution of a  population of molecules , where the condition of a  local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) for the rotational levels is not fulfilled . </S>",
    "<S> comparisons of @xmath0 from various bands differing in @xmath1 show clear signatures of such non - lte effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the measured @xmath0 tend to increase with @xmath1 and even @xmath1 appear to indicate higher @xmath0 than the adjacent odd @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , the highest @xmath0 are found for bands with @xmath7 . as discussed by @xcite , this </S>",
    "<S> can only be explained by a  significant impact of a  nearly nascent vibrational and rotational level distribution related to the hydrogen  ozone reaction , which mostly populates @xmath8 and 8 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the differences in the results for even and odd @xmath1 can then be understood by the higher initial @xmath0 for @xmath9 @xcite and the high probability of radiative transitions with @xmath10 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 non - lte contributions also appear to vary with time , as observed by @xcite . at cerro </S>",
    "<S> paranal ( 24.6s ) , they tend to enhance during the night when data of several years are averaged . </S>",
    "<S> this is probably caused by a  rising emission layer , which can be inferred from a  decrease of the measured intensity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> apart from @xmath1 , the measured @xmath0 are also strongly affected by the choice of lines . </S>",
    "<S> higher @xmath5 tend to show stronger non - lte contributions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , only lines of the first three or four rotational levels are usually used for @xmath0 derivations ( e.g. * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ) . however , even this restriction is not sufficient to obtain line - independent @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic ground level has two substates , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> population differences of several per cent were found by @xcite for rotational levels of the same substate and for comparisons between the two substates .    </S>",
    "<S> the approach to estimate temperatures in the mesopause region by means of airglow lines with different rotational upper levels can also be applied to bands of molecular oxygen ( ) . however , long ground - based time series are only available for ( @xmath13 ) at about @xmath14 ( e.g. * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ) , which is sufficiently bright , hardly blended by lines , and not affected by self - absorption in the lower atmosphere like the stronger band . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath2 remains unresolved with the standard instruments in use , a  simulation of the temperature dependence of the band shape is required ( e.g. * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",

    "<S> this suggests that @xmath2 @xmath0 are not significantly affected by non - lte contributions . </S>",

    "<S> transitions from the @xmath18 state of to the ground state @xmath19 are more promising since the measured nighttime emission peak heights of the band at 1.27 are close to those of @xcite . during most of the night , </S>",
    "<S> they are at about 90 . at the beginning of the night </S>",
    "<S> , the effective emission heights can be several lower . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour is caused by the contribution of a  daytime - related @xmath18 excitation by ozone photolysis to the nighttime - related atomic oxygen recombination @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the former is relevant for the night since the spontaneous radiative lifetime of @xmath18 is about 75min due to an  einstein-@xmath16 coefficient of about @xmath20 for the band @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the daytime emission peaks at about 50 @xcite and effectively rises in altitude after sunset up to the nighttime peak due to the faster decay of the @xmath18 population by collisional quenching at lower altitudes . </S>",

    "<S> these efforts might explain the lack of @xmath3 @xmath0 in the literature . as an  alternative , @xmath3 can be used . </S>",
    "<S> although this band is fairly weak and partly blended with strong lines , it was studied by @xcite using spectroscopic data taken at zvenigorod , russia ( 55.7n ) , from 2010 to 2011 . </S>",

    "<S> the data were already discussed by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as x - shooter covers the wavelength range from 0.3 to 2.5 with a  resolving power of at least @xmath22 , the different and bands can be studied in parallel and without the need of band simulations for the @xmath0 retrieval . </S>",
    "<S> the resolution is sufficient to measure individual lines even in @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> we will not directly compare the derived @xmath0 since the studied bands probe different parts of the mesopause temperature profile due to the differences in the altitude distributions of the emission . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the significant changes in the emission profile of @xmath3 @xcite have to be corrected . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , we will use volume emission rate ( ver ) and temperature profiles from satellite observations to derive temperature corrections depending on the ver differences of the bands to be compared . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose , data of the ten - channel broad - band radiometer saber @xcite on the timed satellite launched in 2001 are most suited . </S>",
    "<S> the limb sounder measures profiles of the crucial @xmath3 band and two -related channels at 1.64 and 2.06 , which probe different upper vibrational levels @xmath1 ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; see * ? ? ? </S>",

    "<S> the latter is important since the emission peak heights depend on @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
