    "understanding the origin of flavor has been a major goal of particle physics research for last few decades .",
    "the observed patterns of quark as well as lepton mixing and the fact that they are very different from each other remain very puzzling till today .",
    "apart from the mixing , the hierarchies in the masses of fermions in the standard model ( sm ) are also making the flavor problem even more puzzling .",
    "for example , there is a hierarchy of six orders of magnitude between the lightest charged lepton and the heaviest quark .",
    "the observed hierarchy between up type quarks , down type quarks and the charged leptons can be summarized as @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 the mixing of quarks in weak interactions is described by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite . using the wolfenstein parameterization @xcite , the quark mixing angles are given by @xmath7 where the parameters have their measured values reported by particle data group @xcite as @xmath8 @xmath9 thus the quark mixing angles are very small and show a hierarchy @xmath10 .",
    "this hierarchy among the mixing angles comes very close to the hierarchy of the quark masses and could hint towards an underlying relation between them .",
    "several earlier works @xcite have been dedicated to relating quark mixing angles to the quark mass hierarchies .    on the other hand , neutrino masses which remain vanishing in the sm , have been found to be tiny but non - zero by several neutrino experiments @xcite .",
    "the neutrino masses are found to obey a weaker hierarchy compared to the charged fermion masses .",
    "this can be seen from the global fit data of neutrino mass squared differences that have appeared in the recent analysis of @xcite and @xcite , listed in table [ tab : data1 ] and [ tab : data2 ] respectively .",
    ".global fit @xmath11 values of neutrino oscillation parameters @xcite . here",
    "@xmath12 for nh and @xmath13 for ih . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the above tables not only show weaker mass hierarchy among neutrinos , but also show how different leptonic mixing angles are from quark mixing angles .",
    "the leptonic mixing angles , at least two of them : the solar and atmospheric mixing angles @xmath14 are found to be unexpectedly large and do not seem to have any straightforward connection to the charged lepton mass hierarchies",
    ".    it may be possible that quark and lepton mixing have completely different dynamical origin .",
    "a slightly old review of quark and lepton mixing can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is however more predictive and economical if a common framework can explain these two different mixing together .",
    "motivated by the presence of a grand unified theory at a very high energy scale , several recent as well as past works have discussed a common framework to understand the origin of quark and lepton mixing together . some of these works can be found in @xcite and references therein . in this letter",
    ", we adopt the framework used earlier in the works @xcite to relate the lepton mixing angles with lepton mass hierarchy .",
    "since quark mixing angles are closely related to the quark mass hierarchy , similar relation in the leptonic sector will put quarks and leptons on equal footing , which is expected in a unified theory of all fermions .",
    "similar to these earlier works , here also we adopt a model independent approach and start with the conjecture that mixing angles in lepton sectors are related to the lepton mass ratios in the following way @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mixing angle either in charged lepton or neutrino sector and @xmath17 are masses of leptons such that @xmath18 .",
    "we show that , if all three mixing angles in charged lepton sector are related to the charged lepton mass ratios and all three mixing angles in the neutrino sector are related to the neutrino mass ratios as in equation , then correct values of all three leptonic mixing angles can not be generated simultaneously for all ranges of lightest neutrino mass .",
    "we show that correct leptonic mixing angles can be generated within their @xmath11 allowed ranges , if two of the mixing angles in each of charged lepton and neutrino sectors are related to the respective mass ratio in a way shown in equation , leaving the third mixing angles in both the sectors as free parameters .",
    "this also constrains the charged lepton as well as neutrino mass matrices to some specific structures , which can be written in terms of the third mixing angle and the lightest neutrino mass .",
    "we then constrain the free parameters namely , the lightest neutrino mass and the difference between the third mixing angles in the two sectors from the requirement of producing correct leptonic mixing angles . we also show how to realize some specific texture zeros in the neutrino mass matrix within this framework .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : sec2 ] , we outline and describe the formalism we adopt . in section [ conclude ] we briefly mention our results and conclude .",
    "the @xmath19 unitary mixing matrix associated with either quark or lepton mixing can be parameterized as a product of three rotation matrices in three different planes @xmath20 where @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the dirac cp phase .",
    "the ckm mixing matrix in the quark sector can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 are two of the four unitary matrices required to diagonalize the up and down type quark mass matrices . expressing both of these mixing matrices as products of three rotation matrices shown in equation , one can express the ckm matrix as @xmath26 since quark mixing angles are closely related to quark mass hierarchies , assuming negligible @xmath27 mixing ( due to strong hierarchy between first and third generation quark masses ) , a convenient representation of ckm matrix was suggested by @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 can be parameterized in terms of an angle @xmath30 and a phase @xmath31 .",
    "the rotation matrices @xmath32 are parameterized by angle @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 interchangeably .",
    "difference may arise in the neutrino sector due to weaker mass hierarchies , we do not get correct result using @xmath35 in the leptonic sector and hence adopt @xmath36 in rest of our work . ] which is very close to the observed pattern of quark masses and mixing and encourages one to look into the lepton sector carefully and check whether such a relation between mixing angles and mass hierarchy exists .    the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) leptonic mixing matrix",
    "is related to the diagonalizing matrices of neutrino and charged lepton mass matrices @xmath37 respectively , as @xmath38 using a similar approach discussed above in the case of quarks , the authors of @xcite proposed a parameterization of leptonic mixing given by @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "here we are ignoring the cp phases , both dirac and majorana . assuming solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations to be decoupled , the three leptonic mixing angles observed in neutrino oscillations are given by @xmath41 the authors further conjectured that the mixing angles @xmath42 could be related to the lepton mass ratios @xmath43 in a way given in equation .",
    "the smallness of @xmath44 therefore , was attributed to the strong hierarchy in the charged lepton sector .",
    "however , the value of @xmath44 in this framework came out to be very small , around @xmath45 , which is ruled out by present neutrino data .",
    "we therefore , do not assume the parameterization of @xmath46 to be similar to @xmath47 , given by equation in this work .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that hierarchy in the lepton sector ( neutrinos , in particular ) are very different from the quark sector and hence the assumptions used in the derivation of the above parameterization of @xmath47 need not be valid for @xmath46 .    instead",
    ", we consider a general analysis first where all mixing angles in charged lepton as well as neutrino sector are related to the corresponding mass hierarchies in a way shown by equation .",
    "this help us to determine the structure of charged lepton mass matrix ( assuming to be symmetric ) completely and the neutrino mass matrix in terms of one free parameter , the lightest neutrino mass .",
    "these mass matrices , in general contain cp phases which we are ignoring in our work as they are not going to affect our main results substantially . after showing that this formalism does not give rise to the correct leptonic mixing angles",
    ", we then assume the validity of the relation between mixing angles and mass hierarchies to be restricted to only two mixing angles in each of charged lepton and neutrino sector , whereas the third mixing angle in both the sectors are free parameters .",
    "we show that this scenario can give rise to the leptonic mixing angles within their @xmath11 range .",
    "this formalism allows us to construct the symmetric charged lepton mass matrix upto one free parameter , and the neutrino mass matrix upto two free parameters .",

    "we also check the variation of the mixing angles and dirac cp phase with the parameter @xmath23 in the mixing matrix and found no correlation between them .",

    "similarly , the neutrino mass matrix can also be written as @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "it should be noted that for symmetric majorana neutrino mass matrices , the mass matrix can be constructed as @xmath92 however , there are additional majorana cp phases apart from the dirac cp phase in such a scenario",

    "they are given by @xmath103 @xmath104 these structures may indicate the presence of additional flavor symmetries like frogatt - nielsen type @xcite which we do not investigate in this present work .",
    "it is worth checking whether we still have some freedom left to adjust the free parameters in such a way to reduce the mass matrices into simpler form .",
    "in particular , we check whether the mass matrices can have zeros , so called texture zero mass matrices @xcite .",
    "these texture zeros not only make the theory more predictive and minimal but could also indicate the presence of additional symmetries behind them .",
    "for illustrative purpose , we derive the conditions for some one - zero textures in the majorana neutrino mass matrix in this work .",

    "however these values are outside the range of @xmath65 required to produce correct leptonic mixing angle as seen from figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "thus this particular one - zero texture is not possible in this scenario .",
    "* @xmath108 @xmath109 the constraint @xmath110 gives rise to two equations involving three free parameters @xmath111 . since neutrino parameters are not sensitive to the choice of @xmath23 and we also have a freedom in choosing @xmath93 provided @xmath64 lies in the desired range as discussed above , this particular one - zero texture can be realized in these frameworks .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn for other possible one - zero textures as well .",
    "since we have three free parameters in the neutrino mass matrix , it will be worth investigating whether two - zero textures are possible in this framework .",
    "similarly we can also study the possibility of simpler charged lepton mass matrix with texture zeros and constrain the mixing angle @xmath87 .",
    "these we leave for future investigations .",
    "we have studied the possibility of relating lepton mixing angles to lepton mass hierarchies . guided by the existence of such relations in the quark sector , we also consider the mixing angles associated with charged lepton mass matrix and neutrino mass matrix to be related to the corresponding mass ratios .",
    "we show that , if we assume three mixing angles each in charged lepton and neutrino sectors to be related to three respective mass ratios , then the pmns leptonic mixing matrix in the absence of cp violation can be constructed with one free parameter , the lightest neutrino mass .",
    "we vary this lightest neutrino mass both for normal and inverted hierarchical neutrino masses and show that all the three leptonic mixing angles can not be generated simultaneously within their @xmath11 range .",
    "we check that this overall conclusion does not change even if we take the leptonic dirac cp phase into account .",
    "we then consider the validity of the relation between mixing angles and mass hierarchies to be restricted to only two mixing angles in each sector , charged lepton and neutrino . for simplicity , we consider 1 - 2 and 1 - 3 mixing angles to be related to the corresponding mass ratios and 2 - 3 mixing angles @xmath112 are kept as a free parameters .",
    "we also consider the origin of leptonic cp violation in the 2 - 3 sector and insert a phase term @xmath23 in the 2 - 3 rotation matrices .",
    "we then calculate the leptonic mixing angles and dirac cp phase as a function of @xmath113 and the lightest neutrino mass .",
    "we show that for normal hierarchical neutrino masses , we can generate all the three leptonic mixing angles simultaneously in their correct @xmath11 range provided the lightest neutrino mass @xmath65 approximately lie around @xmath0 ev . we have also constrained the leptonic dirac cp phase to the range @xmath2 so as to generate all the neutrino mixing angles in the correct @xmath11 range . instead of taking 2 - 3 mixing angles as free parameters , one could take either 1 - 2 or 1 - 3 mixing angles as free parameters . in that case , the leptonic mixing angles will be functions of three free parameters instead of two in the minimal scenario discussed here .",
    "we then construct the charged lepton mass matrix with two free parameters , the @xmath3 mixing angle @xmath87 and the phase @xmath23 assuming it to be symmetric .",
    "we also construct the neutrino mass matrix upto three free parameters , the lightest neutrino mass , the 2 - 3 mixing angle @xmath93 and the phase @xmath23 .",
    "to arrive at a simpler structure of mass matrices , we then assume specific values of @xmath97 and lightest neutrino mass @xmath114 ev consistent with correct pmns mixing angles from the plot shown in figure [ fig2 ] , and derive the mass mass matrices in terms of wolfenstein parameter @xmath100 .",
    "we further make a few remarks on the possibility of realizing some specific texture zeros in the majorana neutrino mass matrix .",
    "we show that @xmath106 texture is not possible whereas @xmath110 is allowed within this framework .",
    "similar studies can also be done to see the possibility of two - zero textures in the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "one can also constrain @xmath87 so as to allow texture zeros in the charged lepton mass matrix .",
    "it should be noted that we have considered the violation of the relation between mass ratios and mixing angles and origin of leptonic cp phase to be only in the 2 - 3 sector , whereas they can occur in 1 - 2 or 1 - 3 sector as well .",
    "we leave such a detailed study considering 1 - 2 or 1 - 3 mixing angles as free parameters instead of just @xmath3 mixing angles , possibility of texture zeros in both charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices to future work .",
    "these textures not only make the framework more predictive and minimal but also hint at an underlying symmetry behind them .",
    "future measurement of neutrino mixing angles with more precision , smaller @xmath11 ranges and determination of absolute neutrino mass should be able to falsify the scenarios discussed in this work .",
    "discovery of inverted hierarchy in neutrino experiments will also rule out the scenario discussed in the present work .",
    "similarly , experimental measurement of leptonic dirac cp phase will also falsify our framework as it predicts a narrow range of @xmath1 such that @xmath2 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this range is already disfavored by the recent hint of @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "however , more data are required to confirm such a measurement .",

    "<S> we show that for both normal and inverted hierarchical neutrino masses , this scenario does not give rise to correct leptonic mixing angles . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that correct leptonic mixing angles can be generated with normal hierarchical neutrino masses if the relation between mixing angle and mass ratio is restricted to 1 - 2 and 1 - 3 mixing in both charged lepton and neutrino sectors leaving the 2 - 3 mixing angles as free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we then restrict the lightest neutrino mass as well as the difference between 2 - 3 mixing angles in charged lepton and neutrino sectors from the requirement of producing correct leptonic mixing angles . </S>",
    "<S> we constrain the lightest neutrino mass to be around @xmath0 ev and leptonic dirac cp phase @xmath1 such that @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we also construct the leptonic mass matrices in terms of @xmath3 mixing angles and lightest neutrino mass and briefly comment on the possibility of realizing texture zeros in the neutrino mass matrix . </S>"
