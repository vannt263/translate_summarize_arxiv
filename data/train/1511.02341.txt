    "the last few years have witnessed a growing interest in electromagnetic radiation carrying orbital angular momentum ( oam ) , which has found relevant applications in nanotechnologies @xcite , astronomy @xcite , quantum physics @xcite , optics @xcite and radio communications @xcite .",
    "oam beams represent classes of solutions to the helmholtz equation characterized by a wavefront which consists of @xmath3 intertwined helices , described by the azimuthal phase term @xmath4 , where @xmath3 is the oam mode index , and a doughnut - shaped beam profile for @xmath5 .",
    "each class comprises a theoretically infinite set of orthogonal solutions which offers , in principle , the possibility to encode separate channels on the same frequency , an idea that was originally proposed for optical communications @xcite .",
    "more recently , this aspect and its implications have been deeply explored both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite also in the rf domain , leading to significant results @xcite .",
    "a great amount of possibilities exists to generate oam beams at various frequency ranges @xcite ; among these , one of the most suitable for radio transmissions consists in the use of antenna arrays , where the sought - for solutions can be implemented by means of a proper array synthesis technique @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we perform the experimental analysis of an oam - based radio transmission with antenna arrays in the vhf tv band ( @xmath6 mhz ) supported by a preliminary numerical study .",
    "the experiment represents , to the best of our knowledge , the first case of multiple oam transmission / reception of digital video broadcasting - terrestrial ( dvb - t ) signals using a single array of identical radiators on both sides of the communication link , in the far - field region .",
    "one of the main results of the experiment lies in the verification of the feasibility of such transmissions in a real - world context .",
    "moreover , a validation of the `` oam - link pattern '' concept , introduced in @xcite , is provided .",
    "section [ sec_motiv ] concerns the description of the experimental set - up and the motivations behind our choices .",
    "then , section [ sec_oampattern ] resumes the fundamental concept of oam - link pattern , which enables a preliminary estimation of the results expected from measures .",
    "some brief notes on the numerical simulations carried out in order to support the experimental investigation are provided in section [ sec_simul ] .",
    "the technical details on the electronic devices employed for the oam multiplexing / demultiplexing , the tests set - up and the experimental analysis are explained in section [ sec_oamtrans ] .",
    "finally , sections [ sec_experiment ] and [ sec_expres ] report the study and the results relative to the simultaneous transmission of two dvb - t signals encoded as oam @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes , performed with the same experimental apparatus described in the previous part of the work",

    "the motivation behind the choice of working with antenna arrays is dictated by the fact that , although extensively studied in literature both theoretically and numerically @xcite , to the best of our knowledge there are no experimental reports of their usage in oam far - field radio transmissions .",
    "moreover , antenna arrays are better suited to implement a multimode transmission with respect to other oam antennas .",
    "indeed , a single array fed via beamforming network can support the simultaneous transmission of several independent oam modes , in contrast to other antennas like the twisted parabolic reflector @xcite .",
    "in addition , this solution offers the possibility to validate the functionality of specially designed electronic devices conceived as beamforming networks for the oam mutiplexing and demultiplexing in antenna arrays , designed and patented before the experimental analysis @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will refer to such devices as oam `` mode sorters '' .    in order to ensure technical simplicity ,",
    "a minimal number of array elements was considered , allowing to check the oam concept far from the cases treated in literature , where many more elements are usually taken into account .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_gaffo1 ] , the two systems were placed on the two opposite ends of the flat roof of the rai research centre .",
    "the choice of the location for the experiment was essentially motivated by two factors : the height and the arrangement of the building , which permit negligible ground reflection , and the intention to show a true far - field transmission ( a link distance of @xmath7 m corresponds to more than three times the far - field threshold for the case under consideration ) .",
    "the decision of working in the frequency band around @xmath8 mhz , which corresponds to a wavelength @xmath9 m , was dictated by the purpose of a tv transmission and by the need to work in a frequency range where the functionalities of the electronic devices were ensured .",
    "when considering oam transmissions between antenna arrays , a proper phase - weighting must be introduced at the receiver in order to account for the azimuthal phase profile of a vortex wave and lead to a non - null on - axis power transfer response @xcite . to this end , in @xcite , the following formula for the oam - link budget estimation between two facing arrays was obtained : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the modulus of the wave vector , @xmath12 is the vacuum impedance , @xmath13 is the resistance of the radiators , @xmath14 and @xmath15 indicate the number of elements in the transmitting and the receiving array , respectively , while @xmath16 is the feed coefficient associated to the @xmath17th antenna , resulting from the synthesis of an oam mode with index @xmath3 over the considered array layout .",
    "furthermore , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the effective heights for each link of length @xmath20 connecting the @xmath17th transmitting antenna to the @xmath21th receiving one , and vice versa .    in ( [ eq_link2 ] )",
    "only a receiving configuration with @xmath22 allows for a correct reception of the incoming oam beam with azimuthal index @xmath23 . in this case ,",
    "expression ( [ eq_link2 ] ) defines , as a function of the azimuth and elevation angles of one of the two arrays , the oam - link pattern , characterized by an on - axis maximum where the conventional radiation pattern exhibits the central null .    following the approach described in @xcite",
    ", we can evaluate the link budget for a couple of facing ucas made of half - wave dipoles by simply inserting in ( [ eq_link2 ] ) the effective height formula relative to this type of antenna @xcite . in the case of an @xmath24-element uca ,",
    "the synthesis coefficients for the generation of an oam beam with index @xmath3 are simply fixed by requiring the phase difference between each pair of subsequent array elements to be @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the relation that determines how many oam modes such array can support is : @xmath26 .    in order to conform our analysis to the experiment , which will be described in the following , we consider two identical 4-element facing ucas with radius @xmath27 m and separated by a link distance @xmath28 m , as schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_gaffo2 ] .",
    "since the array elements used in the experiment are folded yagi - uda antennas , a simple way to address the problem consists in introducing a correction to the expression ( [ eq_link2 ] ) for the link budget estimation in the case of half - wave dipoles , which correspond to the driven elements of each yagi - uda antenna .",
    "the presence of four parasitic elements in the yagi - uda antennas makes the radiation pattern of the arrays more directive , focusing the emitted radiation along the direction of propagation in transmission and increasing the ability of the receiving array to intercept the incoming beam along the same direction .",
    "this effect can be taken into account by adding to the link budget an amount equal to twice the power gain difference between the yagi - uda antenna and a half - wave dipole . since the considered yagi - uda antennas have a gain of about @xmath29 dbi and the gain of a half - wave dipole",
    "is estimated at @xmath30 dbi , the values obtained with expression ( [ eq_link2 ] ) should be approximately increased by @xmath31 db .    according to these arguments , fig .",
    "[ fig_gaffo3 ] shows the behaviour of ( [ eq_link2 ] ) as a function of the angle @xmath32 relative to the rotation of the receiving array around the @xmath33-axis passing through its center , for the couple of facing yagi - uda antenna arrays . due to the orthogonality between oam modes and",
    "having the emitted beam an azimuthal index @xmath34 , only a rephasing with index @xmath35 maximizes the received signal at @xmath36 , while a destructive configuration occurs whenever @xmath37 .",
    "relative to the receiving array .",
    "the considered arrays are 4-elements ucas made of folded yagi - uda antennas and separated by a distance @xmath28 m. the oam beam transmitted with azimuthal index @xmath34 at a frequency of @xmath8 mhz is received according to two different rephasing configurations.,width=336 ]    .,width=600 ]    for completeness , fig .",
    "[ fig_gaffo4 ] reports the behaviour of formula ( [ eq_link2 ] ) at two fixed angles @xmath32 _ versus _ the link distance between the yagi - uda antenna arrays .",
    "as can be observed , for any value of @xmath32 the curve corresponding to the proper reception of the incoming oam mode ( i.e. the solid green line ) follows the well - known asymptotic behaviour @xmath38 .    for arrays of isotropic radiators ,",
    "the destructive configuration @xmath39 settles to zero at @xmath36 , where the orthogonality of the oam modes is at its maximum , and decreases with distance according to the usual law @xmath38 when @xmath40 . due to the directivity of the considered array elements , this receiving configuration for the system under examination approximates the case of arrays made of isotropic elements only at great distances , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_gaffo4 ] ( dashed red line ) .",
    "the numerical analysis performed to support the experiment was carried out via the rf module of the software comsol multiphysics^^@xcite , which is based on the finite element method ( fem ) and represents a valuable tool , enabling one to take into account the system complexity as well as couplings among antennas . on the other hand",
    ", the analysis needs a complete meshing of the whole space involved in the electromagnetic transmission , so a high computational demand for large systems is required .",
    "a further problem arises from the necessity to introduce the perfectly matched layer ( pml ) , an adsorbing region which mathematically reproduces the effect of the free space outside the volume of interest where the electromagnetic transmission between the antenna arrays takes place .",
    "being the pml absorbing efficiency numerically limited and strongly sensitive to the incidence angle , one has to enlarge the region of interest in order to prevent reflections of tangential rays on the pml walls , that would compromise the evaluation of the model parameters , especially when such quantities are small .",
    "we studied the electromagnetic transmission of oam waves between two identical facing arrays of four yagi - uda antennas , each composed by five parallel thin metal strips and fed by a lumped port on the driven element .",
    "all the involved quantities were set according to the experimental values and the wavelength was fixed at @xmath9 m. the receiving array orientation was parameterized in @xmath32 , which corresponds to the angle of rotation of the array around the @xmath33-axis passing through its center , while a further parameterization was provided by the distance @xmath41 between the transmitting and the receiving systems .",
    "the main goal of our simulation was to compute the oam - link pattern as a function of the variable @xmath32 in terms of a parametric sweep on the total received power , which can be expressed as a suitable combination of post - processed quantities : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the @xmath44th synthesized coefficient for the considered oam mode and @xmath45 represents the corresponding model port voltage , i.e. the open - circuit voltage at the terminals of the @xmath44th antenna .",
    "wave at @xmath7 m , extrapolated from the curve computed at @xmath46 m in order to cope with excessive computational demand.,width=336 ]    as explained before , we have to avoid possible reflections from the pml walls , a problem that is the more severe the smaller the distance between pml and antennas .",
    "further complications lie in the fact that the oam beam divergence angle is larger than in the @xmath47 case and that each reflection is accompanied by a change in sign of the azimuthal index @xmath3 . for these reasons ,",
    "the distance between the pml walls and the antenna arrays should be considerable , introducing a trade - off between precision in the calculated quantities and computational expense . as a matter of fact",
    ", it was verified that , in correspondence with a not enough large transmission volume , the unwanted reflections affect the curves and in particular the red one in which the incoming wave @xmath34 is read in destructive configuration @xmath48 , causing the disappearance of the expected central dip around @xmath36 . on the other hand ,",
    "the meshing of a whole @xmath7 m - length transmission volume , large enough to avoid most of the reflections on the pml walls , would have required an excessive computational capacity to be tolerated by our server machine .",
    "fortunately , beyond a given distance ( which is expected to approximately match the far - field threshold ) the oam - link pattern does not show any significant changes except for a scale factor related to the beam divergence , therefore leading to the possibility of reasonable extrapolations at very high distances .",
    "the application of this useful procedure to our case is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_gaffo5 ] , where the oam - link pattern relative to the transmission of an @xmath34 wave at @xmath7 m is extrapolated from the corresponding pattern computed at @xmath46 m with comsol multiphysics^^according to the far - field decays of the oam beams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_gaffo4 ] .",
    "in order to introduce suitable phase shifts to both the transmitting and the receiving antenna arrays , a proper electronic device , called _ mode sorter _ , was designed with the aim of encoding / decoding up to @xmath49 oam - modes in the case of @xmath24-element ucas @xcite .        although with @xmath50 antennas the @xmath47 mode could be generated too , we chose to limit our investigation to just @xmath51 modes , for simplicity . the prototyped mode sorter , used in the experiment and schematically depicted in fig . [ fig_gaffo6 ] , was realized in order to reproduce the following ideal behaviour : the four outputs , connected to the antennas of the transmitting uca , determine the emission of an oam beam with azimuthal index @xmath34 or @xmath52 , depending on whether the input port * a * or * b * is fed . for symmetry , when the considered mode sorter is used in reception ,",
    "an opposite phase - weighting is introduced over the incident beam ; as a result , the signals read at the output ports * c * and * d * are rephased with an index @xmath53 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "however , due to the technical limitations of the electronics , the outgoing beam can not be intended as a pure oam mode with index @xmath54 , but rather as a linear combination of all the oam modes supported by the considered 4-element uca , with a prevalence of the @xmath34 or the @xmath52 contribution depending on the input port chosen .    with the aim of realizing an experiment of a real tv signal transmission",
    ", a couple of mode sorters working on tv frequencies was implemented ; the reasons of this choice lie in the availability of commercial components covering a whole tv band and in the presence of free channels in the vhf spectrum ( @xmath55 mhz ) .",
    "to design the mode sorters circuit whatever technique can be used . here a specially devised synthesis method that allows to avoid components with more than two ports has been employed .",
    "most phase shifters usually set a severe limit to the bandwidth of the system ; in our case with @xmath50 antennas the synthesis method enables the use of two - port @xmath56 and @xmath57 hybrids , that can be easily found in the wide - band version .",
    "the price to pay is a higher insertion loss than the one achievable by a narrow - band design .",
    "the mode sorters were tested individually in the laboratory . the maximum amplitude unbalance among the four antenna ports",

    "the calibrated measurement result , @xmath71 db , was found to be in good agreement with the classic link budget estimation of @xmath72 db ( friis formula ) .",
    "then , due to the strong sensitivity of the oam orthogonality to misalignment , in a second step it was necessary to ensure that both the arrays were perpendicular to the line connecting their centers . for this purpose , an oam beam with index @xmath34 , characterized by a doughnut - shaped beam profile with a zero on - axis intensity ,",
    "was sent to the receiving array and the voltage signals induced over all its elements were simply summed ( this standard reading corresponds to the @xmath73 receiving configuration ) . by rigidly rotating the receiving structure , it was possible to map the intensity profile of the received beam and to determine the angular position of its minimum , which provides the proper alignment of the arrays , confirmed within a few angular degrees .    finally , since the purpose of the third test was to study the behaviour of the two considered receiving configurations ( i.e. @xmath53 and @xmath48 ) when an oam mode with index @xmath34 is transmitted , a signal @xmath74 provided by the vna was introduced into the input port * a * of the mode sorter connected to the transmitting yagi - uda antennas ( see fig .",

    "the port * b * of the tx mode sorter , corresponding to an @xmath52 mode , was not fed and kept properly terminated .",
    "a significant reception of the beam is expected only when the rephasing configuration is @xmath35 .",
    "the resulting signals @xmath75 and @xmath76 , read at the outputs of the receiving mode sorter , can be expressed in terms of the channel matrix @xmath77 relative to the considered system as follows : @xmath78 the adopted matrix approach describes the whole process in the two - dimensional space relative to the accessible entries and outputs of the mode sorters .",
    "moreover , since the matrix @xmath77 takes into account the action of the mode sorters over the transmitted signal , it can be decomposed in the following product : @xmath79 where the _ pure _ channel matrix @xmath80 is obtained from @xmath77 by removing the unwanted electronic contribution introduced by the electronics .",
    "the mode sorters were expressed in terms of the two - dimensional matrices @xmath81 and @xmath82 , which are one the inverse conjugate of the other , due to their opposite orientation and the oam chirality inversion at the reception .",
    "the reason for choosing bidimensional matrices lies in the possibility to express , within a tolerable margin of error , the four - dimensional transmitting outputs and receiving inputs of the mode sorters in terms of the oam states with indices @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "after the reception experiment , each tv receiver was disconnected and the signal was routed to a keysight mxa ( n9020a ) signal analyzer with dvb - t / t2 analysis option to evaluate the received signal quality .",
    "assuming a correct antenna pointing , both tv receivers proved to simultaneously receive the relevant tv programmes ( fig .",
    "[ fig_gaffo13 ] ) .",
    "however , the experiment was carried out in a quite windy day and the limited mechanic rigidity of the pvc antenna mast did not help to keep optimal and constant aiming .",
    "_ right _ : channel impulse response ( cir ) for the @xmath0 oam channel.,width=480 ]    in presence of noise and/or interference , the digital tv does not exhibit errors on the screen until the snr gets very close to a critical threshold .",
    "hence , the margin in received signal quality can not be estimated from the screen image , but must be evaluated only by instrumental means .",
    "the mxa signal analyzer with dvb - t / t2 option is able to measure several quality parameters of the received signal . in particular",
    ", this instrument can estimate the snr and the mer .. snr and mer have similar meaning , but mer is estimated on the vector space of signals . ] in fig .",
    "[ fig_gaffo14 ] the measured channel impulse response ( cir ) for the @xmath0 oam channel is shown .",
    "the main peak , time = @xmath105 , amptd = @xmath105 db , is related to direct propagation path ; at about @xmath106 ns other components are seen at @xmath107 db level .",
    "this indicates that some propagation paths with about @xmath106 ns delay were present , @xmath108 db below the main signal level ( for @xmath0 ) and gives an idea of the reflecting environment around the experimental site : @xmath106 ns time delay indicates a @xmath67 m path distance difference .    during our observation with mxa ,",
    "the insulation between the oam channels fluctuated roughly from @xmath109 db ( poor aiming ) to @xmath93 db ( good aiming ) due to the wind .",
    "the latter value is in line with the insulation found during the instrumental tests . in correspondence of",
    "strong wind episodes some error could be seen on the tv screen . in that case",
    ", the problem is solved switching to the 16-qam @xmath110 modulation .",
    "moreover , it is important to emphasize that a device with adaptive interference cancellation capability would be able to reduce the inaccuracies caused both by a non - perfect aiming and by the presence of wind , improving the channels insulation .",
    "a numerical and experimental study concerning oam - based transmissions between uniform circular arrays of yagi - uda antennas has been presented .",
    "the novelties of this work lie in the possibility 1 ) to implement a multimode communication at the same frequency and in the far - field region using a _ single _ antenna system ( uca ) at both the transmitting and the receiving site ; 2 ) to perform an efficient transmission considering a minimal number of array elements ; 3 ) to validate the _ oam - link pattern _ concept both numerically and experimentally and ,",
    "lastly , 4 ) to test the functionality of the mode sorters as oam multiplexing and demultiplexing networks in antenna arrays , showing a satisfactory mode insulation and wide - band operation .    while bearing in mind that the well - known power decay of oam beams with respect to the link distance @xmath41 ( i.e. @xmath111 ) represents an unavoidable problem , the main goal of this article was to show the feasibility of the transmission / reception of two digital television ( dvb - t ) signals encoded as oam @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes at the same frequency , over a link distance longer than three times the far - field range .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the achieved oam mode insulation is acceptable for the purposes of our experiment , but a dedicated post - processing cancellation technique would greatly improve the performance in a more general application scenario .",
