    "the gershgorin circles theorem  @xcite ensures that all the eigenvalues of @xmath64 lie within the union of all the gershgorin discs .",
    "specifically , since the rows of @xmath64 sum to zero , if each off - diagonal entry of a row @xmath5 is positive , then @xmath70 and it follows that the @xmath71 gershgorin disc is contained in the left - half complex plane .",

    ", we can identify precisely which oscillators require control . in particular , with the addition of control the jacobian becomes @xmath73 specifically , for each row @xmath5 with negative off - diagonal entries , the control gain can be set to @xmath74 , shifting the @xmath71 gershgorin disc into the left - half complex plane , stabilizing the network .    before proceeding to numerical examples , we make an important remark on the identification of oscillators that require control . in particular",

    "control is turned on at @xmath84 . ]    in addition to the time series of the phases and their angular velocities , we also consider three macroscopic order parameters .",
    "the first represents the mean field of the limit cycle oscillators : @xmath99 we also consider the classical kuramoto order parameter which ignores the oscillators amplitudes : @xmath100 the magnitudes of these complex order parameters , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , thus give meaningful measures of the network synchronization .",
    "finally , as a complement to @xmath103 and @xmath104 , we consider an order parameter designed to quantify the instantaneous frequency dispersion in the network  @xcite : @xmath105 where @xmath106 represents the mean over the population .",
    "we note that , while strong synchronization is typically indicated by larger values of @xmath101 and @xmath102 , small values of @xmath107 indicate small frequency dispersion , and therefore strong synchronization .",
    "we also plot in panels ( c ) of figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] the time series of order parameters @xmath82 ( solid blue curve ) , @xmath83 ( dashed blue curve ) , and @xmath108 ( dot - dashed red curve ) . as is typically the case ( but does not need to be so ) , the kuramoto order parameter @xmath83 is larger than the order parameter @xmath82 due to the fact that @xmath109 for all @xmath5 .",
    "interestingly , type i control enhances the degree of synchronization , as measured by both @xmath82 and @xmath83 , however type ii control actually results in a smaller value of both .",
    "this can be explained by inspecting the distributions of target phases to which the oscillators relax in panels ( a ) .",
    "in particular , type i control results in a distribution of phases that are clustered relatively close to the mean angle ( here shifted to zero ) , while type ii results in a much more uniform distribution of phases around the whole unit circle , resulting in a surprisingly low degree of phase synchronization .",
    "we also observe a large ( and noisy ) degree of frequency dispersion without control , however both type i and type ii control drives the frequency dispersion @xmath108 to a very small value .",
    "( @xmath85 , @xmath77 , @xmath98 ) .",
    "time series of @xmath79 of the phases @xmath80 and their angular velocities @xmath81 are plotted in panels ( a ) and ( b ) , and the order parameters @xmath82 ( solid curve ) and @xmath83 ( dashed curve ) are plotted in panel ( c ) .",
    "control is turned on at @xmath84 . ]    in the examples presented in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] the degree of synchronization of the initial state before control was relatively low , i.e. , a significant number of oscillators were incoherent .",
    "we now contrast these experiments by considering the result of applying control to a state with initiall larger degree of synchronization . for the same network",
    "as used above , we increase the coupling strength to @xmath110 , and present the results of applying both type i and type ii control in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "note that before application of control the network is significantly more synchronized than for the case of @xmath78 . in both cases of type i and type ii control",
    "the network is able to relax to an equilibrium , however we note an interesting phenomenon with the macroscopic order parameters . in the case of type",
    "i control ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , while the order parameter @xmath82 increases , the kuramoto order parameter @xmath83 in fact decreases .",
    "more surprisingly , in the case of type ii control ( fig .  [ fig4 ] ) , both order parameters @xmath82 decrease after control in applied .",
    "we find that this phenomenon can be attributed the the distribution of phases attained after control is applied .",
    "in particular , in both type i and type ii control the distribution of steady - state phases can be relatively wide .",
    "this is more apparent in the case of type ii control , but is also somewhat true for type i control .",
    "[ note that several oscillators in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) relax near @xmath111 .",
    "] thus , while the control method can be used to attain consensus in the sense of frequency synchronization , the resulting state may be poorly phase - synchronized .",
    "this effect is curbed primarily in type i control for the order parameter @xmath112 since oscillators are explicitly driven to a larger amplitude , tending to result in an increased @xmath82 . finally , as in the example with smaller @xmath7 , both type i and type ii control drives the frequency dispersion @xmath108 to a very small value .",
    "before closing , we briefly discuss the possible failures of the control method presented in this paper .",
    "while the method has been by - and - large effective in our explorations , we have also observed some cases where full frequency - synchronization is not attained .",
    "these failures deserve a few remarks .",
    "first , we note that in our explorations type i is very effective , failing very infrequently .",
    "second , failures typically correspond to one or two oscillators remaining incoherent , and thus a very large fraction of the network end up in a state of frequency synchronization .",
    "finally , we note that the likelihood of failure can be mitigated by modifying the threshold parameters @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "we emphasize that the target states @xmath20 which are central to the control method are approximations of theoretical equilibria of eq .",
    "[ eq : landaustuart ] , and thus it is to be expected that as this approximation fails , the likelihood of the control method failing increases .",
    "we find that the effect of these inaccuracies can be curbed by increasing these threshold parameters .",
    "we note that our explorations have focused on the case of er random networks , and the presence of more complicated structural patterns in networks could affect the control method .    on the other hand ,",
    "up to the approximations discussed above , the method presented here guarantees a spectrum of stable eigenvalues by ensuring that the gershgorin circles , which contain the eigenvalues , are contained in the negative real - half of the complex plane .",
    "we note , however , that one or more gershgorin circles partially crossing the imaginary axis into the real - half of the complex plane does not guarantee an unstable eigenvalue , but simply admits the possibility .",
    "thus , it is likely possible that in some cases the synchronized state can be stabilized with less control ( e.g. , smaller control gains @xmath19 ) than suggested here .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the control of networks of limit - cycle oscillators towards full frequency synchronization , i.e. , consensus .",
    "the proposed method represents an extension of a method for controlling networks of phase oscillators  @xcite  now applied to the limit - cycle counterpart given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : landaustuart ] ) .",
    "in particular , the method is based on identifying a target fixed point for the network and stabilizing this target state via an appropriately - defined feedback - type control .",
    "we proposed two types of control : type i control uses only the phase dynamics of the system and drives oscillators to large amplitudes ( i.e. , @xmath115 ) , while type ii control uses both the phase and amplitude dynamics of each oscillator to find a target state .",
    "we have demonstrated the application of both type i and type ii control with numerical examples and studied the effect that each type has on the macroscopic order parameters of the network . surprisingly , the application of control can , and often does , decrease the degree of phase synchronization , as measure by the typical kuramoto order parameter or it limit - cycle oscillator counterpart , while attaining strong frequency synchronization .",
    "we find that this phenomenon is due to the fact that , in many cases , the target state to which control drives the oscillators is relatively widely spread around the unit circle .",
    "finally , we have included a discussion on the possible failures of the method .",
    "as the determination of the target state is based on an approximation , it is expected that as the approximation fails , the likelihood of the control method failing increases .",
    "we note , however , that this effect can be curbed by modifying threshold parameters built into the control identification process , and in cases of failure we find that only one or two oscillators remain desynchronized from the synchronized population .",
    "we believe that the control method discussed in this paper complements other commonly used control methods such as pinning  @xcite and time - delay feedback  @xcite which have in some cases been applied to limit - cycle oscillator dynamics such as those considered here , as well as other types of dynamics .",
    "while the work presented here can can be thought of as a type of feedback control method , we emphasize its novelty and simplicity  stemming from a nonlinear dynamics stability analysis of the target synchronized state .",
    "more broadly , we believe that this work will be more generally useful for the control of nonlinear dynamics on complex networks and serve as inspiration for the development of control methods that combine essential elements from both the nonlinear dynamics of each unit and the structural properties of the network itself",
