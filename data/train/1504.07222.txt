    "since almost a century ago , a huge ammount of evidence has been accumulated through astrophysics observations  @xcite , indicating that the majority of matter in the universe is of unknown origin .",
    "such observations , however , refer specifically to the gravitational response of ordinary ( or baryonic ) matter to this so called dark matter ( dm ) , scarcely showing other properties it should comply with , except that it has to be effectively electrically neutral  , non - baryonic , cosmologically stable and cold at recombination .",
    "these are important clues in order to start building a model to describe the dm .",
    "particle physics is strongly appealing in offering a dm candidate , since many motivating extensions of the standard model of electroweak interactions ( sm ) possess new fields and symmetries , which could suitably provide one ( or more ) stable particle(s ) in their spectrum .",
    "the first observational requirement that a dm model has to fulfill is a a set of interactions that can account for the relic density inferred from the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) .",
    "as it says nothing about the particle nature of the dm candidate , such as its mass , spin or charges , we have to count on the possibility of detecting a signal from a dm particle and gathering more information in order to put this particle under siege .",
    "such a signal should be identified in underground detectors ( direct detection search ) , in sattelites or ground - based telescopes ( indirect detection search ) as well as in colliders or accelerators ( collider search ) .",
    "there are many experiments searching for dm candidates , especially the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "currently , no unambiguous positive dm signal was announced by the experiments , but limits were put on its scattering cross - section off nucleon and production rate .    any viable particle physics model that addresses the dm issue must comply with these bounds and may be constructed in an top - down or a bottom - up way .",
    "the top - down models intend to explain open particle physics problems in a fundamental way while having a dm candidate , such as supersymmetric and extra - dimension models .",
    "the bottom - up models intend to minimally explain the dm physics , with just a few free parameters and strong predictions , and are more easily ruled out by the experiments .",
    "this strategy , that we will adopt here , allows us to identify what initial hypothesis can be modified in order to agree with the experimental limits .",
    "models in which the interaction between dm and standard particles is realized through scalar exchanges , the higgs portal , are phenomenologically interesting since the discovery of the higgs - like scalar at the lhc  @xcite . as its couplings and branching ratios are being measured , the higgs physics can constrain the parameter space of such dm models . here , we focus on the fermionic dm in a minimal higgs portal model .",
    "fermionic dm particles may be majorana or dirac particles , differing in their relic abundance which is twice larger for dirac fermions , to account for the fact there are two distinct particles annihilating  @xcite . also , the scattering cross - section off nucleon of a majorana fermion is twice larger relative to a dirac fermion  @xcite . in many respects",
    "there is no significant difference between dirac and majorana fermion dm candidates though , as pointed out in previous works  @xcite .",
    "singlet dirac dm candidates were vastly explored in the context of higgs portal models after the higgs discovery  @xcite .",
    "it is known that a lighter than 100  gev dirac dm is excluded by relic , direct detection and collider constraints , except at the resonance region  @xcite .",
    "although less considered , a majorana dm in renormalizable higgs portal models were also pointed out as viable dm candidates  @xcite .    the effective field theory",
    "( eft ) approach of the majorana fermion dm was considered in  @xcite . within eft approach ,",
    "the fermionic dm higgs portal cp - conserving scenario is excluded by direct detection search for the 60  gev - 2  tev dm mass range .",
    "nevertheless , it remains viable if we consider uv completions such as a resonant or an indirect higgs portal  @xcite . since we do not know the mass scales of the possible intermediate particles , we can not know if an eft approach is valid in the context of higgs portal dm models . indeed , even though renormalizable models must agree with eft models in the limit of heavy mediators , some degrees of freedom concerning the mediator phenomenology are only appreciable in concrete models",
    ". the limitations of the eft approach to higgs portal dm models , concerning the lhc and lux constraints  @xcite , were considered in refs .",
    "also , the implications of the 125gev scalar for higgs portal dm models were studied in a model independent way in ref .",
    "@xcite , considering generic scalar , majorana fermion and vector dm candidates .",
    "they found that a non - renormalizable majorana fermion dm is excluded by xenon100 , if the higgs - dm coupling strength is larger than @xmath1 .",
    "in this work , we consider a sterile majorana neutral fermion as dm candidate in a renormalizable cp - conserving higgs portal model  @xcite , under the light of the recent experimental limits .",
    "we suppose the existence of a discrete @xmath0 symmetry responsible for the majorana fermion stability , that is expected as a remnant of some spontaneously broken gauge symmetry at a high scale not relevant for the low energy physics .",
    "the mediator between the majorana fermion and the standard particles is a complex singlet scalar that develops a nonzero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , thus breaking lepton number symmetry .",
    "this work is the first consideration of the lux impact on the parameter space of a concrete majorana dm higgs portal model .",
    "we also consider the xenon1 t prospect bound  @xcite , the invisible higgs decay constraint and comment how the extension of the scalar sector alters the higgs self - couplings , showing that its future measurement will put important bounds on our parameter space .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in the next section we will present our model . in section  [ s3 ]",
    "we compute the relic density and scattering cross section off nucleon for the majorana fermion , in order to constrain our parameter space and discuss how the free parameters influence this observables .",
    "we also comment the impact of the future measurements of the higgs self - couplings on the free parameters and the possibility of having a dark radiation candidate in our scenario .",
    "our main results are presented in section  [ s4 ] , where we update the parameter space taking into account the invisible higgs decay , the lux and the xenon1 t bounds , considering separately the scalar extension and the mass spectrum parts .",
    "finally , in section  [ s5 ] we give our conclusions .",
    "the model we consider here consists of a singlet majorana right - handed neutral fermion , @xmath2 , as a dm candidate , whose interaction with the sm particles is through the higgs portal by including a singlet scalar in the model , @xmath3 , which mix to the sm higgs doublet , @xmath4 .",
    "this majorana fermion is sterile and stable , a requisite for a dm candidate , when non - trivially transforming under a @xmath0 symmetry , which forbids it to mix to the light neutrinos and makes it interact only with the singlet scalar field .",
    "we built our lagrangian assuming lepton number conservation .",
    "considering that @xmath2 carries one unit of lepton number , no explicit mass term for it is present in the lagrangian .",
    "its mass is generated from an yukawa term involving the @xmath0-even singlet bilepton , @xmath3 , when it acquires a nonzero vev and break the lepton number symmetry .",
    "this assumptions reduce the number of free parameters in our model , in comparison with the majorana fermion models we referenced .",
    "the most general renormalizable lagrangian to be added to the sm , under the above assumptions , is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the kinetic term for the new singlet fields and the scalar potential is @xmath7    after spontaneous breaking of electroweak and lepton number symmetries , when @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the above potential leads to the minimum conditions : @xmath10 and @xmath11 the physical spectrum is then obtained by shifting the scalar fields to the physical fields , that can be written in the unitary gauge as , @xmath12 and @xmath13    observe that the breaking of lepton number symmetry implies the existence of a majoron in the spectrum , @xmath14 , which was shown to be a phenomenologically safe goldstone boson  @xcite .",
    "the mass matrix of the massive scalar fields is given by @xmath15 after diagonalization , we have the physical states @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the cosine and sine of the mixing angle @xmath19 , determined by @xmath20    since the discovery of a scalar resonance in the cms and atlas experiments at lhc  @xcite , with mass @xmath21  gev , and whose interactions indicate it is most probably the sm higgs boson , we can be sure that this scalar can not be a singlet under @xmath22 . in our case , it has to come from the doublet - like scalar , @xmath23 , implying that the mixing angle in eq .",
    "( [ mix ] ) has to be small .",
    "this is further corroborated by the null search results for a lighter than 125  gev scalar , once the coupling of sm fields and the scalar singlet are suppressed by @xmath18 .",
    "we then identify the mass eigenstates by @xmath24 for the higgs scalar and @xmath25 for the singlet scalar .    in terms of the mass eigenvalues ,",

    "an important feature of this higgs portal model is that the ongoing characterization of the discovered higgs boson can provide valuable constraints on the free parameters .",

    "as the dark matter in our scenario interacts just by scalar exchanges , a characteristic behavior of the relic density is one sharply peaked region at @xmath59  gev , corresponding to the higgs production and depending on the scalar mixture , and another one at @xmath60 , corresponding to the singlet scalar production . as an asymptotic behavior ,",

    ", we can have a majorana fermion as a dm candidate for masses from 30  gev to 2  tev .",
    "the resonance due to the higgs exchange , at @xmath63  gev , is clear in these plots , but if it is going to reach the observed relic density depends mainly on the mixing angle value .",

    "[ vev ] , we see that there is a global increase in the relic density according to the increase of @xmath65 , due mainly to the interaction of the majorana fermion with h , s and j , which is inversely proportional to @xmath65 . in view of this , we have an upper and a lower allowed scale for the global symmetry breaking to occur in this dm scenario .",
    "the plots in figure  [ vev ] comprehend all the @xmath64 values , then all the singlet scalar resonances .",
    "as we are taking singlet scalars up to 2  tev , the resonances due to their productions go up to 1  tev .",

    "so , the scattering cross section is always spin - independent ( si ) and is given by @xmath66    the scattering amplitude is the sum of each scalar contribution : @xmath67 where we have taken the low energy limit in which the masses of the virtual particles are much greater than their momenta .",
    "this minus sign comes from the diagonalization of the scalar mass eigenstates ( eq .  [ mix ] ) .",
    "we present a scatter plot for the scattering cross section off nucleon in figure  [ sigmamsig ] , that shows the well known interference effect in the amplitude near the higgs mass value , as can be expected from eq .",
    "[ amplitude ] .",
    "this is why the case of @xmath68125  gev evades the lux constraint , as well as the future xenon 1 t constraint , for all the free parameter values considered .",
    "we also see the enhancement of the scattering cross section provided by low scalar masses .        in figure  [ msigfixed ]",
    "we show some plots that clarify the effects of the singlet scalar mass on the wimp - nucleon scattering cross section , taking into account the points that are excluded by the lux results ( red ) , and the points within the planck interval ( gree ) for the relic density , as well as the xenon1 t exclusion prospect ( dark red ) .",
    "although there exist the possibility of a lighter than higgs singlet scalar in this model  @xcite , this case is quite ruled out by lux in our dm scenario , as we can see in figure  [ msigfixed ] ( left ) .",
    "henceforth , we will focus on the case of a singlet scalar heavier than the higgs boson .",
    "as we have already remarked , the case in which the scalars are quite degenerate leads to a cancellation effect in the scattering amplitude , evading the lux constraint and even the xenon1 t future constraint ( figure  [ msigfixed ] , middle ) . notice that xenon1 t will be restrictive even for a tev scale singlet scalar ( figure  [ msigfixed ] , right ) .",
    "the inviability of very light singlet scalars in this model has an interesting consequence .",
    "as we have seen , there exists in our spectrum a majoron , j , that is a massless pseudoscalar .",
    "cosmologically , this particle will naturally contribute to the radiation energy density as long as its interactions make it decouple from the thermal bath . as there are evidences for an unknown contribution for the relativistic degrees of freedom at recombination , the so called dark radiation , we have checked the possibility of j address this question in our dark matter scenario .",
    "the majoron can be a radiation at the recombination epoch if it decouples just before the muon annihilation  @xcite and in that case , roughly speaking , we must have @xmath69    as we are taking only perturbative mixing coupling values , @xmath70 and so @xmath71  gev . as we can infer from figure  [ sigmamsig ] , this possibility is quite excluded by direct detection bounds .",
    "finally , in figure  [ anglecross ] we see that we can evade the direct detection bounds for a small enough mixing angle ( left ) , as the interacion of the majorana fermion with the standard particles is drove by a higgs portal .",
    "this was also observed in ref .",
    "again , in the scalar degenerate case , when @xmath72  gev , we can also evade the direct detection bounds , but the xenon1 t future results should constrain strongly this case as well . in these plots ,",
    "such a scenario has planck - allowed points at @xmath73  tev .",
    "all this analysis is a fair update concerning the issue of dm relic density and direct detection .",
    "once we have a lot of information since the higgs boson discovery we can use it to further improve our results on the parameter space siege for this model , the so called collider complementarity .",
    "we perform this task in the following section .            in summary ,",
    "we have restricted our parameter space by considering only coupling constants within the perturbative regime and ensuring a potential bounded from below .",
    "we have considered mixing angles compatible with the maximum mixing allowed for the discovered higgs boson and examined the impact of the future measurements of the higgs self - couplings on our model .",
    "the values for @xmath65 were limited from thousands of gev to few tev in order to furnish the observed relic density and we have seen that our model is not capable of explaining the existence of a very light singlet scalar if we consider it related to the dark matter physics , through the direct detection bounds .",
    "now , we are ready to look for viable regions of our parameter space taking the experimental bounds in a complementary way .",

    "the new decay rates are given by :    * @xmath74 * @xmath75 * @xmath76    considering the higgs decay rate in sm as @xmath77  mev  @xcite , the upper bound on the branching ratio for the invisible higgs decay ( ihd )  @xcite is @xmath78 and give us the following constraint on our free parameters :    @xmath79    as we focus in the heavier than higgs singlet scalar case , there are only two possible hierarchies : @xmath80 and @xmath81 . for @xmath82",

    "now we study the allowed parameter space for fixed values of @xmath86 and @xmath64 .",
    "here we consider the lepton number breaking scale , @xmath65 , in a larger window , from 100  gev to 10  tev .",
    "the tev scale is a natural scale in the search for new physics , so we study separately the case of @xmath107  tev and @xmath108  tev . for a @xmath107  tev",
    ", we show how the allowed region depends on @xmath64 by fixing it at 130  gev ( quite degenerate case ) , 500  gev ( intermadiate case ) and 1  tev ( tev scale physics ) . on the other hand , for @xmath108  tev",

    ". the majorana fermion will be sufficiently abundant only if the lepton number symmetry breaking is near 2  tev , regardless the singlet scalar mass , implying that its interaction with the scalars would be weak ( see eq .",
    "lower breaking scales would need another dm candidate or a non - thermal dm production , to be constrained by ihd , lux and xenon1 t . as we already pointed out , the quite degenerate case ( left upper panel ) can evade direct detection and as we may expect , the lhc provides the strongest current bound , but can not constrain the scalar mixing of the higgs with a scalar that develops vev too early , at tev scale .",
    "the xenon1 t will allow scalar mixings up to 0.4 in that case .",
    "for heavier singlet scalars , the current limits for the mixing are @xmath110 for @xmath111  gev ( right upper panel ) and @xmath112 for @xmath108  tev ( middle panel ) .",
    "the xenon1 t future limits will restrict much more the mixture , up to @xmath113 , in which case non - standard interactions will not be detected easily .    in the lower panel",
    ", we can appreciate how the scalar resonance regions of the spectrum evade the current experimental bounds . at left ,",
    "we show the higgs resonance case ( @xmath114  gev ) , where the lhc bound is stronger than lux bound but can not constraint a sufficiently abundant majorana fermion . in this case",
    ", the breaking scale should be from 200  gev ( for small mixings ) to 5  tev ( for maximal mixing ) .",
    "nevertheless , if no signal is confirmed by xenon1 t , this case will be completely excluded in the next few years . at right ,",
    "we show the singlet scalar resonance ( @xmath115  gev ) , also not constrained by the current bounds but accessible to xenon1 t , when the mixing will be restricted to @xmath116 .",
    "this possibility requires the breaking scale near 5  tev for a sufficiently abundant majorana fermion .",
    "we have seen that even the safer resonance regions will be strongly constrained in the near future , and even considering a tev scale new physics .",
    "in this work , we updated the majorana fermion dm in a cp - conserving higgs portal scenario , in view of the lux , xenon1 t and the invisible higgs decay ( ihd ) recent results .",
    "our dark matter candidate is a sterile neutral majorana fermion and the higgs portal is opened by a complex scalar field , singlet and neutral under the standard symmetries and charges .",
    "this singlet scalar develops spontaneously a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) that gives a majorana mass for the fermion and leaves it stable due to the discrete @xmath0 symmetry we are supposing , making it a dm candidate .",
    "this model is described by only four parameters : the majorana fermion and singlet scalar masses , @xmath86 and @xmath64 , the mixing angle between the scalars , @xmath19 , and the lepton number breaking scale , @xmath65 .",
    "our parameter space is within the sensibility region of the future collider searches in what concerns to the 3-higgs self - coupling constant .",
    "it means that the measurement of the higgs self - coupling can shade light on our majorana fermion dm scenario .",
    "also , strong deviations from the sm value of the 4-higgs self - coupling will give us information about the scalar mass hierarchy .",
    "all the analysis we have made is within the perturbative regime and is compatible with a bounded from below scalar potential .",
    "we found that @xmath65 must be between few hundreds of gev and few tev in order to the majorana fermion account for the total amount of dm in the universe , according to the planck results .",
    "considering that this symmetry breaking took place at some scale between 100 - 2000gev , the singlet scalar mass from 0.1 - 2000gev and a mixing angle ensuring @xmath62 , we can have a majorana fermion as a dm candidate for masses from 30gev to 2tev .",
    "the case of a lighter than higgs singlet scalar in this dm scenario is quite ruled out by lux , making inviable to consider the majoron as dark radiation .    with the aim of `` split the degeneracy '' of this allowed region , we studied the role of each parameter to find the very predictive curves allowed by planck and contrasted by the experimental limits .",
    "we did it systematically by choosing benchmark values for the free parameters in two steps .",
    "firstly we examined the scalar extension parametrization , by fixing @xmath19 at 0.01 , 0.2 and 0.5 and @xmath65 at 500gev , 1tev and 2tev . secondly , we examined the mass spectrum , by fixing @xmath86 at 60gev , 500gev and 1tev and @xmath64 at 130gev , 500gev and 1tev .",
    "as expected , the allowed regions are near the scalar resonances .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to evade the lux and even the xenon1 t constraint for a majorana dm candidate in two situations : scalar degenerate case ( fig .",
    "[ msigfixed ] ) and small mixing angles ( fig .",
    "[ anglecross ] ) .",
    "the case of a relatively low breaking scale ( @xmath117  500gev ) was found totally excluded by ihd even for a mixing angle of only 0.2 and tev scale @xmath65 values were found safe ( fig .",
    "[ mnmsig ] ) .",
    "we have shown that @xmath118  gev is excluded by lux if @xmath119  gev in essentially two situations : `` @xmath95  tev,@xmath93 '' and `` @xmath120  tev,@xmath92 '' ( right upper and lower of fig .",
    "[ mnmsig ] , respectively ) .    for @xmath107  tev , @xmath65 must be at approximately 2  tev in order to agree with the planck results and the mixing was found restricted to @xmath110 ( for @xmath111  gev ) and @xmath112 ( for @xmath108  tev ) by the lux results and to @xmath113 by the xenon1 t future bound ( upper and middle panels of fig .  [ alfavs ] ) .",
    "it means that if no signal is confirmed by xenon1 t , it becomes very difficult to detect some non - standard interaction at colliders , since they should be proportional to @xmath121 .",
    "the resonance regions were found not constrained by the current experiments , but xenon1 t will exclude completely @xmath122  gev and restrict the mixing to @xmath123 for @xmath108  tev ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ alfavs ] ) .",
    "we have seen how the discoveries of a dm and a new scalar particles are strongly related in our higgs portal scenario .",
    "while this minimal scheme remains allowed by the experimental bounds , it can be embedded in more fundamental extensions of the sm . in supersymmetric theories ,",
    "stable neutralinos are majorana fermions that also appear as natural dark matter candidates and in some gauge extensions and neutral scalars may be the remnants of a more fundamental gauge symmetry breaking , as studied in  @xcite . +",
