    "consider a spin 1/2 uncharged particle with its motion confined to the @xmath0-axis only , driven by the hamiltoninan : @xmath1 it consists of a kinetic term , a potential term that we assume is short range which interacts differently with the spin up and the spin down components of the wavefuntion and the interaction with a constant external magnetic field that points in the @xmath2-direction @xmath3 ; @xmath4 is the particle dipole magnetic moment , @xmath5 is the @xmath2 pauli matrix and @xmath6 is the @xmath7 identity matrix .",
    "the time independent schdinger equation for such a system reads , in terms of the spin up @xmath8 and the spin down @xmath9 components of the wavefunction , @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the total energy of the system . by adding and subtracting these equations",
    "one finds , @xmath13 @xmath14 with , @xmath15 where the @xmath16 and @xmath17 combinations are the components in the basis of eigenvectors of @xmath5 , which diagonalize the magnetic part of the interaction and define the spin zeeman states of the particle , with magnetic energies @xmath18 .",
    "the different _ channels _ are defined by specifying these zeeman states .",
    "a channel is said to be _ open _ or _ closed _ depending on the sign of the combination @xmath19 in the r.h.s of ( [ sch2 ] ) , positive or negative , respectively . as we shall see , it is crucial that the magnetic energy of the two zeeman components have opposite signs .",
    "this asymetry allows the possibility of having simultaneously one open and one closed channel .",
    "we can think of the coupling interaction term @xmath20 as a perturbation that modifies the two _ bare _ decoupled equations , one for each of the components .",
    "it is said that the _ bare _ equations are _ dressed _ by the coupling @xmath20 .    in a scattering experiment , with an incident beam of pure @xmath21 component in a remote zone far from the region where the potential acts , the @xmath21 channel is open and its incident kinetic energy @xmath22 corresponds to the combination @xmath23 , which can be fixed experimentaly .",
    "this in turn fixes the r.h.s .",
    "of the second equation too , @xmath24 , whose sign can be changed by conveniently tunning the magnitude of the external field @xmath25 .",
    "finally , notice that the eqs .",
    "( [ sch2 ] ) do not decouple unless @xmath26 .",
    "we consider _ attractive _ delta - type potentials @xmath27 and @xmath28 , with @xmath29 , where both @xmath30 and @xmath31 are taken positive .",
    "one can think of it as a mathematical effective substitute that describes the low energy scattering off a pottential which only acts in a small region , much smaller than the wavelength of the scattered particle @xcite .    in terms of the combinations , @xmath32 equations in ( [ sch2 ] )",
    "can be written as , @xmath33 where , @xmath34 beeing @xmath35 , @xmath36 the values of the wavefunction components at @xmath37 , the only place where the potential acts .",
    "there are various possibilities that combine different signs of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "of special interest to us is the case with one open channel , coupled to the other channel closed ; the first has @xmath40 , whereas the second has @xmath41 .",
    "we set @xmath42 , with @xmath43 real and positive .",
    "the scattering solution , with the usual incoming wave @xmath44 at the open channel entrance plus outgoing scattered waves , may be written as ( see appendix ) , @xmath45 \\ ; e^{ik|z| } , \\label{sol1u}\\ ] ] and for the closed channel , @xmath46\\ ; e^{-\\beta ' |z|}. \\label{sol1}\\ ] ] the _ sources _ in the r.h.s . of ( [ sol1 ] )",
    "are proportional to the values that the wavefunction components @xmath35 , @xmath36 take at the origin , which can be obtained self - consistently from ( [ sol1 ] ) by setting @xmath37 and solving the resulting linear system .",
    "we obtain , @xmath47 and from the first equation in ( [ sol1 ] ) , @xmath48 where we have defined , @xmath49    equations ( [ u ] ) and ( [ alpha.eq ] ) summarize the remarkable result that we wish to emphasize : the net result of the two coupled channels , with one channel open and the other one closed , is equivalent to a single channel one - dimensional scattering problem with wavenumber @xmath50 and an effective delta - type potential given by ( see appendix ) , @xmath51 that depends on @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , for fixed @xmath50 any value in the whole range , @xmath53 , is available for the effective coupling by varying @xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "this effect disappears completely if @xmath54 , in which case the equations in ( [ sch2 ] ) are not coupled anymore .",
    "we find , @xmath55 and the complete solution ( [ sol1 ] ) reads , @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the reflection and the transmission amplitudes , respectively .",
    "for the other component , @xmath59 there is a value @xmath60 which makes the effective coupling vanish , @xmath61 , @xmath62 where the net effective interaction in the open channel disappears and @xmath63 .",
    "the wave function becomes , @xmath64 with a persisting presence in the closed channel in spite of @xmath65 being zero .",
    "moreover , @xmath66 has a pole at , @xmath67 where it diverges , which leads to total reflection for any value of @xmath50 , @xmath68 , with no transmission whatsoever .",
    "this is the feshbach resonant solution .",
    "its wavefunction is , @xmath69 i.e. , @xmath70 and , @xmath71 notice that @xmath72 coincides precisely with the bound state value ( see ( [ quantization ] ) in the appendix ) in the _ bare _ closed @xmath73-channel .",
    "it is worth stressing once more that across these two values of @xmath43 , @xmath60 and @xmath72 , the effective coupling @xmath74 changes sign , i.e. , the character of the interaction changes from attractive to repulsive .    the reflection coefficient ( which in one dimension plays an analogous role to that of the cross section in three dimensions ) , @xmath75 has its peak at @xmath76 with a width equal to @xmath77 , and is insensitive to the sign of @xmath78 . as we approach the feshbach point @xmath79",
    ", @xmath78 diverges , the reflection coefficient broadens up , and it becomes flat and equal to unity at the pole .",
    "let us complete the discussion with a comment on the partial wave phase shifts . in one dimension and for potentials that are even functions of @xmath0 , two phase shifts @xmath80 , @xmath81 encode all the information concerning scattering , one for each sector of even and odd functions , respectively .",
    "they relate to the reflection and transmission amplitudes by the expressions @xcite , @xmath82 from ( [ sol2 ] ) we find , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "shift is associated to the odd part of the wave function . in this case , the @xmath85 part of the incoming wave in ( [ u ] ) vanishes at @xmath37 , which is the only place it feels the delta - type potential .",
    "therefore , the odd part does not suffer any interaction and its corresponding phase shift @xmath81 vanishes .",
    "] at the feshbach resonance point we find @xmath86 , i.e. , @xmath87 . at @xmath60 , @xmath88 , i.e. , @xmath89 , according to the noninteracting situation .    for the value of @xmath72 our example features the so called feshbach resonance effect @xcite , @xcite ( see @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for some recent reviews ) .",
    "the incoming state of the particle in the open @xmath21-channel is coupled by the interaction @xmath20 in ( [ sch2 ] ) to the bound state @xmath90 , hold in the _ bare _ @xmath73-closed channel .",
    "this colliding @xmath21-beam can thus make a virtual transition to @xmath90 , the duration of which scales as @xmath91 , as the inverse of the detunning @xmath92 , i.e. , the difference between the incident energy in ( [ sch2 ] ) @xmath93 and the magnetically shifted energy of the bound state @xmath94 .",
    "when the magnetic field is such that the denominator @xmath92 is close to zero , the virtual transition can last a very long time and this enhances the scattering amplitude @xcite .",
    "therefore , when the channels are coupled the total scattering amplitude can be viewed as the sum of a direct one , of the incident @xmath21-beam scattering off the potential @xmath95 in ( [ sch2 ] ) , and an indirect one just explained above , due to the possibility of virtually flippling the @xmath21 component to @xmath73 , provided by the coupling @xmath20 .",
    "the amplitudes interfere and give rise to an effect which is constructive and enormously enhanced when the magnetic field is such that @xmath96 ( feshbach resonance ) and destructive for the value at @xmath97 .",
    "the full spectrum covers possibilities other than the one we have analysed .",
    "both channels can be open , in which case the effective coupling in is no longer real ; it is not difficult to repeat the calculations that led to ( [ alpha.eq ] ) and find that it is the continuation of the function in ( [ alpha.eq ] ) to complex arguments , @xmath98 , what appears here , in the situation of boundary conditions of a plane wave entering the @xmath21-channel .",
    "the physical interpretation is clear and reflects the fact that a fraction of the probability at the entrance leaks through the other channel , which is also open .",
    "as can be easily checked , the probability currents @xmath99 and @xmath100 are not separately conserved in the stationary state , but so is the sum of the two @xmath101 that involves the two components at once , @xmath102 which expresses the conservation of the total probability current .    in our case of open @xmath21-channel and closed @xmath73-channel , the wavefunction @xmath103 in ( [ sol1 ] ) is real and its corresponding probability current @xmath104 vanishes , which prevents any probability leakage .",
    "it is the reason why @xmath105 is real and why the probability conservation can be cast in terms of the @xmath99 alone .",
    "finally , let us briefly mention the possibility of discrete bound states for a given value of the magnetic field @xmath25 , i.e. , states with both @xmath106 negative .",
    "they are the solutions of , @xmath107 with @xmath108 and @xmath109 in ( [ ks ] ) , and @xmath110 . with @xmath111 , the number of solutions is either two or just one , depending on whether the value of @xmath112 is smaller or larger than @xmath113 , respectively ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . in the limit of @xmath114 ,",
    "the intesect of the hyperbola and the curve @xmath74 takes place for @xmath115 , in the region where @xmath116 is asymptotically flat and the solution becomes , @xmath117",
    "we have presented a simple example in one dimension which consists of a spin 1/2 particle submitted to a delta - type potential that interatcs with different strength with the spin up and spin down components of the wavefuntion , and with an external magnetic field in the @xmath2-direction .",
    "two coupled channels for scattering are available .",
    "we have checked that in the case of one open and one closed channels , with a suitable choice of the magnetic field a feshbach resonance is produced so that in the neighbourhood of it the effective coupling flips sign , from attractive to repulsive .",
    "the reflection ceofficient is enormalously enhanced around it for all values of the incident wavenumber @xmath50 , and the scattering phase shift is @xmath118 .",
    "all the solutions presented in this article can be easily checked .",
    "we have essentially used the following two facts @xcite , namely , @xmath119    let us briefly review the spectrum of a one - dimensional hamiltonian with an atractive delta - type potential : @xmath120 for @xmath121 it becomes , @xmath122 where @xmath123 , and @xmath124",
    ". with scattering boundary condition of an entering plane wave plus an outgoing scattered wave , the solution , according to ( [ green ] ) is of the form , @xmath125 where , self - consistently , one finds , @xmath126 , i.e. , @xmath127 the reflection and transmission amplitudes @xmath128 , @xmath129 defined as , @xmath130 @xmath131 can be read off immediately , @xmath132    if @xmath133 this potential always holds only one bound state .",
    "( [ 1delta ] ) becomes , with @xmath134 , @xmath135 and according to ( [ green ] ) , @xmath136 setting @xmath37 one is led to conclude that @xmath137 which is the quantization condition for the bound state energy @xmath138 , whereas @xmath139 remains free for normalization of the wave function : @xmath140 the wave function of the bound state extends over a distance @xmath141 around @xmath37 .",
