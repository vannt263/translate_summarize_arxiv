    "the soft x - ray band below 2  kev has been covered by all recent x - ray imaging satellites . the energy band is rich in spectral features ( absorption , emission lines , excess soft x - ray emission and so on ) , which are useful diagnostic tools for understanding the nature of an x - ray source of interest .",
    "it is therefore important that the spectra are clearly understood and that data from different satellites are calibrated reasonably well with each other so that results are independent of the instrument used .",
    "it has been noticed that there are sometimes significant discrepancies between spectral measurements taken with rosat and asca ( e.g. , yaqoob et al 1994 ; allen & fabian 1997 ; ptak 1997 ) . typically , for agn , steeper spectral slopes are obtained from rosat pspc measurements than from asca .",
    "the steep rosat spectral slopes have sometimes been interpreted as due to excess soft x - ray emission , when compared with measurements from hard x - ray experiments ( e.g. , exosat me , ginga lac , and asca ) .",
    "however , similar discrepancies have been found in quasar spectra between the pspc and the einstein observatory ipc ( fiore et al 1994 ; laor et al 1994 ; ciliegi & maccacaro 1996 ) . as the bandpass of the two detectors largely overlaps ,",
    "calibration errors have been suspected ( fiore et al 1994 ) .",
    "we aim in this paper to address the present status of the discrepancy between the asca sis and rosat pspc , using data from the bright seyfert galaxy ngc5548 for which there was simultaneous coverage with both satellites . although the soft x - ray spectrum of ngc5548 is not ideal for calibration because of complexity due to a warm absorber and excess soft x - ray emission , the high spectral resolution of the asca sis is capable of resolving these features .",
    "since the observation was carried out before any significant degradation of the sis detector had occurred , the sis spectrum has good spectral resolution .",
    "there are several other simultaneous asca / rosat observations of agn , but strong absorption or more complex soft x - ray spectra of these targets ( e.g. , iras183255926 , iwasawa et al 1996 ) make cross - calibration difficult . c. otani ( priv .",
    "comm . ) finds a similar discrepancy from the simultaneous asca / rosat observations of mr2251178 to that reported here .",
    "ngc5548 is stable and bright in the soft x - ray band where both the asca sis and rosat pspc are sensitive ; it has also been well studied ( nandra et al 1993 ; done et al 1995 ; reynolds 1997 ; george et al 1998 ) .",
    "preliminary results from efforts of cross - calibration between asca and other satellites , e.g. , bepposax and rxte , are now available and the consistency between them is discussed .    in section 2 ,",
    "we give detailed information on the data reduction . in section 3 ,",
    "we describe the integrated asca spectrum from the whole observation .",
    "the rosat pspc data are presented in section 4 .",
    "the simultaneous data are described in section 5 , where we also examine the consistency of the two datasets .",
    "the results and their implication are discussed in section 6 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     the period over which both asca and rosat observed ngc5548 were simultaneous for about 3 ks .",
    "this is a large fraction of the total pspc observation , during which no flux change is observed .",
    "the spectral data for the 3 ks is virtually identical to the total 4 ks spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "the asca data of the simultaneous observation is a small fraction ( @xmath2 ) of the total exposure . the asca 0.52 kev flux during this period is @xmath3 , @xmath4 10 per cent higher than the mean value for the whole observation .",
    "the spectrum can be different from the averaged one if not dramatically .",
    "we therefore analyze the asca spectrum and then compare it with the pspc spectrum to illuminate any discrepancy in spectral measurement between the two satellites .",
    "since the spectrum below 4 kev is not affected by reflection , as discussed in section 3 , a simple power - law modified by the galactic absorption and a warm absorber was fitted to the asca sis 0.44 kev data .",
    "results of the spectral fit are given in table 5 .",
    "the best - fit value of photon - index is slightly larger than that for the whole dataset , but consistent within uncertainties .",
    "two absorption edges are significantly detected and are identified with ovii and oviii .    in comparing the rosat pspc and the asca sis , we plot the ratio of the data from both detectors to the best - fit model to the asca 0.44 kev spectrum given in table 5 ( fig .",
    "the sis normalization has been adjusted to match that of the gis , being in favour of the absolute flux calibration in the gis ( see section 3 ) .",
    "the significantly better spectral resolution of the asca sis compared to the pspc should provide a better description of the observed spectrum of the source .",
    "the deviation of the pspc data from the asca data is clear .",
    "if both detectors are well calibrated with each other , the pspc data would lie around the ratio of unity , at least in the common 0.52 kev band .",
    "a steep slope of the pspc spectrum is however evident in the energy band .",
    "the inclusion of any extra soft x - ray component below 0.4 kev ( e.g. , a steep power - law or blackbody emission ) in addition to the asca best - fit model fails to provide an acceptable fit to the pspc data ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this rules out the possibility that the excess seen in fig .",
    "7 can be due to the energy response of the pspc when there is a strong soft excess below the asca energy range . even if the double power - law ( see section 3 ) is used for the continuum model , the diecrepancy in ratio in fig .",
    "7 is reduced no more than 15 per cent .",
    "the 0.52 kev fluxes for the simultaneous data from the two instruments are @xmath6  from the pspc and @xmath3  from the sis . as mentioned in section 3",
    ", the asca sis flux could be @xmath7 per cent larger than the quoted value , and thus becomes consistent with the rosat flux if the gis normalization is trusted .",
    "we now examine possible reasons for the discrepancy between rosat and asca in spectral measurements .",
    "steep rosat spectra have been noticed in several analysis on agn spectra by comparing einstein observatory ipc ( fiore et al 1994 ; laor et al 1994 ; ciliege & maccacaro 1996 ) , exosat me ( shartel et al 1997 ) , or bepposax lecs ( mineo et al 1999 ) measurements . as mentioned in the introduction , a similar discrepancy to the present result",
    "was reported from the asca / rosat simultaneous observation of the quasar mr2251178 ( c. otani , priv . comm . ) , suggesting that the result presented in this paper is typical .",
    "since the rosat bandpass ( 0.12.4 kev ) extends to lower energies than the ipc ( @xmath40.54 kev ) , the steep spectra from rosat observations have been interpreted as soft excess emission .",
    "this is a problem which is particular to agn spectra ( however , it should be noted that the pspc data of quasars investigated by laor et al ( 1994 ) are consistent with a single power - law and no soft excess component below 0.5 kev is required ) . for seyfert galaxies like ngc5548 ,",
    "reflection also makes spectral slopes flat in the asca band ( @xmath8 kev ) .",
    "these effects from the difference in bandpass between satellites could result in different measurements of spectral slope .",
    "we found a difference of photon - index ( @xmath9 ) measured with the rosat pspc and the asca sis during the simultaneous observation of ngc5548 .",
    "the asca data below 4 kev are not affected by reflection ( see section 3 ) in this object .",
    "although we are not able to assess exactly how much the soft excess component addes to the power - law continuum below 0.4 kev , we see no evidence for a soft x - ray flare during the observation ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the rosat pspc data are fully consistent with a simple power - law when the warm absorption is taken into account ( fig .",
    "5 ) and no extra soft x - ray component is required . as fig . 7",
    "demonstrates that the pspc data are significantly steeper than the asca data in the 0.52 kev band , we can rule out the possibility of bandpass effects for the different spectral slope measurements .",
    "therefore errors in calibration between the two satellites are the likely explanation .",
    "ngc5548 was observed with the rosat pspc several times .",
    "the first observation was carried out during the rosat pv phase ( 1990 july 1621 ) with a different detector ( pspc - c ) , which ceased operating on 1991 jan 25 ; the results were published by nandra et al ( 1993 ) .",
    "the observed flux suggests that the source during the observation was in its low state with no soft x - ray flare taking place , but a weak excess soft x - ray component was found below 0.5 kev ( nandra et al 1993 ) .",
    "a simple power - law fit to the spectrum gives @xmath10 , which is slightly steeper than the asca value , but similar .",
    "however , when ngc5548 was observed with the pspc - c once again during the rosat all sky survey ( shartel et al 1997 ) at a flux level similar to the present observation and 01b , a steep photon - index , @xmath11 , was found ( shartel et al 1997 ) .",
    "after the change of detector ( pspc - b ) , the rosat spectra show similarly steeper slopes , @xmath12 for the normal state spectrum ( done et al 1995 ; this work ) . the flat power - law slope reported in nandra et al ( 1993 ) is exceptional possibly because the source was in its low state , as other seyfert 1 galaxies often show an anti - correlation between x - ray spectral slope and flux ( e.g. , mushotzky , done , & pounds 1994 ) .    the calibration of the asca sis for the soft x - ray band has been a controversial issue .",
    "photon - index and column density measurements of 3c58 , a galactic synchrotron nebula , with einstein observatory ipc , exosat me / le , ginga lac and asca agree within uncertainties , although the scatter in  values derived from different ccd chips of the sis imply a systematic error ( dotani et al 1996 ) .",
    "general agreement on the systematic error in column density measurements indicates that the sis over - estimates  value by 2@xmath13 .",
    "the other possible sources which could contribute to the systematic error of the sis calibration are a ) dfe and echo corrections in the response matrices for the bright - mode data used here ; b ) the rdd effect ; and c ) uncertainty in the sis gain .",
    "the comparison with the faint mode data has verified that the effects of the dfe and echo are taken into account in the response matrix with enough accuracy .",
    "the rdd effect appears to reduce the efficiency by @xmath14 per cent , but it is unlikely to affect the spectral form , since the effect is almost energy independent .",
    "the sis gain is calibrated within 0.5 per cent accuracy ( dotani et al 1996 ) .",
    "none of the possible systematic errors in the sis data considered above is , therefore , sufficient to explain the difference between the results from the two satellites in the observation of ngc5548 reported here .",
    "simultaneous observations of the quasar 3c273 with asca , rxte and bepposax have been recently carried out .",
    "the three satellites agree on the measurement of spectral slope ( @xmath15 from asca sis and gis , rxte / pca , bepposax / mecs ) .",
    "the bepposax / lecs , which covers the energy range of 0.14 kev , found an edge - like feature at 0.5 kev and a steep soft x - ray component below 0.4 kev ( grandi et al 1997 ) .",
    "the sis and the lecs are in a good agreement ( orr et al 1998 ) .",
    "relative differences in  measured by the two detectors is reported , by yaqoob et al ( 1997 ) using the latest calibration , as @xmath16@xmath17  for the s0 and @xmath16@xmath18  for the s1 .    during asca ao-5 ,",
    "ngc5548 was observed with asca and euve simultaneously .",
    "the extrapolation of the asca spectrum matches the highest energy end of the euve / sw measurement ( kaastra et al 1999 ; kunieda et al 1998 ) .",
    "as the euve data cover the soft portion of the rosat bandpass , this may provide further support for the asca result .",
    "there are a number of discontinuities in the effective area curves of the instruments originating from the materials used in the x - ray telescope and detectors .",
    "these can cause a problem with the energy calibration . in the asca response , uncertainties due to an oxygen edge at @xmath40.5 kev in the sis detector and a gold edge at 2.2 kev in the xrt ( this residual is approximately modelled with ascaarf ) have been noticed .",
    "a very deep carbon edge is present in the pspc response , which removes virtually all the efficiency in the 0.30.5 kev band .",
    "misplacement of an edge would introduce an excess or deficit of effective area .",
    "this problem is more relevant to the pspc than the asca sis , given the poor spectral resolution .",
    "in summary , ( 1 ) the rosat pspc yields a photon - index steeper than the asca sis by @xmath9 for the simultaneous observation of ngc5548 .",
    "( 2 ) the steep spectral slope obtained from the pspc can not be accounted for by any soft excess emission below the asca bandpass ( below @xmath190.5 kev ) .",
    "( 3 ) results on the spectral form from asca sis data on other objects agree with that from other instruments ; einstein ipc , exosat me / le , gigna lac , bepposax lecs and mecs , and euve sw . ( 4 ) the measured fluxes seem to be consistent between asca and rosat , when the error of the sis flux measurement is taken into account .",
    "the discrepancy between asca and rosat also appears to affect measurements of _ excess _ absorption in clusters of galaxies .",
    "allen & fabian ( 1997 ) reported that the excess absorption column densities of the cooling flow cluster abell 2199 obtained from the asca sis and einstein observatory sss agree well with each other , but the rosat pspc gives a significantly lower excess column density .",
    "the determination of excess column densities depends on the detailed shape of the spectrum over the 0.51 kev range .",
    "it is not clear , if fig .",
    "7 is a guide , that rosat pspc results will be correct in this respect . if , however , the rosat pspc energy calibration is correct , and the source of the discrepancy lies in its response amplitude , then energy - dependent results such as total column density estimates of all classes of source and the temperatures of clusters where lines ( e.g. , the fe - l complex ) are important will be unaffected by the problem discussed here .",
    "our results indicate that caution should be applied when ( over ) interpreting differences between rosat and asca spectra .",
    "given the fact that the spectra in fig .",
    "7 depends on the exact spectral form of a source , it is not advisable to try to correct other pspc spectra using this figure , since it may lead to a false result .",
    "the predicted spectral response curves of both satellites need reconsideration ( although an improved calibration of the pspc has been attempted ( s. snowden , priv .",
    "comm . ) , the calibration files are not publicly available ) .",
    "we thank all the members of the asca pv team and the asca guest observer facility at nasa s goddard space flight center .",
    "tadayasu dotani is especially thanked for valueable comments on the sis calibration .",
    "tahir yaqoob and the referee are also thanked for their helpful comments on the paper .",
