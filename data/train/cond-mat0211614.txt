    "the recent discovery of room temperature ferromagnetism in co - doped 2  anastase@xcite has led to a great deal of activity both to understand the origins of ferromagnetic order in this material and to raise the magnetic ordering temperature .",
    "@xcite one promising line of inquiry is to understand first the role of dopants and native defects in the 2  host .",
    "for example , the location of co dopants in this material ( substitutional versus interstitial ) , their oxidation state , and their magnetic properties have been the subject of intense scrutiny .",
    "@xcite furthermore , it has been suggested that o vacancies , which are believed to give rise to the observed _ n_-type behavior in pure 2  anatase,@xcite may provide free electrons which mediate the exchange interaction between the co dopants.@xcite this possibility is very different from the hole mediated exchange interactions which are believed to describe ferromagnetic order in a wide variety of other dilute magnetic semiconductors , including inmnas , gamnas , and mnge,@xcite and may have a direct bearing on the origin of the anomalously high curie temperature observed in co - doped 2  anatase .    in this paper , we first use density - functional theory to determine the electronic structure , formation energy , and electrical activity of co dopants and several native defects in 2  anatase .",
    "( in the remainder of this paper we will use `` defects '' to refer to both co dopants and native defects . )",
    "we then use standard methods to calculate , as a function of temperature , the concentrations of each defect in the 2  host over a range of co and o chemical potentials relevant to different growth conditions . in summary",
    ", we find that o vacancies do not play any significant role in co - doped anatase .",
    "moreover , we find that the observed _ n_-type behavior in co - doped 2  strongly suggests that roughly half of the total co content is in interstitial sites . under these conditions we find an enhancement  relative to the co@xmath0 low spin state  of the average value of the local magnetic moment , in good agreement with experiment .",
    "finally , under these conditions essentially all of the of co  both interstitial and substitutional  occurs in oxidation state ii , as observed experimentally .",
    "we begin by briefly reviewing the relevant experimental results for co - doped 2  anatase .",
    "we concentrate solely on experimental results for samples in which co is believed to be homogeneously distributed ; hence , we do not address co clustering or its consequences .",
    "we focus on three observations which show good experimental reproducibility : ( 1 ) the electrical nature of the samples ( insulating versus _ n_-type or _",
    "p_-type ) , ( 2 ) the co oxidation state , and ( 3 ) the average magnetic moment per co dopant .",
    "although the original work of matsumoto and coworkers estimated the ferromagnetic ordering temperature to be larger than 400 k , the average magnetic moment per co and _ n_-type carrier concentration were modest , 0.32  and 10@xmath1/@xmath2 respectively .",
    "more recent efforts have led to a larger magnetic moment per co of 1.26 , @xcite and to _ n_-type carrier densities of 10@xmath3/@xmath2.@xcite these increased values are likely due to improvements in sample quality achievable with oxygen plasma - assisted molecular - beam epitaxy ( opmbe).@xcite for example , these samples were well characterized to rule out co inclusions as a source of the ferromagnetism.@xcite using both co 2_p _ photoemission and co k - shell x - ray absorption near - edge structure ( xanes ) , the co dopants in 2  anatase were shown to have a formal oxidation state of ii .",
    "a strong correlation between the magnetic and transport properties was demonstrated : both highly doped and highly resistive samples are typically non - magnetic , consistent with a picture of carrier - mediated ferromagnetism competing with an antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction.@xcite",
    "to understand the role of defects in 2  anatase , we initially adopt a simple picture of isolated impurities . in this approach , we first determine the energy required for the defect to form in a given charge state .",
    "we then use a standard thermodynamic approach to determine the expected concentration of such defects at a given temperature .",
    "we assume that the defects do not interact , except indirectly via charge transfer between them .",
    "thus , for example , we do not address the origin of the apparent ferromagnetic coupling between co dopants .",
    "the defects we consider in this work are : interstitial co ( ) , substitutional co on the ti site ( ) , o vacancies ( ) , interstitial ti ( ) , and defect complexes consisting of nearest - neighbor pairs of substitutional co and o vacancies ( ) . there are two crystallographically distinct types of such complexes : a  pair oriented along the @xmath4-axis and a pair oriented nearly in the @xmath5 plane .",
    "we refer to these as -_c _ and -_ab _ , respectively .",
    "we make no assumptions about which defects are donors and which are acceptors , whether they are neutral or charged , or how many are actually present . at a given temperature , the concentration of each defect ( in a given charge state )",
    "will be determined by its formation energy .",
    "we use density - functional theory in a supercell approach to calculate these formation energies according to @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the total energy of a supercell containing one defect in charge state @xmath8 ; @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the number and chemical potential ( energy per atom in the ground - state phase ) of each atomic species in the supercell ; and  is the fermi energy , measured with respect to the valence band maximum ( vbm ) of the host.@xcite although the fermi energy appears to be an independent variable here , it is in fact determined by the constraint of electroneutrality , as described below .",
    "also , we note that although the total energies on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "[ formenergy_eq ] depend on whether all - electron or pseudopotential methods are used , the formation energy itself is analogous to a binding energy , and can therefore be accurately calculated within either method .    in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the concentration of each defect , @xmath11 , is determined by its formation energy : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of sites per unit volume available to the defect .",
    "since the formation energies depend on the chemical potentials and the fermi level , it is evident that the concentrations also depend on these quantities .",
    "the concentrations must also satisfy the constraint of overall electrical neutrality ; this provides an additional equation that we use to determine  for any given choice of chemical potentials .",
    "the electroneutrality condition must take into account the contributions not only from charged defects , but also from @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( the hole and electron carrier densities ) .",
    "thus , for each given choice of the oxygen chemical potential , @xmath16 , and cobalt chemical potential , @xmath17 , the following equation must be numerically solved : @xmath18 here , the sum is over all defects , @xmath11 , in all possible charge states , @xmath8 .",
    "the ti chemical potential does not enter explicitly into this equation for reasons discussed in the following section , and , of course , the co chemical potential is only relevant for defects involving co. the carrier densities _",
    "p _ and _ n _ are evaluated using the conventional semiconductor expressions along with the _ ab initio _ density of states of the host material , with a scissors operator applied to give the experimental band gap .",
    "the atomic chemical potentials , @xmath10 , on the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ formenergy_eq ] are closely related to the experimental growth conditions .",
    "a high value of chemical potential of a particular atomic species is equivalent to a growth environment that is rich in that species ( in the sense of high partial pressure ) .",
    "the chemical potentials of ti and o which enter into eq .",
    "[ formenergy_eq ] are not independent : equilibrium between the ti and o atomic reservoirs and bulk 2  anatase requires that @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the total energy of bulk anatase .",
    "moreover , in order to preclude the precipitation of bulk hcp ti or o@xmath21 dimers there are additional thermodynamic restrictions on the individual chemical potentials : @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the energy per atom in an o@xmath21 dimer in its spin triplet ground state and @xmath25 is the energy per atom in hcp ti .",
    "it is conventional to refer to the upper limit in eq .",
    "[ boundsochempot_eq ] as the o - rich limit and , similarly , to the upper limit in eq .",
    "[ boundtischempot_eq ] as the ti - rich limit .",
    "because of the relationship between @xmath26 and @xmath16 in eq",
    ".  [ chempot_eq ] , there are only two independent variables in this approach : the o and co chemical potentials .",
    "this explains why the ti chemical potential does not enter explicitly into eq .",
    "[ neutral_eq ] .",
    "thus , for a given choice of @xmath17 and @xmath16 , all the other quantities ( including @xmath27 ) in eq .",
    "[ neutral_eq ] are completely determined . in practice",
    ", we eliminate @xmath17 as an independent variable by constraining the total co concentration to a typical experimental value ( 5% ) .",
    "hence , in our formulation , the concentration of all defects is entirely determined by the choice of o chemical potential and the constraint of total co concentration .",
    "although temperature appears in both eq .",
    "[ formenergy_eq ] ( implicitly ) and eq .  [ concentration_eq ] ( explicitly ) , our results are not especially sensitive to this variable .",
    "moreover , we stress that the temperature appearing in eq .",
    "[ concentration_eq ] has no connection to the magnetic ordering temperature , and should instead be understood simply as the temperature at which we evaluate the concentration of defects in equilibrium with their respective reservoirs . upon completion of growth , we consider the reservoirs to be disconnected and hence the number of these constituents to be fixed .",
    "thus we set the temperature to a particular value and examine the behavior of the system as a function of the o chemical potential . to this end",
    ", we calculate the defect concentrations using a typical growth temperature of 873 k.@xcite      the total energy calculations were performed in a supercell consisting of a 3@xmath283@xmath282 periodic repetition of the primitive unit cell ; thus , for the pure 2  host , these supercells contain 108 atoms .",
    "structural relaxation was performed within a sphere of radius of 4   centered on the defect in question ; calculations using a sphere radius of 5   give the same total energy to within 50 mev .",
    "this approach has proven both efficient and accurate for other similar metal - oxide insulators.@xcite the total energy calculations were evaluated in the local - density approximation ( lda ) within the ultrasoft pseudopotential formalism@xcite as implemented in the vasp code,@xcite with the zone center used to sample the brillouin zone of the supercells .",
    "a kinetic - energy cutoff of 400 ev was used in all total energy evaluations .",
    "only defects involving co atoms were treated in a spin - polarized fashion .",
    "the ground state of bulk hcp ti was treated non - magnetically , bulk hcp co was treated in an ferromagnetic configuration , and the total energy of the 2  reference dimer was evaluated for the spin triplet .    since the fermi energy in eq .",
    "[ formenergy_eq ] is measured with respect to the vbm of the host , we must align the vbm in the charged defect supercell with that of the host material . to this end",
    ", we used a local site average of the electrostatic potential to define a reference energy ; this local average was evaluated by a test charge approach in which we calculate the electrostatic energy of a narrow gaussian charge distribution far from the defect .",
    "we have checked that using , as an alternative , the ti 3_p _ semi - core eigenvalues gives very similar results . including the zone sampling , kinetic - energy cutoff , lattice relaxation and choice of reference energy",
    ", we estimate the numerical uncertainty in our results to be 100150 mev , sufficient for addressing trends with respect to growth conditions .",
    "to compute the total energy of a charged periodic system , we use a standard procedure which systematically corrects for the artificial and slowly converging coulomb interaction between charged defects.@xcite a neutralizing homogeneous background charge density is first added to the total charge density ; this makes the total energy a well - defined quantity .",
    "next , the artificial interaction among the charged defects within this neutralizing background is subtracted from the total energy ; this interaction is estimated by expanding the defect - induced electron density in a multipole series up to quadrupole order and then computing the contribution to the total energy from the interaction of these multipoles.@xcite    finally , we note that although the electronic band gap does not enter explicitly into eq .",
    "[ formenergy_eq ] , the lda underestimation of the gap does affect the formation energies of shallow donors , such as o vacancies and interstitial co. we have observed , however , that the depths of these donor levels ( relative to the conduction - band edge ) are essentially independent of the value of the band gap .",
    "we demonstrated this by calculating the position of the donor level using an artificially reduced lattice constant ; as the band gap increases with decreasing lattice constant , the donor level closely tracks the conduction - band edge .",
    "thus , we have corrected the formation energies of these donors using the experimental value of the band gap and the depth of the donor levels given within lda .",
    "in addition , we assume that the lda correctly predicts the formation energies of the @xmath292 charge states of these defects , because all defect levels are empty in this charge state .",
    "we discuss first the electronic structure of the isolated substitutional co dopant .",
    "[ coti_n0dos_fig](a ) shows the single - particle levels of neutral substitutional co , as determined from the eigenvalue spectra at @xmath30 using a 108-atom supercell .",
    "the point group for this defect is @xmath31 , so that all but one of the 3@xmath32-orbital degeneracies are lifted by the crystal field ; nevertheless , the environment surrounding the co dopant is still very nearly cubic , so that the @xmath33 and @xmath34 parentage of these levels is easily seen .",
    "there are 3 occupied majority - spin levels and 2 occupied minority - spin levels , yielding a net magnetic moment of 1 .",
    "it is instructive to study separately the exchange splitting and crystal - field splitting .",
    "this separation occurs naturally in the @xmath35 charge state , for which the exchange splitting vanishes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ coti_n0dos_fig](b ) . in this case the largest crystal - field splitting , about 1 ev , is between the @xmath33 and @xmath34 manifolds , with the @xmath33 manifold near the lda conduction - band edge and the @xmath34 near the valence - band edge .",
    "the @xmath31 crystal field further splits the @xmath33 manifold into an upper @xmath36 level of @xmath37 symmetry and a lower @xmath38 level of @xmath39 symmetry ; this splitting is 0.3 ev .",
    "likewise , the crystal field splits the @xmath34 manifold into an upper @xmath40 level of @xmath41 symmetry and a two - fold @xmath42 level of ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) symmetry ; this splitting is 0.2 ev .    for charge states with non - zero magnetic moments , we find that the exchange splitting varies approximately linearly with the magnetic moment .",
    "( since the orbital moment is strongly quenched,@xcite we regard the magnetic and spin moments as equivalent . ) for neutral substitutional co , the exchange splitting within the @xmath33 manifold is 0.2 ev for both levels . within the @xmath34 manifold ,",
    "the exchange splitting is strongly orbital - dependent : 0.5 ev for the @xmath40 levels and 0.3 ev for the @xmath42 levels .",
    "the calculated magnetic moments of substitutional co in different charge states , summarized in table  [ tab_mag ] , can now be easily understood from the results of fig .",
    "[ coti_n0dos_fig ] . for the neutral substitutional",
    ", there is a two - fold degenerate half - filled minority spin level at the fermi level . removing an electron from this level leads to a @xmath291 charge state with a moment of 2 . likewise , adding an electron to this level leads to a @xmath451 charge state with zero moment , since the @xmath34 manifold is now completely filled .",
    "the stable charge states and magnetic moments for interstitial co are quite different from the substitutional case .",
    "for example , we find that all charge states experience off - center structural relaxations of order 1  , lifting all remaining orbital degeneracies .",
    "the @xmath292 charge state of interstitial co , which is the lowest - energy charge state over most of the gap , has a moment of 1 .",
    "the @xmath291 charge state leads to a moment of 2 , whereas the neutral configuration has a moment of 1 .      since the correspondence between `` formal oxidation state '' and `` charge state '' will be an important issue here",
    ", we briefly summarize the relationship between the two .",
    "a similar discussion has been given for transition - metal impurities in gap.@xcite when a neutral co substitutes for ti in 2 , it takes on the oxidation state iv , the same as that of ti .",
    "hence a substitutional  in the @xmath451 charge state has a formal oxidation state of iii , and a substitutional  with charge @xmath452 has an oxidation state of ii .",
    "in a similar fashion one can relate the oxidation state and charge state of interstitial co ; in this case however , the charge state of the dopant is the same as the oxidation state .",
    "hence , neutral interstitial co has oxidation state 0 , the charge state @xmath291 has oxidation state i , and so forth . the oxidation state of co - related dopants in their various stable charge states are summarized in table  [ tab_mag ] .",

    "this is problematic , since the experimental finding of an oxidation state of ii for co would be consistent with a @xmath452 charge state for substitutional co. here we investigate whether the absence of a @xmath452 charge state within lda is due to the well - known underestimation of the band gap by the lda ( the lda predicts a band gap of 2.2 ev compared to the experimental value of 3.2 ev@xcite ) .    rather than attempting to correct the lda band gap , we propose a more direct description and try to estimate the formation energy of the @xmath452 charge state using our results for the energy levels of the @xmath451 charge state .",
    "since the formation energy is in general a linear function of the fermi energy , we do this in terms of the `` energy of transition , '' @xmath48 , which is defined as that value of @xmath27 for which @xmath49 is equal to @xmath50 . referring to fig .",
    "[ coti_n0dos_fig](b ) , we model the @xmath452 charge state by occupying the first available impurity level in the @xmath35 level diagram , namely the empty @xmath38 level . in this diagram , the @xmath38 level is at @xmath51 , so that occupying it will shift the fermi level upward by an amount @xmath52 .",
    "however , by singly occupying this level , one expects an accompanying exchange splitting and thus a downward shift of the fermi level .",
    "hence , we estimate the change in the fermi energy between the @xmath451 and @xmath452 charge state to be given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the energy of transition between the neutral and @xmath451 charge states ; @xmath52 is the crystal - field splitting between the @xmath55 and @xmath56 levels ; and @xmath57 is the exchange splitting due to the unpaired @xmath56 electron .",
    "we approximate @xmath57 by the @xmath38 exchange splitting for the neutral state ; this is 0.3 ev , as shown in fig.[coti_n0dos_fig](a ) .",
    "we neglect the onsite energy which arises from the interaction of the added @xmath56 electron with the @xmath34 electrons , but we expect this energy to be significantly smaller than the crystal - field energy , and hence expect eq .",
    "[ e2_eqtn ] to be reasonably accurate .",
    "a similar proposal could be made for more - negative charge states , for example , the @xmath453 charge state of substitutional co. however , we should then include an additional term , @xmath58 , for the onsite interaction between two @xmath56 electrons of opposite spin",
    ". this onsite energy will be large and can be estimated as @xmath59 where @xmath57 = 0.3 ev is again taken from the neutral configuration , but in this case accounts for the exchange energy lost when the moment is reduced from 1  to zero in the transition from the neutral to the @xmath451 charge state.@xcite we find @xmath60 1.0 ev and , hence , the @xmath453 charge state of substitutional co will lie well above the conduction - band edge , so that it ( and more highly charged negative states ) can be excluded from further consideration .      to address the characteristics of co - doped samples grown with opmbe",
    "we first consider conditions o - rich growth conditions .",
    "figure  [ orich_co0.05_fig ] shows the defect formation energies versus fermi energy in the o - rich limit , with the total co concentration constrained to be 5% . in comparison",
    "to experiment this scenario has three main shortcomings : ( 1 ) the average magnetic moment is 1 , significantly smaller than the measured value@xcite of 1.26 ; ( 2 ) the fermi level is well below midgap , whereas experimental measurements show the material to be _ n_-type;@xcite ( 3 ) co appears almost entirely as neutral substitutionals ( oxidation state iv ) , whereas co 2_p _ photoemission and xanes suggest the oxidation state of co is ii.@xcite these discrepancies suggest that the conditions present during growth of the samples are not o - rich .      to determine what growth conditions give rise to the observed magnetic and transport properties of co - doped anatase samples , we study the consequences of varying the o chemical potential away from its upper limit . in fig .",
    "[ obs_vs_o_0_05_fig ] we plot , versus the o chemical potential , the following quantities : concentration of of substitutional and interstitial co ; _ n _ and _ p _ carrier densities ; average magnetic moment per co ; percentage of co in different oxidation states ; and concentration of o vacancy - related defects ( the concentration of interstitial ti is negligible throughout this range of o chemical potential ) . for every value of the o chemical potential , the total concentration of co was constrained to 5% .      for values of the o chemical potential within @xmath611.5 ev of the o - rich limit , the substitutional site remains the preferred co site .",
    "the situation is very different in the o - poor limit . in this regime ,",
    "interstitial co ( in the @xmath291 and @xmath62 charge states ) becomes energetically competitive with substitutional co , and hence the concentrations of substitutional and interstitial co become comparable .",
    "this results from a subtle balance of the o and co chemical potentials .",
    "as one decreases the o chemical potential from its upper limit , the formation energies of substitutional dopants increases , since it costs more energy to replace ti with co as one moves toward the ti - rich limit .",
    "of course , as a function of the o chemical potential , the co chemical potential must also change , increasing monotonically to maintain the fixed total co concentration . at @xmath611 ev below the o - rich limit , interstitial co begins to play a role ; the preference for the interstitial site increases monotonically below this point , eventually accounting for most of the total co concentration in the o - poor limit .",

    "figure  [ obs_vs_o_0_05_fig](c ) shows the logarithm of the hole and electron carrier densities evaluated at 300 k as a function of the o chemical potential . near the o - rich limit",
