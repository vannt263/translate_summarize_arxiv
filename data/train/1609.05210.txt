    "about four decades have passed since a crude shape of the x - ray continuum from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) was first revealed ( e.g. , ives et al .",
    "1976 ; mushotzky et al .",
    "1980 ) , yet the origin of the main spectral components that have been progressively brought out is still largely unclear . the primary x - ray emission , usually described by a power law with high - energy ( @xmath3100 kev ) cutoff , is thought to stem from inverse compton scattering of ultraviolet ( uv ) disk photons in a coronal region of hot electrons ( e.g. , haardt & maraschi 1993 ) .",
    "the nature of this corona and of its coupling with the disk , however , remains unknown .",
    "neither do widely accepted explanations exist for the soft ( done et al .",
    "2012 ; vasudevan et al . 2014 ) or hard x - ray excesses ( risaliti et al . 2013 ; miller & turner 2013 ) , or the broad iron fluorescence lines at @xmath257 kev ( tanaka et al . 1995 ; inoue & matsumoto 2003 ) .",
    "in fact , intricate absorption by neutral and/or ionized gas along the line of sight can reproduce any sort of spectral curvature or deviation from the power - law continuum .",
    "the unique potential of x - ray observations as a means of probing the immediate surroundings of an accreting supermassive black hole ( smbh ) is therefore best exploited in the so - called _ bare _ active galaxies , where any obscuration effect is negligible .    the nearby ( @xmath4 ; osterbrock & phillips 1977 ) seyfert galaxy ark120is arguably the most remarkable object in the bare agn subclass .",
    "it is the x - ray brightest source of this type ( @xmath5 ; this work ; baumgartner et al .",
    "2013 ) , and it offers the cleanest view to the central engine .",
    "early high - resolution data taken with the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) onboard _ xmm  newton _ posed stringent constraints on the presence of any warm absorber , whose column density would be at least an order of magnitude lower than found in a typical seyfert 1 ( vaughan et al .",
    "moreover , no evidence for uv absorption emerges from the _ hubble space telescope _ spectrum ( crenshaw et al . 1999 ) .",
    "since it is not affected by any significant foreground screen , the observed x - ray emission of ark120can thus be regarded as representative of the intrinsic high - energy output of an agn , and of the physical processes associated with the inner accretion flow , such as comptonization and/or relativistic reflection .",
    "ark120displays all the x - ray spectral traits expected for an unobscured , radiatively efficient smbh , namely a smooth soft excess below 2 kev , an iron k - shell line complex possibly including a broad and skewed component , and a compton reflection hump peaking at about 30 kev ( e.g. , nardini et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the soft excess has always been noticeable in ark120since the first x - ray observations ( brandt et al .",
    "1993 ) , but its featureless appearance is compatible with several interpretations , the most relevant of which invoke either the comptonization of the seed uv photons in the warm disk atmosphere , or the blurring of the soft x - ray reflection - line forest in the strong gravity regime .",
    "the broad iron line and the compton hump are even more puzzling , since their relative intensity apparently decreased in a recent ( 2013 ) , combined observation with _ xmm ",
    "newton_and _ nustar _",
    ", when the source was found to be two times fainter than usual ( matt et al .",
    "2014 ) .    in order to address these open issues and shed new light on the intrinsic x - ray emission of agns ,",
    "ark120was the target of an extensive campaign carried out in 2014 march , consisting of an _ xmm ",
    "newton_long look ( @xmath2650 ks , or 7.5 days ) with joint high - resolution view of the iron - k band with the _ chandra_high - energy transmission grating ( pi : d. porquet ) , plus a simultaneous _ nustar_observation .",
    "here we focus on the properties of the iron k - shell emission features , which can be studied in great detail thanks to the unprecedented depth of the new data sets .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  2 we introduce the various observations and provide the basic information on the data reduction , while section  3 concerns the analysis of the time - averaged spectra . section  4 deals with the subsequent discovery of the short - term variability of iron fluorescence .",
    "these results and their possible implications on the physics of the x - ray corona are further discussed in section  5 , and conclusions are drawn in section  6 .",
    "the consequences of the soft x - ray , grating spectra on the bare character of ark120are the subject of a companion paper ( reeves et al .",
    "2016 ) , while the broadband analysis of the _ xmm  newton_and _ nustar_observations , and the modeling of the optical to hard x - ray spectral energy distribution will be presented in a forthcoming work ( d. porquet et al .",
    "2016 , in preparation ) .",
    "ark120was observed by _ xmm  newton_over four consecutive orbits between 2014 march 1824 ( table  [ to ] ) .",
    "the event files were reprocessed with the science analysis system ( sas ) v14.0 , applying the latest calibrations available on 2015 february . due to the source brightness",
    ", the epic instruments were operated in small window mode , although this course of action was not enough to prevent pile - up in the mos cameras .",
    "only the epic / pn ( strder et al . 2001 ) data were therefore taken into account , selecting the event patterns 04 ( single and double pixel ) .",
    "the source spectra and light curves were extracted from circular regions centered on the target , with radius of 30to avoid the edge of the chip .",
    "the background was evaluated over areas of the field of view where the contamination from the bright source is minimal , and its count rate is non negligible only in the final parts of each orbit , which were discarded . after the correction for dead time and background flaring ,",
    "the total net exposure was @xmath2330 ks .",
    "redistribution matrices and ancillary response files for all the data sets were generated with the sas tasks ` rmfgen ` and ` arfgen ` .",
    "since there are several tens of counts per native energy channel in the fekband ( equivalent to a @xmath65@xmath7 significance at the observed background level ) , the 310 kev spectra were grouped into 30-ev bins not to unduly oversample the actual epic / pn resolution .",
    "this delivers about 1100 and 300 counts per bin around 5 and 8 kev , respectively . due to some inaccuracy in the calibration of the epic /",
    "pn energy scale , a gain correction was also applied ( see appendix  a ) .    as part of the 2014 campaign ,",

    ", on march 1722 .",
    "this is the only _ chandra_observation of ark120to date .",
    "due to scheduling constraints , it was split into three sequences with total exposure of @xmath2120 ks , overlapping with the two central _ xmm  newton_orbits .",
    "the data were reprocessed with the ciaov4.6 software package .",
    "only the first - order spectra were considered for both the medium- ( meg ) and high - energy grating ( heg ) , and the @xmath8 dispersion arms were combined .",
    "only a modest ( @xmath210% ) flux variation was observed between the individual sequences , whose spectra were therefore merged into a single one for each grating .",
    "this yielded a total of @xmath9 ( meg ; 0.75 kev ) and @xmath10 ( heg ; 18 kev ) counts .",
    "the background contribution to the count rate was negligible .",
    "the resulting spectra were initially binned to @xmath11 ( meg ) and 10 m(heg ) , which roughly correspond to the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) nominal resolution . to preserve the uniform spacing in wavelength units , in the hetg",
    "fits we made use of the @xmath12-statistic ( cash 1979 ) , although the number of counts in each bin exceeds 25 over most of the range covered by the present analysis .    in this study",

    "suzaku_one , performed on 2007 april 13 .",
    "the 2003 and 2013 _ xmm  newton_data were reduced with the same criteria adopted above .",

    "we started our analysis from the _ chandra_observation , since the high - resolution data would allow us to determine the intrinsic width of any narrow fekemission component . here",
    "we concentrate on the 38 kev band of the heg spectrum only , referring to reeves et al .",
    "( 2016 ) for a thorough discussion of the soft x - ray properties .",
    "we first fitted the continuum with a simple power law , after excluding the observed 57 kev energy range . a more complex model is not required , due to the absence of any spectral curvature above 3 kev ( appendix  b ) .",
    "this leaves clear residuals in emission at 6.07.2 kev in the rest frame , the most prominent of which is a narrow line at @xmath26.4 kev ( figure  [ ch ] ) .",
    "a pair of broader and shallower features are seen redwards and bluewards of this core , and a hint of a further line is present at @xmath27.1 kev . based on the visual inspection , we therefore included four gaussian profiles , letting the centroid energy , width , and normalization free to vary for each of them .",
    "we also adopted the finer resolution of 5 m(or 15 ev at 6 kev ) , which turns out to be more appropriate to fit such a rich and irregular fekspectrum .",
    "this model gives a statistic of @xmath22 , and the best - fit line parameters are summarized in table  [ tc ] .",
    "for ease of illustration , at this stage we dub the three major lines as k@xmath23 , k@xmath24 , and k@xmath25 , respectively ; their actual nature will be discussed in more detail later on .",
    "the faintest line at @xmath27.1 kev ( marginally consistent with fek@xmath26 ) is barely significant with its @xmath225 counts ( against @xmath2115 for k@xmath24 , @xmath280 for k@xmath23 , and @xmath265 for k@xmath25 ) . indeed , after its removal , the change in the fit statistic is completely negligible . as the heg spectrum becomes rather noisy beyond 7 kev",
    "( with @xmath2710 counts per 5-mbin ) , we do not consider this feature any further in this section .",
    "of the three provisional k@xmath0components , the red one is definitely the most puzzling , since it does not have the typical aspect of the gravitationally redshifted , extended wing of disk lines ( e.g. , miller 2007 ) . on the other hand , its energy of 6.13 kev and equivalent width ( ew ) of @xmath255 ev also rule out the possibility that this is just the compton shoulder ( yaqoob & murphy 2011 , and references therein ) of the k@xmath0emission feature from neutral iron at 6.4 kev .",
    "such an interpretation , in fact , is straightforward for the least ambiguous k@xmath24 ( @xmath28 ev ) , whose properties can thus be highly informative .",
    "its width @xmath29 ev corresponds to a fwhm velocity broadening of 4700@xmath1 , in good agreement with the values obtained for h@xmath26 in the optical ( 58006100 ; wandel et al .",
    "1999 ; marziani et al . 2003 ) and for the soft x - ray lines from he - like species ( reeves et al .",
    "the centroid of k@xmath25 at 6.68 kev , instead , would be compatible with a fexxvk@xmath0identification ( but see below ) .",
    "its slightly larger width compared to k@xmath24 could be due to the emitting gas being closer to the illuminating source .",
    "however , a common velocity broadening of @xmath25500 , strikingly similar to the h@xmath26one , returns an indistinguishable fit ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "we can safely exclude that the k@xmath0emission core is unresolved ; once we fix the width of k@xmath24 to zero , the fit quality declines by @xmath31 .",
    "this alternative model is not satisfactory on qualitative grounds either , since both k@xmath23 and k@xmath25 are shifted in energy and distorted into a blended , formless profile ( compare with figure  [ ch ] ) .",
    "the confidence contours derived for k@xmath24 are shown in figure  [ cc ] . in spite of some degeneracy with the adjacent features ,",
    "the neutral fek@xmath0emission line is resolved at a @xmath23@xmath7 significance level .",
    "its ew of 91@xmath32 ev is broadly consistent with , yet somewhat larger than what expected in the context of the x - ray baldwin effect ( iwasawa & taniguchi 1993 ) . considering the apparent anti - correlation of the fek@xmath0equivalent width with either the 210 kev x - ray luminosity ( @xmath210@xmath33 in ark120 ) or the x - ray to eddington luminosity ratio ( @xmath2@xmath34 ) , we should observe a value up to two times smaller ( bianchi et al .",
    "2007 ; shu et al .",
    "2010 ) . in principle , this leaves room for a hidden disk - line component , possibly asymmetric and contributing to some extent to both k@xmath23 and k@xmath25 .",
    "indeed , it is worth noting that these structures can be excellently reproduced ( @xmath35 ) as the red and blue horns of a disk line ( e.g. , laor 1991 ) centered at 6.41@xmath210.05 kev , arising at a distance of @xmath2200 gravitational radii ( @xmath36 , where the black hole mass @xmath37 is @xmath2@xmath38 in ark120 ; peterson et al .",

    "overall , ark120displays a broad and irregular emission - line complex in the 67 kev energy range , where the main feature corresponds to the k@xmath0transition in neutral iron around 6.4 kev .",
    "its profile is well resolved by the _ chandra_grating to a fwhm of @xmath24700 , consistent with the typical velocity broadening of the optical broad - line region .",
    "the narrow feik@xmath0accounts for less than one half of the total line emission over this band , though .",
    "the residuals take the shape of a red wing down to @xmath26 kev and of a blue plateau across 6.7 kev , connecting to a second , apparent feature centered just below 7 kev .",
    "energy , equivalent width , and variability rule out an interpretation of the red excess as the compton shoulder of the main , 6.4-kev k@xmath0line .",
    "the wing s strength reached a maximum during a 2007 _ suzaku_observation , dropped by a factor of @xmath223 following a low - flux state of the x - ray source in 2013 , and then recovered one year later .",
    "this behavior suggests the presence of a fekreflection component from the accretion disk .",
    "indeed , a model including two narrow ( @xmath47 ev ) lines at 6.40 and 6.98 kev plus a mildly distorted relativistic disk line successfully reproduces the entire fekemission complex in ark120over the different epochs . from the time - averaged spectra alone",
    "the intensity of the former pair would seem approximately constant , as might be expected for blr gas , only sensitive to the average continuum over long timescales",
    ". the 7-kev narrow feature would thus be ( mistakenly ) identified with the fexxvik@xmath0 , possibly blended with the neutral k@xmath26 .",
    "some additional fluctuations around 6.46.5 kev could be ascribed to the elusive broad component , which is responsible for most of the short - term spectral changes .",
    "the disk - line parameters point to an origin in a moderate relativistic regime , at a few / several tens of gravitational radii of distance from the central black hole . rather than a disk truncation",
    ", this likely implies that the main x - ray corona , if extended , smooths out any reflection from the inner disk .",
    "diffuse flares associated with magnetic reconnection events might be involved instead to efficiently illuminate the line - emitting regions further out .",
    "such a conjecture is supported by the fekexcess emission map obtained from the 2014 _ xmm ",
    "newton_monitoring , which covered four consecutive satellite orbits for a span of 7.5 days .",
    "this shows that both the red wing and the bulk of the 6.57 kev excess ( encompassing also the tentative , blr - like fexxviline ) undergo significant intensity variations in about @xmath23050 ks ( i.e. , 1015 hours ) , and that they are substantially uncorrelated with each other . the broad fekemission feature detected in ark120could",
    "then be the superposition of several different peaks arising from short - lived , yet continuously generated orbiting hotspots on the accretion disk surface .",
    "perhaps similar observable effects could be produced also as a result of clumpiness in the corona and/or density inhomogeneities in the disk , provided that these are highly dynamic .",
    "future x - ray observatories like _",

    "2004 ) , this is due instead to a known inaccuracy in the calibration of the epic / pn energy scale for some of the most recent _ xmm  newton_observations ( as also discussed in marinucci et al .",

    "indeed , in the simultaneous _ chandra_data , its centroid falls at @xmath48 kev ( section  3.1 ) .",
    "overall , this @xmath250-ev shift in the iron - k energy range is not the most conspicuous shortcoming .",
    "regardless of the model adopted for the continuum , a clear residual structure is left around @xmath22.22.3 kev , in correspondence with the gold absorption edge in the detector s effective area . while not strictly relevant to the analysis presented in this paper , this feature was very useful to mitigate the calibration problems . as a first approximation",
    ", we used the ` gain ` function within xspec , which modifies the energy response according to the expression @xmath49 ( in kev ) .",
    "we then fitted the average 2014@xmath50 spectrum ( obtained by merging the four observations ) over the 110 kev band , by means of a phenomenological double power - law model , plus the required emission lines . the best slope and offset to fix the gain around the au - m edge are @xmath51 and @xmath52 kev , respectively .",
    "as a by - product , these parameters also return sensible values of the iron - k energy scale ( with the main line now falling at @xmath53 kev ; section  3.2 ) , and were thus assumed in all of the analysis . to a lesser degree , even the 2013 spectrum appears to be affected by some gain issues .",
    "its response was then improved through a similar procedure , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 kev .",
    "all the line energies reported in the paper for both the 2013 and the 2014 _ xmm  newton_observations are gain - corrected .",
    "remarkably , as the 2003 epic / pn data are confidently exempt from calibration problems , the centroids of the two narrow lines in this epoch ( table  [ tx ] ) corroborate the validity of the adopted gain correction for the most recent spectra , independently of _ chandra_/heg .",
    "as long as the evaluation of the emission components parameters is the foremost intention of our analysis , we verified that the exact continuum shape has no practical consequence .",
    "indeed , thanks to the lack of any x - ray absorption in ark120 , the 310 kev continuum shows little complexity , and can be approximated with no loss of accuracy with a simple power law .",
    "for instance , here we consider the ` relline`model described in section 4.1 . by removing the three emission lines , and neglecting the observed 57 kev energy range ,",
    "the fit statistic for the 35 plus 710 kev power - law continuum is @xmath56 .",
    "any residual spectral curvature can then be estimated by introducing a fictitious partial covering absorber and refitting .",
    "the improvement ( @xmath57 ) is similar to the one achieved through the ` relxill`model ( section 3.4 ; @xmath58 over the same range ) , and is mainly driven by the width of the continuum window ( see also footnote  3 ) . even allowing for a slight curvature",

    "we then introduced another gaussian in the ` relline`model , fixing its energy to 7.06 kev and its intensity to 0.15 times the 6.4-kev k@xmath0one ( e.g. , molendi et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the subsequent fit of the merged 2014@xmath50 _ xmm ",
    "newton_spectrum proved that the new line is not strongly required statistically ( @xmath59 ) , and that its main effect is to push the neighboring , purported fexxvik@xmath0redwards to 6.92@xmath210.03 kev .",
    "since the two features appear to some extent mutually exclusive , we then tried to drop the latter and let the relativistic line compensate for the lack of any narrow emission from ionized iron species . as a result , the ` relline`centroid moves to 6.68@xmath60 kev ( compatible with fexxvk@xmath0at rest ) , yet the red wing is not perfectly reproduced .",
    "this is reflected by the overall change in the goodness of fit , with @xmath61 ( for an @xmath62-test chance probability of @xmath63 ) .",
    "we conclude that the 7-kev excess , besides the variable component from the disk , possibly contains also a blend of narrow fexxvik@xmath0and feik@xmath26 , whose relative and total intensities are very hard to determine .",
    "the presence of fexxviis supported by some conspicuous residuals at @xmath64 and 8.72@xmath65 kev in 2014@xmath50 , consistent with the higher - order k@xmath26and k@xmath66 transitions . when fixed at 8.25 and 8.70 kev with the same fwhm of the other narrow lines , these two features bring an improvement of @xmath67 and 15.5 against the loss of two d.o.f .",
    ", lowering the fit statistic of 2014@xmath50 to @xmath68 .",
    "due to the huge difference in ionization potential , it is definitely unlikely for neutral and h - like iron to be co - spatial , thus requiring a substantial blr stratification .",
    "in order to quantify the preference of a ` hotspot ' scenario over a standard ` disk line ' one , involving two narrow , blr - like emission lines plus a coherent , broad feature , we also fitted the quiescent , red flare , and blue flare states ( figure  [ hs ] ) with the ` relline`model adopted for the time - averaged spectra .",
    "the intensity of the three lines was assumed to be constant with time .",
    "this returns a @xmath69 of 529/490 , clearly worse than the outcome of the hotspot model ( 500/485 ; with a pair of variable gaussian/`kyr1line ` components besides the 6.4-kev k@xmath0 ) , yet still broadly acceptable .",
    "with respect to the 2014@xmath50 best fit ( table  [ tx ] ) , there are two main differences : the 7-kev narrow line is shifted to @xmath70 kev , although the centroid energy is virtually unconstrained due to the sizeable intensity drop ( ew @xmath71 10 ev ) ; and the disc line is now found at @xmath72 kev ( with @xmath73 ) .",
    "overall , these findings are thus consistent with the case discussed in appendix  c , where the neutral k@xmath26takes the place of the fexxvik@xmath0 .",
    "as the two models are non - nested , a proper statistical comparision can be obtained by means of the corrected akaike information criterion ( aic ; akaike 1974 ) and/or of the bayesian information criterion ( bic ; schwarz 1978 ) .",
    "for @xmath74 free parameters , @xmath75 data points , and @xmath76 , these are defined as : @xmath77 the correction term in aic accounts for the finiteness of the sample . from the single aic values ,",
    "the akaike weight of each model can be computed as @xmath78 .",
    "for the ` disk line ' case , it is @xmath79 , so indicating that the ` hotspot ' picture is strongly preferred by the data .",
    "conversely , bic penalizes much more heavily than aic the use of unnecessary free parameters ( on aggregate , @xmath80 in the latter model against @xmath81 in the former ) , and would still marginally favor the ` disk line ' scenario in spite of the worse @xmath82 . the difference @xmath83 , however , is too small to be conclusive : the schwarz weights , equivalent to the akaike ones , are 0.628 ( disk line ) and 0.372 ( hotspot ) .",
    "as the aic and bic results are contradictory , and the merits of one method over the other in any specific situation are still matter of debate ( e.g. liddle 2004 , and references therein ) , we proceeded to further assess the true significance of fekvariability via monte carlo simulations .",
    "the constant ` relline`model , as evaluated above on the three distinctive spectral states extracted from the excess emission map , represents our null hypothesis .",
    "we first ran a test simulation , generating three spectra ( and relative background ) with the same exposure ( 21 ks ) and response files of the quiescent , red flare , and blue flare states .",
    "these were jointly fitted to derive a modified null hypothesis , which incorporates the uncertainties due to photon noise ( see also miniutti & fabian 2006 ) . with this refined model",
    ", we then performed the actual simulation .",
    "the output spectra were fitted twice , with the ( constant ) ` relline`model and the ( variable ) hotspot one .",
    "the @xmath13 was recorded , and all the steps were repeated 1000 times .",
    "the following @xmath13 distribution can be compared to the statistical improvement characterizing the observed data . in no case out of 1000",
    "is @xmath84 , the largest deviation from the null - hypothesis fit being @xmath85 ( figure  [ mc ] ) . with a false positive rate of less than 10@xmath86",
    ", it seems highly unlikely that the red and blue fektransient features are caused by noise in a constant disk - line profile .",
    "most of all , the lack of variability is hard to reconcile with the quiescent phase . with this in mind",
    ", we finally checked the significance of the changes experienced by the red fekexcess . for simplicity",
    ", we only examined the quiescent and red flare states . forcing the intensity of the red horn to be the same in both spectra , the fit deteriorates by @xmath87 .",
    "we therefore ran 1000 simulations according to the procedure described above , with a null hypothesis of no variability .",
    "each pair of fake data sets were then fitted with common and distinct normalizations of the gaussian profile at @xmath26.2 kev .",
    "the chance of obtaining a spurious improvement with @xmath88 is 37/1000 ( figure  [ mc ] ) .",
    "the variability of the red feature is then significant at the 96.3% level , in agreement with both the @xmath62-test probability ( 96.9% ) and the difference between the line s normalizations in the two spectral states ( @xmath22@xmath7 confidence ; section  5 ) .",
    "we note that this is a largely conservative figure from a general perspective , since the red excess is fainter than the blue one ( maximum ew of @xmath240 ev against @xmath290 ev ) , and the upper limit to its intensity is even lower in the blue flare state ( with @xmath89 for constant amplitude ) .     with respect to the null - hypothesis fits obtained from monte carlo simulations .",
    "top panel : the three fake spectra ( with same exposure , background , and flux of the real quiescent , red flare , and blue flare states ) are jointly fitted with both constant ` disk line ' and variable ` hotspot ' models . in a single case",
    "the statistical improvement is close to , yet still lower than the one found in the real data ( @xmath90 , red solid line ) , thus confirming the high significance of the short - term fekvariability .",
    "bottom panel : the simulated quiescent and red flare spectra are fitted with constant ( null hypothesis ) and variable intensity of the red fekexcess .",
    "the number of false positives ( 37/1000 ) sets a conservative confidence level for the observed variability of the individual transients to 96.3% ( see text).,width=529 ]    akaike , h.  1974 , ieee transactions on automatic control , 19 , 716 armitage , p.  j. , & reynolds , c.  s.  2003 , , 341 , 1041 ballantyne , d.  r. , turner , n.  j. , & blaes , o.  m.  2004 , , 603 , 436 ballantyne , d.  r. , turner , n.  j. , & young , a.  j.  2005 , , 619 , 1028 bardeen , j.  m. , press , w.  h. , & teukolsky , s.  a.  1972 , , 178 , 347 baumgartner , w.  h. , tueller , j. , markwardt , c.  b. , et al .",
