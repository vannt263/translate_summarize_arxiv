    "short - period binaries composed of a white dwarf and late - type star are of fundamental importance to astrophysics as they are progenitors of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and novae , some of which likely evolve to form type 1a supernovae .",
    "stellar evolution theory predicts that these systems are the outcome of a common envelope evolutionary phase in which frictions leads to a rapid spiraling down of the orbit of an initial wider binary @xcite . at the conclusion of the common envelope phase",
    ", the orbit of the system is expected to decay further as a result of angular momentum lost to gravitational radiation and to the magnetized wind of the unevolved component @xcite .",
    "as their separation decreases , the roche lobe of the secondary is reduced in size and is eventually completely filled , initiating the onset of mass transfer onto the white dwarf .",
    "the timescale for initiation of mass transfer in a post - common envelope binary depends critically on the angular momentum loss rate .",
    "while angular momentum loss through gravitational radiation is theoretically well - understood for the stars in cvs , there is no comprehensive theory of spin - down through magnetized winds that is expected to dominate the evolution of systems with periods above the cv period gap of @xmath5hr .",
    "it depends on the wind mass loss rate and the large scale stellar magnetic field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "both are extremely difficult to measure for late - type stars and are especially uncertain at the very rapid rotation rates of close binaries where magnetic proxies such as x - ray emission show saturation and supersaturation effects that appear to affect spin - down rates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    in this paper , we present _ xmm - newton _ observations of the intriguing da+m2 - 4 3.6hr eclipsing binary qs vir ( formerly more commonly known as ec  13471 - 1258 ) that was first discovered as a white dwarf ",
    "m dwarf binary in the edinburgh - cape blue object survey @xcite .",
    "qs  vir has gained considerable recent attention as a valuable diagnostic of close binary evolution and angular momentum loss .",
    "based on an extensive analysis of high - speed and multi - colour photometry , together with uv hst stis and visible light spectroscopy , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) concluded that the system filled its roche lobe and was probably undergoing very weak mass transfer and suggested the system might be a hibernating cataclysmic variable .",
    "it was detected in the rosat all sky survey ( rass ) at @xmath6  count  s@xmath3 @xcite implying an inconspicuous x - ray luminosity @xmath7  erg  s@xmath3much too low for an accreting cv .",
    "more recently , @xcite inferred the presence of a giant planet with mass @xmath8 in a 7.86  yr orbit based on long term period variations , although @xcite ruled this out from more complete eclipse monitoring .",
    "instead they find a third body in a highly elliptical orbit best fits the more complete data , noting that this explanation for the secular orbit change is also not without problems .",
    "@xcite found evidence for material possibly associated with wind accretion within the roche lobe of the white dwarf , while @xcite interpreted phase - specific absorption signatures as a stellar prominence originating from the m  dwarf .",
    "the latter also found the white dwarf to be slowly rotating , indicating a pre - cataclysmic evolutionary status .    here ,",
    "we report the discovery of deep , narrow x - ray eclipses locating the dominant source of x - rays on the white dwarf rather than the corona of the late - type star and implying ongoing accretion .",
    "qs  vir has one of the lowest accretion rates of known non - magnetic systems .",
    "this , together with its eclipsing nature and proximity ( 48  pc ; @xcite ) , renders qs  vir an interesting object for the study of cv evolution .",
    "qs  vir is an eclipsing binary with an inclination of @xmath9 and an orbital period of @xmath10 days . the component spectral types are classified as da and m24 with masses @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 , respectively @xcite .",
    "qs  vir was observed using the instruments on board the _ xmm - newton _ satellite @xcite .",
    "both rgs detectors @xcite operated in `` spectroscopy '' mode , while the epic - pn @xcite and both mos @xcite cameras operated in `` small window '' mode using a medium filter .",
    "the om telescope @xcite was used in `` fast mode '' with the @xmath15 filter , but a hardware glitch placed the source outside of the photometry window and severely compromised the data .",
    "a summary of the observations is reported in table  [ tab : obs ] . here",
    "we concentrate on the epic observations ; rgs spectra were of low signal - to - noise ratio , although a number of weak emission lines attributed to o  viii , fe  xvii , ne ix an ne x could be discerned .",
    "data were reduced with the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system software version 7.0.0 , updated with the latest calibration files . the epic - pn background - subtracted light curve with a 100s bin size is showed in fig .  [ fig : lc_pn ] .",
    "apart from the sizable flare 20  ks into the observation , which is likely due to coronal activity on the red dwarf , the most conspicuous feature of the light curve is the presence of deep eclipses of duration @xmath16s and a period of about 13  ks .",
    "this eclipse period and duration matches that found by @xcite in their uv - optical study of qs  vir , and we attribute the eclipses to the uv - bright white dwarf passing behind the red dwarf . at mid - eclipse ,",
    "the x - ray emission declines to about 15%  of its uneclipsed intensity , indicating that @xmath17%  of the x - ray signal originates from the vicinity of the white dwarf and dominates the quiescent coronal x - ray intensity of the m  dwarf .",
    "om frames were analyzed using custom software designed to extract the residual spill - over signal in the photometry window from point spread function wings . while not photometric , sufficient signal was recovered to verify that the x - ray and @xmath15-band eclipses coincided with each other .",
    "the epic - pn light curve phase - folded on the ephemeris for optical mid - eclipse derived from observations between 1992 - 2002 by @xcite succeeded in co - aligning eclipses in phase space .",
    "however , the x - ray eclipse preceded the optically - derived one by about 120s . this is a much larger offset than expected based on the period drift apparent in figure  3c of @xcite , indicating that the orbital period had shortened somewhat in the interval between the ephemeris epoch and our 2006 observations .",
    "this secular period shortening was confirmed recently by the later optical observations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the ephemerides of these works are similar for the epoch of our observations and adopting arbitrarily that of the former we find our x - ray and @xmath15-band eclipses are centered on the expected primary eclipse . the phase - folded x - ray light curve based on this ephemeris",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc_pn_cycles ] .",
    "each cycle of the phase - folded x - ray light curve was fitted with a trapezoidal profile to locate the times of ingress and egress .",
    "no significant variability in the eclipse mid - time or duration are present , and the time of second to third contact is @xmath18s , in reasonable agreement with the value of @xmath19s obtained from optical photometry by @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the eclipsed x - ray source is close to or coincident with the white dwarf photosphere .",
    "epic pn source photons were extracted from a circular region with a @xmath20 radius , while background was estimated from a surrounding annulus with an area of approximately ten times the source region .",
    "intervals showing particularly high background were excluded from the analysis . the extracted epic pn spectrum , rebinned such that each channel contains at least 35 counts , is illustrated in figure [ fig : pn_fit_flow ] .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have found that the x - ray spectra of cvs fall into two broad categories : optically - thin spectra resembling cooling flows ; and spectra with a hard continuum exhibiting signatures of a photoionized plasma .",
    "@xcite noted that the difference is likely to be associated with the accretion rate per unit area , with photoionization spectra belonging to magnetic systems with channeled accretion streams covering a small surface area , and optically - thin spectra coming from the accretion boundary layer of non - magnetic systems .",
    "cursory inspection of the epic spectrum of qs  vir reveals an optically - thin form not unlike that seen from active stellar coronae .",
    "this is reinforced by the few emission lines that could be discerned from the rgs spectra .",
    "we performed parameterized spectral modeling within the xspec program version 12 @xcite , using multi - temperature optically - thin plasma radiative loss models and a cooling flow model .",
    "a fixed absorption of @xmath21  @xmath22 , corresponding to negligible interstellar x - ray absorption for this nearby object , was adopted for both models .",
    "for the multi - temperature plasma , we employed a two - temperature mekal model ( a mlange of the models of @xcite and @xcite ) in which the temperatures were allowed to vary freely but the metallicity parameter was forced to assume the same value for both components .",
    "the best - fit model had a minimum value of the reduced @xmath23 statistic of @xmath24 , with 520 degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "for the cooling flow , we employed the isobaric flow model with emission measure verses temperature scaled inversely to the cooling time at that temperature @xcite implemented as the mekal - based mkcflow model .",
    "no redshift was included , and @xmath25 with 520 dof was obtained with metallicity , minimum and maximum temperatures , and normalization as free parameters .",
    "the parameter estimation results are reported in table  [ tab : fit ] and the best - fit model is illustrated in figure  [ fig : pn_fit_flow ] . at face value , the cooling flow model describes the data slightly better than the two - temperature one , though we caution that systematic uncertainties in the model and instrument response are not included in the analysis .",
    "the detection of clear , sharp x - ray eclipses phased with the optical eclipses provides an unambiguous indication of ongoing accretion in the qs  vir system . from the epic spectrum , we find the total x - ray luminosity in the 0.510  kev range to be @xmath26  erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "the source exhibits non - flaring variability at a level of about 20% .",
    "based on the parameters of @xcite , the bolometric luminosity of the m  dwarf is @xmath27  erg  s@xmath3 , and the ratio of x - ray to bolometric luminosity is @xmath28comparable with the canonical empirical `` saturation '' value of @xmath29 found for the most active stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and typical of the pre - cataclysmic binaries and rapidly rotating m dwarfs in the solar neighborhood studied by @xcite .    if qs  vir is a semi - detached system , the accretion rate obtained from the cooling flow model , @xmath30  yr@xmath3 , is among the lowest ever found for a cv .",
    "@xcite showed that approximately half of the gravitational energy of the accreting gas is liberated through optical and uv radiation in a viscously - heated accretion disk and the other half is dissipated largely in the form of x - rays in a `` boundary layer '' , where the disk material is decelerated from its keplerian velocity to the rotation velocity of the white dwarf .",
    "the expected x - ray luminosity from a disk boundary layer is then @xmath31 .",
    "using @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite , the boundary layer luminosity is @xmath34  erg  s@xmath3 , which is reasonably consistent with that observed .",
    "if the radiative dissipation of viscous heating amounts to a similar luminosity in the uv and optical , it would be inconspicuous in comparison to the white dwarf luminosity of @xmath35  erg  s@xmath3 ( @xmath36  k ; @xcite ) as expected .",
    "accreting gas could originate either from the wind of the red dwarf , or from roche lobe overflow .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite all found evidence for material within the roche lobe of the white dwarf . @xcite",
    "suggest this might be associated with an accretion stream , while @xcite favored wind accretion because photometric modeling suggested the m dwarf did not fill its roche lobe .",
    "@xcite suggested the presence of significant prominence material .",
    "an additional problem with roche lobe overflow for qs  vir is that this should lead to formation of an accretion disk . at low accretion rates",
    "a disk can be more optically - thin and still render relatively strong disk emission lines , but no observable signatures of a disk have been detected .",
    "since our observed mass accretion rate exceeds the total solar wind mass loss rate ( @xmath37 ) by an order of magnitude , one crucial question to decide between accretion mechanisms is whether the mass loss rate of the m dwarf component of qs  vir is sufficient to supply this flow through a wind alone .",
    "qs  vir is in some respects similar to the `` pre - polars''magnetic ( @xmath38 g ) pre - cvs that do not appear to fill their roche lobes yet show signs of accretion activity at low mass transfer rates .",
    "accretion on these systems is thought to be through magnetic capture of the secondary wind with a wind accretion efficiency of the order of 100%  ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "accretion rates in the range @xmath39@xmath40yr@xmath3 with no apparent dependence on orbital period or secondary spectral type have been found for several systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these rates are significantly higher than wind accretion on non - magnetic pre - cv systems where magnetic capture is not expected to operate .",
    "total mass loss rates for m dwarfs in close non - contact binaries with non - magnetic white dwarfs of @xmath41@xmath42  yr@xmath3 have been estimated based on the gravitational settling time of wind - accreted metals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite argue that the pre - polar accretion rates could provide the first realistic measurements of stellar mass loss at the cool end of the main sequence .",
    "single m dwarf mass loss rates have otherwise been notoriously difficult to pin down ; see , e.g. , @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "@xcite used astrospheric change exchange x - ray emission to place an upper limit of @xmath43  yr@xmath3 for the moderately active m5.5 dwarf proxima , while @xcite found @xmath44  yr@xmath3 from ly@xmath45 observations . both of these are reasonably consistent with the rates estimated for pre - polars .    the wind mass loss rate required to feed the observed @xmath46  yr@xmath3 accretion rate on qs  vir depends on its accretion efficiency .",
    "in absence of detailed magnetohydrodynamic accretion simulations this efficiency must be considered unknown .",
    "exploratory mhd wind models for detached pre - cv systems by @xcite find accretion efficiencies depend quite sensitively on the wd and donor magnetic field strengths and on their orbital separation .",
    "we can rule out qs  vir being a pre - polar with a strongly magnetized wd based on the absence of any zeeman broadening or splitting of the balmer lines or cyclotron emission features in the spectra illustrated by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the cores of the balmer lines in qs vir are dominated by emission , which would obscure any small zeeman splittings and defines an upper limit to the possible field strength .",
    "based on the @xmath47    width of the emission cores in the spectra illustrated in figure  1 of @xcite , and using equation  11 from @xcite for a white dwarf temperature of 14200  k @xcite , we estimate @xmath48 kg . adding some allowance for stark broadening hiding a slightly higher field , we find a conservative limit of @xmath49 mg .",
    "such a limit is also consistent with the absence of cyclotron emission features , which are prominent in pre - polars with even lower accretion rates than qs  vir ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite did find one pre - cv configuration for a wd field @xmath50 g in which the accretion rate approached 100%  of that of a single m star wind by an efficient `` siphoning '' of plasma from the hemisphere facing the wd , but this finding needs to be confirmed by more detailed simulations .",
    "the field would need to be of order @xmath51 g to capture all the wind of the m dwarf , and the accretion efficiency is then unlikely to be close to 100%  for qs  vir .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate of the pure hydrodynamic accretion efficiency can be made from the @xcite recipe @xmath52 where the wind density , @xmath53 , as a function of radial distance @xmath54 in the vicinity of the white dwarf at orbital separation , @xmath55 , for a wind mass loss rate @xmath56 at velocity @xmath57 is @xmath58 combining eqns .",
    "[ e : bondi ] and [ e : density ] , and assuming the wind velocity is approximately the escape velocity , @xmath59 , ( as is the case for the solar wind ) , the accretion rate is @xmath60 where the first term on the right is the accretion efficiency .",
    "the orbital separation , @xmath61^{1/3}$ ] , from the parameters in  [ s : obs ] is @xmath62 and the accretion efficiency is 0.09 .",
    "considering the accretion rate derived for qs  vir from the one - dimensional cooling flow model is likely a lower limit , the wind mass loss rate required to feed the accretion is then at least @xmath2  yr@xmath3an order of magnitude larger than implied for the m dwarfs of the pre - polars . for a typical velocity of 600  km  s@xmath3 ,",
    "this wind would require @xmath63%  of the stellar bolometric luminosity to drive which we consider uncomfortably high .",
    "@xcite interpreted a residual period decrease of qs vir with respect to their ephemeris solution that included a giant planet as angular momentum loss from a wind with an even higher mass loss rate of @xmath64  yr@xmath3 .",
    "massive winds , up to @xmath65  yr@xmath3 , were argued earlier by @xcite based on thermal escape arguments together with weak evidence of infrared wind free - free emission ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite predicted a similarly massive wind for the m4 dwarf v374  peg from magnetohydrodynamic modeling , with a ram pressure 5 orders of magnitude larger than the solar wind .",
    "however , such massive winds can be readily dismissed on energetic grounds . for a terminal velocity of @xmath66  km  s@xmath3 ,",
    "the kinetic power of the wind suggested by @xcite is @xmath67  erg  s@xmath3an implausibly large fraction ( 10% ) of the m dwarf luminosity .",
    "similarly , the wind of @xcite corresponds to an unphysical @xmath68  erg  s@xmath3 of kinetic energy when compared with the underlying stellar bolometric luminosity of @xmath69  erg  s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "@xcite had pointed out earlier that such massive winds would be opaque to radio emission which is commonly observed from active late - type stars , and deduced that mass loss rates can be no larger than 1 - 2 orders of magnitude above the solar rate . for qs",
    "vir , the need for such a massive wind is obviated by the additional period measurements of @xcite , who instead invoked a third body with a minimum mass of @xmath70 in an elliptical orbit , together with the activity - related quadrupole coupling mechanism of @xcite , to explain the period variations .",
    "@xcite noted evolutionary difficulties for the presence of such a body , though it and the secular period evolution are not of any obvious relevance for understanding the pre - cv evolutionary status , parameters and accretion rate of qs  vir .",
    "a further unexplored connection can not of course be ruled out .",
    "the kinetic power of the solar wind , @xmath71  erg  s@xmath3 , is similar to the mean observed radiative power of the corona ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite argued that the energy available to drive the solar wind scales with the basal open magnetic field strength . combining this with an observed , almost linear , correlation between x - ray radiance and surface magnetic flux @xcite",
    ", the expectation would be for stellar wind mass loss rate to scale with x - ray luminosity .",
    "@xcite estimated mass loss rates for a handful of different stars of different activity using astrospheric ly@xmath45 absorption , and found @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the surface x - ray flux .",
    "scaling to the observed surface x - ray flux of qs  vir yields @xmath74  yr@xmath3consistent with our estimated accretion requirement .",
    "however , there also exist no measurements for stars at the saturated activity level of qs  vir and @xcite caution against extrapolating the relation .",
    "proxima also does not support the relation , with a wind upper limit from ly@xmath45 absorption lying an order of magnitude below the predicted value .    in summary , for an assumed wind accretion efficiency of the order of 10% ,",
    "the preponderance of more direct assessments of the likely wind mass loss rates of active m dwarfs like the secondary of qs  vir , in particular those for the pre - polars , suggest it would not be sufficient to feed the observed accretion rate .",
    "an alternative to catastrophically energetic wind or accretion efficiency requirements is surface activity that does not lead to mass loss in single stars .",
    "@xcite suggested prominence activity could be responsible for material within the roche lobe of the white dwarf .",
    "such activity is stochastic and might be expected to result in highly variable x - ray emission .",
    "the x - ray luminosity found here from xmm - newton observations , @xmath75  erg  s@xmath3 , is about a factor of two lower than that measured in the rass ( @xmath76  erg  s@xmath3)perhaps suggestive of moderate accretion variability though flaring on the m dwarf can not be ruled out .    a more constant , lower lying , source is upward chromospheric spicule and mottle flow . in the solar chromosphere and transition region",
    "this flow corresponds to a mass flux two orders of magnitude larger than is launched in the solar wind ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the flow has a typical scale height of @xmath77  km and falls back to the solar surface , but might more easily succeed in escaping the roche surface of a star on the verge of roche lobe overflow to become readily unbound to the m dwarf and available to be swept up by the lobe of the white dwarf .",
    "such a mass flow source would only become available for a near lobe - filling system .",
    "following , e.g. , @xcite , the timescale for evolution through such a chromospherically - fed phase is @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the chromospheric scale height , @xmath80 the system angular momentum and @xmath81 its time derivative . for a chromospheric temperature of @xmath82",
    "k , the ratio @xmath83 , though for spicules this height is an order of magnitude greater . adopting the @xcite - based @xcite spin - down prescription modified by @xcite @xmath84 with @xmath85 and where @xmath86 we find a timescale @xmath87  yr for the chromospheric scale height and @xmath88  yr for spicules .",
    "the implication of this short timescale is that chromospheric mass supply would occur only in a rare , fleeting episode of evolution .",
    "x - ray spectrophotometry of qs  vir betrays ongoing accretion at a rate of @xmath46  yr@xmath3 .",
    "the slow rotation of the white dwarf diagnosed by @xcite argues against a hibernating system , and qs  vir is most likely at the first onset of significant accretion .",
    "qs  vir then represents a valuable object to probe the very earliest stages of cv evolution . at face value ,",
    "the observed accretion rate implies roche lobe overflow and a semi - detached system . a pure wind accretion alternative would imply a wind mass loss rate of @xmath2  yr@xmath3 for a bondi - hoyle accretion efficiency of 10% . for",
    "a typical velocity of 600  km  s@xmath3 , this wind would require 1%  of the stellar bolometric luminosity to drive .",
    "while plausible , we consider such a massive and energetic wind unlikely .",
    "if qs  vir is still detached , as the analysis of @xcite implies , accreted mass could be supplied by prominence activity @xcite , though such stochastic activity would likely lead to highly variable x - ray emission .",
    "the x - ray luminosity observed by xmm - newton is a factor of two lower than that seen in the rass and weakly supports this idea .",
    "we further speculate here that upward chromospheric mass flow analogous to solar spicules and mottles that escapes the roche surface to be swept up by the white dwarf would present a more constant mass supply .",
    "such a supply would become available for about million years or so prior to roche lobe overflow and qs  vir would then be in a very interesting , fleeting evolutionary phase .",
