    "+ classically , these sums have been investigated over the set of primes . for a prime @xmath6",
    ", one has , by a classical theorem of sali , that    @xmath7    from the equidistribution of roots of quadratic congruences modulo prime moduli ( proved in @xcite ) and from , follows that the angles of sali sums @xmath8 are equidistributed with respect to the uniform measure .",
    "+ in this paper , we investigate the distribution of the sums @xmath9 , when @xmath0 runs over the set of integers . individually",

    "one can generalize to any modulus @xmath0 and show that sali sums satisfy the individual bound    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the number of distinct prime divisors of @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , as for most of ( complete ) exponential sums , the understanding of the behavior of these sums as function of the moduli @xmath0 is a difficult problem . using methods of analytic number theory , one might expect to catch important properties of sali sums by looking at their @xmath12-function , but it turns out that , due to a twisted multiplicativity , the @xmath12-function has neither a functional equation nor an euler product , rendering the investigation of sali sums very involved .",
    "+ one way these sums can be approached is by the analytic theory of automorphic forms .",
    "it is known that kloosterman sums ( or their twists ) appear as fourier coefficients of poincar series . in 1987 , in his breakthrough paper @xcite , iwaniec succeded in proving a new upper bound for the fourier coefficients of modular forms of half - interal weight , by estimating sums on sali sums .",
    "this leads naturally to the problem of studying sali sums on average , and more precisely to detect cancellation among these sums .",
    "inspired by the work of livn and patterson @xcite , where the authors study the first moment of cubic exponential sums , we obtain a complete determination of the first moment of sali sums over arithmetic progressions . a crucial point for us",
    "is that the @xmath12-function associated to sali sums possesses an _ exceptional pole _ ,",
    "related to the minimal eigenvalue of the laplacian operator .",

    "one of the principal consequences of our main theorem is that , in most cases , the sali sums @xmath9 exhibit much cancellation and that , in the remaining cases , our formula shows a definitive bias for the sali sums to being positive . .",

    "the spectral side of the trace formula is more subtle to handle .",

    "this result then allows us to finally obtain an explicit expression for the spectral side of the trace formula .    in principle , theorem[mod : thm ] could be used to complete a result of blomer in @xcite .",
