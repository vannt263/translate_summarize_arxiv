    "the goal of the rosat deep survey ( rds ) is to obtain information about the luminosity functions of various types of x - ray sources as well as their evolution with redshift , and to understand the origin of the x - ray background ( xrb ) discovered more than thirty years ago ( giacconi et al .",
    "the survey was conducted in the _ lockman _ field ( hasinger et al .",
    "1993 ) , which has a minimum of galactic hydrogen column density ( lockman et al .",
    "the survey consists of exposures totaling 207 ksec with the rosat pspc and a raster scan of hri exposures totaling 205 ksec .",
    "in addition , we have a series of hri exposures of a fixed area within the pspc field with a total exposure of 1112 ksec , which allows us to derive improved positions for pspc sources detected in the area .",
    "the extraction of the x - ray sources and the derivation of the limiting x - ray flux of detection and other x - ray properties are presented in paper i ( hasinger et al .",
    "radio observations of the _ lockman _ field have been published by de ruiter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "this paper presents the optical observations made in the _ lockman _ field . these consist of ccd imaging of the field and spectroscopic observations of optical objects close to the position of the x - ray sources .",
    "section 2 covers the ccd imaging , the extraction of the optical objects , their positions and magnitudes . in sect .",
    "3 , we discuss the spectroscopic observations of optical candidates for identification with the x - ray sources . on the basis of these observations and the x - ray properties , we obtain optical identifications and classifications for almost all of the x - ray sources , cf . sect .",
    "4 . in sect . 5",
    ", we compare our results to those of other surveys made with rosat and in sect .",
    "6 we summarize the results . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use @xmath4 50 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 and @xmath5 0.5 .",
    "as described below , we carried out imaging observations of the field at mauna kea and at palomar .",
    "efforts to observe the field at kitt peak national observatory were unsuccessful due to weather .",
    "images of the _ lockman _ field were obtained on 16 - 19 january , 1988 with the university of hawaii 2.2-m telescope .",
    "the detector was an 800x800 thinned texas instruments ccd obtained from the nsf distribution .",
    "a focal reducer in the cassegrain camera produced an image scale of @xmath6 per pixel ; the field of view was @xmath7 on a side .",
    "a mosaic of 50 frames was taken through b and r filters on the kron - cousins system to cover most of the area in the inner @xmath8 of the pspc field .",
    "exposure times were 10 min .",
    "for the @xmath9 filter , and 4 min . for @xmath10 .",
    "photometric calibration was provided each night by several observations of the m67 asterism ( chevalier & ilovaisky 1991 ) .",
    "typical seeing for the nights ranged between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the focas image processing system ( valdes 1982 ) was used for processing the images and to produce total magnitudes and morphological classes .",
    "the magnitude limits were around 24.5 in @xmath9 and 23.5 in @xmath10 .",
    "drift scans of the _ lockman _ field through two filters were obtained on march 29 , 1989 with the 4-shooter camera ( gunn et al .",
    "1987 ) at the cassegrain focus of the 5-m hale telescope .",
    "the detectors are four 800 x 800 texas instrument ccds covering a net field of @xmath13 on a side with an image scale of @xmath14 per pixel .",
    "the four ccds image a contiguous 2 x 2 matrix of sky and the chips are oriented such that the readout directions of each detector are parallel . during the observations ,",
    "the instrument was rotated such that the ccd columns were oriented north - south .",
    "each drift scan was started by pointing the telescope at a position just south of the _ lockman _ field , and then driving the telescope north accross the field at a rate of @xmath15 per min .",
    "the leading ccds recorded the sky through the wide @xmath16 @xmath17 filters employed in the hst wide field / planetary camera ( cf .",
    "mackenty et al . 1992 ) , while near - infrared filters ( @xmath18 ; mackenty et al . 1992 ) were placed in front of the trailing chips .",
    "the system response curves for these filters as well as the photometric properties are given in postman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "the ccds were operated in time - delay - and - integrate ( tdi ) mode at a rate corresponding to the drift scan , resulting in an effective exposure of 293 s through each of the two filters . except for the  @xmath19  @xmath20 gaps in the center of each scan caused by the 4-shooter beam - splitter ,",
    "the entire field was covered with five drift scans whose centers were separated by 1.0 min in right ascension .",
    "the seeing fwhm was approximately @xmath21 .",
    "the initial processing of the drift scans followed the procedure described in schneider et al .",
    "the scans were divided into a series of 816x800 images , with an 80 pixel overlap in the scan direction so every object of interest would be entirely contained in one frame .",
    "a bias level , calculated from the extended registers stored in the data , was subtracted from each frame , and a one - dimensional flat field was calculated for each detector by median filtering the data .",
    "temporal variations in sky brightness , which appear as a change in background level in the scan direction , were removed from each frame by fitting third - order polynomials to the data .",
    "optical images were detected using the midas package `` inventory '' .",
    "the @xmath22 magnitude limit was around 23.5 in @xmath16 and 22.5 in @xmath23 .",
    "the object positions were corrected for overall systematic position errors along and accross the scan path using the skicat scans of the poss - ii schmidt plates ( weir et al .",
    "we estimate the astrometric accuracy to be better than 0.5@xmath24 .",
    "given the accuracy of the pspc positions , which were the basis for the early phase of the identifications , and guided by the simulations described in paper i , we considered any optical object within @xmath25 from the position of the x - ray source as a potential identification .",
    "we named optical objects near the x - ray position a , b ,  , usually in order of increasing distance from the x - ray position . in a few cases , the x - ray position moved in subsequent analyses based on additional x - ray exposures , and optical objects farther in the alphabet became involved . for each x - ray source ,",
    "spectra were obtained of optical candidates , more or less in order of brightness , until a probable identification was made ( cf .",

    ", in prep . ) .",
    "optical spectra for some of the brighter objects were obtained in february and december , 1992 with the 4-shooter spectrograph ( gunn et al .",
    "1987 ) at the 5-m hale telescope .",
    "the spectrograph s entrance aperture is a 1.5 x 100 @xmath24 slit and the detector an 800 x 800 texas instruments ccd . a 200 line mm@xmath3 transmission grating produces spectra from 4500 - 9500  at a spectral resolution of 25 .",
    "the data were processed using the procedure given in schneider et al .",
    "several of the approx .",
    "20 spectra taken showed that the objects were active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , which at the time provided assurance that the celestial positions of the x - ray objects were approximately correct .",
    "spectra for most of these objects were subsequently obtained with the keck telescope ( see below ) . for 10 objects ( 8b , 28b , 16a , 62a , 20a ,",

    "we show in fig .",
    "1 keck lris spectra illustrating the various i d classes discussed below .",
    "the i d classes @xmath38 are all based on the detection of broad emission lines that are characteristic of agns .",

    "all of the 21 are classified as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "i d class @xmath56 is assigned to 7 objects that show broad mgii emission lines and i d class @xmath57 to 3 objects that exhibit broad emission from h@xmath58 ( 16a ) or h@xmath55 ( 28b , 59a ) . among the class @xmath56 objects , three ( 56d , 37a , and 9a ) also show broad h@xmath58 emission .    in all these cases ,",
    "we believe that the object is an agn . and since agn are both rare and generally strong x - ray sources , we consider the optical object to be the identification of the x - ray source .",
    "this procedure may of course produce field agns that are not responsible for the x - ray emission .",
    "we estimate the number of such misidentifications as follows .",
    "the surface density of broad - line agns with @xmath59 is around 115 deg@xmath60 ( zitelli et al .",
    "this includes both quasars ( @xmath61 ) and seyfert galaxies ( @xmath62 ) . extrapolating the observed counts to fainter magnitudes with a slope similar to that observed in the range @xmath63 , a total surface density of @xmath64 agns",
    "deg@xmath60 has been estimated at @xmath65 ( zamorani 1995 ) . for a @xmath50 power law",
    ", @xmath66 corresponds to @xmath67 , which is approximately the faint limit of the identifications listed in table 1 . for a surface density of 365 deg@xmath60 ,",
    "the number of field agns expected in 50 circles of radius @xmath25 is @xmath68 .",
    "we use i d class @xmath39 to cover objects that do not exhibit the emission features shown in i d classes @xmath38 , but that show ne emission lines .",
    "four objects ( 12a , 117q , 51d , and 51l ) exhibit [ nev ] @xmath693426 emission .",
    "since the ionization potential of ne@xmath70 is 97 ev , corresponding to soft x - ray emission , the presence of [ nev ] emission essentially confirms the optical identification of the x - ray source .",
    "( among the objects of i d class @xmath38 discussed above , we see [ nev ] emission in the spectra of four of them . ) with the identification of the optical object confirmed and therefore the redshift of the x - ray source established , we find that the x - ray luminosity of all four sources is above @xmath71 erg s@xmath3 , far higher than that of galaxies , and we conclude that they are agns .",
    "two objects ( 26a and 45z ) show relatively strong [ neiii ] @xmath693869 emission .",
    "this feature , although seen also in field galaxies with emission lines ( cf .",
    "hammer et al .",
    "1997 ) , is typically stronger in the spectra of quasars and seyfert galaxies . among the 10 agns of i",
    "d class @xmath38 in which the [ neiii ] emission is in the accessible spectral range , we see it in 7 cases . in all cases where we see [ nev ] emission , we also observe [ neiii ] if it is accessible .",
    "object 26a also exhibits feii @xmath692600 absorption , which has been seen in spectra of broad absorption line quasars ( becker et al .",
    "we accept the two objects as the optical identifications , and then ( as for the [ nev ] cases above ) from the redshifts and the x - ray luminosities conclude that the objects are agns .      in i",
    "d class @xmath40 , we discuss the remaining objects that have galaxy counterparts without broad emission lines and without rare spectral features such as ne emission lines .",
    "we have 10 objects with i d class @xmath40 in table 1 , of which four exhibit [ oii ] emission .",
    "claims have been made ( griffiths et al .",
    "1996 , mchardy et al . 1997 ) that a significant fraction of the weaker x - ray sources are narrow - emission line galaxies ( nelg ) , characteristically showing strong [ oii ] @xmath693727 emission , and that these constitute a new population of x - ray sources .",
    "recent galaxy surveys have revealed that a large fraction of faint field galaxies show [ oii ] emission ( cf .",
    "hammer et al .",
    "our own spectral work at palomar and keck has recorded spectra of 24 galaxies near the objects listed in table 1 that have redshifts different from the optical identifications . among these field galaxies ,",
    "19 exhibit [ oii ] emission , i.e. , 79% of field galaxies are nelgs .",
    "the detection of a nelg can therefore not be taken as evidence for the correct identification of an x - ray source .",
    "since the optical spectra of possible x - ray counterparts in i d class @xmath40 are undistinguished , we introduce two additional criteria by which to identify and classify the objects .",
    "the first criterion is the ratio of x - ray and optical flux @xmath41 which is independent of distance ( cf .",
    "stocke et al .",
    "1991 ) . in fig .",
    "2 , we plot @xmath31 vs. the flux @xmath72 for the 37 agns of i d class @xmath73 that we have identified so far , and for all agns and galaxies in the extended medium - sensitivity survey ( emss , stocke et al .",
    "stocke et al .",
    "noted that essentially all agns in the emss are in the range @xmath74 . among the 37 lockman agns plotted",
    ", 36 have @xmath75 .",
    "there is no evidence from fig . 2 for evolution of the @xmath41 ratio of agns",
    "; for galaxies no or little effect of evolution would be expected given their relatively small redshifts .",
    "the second criterion we considered is the angular extent of the x - ray emission .",
    "a rigorous determination of the x - ray extent for all sources has not been part of our analysis scheme because it breaks down in the presence of significant confusion ( see paper i ) .",
    "therefore the extent has been estimated _ a posteriori _ for the objects in question by fitting a two - dimensional gaussian to the hri and pspc images and comparing this to other nearby x - ray sources .",
    "sizes are given in fwhm , approximately corrected for the size of the psf .",
    "if a faint object is extended , it may be missed by the hri observations , which are less sensitive for low surface brightness emission . on the other hand",
    ", the hri may pick up some sharper structure within diffuse emission . because of its softer response it is actually more sensitive to detect cooling flows . as noted before , optical galaxies in x - ray emitting poor groups",
    "would often be seen at positions outside the x - ray error circle . for an extended x - ray source",
    "we consider the detection of two or more galaxies at the same redshift as supporting the group identification .    in summary ,",
    "while the x - ray emission from agns and single galaxies should be point - like and centered on the optical counterpart , clusters and groups of galaxies may have extended x - ray emission ( and therefore reduced hri fluxes relative to pspc fluxes ) , that is displaced from one or more galaxies .",
    "the discussion given below for each of the sources takes into account these additional criteria in order to illuminate whether it is more likely to be an agn , a group of galaxies or something else .",
    "object 41 is extended by about 22@xmath24 in both directions on the 1112 ksec hri exposure and by 50@xmath24 in the pspc exposure .",
    "optically , a dense group of galaxies is visible , of which 41c is the brightest member .",
    "several other galaxies are at the same redshift as 41c .",
    "we classify the object as a group of galaxies , although it could be a cluster .",
    "object 48 is not extended in the pspc exposure .",

    "two other galaxies , at 9@xmath24 and 85@xmath24 from the x - ray source , have the same redshift as 48b .",
    "the object has a high @xmath42 ratio . considering the excellent coincidence of the optical and the hri position and the absence of evidence for an extent in x - rays , we consider 48b to be the optical identification . on the basis of its x - ray luminosity and @xmath41 ratio",
    ", we classify this object as an agn , although this classification has to be considered uncertain .",
    "object 27 is a complex case .",
    "the pspc x - ray position is consistent with that of the optical quasar 27a .",
    "early parts of the 1112 ksec hri exposure show a source 10@xmath24 se of 27a but the more recent hri exposures produce a source position less than 1@xmath24 from 27a . apparently , there are two variable sources involved .",
    "since the survey is defined by the epoch of the pspc observations , we identify the x - ray source with 27a .",
    "object 67 appears complex in the pspc image .",
    "it is near the edge of the field , at 17@xmath767 from the center .",
    "it is barely detected on the hri raster scan , suggesting a substantial extension in x - rays .",
    "the galaxy 67b has @xmath42=-0.48 .",
    "three other galaxies in the error box have the same redshift as 67b .",
    "we classify the object as a group .",
    "object 36 is another case where variability plays a role .",
    "the source 36 is based on the pspc exposures .",
    "the deep hri survey shows an x - ray source ( designated as number 870 ) about 15@xmath24 to the south of 36 . near this position",

    "however , the hri raster scan , which only recently produced accurate positions after an astrometrical solution provided by the ultradeep hri pointing ( see paper i ) , clearly confirms the pspc position and does not show an object near 36f .",
    "it thus appears that there are two x - ray sources and that 36f is strongly variable .",

    "1997 )    we list in table 2 the properties of the surveys ( the present survey is denoted as rds ) , as well as the fractions identified as agns and galaxies . in general , the area covered by a given survey varies with limiting flux .",
    "the limiting fluxes @xmath97 given in table 2 are those mentioned in the quoted references and generally refer to the weakest x - ray sources in the sample .",
    "the fraction of sources identified as agns in the rds is larger than that in all other surveys .",
    "this is partly due to the high quality of the keck lris spectra and partly due to our classification procedure . in particular , we have used evidence based on the presence of [ nev ] or [ neiii ] emission , together with the high x - ray luminosity to classify 6 objects ( 12% ) as agns that otherwise might have been classified as galaxies .",
    "we can carry out a direct comparison of the rds with the two shallower surveys . based on the crss agn and galaxy percentages",
    ", we would expect to find among the 11 rds sources above @xmath98 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 six agns and one galaxy , whereas we observe eight agns and no galaxies .",
    "similarly , based on the nep agn percentage , we would expect in the rds above @xmath47 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 20 agns , whereas we observe 25 .",
    "we conclude that the percentages of agn and galaxies for the crss , the nep and the rds are not significantly different .",
    "the drs and the ukds have lower quoted limiting fluxes than the rds , even though their exposure times are shorter . given the simulations discussed in paper i",
    ", this raises concerns about the effects of confusion .",
    "we show in table 2 the three f - factors derived from simulations relevant to the different surveys , as described in paper i. the contamination factor @xmath99 represents the fraction of output sources that have a flux in excess of 1.5 times the nearest input source ( if within 15 ) augmented by 3@xmath100 . in practice , more than half the photons of these output sources",
    "did not originate from the nearby input source .",
    "the loss factor @xmath101 is the fraction of input sources that do not have an output source within @xmath102 .",
    "these input sources are not detected at all or have lost their identity and in practice can not be optically identified .",
    "the factor @xmath103 is the fraction of output sources that has no input source within 15 .",
    "it therefore represents the unidentifiable fraction of the detected sources .",
    "the loss factors @xmath101 for the drs and the ukds show that 38 and 41% , respectively , of the input sources ( i.e. , the real sources in the field ) are lost .",
    "in contrast , the nep and the rds lose only 4 and 8% of the input sources .",
    "actually , since in the rds the 1112 ksec hri survey covers about 2/3 of the @xmath104 pspc field , the effective values of @xmath99 and @xmath101 are less than those given in table 2 .    among the sources that are detected",
    ", the factor @xmath103 for the ukds suggests that 26% should be unidentifiable .",
    "mchardy et al . (",
    "1997 ) state that 11 out of 70 sources , or 16% , are unidentified .",
    "the discrepancy between these two percentages raises the question whether some of the unidentifiable sources in the ukds may have been identified incorrectly .",
    "we suspect that this is the case , and that the misidentifications involve the nelgs which are claimed to be a new population of x - ray sources ( griffiths et al .",
    "1996 , mchardy et al .",
    "1997 ) . as discussed in sect .",
    "4.3 , nelgs make up such a large fraction of faint field galaxies that the presence of a nelg in the x - ray error circle can not be taken to confirm its identification of the x - ray source .",
    "our procedure to identify and classify the weak x - ray sources in the rds depends on the angular extent of the object . for stars and agns ( cf .",
    "i d classes @xmath73 ) which are point sources both in x - rays and optically , we require positional agreement between the x - ray and the optical source . as can be seen for the objects of i d class @xmath73 in table 1 , the average offset between x - ray and optical positions is @xmath105 for pspc positions and less than @xmath20 for hri positions .",
    "identifications are based , first on the presence of broad emission lines , second on the combination of the presence of [ nev ] emission and high x - ray luminosity , and third on the presence of relatively strong [ neiii ] emission .",
    "we argue that the presence of one or more broad emission lines in the spectrum of an optical object near the x - ray source signifies an agn , and that these are sufficiently rare that this essentially confirms the identication .",
    "the presence of [ nev ] is taken to be indicative of soft x - ray emission , confirming the optical object as the identification of the x - ray source , and the high x - ray luminosity derived from the redshift signifies an agn .",
    "given the rare ocurrence of strong [ neiii ] emission , its presence is also considered to confirm the identification .",
    "for the remaining 10 objects , of i d class @xmath40 , the identification procedure is quite different .",
    "many of these objects have extended x - ray emission and some have a low hri flux or a positional offset between hri and pspc .",
    "x - ray variability is seen in two cases , complicating the identification procedure . generally , the ratio @xmath41 is fairly large , suggesting that the object is an agn or a group or cluster of galaxies .",
    "we take evidence for x - ray source extension and the presence of several galaxies at the same redshift as suggestive of identification with a group of galaxies , even though we have not systematically explored galaxies near the x - ray source .",
    "applying these classification rules , we find 39 agns , 3 groups of galaxies , 1 galaxy and 3 stars . among the agns ,",
    "16 have @xmath106 , corresponding to @xmath61 which according to the luminosity criterion of schmidt & green ( 1983 ) would qualify them as quasars , while the other 23 agns according to their optical luminosities are seyfert galaxies . among the four sources that remain unidentified , the observations for object 36 are not complete , while source 116 is most likely a group of galaxies .",
    "the most intriguing x - ray sources are objects 14 and 84 , for which there is no evidence for source extension and where the ratio @xmath107 , larger than any shown in fig .  2 .",
    "however , if these sources have modest extension that could have remained undetected so far , they could still be groups of galaxies , as discussed in sect .",
    "roche et al . ( 1995 ) , shanks et al . ( 1996 ) and almaini et al .",
    "( 1997 ) find evidence for a significant cross - correlation between @xmath108 galaxies and weak unidentified x - ray sources .",
    "almaini et al .",
    "find that @xmath108 galaxies account for 23% of the x - ray background at 1 kev .",
    "this finding is qualitatively consistent with the substantial fraction of agns which are morphologically classified as galaxies in our survey ( see table 1 ) .",
    "further analysis is required to understand the relationship between these results in detail .",
    "the fraction of x - ray sources with reliable optical identifications and redshifts in the rds is higher than that in any previously published x - ray survey .",
    "this is a consequence of the realistic x - ray flux limits we used based on simulations , the role of deep hri exposures for many of the sources in the central part of the pspc field and the high quality of most of the keck spectra obtained with lris . while the survey is based on sources selected above given flux limits based on pspc exposures , the effect of the subsequent hri imaging was considerable . in the early phase of the identification work ,",
    "x - ray positions were based on pspc images . in most cases , the identifications obtained",
    "were confirmed later by the much more accurate hri positions . in two cases ,",
    "the hri managed to resolve confusion in the pspc image , resulting in each case in an object pair , 37a+37 g and 51d+51l , respectively .",
    "the hri exposures also played a significant role in the realization that a number of x - ray sources are not associated with single objects but rather are possible groups of galaxies ( e.g. , object 58 ) , either by directly confirming their extent or showing an offset between x - ray and optical positions .",
    "we discuss claims in the literature for the appearance of a new population of weak x - ray sources in the form of narrow - emission line galaxies ( nelg ) .",
    "we note that these claims are made on the basis of surveys that according to our simulations are strongly affected by confusion , leading to a substantial number of detected sources that are unidentifiable . given that a large percentage of faint field galaxies are actually nelgs , we suggest that some of the unidentifiable sources identified as nelg are field galaxies that have no relation to the x - ray source .",
    "we do not claim that there can not exist a new population among the weaker x - ray sources .",
    "given the natural uncertainties that accompany the identification of objects of i d class @xmath40 , such a new population could only be found in surveys with conservative flux limits in which confusion plays a minor role .",
