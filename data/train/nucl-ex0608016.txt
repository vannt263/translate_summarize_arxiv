    "beams of radioactive nuclides can be produced in several ways .",
    "various strategies have been explored extensively , in particular as starting points for the next generation of large scale radioactive beam facilities such as fair @xcite , ria @xcite and spiral ii @xcite .",
    "a special case is the production of nuclides that can be reached in simple `` rearrangement reactions '' , such as charge exchange reactions , e.g. ( p , n ) reactions , and stripping reactions , e.g. ( d , p ) and ( d , n ) reactions . by inverting the kinematics of the reactions , i.e. using a light particle target ( h@xmath0 , d@xmath0 , @xmath1he ) and a heavy - ion beam ,",
    "secondary beams can be obtained with considerable intensity and favorable emittance .",
    "such beams have been succesfully exploited , for example at argonne national laboratories @xcite for astrophysical studies . at the cyclotron institute of texas a&m",
    "the inverse reaction technique is used at the mars spectrometer @xcite for @xmath2-decay studies . for the tri@xmath3p facility at kvi groningen , netherlands",
    ", these secondary beams will be used to study fundamental symmetries and interactions via @xmath2-decay of light nuclei @xcite .",
    "recently , one key part of the facility , the tri@xmath3p separator , has become operational @xcite .",
    "the tri@xmath3p separator consists of two dipole sections .",
    "the first one separates the primary and secondary beam , with the secondary beam dispersed in the intermediate focal plane .",
    "the second section brings the secondary beam back to an achromatic focus at the exit of the separator .",
    "one can add an absorber in the intermediate plane , which allows one to remove unwanted products that are produced with the same rigidity as the desired secondary beam . in this sense",
    "the tri@xmath3p separator is like the magnetic separators used for fragmentation reactions @xcite . in combination with reactions in inverse kinematics clean and intense beams can be obtained with such separators .",
    "intensity limitations arise from the separator acceptance both in momentum and angle .    in this article",
    "we explore in which way we can minimize the impact of the separator acceptance . in particular , whether to choose low or high energy beams .",
    "the various concepts to exploit inverted reaction kinematics were tested experimentally .",
    "the methods were applied already in the implantation of radioactive nuclides in si detectors , to study @xmath2-decay for fundamental and astrophysical research @xcite .",
    "first we consider the momentum and angular acceptance . for the purpose of our discussion",
    "it is sufficient to use non - relativistic kinematics .",
    "the maximal variation in momentum , @xmath4 of the projectile - like particle produced in a binary reaction is ( see figure [ fig : vector ] ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the momentum associated with the center - of - mass motion and @xmath7 is the recoil momentum in the center of mass . the projectile - like particles are emitted within a cone of @xmath8    thus @xmath9 . in terms of masses of the projectile ( @xmath10 ) ,",
    "target ( @xmath11 ) , projectile - like particle ( @xmath12 ) , and target - like particle ( @xmath13 ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the energy excess ( q - value ) of the reaction and @xmath16 is the center - of - mass energy .",
    "thus in reactions where @xmath17 .",
    "another important result of equation ( [ dppq ] ) is that reactions with a large negative q - value will have small emittance .",
    "moreover , when @xmath18 is much larger than the coulomb barrier in the entrance channel , the reaction cross section nearly always peaks at threshold , mostly because the reaction typically proceeds via a resonant state in the compound nucleus .",
    "next we consider the angular distribution .",
    "we can write @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the center - of - mass angle and @xmath21 the laboratory momentum of the projectile - like particle . when the center - of - mass angular distribution @xmath22 is isotropic the resulting momentum distribution is box shaped , i.e. @xmath23 when the angular distribution approaches a @xmath24 dependence , singularities appear in the momentum distribution at the limits @xmath25 .",
    "for the production technique using inverse reactions a gas target is essential . at high beam intensities",
    "a solid or liquid target of e.g. hydrogen would dissipate so much heat locally that it would go into the gas phase . also , a solid target with hydrogen , like polyethylene , would loose rapidly its hydrogen content .",
    "the target for the tri@xmath3p facility is based on a design from texas a&m @xcite and has been built at north carolina state university @xcite .",
    "the target has been used so far with 1 bar of h@xmath0 and with d@xmath0 .",
    "it is kept at liquid nitrogen temperature in a 10  cm long volume closed by windows of 5  @xmath3 m havar of 1  cm diameter .",
    "the resulting target thickness is 3.2 mg/@xmath26 for h@xmath0 .",
    "the beam diameter at the target position is typically 2 - 3 mm .",
    "a schematic drawing of the target configuration is shown in figure [ gastarget ] .",
    "+    the target can be moved remotely to allow the use of other targets ( e.g. a viewing target ) .",
    "the target is electrically isolated to allow target - current read - out .",
    "the liquid - nitrogen dewar is automatically filled .",
    "the target has been operated successfully in all experiments so far , without replacing the windows .",
    "we have measured @xmath27 for a number of reactions . here",
    "we discuss results for the reaction p(@xmath28ne,@xmath28na)n at 22.3 mev / nucleon ( @xmath29 mev ) with a q - value of -14.7 mev .",
    "the average center - of - mass energy correcting for various energy losses is 20.7  mev .",
    "this implies for this reaction that on average @xmath30  mrad and @xmath31  % , cf .",
    "equation ( [ dth ] ) .",
    "the emittance is thus close to the acceptance of the separator , which is 60 mrad and 4% in angle and momentum , respectively .",
    "had the q - value been zero the emittance would have been @xmath32 or 100 mrad and 10% , respectively , i.e. 60% larger than for the actual q - values .",
    "this illustrates the effect of the large negative q - value .    to measure @xmath27",
    "we scanned the rigidity of the separator , using a si detector with a 2 cm diameter in the intermediate focal plane of the device .",
    "two scans were performed : one with the full angular opening and one with the angular acceptance restricted to 32 mrad . in figure",
    "[ fig : dsdp ] we show the measured @xmath27 for these two acceptances .",
    "na yield for two angular openings of the separator .",
    "the filled circles correspond to an angular opening of 32 mrad and the filled squares to the maximum angular opening of 60 mrad .",
    "the histograms show the result of monte carlo simulations assuming isotropic emission .",
    "the full and dashed histogram refer to the small and large opening respectively .",
    "the relative normalization of the two data sets is uncertain due to systematic errors of about 20% .",
    "_ , width=377 ]    for comparison we also give the results of monte carlo simulations of an isotropic distribution that includes the effect of stopping and straggling in the target and the beam divergence .",
    "the calculations were normalized to the high momentum part of the scan with a small angular opening .",
    "systematic errors are about 20% . the data and calculations show that the momentum dependence of the yield distribution can be well understood .",
    "the differences with the data are in part due to the fact that the actual angular distribution is not isotropic @xcite and part due to the finite size of the detector .",
    "in the following we consider the effect of the angular distribution on the kinematic focusing . here",
    "we are concerned with the shape of the angular distribution and its dependence on beam energy . for ( p , n ) reactions",
    "this has been studied extensively and a parametrization of the shape of the distribution is available @xcite .",
    "the cross sections decrease approximately as @xmath33 well above threshold , while the angular distribution becomes more focused at forward angles .",
    "we will argue below in section [ thickness ] that the target thickness can be increased until the phase space of the separator is fully used , which allows one to compensate the @xmath34 dependence of the cross section .",
    "the increasing acceptance with increasing energy does not stem from the higher energy itself ( see section [ kinematics ] ) but from the fact that the angular distribution is peaked more strongly around @xmath35 . for (",
    "p , n ) reactions this can be shown explicitly . here",
    "the angular distribution depends on the momentum transfer , @xmath36 , with k the beam momentum per nucleon .",
    "the cross section is approximated by @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mean square radius of the projectile .",
    "the main point is that the cross section only depends on the momentum transfer and that this holds at least qualitatively over a large energy range . with this assumption",
    "the secondary beam emittance decreases as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is determined by @xmath41 . for other direct reactions",
    "a qualitatively similar emmitance decrease with beam energy can be safely assumed .",
    "the measured differential distribution of the yield as function of the rigidity of the separator is @xmath42 where the last proportionality is only valid for ( p , n ) reactions .",
    "ne,@xmath43na)n at 43 mev / nucleon and d(@xmath28ne,@xmath43na)n at 22.3 mev / nucleon .",
    "the result for the first reaction is indicated by the filled circles .",
    "the dotted line through the sharp rising part of the distribution is a fit using equation ( [ dsdq ] ) .",
    "the filled squares give the distribution of the stripping reaction ; the dashed line connecting these data points is to guide eye .",
    "_ , title=\"fig:\",width=377 ] +    we have measured the momentum dependence for two typical reactions , the reaction p(@xmath43ne,@xmath43na)n at 43 mev / nucleon and the reaction d(@xmath28ne,@xmath43na)n at 22.3 mev / nucleon .",
    "the q - value for these reactions are -4.3 and 0.2 mev , respectively , i.e. both reactions are well above threshold . the first reaction has high yields because @xmath43ne and @xmath43na are mirror nuclei . the production using the stripping reaction proceeds preferentially via states with strong single particle nature .",
    "terakawa et al .",
    "@xcite found the largest population in the first excited state of @xmath43na which corresponds to the @xmath44 state .",
    "the measured momentum distributions are presented in fig .",
    "[ direct ] .",
    "they were obtained in the same setup as described above .",
    "the strong forward focus is very prominent in both reactions .",
    "the main yield is in a momentum range of only 1 to 2 % .",
    "for the ( p , n ) reaction the rising yield has been fitted with equation ( [ dsdq ] ) using @xmath45 as a free parameter .",
    "a reduced radius @xmath46 fm was found , which is a satisfactory result in view of the approximations and the experimental method .",
    "the shape of the low yield tail for this reaction is due to the combined effect of the changing acceptance of the separator on one hand , and the characteristic oscillations in the angular distributions at large angle on the other .",
    "also the stripping reaction shows a steep fall . in this case",
    ", however , the energy straggling defines most of the shape of the distribution .",
    "the window for the angular distribution extends only up to @xmath47 in the center of mass .",
    "nonetheless , it exhausts a large fraction of the total yield as can be inferred from ref .",
    "@xcite , which reports on angular distribution measurements at the much lower energy of 12.5 mev / nucleon .",
    "the yield in inverse kinematics can be maximized by increasing the target thickness . however , at some point the added production will fall outside the acceptance of the separator .",
    "one of the important parameters is the stopping power . because both beam and product are slowed down , only the difference in stopping power needs to be considered .",
    "one has exhausted the acceptance of the magnetic separator when the thickness @xmath48 leads to a differential energy loss @xmath49 that is larger than the energy acceptance of the separator . in equation  ( [ diffstop ] ) we have used the @xmath50 dependence of the stopping power @xmath51 . note that the entrance and exit windows play no role .",
    "however , the amount of angular and energy straggling , of course , does increase with the amount of material .    integrating over the momentum dependence in equation ( [ cross section ] ) one obtains @xmath52}\\frac{\\sigma_o}{\\mu^2\\langle      r^2\\rangle\\epsilon}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the reduced mass in a.m.u . and @xmath53 is the beam energy per nucleon .",
    "the maximum yield is then @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the beam current and @xmath56 is the energy acceptance of the separator ( 8% for the tri@xmath3p separator ) . in the denominator of this equation",
    "the compensation of the energy dependence of the cross section is made explicit .",
    "moreover , the stopping power in the nominator has also a @xmath34 dependence , in this energy range .",
    "thus if a production cross section is the result of a direct reaction the highest beam energy should be considered . for a ( p , n )",
    "reaction only the constraints of the accelerator are a limiting factor .",
    "typical production rates of the ( p , n ) and ( d , p ) reactions discussed were @xmath57 and @xmath58  /s / particle - na , respectively .    using equation ( [ ymax ] ) to extrapolate towards higher yields we find that increasing the target pressure 10-fold , eliminating current constraints on the separator acceptance , and considering the foreseen upgrade in beam current , a production rate of @xmath59 radioactive particles / s can be reached with the tri@xmath3p separator in selected reactions",
    "we have considered two methods to produce efficiently a secondary beam of radioactive particles .",
    "the methods are based on using a light target and heavy - ion beam .",
    "the first method can be used in reactions that have a large negative q - value .",
    "one can select beam energies near threshold , which results in small recoil energies , while the products remain fast enough to allow to transmit and separate them efficiently in a magnetic separator .",
    "the second method exploits the increasingly narrow angular distributions .",
    "both methods can be roughly modelled so that these models can be used to optimize the settings of the separator , using e.g. the lise code @xcite .",
    "the methods described here can be used to produce beams with rather narrow energy distributions , which can be used as a starting point for radioactive beam experiments .",
    "this work was supported by the _ rijksuniversiteit groningen _ and the _ stichting voor fundamenteel onderzoek der materie _ ( fom ) under program 48 ( tri@xmath3p ) .",
