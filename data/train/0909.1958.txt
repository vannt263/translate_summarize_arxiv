    "any measurement of a quantity @xmath1 of a quantum system has an impact on the system itself .",
    "for example , exactly determining @xmath1 implies that any knowledge of a conjugate variable is lost . moreover , the detection might even be destructive by nature , _",
    "e.g. _ the standard way of measuring the electromagnetic field is by photocounting detectors where photons are actually absorbed .",
    "however , there exist situations where a measurement of some quantity @xmath1 does not induce any back - action quantum noise on @xmath1 .",
    "that is , provided @xmath1 is a constant of motion , then a second measurement of @xmath1 , after some time - delay relative the first measurement , would reveal the same value as obtained in the first measurement .",
    "this is called a quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurement  @xcite .    by now , qnd measurements of the optical field have been demonstrated both for an optical fiber  @xcite and in cavity qed setups  @xcite . in the cavity experiments to date , an atomic ramsey interferometer technique has been utilized .",

    "determines the photon number definitely .",
    "the kinetic energy of the atoms in these experiment greatly exceeds the atom - field interaction energy , and thereby they can be safely treated by classical means . for ultracold atoms on the other hand , mechanical effects induced by the light fields become important .",
    "such actions are indeed the building blocks for cooling and trapping of neutral atoms  @xcite . in the cavity qed community",
    ", it has long been known that the atom - field dynamics may be considerably modified by treating the atomic motion quantum mechanically together with taking spatial mode variations into account  @xcite .",
    "the system now includes additional degrees of freedom that become correlated with the cavity field .",
    "already back in 1989 it was shown that deflection of a beam of ultracold atoms resonantly interacting and transversely scattered from a quantized standing wave field will depend on the actual photon distribution of the field  @xcite . for a classical field ,",
    "the same effect , named optical stern - gerlach , was presented in ref .",
    "these observations led to the idea of performing qnd measurments of the cavity field using ultracold atoms dispersively interacting with the field .",
    "reference  @xcite considered a beam of ultracold atoms transversely passing a fabry - perot cavity . in the raman - nath regime ,",
    "valid for very short interaction times , it was shown that the deflection of the atomic beam after interacting with the cavity field depends on the number of photons .",
    "thus , by recording the atomic positions of a sequence of atoms having interacted with the cavity field , a qnd measurement of the photon number is possible .    in this paper",
    "we address a different qnd measurement where the time - of - flight of the atom is recorded . instead of studying the deflection of transversely passing atoms , we consider atoms traversing the fabry - perot cavity along its axial direction .",
    "our treatment is fully quantum mechanical , taking into account for ; the atomic scattering effects occurring as the atom enters and exits the cavity , the quantum pressure arising from the atomic kinetic energy term ( hence going beyond the raman - nath regime ) , as well as the uncertainty of the velocity of the incoming atom .",
    "the scheme is first studied in a semi - analytical model which relies on the concepts of effect mass and group velocity for the atom . by imposing a sort of single - band approximation",
    ", the semi - analytical model demonstrates that a single atom is sufficient for performing the qnd measurement in the ideal situation provided the effective interaction time is long enough .",
    "the full system , going beyond single - band and taking into account for a finite cavity , is considered numerically , and it is found that typically around ten atoms is enough for achieving a highly efficient qnd measurement .",
    "we consider an ultracold two - level atom sent through a fabry - perot cavity along its axial axis .",
    "the internal ground and excited atomic states are labeled @xmath3 and @xmath2 , and their energy difference @xmath5 .",
    "the atom interacts with a single cavity mode with frequency @xmath6 . moving to an interaction frame and imposing the rotating wave approximation",

    "we further explained that even for lossy cavities the scheme is of interest as it can be used as a tool to measure the full steady state photon distribution .",
