    "due to the strong interactions among the spin , orbital , and lattice degrees of freedom , the transition metal oxides with spinel structure , @xmath9o@xmath10 , present complicated magnetic and structural phase transitions and have attracted extensive attention in past years.@xcite in the system , the octahedrally coordinated @xmath11-site cations form a geometrically frustrated network of corner shared tetrahedra , while the @xmath12-site cations form a diamond lattice and are located at the center of oxygen - tetrahedra .",
    "the 3@xmath13 orbitals of the @xmath11-site cation split into the triply degenerate low - energy @xmath14 states and doubly degenerate high - energy @xmath15 states , while the @xmath12-site cation has two low energy @xmath15 states with three high energy @xmath14 states.@xcite since the properties of both @xmath12 and @xmath11 cations are driven by the electron occupancies on 3@xmath13 orbitals , which determine the magnetic and orbital degrees of freedom , it is challenging to obtain the original driving forces for those magnetic and structural phase transitions in the spinel oxides .    in order to get insightful information on the phase transition mechanism",
    ", one can occupy the @xmath16-site with a spin only cation , ( such as the chromite spinels @xmath12cr@xmath17o@xmath10 ) .",
    "the electronic configuration for cr@xmath8 cation is 3@xmath18(@xmath19(cr@xmath8)=3/2 ) , which leads to half filled @xmath14 and empty @xmath15 orbitals . in addition , it has been found that different @xmath12-site cations could yield different ordered states : i ) if @xmath20 ions are magnetically neutral , such as zncr@xmath17o@xmath10,@xcite mgcr@xmath17o@xmath10,@xcite cdcr@xmath17o@xmath10,@xcite and hgcr@xmath17o@xmath10,@xcite a transition from the paramagnetic cubic phase to the nel - ordered tetragonal or orthorhombic one at low temperatures is obtained .",

    "iii ) if @xmath20 ions are magnetic with the orbital degree of freedom , such as fecr@xmath17o@xmath10 , @xcite nicr@xmath17o@xmath10,@xcite and cucr@xmath17o@xmath10,@xcite a cubic - tetragonal phase transition is observed at a higher temperature , followed by magnetic order , which indicates that the magnetic ordering is stabilized by reducing the lattice symmetry through a spin - lattice coupling",
    ". the long - range ordered collinear ferrimagnetic state can eventually evolve into different noncollinear ferrimagnetic states at a lower temperature , such as conical ordering in fecr@xmath17o@xmath10 and nicr@xmath17o@xmath10 , and yafet - kittel - type magnetic ordering in cucr@xmath17o@xmath10 .",
    "moreover , the multiferroic ordering and the dielectric response induced by the magnetic field also have been found in several chromium spinel oxides.@xcite substantial experimental and theoretical works have been performed to study the intriguing properties of @xmath12cr@xmath17o@xmath10 .",
    "previously , a largely separate line of research has been devoted to the spin - lattice interaction which is related to the spin frustration and the cooperative jahn - teller distortion especially for the compounds involving orbitally active @xmath12-site cations.@xcite however , very few materials have been studied from the view point of the coupling between frustration and jahn - teller effects by changing the orbital configuration of @xmath11-site cation .",
    "+    in this regard , fe@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath10 is a remarkable compound . the fe@xmath8 ions ( 3@xmath21 ) are not orbitally active and have a large spin , @xmath19 = 5/2 , while fe@xmath7 ions have an orbital degree of freedom with 3@xmath22 and @xmath19 = 2 .",
    "since the cr@xmath7 energy level lies well above the fe@xmath23 energy levels , the valence of cr@xmath8 is stable .",
    "although electrons have been reported to be hopping between @xmath12- and @xmath11-sites for @xmath5 @xmath24 @xmath25 0.8 , @xcite the cr@xmath8 ions always stay at the @xmath11-site and the only electron transfer should be between fe@xmath7 and fe@xmath8 ions .",
    "this arrangement leads to the 3@xmath13 electronic ground state of fe@xmath7 ion changing from @xmath26 on the @xmath12-site to @xmath14 on the @xmath11-site and the type of the jahn - teller distortion effect being alternated in the system.@xcite therefore , the primary effect of fe - doping in this system is to change the average moment on the @xmath11-sites and alter the competition of antiferromagnetic interactions between @xmath12-@xmath11 and @xmath11-@xmath11 .",
    "for this reason , studying the magnetic and structural lattice of fe@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath10 can help to uncover the origin of the orbital ordering effect on the structural transition .",
    "the structure was first discussed by verwey et al . in 1947,@xcite",
    "then several techniques had been applied to study the physical properties . in 1964 , g. shirane et al.@xcite measured the magnetic structures of the parent compound fecr@xmath17o@xmath10 by neutron powder diffraction ( npd ) . in 2008 , tomiyasu et al.@xcite reported the dynamical spin - frustration effect on the magnetic excitations of fecr@xmath17o@xmath10 .",
    "both composition and temperature dependences of cubic - tetragonal - orthorhombic structure transitions had been reported by x - ray powder diffraction ( xpd ) and specific heat.@xcite the magnetic properties had been studied by magnetic and mssbauer effect measurements.@xcite however , a systematic study of the doping effect on magnetic structures is still missing , and the t - x phase diagram is still under debate.@xcite    in this paper , the magnetic and crystal structure of fe@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 ( 0.2 @xmath27 1.0 ) are studied by npd , xpd , magnetic susceptibility , and specific heat measurements . the phase diagram for 0.0 @xmath27 1.0",
    "is also constructed .",
    "the measurements confirm the existence of a paramagnetic - to - collinear ferrimagnetic phase transition for the entire @xmath5 range and a conical ferrimagnetic state at low temperature in the low fe - doping region ( @xmath28 0.6 ) .",
    "the structural phase transition is complicated : although the cubic - to - tetragonal transition ( 0.0 @xmath27 0.8 ) and a short - range tetragonal distortion is suggested ( 0.8 @xmath27 1.0 ) , the related structural transition temperature ( @xmath29 ) decreases at @xmath28 0.3 , then increases gradually at 0.3 @xmath27 0.8 , and decreases again at @xmath30 0.8 .",
    "in addition , a tetragonal - to - orthorhombic transition is detected at @xmath31 and disappears at the high fe - doping region ( @xmath30 0.7 ) .",
    "we extend the study of phase diagram to compositions beyond 0.4 and temperatures below 80 k. these observations not only emphasize the competitions among the spin - lattice interaction , the jahn - teller distortion , the cooperative spin - orbital coupling , and the disordered states of the @xmath12- and @xmath11-site ions , but also reveal the effect of the magnetic moment magnitude and electron hopping on this frustrated spinel system .",
    "polycrystalline samples of fe@xmath0cr@xmath1o@xmath2 ( 0 @xmath271.0 ) were synthesized by solid state reaction .",
    "stoichiometric mixtures of fe@xmath17o@xmath32 , fe , and cr@xmath17o@xmath32 were ground together and calcined under flowing ar at 1150@xmath33c for 20 h. the magnetic susceptibility was measured with a squid ( quantum design ) with an applied field h = 100 oe with zero field(zfc ) and field cooling processes(fc ) .",

    "the powder samples were either pressed in a stainless - steel cup or solution - cast from ethanol onto an anodized flat holder , depending on the amount of material available .",
    "the instrument alignment was verified prior to the data collection using nist 660a lab@xmath35 standard , but no internal standards were used in order to prevent contamination of the samples .",
    "the cryostage was operated under a vacuum of approximately 10@xmath36 torr .",
    "data were collected over broad and limited diffraction angles in order to verify structure and to carefully examine the structural transitions over a broad temperature range from 15 to 300 k. the xpert highscore plus software was employed to identify possible phases and determine the lattice parameters .",
