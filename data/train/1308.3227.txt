    "among many different types of pulsating stars , probably the most important group are classical ( or type i ) cepheid variables .",
    "they obey a power - law period - luminosity relation , which allows measurement of distances to external galaxies .",
    "however , the details of this relation are subject of an active debate .",
    "the slope of the relation changes around a period of @xmath2 at some wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also the zero point of the relation is affected by metallicity .",
    "different star formation history in different galaxies result in different histograms of cepheid periods , which impacts the distance estimates if the period - luminosity relation is not a pure power - law .",
    "the other effects that affect the observed brightness of cepheids are : extinction , infrared emission of circumstellar dust and blending .",
    "the above problems can not be tackled without a deep understanding of the cepheid internal structure .",
    "only recently has the discrepancy of cepheid masses derived from the stellar evolution and pulsation theories been solved @xcite .    among the cepheid variables",
    "an important group constitute multimode radial pulsators .",
    "the identification of two modes with the expected period ratio clearly shows that the object is a classical cepheid , not a different type of the variable star .",
    "it also yields an additional constraint on stellar parameters as the two modes probe different parts of the star . in this context",
    "even more important are triple mode pulsators @xcite of which we know a dozen or so .",
    "the highest number of cepheids is known in the magellanic clouds .",
    "these galaxies contain altogether more than 8000 cepheids @xcite . among them",
    "@xmath3 show at least two radial modes in the small magellanic cloud . for the more metal - rich large magellanic cloud",
    "the corresponding value is @xmath4 . except these",
    ", the double mode cepheids are known only in the milky way and m33 @xcite .",
    "there are also more than 2000 cepheids known in andromeda galaxy ( m31 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and until now none of them has been claimed as a double mode pulsator . if the same single mode to double mode number ratio of cepheids is in the m31 as in magellanic clouds one would expect more than a hundred double mode cepheids to be detected by a deep enough survey .",
    "the number should be smaller because of more severe blending , which lowers the observed amplitudes of cepheids and affects most the smaller amplitude mode . even accounting for this",
    ", one would expect at least a few longest period ( i.e. , brightest ) double mode cepheids to be known in m31 .",
    "we note that three double mode rr lyr variables were found in the hubble space telescope photometry by @xcite and they are fainter than cepheids .    here",
    "we present a search for double mode cepheids in archival photometry for known variable stars in m31 .",
    "the next section briefly presents data used in the analysis .",
    "we present the search method and its results in sections  3 and 4 .",
    "finally , we discuss our findings . during our research",
    ", we found missclassifications for a few cepheids , which are presented in the appendix .",
    "our analysis is based on two sets of publicly available lightcurves for the cepheids in m31 . in their search for cepheids in m31 @xcite",
    "used data collected between 1999 and 2003 for stars in ne part of this galaxy .",
    "one field of @xmath5 was observed with 2.5  m isaac newton telescope .",
    "the pixel scale was @xmath6 and median seeing was @xmath7 in the b band and @xmath8 in the v band .",
    "the analysis , based on 265 epochs in b band and 259 in v band led to a discovery of 416 cepheids . for more details",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the second set of lightcurves was presented by @xcite .",
    "they analyzed data collected by @xmath9  m panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs ) with @xmath10 camera .",
    "the pixel scale is @xmath11 and a total field of view is @xmath12 i.e. , it allows covering the whole of m31 in a single image .",
    "the 183 epochs in @xmath13 and @xmath14 bands @xcite collected in 2010 and 2011 were used to search for cepheids .",
    "the median seeing of the 30 best seeing images was @xmath15 .",
    "altogether 2009 cepheids were found including type ii objects and variables that could not be definitely assigned to type i or type ii .",
    "the more detail description of the observation and their analysis was presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite used difference image analysis to preform photometric measurements .",
    "the lightcurves of cepheids were prewhitened with the period given in the original papers as well as periods independently found by us .",
    "the two periods differed only in questionable cases .",
    "the prewhitened lightcurves were searched for periods using both the discrete fourier transform and multiharmonic analysis of variance @xcite .",
    "the final period estimates were taken using the latter method results .",
    "all the secondary periods found in a wide range around known structures in the petersen diagram ( period ratio vs. longer period ) were visually verified . during our analysis",
    "we found a few stars that were incorrectly classified .",
    "we present these in the appendix in order to help purify the m31 cepheid sample used in future studies .",
    "below we present each double mode pulsator separately . comparison to the cepheids found in other environments and discussion of pulsation properties will be presented in next section .",
    "we denote fundamental mode and first overtone pulsators by f/1o and first and second mode pulsators by 1o/2o .",
    "the star identifiers come from @xcite and @xcite . periods and fourier parameters ( phase differences @xmath16 and amplitude ratios @xmath17 ; * ? ? ?",

    "we found a strong signal for a secondary period but its value can not be found unambiguously because of the strong aliases in the power spectrum .",
    "the prewhitening of the light curve is illustrated in figure  [ fig : cep257 ] .",
    "the four possible values are ( starting from the most probable ) : @xmath21 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , or @xmath44 .",
    "they give period ratios of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "all of these values fall in the range typical for 1o/2o pulsators .",
    "@xcite found the period of this star to be @xmath49 .",
    "the photometry presented by @xcite results in a primary period of @xmath50 and a secondary period of @xmath51 .",
    "the prewhitening of the light curve is presented in figure  [ fig : cep1300 ] .",
    "the period ratio of @xmath52 is slightly lower than the period ratio for known f/1o pulsators but all of them have shorter periods .",
    "it lies on the extension of f/1o sequence on the petersen diagram .",
    "thus we classify it as f/1o cepheid .",
    "this object was already announced by @xcite and @xcite with periods of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "using @xcite photometry we found periods of @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( figure  [ fig : cep1285 ] ) .",
    "this object turns out to have periods similar to pso_j010.6063 + 40.8608 discussed above , with a slightly smaller period ratio of @xmath57 .",
    "we conclude that this is a f/1o pulsator .",
    "the analysis of photometry presented by @xcite revealed two periods in this object : @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the prewhitening shown in figure  [ fig : cep1364 ] reveals a sound detection of secondary period .",
    "the period ratio of @xmath60 is not typical for any known combination of radial modes .",
    "this object can be either a non - radial pulsator or a blend of two stars .",
    "non - radial modes are observed in other cepheids @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite tried to reproduce @xmath61 period ratio observed in some of the lmc and smc first overtone cepheids .",
    "their findings are not applicable to pso_j011.3583 + 42.0404 because neither analyzed sample nor the models extended to primary periods long enough .",
    "we show the petersen diagram for known classical double mode f/1o and 1o/2o cepheids in figure  [ fig : peter ] .",
    "separate symbols are used to present objects from the milky way ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ) , lmc @xcite , smc @xcite , m33 @xcite and m31 .",
    "there are four different positions shown for j00450019 + 4129313 , which correspond to the different aliases of the secondary period .",
    "all are consistent with 1o/2o pulsator .",
    "one can see that positions of pso_j010.6063 + 40.8608 and pso_j010.9364 + 41.2504 are consistent with extrapolation of the relation seen for f/1o pulsators .",
    "the fact that fundamental mode periods of these objects are close to @xmath62 makes them unusual .",
    "the lightcurves of the fundamental mode cepheids with similar periods show two maxima in each period .",
    "the appearance of the second maximum is caused by a 1:2 resonance of the second overtone and the fundamental mode .",
    "we note that the calculations of @xcite , which were presented only in conference proceedings , suggest that f/1o pulsations with fundamental mode periods of around @xmath62 are caused by the resonance mentioned above .",
    "the range of luminosities and effective temperatures in which this mechanism operates is very small .",
    "this should allow very detail modeling of these stars .",
    "also the preliminary models for these stars indicate @xmath63 close to 2 and masses from 6 to @xmath64 ( dziembowski & smolec , in preparation ) . based on the petersen diagram presented in  figure  [ fig : peter ]",
    "we suggest that the longest period f/1o cepheids in lmc ( ogle - lmc - cep-1082 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) and smc ( ogle - smc - cep-1497 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) may also display double mode pulsations because of the 1:2 resonance of 2o and f modes .",
    "both these objects are separated from the rest of f/1o cepheids in a given galaxy by at least @xmath69 in @xmath70 .",
    "the double - mode cepheids with periods as long as presented here might have been overlooked in previous analyses of the existing time - series photometry for variable stars in other galaxies .",
    "the double mode pulsators presented here fall outside not only the previously published petersen diagrams constructed for known pulsators but also outside the period range studied in many theoretical investigations .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on a few different data access policies that we have seen during the literature search for data on the analyzed stars .",
    "one paper discussed the results of the search for m31 cepheids and scientific results found using them but did not provide any information about the stars themselves , not even their coordinates .",
    "the next one presented the coordinates and basic properties of the variable stars but did not presented any time - resolved photometry .",
    "in other example the authors presented the list of variables and claimed that the timeseries photometry is made public but in fact it was not accessible .",
    "in one more example we have found that the photometry is published but the julian dates are rounded to integer values , which makes such photometry useless .",
    "there were only two examples in which the authors made photometry public in a proper form to allow scientific research .",
    "we call on authors to present both the properties of the variable stars found ( at least position , brightness , and period ) as well as their photometric timeseries for the astronomical community . with growing observing capabilities , observers typically are not able to extract the whole scientific information contained in their data .",
    "allowing others to conduct more detail investigation is a good practice .",
    "the author is grateful wojciech dziembowski and radosaw smolec for fruitful discussion as well as andy gould for reading the manuscript .",
    "this research has made use of the vizier catalogue access tool , cds , strasbourg , france .",
    "[ [ j004517694136367 ] ] j00451769 + 4136367 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +        photometry presented by @xcite indicates that this is an artifact produced by the difference image analysis .",
    "the variations of measured flux are caused by the nearby brighter cepheid j00452353 + 4140040 .",
    "the periods of both objects agree .",
    "our analysis of photometry presented by @xcite revealed that this object varies with periods of @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
