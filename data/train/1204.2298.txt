    "<S> we review the difficulties of the generalized chaplygin gas model to fit observational data , due to the tension between background and perturbative tests . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that such issues may be circumvented by means of a self - interacting scalar field representation of the model . </S>",
    "<S> however , this proposal seems to be successful only if the self - interacting scalar field has a non - canonical form . </S>",
    "<S> the latter can be implemented in rastall s theory of gravity .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of local structures in the universe can not be explained in the framework of general relativity by assuming the existence of only ordinary matter , composed essentially by baryons : a large amount of invisible matter with zero effective pressure is also necessary . </S>",
    "<S> this unknown form of matter , that escaped direct detection until now , is called _ dark matter _ and its existence is also required in order to explain the structure formation process in an expanding universe . </S>",
    "<S> the principal candidates for the role of dark matter are axions ( light scalar particles predicted by the grand unified theory ) and neutralinos ( massive , stable , supersymmetric particles ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both these candidates exhibit a very small cross section , and do not emit any kind of electromagnetic radiation , thus possibly explaining the absence of a direct detection . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> these candidates are predicted on the basis of theories which have no experimental confirmation . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the search for other possible explanations is necessary .    </S>",
    "<S> the _ dark side of the universe _ contains another exotic component , named _ </S>",
    "<S> dark energy_. the latter is necessary to explain the present stage of accelerated expansion of the universe , indicated by the analysis of type ia supernovae ( snia ) as standard candles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it must be pointed out that there is a lot of discussion concerning the real status of snia as standard candles , but , even if such hypothesis is doubtful , the position of the first peak in the angular spectrum of the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) indicates a flat universe @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , since dark matter and baryons represent about the @xmath0 of the the critical density , the remaining @xmath1 must be in the form of another dark component , which , moreover , do not agglomerate via gravitational collapse . </S>",
    "<S> the latter property requires a negative pressure , which is also the condition necessary to drive the cosmic accelerated expansion . </S>",
    "<S> such feature can be achieved by introducing a cosmological constant , re - interpreted as the quantum vacuum energy density , which is an inevitable consequence of quantum field theory in curved space - time . however , such interesting proposal is spoiled by a huge discrepancy between the predicted theoretical value and the one derived from observation . in view of this , many other candidates appeared ( e.g. quintessence and @xmath2-essence models ) all of them with some impressive successes and deceptive drawbacks @xcite .    among the alternatives evoked to describe the dark sector of the universe , one interesting proposal are the so - called unified models . </S>",
    "<S> the prototype of these models is the chaplygin gas ( cg ) @xcite , which is inspired by string theory : it is a fluid able to behave as dark matter in the past and as dark energy in the future , thus properly reproducing the expansion history of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> however , the cg suffers from some difficulties when it is tested against observation . </S>",
    "<S> this led to a more general formulation , the so - called generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) @xcite , which possesses a new parameter @xmath3 ( @xmath4 recovers the original cg ) . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , a tension appears between the predictions of the model and various observational tests : the background ones ( e.g. snia , bao , h ) favor @xmath5 whereas the perturbative ones require @xmath6 , in order to have a positive speed of sound @xcite .    in order to cope with this problem </S>",
    "<S> a possibility is to abandon the fluid description for the gcg , using instead a self - interacting scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , this can not be done using a canonical scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> we show that an interesting way out is to use a non - canonical self - interacting scalar field as suggested by rastall s theory of gravity , an alternative to general relativity where the imposition of a strict conservation of the energy - momentum tensor is relaxed @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the gcg equation of state : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the density and @xmath3 and @xmath9 are positive parameters ( @xmath4 corresponds to the original cg model ) . inserting this expression in the continuity equation in a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric , i.e. @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the scale factor and the dot indicates derivative with respect to the cosmic time , one finds the following expression : @xmath12^\\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the present - time gcg density ( the present time is fixed by requiring @xmath15 ) .    the tension between background and perturbative constraints can be easily seen already from the equation of state ( [ eos ] ) : while in principle such definition allows for any real value of @xmath3 , at the perturbative level we have to deal with the square of the speed of sound , which has the following form : @xmath16 which is positive only for @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> the source of the tension comes from the fact that background tests favor negative values of @xmath3 @xcite , which are excluded at perturbative level due to the occurrency of an imaginary speed of sound . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is due to the fluid representation adopted . </S>",
    "<S> it must be noted that such fluid representation emerges naturally from the nambu - goto action in the original cg formulation @xcite , but the gcg has not the same clear connection , thus there is no fundamental reason to stay in the context of string theory . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is possible to conceive a more fundamental representation for the gcg . a first possibility is to interpret the cgc as a self - interacting scalar field . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> a canonical self - interacting scalar field possesses a speed of sound equal to the speed of light , as we now prove .    </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite , we employ the formula @xmath17 which links pressure perturbations @xmath18 to the energy density ones @xmath19 , both in a generic gauge , via @xmath20 , which is the speed of sound in the rest frame of the scalar field . in this formula </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath21 is the adiabatic speed of sound , defined as @xmath22 ; the equation of state parameter is @xmath23 ; @xmath2 is the wavenumber coming from a normal mode decomposition and @xmath24 is defined via @xmath25 a canonical self - interacting scalar field has the following expressions for the pressure and the density in the flrw background : @xmath26 and it obeys the klein - gordon equation , which , in the flrw background , reads @xmath27 hence , the adiabatic speed of sound for a canonical self - interacting scalar field has the form @xmath28 substituting in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> the expressions for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , together with eqs .   and , one obtains @xmath31 = \\left[\\dot{\\phi_0}\\dot{\\delta\\phi } - \\phi\\dot{\\phi_0}^2 + v_{,\\phi}\\delta\\phi + 3h\\dot{\\phi_0}\\delta\\phi\\right]\\;,\\ ] ] which requires @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> this proves that a canonical scalar field can not play the role of dark matter .    </S>",
    "<S> so , how a self - interacting scalar field could represent the dark matter component ? </S>",
    "<S> we have to consider a non - canonical scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt rastall s gravity theory @xcite , where the energy - momentum tensor @xmath33 does not obey the usual conservation law . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the divergence of @xmath33 reads @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the ricci scalar and @xmath36 is a constant . </S>",
    "<S> the field equations in rastall s theory read @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a dimensionless constant connected to @xmath36 . when @xmath39 , general relativity theory is recovered . using the canonical form for the energy - momentum tensor of a scalar field , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. @xmath40 we obtain the following coupled equations : @xmath41 from eq .  , the following effective energy - momentum tensor can be read off : @xmath42 implying the following expressions for the energy density and pressure : @xmath43 using this expression in eq .   to evaluate the speed of sound , </S>",
    "<S> one finds @xmath44 this implies a vanishing speed of sound for @xmath45 . in this case , the non - canonical self - interacting scalar field based on rastall s theory may represent dark matter . on the other side , from the non - perturbative point of view , it can represents dark energy by a suitable choice of the potential . </S>",
    "<S> we will explore this possibility in what follows .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a self - interacting scalar field , with the effective energy - momentum tensor ( [ efetivo ] ) , with @xmath45 : @xmath46 inserting the flrw metric , we have the following density and pressure associated with this scalar field : @xmath47 let us suppose that this density and pressure reproduce the background behaviour of the gcg model . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in this case , we have , @xmath48 where @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in order to have a zero speed of sound , the scalar model must obey the following equations : @xmath50 where , just for future convenience , we have made the redefinition @xmath51 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us inspect now the perturbative behaviour of this system , computing scalar perturbations in the density contrast . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbed equations in the synchronous coordinate condition read @xcite : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the density contrast of the matter component . using the scale factor as independent variable , </S>",
    "<S> the above system of equations take the following form : @xmath55 \\dot\\delta - \\frac{3}{2}\\frac{\\omega_0}{a^3f^2(a)}\\delta = \\phi'\\psi ' - \\frac{v_\\phi}{f^2(a)}\\psi\\;,\\\\ 2\\psi '' & + & \\left[\\frac{3}{a } + 2\\frac{f'(a)}{f(a)}\\right]\\psi ' + \\left[\\frac{k^2}{a^2f^2(a ) } + \\frac{v_{\\phi\\phi}}{f^2(a)}\\right]\\psi = \\phi'\\delta'\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .    </S>",
    "<S> using a bayesian analysis and comparing the theoretical predictions of our model with the 2dfrgs data for the power spectrum of matter distribution in the universe , we find a significant probability region for @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in figure [ rastall - fig2 ] , for some particular values of the parameter @xmath58 . for more details , see reference @xcite .     in the rastall s scalar model with @xmath59 ; @xmath60 and @xmath61.,title=\"fig : \" ]   in the rastall s scalar model with @xmath59 ; @xmath60 and @xmath61.,title=\"fig : \" ]   in the rastall s scalar model with @xmath59 ; @xmath60 and @xmath61.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in conclusion , if the gcg model is represented by a non - canonical scalar field , like the one suggested by rastall s theory of gravity , the observational tension that plagues the gcg fluid model may disappear or , at least , be considerably alleviated . </S>",
    "<S> this fact may open new perspectives for the dark matter - dark energy unification program . </S>"
