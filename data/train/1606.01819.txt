    "as explained in @xcite , finding periodic solutions of the elliptic restricted three body problem is more difficult than finding periodic solutions of the circular restricted three body problem . among the reasons we have the fact that the elliptic system is nonconservative and the fact that the period of a periodic solution in the elliptic case must be a multiple of the period of the motion of the primaries .    in this paper , rather than extending a solution to a family of solutions or trying to find several families , like it",
    "is done , for example in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , we just take one possible solution and try to obtain the initial conditions that make the trajectory as closed as it can possible be .",
    "we notice that even though we made the orbit come back to a position that is within a distance of just 4 meters with a difference in velocity smaller than 0.2 meter per second from its initial velocity , we could not do better after several weeks of computer work .",
    "the author is inclined to believe that near his initial conditions there are not initial conditions that make the solution mathematically periodic .",
    "this is due to the fact that his approach that started with the regular newton s method , then with variation of the newton s method and finally with an exhaustive search , did not seem to converge .",
    "it is well known that for any positive @xmath3 , if @xmath4 satisfies the differential equation @xmath5 with @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the gravitational constant , then , the functions    @xmath8    and    @xmath9    describe the motion of two bodies with masses @xmath10 and @xmath11 kilograms respectively moving under the effect of the gravity of each other .",
    "this is , these two functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 satisfy the system of differential equations    @xmath14    denoting @xmath15 , we have that @xmath16 , @xmath17 and the distance between the positions @xmath12 and @xmath13 is given by @xmath18 .",
    "it follows that the maximum distance between the two bodies is @xmath19 meters and it is reached when @xmath20 equals zero .",
    "also it is known that the period @xmath2 of the motion of the system equals to @xmath21 .",
    "a direct verification shows that if we work in the units * ud * , @xmath22 and @xmath23 such that    @xmath24    then , the period of the motion is @xmath25 * ut * , the gravitational constant is @xmath26 and , moreover , the expression for @xmath12 and @xmath13 reduces to    @xmath27 and    @xmath28    with @xmath29",
    ". we will represent by @xmath30 the position of a body with a mass so small that it does not affect the motion of the bodies with masses @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "typical examples for the motion described by @xmath31 are asteroids and spacecraft .",
    "if @xmath30 moves only under the influence of the gravity of the bodies @xmath10 and @xmath11 then , using the new units , it satisfies the following equation ,    @xmath32    the main and only result of this paper shows that if    @xmath33    then , integrating the differential equation that defines @xmath31 using the taylor method of order @xmath34 with working precision @xmath35 and step @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the 30 digit approximation @xmath38 ) , we obtain that    @xmath39    assuming that @xmath40 * m * , @xmath41 * kg * , @xmath42 * m * , we obtain that @xmath43 * m * and @xmath44 * s * , and ,    @xmath45    @xmath46    we obtain equivalent results regarding the differences between the initial and final conditions using the routine from the software _ mathematica _    * ndsolve[*differential equation,*workingprecision*@xmath47}$ ]    treating this motion as a periodic solution , we numerically compute the eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix to be @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , with @xmath48 and @xmath49 equal to    @xmath52    and @xmath50 and @xmath51 equal to    @xmath53    we have that    @xmath54    and @xmath55    since we have four different eigenvalues , assuming they lie in the unit circle , we conclude that the solution is stable .",
    "in order to move from the planar solution of the elliptic restricted three body problem presented above to an ephemeris of the solution we need to set up coordinates , then we need to choose an interval of time representing a period for jupiter and also we need to find the right inclusion @xmath56 that sends the two coordinates from the planar solution presented here to the chosen coordinate system for our solar system",
    ".    * period of jupiter : * we have taken the period of the orbit to be @xmath57 days . for the planar ode that we took in the previous section to solve the elliptic restricted three body problem",
    ", we have that @xmath58 represents the aphelion of jupiter .",
    "we will be assuming that jupiter s aphelion happens on february 17 , 2017 at 00:00:00.0000 .",
    "* coordinates for the solar system :* we will be using one of the solar system used by nasa and we will be using the coordinates displayed by webhorizon using the following settings :    center body name : solar system barycenter ( 0 ) source : de-0431le-0431 + center - site name : body center + center geodetic : 0.00000000,0.00000000,0.0000000 e - lon(deg),lat(deg),alt(km ) + center cylindric : 0.00000000,0.00000000,0.0000000 e - lon(deg),dxy(km),dz(km ) + center radii : ( undefined ) + output units : au - d + output format : 02 + reference frame : icrf / j2000.0 + output type : geometric cartesian states + coordinate systm : ecliptic and mean equinox of reference epoch + as an example , the position and velocity of jupiter on february 17 , 2017 is given by :    a.d .",

    "we have obtained that the best fit is obtained when    * jupiter s orbital inclination ( deg ) : 1.300333 * jupiter s longitude of ascending node ( deg ) : 100.53 * jupiter s argument of perihelion ( deg ) : -86.311 * aphelion : 5.453 au    besides adjusting the orbital parameters , we have made a translation of 0.007067 au in the aphelion direction to make the fit better . in this way , if we define    @xmath59    @xmath60    and    @xmath61    our immersion is given by @xmath62 with @xmath63    recall that @xmath64 is the period of the motion in @xmath22 that we are making equal to @xmath65 days . we will be using @xmath66 to transform positions to the solar system coordinates .    * verifying the selected immersion : * in order to check the difference between the elliptical motion and the real jupiter s motion we will consider the following two sequences with 4333 vectors    @xmath67    where @xmath68 , and    @xmath69    where @xmath70 are the coordinates of jupiter on february 17 , 2017 at 00:00:00.0000 , @xmath71 are the coordinates of jupiter on february 18 , 2017 at 00:00:00.0000 , and so on .    a direct verification shows that the distance between the @xmath72 and @xmath73 , that is , the sequence of real number given by    @xmath74    is a collection of numbers that varies from @xmath75 to @xmath76 which means the the perfect ellipse in the space given by the immersion @xmath66 provides an approximation that is within a distance of @xmath76 au for all the days from feb 17 , 2017 to dec 28 , 2028 .",
    "this approximation is not bad having in mind that everyday jupiter moves a distance between @xmath77 au and @xmath78 au .    in the same way that @xmath72 generates an ephemeris for jupiter starting from feb 17 , 2017 which lies on a perfect plane",
    ", we can generate an ephemeris for the motion discussed in this paper and , in this way , we can compare this suggested motion for a spacecraft with the motion of other celestial bodies .",
    "this ephemeris is displayed on the next section .",
