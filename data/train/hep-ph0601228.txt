    "in this article , we will describe some of the newest results obtained by the d  and cdf experiments at the tevatron in 2005",
    ". we will give in turn some results about qcd , top , b physics , new phenomena and prospects for higgs boson searches .",
    "the tevatron is a @xmath0 collider located near chicago with a center - of - mass energy of 1.96 tev , which is the highest energetic machine before the start of the lhc .",
    "the expected sensitivity to physics beyond the standard model is thus high .",
    "the two main experiments ( d  and cdf ) are installed along the ring and provide independent physics analyses to allow cross checks between the results .",
    "the accumulated luminosity where n , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 are respectively the number of events for a given process , the cross section for that process and the luminosity .",
    "] by the d  experiment is given in fig .",
    "1 until the time of the summer school .",
    "the expected luminosity before 2009 when the tevatron will probably be turned off is expected to be between 4 and 8 fb@xmath3 .",
    "the luminosity accumulated by the cdf experiment is found to be similar and slightly higher .",
    "the data taking efficiency , which gives the percentage of time when d  is able to take data , is noticeably well above 90% .    a scheme of the d  detector is given in fig .",
    "2 . we will give the description of the d  detector starting from the center to the outside @xcite .",
    "the most central part comprises a ( forward and central ) silicon and a fiber tracking detector , which allows to measure precisely the location and momentum of charged particles .",
    "the tracking detector is surrounded by a solenoid which delivers a magnetic field of 2 t. the compensating , finely segmented , liquid argon and uranium calorimeter provides nearly a full solid angle coverage up to a rapidity larger than 4 .",
    "the muon detector is composed of the central muon proportional drift tubes , scintillating detectors used in the trigger , and mini - drift tubes in the forward region , allowing a muon detection up to a rapidity of 2 .",
    "a toroid magnet allows to reconstruct the muon momentum using the muon system only , and a better resolution is obtained by combining this information with the ones from the tracking detectors .",
    "the cdf detector has similar performances and is composed of a central tracking and silicon detector , a calorimeter made of lead sheets sandwiched with scintillator for the electromagnetic part , and of iron plates and scintillator for the hadronic part , and a muon detector .",
    "the leveir arm for the tracking detector is larger than for d  because of the space availability ( we recall that d  did not have any central magnet in run i ) .",
    "we will now describe the different physics results in turn .",
    "[ fig1 ]    [ fig2 ]",
    "in this paragraph , we will discuss the cdf and d  results on qcd .",
    "first , it is useful to notice that these experiments lead to results quite complementary to the ones from hera , and the previous fixed target experiments . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the kinematical plane in ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) ( @xmath4 is the proton momentum fraction carried by the interacting quark , and @xmath5 is the squared energy transferred at the lepton vertex ) reached at hera extends noticeably the reach of the previous fixed target experiment . the tevatron experiments are also sensitive to higher @xmath5 and higher @xmath4 value .",
    "the constraint on the gluon density at high @xmath4 in particular is coming mainly from the tevatron and fixed targets experiments . in that sense , the data taken at hera and tevatron are complementary to obtain precisely the quark and gluon densities from dokshitzer gribov lipatov altarelli parisi ( dglap ) qcd fits @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 structure function measurements as well as the qcd fits are given in ref .",
    "the uncertainty on the gluon distribution at high @xmath4 is large and reaches more than 50% for @xmath4 larger than 0.5 .",
    "[ fig3 ]      the cdf and d  experiments performed a preliminary measurement of the inclusive jet cross sections as a function of their transverse momentum to probe the high-@xmath4 gluon density .",
    "the preliminary measurement performed by the dcollaboration with a luminosity of about 378 pb@xmath3 and two bins in rapidity is given in fig .",
    "the measurement in the lowest bin in rapidity ( @xmath7 ) has been multiplied by 10 to be able to distinguish between both measurements .",
    "the data are compared with nlo calculations using the cteq6.1 m parametrisation @xcite and the nlojet++ program @xcite .",
    "there is a good agreement between the measurement and the qcd calculation over 9 orders of magnitude .",
    "the data over theory plot for the same data is given in fig .",
    "5 . the data points are in black for both rapidity bins and the systematic uncertainties are indicated by the yellow band .",
    "the systematics are largely dominated by the uncertainty on jet energy scale .",
    "the jet energy scale is determined using the @xmath8 balance in photon and jet events where the electromagnetic energy scale is known using @xmath9 decaying into @xmath10 , and the photon and the jet are required to be back - to - back .",
    "the theory corresponds to nlo qcd calculations using the cteq6.1 m parametrisation .",
    "the cteq6.1 parton distribution uncertainty ( mainly due to the bad knowledge of the gluon density at high @xmath4 ) is given by the red dashed line , and the difference with the mrst2004 @xcite parametrisation by the blue dotted line .",
    "the present uncertainties of the measurement do not allow a further constraint of the parton distribution .",
    "a significant improvement of the jet energy scale uncertainty is expected in the beginning of 2006 which will allow to constrain the high-@xmath4 gluon density .",
    "let us also note that a measurement at higher rapidity is also another way to be sensitive to the high-@xmath4 gluon since pure gluon - gluon and quark - gluon jets are more present at higher rapidity than quark - quark processes .",
    "a preliminary measurement with a lower luminosity has already performed at lower luminosity and is being redone @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the dijet mass cross section has also been performed by the d  collaboration and will allow to put some new limits on compositeness in the near future since this measurement is sensitive to possible quark or gluon substructures @xcite .",
    "the cdf collaboration performed a similar measurement of the inclusive jet @xmath8 cross section using the @xmath11 algorithm @xcite .",
    "[ fig4 ]    [ fig5 ]      another measurement which has been performed by the d  collaboration is the measurement of the difference in azimuthal angle between the two leading jets in qcd events @xcite .",
    "the azimuthal angle between the two leading jets is expected to be close to @xmath12 for pure dijet events whereas the angle will be less than @xmath12 in the case of multiple jet events .",
    "the angle measurement is thus directly sensitive to higher order effects without measuring effectively the jet structure of the event .",
    "furthermore , this measurement does not suffer too much from the jet energy uncertainty due to jet energy scale since it depends on angles and not directly on energy . the measurement of the relative differential cross section in azimuthal angle is shown in fig .",
    "6 in four different bins in jet transverse energy .",
    "the measurement is compared to lo and nlo calculation in dashed and full lines respectively .",
    "we notice a disagreement at low values of @xmath13 with the lo calculation since the number of multijet events is too small at lo .",
    "nlo calculation agrees nicely with the data except at very large @xmath13 close to @xmath12 where not enough soft radiation is produced .",
    "we also show the sensitivity of this measurement on monte carlo tuning in fig . 7 .",
    "the herwig @xcite monte carlo shows a good agreement with data , whereas the default pythia @xcite shows some discrepancy .",
    "increasing initial state radiation in pythia",
    "( technically , parp(67 ) was increased from 1 . to 4 . )",
    "solves the problem , and the sensitivity on this parameter is shown in fig .",
    "7 by the blue band .",
    "it is quite important to determine precisely the parton distributions in the proton and to tune the existing monte carlo to be able to obtain precise predictions at the lhc , which is fundamental to see some effects beyond the standard model , especially in the jet channels .",
    "we can quote in particular the importance of understanding the jet cross sections for @xmath14-parity violated susy or the search for higher dimensions .",
    "[ fig6 ]    [ fig7 ]      the cdf collaboration performed another measurement sensitive to the gluon and quark contents in the proton , as well as @xmath15 and multi - gluon emission , namely the jet shape measurement .",
    "the measurement consists in measuring @xmath16 defined as follows : @xmath17 where the summation runs over the number of jets in the event ( @xmath18 ) , and the jet radius is @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath16 is a measurement of the repartion of transverse energy within the jet .",
    "fig [ fig8 ] shows the jet shape distributions for two different bins in jet transverse momentum , namely ( @xmath19 gev ) and ( @xmath20 gev ) for central jets ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the cdf measurement extends to more @xmath8 bins @xcite .",
    "we also display in the same figure the expectations from the pythia @xcite monte carlo for gluon and quark jets .",
    "this measurement allows to determine the proportion of quark and gluon jets as a function of their transverse momentum . as expected , the lowest @xmath8 jets are gluon process dominated whereas the higher @xmath8 jets are quark process dominated .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      fig .",
    "8 shows a typical jet event at the tevatron .",
    "the upper plots describes the hard scattering process where one observes the jet produced in the event as well as the beam remnants .",
    "the lower plot displays what really happens at the tevatron ( or later on at the lhc ) .",
    "in addition to the hard scattering , we have initial and final state radiation which can produce additional jets in the event , and additional partonic interactions not related to the hard interaction ( soft colour interactions can occur between the spectator partons in addition to the hard interaction ) .",
    "this results in additional energy measured in the detectors which are not related to the partonic interaction .",
    "it is important to understand this phenomenon if one wants to go back to parton level processes to measure the top mass , for instance . to study these  underlying events \" ( by opposition to the main hard scattering )",
    "the cdf collaboration measured the energy emitted outside the dijet hemisphere in clean back - to - back dijet events . for those events , one picks first the direction of the leading jet in the events , and measures the energy in the transverse region away from the leading jet . to avoid the particles included in both jets , only the energy between 60 and 120 degrees in azimuthal angles away from the leading jet",
    "is measured .",
    "this energy is dominated by underlying events , or in other words , by soft partonic interactions .",
    "the results were compared to the pythia monte carlo @xcite and found to be in good agreement @xcite since pythia was already tuned to previous run i cdf data .",
    "it is important to note that this tuning will have to be redone at the lhc aince it is not expected that the energy of underlying events will be independent of the center - of - mass energy .",
    "diffractive events are of special interest since they show undestroyed protons in the final state , and their mechanism is not yet fully understood .",
    "mainly two kinds of models exist to describe diffraction : the first model assumes the existence of a colourless object , the pomeron , which itself can be constituted of quarks and gluons , and the other one assumes that diffractive events are due to non perturbative string rearrangements in the final state ( this happens at a much longer time scale than the hard interaction , at the time scale of hadronisation ) .",
    "we distinguish between single diffractive events and double pomeron exchanges which correspond to diffractive events on the proton or antiproton side only or on both sides .      experimentally , there are two different ways to study diffractive events .",
    "the first way is to detect directly events where there is no colour exchange between the jet produced in the event and the proton in the final state , and to look for a gap in rapidity in the forward region away from the proton direction .",
    "the other way is to detect directly the proton in the final state in dedicated detectors far away from the main detector in the tunnel called roman pot detectors .",
    "the d  and cdf collaborations installed this kind of detectors in the tunnels . to describe diffractive events ,",
    "one introduces two additional kinematical variables : @xmath22 is the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the non coloured object ( the pomeron ) , and @xmath23 is the fraction of the pomeron momentum carried by the interacting parton ( quark or gluon ) inside the pomeron if we assume a partonic structure of the pomeron . by definition , @xmath24 .",
    "the cdf and d   dipole \" ( close to the dipole magnets ) roman pot detectors are located at about 58 m away from the main detector in the outgoing antiproton direction and are sensitive to @xmath25 down to 0 , and @xmath26 .",
    "the d  collaboration installed in addition ",
    "quadrupole \" roman pot detectors ( close to the quadrupole magnets ) in both outgoing proton and antiproton directions located at about 23 and 33 meters away from the main detector .",
    "these last detectors are sensitive to @xmath27 gev@xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "the commission of these detectors was recently finished and new physics results are expected soon .",
    "the percentage of single diffractive events was already measured by the d  and cdf collaborations in run i and found to be about 1% and depends on the exact process considered .",
    "the amount of diffractive events at hera , the @xmath30 collider located at desy , hamburg , is close to 10% , which shows already that we can not obtain the tevatron results directly from the hera data , or in other words , that there is no factorisation between @xmath30 and @xmath0 colliders .",
    "this can be due to additional soft interactions ( soft gluon exchange ) between partons in the final state which kill the rapidity gap or destroy the proton in the final state .",
    "one important measurement on diffraction was performed in run i by the cdf collaboration @xcite . using single diffractive events , ( an anti - proton was tagged in the roman pot detector ) , the cdf collaboration was able to measure the gluon density in the pomeron using dijet events .",
    "the cdf data points and their error bands in yellow are shown in fig .",
    "the results are compared directly to the expectations from the h1 diffractive dglap qcd fits in red full line .",
    "we notice that there is a discrepancy in normalisation by about a factor 10 between the cdf measurement and the hera expectations ( this corresponds to the different in the percentage of diffractive events between hera and the tevatron already mentionned ) .",
    "however , in a large domain in @xmath23 , the shape of the gluon density is found to be similar which means that the same shape for the gluon density can be used to describe hera and tevatron data , as well as probably lhc data in the future .",
    "it is quite important to have precise measurements of the gluon and quark densities inside the pomeron if one wants to make precise predictions at the lhc @xcite .",
    "other measurements have been performed by the cdf collaboration @xcite concerning the tests of factorisation at the tevatron .",
    "it was found that factorisation holds almost in the full phase space at the tevatron alone , and that the same @xmath4 and @xmath5 dependence has been found for inclusive or diffractive jet production .",
    "[ fig10 ]      looking for the existence of exclusive events at the tevatron is quite important for the lhc .",
    "if exclusive events exist , it could be a way to look for diffractive exclusive higgs , top , or stop production at the lhc depending on the production cross section @xcite , since it is possible to reconstruct precisely the mass of the object produced diffractively using roman pot detectors , using the so - called missing mass method , the total diffractive mass produced being equal to @xmath31 .",
    "the cdf collaboration started to look for the eventual existence of exclusive events in the dijet channel .",
    "the results are shown in fig . 10 for a low luminosity of 26 pb@xmath3",
    "( the actual accumulated luminosity by d  and cdf is about 1 fb@xmath3 and we can expect an update of these results very soon ) .",
    "the cdf data are divided in three different samples corresponding to single diffraction ( triangles ) , and double pomeron exchange ( empty and full circle points requiring a different domain in rapidity for the gap : @xmath32 or @xmath33 for empty and full points respectively ) .",
    "the dijet mass fraction ( the ratio of the dijet mass by the total diffractive mass in the event ) is displayed in fig .",
    "exclusive events are expected to appear at large dijet mass fraction since the full energy is used to produce dijets ( there is no loss of energy in pomeron remnants ) .",
    "no enhancement is observed at high dijet mass fraction which is compatible with the tail of the inclusive distribution , but the cross section for exclusive production is expected to be small .",
    "it will be quite interesting to see the results with higher luminosity .",
    "other methods can also be developped to look for exclusive events like measuring the correlation between @xmath34 and the size of the rapidity gap which is larger for exclusive events , the ratio of the dilepton to diphoton cross sections which should show an enhancement at high diphoton - dilepton mass if exclusive events exist , or the ratio between b and light jet diffractive production @xcite .",
    "another method is to look for diffractive @xmath35 production .",
    "unfortunately , the acceptance for such low mass objects to be detected in roman pot detectors is small and the selection requires the existence of rapidity gaps .",
    "the diffractive mass has to be computed using the central calorimeter without benefitting from the good resolution of the roman pot detectors .",
    "the cdf collaboration looked for @xmath36 decaying into dimuon and a photon , and no further activity in the central detector was requested to ensure the exclusiveness of the process .",
    "a few exclusive candidate events were found but it is difficult to determine precisely the cosmic contamination @xcite .",
    "top physics is one of the hottest subjects at the tevatron , which is the only place where the top quark can be studied before the start of lhc .",
    "the top quark was indeed discovered at the tevatron run i in 1995 by the d  and cdf collaborations .",
    "compared to the other quarks , it has a much higher mass ( its mass is about 174 gev which is 40 times the bottom quark mass ) . due to its mass ,",
    "the top quark life time is very short ( about 10@xmath37s ) , and the top quark decays before hadronisation . in fig .",
    "12 , the schematic production and decay of a typical @xmath38 event is displayed .",
    "the production cross section at the tevatron is of the order of 6 pb , 85% of which are produced via a @xmath39 interaction , and 15% via a @xmath40 one .",
    "the top quark decays into a @xmath41 and a @xmath42 quark in 100% of the cases since @xmath43 is much greater than @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath41 can decay either leptonically as indicated in the figure or into 2 jets ( quarks @xmath45 ) .",
    "a typical topology to look for @xmath46 events is a multijet event ( 6 jets , 2 can be b - tagged ) , or a multi jet and lepton event with missing transverse energy coming from the @xmath41 decay .",
    "[ fig11 ]      the measurement of the top quark mass is a fundamental test of the standard model .",
    "the radiative corrections to the standard model predictions of electroweak measurements are dominated by the value of the top mass , and a precise measurement of the top mass is needed to constrain the electroweak tests of the standard model and the higgs boson mass .",
    "the measurement of the top mass depends first on the identification of the @xmath46 events by requiring a leptonic , multijet ( at least 4 ) event , and missing transverse energy .",
    "the background to this topology can be further reduced requiring some jets to be b - tagged .",
    "the mass measurement is also very sensitive the determination of the jet energy scale .",
    "one of the easiest methods to determine the top mass is to use the template method .",
    "the basic idea is to compute a @xmath47 between data and monte carlo simulations assuming different values of the top mass .",
    "in fact , the method is slightly more complicate : it is for instance possible to constrain the jet energy scale by constraining the measurement of the @xmath41 mass in data to be in agreement with the world average since the @xmath41 mass is already known precisely . the different run ii measurements of the top quark mass ( at the time of the summer school ) @xcite are given in fig . 13 for the d  and cdf collaborations . by comparison ,",
    "the run i average was 178 @xmath48 4.3 gev and the best single top mass measurement was performed in the lepton and jet channel by the d  collaboration @xcite ( 180.1 @xmath48 5.3 gev ) .",
    "a precision on the top mass a bit higher than 1 gev is expected by the end of run ii at the tevatron .",
    "the new run i top mass led to the prediction of the higgs boson mass of ( 114 @xmath49 69 @xmath50 45 ) gev using electroweak fits .",
    "reducing the uncertainty on the top mass will allow to reduce its large uncertainty .",
    "[ fig11 ]      the analysis of the @xmath46 events described in the previous paragraph leads directly to a measurement of the @xmath46 production cross section and can be compared directly to the prediction of the standard model .",
    "many different methods ( dilepton , lepton and jet , multi jet channels ) are used by the cdf and d  collaborations @xcite . the combined result for the cdf collaboration",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ]      another way to produce the top quark predicted by the standard model is the electroweak single production , where the top quark is produced via a @xmath41 .",
    "this process has not yet been observed , but a limit at 95% cl was set by the dcollaboration on the production cross section at 6.4 pb in the @xmath51-channel and 5 pb in the @xmath25-channel @xcite .",
    "the limit is now close to the cross section predicted by the standard model and an observation could come soon .",
    "the advantage of that process is to study the ckm matrix element @xmath43 , the top width and the @xmath52 coupling .",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath41 bosons can be produced directly by quark interactions at the tevatron . to obtain a lower background ,",
    "one measures the @xmath41 and @xmath9 cross sections when the @xmath9 or the @xmath41 decays into dileptons or lepton and neutrino respectively .",
    "the cdf and d  results are given in fig .",
    "15 and fig . 16 for @xmath9 and @xmath41 production respectively @xcite .",
    "the results obtained in run i ( center - of - mass energy of 1.8 tev ) are displayed together with the new run ii results ( center - of - mass energy of 1.96 tev ) and compared with the standard model expectation ( full line ) .",
    "the data points are not put all at either 1.8 or 1.96 tev to be able to distinguish between them .",
    "the different leptonic decays of the @xmath9 or @xmath41 are shown ( electron , muon or tau ) and we also note the good agreement between the measurements .    another important measurement to be performed at the tevatron is the @xmath41 mass . some update on this subject are expected in the near future .",

    "[ fig13 ]    [ fig14 ]      the @xmath41 asymmetries have been measured by the cdf collaboration .",

    "the rapidity distribution for @xmath55 is different from the one for @xmath56 .",

    "the present limits on susy particle production cross section lay in the region of 10@xmath81 fb for squark production and a few tenths of fb for sleptons .",

    "22 the limits on the @xmath85 coupling as a function of the neutralino mass for a fixed slepton mass of 200 gev @xcite , the run i result being indicated for reference .",
    "[ fig19 ]      a hot but difficult topic for the tevatron is the search for neutral higgs bosons .",
    "predictions have been made on the sensitivity to look for higgs bosons in the next years when luminosity increases and are given in fig .",
    "these results will strongly depend on the detector performances since the background is very high in all channels and the search for higgs boson quite challenging .",
    "the large error band shows the expectations for a 5@xmath1 dicovery , 3@xmath1 evidence , and a 95% cl limit as a function of the higgs mass from an analysis of the higgs sensitivity study working group @xcite ( the smaller band shows the previous results ) .",
    "however these results do not include systematic errors but only statistical ones and are thus optimistic .",
    "in these lectures , we have discussed many preliminary results from the tevatron on qcd , diffraction , electroweak , top and b physics , and new phenomena .",
    "much progress is expected in the future with the increase of luminosity ( this will benefit directly to new phenomena studies and the search for higgs bosons ) and a better understanding of systematics which are often dominated by the uncertainty on jet energy scale ( qcd cross section measurements and constraint on the parton distributions , electroweak physics and the @xmath41 mass measurement , top physics and the top mass measurement allowing to constrain further the standard model and the mass of the higgs boson ) .",
