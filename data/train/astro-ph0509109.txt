    "observations of transient x - ray binary systems in quiescence have greatly advanced studies of compact objects over the past decade .",

    "quiescent x - ray observations are also interesting for neutron star and black hole systems . for many neutron star systems ,",

    "the core temperature is thought to be set by the accretion history over a time period of 10,000 years @xcite .",
    "quiescent x - ray spectra of black hole systems do not appear to show a blackbody component , which is one reason they tend to be fainter than neutron star systems .",
    "it has also been argued that , in quiescence , black holes are radiatively less efficient than neutron star systems , which has been taken as evidence that a large fraction of the accreted matter is advected across the black hole event horizon @xcite .    with sensitive x - ray missions like the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and the _ x - ray multi - mirror mission ( xmm - newton ) _",

    "this system was discovered during the _ exosat _ galactic plane scans in 1984 june @xcite and was detected again by _ exosat _ in 1985 april at about the same flux level @xcite .",
    "these are the only two known detections of the source , so that it has apparently been in quiescence for 20 years .",
    "an x - ray burst was detected in 1985 , demonstrating that the system definitely harbors a neutron star @xcite .",
    "although _ exosat _ provided a relatively good @xmath7 position for the source , and the extinction along the line of sight to the source ( @xmath8 ) is fairly low , the source has not been optically identified .",
    "the primary goal of this work is to use a _ chandra _ observation of moderate length to detect the source in quiescence and to search for an optical counterpart .",

    "one reason that faint neutron star systems are of interest is that claims for the existence of black hole event horizons rely on the faintness of black hole systems relative to neutron star systems @xcite .",
    "the faintness of the black hole systems may be due to advection of accretion energy across the event horizon as occurs in advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) models ( * ? ? ?",

    "* for additional globular cluster sources ) .    in previous work ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) , it has been argued that , for a black hole or neutron star system with a given orbital period ( @xmath66 ) , the eddington - scaled mass accretion rate would be expected to be the same for black hole and neutron star systems . if this is true , the eddington - scaled x - ray luminosity is the best parameter for comparing the sources .",

    "the luminosities come from @xcite and references therein , and the black hole masses and errors on the masses come from @xcite .",
    "the neutron star luminosities come from the references shown in the figure  [ fig : luminosity ] caption . to determine the errors on @xmath67 , we assume for all systems that the unabsorbed soft x - ray fluxes are measured to an accuracy of 40% and that the distances are known to 25% .",
    "the assumed errors are not exactly correct for all sources , but they represent values that are typically quoted in the literature . while the black hole errors also include a contribution from the uncertainty in the black hole mass , we assume that all the neutron stars have masses of 1.4 .",
    "the bandpasses for the luminosities are nearly the same being 0.38  kev , 0.37  kev , or 0.510  kev in all cases .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that we are only quoting the x - ray luminosities here and that bolometric corrections could be important .",

    "the median luminosity is a factor of 42 lower than for neutron stars .",
    "while part of this effect is due to the higher black hole masses , the average black hole mass is 7.7 , which is only a factor of 5.5 higher than the neutron star masses assumed .",
    "currently , the only clear overlap between the distributions is caused by the high luminosity of v404  cyg , and as this source has the longest orbital period and has an evolved optical companion , this may be due to a higher quiescent mass accretion rate for v404  cyg .",
    "however , several of the neutron star systems , including exo  1747214 , have upper limits that are approaching the values seen for some of the other black hole systems .",
    "it is important to determine how faint sources like exo  1747214 and 3a  1905 + 000 @xcite are ( as well as their orbital periods ) as the neutron star and black hole distributions could significantly overlap in contradiction to what is expected for accretion models that include black hole advection such as the adaf model .",
    "one reason that exo  1747214 may be so faint is that , as far as we know , it has been in quiescence for 20 years .",
    "based on the theory of deep crustal heating for transient neutron stars @xcite , the evolution of the x - ray flux in the thermal component between outbursts depends on the source s mass accretion ( and thus outburst ) history .",

    ", the x - ray coverage in the 1980s limits our knowledge of the exo  1747214 outburst history .",
    "historically , the source has only been detected by _",
    "exosat _ , and it was detected in 1984 june and 1985 april . in both cases , the persistent x - ray flux was near @xmath69 erg  @xmath18  s@xmath1 .",
    "the missions with all - sky coverage in that era were _",
    "ariel v _ , which lasted until 1980 and _ ginga _ which began in 1987 @xcite .",
    "the 90% sky coverage from _ tenma _ during 19831984 make it unlikely that the exo  1747214 outburst started much before 1984 june .",
    "thus , assuming that exo  1747214 had a single outburst , its duration was very likely between 10 months and @xmath93 years .",
    "for the 13 year outburst from ks  1731260 , @xcite find that the neutron star cooling is dominated by the core rather than the crust 1 year after the outburst for a high - conductivity crust and 30 years after the outburst for a low - conductivity crust .",
    "given the shorter duration of the exo  1747214 outburst , it is likely that exo  1747214 was in the core - dominated phase when the _ chandra _ observation occurred .",
    "we can calculate the outburst recurrence time predicted by the @xcite theory for exo  1747214 .",
    "the recurrence time is given by @xmath70 @xcite , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the outburst duration and average flux level during the outburst , respectively , and @xmath73 is the quiescent flux level .",
    "assuming an outburst duration of 10 months ( at the lower end of the range derived above ) and an average outburst flux of @xmath69 erg  @xmath18  s@xmath1 , the upper limit on the quiescent flux of @xmath74 erg  @xmath18  s@xmath1 implies that @xmath75 years . if , in the future , it is found that the recurrence time is in fact shorter than this value , then a mechanism for enhanced cooling of the core would be necessary .",

    "if one of these is the exo  1747214 counterpart , it would imply a distance of a few kpc , significantly lower than the 11 kpc upper limit derived from the peak x - ray burst flux .",

    "another avenue for further study is to obtain optical spectra of the candidate counterparts .",
    "for example , detecting an h@xmath76 emission line would be a strong x - ray binary indicator .",
    "finally , it is worth pointing out that finding the optical counterpart is likely the only way that we will be able to improve the determination of the source distance .",

    "<S> we report on x - ray and optical observations of the x - ray burster exo  1747214 . </S>",
    "<S> this source is an x - ray transient , and its only known outburst was observed in 19841985 by the _ exosat _ satellite . </S>",
    "<S> we re - analyzed the _ </S>",
    "<S> exosat _ data to derive the source position , column density , and a distance upper limit using its peak x - ray burst flux . </S>",
    "<S> we observed the exo  1747214 field in 2003 july with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ to search for the quiescent counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> we found one possible candidate just outside the _ exosat _ error circle , but we can not rule out the possibility that the source is unrelated to exo  1747214 . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusion is that the upper limit on the unabsorbed 0.38 kev luminosity is @xmath0 erg  s@xmath1 , making exo  1747214 one of the faintest neutron star transients in quiescence . </S>",
    "<S> we compare this luminosity upper limit to the quiescent luminosities of 19 neutron star and 14 black hole systems and discuss the results in the context of the differences between neutron stars and black holes . </S>",
    "<S> based on the theory of deep crustal heating by brown and coworkers , the luminosity implies an outburst recurrence time of @xmath21300 yr unless some form of enhanced cooling occurs within the neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the possible x - ray counterpart is consistent with three blended optical / ir sources with @xmath3-magnitudes between 19.4 and 19.8 and @xmath4-magnitudes between 17.2 and 17.6 . </S>",
    "<S> one of these sources could be the quiescent optical / ir counterpart of exo  1747214 . </S>"
