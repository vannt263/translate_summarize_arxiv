    "basically , the _ shadow _ of a black hole is the region on the observer s sky that is left dark if the light sources are anywhere in the universe but not between the observer and the black hole . for a mathematical description ,",
    "it is convenient to consider light rays that are sent from the observer s position into the past . some of them are deflected by the black hole and then go out to bigger radii again ; because they can reach one of the light sources , we assign brightness to their initial directions .",
    "others stay close to the radial line and go to the horizon without meeting one of the light sources ; to their initial directions we assign darkness .",
    "the resulting dark region on the sky is called the _ shadow _ of the black hole .",
    "the boundary of the shadow is determined by light rays that spiral towards a lightlike geodesic which stays on a sphere .",
    "the region outside of the black hole filled with these spherical lightlike geodesics is called the exterior _",
    "photon region_. recently , the shadow of a black has attracted even hollywood s attention . in the movie _ interstellar _ , which was released in 2014",
    ", it was shown how nearby observers would see the shadow of an almost extremal rotating ( kerr ) black hole with an accretion disk@xcite .    in the near future astronomers",
    "actually expect to observe the shadow of a black hole .",
    "currently there are two cooperating projects  the us - led event horizon telescope project@xcite and the european blackholecam project  who try to image the shadow of galactic black holes .",
    "it has been predicted since several years that there are supermassive black holes at the centers of most  if not all  galaxies .",
    "there is strong evidence for a black hole at the center of our own galaxy , associated with the radio source sagittarius  a * ( sgr  a * ) : infrared observations of orbits of stars near the center@xcite demonstrate that there has to be a heavy object with a mass of approximately @xmath2 million solar masses within a small volume .",
    "the most convincing candidate for such an object is a black hole .",
    "another good candidate for a supermassive black hole is the object at the center of m87 ( @xmath3 solar masses ) . because of the large distance",
    ", the diameter of the shadow of galactic black holes will be tiny .",
    "even for the nearest candidate sgr  a * ( @xmath4 away@xcite ) , the predicted diameter of the shadow is only about @xmath5 , see sec .",
    "[ sec : angrad ] .",
    "although tiny , such a diameter should be resolvable with very large baseline interferometry ( vlbi)@xcite .",
    "numerical studies taking scattering into account suggest that the shadow can be observed only at sub - millimeter wavelengths , see falcke , melia and agol@xcite .",
    "the resolution of interferometric measurements in this wavelength regime will be further improved if the 10-meter space - based radio - telescope _",
    "_ millimetron__@xcite goes into operation , probably in the mid-2020s . with this russian satellite",
    "the earth - based telescope network is upgraded with an extra - long space - earth baseline of @xmath6 .",
    "if the shadow of a black hole will be observed , its shape will give important information on the parameters of the black hole .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to provide the observers with theoretical calculations of the shape of the shadow for different black - hole models . in an earlier paper  @xcite , we have given an analytic formula for the shadow of black holes of the plebaski class , which are also known as kerr ",
    "nut(anti-)de sitter space - times .",
    "black holes of this class are characterized by mass , spin , electric or magnetic charge , a nut - parameter and a cosmological constant . in the present paper",
    "we extend this analysis to the bigger class of plebaski  demiaski space - times , which include in addition a so - called acceleration parameter . the plebaski ",
    "demiaski space - times are axially symmetric stationary solutions to the einstein  maxwell equations with a cosmological constant and they are of petrov type d. before determining the boundary curve of the shadow in these space - times , we have to study the photon region .",
    "we develop the relevant formulas for the whole class of plebaski  demiaski space - times . however , when studying the effect of the acceleration parameter onto the photon region and onto the shadow in terms of pictures , we restrict to black holes for which only the mass , the spin and the acceleration parameter are different from zero .",
    "this is because the effect of the other parameters  electric and magnetic charge , nut - parameter and cosmological constant  has been studied already in our earlier paper and the presence of the acceleration does not change this significantly .",
    "the metric of these black hole space - times characterized by mass , spin and acceleration alone is known as the rotating @xmath1-metric or the accelerated kerr metric .",
    "if only the mass and the acceleration parameter are different from zero , we have the so - called @xmath1-metric which describes a space - time with boost - rotation symmetry .",
    "this solution to the vacuum einstein field equation was found by levi - civita ( 1919)@xcite and weyl ( 1919)@xcite .",
    "the name @xmath1-metric refers to the classification in the review of ehlers and kundt ( 1962)@xcite .",
    "the rotating version of the @xmath1-metric was considered by hong and teo@xcite while a detailed discussion of accelerated space - times in general can be found in the book by griffiths and podolsk@xcite .",
    "commonly the @xmath1-metric is given in the form introduced by hong and teo@xcite @xmath7 with cubic functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the metric depends on two parameters , the mass @xmath10 and the acceleration parameter @xmath11 .",
    "the domain covered by the coordinates @xmath12 actually contains _ two _ black holes accelerating away from each other with a conical singularity ( a `` strut '' ) on the axis of rotational symmetry@xcite . for our purposes , boyer ",
    "lindquist coordinates are more suitable , see eq .   below , which cover only one of the two black holes .",
    "there are several earlier papers on the shadows of black holes . here",
    "we just mention some important works , for a more comprehensive list we refer to the introduction of our earlier paper@xcite .",
    "the first analytic calculations of the shadow of a black hole were done by synge@xcite for the schwarzschild metric ( synge used the word `` escape cone '' for the complement of the shadow ) and by bardeen@xcite for the kerr metric . in the schwarzschild case",
    "the photon region reduces to the `` photon sphere '' at @xmath13 and the shadow is circular . in the kerr case ,",
    "the photon region is spatially three - dimensional and the shadow is non - circular .",
    "the deviation of the shadow from a circle could be used as a measure for the spin@xcite . with ray - tracing algorithms",
    "it is possible to include effects of matter on the light rays like emission regions and scattering@xcite .",
    "here we do not take such effects into account but restrict ourselves to the purely geometric construction of the shadow based on the assumption that light rays are lightlike geodesics and that there are no light sources between us and the black hole .",
    "it is our goal to derive an analytical formula for the shape of the shadow from which , in future work , the parameters of the black hole could be extracted with analytical means .    after a discussion of relevant properties of the plebaski ",
