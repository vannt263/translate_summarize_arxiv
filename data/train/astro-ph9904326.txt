    "the nearby spiral galaxy ngc  7331 the main parameters of which are given in table 1 represents a challenge for the observers interested in structure and dynamics of disk galaxies .",
    "it has been observed many times , both photometrically and spectroscopically ; but results of each new approach contradicted often to results of previous ones .",
    "many years ago bosma ( @xcite ) trying to give a general description of ngc  7331 noted that according to sandage ( @xcite ) who saw spiral arms as close to the center as at @xmath4 ngc  7331 is a disk - dominated galaxy ; however the deep photograph reported by arp and kormendy ( @xcite ) revealed a presence of prominent extended bulge .",
    "the problem of the bulge role in ngc  7331 is not solved yet despite numerous photometric studies .",
    "boroson ( @xcite ) estimated a bulge - to - disk ratio as 1.10 by analysing a major - axis surface brightness profile .",
    "kent ( @xcite ) analysed two - dimensional ccd images and proposed a method of bulge - disk decomposition based on different ellipticities of the bulge and disk isophotes ; but he noted that this method is inapplicable to ngc  7331 because in this galaxy the isophotes of the bulge and of the disk demonstrate the same ( ! ) ellipticity .",
    "as a result , he decomposed only the major - axis profile and derived @xmath5 and the disk with a central hole . among recent studies ,",
    "von linden et al . (",
    "@xcite ) have published a surface brightness profile in the @xmath6band extended up to @xmath7 and have concluded that a de vaucouleurs bulge dominates over the whole radius range under consideration , whereas prada et al .",
    "( @xcite ) analysing together @xmath6 and @xmath8images have reached the best fit with the compact bulge , having effective radius of @xmath9 , and two exponential disk components with different characteristic scales which meet at @xmath7 .",
    "so the situation with the morphological characteristics of the bulge in ngc  7331 remains to be uncertain .",
    "a similar uncertainty exists relating to a dynamical status of the bulge in this galaxy : prada et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have found the bulge to counter - rotate with respect to the stellar disk basing on the long - slit observations in the ir triplet spectral range , but mediavilla et al .",
    "( @xcite ) who observed the central part of ngc  7331 with a panoramic fiber spectrograph in two spectral ranges , near mgb and near ir , do not agree stating that the bulge in ngc  7331 corotates the stellar and gaseous disks .",
    ".global parameters of ngc  7331 [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     another question which is an object of discussion for several years : is there a `` dead quasar '' , or supermassive black hole , in the center of ngc  7331 ?",
    "we have begun this discussion ten years ago .",
    "afanasiev et al .",
    "( @xcite ) examining the major - axis profile of line - of - sight velocities of the ionized gas have found that central @xmath10 ( the scale which is comparable to our spatial resolution ) are kinematically decoupled by fast solid - body rotation .",
    "we have checked the axisymmetric character of the gas rotation and have concluded that this fast rotation is caused by a compact mass concentration of order of @xmath11 . to see if a `` dead quasar '' may be in the center of ngc  7331 , bower et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have studied major - axis and minor - axis profiles of stellar velocities .",
    "though the angular rotation velocity of stars in the center of ngc  7331 has been found to be as high as that of the ionized gas , namely , about of 500 km / s / kpc , the very central part of the stellar rotation curve has not appeared to be so distinct .",
    "moreover , the stellar velocity dispersion has not a sharp maximum in the center , as it is the case , for example , in m  31 where the presence of the supermassive black hole in the center is proved ( @xcite ) . on the contrary , in ngc  7331",
    "@xmath12 along the minor axis seems to demonstrate a local minimum at @xmath13 .",
    "so bower et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have concluded that the mass of the central black hole , if exists , must be less than @xmath11 . however , the problem of the black hole presence in the nucleus of ngc  7331 has not been closed : cowan et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have reported a detection of unresolved nuclear radio source in this galaxy which has appeared to be more luminous by a factor of 34 than the famous sgr  a in the center of our galaxy , and recently stockdale et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have claimed an existence of the nuclear x - ray source in ngc  7331  they treat it as a massive black hole .",
    "if it really exists , its dynamical implications must be re - looked for more carefully .",
    "when afanasiev et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have detected a compact mass concentration in the center of ngc  7331 , we have not made a definitive choice between the supermassive black hole and a compact dense stellar subsystem , such as a central star supercluster or circumnuclear stellar disk .",
    "moreover , later we have undertaken a two - dimensional spectrophotometry of the central region of ngc  7331 and have found that its unresolved nucleus is chemically distinct : its magnesium index is much higher than that of the nearest bulge ( @xcite ) . as the",
    "kinematically decoupled nucleus in ngc  7331 has been found to be also chemically distinct , we would like to think it to be a separate stellar subsystem .",
    "so a more careful investigation of stellar population properties in the nucleus and in the circumnuclear region of ngc  7331 must help to clarify the structure and evolution of its center and of the entire galaxy .",
    "we report our observations and other data which we use in section  2 .",
    "the brief description of the ionized - gas morphology in the center of ngc  7331 is given in section  3 .",
    "radial variations of the stellar population age and metal abundances are analysed in section  4 , and the kinematics of ionized gas and stars in the region under consideration is discussed in section  5 .",
    "section  6 presents our conclusions and a brief discussion of our results .",
    "the observations of ngc  7331 which results are presented in this paper have been undertaken with the multi - pupil field spectrograph ( mpfs , @xcite ) of the 6 m telescope of the special astrophysical observatory of the russian academy of sciences in 1996 .",
    "the red spectral range , 63006900   , has been exposed on august 19 , 1996 , during 55 minutes , under the seeing @xmath14 .",
    "the mpfs was equipped with ccd @xmath15 ; we registered simultaneously 95 spectra from an area of @xmath16 , each spectrum corresponding to a spatial element of @xmath17 .",
    "the strongest emission line in the circumnuclear region , [ nii]@xmath186583 , has been measured to construct two - dimensional velocity field of the ionized gas ; we fitted its profile by a single gaussian .",
    "the blue - green spectral range , 41005600   , has been exposed on october 9 , 1996 , during 40 minutes , under the seeing @xmath19 .",
    "the sky has been exposed separately during 20 minutes , properly normalized and subtracted from the galaxy frame .",
    "the mpfs was equipped with ccd @xmath20 ; we registered simultaneously 128 spectra from an area of @xmath21 , each spectrum corresponding to a spatial element of @xmath22 .",
    "this spectral range includes a lot of strong absorption lines , so we have used this exposure to calculate absorption - line indices h@xmath0 , mgb , fe5270 , and fe5335 in the well - known lick system ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have checked our consistency with the lick measurements by observing stars from their list ( @xcite ) and by calculating the absorption - line indices for the stars in the same manner as for the galaxies .",
    "the indices calculated for 9 stars are coincident with the data tabulated in ( @xcite ) in average within 0.05   .",
    "the exposure for the galaxy has been taken long enough to provide a signal - to - noise ratios of @xmath23 60 in the nucleus and @xmath23 1015 near the edge of the frame ; the corresponding random error estimations made in the manner of cardiel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) range from 0.2    in the center to 0.60.7    for the individual spatial elements at the outermost points . to keep a constant level of accuracy along the radius",
    ", we summed the spectra for the galaxies in concentric rings centered onto the nuclei and studied the radial dependencies of the luminosity - weighted properties of stars by comparing the observational index values to those from the synthetic models of old stellar populations of worthey ( @xcite ) and tantalo et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we estimate the mean accuracy of our azimuthally - averaged indices as 0.10.2   . besides",
    ", we have cross - correlated each elementary spectrum with the spectrum of the late - type star ads  15470 ( the brighter component ) and have obtained two - dimensional velocity field for the stellar component of the central region of ngc  7331 .",
    "the reciprocal dispersion during these observations was 1.6    per pix , and the spectral resolution varied slightly over the field of view from 3.5    to 5   .",
    "as a result , we estimate our accuracy of the elementary line - of - sight velocities as 2025 km / s . however , our spectral resolution allowed to obtain only luminosity - weighted mean line - of - sight velocitites ; we were not able to separate kinematical components similar to the counterrotating bulge reported by prada et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .    to refine kinematical analysis ,",
    "we have involved high - resolution long - slit data from the la palma archive .",
    "the galaxy has been observed on july 19 , 1996 , with the isis ( red arm ) equipped with ccd tek @xmath24 at the william herschel telescope .",
    "the near - infrared spectral range , 83608750   , containing the strong caii absorption - line triplet , has been exposed : 60 min in the @xmath25 ( major axis ) and 30 min in the @xmath26 ( minor axis ) .",
    "the slit width was @xmath27 ; the reciprocal dispersion of 0.39    per pix provided spectral resolution of 1.0   .",
    "a star hr  8656 ( k0iii ) was observed during the same night ; we have cross - correlated the galaxy spectra row - by - row with the spectrum of this star after binning by three pixels ( with the final spatial step of @xmath28 ) , sky subtracting and transforming into velocity scale .",
    "the subsequent gauss analysis of obviously multi - component losvds ( line - of - sight velocity distributions ) has allowed to extract several kinematical components along the slit aligned with the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "the basic reduction steps  bias subtraction , flatfielding , cosmic ray hit removing , extraction of one - dimensional spectra , wavelength calibration , construction of surface brightness maps  have been fulfiled by using the software developed in the special astrophysical observatory ( @xcite ) . to calculate the absorption - line indices and to map them we have used our own programs as well as the fortran program of dr .  vazdekis .",
    "fig .  1 shows raw observational data  so called `` data cube ''  in the red spectral range .",
    "one can see immediately that a characteristic ratio of emission lines , @xmath29-to-[nii]@xmath186583 , indicates a liner - like excitation inside the central region , roughly @xmath30 , but a rather strong present star formation already in @xmath31 to the east ( along the minor axis ) from the nucleus .",
    "this fact contradicts to the claims of keel ( @xcite ) who observed the spectra in @xmath32 to the north , south , and east ( ! ) from the nucleus and everywhere had found the dominance of [ nii]@xmath186583 over h@xmath33 .",
    "but his aperture , @xmath34 , was perhaps too large to distinguish between the central shock - excited gaseous disk and nearby star - forming sites which are concentrated in a ring with a deprojected radius of @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 on the sky plane along the minor axis ) .",
    "this ring is presented best of all in the recent paper of smith ( @xcite ) .",
    "it looks quite identical at different wavelengths : on the h@xmath33+[nii ] map from pogge ( @xcite ) , on the 15@xmath37 m map from smith ( @xcite ) , on the nobeyama co ( 1 - 0 ) map from tosaki and shioya ( @xcite ) , and on the 20 cm radio continuum map from cowan et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . obviously , this multiple coincidence together with h@xmath33/[nii]@xmath38 in our fig .",
    "1 proves that this ring contains sites of intense present star formation , including formation of massive stars .",
    "if we accept the surface - brightness profile decomposition from boroson ( @xcite ) or from baggett et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , this star - forming ring is located well inside the bulge - dominated area .",
    "the nature of the very central region is not so obvious .",
    "2 presents isophotes of the [ nii ] emission - line surface brightness distribution obtained with the mpfs .",
    "they are elongated and repeat approximately the shape of continuum isophotes .",
    "the consistent results are obtained by mediavilla et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ( see their fig .",
    "9 ) ; even an asymmetry `` north - south '' is the same .",
    "keel ( @xcite ) also mentioned a gaseous disk with the radius of @xmath39 having the diffuse extension up to @xmath32 aligned in the @xmath40 , close to the line - of - nodes orientation .",
    "interestingly , the similar elongated structure , with the major - axis diameter of @xmath41 , is present on the 15@xmath37 m map of smith ( @xcite ) , but the sense of the north - south asymmetry is opposite with respect to the [ nii ] map .",
    "probably , the explanation of this asymmetry by the dust concentration to the south from the nucleus given by mediavilla et al .",
    "( @xcite ) is correct .",
    "there are no either hi ( @xcite ) nor co ( tosaki & shioya @xcite ) inside this circumnuclear structure ; also it is undetected in radio ( cowan et al .",
    "therefore , there is no detectable present star formation there ; but the gas is probably shock - excited , and the dust is warm . as the structure",
    "is aligned with the line of nodes , we would like to treat it preliminarily as a circumnuclear gaseous disk .",
    "figure  3 presents isolines of the surface distributions in the central @xmath42 area for the green ( 5100   ) continuum and three absorption - line indices , mgb , @xmath43 ( fe5270+fe5335)/2 , and h@xmath0 .",
    "the continuum isophotes show a strange asymmetry : within @xmath44 from the center eastern halves of them seem to be more tightly packed than their western halves .",
    "it looks like a some extracomponent of light to the west from the nucleus .",
    "interestingly , on larger scales the sense of isophote crowding is opposite due to global dust concentration on the western side of the galaxy ( boroson @xcite , smith @xcite ) .",
    "the magnesium - index isolines are rather roundish ; the distribution is strongly peaked on the nucleus of the galaxy ( ngc  7331 has a chemically distinct nucleus , as we noted earlier , @xcite ) .",
    "but the surface distribution of another metal - line index , @xmath1 , is quite different from that of mgb and can partly explain an asymmetry of the continuum isophotes . in fig .",
    "3c we clearly see a compact fe - rich disk shifted to the west from the nucleus ( or do we see only its western half ? ) .",
    "a strong north - south asymmetry is present too .",
    "if we assume that we see only south - western quarter of the disk , its radius may be as large as @xmath45 .",
    "this size agrees with the size of the central mid - infrared structure ( smith @xcite ) .",
    "but what is the most interesting thing , it is the similar surface distribution of the hydrogen - line index h@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "3d ) : the circumnuclear fe - rich disk is also distinguished by the very prominent balmer absorption line . since iron and hydrogen absorption lines in integrated spectra",
    "are unmatched being produced by different groups of stars , the similarity of the fig .",
    "3c and fig .",
    "3d may signify that the circumnuclear fe - rich stellar disk is rather young .",
    "let us look at what state - of - art diagnostics of the stellar population properties can tell us .    to compare our measurements to the stellar population models based on summation ( with some weights ) of spectra of stars",
    ", we must made corrections for the stellar velocity dispersion in galaxies which broadens absorption lines and `` degrades '' a spectral resolution in such way .",
    "we have calculated the correction by smoothing the spectra of k0-k3 iii giants from the list of ( @xcite ) which we have observed and by measuring the absorption - line indices of the smoothed spectra .",
    "we have found that the index h@xmath0 is quite insensitive to the velocity dispersion when @xmath46 remains to be less than 230 km / s ; as for the metal - line indices , we have found the correction to be 0.1    for @xmath46=130 km / s which is typical for the central part of ngc  7331 ( bower et al .",
    "figures  4 and 5 contains the corrected indices .",
    "the most popular models of worthey ( @xcite ) allow to disentangle age and metallicity of old stellar populations by confronting some metal - line indices ( e. g. mgb , @xmath1 , or [ mgfe]@xmath47 ) with the balmer - line index h@xmath0 ; but these models have been calculated for the solar magnesium - to - iron ratio . to use the worthey s",
    "( @xcite ) models , we must be sure that the stellar population has solar magnesium - to - iron ratio .",
    "figure  4 presents the diagram ( fe5270 , mgb ) where we compare azimuthally - averaged ( in circular rings centered onto the nucleus ) index measurements in ngc  7331 with the models of worthey ( @xcite ) for the solar magnesium - to - iron ratio . since the circumnuclear fe - rich disk seen in figs .",
    "3c and 3d is located asymmetrically with respect to the nucleus and contributes only partially to the ring - integrated estimates at @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we have also plotted individual - element measurements related to this disk though they are less accurate than azimuthally - averaged ones .",
    "one can see from fig .  4 that the nucleus of ngc  7331 is surely magnesium - overabundant .",
    "the mg / fe ratio for the azimuthally - averaged measurements at @xmath48 and @xmath49 is obviously lower than that for the nucleus , but is it solar or not , depends on the stellar population age .",
    "farther from the nucleus , at @xmath50 , the moderate magnesium overabundance can also be seen .",
    "interestingly , the proper measurements of the circumnuclear fe - rich disk lie much higher that the azimuthally - averaged points : the disk has the solar mg - to - fe ratio if it is as young as 2 billion years old and is iron - overabundant if it is older .    taking in mind all said above , let us try to determine mean ages of stars in the nucleus and at different distances from the center .",
    "figures  5a , 5b , and 5c present various diagrams which may be useful for this purpose . as the nucleus is magnesium - overabundant , the models of worthey ( @xcite )",
    "are inapplicable for it ; in fig .",
    "5a we have plotted the calculations of tantalo et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for [ mg / fe]=+0.3 . from comparison with these models on the diagram ( h@xmath0 , @xmath1 )",
    "one can see that the mean age of the nuclear stellar population in ngc  7331 is 5 billion years , and its global metal content , @xmath51 , is close to the solar value .",
    "5b shows also the models from tantalo et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , but for the solar magnesium - to - iron ratio ; the locations of the azimuthally - averaged points at the @xmath48 and @xmath49 imply similarly a rather young age for the nearest neighborhood of the nucleus .",
    "the elementary measurements related to the circumnuclear fe - rich disk , though well scattered , nevertheless all lie above the model sequence with the age of 5 billion years . the next fig .",
    "5c presenting the diagram ( h@xmath0 , [ mgfe ] ) with the models of worthey ( @xcite ) calculated under [ mg / fe]=0 confirms that four individual points for the circumnuclear fe - rich disk agree with the age estimate of 2 billion years and the overall metallicity at least twice the solar one . if we return now to fig .  4",
    ", we should conclude that the circumnuclear `` fe - rich '' disk has indeed [ mg / fe]=0 under the assumption of @xmath52 billion years .    the work of tantalo et al .",
    "( @xcite ) proposes also a possibility to quantify differences of stellar population properties basing on the index differences .",
    "a set of three linear equations , connecting @xmath53[mg / fe ] , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 to the @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , is written .",
    "we apply these equations to the differences between the nucleus and the bulge ; the bulge is safely taken at the following values of radius , at @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , namely , outside the circumnuclear `` fe - rich '' disk but well inside the star - forming ring .",
    "solely , one must take in mind that the index measurements at @xmath63 are twice less precise than the more inner ones so they can be used mostly as a check .",
    "having performed the set of calculations , we have obtained the parameter differences listed in table  2 .",
    "they mean that the bulge is twice older and more metal - poor by a factor of 2.54 than the nucleus .",
    "surprisingly , the mg / fe ratios are almost equal in the nucleus and in the bulge .",

    "( @xcite ) , we can only refer to our better spectral resolution  35 km / s ( their spectral resolution was reported as 52 km / s ) .    fig .",
    "8a displays the results of gauss analysis of the losvd along the major axis @xmath25 together with stellar velocity profiles derived without component separation , namely , together with the recent data of heraudeau & simien ( @xcite ) obtained under seeing of @xmath99 and with the simulated one - dimensional profile calculated from our mpfs two - dimensional velocity field shown in fig .",
    "6a . by analysing the long - slit data ,",
    "we have extracted three kinematical components .",
    "the first , fast - rotating component dominates over the full range of radii . since according to prada et al .",
    "( @xcite ) at @xmath100 its stellar velocity dispersion does not exceed 70 km / s , we would treat it as a disk . the second component , corotating with the first one and seen at @xmath100 , rotates much slower than the first one , so we would conclude that it is an ordinary bulge ; but it dominates nowhere , and that is very strange for the early - type spiral galaxy with extended photometric bulge .",
    "interestingly , its nearly solid - body slow rotation up to @xmath101 matches perfectly the rotation of the ionized gas at @xmath102 ( see fig .  1 in our work , afanasiev et al .",
    "@xcite , or the lower resolution h@xmath33 data in @xcite ) while the rotation curve of the dominant stellar component , disk , diverges strongly with the gas rotation curve .",
    "finally , the third component counter - rotates with respect to the main stellar and gaseous rotation ; it is just the same component which was reported by prada et al .",
    "( @xcite ) as a `` retrograde bulge '' .",
    "but there is some ambiguity with this diagnosis : in their conclusions prada et al .",
    "( @xcite ) stated that `` the inner parts of the galaxy consists of a boxy component , dominating the inner @xmath103 .",
    "it shows position angle twisting , rotates retrograde to the rest of the galaxy , and is rounder '' ; meantime the retrograde component is seen only in the narrow radius range @xmath104 according both to the data of prada et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and ours ! besides , its velocity dispersion is as low as that of the disk ( prada et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and it rotates faster than the prograde bulge though slower than the disk .",
    "so it does not resemble a bulge ; it must be a rather flat structure .",
    "the central @xmath103 contains only one inseparable component ; but at @xmath105 it meets perfectly the disk component . as it looks like a straight solid - body rotation curve , we would identify it with a central part of the disk rotation profile . an increased velocity dispersion inside @xmath73 which has been reported by prada et al .",
    "( @xcite ) is probably a result of adding slower rotating , weaker components .",
    "however , we can conclude that from a dynamical point of view the disk dominates over the whole central region of ngc  7331 .",
    "we can summarize our conclusions as follows . in the sb galaxy ngc  7331",
    "the stellar disk is a kinematical component dominating over the full radius range .",
    "the bulge is less prominent though it can be traced up to @xmath106 ( 3.3 kpc ) ; its slow solid - body rotation is very similar to the main rotation of the ionized gas . we confirm also an existence of the counter - rotating stellar component in the radius range of @xmath107 ( 400  1500 pc ) .",
    "the central part of the disk inside @xmath2 ( 200 pc )  or a separate circumnuclear stellar - gaseous disk as it is distinguished by decoupled fast rotation of the ionized gas  is very metal - rich , rather young , @xmath3 billion years old , and its solar magnesium - to - iron ratio evidences for a very long duration of the last episode of star formation there .",
    "however the gas excitation mechanism in this disk now is shock - like .",
    "the star - like nucleus had probably experienced a secondary star formation burst too : its age is 5 billion years , much younger than the age of the circumnuclear bulge . but [ mg / fe]=+0.3 and only solar global metallicity imply that the nuclear star formation burst has been much shorter than that in the circumnuclear disk .    up to now two - dimensional mapping of the absorption - line equivalent widths ( or indices )",
    "is rarely used to investigate stellar population properties in galaxies .",
    "practically unique examples of such approach are a long - slit combined study of the center of m  31 by davidge ( @xcite ) and a detailed tiger investigation of ngc  4594 by emsellem et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the latter case appears to be something similar to the case of ngc  7331 : the magnesium - index map of the center of ngc  4594 demonstrates a point - like peak in the nucleus of the galaxy , and the iron indices are roughly constant along the major axis up to the border of the area investigated , @xmath73 ( emsellem et al .",
    "so the isolines of the iron indices in ngc  4594 present something like the fe - rich circumnuclear stellar disk found by us in ngc  7331 . though the measurements of mgb index in ngc  4594 are complicated by a presence of the rather strong emission line [ ni]@xmath185199 ( emsellem et al .",
    "@xcite ) and though two examples are not a statistics yet , perhaps , there exists some evolutionary sense in different morphologies of magnesium- and iron - index surface distributions .",
    "an interesting problem is an origin of the counter - rotating component .",
    "usually counter - rotating stellar substructures are considered as a result of merger . some merger event could also provoke a secondary star formation burst in the center of the galaxy in this way producing the chemically distinct nucleus and , if the merger was dissipative , the inclined circumnuclear disk .",
    "however , the circumnuclear fe - rich disk in ngc  7331 rotates in the same sense as the rest of the galaxy and so can not be genetically related to the counter - rotating component .",
    "recently we have found a counter - rotating stellar component in the nearby spiral galaxy ngc  2841 ( @xcite ) .",
    "ngc  2841 and ngc  7331 look almost twins : the same morphological type , sb , the same size and luminosity , the same inclination .",
    "they were the first galaxies where a global ring - like distribution of co has been detected ( @xcite ) .",
    "analysing the major - axis long - slit cross - section of ngc  2841 , we have found two kinematical components in the bulge : strong prograde one which dominates up to @xmath108 and weak retrograde one ( @xcite ) .",
    "a set of other phenomena allow us to suggest an existence of extended triaxial bulge almost aligned with the line of nodes of the global disk in this galaxy , and we have thought the counter - rotating stellar component to be an intrinsic property of a slightly tumbling triaxial potential .",
    "perhaps the similar situation takes place in ngc  7331 ; the only difference is that in ngc  7331 the disk dominates over the full radius range whereas in ngc  2841 the bulge is more prominent .",
    "a hypothesis of the bar presence in the center of ngc  7331 has already been proposed by von linden et al .",
    "( @xcite ) to explain a central depletion of molecular gas in this galaxy .",
    "besides , the french team ( @xcite ) have constructed a global two - dimensional velocity field of the ionized gas in ngc  7331 from their observations of h@xmath33 emission line with a scanning fabry - perot interferometer and have found a strong large - scale turn of the isovelocities which is usually treated as a signature of bar presence . now we can add another argument in favor of a triaxial potential aligned with the line of nodes : inside @xmath109 the gas in ngc  7331 rotates more slowly than the stellar disk , and it is valid both for the ionized gas ( @xcite , afanasiev et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) and for the molecular gas ( von linden et al .",
    "@xcite ) . since the emission lines are narrow ( below the spectral resolution ) and the gas seems to be well - settled to the global plane of the galaxy ( bosma @xcite , von linden et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the only explanation can be non - circular rotation of the gas caused by the triaxial potential of the bulge . the stronger response of the gaseous disk to the triaxial potential of the bulge when compared to the response of the stellar disk may be explained by a viscous nature of the gas and by a significant self - gravitation of the massive stellar disk of ngc  7331 which is a dominant dynamical component in this galaxy .",
    "interestingly , the solid - body part of the gas rotation curve , or a zone of non - circular motions as we think , ends at @xmath110  exactly at the ring of molecular gas , warm dust , and intense star formation which we have discussed in section  3 .",
    "the configuration looks like an hii ring around a bar which is often observed in classic barred galaxies .",
    "probably , the low - contrast triaxial bulge extends up to @xmath111 from the center in ngc  7331 .",
    "the last interesting question concerns a possible presence of the black hole in the center of ngc  7331 . in afanasiev",
    "( @xcite ) we argued that the fast decoupled axisymmetric rotation of the ionized gas inside @xmath112 proved strong mass concentration in the nucleus ; this mass concentration might be a black hole .",
    "but bower et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have noticed no decoupled rotation by studying a stellar component ; and what is the most important , they have not found a peak of stellar velocity dispersion in the nucleus . how can we agree gas and star behaviours ? in afanasiev et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , zasov and silchenko ( @xcite ) we noted that a misaligned minibar in the center of a galaxy may mimic a presence of kinematically decoupled nucleus by increasing a visible central slope of the major - axis velocity profile due to non - circular motions .",
    "but in ngc  7331 the situation is more complex : the rotation of the gas and stars in the very center is circular , and the bar effect ( non - circular gas motions ) is felt only outside the zone of decoupled rotation . however",
    ", the result is the same : the nucleus looks kinematically decoupled though no point - like central mass concentration is required for this . by summarizing , since cowan et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and stockdale et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have found the unresolved radio- and x - ray source in the center of ngc  7331 , it may be a black hole , but it can not be a _ supermassive _ black hole , like those in ngc  4594 , ngc  3115 , and m  87 , because its dynamical influence is nowadays indeterminate .",
    "as supermassive black holes are now detected in some three dozens galaxies , a correlation is found between black hole mass and galactic spheroid luminosity . by using this relation taken e. g. from cattaneo et al .",
    "( @xcite ) one can try to estimate a possible black hole mass in the center of ngc  7331 .",
    "unfortunately , as we have noted in the introduction , the bulge - disk decomposition in ngc  7331 is ambiguous : if the bulge is large as boroson ( @xcite ) or baggett et al .",
    "( @xcite ) reported , the black hole mass may be @xmath113 , if it is small like that reported by prada et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , the mean relation @xmath114 vs. @xmath115 implies @xmath116 for ngc  7331 .",
    "if we take also into account the large scatter of this relation ( cattaneo et al .",
    ", @xcite , give @xmath117 ) and the impression that the @xmath114 estimates for spiral galaxies lie all below the mean relation defined mostly by ellipticals , the mass of the black hole in the center of ngc  7331 may be as small as @xmath118 .",
    "this value contributes only several percents into the total mass of the circumnuclear disk ( @xmath119 , afanasiev et al . , @xcite ) , so it may be undetectable in kinematical studies of moderate spatial resolution like ours .",
