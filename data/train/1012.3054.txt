    "a theoretical approach for electronic structure calculations on systems with spiral magnetic structures within the kkr green s function formalism has been presented .",
    "as has been demonstrated , by making use of symmetry , the scattering path operator can be obtained by solving the corresponding equation of motion in the reciprocal space .",
    "compared to the case of collinear magnetic structure only the structural green s function to be used involves the wave vector of the spin spiral . as the kkr - formalism combined with the cpa allows to deal with chemically disordered materials , corresponding spin spiral investigations on various disordered alloys could be performed .",
    "in particular the energy of spin spirals and the behavior of the magnetic moments of the alloy components was analyzed .",
    "in addition is was shown that the approach presented can be efficiently used for the calculation of the momentum resolved longitudinal magnetic susceptibilities of pure materials as well as of disordered alloys .",
    "this work was supported by the dfg within the project eb 154/20 `` spin polarisation in heusler alloy based spintronics systems probed by spinaxpes '' ."
