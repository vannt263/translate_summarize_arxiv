    "the crystal structure of ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 is formed by [ vop@xmath0o@xmath1 ] layers separated by silver cations .",
    "the structure has monoclinic symmetry ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 a , @xmath7  a , @xmath8 a , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) .",
    "one unit cell contains two layers and , in particular , four vanadium atoms  two from each of the layers ( fig .",
    "[ fig - structure ] ) .",
    "every layer includes vo@xmath11 octahedra joined by po@xmath3 tetrahedra .",
    "vanadium has the oxidation state of + 4 corresponding to the electronic configuration @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath13.@xcite magnetic measurements down to 77 k indicate paramagnetic behavior of ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1,@xcite but , as we will show in the following , considerable deviation from the curie law starts immediately below this temperature .",
    "to understand the possible magnetic interactions in ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 , one has to consider the local environment of vanadium atoms as well as the connections between vanadium polyhedra .",
    "the vo@xmath11 octahedra are strongly distorted due to the formation of a short v ",
    "o bond typical for v@xmath14 ( see ref . ) .",
    "the distortion of the octahedron results in a non - degenerate orbital ground state with the half - filled @xmath15 orbital lying in the equatorial plane of the octahedron,@xcite i.e. , almost parallel to the [ vop@xmath0o@xmath1 ] layers .    the orientation of the half - filled orbital implies that interlayer interactions should be negligibly small while the magnitude of in - layer interactions depends on the connections between the vanadium octahedra . according to fig .",

    "one can consider such a system as an alternating zigzag chain ( see bottom panel of fig .",

    "polycrystalline samples of ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 were prepared according to the procedure reported in ref . .",
    "stoichiometric amounts of agno@xmath18 , ( nh@xmath19hpo@xmath3 , and vo@xmath0 were carefully mixed , placed in corundum crucibles and annealed in air .",
    "the regime of the annealing was as follows : 12 hours at 200 @xmath20c , 1 day at 400 @xmath20c , and 1 day at 500 @xmath20c with regrindings after each step .",
    "the final product was a single phase as checked by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) ( huber g670f camera , cuk@xmath21 radiation , imageplate detector ) .",
    "however , the xrd pattern revealed a rather high background signal that probably indicated low crystallinity of the prepared samples or the presence of amorphous impurities .",
    "unfortunately , we failed to improve the quality of the samples , since further annealings ( in air or in vacuum ) did not lead to any notable changes in the xrd patterns or resulted in the appearance of non - identified impurity peaks .",
    "we also tried to prepare an isostructural compound na@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 ( ref . ) but the samples always contained a mixture of two polymorphic modifications [ one is isostructural to ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 while the other one has fresnoite - type structure ( see ref .  ) ] .",
    "magnetic susceptibility was measured using quantum design squid between 2 and 300 k in the fields @xmath22 of 0.5 , 1 , and 5 t.    scalar - relativistic density - functional ( dft ) band structure calculations were performed using a full - potential local - orbital scheme@xcite ( fplo5.00 - 19 ) and the exchange - correlation potential of perdew and wang.@xcite ag@xmath23 , v@xmath24 , p@xmath25 , and o@xmath26 orbitals were employed as the basis set , while all lower - lying orbitals were treated as core states .",
    "the @xmath27 mesh included 864 points within the first brillouin zone ( 296 in its irreducible part ) .",
    "the convergence with respect to the number of @xmath27 points was carefully checked .",
    "first , a lda calculation was performed employing the crystallographic unit cell and the full symmetry of the crystal structure ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "orbital states relevant for magnetic interactions were chosen on the basis of the lda band structure and the respective bands were analyzed using a tight - binding model . such analysis provided an estimate for the magnitudes of all nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor exchange couplings in ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "we found that the values of interest were @xmath28 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - structure ] ) , in agreement with the empirical structural considerations listed in sec . [ structure ] .",
    "next we turned to the lsda+@xmath29 technique in order to calculate total energies for several patterns of spin ordering and to give an independent estimate of the leading exchange interactions in ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "such an estimate requires doubling of the lattice translation in the @xmath30 direction ( see section [ band ] ) .",
    "the doubling of the crystallographic unit cell results in @xmath31 and 104 atoms making the calculations very time - consuming and less accurate .",
    "therefore , we slightly simplified the crystal structure in our lsda+@xmath29 calculations .",
    "the simplification was justified by the similarity of lda band structures and tight - binding models for the crystallographic unit cell and the supercell ( i.e. , the modified cell ) .",
    "the neighboring layers in ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 are not translationally equivalent , but they _ are _ equivalent by symmetry , hence they reveal identical in - layer interactions .",
    "interlayer interactions are very weak ( see sec . [ band ] ) , therefore the unit cell with one layer is actually sufficient for the present computational purpose .",
    "we use a @xmath32 supercell with @xmath33 a , @xmath34 a ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 a , and @xmath37 .",
    "the supercell includes one [ vop@xmath0o@xmath1 ] layer that _ exactly _ matches the layer in the real structure .",
    "however , the local environment of silver atoms is changed , and the @xmath38 parameter is slightly elongated as compared to @xmath39 in order to avoid unreasonably short ag  o distances .",
    "the modification of the crystal structure is a strong but _",
    "well justified _ approximation , since silver atoms do not take part in superexchange pathways , while the geometry of the v ",
    "o framework ( crucial for magnetic interactions ) is unchanged .",
    "these conclusions are supported by similar tight - binding fits of the relevant bands in lda band structures for the crystallographic unit cell and the supercell .",
    "the variation of the respective hopping parameters does not exceed 5% , hence the error for @xmath40 s is below 10% ( i.e. , within the typical accuracy of lsda+@xmath29 ) .",
    "another problematic point of lsda+@xmath29 calculations deals with the choice of the coulomb repulsion parameter @xmath41 [ we use the notation @xmath41 in order to distinguish this parameter of the computational method from the model parameter @xmath42 for the coulomb repulsion in the effective one - band model ( see sec . [ band ] ) ] .",
    "below , we use several physically reasonable values of @xmath41 ( namely , 4 , 5 , and 6 ev ) in order to check the influence of @xmath41 on the resulting exchange integrals .",
    "the exchange parameter of lsda+@xmath29 is fixed at @xmath43 ev , as usually it has no significant influence on the results .",
    "magnetic susceptibility curves for ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - suscept ] .",
    "the curves reveal a maximum at @xmath44 k and a fast decrease from @xmath45 down to 5 k indicating spin - gap - like behavior .",
    "below 5 k the susceptibility increases ( at low fields ) or remains nearly temperature - independent ( at 5 t ) .",
    "the samples under investigation are powders , therefore the low - temperature part of the data is dominated by the contribution of paramagnetic impurities and defects saturated at high field .",
    "the susceptibility curves above 2.2 k do not show any anomalies that could denote long - range magnetic ordering.@xcite a weak bend is present on the low - field curve below 2.2 k , but the present data ( collected above 2 k ) are not sufficient to reveal the origin of this bend .",
    "thus , the susceptibility data for ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 reveal low - dimensional spin - gap - like behavior consistent with the scheme of magnetic interactions proposed in sec .",
    "[ structure ] .",
    "the alternation of nearest - neighbor interactions @xmath46 and @xmath47 causes the formation of the spin gap .",
    "the high - temperature part of the susceptibility ( above 60 k ) shows the curie - weiss type behavior , although the @xmath48 _ vs. _ @xmath49 curves are nonlinear due to considerable temperature - independent contribution .",
    "we fit the data above 100 k as @xmath50 and find @xmath51 emu / mol , @xmath52 emu@xmath53k / mol , and @xmath54  k. the curie constant @xmath55 corresponds to the effective moment of @xmath56 that is slightly lower than the expected spin - only value of @xmath57 .",
    "the discrepancy may be caused by the presence of nonmagnetic impurities in the samples under investigation , and this explanation is additionally supported by high diamagnetic contribution @xmath58 as well as by the slightly decreased @xmath59 value ( see below ) .",
    "we suggest that the high diamagnetic contribution is caused by the preparation procedure , since the samples are heated in air , i.e. , in oxidative conditions favoring the formation of diamagnetic v@xmath60 .",
    "unfortunately , annealing in vacuum did not result in single - phase samples .",

    "the dash - dotted line is the fit with the htse ( ref . ) above 10 k. ]    now , we fit the experimental data with model expressions .",
    "basically , one should use the model of the alternating zigzag chain , as suggested by structural considerations in sec .",
    "[ structure ] .",
    "however , only high - temperature series expansion ( htse ) results are available for the susceptibility of this model.@xcite we find a perfect fit of the experimental data above 10 k ( see fig . [ fig - suscept ] ) with @xmath61 , @xmath62 k , @xmath63 k , @xmath64 k , and @xmath65 emu / mol ( temperature - independent contribution ) .",
    "note that we have assumed @xmath66 : at the stage of fitting , this choice is , of course , arbitrary , and one may invert the assumption without any change in the results .",
    "one should not be surprised by the use of the htse for temperatures well below @xmath46 , as the expansion under consideration is valid down to @xmath67 ( see ref . ) .",
    "moreover , the data below the susceptibility maximum ( i.e. , below 20 k ) are crucial for the stability of the fitting and the obtaining of reasonable exchange couplings .",
    "unfortunately , the htse is inapplicable in the low - temperature region . to fit the decrease of the susceptibility between 20 and 5 k",
    ", we have to turn to a simplified model .",
    "if one neglects @xmath17 , ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 becomes an alternating chain system .",
    "the experimental data above 5  k are fitted with the expression : @xmath68 where @xmath58 is the temperature - independent contribution , @xmath69 accounts for the curie - like paramagnetism of impurities and defects , while @xmath70 is the susceptibility of an @xmath13 alternating chain as given in ref . .",
    "the term @xmath70 includes three variable parameters : @xmath71 , and the alternation coefficient @xmath72 .",
    "again , we assume @xmath66 , then @xmath73 and @xmath74 . we find a perfect fit of the experimental data above 5 k ( fit 1 in fig .",

    "[ fig - suscept ] ; the parameters are listed in the second row of table [ table - fit ] ) , but the data between 5 and 8 k are poorly described .",
    "however , the second fit presents a somewhat better @xmath59 value that is close to the expected range of 1.931.96 ( see refs . and ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath59 may be decreased due to the presence of nonmagnetic impurities in the sample under investigation ( as shown by the curie - weiss fit above ) or due to the neglect of @xmath17 .",

    "fit 1 and fit 2 are marked according to fig .",
    "[ fig - suscept ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the hopping parameters ( indicating the width of the half - filled bands ) are two orders of magnitude smaller than the coulomb repulsion ; therefore , we may use the lsda+@xmath29 technique to account for correlation effects within band structure calculations in a mean - field approximation .",
    "four patterns of spin ordering ( see fig . [ fig - patterns ] ) were used in order to estimate @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the resulting exchange integrals are listed in table [ table - integrals ] .",
    "the absolute values of @xmath40 s depend on @xmath41 considerably , but qualitatively the results are similar . we find that @xmath46 is indeed the strongest coupling , it exceeds @xmath77 at least by a factor of 6 .",
    "@xmath46 is the interaction corresponding to longer v  v separation ( 5.29 a _ vs. _ 4.92 a for @xmath47 ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - structure ] .",
    "the small value of @xmath17 is consistent with the tight - binding results and provides a further justification for the fitting of experimental data with the alternating chain model ( see sec .",
    "[ experimental ] ) .",
    "all the interactions in ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 are antiferromagnetic .    as we have mentioned in sec .",
    "[ method ] , the choice of @xmath41 is a problematic point of the lsda+@xmath29 approach .",
    "the @xmath41 parameter is usually fitted to experimentally observed properties ( e.g. , energy gaps , magnetic moments ) or estimated by means of constrained lda calculation ( see , for example , ref . ) .",
    "basically , the choice of @xmath41 remains somewhat ambiguous and depends on the particular experimentally observed quantities used for the fitting as well as structural features and the computational method .",
    "the results for @xmath78 ev show the best agreement with the experimental and tight - binding estimates of @xmath40 s .",
    "note also that the largest energy gap of 2.3 ev found for @xmath78 ev seems to be consistent with the green color of ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "these findings are somewhat unexpected since we used @xmath79 ev , and even smaller @xmath80 ev had been applied in lsda+@xmath29 calculations for vanadium oxides before.@xcite however , one should always keep in mind that @xmath42 and @xmath41 are different quantities having different physical meaning .",
    "@xmath42 is an effective repulsion in a mixed vanadium - oxygen band , while the repulsive potential @xmath41 is applied to v @xmath81 orbitals only .",
    "thus , @xmath41 should exceed @xmath42 , since @xmath42 corresponds to `` molecular ''  v  o orbitals having larger spatial extension as compared to that of atomic v @xmath81 orbitals . as for",
    "the previous lsda+@xmath29 calculations for vanadium oxides,@xcite the difference in computational methods and crystal structures may be relevant .",
    "the linearized muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) basis is used in ref . , while we apply a different basis of local orbitals . moreover , korotin _ _ et al.__@xcite studied layered compounds containing v@xmath14 in square - pyramidal coordination , while vanadium is surrounded by six oxygen atoms in ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "thus , the difference in the optimal @xmath41 value is plausible , although the origin of this difference is not completely clear .",
    "experimental data and band structure calculations provide a consistent microscopic scenario for the magnetic interactions in ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "one of the nearest - neighbor couplings ( @xmath46 ) is about 30 k and exceeds the other couplings at least by a factor of 6 .",
    "thus , ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 may be considered as a system of weakly coupled dimers . indeed , a simple model of isolated dimers [ with additional terms @xmath82 similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq - fit ] ) ] with @xmath83 and @xmath84 k perfectly fits the experimental data above 5 k. this fit completely matches fit 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig - suscept ] .",
    "interdimer interactions @xmath47 and @xmath17 may be responsible for the slight variation of the @xmath59 value , and they certainly influence the possible onset of the long - range ordering . the htse fit and band structure calculations indicate that both @xmath47 and @xmath17 are antiferromagnetic , therefore frustration should be expected . however , it will not change the main feature of ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1  a spin - gap - type magnetic behavior due to strong intradimer coupling .",
    "( color online ) four patterns of spin ordering employed for the calculation of @xmath40 s with lsda+@xmath29 .",
    "dash - dotted rectangles show the repetition unit ( i.e. the supercell ) .",
    "circles denote vanadium atoms ; full and empty circles mark different spin directions . ]",
    "the identification of weakly coupled spin dimers in ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 is surprising , since two nearest - neighbor interactions  @xmath46 and @xmath47  have very similar superexchange pathways .",
    "the differences in interatomic distances and angles for these v  o  p  o  v connections do not exceed 0.05 a and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "nevertheless , the tiny structural changes strongly influence the values of the exchange integrals .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction , superexchange pathways in vanadium phosphates are sometimes non - straightforward .",
    "however , some clarity may be achieved by considering two assumptions .",
    "first , v  o  p  o  v superexchange pathways are often much more efficient than v  o  v ones .",
    "second , the magnitude of interactions involving po@xmath3 tetrahedra can be estimated using structural parameters [ via the so - called magnetostructural correlations , see refs . and ] .",
    "these correlations suggest that double phosphate bridges ( i.e. , two po@xmath3 tetrahedra linking two vo@xmath11 octahedra ) are usually more efficient compared to single bridges , while the interactions via double bridges depend on the relative orientation of vanadium and phosphorous polyhedra quantified by several geometrical parameters . the present study may provide a good test for such structural considerations concerning magnetic interactions in systems with complex superexchange pathways .    in case of ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 ,",
    "double phosphate bridges are relevant for both @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "most geometrical parameters are similar for these interactions , and the only difference deals with the in - plane displacement of the vo@xmath11 octahedra ( plane implies the equatorial plane of octahedra , i.e. , the plane of the half - filled @xmath15 orbital ) .",
    "such displacement favors @xmath46 rather than @xmath47 , although one would not expect a considerable difference between the two integrals .",
    "however , our experimental and computational results suggest the scenario of @xmath86 resulting in a system of weakly coupled dimers rather than in an alternating chain .",
    "basically , the structural considerations suggest correct trends , but quantitative estimates require more sophisticated techniques .    in this paper",
    ", we tried to use an adequate computational approach to the study of vanadium phosphates .",
    "all the computational results available are based on very simplified techniques such as extended hckel @xcite or dft gga calculations @xcite for small clusters ( typically , spin dimers  two vo@xmath11 octahedra and bridging po@xmath3 tetrahedra ) .",
    "now , we show that vanadium phosphates are readily accessible to full - potential band structure calculations that are known as a very efficient tool for the study of magnetic properties of transition metal oxides.@xcite full - potential calculations provide reasonable accuracy and set the computational results on much safer grounds compared to cluster calculations , since the crude cluster approximation is avoided and correlation effects ( which are very important for the properties of transition metal compounds ) can be included .",
    "we are looking forward to the further application of full - potential calculations to vanadium phosphates and to the discovery of novel unusual spin systems in these compounds .",
    "it is worth noting that ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 may be an interesting realization of the alternating zigzag chain model .",
    "this model , also known as dimerized zigzag chain or dimerized frustrated chain , has been extensively studied theoretically with a particular interest to its excitation spectrum.@xcite however , the experimental access to the model is still scarce and basically limited by the spin peierls phase of cugeo@xmath18 that corresponds to the weakly dimerized case . as we have stated above ,",
    "ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 is strongly dimerized , and the dominating spin - gap properties are observed .",
    "nevertheless , the frustration of weak interdimer couplings may be manifested in high - field properties of the material or its magnetic excitations .    using the representative values of @xmath87",
    "k , @xmath88 k , we find @xmath89 , @xmath90 and estimate the position of ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 on the phase diagram of the model [ @xmath91 is the frustration ratio , while @xmath92 is the dimerization ratio ] . according to refs .   and , this position implies the presence of magnetization plateau , while ref .   suggests the formation of bound singlet and triplet states above the elementary triplet excitation that corresponds to the spin gap .",
    "thus , a detailed study of the high - field properties of ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 and neutron scattering experiments probing the magnetic excitations of this compound could be interesting .    in conclusion , we studied magnetic properties of ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 using magnetic susceptibility measurements and full - potential band structure calculations .",
    "we reach a perfect consistency between experimental and computational results and describe ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 as a system of weakly coupled dimers on the alternating zigzag chain , although the strong dimerization is rather surprising from the structural point of view .",
