    "a recent study of the dynamics of the outer regions of ngc  4406 ( m  86 ) using radial velocities of planetary nebulae ( pns ) by arnaboldi  ( 1996 ) produced the serendipitous discovery of 3 pns whose velocities were near the mean redshift of the virgo cluster ( around @xmath1 ) . since ngc  4406 has a peculiar redshift of about @xmath2 , this led to the conclusion that the 3 pns do not belong to ngc 4406 , but are members of an intergalactic or intracluster diffuse stellar population in the virgo cluster .",
    "more recently , other independent observations gave further evidence for intracluster stars : a deep hst image of a blank field near m 87 revealed several hundreds of red giants ( ferguson  1996 , 1997 ) , and theuns and warren ( 1997 ) reported the detection of several intracluster pn candidates in the fornax cluster .    the existence of a diffuse intracluster stellar population has been expected , as a consequence of the stripping of stars from galaxies in clusters through the effect of fast encounters with other galaxies and the interaction of the galaxies with the tidal field of the cluster itself .",
    "this process ( harassment ) was simulated recently by moore  ( 1996 ) .",
    "planetary nebulae are ideal tracers of such an intracluster stellar population .",
    "they are relatively easy to find and , from surveys of several fields in the virgo cluster , it is possible to map the surface density distribution of the intracluster population , compare it with the distribution of the galaxies in the cluster ( see binggeli  1987 ) , and estimate its total mass .",
    "in addition , the fact that the detected flux is concentrated in one spectral line ( [ o iii ] @xmath3 ) makes it relatively easy to measure the radial velocities of these intracluster pns with adequate accuracy . using the pn radial velocities",
    ", we can compare the kinematics of this intracluster population with the kinematics of the diffuse population produced in simulations of galaxy harassment .    as a by - product of the pn detections ,",
    "the luminosity function of the intracluster pns can be used to obtain a new estimate of the distance to the virgo cluster , less affected by problems of incompleteness of galactic pn samples and the back - to - front uncertainties related to the galaxy morphological types and their spatial segregation in the cluster ( e.g. jacoby   1990 ) . given a large enough sample of intracluster pns",
    "it will be interesting to compare them with the jacoby  ( 1990 ) pns , because the intracluster sample may have slightly brighter pns ; across the cluster depth we expect to detect preferentially those pns which are closer to us ( jacoby 1997 ) .",
    "to enlarge the statistics on the intracluster pn population in the virgo cluster core , we decided to survey an additional field in virgo , using the well - established [ o iii ] on - band / off - band technique of jacoby  ( 1990 ) .",
    "we selected a field near the core of the virgo cluster but well away from bright galaxies and bright stars , and made a deep search for intracluster pns . in this letter we present the discovery of 11 pn candidates ( sections  2 and 3 ) , and discuss of possible contaminations from starburst galaxies at high redshifts in section  4 .",
    "we discuss the cumulative pn luminosity function ( pnlf ) and the surface mass density of the diffuse population in sections  5 and 6 .",
    "conclusions are given in section  7 .",
    "the highest priority field for our survey was centered at ra(2000)@xmath4 , @xmath5 , in the core region , near the center of group a in the virgo cluster ( see the isopleths in fig .",
    "4 of binggeli  1987 ) , where there are no bright stars and no giant galaxies , in order to survey only the diffuse intracluster population . using the ned database we verified that there is no known dwarf or low surface brightness galaxy belonging to the virgo cluster within the selected field .",
    "the only previously known galaxy in the field is number 166 in drinkwater  ( 1996 ) , a background object at a redshift @xmath6 .",
    "we also verified that an extrapolation of the halos of nearby giant galaxies ( m 84 , m 86 , m 87 ) based on the r@xmath7 law , using data from peletier  ( 1990 ) and caon  ( 1990 ) , gives such a low blue surface brightness in our selected field ( fainter than 31 mag arcsec@xmath8 ) that no detection of pns belonging to those galaxies can be expected . for comparison , in section 6",
    "we derive a blue surface brightness of 28.3 mag arcsec@xmath8 for the detected stellar intracluster population .",
    "the observations were made with the prime focus ccd camera of the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( observatorio del roque de los muchachos , la palma , spain ) on the 5 - 8 of may , 1997 .",
    "we used a 2k @xmath9 2k loral ccd with 15 @xmath10 m pixels ( 0.26 arcsec pixel@xmath11 ) and @xmath12 quantum efficiency at 5000  .",
    "the on - band and off - band interference filters were provided by the instituto de astrofsica de canarias ( iac filters numbers 7 and 18 ) : their central wavelengths were 5028   and 5457  , maximum transmissions 87% and 77% , equivalent widths 45.2 and 147.7  , and fwhms 50 and 200    respectively . since the filters were located in the f/2.8 converging beam , and the operating temperature was about 12c , the central wavelengths were blueshifted to 5021   and 5450  , for the on- and off - band filter . for the mean redshift of the virgo cluster , and the velocity dispersion @xmath13 the width of the on - band filter covered all the velocities in the @xmath14 to @xmath15 range , centered at the mean redshift of the virgo cluster .",
    "the interference filters were smaller than the normal filters used at the wht prime focus camera , and the effective surveyed field was circular with a radius of 4 arcmin .",
    "we had sporadic cirrus clouds during the first two nights ; the third night was photometric .",
    "the typical seeing was 0.9 arcsec , and 1.1 arc sec at large airmasses .",
    "we were able to make @xmath16 s exposures through the on - band filter , with air masses less than 1.4 , and @xmath17 s exposures through the off - band filter ( frequently at higher air masses ) .",
    "we reached a fainter limiting magnitude in the off - band images .",
    "we also obtained on - band and off - band exposures of the standard star g138 - 31 ( oke 1990 ) for the flux calibrations , and several twilight flat fields with high number counts .",
    "the ccd reductions were made using standard tasks provided by iraf .",
    "after bias - level subtraction and flatfielding , the on - band images were registered and combined , to minimize the effect of bad columns ( the telescope was dithered between exposures ) and eliminate cosmic ray events . the image combination was made with the iraf task combine , using the average option and ccdclip rejection ( pixel rejection based on ccd noise parameters ) .",
    "the resulting combined on- and off - band images were split into subimages , and each of the 16 on - band subimages was carefully inspected for pn [ o iii ] emission by blinking it with the corresponding off - band subimage .",
    "a test image obtained by dividing the on - band image by the off - band image was also blinked with the off - band image . with these two blinking procedures ,",
    "several candidates were selected . for each candidate we inspected the individual images , to check whether the apparent emission was an artifact resulting from the bad ccd columns or from an uneliminated partial superposition of cosmic ray events (",
    "a few such cases were found ) .",
    "after careful examination , we identified 11 pn candidates which satisfied the following criteria :    \\(1 ) they were clearly visible ( detection above 2.5 sigma ) in the combined on - band image , but not visible ( below 1 sigma ) in the combined off - band image ,    \\(2 ) of similar brightness in all of the individual on - band images ,    \\(3 ) unresolved point - like sources .",
    "two additional unresolved sources were found : although they appear much brighter in the on - band image , they are also visible in the off - band image .",
    "we will discuss them below in more detail .",
    "arnaboldi  ( 1996 ) found 3 intergalactic pns in an area of 16 arcmin@xmath0 , which would imply the presence of 9 pns in our 50 arcmin@xmath0 field , if we assume a similar pn surface density and the same limiting magnitude .",
    "therefore we find good agreement between the detected candidates and the expected number of intracluster pns from the previous work .",
    "this agreement is relevant in particular because the 3 intergalactic pns of arnaboldi  are spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "the photometry was made with the phot and daophot routines in iraf , following standard procedures : aperture photometry for the standard star ( an aperture diameter of 14 pixels was adopted ) and psf - fitting for all point sources in the on - band and off - band combined images .",
    "the fwhm of the psf was 4 and 5 pixels for the combined on - band and off - band images , respectively ; the larger fwhm for the off - band image was expected because of the larger air masses .",
    "a set of 20 stars was used ( 1 ) to calculate an aperture correction of @xmath18 mag to the instrumental magnitudes , and ( 2 ) to correct the instrumental magnitudes from the first two ( non - photometric ) nights to the system of the images from the last ( photometric ) night .",
    "this correction was @xmath19 mag .",
    "we obtained the fluxes @xmath20 in erg cm@xmath8 s@xmath11 , using the measurements of the standard star g138 - 31 and the properties of the on - band filter .",
    "the @xmath20 flux can be expressed in magnitudes @xmath22 ,    @xmath23    ( jacoby 1989 ) .",
    "the @xmath22 of the 11 pn candidates are between 26.8 and 28.6 .",
    "we estimate errors of 0.05 mag for the brighter objects and 0.2 mag for the fainter ones .",
    "could our objects be unresolved emission - line galaxies whose emission lines have been redshifted into the on - band filter centered at 5021   ( e.g. [ o ii ] 3727 at @xmath24 , or lyman  @xmath25 at @xmath26 ) ?",
    "we can estimate how many high - redshift emission - line galaxies would lie within our field of 50 arcmin@xmath27 . from our photometry",
    ", an object must be fainter than 26th ( visual ) magnitude to be undetected in our off - band combined image .",
    "we can use the analysis of ellis  ( 1996 ) and heyl  ( 1997 ) on high redshift starburst galaxies as a starting point for our discussion .",
    "we assume that h@xmath28 = 70 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 and q@xmath28 = 0.5 .",
    "then , for redshifts between 0.340 and 0.354 , from eqs .",
    "( 6 ) , ( 7 ) , ( 8) of ellis , we find that the proposed starburst galaxies must be fainter than @xmath29 , and that the effective surveyed volume is 228 mpc@xmath30 . from figure 21 of heyl , we read a value of 0.022 galaxies mpc@xmath31 mag@xmath11 for the luminosity function of starburst galaxies . for our surveyed volume of 228 mpc@xmath30",
    "we derive a total number of 5 starburst galaxies per mag .",
    "even if these galaxies were to appear unresolved in the on - band image , their [ o ii ] 3727 emission would need to be very strong to satisfy our observational constraints . from our filter transmission curves , if these high redshift galaxies have a @xmath32 , and remain undetected in the off - band image , then their [ o ii ] 3727 equivalent width has to be 100  .",
    "figure 19 of heyl  indicates that the [ o ii ] equivalent widths of these high redshift galaxies do not usually reach this level .",
    "additional evidence comes from studies of emission - line galaxies detected by popescu  ( 1996 ) . from unpublished spectra",
    "it is possible to estimate that only about 5% of those emission - line galaxies can have an [ o ii ] equivalent width of 100  .",
    "we conclude that none of our pn candidates brighter than @xmath32 can be explained as starburst galaxies at @xmath24 , perhaps only a few of the fainter ones . from similar arguments",
    "( see also theuns and warren 1997 ) we can also exclude galaxies or quasars at higher redshifts as an explanation for the majority of our pn candidates .    some level of contamination remains possible in our sample , and we plan to acquire spectra of our pn candidates in the near future .",
    "it seems likely that the two point - like sources reported above , which were visible in the off - band image and brighter in the on - band , are starburst galaxies or quasars ; this also requires spectroscopic confirmation .",
    "in what follows we will assume that the 11 candidates are intergalactic pns in the virgo cluster .",
    "the sample is limited , so we can not build the pn luminosity function as in jacoby  ( 1990 ) .",
    "we prefer to use the cumulative pn luminosity function , which gives for each value of @xmath22 the total number of pns brighter than @xmath22 .",
    "the result is given in figure 1 , where the cumulative pnlf is compared with simulated pnlfs .",
    "the simulated pnlfs are calculated for three different sample sizes ( by sample size we mean the total number of pns in the surveyed area , of which only the brightest are detected ) .",
    "we use numerical pnlf simulations like those discussed by mndez and soffner ( 1997 ) .",
    "these pnlf simulations reproduce the observed pnlf of m 31 s bulge , a population without recent star formation , assumed to be sufficiently similar to the one in the outskirts of elliptical galaxies .    to transform the measured @xmath22 into absolute magnitudes , we adopt a distance modulus of 30.9 mag and an interstellar extinction correction of 0.06 mag ( jacoby   1990 , mndez  1993 ) .",
    "the simulated and observed cumulative pnlfs agree well , which supports the identification of our candidates as intracluster pns in the virgo cluster .",
    "we do not have enough objects for a reliable distance determination , but the good agreement between the observed and simulated pnlfs is a check of consistency with the adopted distance modulus .",
    "from our rough evaluation of the pnlf sample size in figure  1 , we estimate the surface mass density of the diffuse intergalactic population .",
    "if @xmath33 is the specific pn formation rate , in pn yr@xmath11 l@xmath34 ; @xmath35 is the total bolometric luminosity of the sampled population ; and @xmath36 is the lifetime of a pn ( which we take as 30,000 years ) , then the pnlf sample size @xmath37 is given by the following relation :    @xmath38    for a more detailed discussion on the practical use of this relation , see mndez  ( 1993 ) and soffner   ( 1996 ) .",
    "here we adopt @xmath39 , from figure  1 , and @xmath40 ( a typical value for virgo ellipticals , with an uncertainty of about 50% ; see jacoby 1990 and mndez  1993 ) .",
    "we derive a surveyed luminosity of @xmath41 . given the uncertainties in @xmath37 and @xmath33 , we estimate that our result for the surveyed luminosity is uncertain by a factor 2 or 3",
    ".    would this intracluster population be detectable through its emitted continuum light ?",
    "the luminosity derived above ( @xmath41 ) corresponds to a blue surface brightness of 28.3 mag arsec@xmath8 , which would be difficult to detect on the angular scale of the virgo cluster .",
    "we conclude that there is no inconsistency at this time between the diffuse surface brightness of the virgo cluster and the presence of an intracluster stellar population as seen through the pns .",
    "binggeli  ( 1987 ) estimate that the central surface luminosity density in the virgo cluster is 10@xmath42 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath43 in our surveyed area of 50 arcmin@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , assuming similar distributions , the luminosity contributed by the intracluster population could be of the order of 50% of the luminosity from all galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "this number is quite similar to that found by theuns and warren ( 1997 ) in the fornax cluster and by bernstein ( 1995 , from a study of the diffuse light ) in the coma cluster .",
    "assume now for the virgo intracluster stars a mass - to - luminosity ratio of 5 , typical for the stellar content of an old population ( we do not include here any dark matter possibly associated with such a population ) .",
    "then the total surveyed stellar mass is @xmath44 m@xmath45 .",
    "again , this could amount to about 50% of the stellar mass from all galaxies in the cluster . at a distance of 15 mpc our surveyed area corresponds to @xmath46 pc@xmath27 .",
    "therefore the surface mass density of stars is 4 m@xmath47 for the intracluster population at the surveyed position .",
    "let us compare the intracluster stellar surface mass density of 4 @xmath48 with the surface mass density of the total gravitational mass in the virgo cluster at the same position in the sky .",
    "a rough estimate of the latter can be obtained as follows .",
    "we take recent studies of the virgo cluster structure as derived from x - ray images ( bhringer  1994 ) and x - ray spectra ( nulsen and bhringer 1995 ) .",
    "we adopt the distribution of gravitating mass given by nulsen and bhringer ( see their eq . 13 and their fig .",
    "5 ) , extrapolate it out to a distance of 1 mpc from the center of m 87 ( which gives a total gravitating mass of 1.5@xmath49 solar masses ) , recover the mass density ( mass per unit volume ) at each point and integrate along the line of sight through the cluster at the position of our field . in this way we obtain a total gravitational surface mass density of 80 m@xmath47 . since the surface l density of the intracluster population is @xmath50 ,",
    "we conclude that the m / l ratio ( where m is the total gravitational mass ) at the position of our search is approximately 100 .",
    "nulsen and bhringer estimate that the total gravitational mass near the center of the cluster is roughly 15 times the mass of the hot gas .",
    "we obtain a similar factor ( 20 ) for the ratio between the total gravitational mass and the mass of the intracluster population .",
    "then , if we assume spherical symmetry and similar distributions as a function of distance to the center , the mass of the diffuse intracluster stellar population may be of the same order of magnitude as the mass of hot gas in the intracluster medium .",
    "all these estimates are of course extremely uncertain , and our main purpose in making them is to show that it would be interesting to repeat the search for pns at several different positions across the virgo cluster in order to map the surface mass density of the diffuse intracluster population . the contribution from this new population can not account for all the dark matter in the virgo cluster , but it certainly increases the ratio of visible to total matter , making it harder to reconcile the results of standard big bang nucleosynthesis with an @xmath51 universe , as discussed for example in white  ( 1993 ) .",
    "our search confirms our earlier discovery of an intracluster stellar population in the virgo cluster , and gives a further hint that this population may represent a significant contribution to the total mass of the cluster .",
    "the next steps in this program are : ( 1 ) survey further fields at different distances from the center of the cluster , to map the structure of this population ; ( 2 ) acquire spectra of the detected objects , to check their identification as pns and to start the kinematical study of this population ; ( 3 ) study numerical simulations of star stripping , scaled to the virgo cluster , to investigate the expected kinematics of the stripped stellar population and to evaluate the likely mass fraction of stripped stars in the cluster .",
    "the william herschel telescope is operated on the island of la palma by the isaac newton group in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias .",
    "the work reported here has been supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft through grant sfb ( sonderforschungsbereich ) 375 .",
    "rhm would like to acknowledge useful discussions with ralf bender and roberto saglia ."
