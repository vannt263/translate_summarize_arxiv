    "recent large galaxy redshift surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",

    "* hereafter msfr ) measured the mean surface matter density profile of the sdss main galaxies with the mean redshift @xmath5 through gravitational lensing magnification of background quasars ( qsos ) .",
    "they calculated the cross - correlation between the number density of foreground galaxies and the flux magnification of background qsos . the cross - correlation function",
    "was then converted to the surface matter density profile @xmath6 of the lens galaxies as a function of the projected distance @xmath7 from the galactic center .",
    "the derived profile is well approximated as @xmath8 at @xmath9 .",
    "msfr also detected the systematic offset between the five sdss photometric bands in magnification of background qsos ; in shorter wavelength , qsos appear less magnified .",
    "it is interpreted as reddening due to dust in and around foreground galaxies . adopting the small magellanic cloud type dust model for the sample galaxies , they derived the mean surface dust density profile of galaxies @xmath10 from the galaxy - qso color cross - correlation function .",
    "the shape of the derived @xmath11 is very similar to that of @xmath6 at @xmath9 , suggesting that there is a substantial amount of dust in the galactic halos ( see also chelouche et al .",
    "2007 ; mcgee & balogh 2010 ) .",
    "theoretical models are needed to properly interpret the observationally inferred dust distribution .    in this letter",
    ", we develop an analytic model based on the so - called halo approach to study the distribution of dust around galaxies .",
    "earlier in @xcite , we used cosmological @xmath12-body simulations to study in detail the matter distribution around galaxies .",
    "there , we showed that the observed surface density profile can be used to determine the characteristic mass of the sample lens galaxies , and that the mass distributed beyond the galaxies virial radii contributes about half of the global mass density .",
    "we provide a physical model for the dust distribution in this letter .",
    "our model is characterized by two key physical parameters ; one is the host halo mass of the galaxies and the other is the extent of dust distribution .",
    "the former is determined from the observed matter profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the latter can be inferred from the dust distribution .",
    "how far dust is transported from the galaxies is indeed a highly interesting question .",
    "the observed dust profile is well described by a single power law over a wide range of distance of from 10kpc to 10mpc .",
    "we show that the profile is decomposed into two parts , the so - called one - halo and two - halo terms .",
    "we parametrize the one - halo term such that dust is distributed to @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the galaxy s virial radius . through model",
    "fitting , we determine the extension parameter @xmath2 to be greater than unity .",
    "we discuss the implication for the dust production and transport mechanism into intergalactic space .",
    "we present a simple formulation to calculate the surface dust density profile .",
    "our model is based on the so - called halo approach @xcite . the mean surface density @xmath10 is divided into two terms : @xmath13 where @xmath7 is the distance in the projected two - dimensional plane .",
    "the one - halo term @xmath14 arises from the central halo , and the two - halo term @xmath15 from the neighbouring halos .",
    "the contribution from an individual galaxy halo with mass @xmath16 to the one - halo term @xmath14 is given by the projection of the halo dust density profile @xmath17 along the line - of - sight @xmath18 : @xmath19 the one - halo term is then a number - weighted average of @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the halo mass function and @xmath23 is the threshold halo mass for the sample galaxies .",
    "the threshold mass corresponds to the typical host halo mass of the observed galaxies .",
    "we calculate the two - halo term power spectrum @xmath24 as follows : @xmath25\\nonumber \\\\    & \\times&\\left[\\frac{1}{n_{\\rm halo}}\\int_{m_{\\rm min}}^\\infty { \\rm d}m_h\\frac{{\\rm d}n}{{\\rm d}m_h}b(m_h)u_d(k|m_h)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the mean cosmic dust density , @xmath27 is the linear matter power spectrum , @xmath28 is the halo bias factor , @xmath29 is dust mass in and around a halo with mass @xmath16 , and @xmath30 is the fourier transform of the density profile @xmath31 normalized by its dust mass . the power spectrum is converted to the two - point correlation function via @xmath32 then we obtain the two - halo term of the mean surface density profile @xmath33    we adopt a flat-@xmath34cdm cosmology , with @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "we use the code _ camb _ to obtain the linear matter powerspectrum @xcite and utilize the halo mass function and bias given by @xcite at @xmath36 which is equal to the mean redshift of the galaxy sample used in msfr .",
    "we assume that the spatial distribution of dust within and around a halo is organized as @xmath37 where @xmath1 is the virial radius . within the virial radius @xmath1 ,",
    "the mean internal matter density is @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is given by @xcite .",
    "essentially , we assume that the dust distribution follows a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) profile with exponential cut - off at @xmath40 .",
    "one of our aims in this letter is to determine the value of @xmath2 , i.e. , how far dust is distributed from galaxies .",
    "[ rho_dust ] shows the shape of the dust density profile @xmath41 for a halo with mass @xmath42 computed in the above manner .",
    "we see the dependence on @xmath2 clearly .",
    "the power - law shape is motivated by the fact that the observationally derived surface dust profile itself is well fit by a simple power law of @xmath43 , similarly to matter distribution ( msfr ) .",
    "also , detailed calculations of dust ejection and radiation - driven transport by @xcite show approximately a power - law distribution for the resulting gas metallicity through dust sputtering .     and 10 , respectively . for comparison",
    ", we also show the nfw @xcite and the untruncated sis profiles by grey lines .",
    "note that the amplitudes are arbitrary in this figure.,width=321 ]    we have also examined other profiles of the form @xmath44 and @xmath45 with a similar exponential cut - off .",
    "however , we have found that neither of the steeper or the shallower profile reproduces well the observed dust profile at small distances .",
    "we therefore adopt the profile equation ( [ eq : dust_1halo ] ) in our model .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 note that the value of @xmath48 should be unity in small-@xmath49 limit .",
    "we determine the amplitude of @xmath31 by setting the halo dust mass associated with a halo to be a certain value @xmath50 . to this end",
    ", we first consider the total amount of dust around galaxies in the local universe .",
    "@xcite estimated the total amount , in units of the cosmic density parameter , @xmath51 interestingly , this value is close to the difference between the estimated amount of dust produced and shed by stars over the age of the universe and the summed amount found in local galactic discs ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "suppose that the comoving density of the total halo dust remains constant in the local universe .",
    "then the mean cosmic density of dust in galactic halos is given by @xmath52 we set the dust mass associated with a halo to be @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the dust - halo mass ratio .",
    "we integrate the dust mass weighted by the halo mass function to obtain the global dust density .",
    "we normalize @xmath41 , or equivalently @xmath54 , by matching the global dust density to equation ( [ eq : globaldust2 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath54 is not necessarily a constant but can be a function of halo mass .",
    "an essential physical quantity in our model is the dust - halo mass ratio @xmath54 in equation ( [ amp ] ) .",
    "we propose two simple models .",
    "the first one is _ constant model _ , i.e. , @xmath54 is independent of halo mass .",
    "the dust - halo mass ratio is simply the global density ratio @xmath55    because the heavy elements that constitute dust are produced by stars , it may be reasonable to expect that the dust mass is proportional to the stellar mass .",
    "intriguingly , @xcite used data of akari and galex to show a moderate correlation between the stellar mass and dust attenuation indicator for the sample galaxies ( see their figure 16 ) . in our second model , we consider the observed galaxy stellar - halo mass relation to model the halo mass dependence of @xmath54 .",
    "we call the model as _ mass dependent model_. @xcite recently studied the stellar - halo mass relation from the joint analysis of galaxy - galaxy weak lensing , galaxy clustering and galaxy number densities using the cosmos survey data",
    ". we use their functional form with the best fit parameters at @xmath56 , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the galaxy stellar mass , @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we then relate the dust mass to the stellar mass as @xmath61 the normalization constant is determined to be @xmath62 by integrating this equation weighted by the halo mass function .",
    "the global dust mass density thus calculated is matched to equation ( [ eq : globaldust2 ] ) .",
    "[ gamma ] compares @xmath54 for our two models .",
    "for the constant and the mass dependent model , respectively.,width=321 ]    the shape of @xmath54 for the mass - dependent model reflects the stellar - halo mass relation .",
    "the peak value of @xmath54 at @xmath63 is @xmath64 .",
    "overall , @xmath54 for the mass dependent model is larger than that for the constant model at the characteristic mass of the sample galaxies ( see section 3 ) .",
    "we are now able to calculate the dust surface density profile . in fig .",
    "[ sigma_dust_alpha ] , we show the dependence of the surface dust density profile on the extension parameter @xmath2 .     and 10 . the projected radius is the physical distance at @xmath36 .",
    "the constant model for dust - halo mass ratio is adopted .",
    "the dotted and the dashed lines represent the one - halo and the two - halo terms , respectively .",
    "the solid lines show the sum of the two terms.,width=321 ]    for this figure , the threshold halo mass is fixed to be @xmath65 .",
    "we compare three cases ; @xmath66 and 10 .",
    "the dotted lines show the one - halo term .",
    "clearly the extension parameter @xmath2 affects significantly the amplitude and the shape of the one - halo term .",
    "the central surface density is larger for smaller @xmath2 .",
    "this can be easily understood by noting the total dust mass associated with a halo is given by equation ( [ amp ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath2 does not affect much the two - halo term at @xmath67 .",
    "the amplitude of the two - halo term is essentially set by the halo bias @xmath68 ( see equation [ 5 ] ) .",
    "we fit our dust distribution model to the observed surface dust density through least chi - squared minimization .",
    "we have two physical parameters , @xmath23 and @xmath2 , in our model .",
    "we have found that poor constraints are obtained on the parameters when both of them are treated as free parameters . because @xmath23 is already estimated to be @xmath65 in @xcite through detailed comparison of the observed matter distribution with the results of @xmath12-body simulations , it is sensible to fit our dust distribution model by treating only @xmath2 as a free parameter .",
    "namely , the characteristic halo mass can be determined by the gravitational lensing measurement of the matter distribution , whereas the dust distribution extension can be inferred from the observed dust profile .",
    "we evaluate the likelihood of the specific model by the @xmath69 value of the model fit to the observed quantities .",
    "the obtained best - fit @xmath2 for the constant and the mass dependent models are , respectively , @xmath70 fig .",
    "[ sig_dust ] shows the best - fit dust profile of the constant model with @xmath71 and that of the mass dependent model with @xmath72 .    .",
    "the results from our constant model and mass dependent model are shown by the green and the black lines , respectively .",
    "the dotted , the dashed and the solid lines are the one - halo , the two - halo and the total , respectively . , width=321 ]    the data points are from msfr . both models for @xmath54 reproduce the observed profile fairly well .",
    "it is interesting to compare these two equally good models .",
    "the mass dependent model requires a larger @xmath2 , which is owing to the difference in the typical value of @xmath54 for the two models . at @xmath73 , @xmath54 of mass dependent model is higher than that of constant model .",
    "because the one - halo term is largely contributed by halos with masses @xmath74 , the best fit @xmath2 is larger for the mass dependent model to match the observed inner dust surface density profile ( see fig.[sigma_dust_alpha ] ) .",
    "overall , our simple models reproduce the observed dust profile very well . intriguingly ,",
    "both our models suggest @xmath75 , i.e. , halo dust is distributed over a few hundred kilo parsecs from the galaxies .",
    "it is also important that the observed power law surface density @xmath76 at @xmath77 can be explained with @xmath75 .",
    "the apparent large - scale dust distribution is explained by the two - halo contributions .",
    "dust is distributed to / over @xmath78 from a galaxy , but not necessarily up to 10 mpc as one might naively expect from the observed dust profile .",
    "it is worth discussing the total dust budget in the universe .",
    "the amplitude of the two - halo term depends largely on the mean cosmic density of intergalactic dust , @xmath79 in equation ( [ eq : twohalo ] ) .",
    "is also a critical factor .",
    "however , the characteristic halo mass , and hence @xmath68 , is well constrained from the observed matter density profile , as shown in @xcite ] the excellent agreement at large separation between the observed dust density profile and our model prediction shown in fig .",
    "[ sig_dust ] implies that @xmath80 should be @xmath81 .",
    "clearly , a significant amount of dust exists around the galaxies .",
    "such `` halo dust '' can close the cosmic dust budget as discussed more quantitatively by @xcite .",
    "the intergalactic dust could cause non - negligible extinction and thus could compromise cosmological studies with distant supernovae @xcite .",
    "we calculate the mean extinction by the intergalactic dust following @xcite ( see their equation [ 2 ] ) . with our model mean cosmic density of @xmath82 , the predicted mean extinction is @xmath83 to @xmath84 .",
    "such an opacity is not completely negligible even in the current sne surveys , and will become important for future surveys that are aimed at determining cosmological parameters with sub - percent precision @xcite .",
    "we have shown that our halo model can reproduce the dust profile around galaxies measured by msfr . by fitting the model to the observed dust profile ,",
    "we infer that dust is distributed beyond the virial radius of a galaxy .",
    "several authors proposed radiation - driven transport of dust from galactic discs into intergalactic medium at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that galactic winds can disperse dust into the inter - galactic medium efficiently .",
    "such studies generally suggest that dust can travel up to a few @xmath85 100 kpc from galaxies if the ejection velocity is @xmath86 . the relatively larger extent radius of dust for our mass dependent model requires very efficient transport mechanisms .",
    "note also that the dust must survive on its way through the galactic halos .",
    "dust in a large , group - size halo could be destroyed by thermal sputtering in hot gas ( bianchi & ferrara 2005 ; mcgee & balogh 2010 ) . clearly",
    ", detailed theoretical studies on dust transport are needed .",
    "fluctuations of the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) provide insight into dust distribution around galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite used blast data to measure the cib power spectrum . using a halo approach",
    ", they found that the observed power spectrum at small angular scales is reproduced if halo dust extends up to a few times of the virial radius of galactic halos .",
    "it is remarkably consistent with our conclusion in this letter .",
    "@xcite compared their measurements of the cib anisotropies from herschel wide - area surveys with @xcite .",
    "two power spectra are consistent with each other at small scales .",
    "our dust distribution model may provide a key element for studies on the cib .",
    "although our model reproduces the observed dust profiles very well , a few improvements can be certainly made .",
    "the dust extension @xmath2 and the dust - halo mass ratio @xmath54 are likely to depend on the halo mass and galaxy type etc ( mcgee & balogh 2010 ) .",
    "one may need to consider the distribution of satellite galaxies within a halo by using , for example , the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) .",
    "indeed , we see slight discrepancies between the model predictions and the observation in the dust profiles at @xmath87mpc ( fig .",
