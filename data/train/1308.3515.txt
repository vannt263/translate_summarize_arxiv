    "astrophysical searches for dark matter ( dm ) are a fundamental part of the experimental efforts to explore the dark sector .",
    "the strategy is to search for dm annihilation products in preferred regions of the sky , i.e. , those with the highest expected dm concentrations and still close enough to yield high dm - induced fluxes at the earth .",
    "for that reason , the galactic center ( gc ) , nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( dsphs ) satellites of the milky way , as well as local galaxy clusters are thought to be among the most promising objects for dm searches . in particular , dsphs represent very attractive targets because they are highly dm - dominated systems and are expected to be free from any other astrophysical gamma - ray emitters that might contaminate any potential dm signal .",
    "although the expected signal can not be as large as that from the gc , dsphs may produce a larger signal - to - noise ( @xmath4 ) ratio .",
    "this fact allows us to place very competitive upper limits on the gamma - ray signal from dm annihilation @xcite , using data collected by the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard the fermi gamma - ray observatory @xcite .",
    "these are often referred to as the most stringent limits on dm annihilation cross - section obtained so far .    despite these interesting limits derived from dsphs , the gc is still expected to be the brightest source of dm annihilations in the gamma - ray sky by several orders of magnitude .",
    "although several astrophysical processes at work in the crowded gc region make it extremely difficult to disentangle the dm signal from conventional emissions , the dm - induced gamma - ray emission is expected to be so large there that the search is still worthwhile .",
    "furthermore , the dm density in the gc may be larger than what is typically obtained in @xmath5-body cosmological simulations . ordinary matter ( baryons ) dominates the central region of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "thus , baryons may significantly affect the dm distribution .",
    "as baryons collapse and move to the center they increase the gravitational potential , which in turn forces the dm to contract and increase its density .",
    "this is a known and qualitatively well understood physical process @xcite .",
    "it is also observed in many cosmological simulations that include hydrodynamics and star formation @xcite . if this is the only effect of baryons , then the expected annihilation signal will substantially increase @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we analyze in detail the constraints that can be obtained for generic dm candidates from _",
    "fermi_-lat inner galaxy gamma - ray measurements assuming some specific ( and well motivated ) dm distributions .",
    "the approach is conservative , requiring simply that the expected dm signal does not exceed the gamma - ray emission observed by the _ fermi_-lat in an optimized region around the gc .",
    "the region is chosen in such a way that the @xmath4 ratio is maximized .",
    "this kind of analysis , without modeling of the astrophysical background , was also carried out by the _",
    "fermi_-lat collaboration to constrain dm models from galactic halo observations @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ profiles ]",
    "we discuss dm density profiles such as navarro , frenk and white ( nfw ) @xcite , einasto @xcite and burkert @xcite , paying special attention to the effect of baryonic compression .",
    "in section [ flux ] we model the gamma - ray flux from dm annihilation , taking into account the contributions from prompt photons and photons induced via inverse compton scattering ( ics ) .",
    "the latter is specially relevant for the @xmath3 channel .",
    "we will see that compressed profiles significantly increase the gamma - ray flux in the inner regions of the galaxy . in section [ data ]",
    "we analyze the gamma - ray flux from _ fermi_-lat measurements . for that we use an optimized region around the gc , which will depend on the particular dm density profile considered . taking into account these results , in section",
    "[ limits ] we are able to obtain significant limits on the annihilation cross - section for a generic dm candidate annihilating to @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 or @xmath2 , in the case that the collapse of baryons to the gc is accompanied by the contraction of the dm . in general , the upper limits on the annihilation cross section of dm particles are two orders of magnitude stronger than without contraction , where the thermal cross section is not excluded .",
    "finally , the conclusions are left for section [ conclusions ] .",
    "cosmological @xmath5-body simulations provide important results regarding the expected dm density in the central region of our galaxy .",
    "simulations suggest the existence of a universal dm density profile , valid for all masses and cosmological epochs .",
    "it is convenient to use the following parametrization for the dm halo density @xcite , which covers different approximations for dm density : @xmath6^ { \\frac{\\beta - \\gamma}{\\alpha}}}\\ ,   \\label{eq : kravtsov}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent a characteristic density and a scale radius , respectively . the nfw density profile @xcite , with ( @xmath9,@xmath10,@xmath11 ) = ( 1,3,1 ) ,",
    "is by far the most widely used in the literature .",
    "another approximation is the so - called einasto profile @xcite @xmath12 \\right\\}\\ , \\label{eq : einasto}\\ ] ] which provides a better fit than nfw to numerical results @xcite .",
    "finally , we will also consider dm density profiles that possess a core at the center , such as the purely phenomenologically motivated burkert profile @xcite :    @xmath13    early results on the central slopes of the dm profiles showed some significant disagreement between the estimates , with values ranging from @xmath14 @xcite to @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "as the accuracy of the simulations improved , the disagreement became smaller .",
    "for the via lactea ii ( vlii ) simulation the slope in ref .",
    "@xcite was estimated to be @xmath16",
    ". a re - analysis of the vlii simulation and new simulations performed by the same group give the slope @xmath17 @xcite , which is consistent with the aquarius simulation @xcite .",
    "another improvement comes from the fact that the simulations now resolve the cusp down to a radius of @xmath18  pc , which means that less extrapolation is required for the density of the central region .    yet",
    ", there is an additional ingredient that is expected to play a prominent role in the centers of dm halos : baryons .",
    "although only a very small fraction of the total matter content in the universe is due to baryons , they represent the dominant component at the very centers of galaxies like the milky way .",
    "actually , the fact that current n - body simulations do not resolve the innermost regions of the halos is a minor consideration relative to the uncertainties due to the interplay between baryons and dm .",
    "the baryons lose energy through radiative processes and fall into the central regions of a forming galaxy . as a consequence of this redistribution of mass , the resulting gravitational potential is deeper , and the dm must move closer to the center , increasing its density .",
    "this _ compression _ of dm halos due to baryonic infall was first studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for a spherically symmetric dm halo using simple simulations and adiabatic invariants .",
    "a convenient analytical approximation was provided in ref .",
    "the model was later modified @xcite to account for the eccentricity of orbits of dm particles .",
    "the effect seems to be confirmed by recent hydrodynamic simulations ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite . ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , for instance , the authors ran a set of high - resolution hydrodynamic simulations that self - consistently included complex baryonic physics such as gas dissipation , star formation and supernova feedback .",
    "they all showed a clear steepening of the inner dm density profiles with respect to dm - only simulations .",
    "indeed , it is argued by the authors that such effect should be always included in order to correctly model the mass distribution in galaxies and galaxy clusters .    as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effect of the baryonic adiabatic compression might be crucial for indirect dm searches , as it increases by several orders of magnitude the gamma - ray flux from dm annihilation in the inner regions , and therefore the dm detectability . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this effect was used to study the detection of supersymmetric dm by the _",
    "fermi_-lat , with the conclusion that fluxes from the gc would be largely reachable in significant regions of the supersymmetric parameter space .",
    "the effect of compression on galaxy clusters was recently studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there is however another possible effect related to baryons that tends to decrease the dm density and flatten the dm cusp @xcite .",
    "the mechanism relies on numerous episodes of baryon infall followed by a strong burst of star formation , which expels the baryons . at the beginning of each episode",
    "the baryons dominate the gravitational potential .",
    "the dm contracts to respond to the changed potential . a sudden onset of star formation drives the baryons out .",
    "the dm also moves out because of the shallower potential .",
    "each episode produces a relatively small effect on the dm , but a large number of them results in a significant decline of the dm density .",
    "indeed , cosmological simulations that implement this process show a strong decline of the dm density @xcite . whether the process happens in reality is still unclear",
    ". simulations with the cycles of infall - burst - expansion process require that the gas during the burst stage does not lose energy through radiation , which is not realistic .",
    "still , the strong energy release needed by the mechanism may be provided by other processes and the flattening of the dm cusp may occur .",
    "if this happened to our galaxy , then the dm density within the central @xmath19  pc may become constant @xcite .",
    "this would reduce the annihilation signal by orders of magnitude .",
    "we note that this mechanism would wipe out the dm cusp also in centers of dwarf galaxies @xcite . yet , a recent work that also includes stellar feedback offers a much more complicated picture in which galaxies may retain or not their dm cusps depending on the ratio between their stellar - to - halo masses @xcite .

    "however , in order to quantify the uncertainty in the dm density profile , we will use three well - motivated models : einasto , nfw and a compressed nfw ( nfw@xmath31 ) , whose parameters have been constrained from observational data of the milky way , as well as a cored burkert profile , also compatible with current constraints .",
    "we have followed ref .",
    "@xcite to choose the parameters of both the nfw and the nfw@xmath31 .",
    "we have fitted the resulting data of that work with the power - law parametrization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kravtsov ] ) .",
    "the results for both profiles are listed in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "the effect of baryonic adiabatic compression is clearly noticed at small @xmath37 as a steep power law @xmath38 with @xmath39 for nfw@xmath31 , which is in contrast to the standard nfw value , @xmath40 .",
    "we note that a value of @xmath39 is indeed perfectly consistent with what has been found in recent hydrodynamic simulations @xcite and it is also compatible with current observational constraints ( mainly derived from microlensing and dynamics ) on the slope of the dm density profile in the central regions of the milky way @xcite .",
    "these studies actually allow for even steeper adiabatically contracted profiles . concerning the einasto profile we will use the parameters provided in ref .",
    "@xcite . finally , for the burkert profile , we decided to choose a core radius of 2 kpc .",
    "this core size is in line with previous works @xcite and with that suggested by recent hydrodynamic simulations of milky way size halos @xcite . for the normalization of the profile we chose the value of the local density suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite for milky way burkert - like profiles .",
    "the resulting profile is also compatible with current observational constraints @xcite .",
    "note , however , that a recent work favors a substantially larger core radius and a slightly higher normalization for burkert - like profiles @xcite .",
    "all the profile parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : table1 ] and the four profiles are shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : j ] .    let us finally point out that there are other possible effects driven by baryons that might steepen the dm density profiles in the centers of dm halos , such as central black holes ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) , that we will not consider here .",
    "the gamma - ray flux from dm annihilation in the galactic halo has two main contributions @xcite : prompt photons and photons induced via ics .",
    "the former are produced indirectly through hadronization , fragmentation and decays of the dm annihilation products or by internal bremsstrahlung , or directly through one - loop processes ( but these are typically suppressed in most dm models ) .",
    "the second contribution originates from electrons and positrons produced in dm annihilations , via ics off the ambient photon background .",
    "the other two possible contributions to the gamma - ray flux from dm annihilation can be neglected in our analysis : radiation from bremsstrahlung is expected to be sub - dominant with respect to ics in the energy range considered ( @xmath27 - @xmath41 gev ) and a few degrees off the galactic plane ( see fig . 14 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and synchrotron radiation is only relevant at radio frequencies , below the _ fermi_-lat threshold .",
    "thus the gamma - ray differential flux from dm annihilation from a given observational region @xmath42 in the galactic halo can be written as follows : @xmath43 we discuss in detail both components in the next subsections .",
    "a continuous spectrum of gamma rays is produced mainly by the decays of @xmath44 s generated in the cascading of annihilation products and also by internal bremsstrahlung .",
    "while the former process is completely determined for each given final state of annihilation ( we will study @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 channels ) , the latter depends in general on the details of the dm model such as the dm particle spin and the properties of the mediating particle .",
    "nevertheless , it is known that internal bremsstrahlung always includes much model - independent final state radiation ( fsr ) , which is emitted directly from charged particles in the external legs @xcite . in our analysis of generic dm models",
    ", we only consider these fsr components of the internal bremsstrahlung .",
    "it is a safe choice for the conservative approach that we follow , since the inclusion of model - dependent emission from virtual charged mediators would make constraints only stronger @xcite .",
    "as we will consider throughout this work the case of self - conjugated dm particles , the prompt contribution can be written as @xmath45 this equation has to be multiplied by an additional factor of @xmath46 if the dm particle studied is not its own anti - particle .",
    "the discrete sum is over all dm annihilation channels .",
    "@xmath47 is the differential gamma - ray yield , @xmath48 is the annihilation cross - section averaged over the velocity distribution of the dm particles , @xmath49 is the mass of the dm particle , and the quantity @xmath50 ( commonly known as the _ j - factor _ ) is defined as @xmath51 the j - factor accounts for both the dm distribution and the geometry of the system for more details . ] .",
    "the integral of the square of the dm density @xmath52 in the direction of observation @xmath53 is along the line of sight ( _ l.o.s _ ) , and @xmath37 and @xmath54 represent the galactocentric distance and the distance to the earth , respectively . indeed , in eq .",
    "( [ gammaflux ] ) , all the dependence on astrophysical parameters is encoded in the j - factor itself , whereas the rest of the terms encode the particle physics input .",
    "the most crucial aspect in the calculation of @xmath55 is related to the modeling of the dm distribution in the gc .    in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : j ] , the @xmath55 quantity corresponding to each of the four profiles discussed in section [ profiles ] is shown as a function of the angle @xmath53 from the gc .",
    "the associated observational regions @xmath42 to each @xmath53 are taken around the gc .",
    "the angular integration is over a ring with inner radius of @xmath56 and external radius of @xmath53 .",
    "we have assumed a @xmath57 pc constant density core for both nfw and nfw@xmath31 , although as discussed e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite the results are almost insensitive to any core size below @xmath581 pc ( or even larger given the _",
    "fermi_-lat psf ) .",
    "remarkably , the adiabatic compression increases the dm annihilation flux by several orders of magnitude in the inner regions , i.e. , the regions of interest in the present study .",
    "this effect will turn out to be especially relevant when deriving limits on the dm annihilation cross section .",
    "we also note that for the burkert profile the value of @xmath55 is larger than for the nfw and einasto profiles .",
    "this is so because of the relative high normalization used for this profile compared to the others and , especially , due to the annular region around the gc where we are focusing our studies , which excludes the gc itself ( where such cored profiles would certainly give much less annihilation flux compared to cuspy profiles , see left panel of figure  [ fig : j ] ) .",
    "we note , however , that the use of another burkert - like profile with a larger dm core than the one used here , as e.g. , the one recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , may lead to substantially lower @xmath55 values , and thus to weaker dm constraints .",
    "in particular , we checked for the profile in ref .",
    "@xcite that the values of @xmath55 in the region shown in figure  [ fig : j ] are always smaller than about @xmath59 gev@xmath60 @xmath61 sr .",
    "notice finally that the nfw@xmath31 profile reaches a constant value of @xmath55 for a value of @xmath53 smaller than the other profiles .",
    "this is relevant for our discussion below for optimization of the region of interest for dm searches , since we see that for nfw@xmath31 a larger region of analysis will not increase the dm flux significantly as for nfw , einasto and burkert profiles .",

    "for these three parameters @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the so called diffusion coefficient , we have adopted three sets referred to as min , med and max models @xcite , which account for the degeneracy given by the local observations of the cosmic rays at the earth including the boron to carbon ratio , b / c @xcite . we take them as our benchmark points , although we note that min and max models do not imply minimal or maximal expected gamma - ray signal , respectively . to solve this equation under the described conditions ,",
    "we have used boxlib @xcite which is a general purpose partial differential equation solver with an adaptive mesh refinement method .",
    "we show in section [ limits ] that the use of the different diffusion models , min , med , max , does not introduce a large variation in the dm constraints .",
    "let us finally remark about the importance of the energy loss function @xmath87 .",
    "the two main energy loss mechanisms of @xmath73 in the galaxy are the ics and synchrotron radiation produced by interaction with the galactic magnetic field .",
    "the former is the only contribution to the energy losses that is usually considered , since it is the most important one in studies of sources far from the gc .",
    "but when the @xmath73 energy reaches several hundreds of gev , synchrotron radiation can dominate the energy loss rate due to the suppression factor in the ics contribution in the klein - nishina regime .",
    "by contrast , synchrotron radiation losses do not have this suppression , and are driven by the magnetic field energy density @xmath88 .",
    "although the strength and exact shape of the galactic magnetic field is not well known , in the literature it is broadly described by the from @xcite , @xmath89 normalized with the strength of the magnetic field around the solar system , @xmath90 , which is known to be in the range of 1 to @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "this field grows towards the gc and therefore one should expect that the energy losses are dominated by synchrotron radiation in the inner part of the galaxy @xcite . on the other hand , we can expect that when the magnetic field is stronger , the energy of the injected @xmath73 is more efficiently liberated in the form of synchrotron emission resulting in a softer spectrum , and producing therefore smaller constraints on the dm annihilation cross - section .",
    "we will check this in section [ limits ] .",
    "there we will also check that the ics effect becomes relevant only for the @xmath3 annihilation channel , since the contribution of the prompt gamma rays is less important than in other channels with hadronic decays .",

    "an important step in our analysis is the optimization of the roi using a data - driven procedure that maximizes the @xmath4 ratio . in order to do so ,",

    "is introduced to cover the gc , the galactic plane , and the high galactic latitude regions , where the statistical fluctuations of the galactic foreground dominate over the expected dm signal .",
    "the optimization procedure consists of finding the set of angles that mask a region such that the @xmath4 ratio is the largest for each dm profile considered .",
    "what we technically do is to minimize the inverse of the following quantity @xmath116 with @xmath109 running over unmasked pixels , varying masks .",
    "we use the numerical routine fmin of the python module scipy.optimize , which minimizes a function using the downhill simplex algorithm .",
    "we end up with four masks characterized by those angles given in table [ tab : table2 ] . in the same table",
    ", we also show the values of @xmath42 and @xmath55 for each profile . as expected , @xmath117 for all the profiles , since the broadest emission in the galactic plane is the one in the gc .",

    "clearly , the nfw@xmath31 roi is the smallest one .",
    "this can be easily understood by inspecting the right panel of figure  [ fig : j ] : the @xmath55 quantity for nfw@xmath31 becomes almost constant beyond only @xmath118 , whereas for the other profiles this quantity becomes flat at much larger radii .",
    "therefore , in the case of the nfw@xmath31 profile , increasing the angular aperture by a few more degrees does not increase the @xmath4 .",
    "note that the usual quantities to calculate @xmath4 ratios are observed counts and expected dm - induced counts but in this work , instead , we use observed gamma - ray flux ( rather than counts ) and j - factors ( formally proportional to the expected dm - induced gamma - ray flux ) .",
    "nevertheless , we checked that the use of observed fluxes and predicted j - factors turns out to be a very good approximation , which leads to similar optimized rois .",
    "we performed the following test . using the gtobssim tool and assuming the nfw profile , we simulated the events that different dm models could produce in the lat after 46 months of observation .",
    "we used the same irfs , cuts and procedure to select events as those used for the real observations . instead of using a fixed @xmath119 gev energy range we further optimize this quantity choosing an energy range centered around the dm emission peak .",

    "nevertheless , the situation is drastically different when we consider the dm compression due to baryonic infall in the inner region of the galaxy .",
    "indeed , by adopting the nfw@xmath31 profile and for a @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 channel , the thermal annihilation cross - section is already reached for a dm mass of 680 , 530 and 490 gev , respectively . for the @xmath3 channel",
    "the effect of the prompt gamma rays is less important since generally fewer photons are produced in the fsr compared to the hadronic decays of the other channels .",
    "( for the @xmath2 which is open when @xmath155 gev , the @xmath156 decays produce a large number of photons , especially at high energy ) .",
    "notice that the lower bound associated with prompt gamma rays for @xmath3 is 100 gev compared to about 500700 gev in the other channels .",
    "thus the ics is important in this case , also due to the relatively harder @xmath73 spectrum @xcite .",
    "we can see that for @xmath153 g the lower bound on the dm mass turns out to be 358 gev and for @xmath154 g the bound is 157 gev , using the min diffusion model . for med and max diffusion models",
    "the values turn out to be 404 , 171 gev and 439 , 179 gev , respectively . as discussed in subsection",
    "[ ics ] , when the magnetic field is stronger the energy of the injected @xmath73 is more efficiently liberated in the form of microwaves , resulting in a softer gamma - ray spectrum , and producing therefore lower constraints . therefore , we have shown that in those cases in which the ics component is dominant ( for heavy wimp masses in general ) , the variation of the magnetic field can significantly alter the expected gamma - ray fluxes from the inner regions of the galaxy .",
    "although the above results can be interpreted in general as implying that vanilla wimp models and contracted dm profiles are incompatible with the fermi data , one should keep in mind that if one works in the framework of a specific particle physics model this conclusion might in principle be avoided in some regions of the parameter space .",
    "for example , the final state can be a combination of the annihilation channels presented here , as in supersymmetry where the lightest neutralino annihilation modes are @xmath157 for a bino dm , and @xmath158 for a wino dm ( or for a higgs - portal model ) .",
    "more importantly , the value of the annihilation cross section in the galactic halo might be smaller than @xmath159 @xmath148 s@xmath141 for a dm candidate that is thermally produced .",
    "for example , in the early universe coannihilation channels can also contribute to @xmath160 .",
    "also , dm particles whose annihilation in the early universe is dominated by p - wave ( velocity - dependent ) contributions would have a smaller value of @xmath160 in the galactic halo , where the dm velocity is much smaller than at the time of freeze - out , and can therefore escape the constraints derived in this work .",
    "these two effects can in fact occur in some regions of the parameter space of well motivated models for particle dm , such as the neutralino . in this sense",
    ", the results derived above for pure annihilation channels can be interpreted as limiting cases that give an idea of what can happen in realistic scenarios .",
    "let us remark that the upper limits on the annihilation cross - section that we have obtained for the cases of nfw , einasto and burkert profiles are comparable to the ones previously reported by the _",
    "fermi_-lat collaboration @xcite , after a similar analysis of the galactic halo without modeling of the astrophysical background ( similar results were also obtained in ref .",
    "modeling of the background was also considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the results are competitive with those from dsphs @xcite , where the upper limit of the annihilation cross section is below the thermal one for dm masses smaller than 27 and 37 gev assuming a @xmath0 and a @xmath1 channel , respectively .",
    "remarkably , when we take into account the baryonic infall in our conservative analysis , forcing the dm to contract in those inner regions of the galaxy , we obtain much stronger limits .",
    "in particular , as discussed above , using our compressed dm density profile , nfw@xmath31 , the thermal cross section is excluded for a dm mass smaller than 680 and 530 gev in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 channel , respectively , thus improving those limits obtained from dsphs @xcite , and also those obtained from galaxy clusters @xcite . in the latter , dm masses smaller than about 100 gev",
    "are constrained provided that dm subhalos significantly contribute to boost the dm signal .",
    "in general , the upper limits on the dm annihilation cross section are two orders of magnitude stronger than without contraction . in recent works on the gc",
    "a similar analysis was carried out but subtracting the emission from known point sources and from the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "we derived constraints on the parameter space of generic dm candidates using _ fermi_-lat inner galaxy measurements .",
    "we considered well motivated dm density profiles , such as burkert , einasto and nfw , which are perfectly compatible with current observational data of the milky way .",
    "we then selected optimal regions around the gc , such that the @xmath4 ratio is maximized .",
    "when the effect of contraction in the dm halo due to baryons is included in the computation @xcite , the constraints turn out to be very strong . in particular",
    ", a compressed dm density profile allows us to place upper limits on the dm annihilation cross section that exclude the thermal cross section for a broad range of dm masses , as shown in figure  [ fig : const_b ] .",
    "this is the case for masses smaller than 680 , 530 and 490 gev for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels , respectively . for the @xmath3 channel , where the ics effect is important",
    ", the exclusion of the thermal cross - section is for a mass smaller than about 150 to 400 gev , depending on models of the galactic magnetic field .",
    "alternatively , one may interpret these results as implying that vanilla wimp models and contracted dm profiles are incompatible with the _ fermi _ data .",
    "although the constraints are very strong , the analysis is conservative since we require that the expected dm signal does not exceed the gamma - ray emission observed by the _",
