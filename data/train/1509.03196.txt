    "the significant issue of control arises naturally , but this remains to be outstanding and extremely challenging , since nonlinear dynamical processes generally take place on complex networks .",
    "control of nonlinear dynamics , especially when chaos is present , can be done but only for low - dimensional systems  @xcite . despite the development of nonlinear control methods  @xcite in certain particular situations such as consensus  @xcite , communication  @xcite",
    ", traffic  @xcite and device networks  @xcite , a general framework of controlling complex nonlinear - dynamical networks has yet to be developed .",
    "a natural approach is to reduce the problem to controlling complex networks with linear dynamics based on traditional frameworks from control engineering  @xcite .    in the past a few years , great progress was made toward understanding the linear controllability of complex networks in terms of the fundamental issue of the minimum number of driver nodes required to steer the whole network system from an arbitrarily initial state to an arbitrarily final state in finite time  @xcite .",
    "in particular , liu et al . successfully adopted the classic structural controllability theory developed by lin  @xcite to complex networks of various topologies  @xcite , for which the traditional kalman s rank condition  @xcite is difficult to be applied  @xcite .",
    "the ground breaking results show that , the structural controllability of a directed network can be assessed by using the maximum matching  @xcite algorithm .",
    "the effects of the density of in / out degree nodes were incorporated into the structural controllability framework  @xcite , which has also been applied to protein interaction networks  @xcite .",
    "recently , based on the classic popov - belevitch - hautus ( pbh ) rank condition  @xcite in traditional control engineering , a variant of the structural - controllability theory , the so - called exact controllability framework , was developed  @xcite .    for both the structural- and exact - controllability frameworks ,",
    "the aim is to determine the minimum number of driver nodes , @xmath0 , for networks of various topologies .",
    "however , we have encountered unexpected difficulties in carrying out _ actual _ control of complex networks by using the minimum set of driver nodes as determined by the controllability frameworks .",
    "this concerns effectively the issue of guiding the network system to approach a final state with acceptable proximity error . in particular , given an arbitrary complex network , once @xmath0 is determined",
    ", we can calculate the specific control signals by using the standard linear systems theory  @xcite and apply them at various unmatched nodes .",
    "a surprising finding is that , quite often , the actual control of the system is difficult to be achieved computationally in the sense that in any finite time , it is not possible to drive the system from an arbitrary initial state to an arbitrary final state , i.e. , the actual state the system finally reaches is unreasonably far from the designated one .",
    "this difficulty in realizing actual control , which has not been formerly addressed in any other works , persists for a large number of model and real - world networks , prompting us to study if the developed controllability frameworks can ensure actual control with given finite computational precision and , more importantly , to consider the issue of control energy .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the issue of control energy in the framework of structural controllability theory .",
    "we find that , the energy required to steer a system from a specific initial state to a target state in finite time follows a fat - tail distribution , indicating the existence of extraordinarily high energy requirement . in extreme but not uncommon cases ,",
    "the energy is practically divergent .",
    "this phenomenon signifies the emergence of a _ paradox _ in controlling complex networks : although a small fraction of driver nodes can guarantee full control of the network system mathematically , the energy required to achieve control is often unbearable .",
    "we resolve the paradox by presenting the idea of control chains , in which the fat - tail distribution of the energy can be derived as a key structural feature .",
    "the theory of control chains enables us to offer simple strategies to significantly reduce the control energy through small augmentation of the number of control signals beyond @xmath0 . in this regard , the quantity @xmath0 , on which the structural controllability theories focus , can effectively be regarded as the lower bound of the actual number of control signals required .",
    "to realize actual control of a complex network , it is imperative to find the trade - off between the number of external input signals and feasible energy consumption .",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite , partial theoretical bounds for the control energy were derived .",
    "the bounds are partial because , for example , for networks whose lower bounds can be obtained , the upper bounds typically diverge .",
    "this property of divergence was puzzling : does it mean that the actual energy required would diverge as well and , if so , can a complex network actually be controlled ?",
    "the present work was largely motivated by these questions , in which we obtain a detailed understanding of the physically important issue of practical controllability of complex networks through the discovery of a general scaling law for the distribution of the energy required for control .",

    "the idea of exploiting the length of control chain can also be used to explain the algebraic scaling behavior in the energy consumption . as discussed , identifying maximum matching so that the network is deemed structurally controllable is independent of the control energy . however , when maximum matching is found , we can divide the whole network into @xmath0 control signal paths ( csps ) , each being a unidirectional 1d string led by a driver node that passes the control signal onto every node along the path , as illustrated by the vertical paths in fig .",

    "[ fig : path_chain_lcc](a ) .",
    "it may seem that the latter class are less important as the control signal and energy flow along the former set of links .",

    ", any driver node connects with nodes both along and outside its csp .",
    "correspondingly , an arbitrary node in the network is influenced by every driver node , directly through the csp to which it belongs , or indirectly through the csps that it does not sit on . intuitively , the ability of a driver node to influence a node becomes weaker as the distance between them is increased . in order to control a distant node , exponentially increased energy from the driver is needed .",
    "the chain starting from a driver node and ending at a non - driver node along their shortest path is effectively a control chain .",

    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : path_chain_lcc](b ) , where we see that , although there can be multiple lccs , the ends of them converge to only three nodes , leading to @xmath78 . since the energy required to control a 1d chain grows exponentially with its length in such a way that even one unit of increase in the length can amplify the energy by several orders of magnitude [ fig .",
    "[ fig : eigen_h](a ) ] , the energy associated with any chain shorter than the lcc can typically be several orders of magnitude smaller than that with the lcc .",
    "thus , the total energy is dominated by the lccs . due to the low value of typical @xmath77",

    "accordingly , a longer lcc tends to have smaller value of degeneracy @xmath77 . as a result ,",

    "say we wish to introduce a small number of extra control signals . due to the @xmath77 degeneracy in the end nodes lccs",
    ", it seems that the number of redundant control inputs should exceed @xmath77 if every lcc receives one such signal .",
    "however , since even a unity deduction in the lcc length can significantly lower the control energy , a simpler strategy is to place one redundant control input at each of the @xmath77 end - nodes to which all possible lccs converge . in this case , each lcc in the network is broken into a chain of length @xmath307 and a single node , and consequently , the control energy is now determined by one - dimensional chains of length @xmath307 instead of length @xmath91 .",
    "figure  [ fig : redundancy](a ) shows the effects of two optimization strategies to introduce redundant control signals on the energy distribution : applying one redundant control signal ( i ) at the middle and ( ii ) at the end of each and every lcc , respectively . for comparison , for each strategy",
    ", the same number of redundant control inputs are also applied randomly throughout the network .",
    "the ratio between the control energy under optimization strategy , @xmath308 , and the original control energy @xmath80 characterizes the effectiveness of the optimization strategies . in particular ,",
    "if the distribution of @xmath309 is concentrated on small values of @xmath309 , then the corresponding optimization strategy can be deemed to be effective . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : redundancy](a ) , both optimization strategies outperform the random strategies , with strategy ( i ) performing slightly better than ( ii ) .",
    "the networks requiring proper optimization to be practically controlled are typically those with long control diameters .",
    "figures  [ fig : redundancy](b - d ) show that this is indeed the case .",
    "we consider a cascade parallel r - c circuit consisting of three identical resistors and capacitors as an example to illustrate how the circuit can be abstracted into a directed network , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sup_circuit ] . for convenience ,",
    "we set @xmath310 and @xmath311 , and denote the currents through @xmath312 , @xmath313 , and @xmath314 as @xmath315 , @xmath316 , and @xmath317 , respectively . the equations of the circuit are @xmath318 after some algebraic manipulation , we have @xmath319 which can be written as @xmath320 setting @xmath321 and @xmath322 , we have @xmath323 where @xmath324 is the adjacency matrix of the network representing the circuit , and @xmath325 is the control input matrix .",
    "the circuit has then been transferred into a @xmath326-node bidirectional 1d chain network with adjacency matrix @xmath13 .    without loss of generality",
    ", we inject an extra external current input @xmath327 into the capacitor @xmath328 , and the circuit equations become : @xmath329 the state equations are @xmath330 where @xmath331 is the control input matrix of the circuit under the original control input @xmath85 on node @xmath211 and a redundant control input @xmath327 to node @xmath332 .",
    "similarly , the redundant control input can be injected into any capacitor .",
    "it is necessary to keep all other nodes unaffected while introducing exactly one extra control input into the circuit .",
    "however , any additional voltage change in any part of the circuit can lead to voltage changes on all the capacitors .",
    "a change in the current through a capacitor will not affect the currents in other components of the network , since only the time derivative of its voltage is affected .",
    "thus , a meaningful way to introduce an extra control signal input to one node of a circuit s network is to inject current into one particular capacitor in the circuit .",
