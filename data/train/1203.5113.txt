    "this combination provides a unique opportunity to study the physical mechanisms of grbs across the entire electromagnetic spectrum .",

    "events of interest must be visible to the lat which imposes a boresight angle restriction of less than 74@xmath4 .",
    "191 gbm and 43 @xmath3 triggers pass this lat acceptance criterion including 15 gbm/@xmath3 simultaneous detections . for the gbm - tagged events which impose looser restrictions on the burst location",

    "the selection of high energy grb candidates presented in this paper is based on the criterion that the number of random background events with greater or equal matched filter weight within the appropriate trigger classification be less than 0.05 events ( ie .",
    "5% false positive probability ) .",
    "the matched filter weight prescriptions for the gbm and @xmath3-triggered data are given in papers a10 and a11 respectively .",

    "first of all , class 4 ( ultraclean photon ) has been officially assigned to photons since april 2011 . since this is a proper subset of class 3 ( clean ) , we treat class 4 photons the same as class 3 in this analysis .",

    "a similar study was performed as described for grb 120107a .",

    "a @xmath3/xrt too observation was requested and approved but unfortunately could not be performed since the grb location was close to the sun .",
    "as this manuscript was being completed , another grb 120316a ( zheng & akerlof 2012c ) was detected by our lat data pipeline and confirmed in location by the ipn collaboration ( hurley et al .",
    "2012 ) . the successful detection of grb 120107a and 120316a by our technique provides an opportunity for guiding optical follow - up observations using the higher accuracy of the matched filter lat localizations .",
    "prior to the @xmath0 launch , we expected that the lat would provide prompt estimates of grb locations with error circles of the order of a few degrees in radius that would enable ground - based facilities with large fields of view such as our rotse project to locate the optical counterparts quickly enough to enable a wide variety of observations at all wavelengths .",
    "we soon learned that the lat data stream was constrained to infrequent downlinks so such possibilities were eliminated by the mission design .",
    "given the low rate of grb detections , we came to the conclusion that any increase in the number of identified events would be useful . by applying the matched filter techniques to the lat data , we have identified 7 grbs so far in lat data , clearly demonstrating the advantage for detecting the fainter lat grbs .",
    "although the lat data downlink has a median latency time of @xmath2 4 - 5 hours , there is still some chance for guiding optical follow - up observation . although the probability of finding an optical counterpart is low , for brighter events ( e.g. grb 990123 , akerlof et al .",

    ", the number of new grb identifications is surprisingly low . as a reference point ,",
    "the brightness of local objects taken from a spatially homogeneous population should follow a power - law with index = -3/2 for the cumulative distribution .",
    "for the brightest and presumably closest gbm - detected grbs ( @xmath215% ) , the photon count distribution follows this quite closely ( see figure 4 - 7 in paciesas et al .",

    "we have turned to the smirnov - cramr - von mises ( s - c - vm ) statistic ( eadie et al . 1971 ) to achieve such independence .",
    "the input to the fitting process started with the random selection of an event direction with respect to the lat z - axis restricted by the maximum boresight acceptance angle of 74@xmath4 .",
    "the photon number was generated by the inversion of the formula for the cumulative distribution of a power law and multiplied by the lat effective area .",

    "this result with a cumulative distribution exponent of -0.8 is significantly different than the -3/2 value for bright gbm events for which the s - c - vm test would predict about 4% likelihood .",
    "the high probability that the actual data is fit by a simple power law also suggests that there is no compelling argument for dividing the sample into separate dim and bright components .",
    "the natural next question is how many grbs might possibly be detected with energetic photons if they originate from a homogeneous distribution . during the 1230 days that span the interval between the first and last event in table 2 ,",

    "not is one of the most critical questions facing this subfield of astrophysics .",
    "one obvious possibility is that lat grbs are specifically associated with only the events that are brightest at lower energies .",

    "two conclusions emerge : ( 1 ) , lat grb events are strongly associated with luminous gbm events and ( 2 ) , even after accounting for the luminosity bias , a substantial fraction of grbs still do not emit detectable high energy photons .",
    "the fact that , occasionally , short duration grbs are also found to be high energy photon emitters suggests that this phenomenon is a generic property of energetic jets uncorrelated with the details of the progenitor .",

    "the shallow power law distribution of the numbers of photons in each event and the apparent correlation with lower energies is an intriguing development which should be tested with greater statistics . we hope that this has begun to address the mysterious nature of the relation between the very large number of gbm events and the much smaller subset at higher energies .",

    "<S> launched on june 11 , 2008 , the lat instrument onboard the @xmath0 gamma - ray space telescope has provided a rare opportunity to study high energy photon emission from gamma - ray bursts . although the majority of such events ( 27 ) have been identified by the fermi lat collaboration , four were uncovered by using more sensitive statistical techniques ( akerlof et al 2010 , akerlof et al 2011 , zheng et al 2012 ) . in this paper , we continue our earlier work by finding three more grbs associated with high energy photon emission , grb 110709a , 111117a and 120107a . to systematize our matched filter approach , a pipeline has been developed to identify these objects in near real time . </S>",
    "<S> grb 120107a is the first product of this analysis procedure . despite the reduced threshold for identification , </S>",
    "<S> the number of grb events has not increased significantly . </S>",
    "<S> this relative dearth of events with low photon number prompted a study of the apparent photon number distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we find an extremely good fit to a simple power - law with an exponent of -1.8 @xmath1 0.3 for the differential distribution . </S>",
    "<S> as might be expected , there is a substantial correlation between the number of lower energy photons detected by the gbm and the number observed by the lat . </S>",
    "<S> thus , high energy photon emission is associated with some but not all of the brighter gbm events . </S>",
    "<S> deeper studies of the properties of the small population of high energy emitting bursts may eventually yield a better understanding of these entire phenomena . </S>"
