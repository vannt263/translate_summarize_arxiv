    "as in bulk ferromagnetic metals , the low - energy excitations of the nanoparticles that were probed in these experiments involve both particle - hole excitations of the electronic quasiparticles and quantized collective excitations of the magnetization - orientation field that appears in the classical micromagnetic theory . in an initial attempt to achieve an understanding of the novel physics evident in the external field dependence of the experimental excitation spectra , two of us recently@xcite analyzed a simple quantum model with long range exchange interactions .",
    "we were able to demonstrate explicitly that the low - energy excitations of a ferromagnetic metal nanoparticle are specified by the occupation numbers of its quasiparticle orbitals , as in a fermi liquid , _ and _ by the global orientation of the aligned spins of all single - occupied ( and therefore spin - polarized ) orbitals .",
    "this model is not , however , able to account realistically for the influence of spin - orbit interactions , which play the essential role in controlling the complex hysteretic behavior seen in these experiments@xcite .",
    "kleff , von delft , deshmukh and ralph@xcite have proposed that the single - electron tunneling spectroscopy experiments can be explained by accounting for non - equilibrium spin accumulation , and by assuming that the magnetic anisotropy energy of a small magnetic particle has surprisingly large fluctuations as a function of the number of electrons on the particle .",

    "our conclusions follow from qualitative arguments based on perturbation theory expressions for the influence of spin - orbit interactions on quasiparticle energy levels , and on numerical studies of a simplified model that we believe is sufficiently realistic to describe generic aspects of the interrelated mesoscopic physics of quasiparticle energy - levels and magnetic anisotropy energy in ferromagnetic metal nanoparticles .",

    "surprisingly , we find no measurable correlation between the contributions to magnetic anisotropy from quasiparticles that are close in energy in this limit . as a result of the statistical properties of the quasiparticle magnetic anisotropies , the total magnetic anisotropy per atom fluctuates by several percents when the number of electrons in the nanoparticle changes by one , even for particles containing 260 atoms . finally , in agreement with experiment@xcite , we find that the quasiparticle excitation spectrum exhibits a complex non - monotonic behavior as a function of an external magnetic field , with abrupt jumps when the magnetization orientation of a nanoparticle changes discontinuously in response to the field .",

    "the additional anisotropy due to magnetic dipole interactions is also sensitive to the overall nanoparticle shape , but is not included here because it is generally less important for nanoparticles than for macroscopic samples .",

    "the most delicate physics of a ferromagnetic nanoparticle , and in our view the most interesting , is that associated with magnetization direction reorientation by weak external magnetic fields .",

    "this standard procedure leads to a hamiltonian that can be diagonalized numerically and to a self - consistency condition that can be solved iteratively to determine the mean - field order parameters . for the present calculation",
    "we have simplified this procedure further , by averaging the spin - splitting exchange mean field , @xmath43 over all sites .",
    "our motivation for doing so is to simplify the magnetic anisotropy energy landscape discussed below , forcing all spins to change their orientations coherently .",
    "we recognize that complicated non - collinear spin configurations@xcite commonly occur in magnetic nanoparticles , and that under the action of an external field small groups of atoms can change their orientation relative to other parts of the nanoparticle .",

    "since we are interested only in generic aspects of the ferromagnetic nanoparticle physics there is little to gain from the additional realism that could be achieved by performing self - consistent spin - density functional calculations .    given the averaged spin - splitting field @xmath45 , the mean - field hamiltonian is now a single - body operator    @xmath46    the self - consistent spin - spitting field is also the field , denoted by @xmath47 below , at which the total ground - state energy function @xmath48 is minimized .",

    "these shifts have the same typical size as the spin - orbit scattering lifetime broadening energies of very large particles , @xmath248 .",
    "the quasi - particle levels of small nanoparticles in which @xmath249 evolve in a complicated way as a function of magnetization orientation and external magnetic field , with relatively small avoided crossing gaps and spin - orbit shifts of nearby orbitals that are nearly uncorrelated .",
    "the size of the avoided crossing gaps is determined by matrix element of the spin - orbit coupling operator between quasiparticle energy levels that are adjacent in energy .",
    "surprisingly , even though expectation values of these matrix elements vanish because of angular momentum quenching , typical values between energetically adjacent orbitals are comparable to those for orbitals at any position in the spectrum . eventually , for nanoparticles with more than @xmath250 atoms ,",
    "the typical avoided crossing gap estimated in this way becomes comparable to the level spacing and we expect the crossover to the strong coupling limit is complete .",
    "nanoparticles with fewer than @xmath251 atoms can easily be prepared with current synthesis techniques and systems of experimental interest are often in the middle of the crossover between small particle and bulk ( weak and strong spin - orbit coupling ) limits .",
    "for example , the nanoparticles investigated by electron tunneling experiments contain between 50 and 1500 atoms@xcite .    for nanoparticles in the size range we are able to study numerically , @xmath208 smaller than a few hundred , we find that the anisotropy energy per atom displays large changes of order several percent when the electron or atom number changes by one .",
    "our analysis allows us to make a connection between the microscopic model of a metal nanomagnet and more familiar classical micromagnetic energy functional expressions which are normally used to interpret the results of switching - field experiments@xcite .",
    "the ground - state energy as a function of the magnetization direction is characterized by minima separated by energy barriers .",
    "the quasi - particle levels exhibit a complex non - monotonic behavior and abrupt jumps when the magnetization direction is reversed by an external magnetic field .",
    "the nanoparticles investigated by electron tunneling experiments contain between 50 and 1500 atoms@xcite .",
    "the results that we have presented here are therefore particularly relevant for the interpretation of these experiments . in particular , we find that the anisotropy fluctuations inferred from interpretations of these experiments are indeed to be expected .",
    "similarly , the dependence of the tunneling resonances on the external magnetic field is qualitatively similar to the behavior of the quasi - particle excitations of our model , although it appears necessary to invoke non - equilibrium quasiparticle configurations@xcite in the nanoparticle in order to understand the size of the quasiparticle level spacing .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank mandar deshmukh and dan ralph for several discussions about their experimental results , and jan von delft for stimulating and informative interactions .",
