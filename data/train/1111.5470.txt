    "the model computations are based on the 2 dimensional , general relativistic mhd code harm2d , described in ref .  .",
    "the nuclear equation of state is discussed in detail in ref .  .",
    "the goal of our preliminary test calculations is to investigate the overall structure of an accretion disk in which nuclear reactions take place and the gas looses energy via neutrino cooling .",
    "we assume the gas to be in beta equilibrium , so that the ratio of proton to neutron satisfies the balance between forward and backward nuclear reactions .",
    "we assume neutrino cooling via electron , muon and tau neutrinos in the plasma opaque to their absorption and scattering .",
    "neutrinos are formed in the following processes : urca process , electron positron pair annihilation , nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung , plasmon decay .",
    "we solve grmhd equations using numerical code harm2d . in our model",
    ", the gas is composed of mixture of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , so the total fluid energy is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the total rest mass energy density and @xmath4 is the total internal energy density and where @xmath5 .",
    "the total gas pressure is @xmath6 .",
    "all particles have a common temperature : @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and we assume polytropic equation of state @xmath9 , with adiabatic index @xmath10 .",
    "we do not include the radiation and neutrino pressure in the dynamical calculation , but we do account for a neutrino cooling .",
    "after each timestep , we compute the new gas composition and neutrino cooling rates @xmath11 as described in ref .  .",
    "the total internal energy is reduced using explicit method with @xmath12-sub - cycles in each time step .",
    "the cooling function @xmath11 also accounts for neutrino absorption and scattering on free neutrons and protons .",
    "the optical thicknesses for absorptions and scatterings are calculated assuming approximate disk vertical thickness @xmath13 and local proton and neutron number densities .",
    "therefore in the dense disk regions the cooling is effectively zero .",
    "we start the numerical calculation from the equilibrium model based on ref .   around a spinning black hole .",
    "the central black hole mass is @xmath14 and the total mass of the surrounding gas is about 0.1 @xmath15 .",
    "harm2d code is designed to solve the magnetohydrodynamic equations in the stationary metric .",
    "we assume dimensionless spin of a black hole to be @xmath16 . for higher disk masses , a fully general relativistic model including the evolution of the space - time and spin of the black hole should be considered .",
    "the initial magnetic field is assumed with toroidal component of vector potential @xmath17 ( magnetic filed lines follow the constant density surfaces i.e. they form loops concentrated around the pressure maximum ) and normalized with @xmath18 .",
    "the torus around the spinning black hole at hyper - eddington rates is cooled by neutrinos ( e.g. , as shown in 1-d model in ref .  ) .",
    "here we also study such tori , however to quantify the effect of neutrino cooling in mhd simulations , we run a starting test model with no cooling assumed . in figure  [ fig1 ] , we show the structure of such a torus ( model 1 ) .",
    "the snapshots present the baryon density ( @xmath19 ) , gas temperature t and magnetic @xmath20 parameter .",
    "we also show the topology of magnetic field lines .    a turbulent and dense rotating torus forms in the equatorial plane and extends towards the marginally stable orbit of the black hole .",
    "the polar regions are quickly evacuated and an electromagnetically dominated jet is formed above the poles of the black hole , as shown before in refs .  - .",
    "the mass accretion rate is @xmath21 .",
    "in figure  [ fig2 ] we show model 2 , in which the neutrino cooling is accounted for in the dynamical evolution .",
    "the initial conditions in model 2 are the same as in model 1 .",
    "the mass accretion rate remains the same as in model 1 , but the structure of the disk changes .",
    "the disk is geometrically thinner and strongly magnetized in comparison to model 1 .",
    "we compute the neutrino emissivity at t=0.02 s. the total neutrino luminosity corrected for absorption and scattering processes , is @xmath22 erg s@xmath23 ( figure  [ fig2 ] , left panel ) .",
    "this number is comparable to numbers obtained from relativistic hydrodynamical simulations , e.g. in refs .  - .",
    "also , the relativistic mhd simulations in ref .   reported the neutrino luminosity on the order of @xmath24 erg s@xmath23 , depending on black hole spin ( @xmath25 ) and torus mass . to compute the electromagnetic luminosity of the observed grbs",
    ", one needs to consider the efficiency of neutrino - antineutrino annihilation process , as well as swallowing of some fraction of neutrinos by the black hole due to the curvature effects .    in figure  [ fig2 ] ( most right panel ) , we show the effective neutrino cooling .",
    "the most neutrinos are formed within @xmath26 .",
    "we do not see a clear neutrinosphere ( a surface at which the optical thickness for neutrino absorption and scattering is 1.0 ) .",
    "its presence as well as the effect of neutrino trapping will be accounted when the neutrino pressure is incorporated in the dynamical calculations .",
