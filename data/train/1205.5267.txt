    "<S> the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is a highly predictive theory which seems to be completely verified with the recent discovery @xcite of a particle which could be the long - sought higgs boson . in the forthcoming years </S>",

    "<S> recent experimental results from tevatron @xcite could be indicating np effects in the @xmath3 forward - backward asymmetry , where the main production mechanism is through quark - fusion , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> although many theoretical proposals @xcite have been issued in this direction , there has not been any kind of confirmation of such a signal in the related observables at the lhc @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the lhc is a machine which delivers huge amounts of data , but for different reasons , it is very hard to see a np signal over the background . </S>",
    "<S> although the main reason for this difficulty is usually its hadronic character which makes the qcd background a central problem , in this letter we address a different issue which concerns the production mechanisms for @xmath0 pairs . at the lhc , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 production comes from @xmath6 and therefore is mainly driven by gluon - fusion production ( @xmath7 accounts for @xmath8 at the 8tev lhc ) . </S>",
    "<S> if there would be a np contribution which couples exclusively to quarks , then it will be diluted because of the little proportion of quark - fusion events . </S>",
    "<S> if the np contribution is already small compared to sm quark fusion @xmath0 production , then its effects will be highly suppressed in a raw @xmath0 sample . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of this note is to enhance the sensitivity in the search of np by selecting the sample in such a way that the quark - fusion fraction of the sample is increased .     </S>",

    "<S> the percentage numbers in the plot indicate the part of the original sample that passes the cuts at that point . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical dashed line at @xmath11 gev indicates the maximum experimental resolution @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> there are mainly three simple kinematic features which can be used to increase the ratio of quark- to gluon - fusion events in @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the first one comes from the proton parton density functions ( pdf s ) : since valence quarks are more likely to have more momentum than the gluons and the sea quarks , then the events in which the @xmath0 pair is boosted along the beam axis have an incremental probability of coming from quark - fusion production @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this may be quantified through the variable @xcite = , [ beta ] where @xmath13 is the momentum of the @xmath14 quark in the @xmath15 direction and @xmath16 its energy . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 ranges from 0 to 1 , and as @xmath18 the boosting of the @xmath0 pair along the axis is increased and hence also the probability of coming from quark - fusion . the second kinematic feature which helps to recognize quark - fusion events is the transverse momentum of the @xmath0 pair , @xmath19 : since hard gluons in the initial state are more likely to emit initial state radiation ( isr ) than quarks , then events with small @xmath19 have an incremental probability to have been produced through quark - fusion . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this isr differentiation comes from the qcd lagrangian , where the color factor in gluon radiation from a gluon line is @xmath20 times larger than from a quark line . </S>",
    "<S> this property has been previously used in top physics at the lhc @xcite and also in higgs physics @xcite . the third variable which can be used to enhance </S>",
    "<S> the quark - fusion content of a sample is the @xmath0 invariant mass , @xmath21 , however since the purpose of this work is to study the @xmath21-spectrum we will not use this variable . </S>",
    "<S> there are other variables @xcite concerning top polarization and spin correlation which are harder to implement from the experimental point of view , but could eventually also help to differentiate quark- from gluon - fusion .    to illustrate how the first two features mentioned above are implemented in a @xmath0 sample , </S>",
    "<S> we have plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ qqbarfraction ] how the quark - fusion fraction is modified as different combined cuts in @xmath17 and @xmath19 are applied to an original lhc @xmath5 raw sample . </S>",
    "<S> we also point in the figure the strength of the cut with respect to the original sample . </S>",
    "<S> the plot gives a good description of the expected @xmath0 sample as a function of the relevant variables of the problem . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation in the figure is at parton - level showered by ` pythia ` @xcite to include the isr effects . </S>",
    "<S> given the previous paragraph discussion we now investigate how a selection that increases the quark - fusion fraction could enhance the sensitivity to np in the study of the @xmath21-spectrum </S>",
    "<S> . this kind of selection will enhance the np contribution if the new particle couples to quarks and not to gluons . </S>",
    "<S> many of the np proposals to solve the tevatron @xmath22 puzzle will give a contribution with these features at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , if the np is in an @xmath23-channel then a resonant peak will be enhanced over the background .    in order to study np effects in the @xmath21-spectrum , </S>",
    "<S> we have simulated @xmath0 production for the sm and for a benchmark resonant np model . </S>",
    "<S> we have used ` madgraph5 ` @xcite to simulate the 2012 expected @xmath0 production for @xmath24 fb@xmath25 at the 8tev lhc . we have showered the parton level outcome with ` pythia ` @xcite to include the initial state radiation . to avoid double counting , </S>",
    "<S> we have matched the matrix element with up to one extra jet to the parton shower through the mlm scheme @xcite implemented in ` madgraph5 ` . </S>",
    "<S> we have used a k - factor of 1.55 which comes out from comparing the same simulation at 7 tev to @xmath0 production at nnll order @xcite at this energy . </S>",
    "<S> we have assumed an overall 6% selection efficiency @xcite to estimate the number of available @xmath0 semileptonic events by the end of the 2012 run .    as a benchmark model </S>",
    "<S> we have taken a gluon prime resonance of mass @xmath26 gev , couplings to the right top @xmath27 ( @xmath28 the strong coupling ) and to the other right quarks @xmath29 , whereas all other couplings are set to zero . </S>",
    "<S> these couplings yield a width @xmath30 gev . </S>",
    "<S> this benchmark model comes from the allowed points in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and besides of successfully explaining the cdf forward - backward asymmetry @xcite also passes the constraints imposed by the lhc charge - asymmetries @xcite and , due to its small coupling to light quarks , the dijet np searches @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the production cross section for this resonance is @xmath31 and @xmath32 pb at the 7 and 8 tev lhc , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these values should be compared to the @xmath33 pb production cross section at 7 tev of the resonance which is ruled out in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite through a @xmath21-spectrum bump search .    </S>",
    "<S> we have computed and compared the @xmath21-spectrum for the sm and the np benchmark model . </S>",
    "<S> we have divided both spectrum with @xmath34 gev bins and compared them through a @xmath35 test in a region that includes the @xmath36 resonance . </S>",
    "<S> we have first used only statistic error bars and then included a simple model for systematic error bars to avoid the misleading behaviour of tiny error bars due to the large sample .    </S>",
    "<S> if only statistic error bars are taken into account , we have found that the increase in the statistic error bars due to the selection cut spoils the visibility of the np bump . </S>",
    "<S> this happens even though the np bump is enhanced by the selection cut . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is not realistic , since given the large number of @xmath0 pairs expected in the lhc one is hardly ever in a pure statistic regime and systematic error bars are required as well in the analysis . since </S>",
    "<S> systematic error bars are found to be decisive in this analysis , a final state realistic analysis could only be performed through a correct computation of theoretical and detector systematic uncertainties by the corresponding experimental group . </S>",
    "<S> we confine in this letter to use at parton level a simple model for systematic error bars based on experimental data , and show that the proposed selection cut will in principle enhance the sensitivity in the search for np . only the real experimental analysis could quantify the expected enhancement in the sensitivity of the @xmath21-spectrum in the search of np .    to model the systematic uncertainties we use the rate - changing systematic error bars pointed out in table @xmath37 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where the 2011 @xmath21-spectrum is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we find , for the case of one @xmath38-tagged jet , that these systematic error bars account for a @xmath39 systematic rate - changing error in the data . </S>",
    "<S> there is no simple way to simulate the shape - changing error bars indicated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> given that we expect the rate- and shape - changing systematic errors to be reduced , we model in this letter a @xmath40 total systematic error bars in the 2012 expected @xmath0 selected events . </S>",
    "<S> this is a very simple and qualitative model for the systematic error bars which follows the only purpose of avoiding unrealistic tiny error bars when only statistic uncertainties are taken into account .    </S>",
    "<S> we have compared the @xmath21-spectrum for the sm and the np benchmark model when including the statistic and systematic uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied how these two spectrum differentiate as we perform single cuts only in @xmath19 or @xmath17 and also in a combination of them , which in all cases increase the quark - fusion content in the selected sample .    </S>",
    "<S> we first analyze the case of single cuts in @xmath19 and @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> if we take the reference cuts in these variables to be @xmath41 gev and @xmath42 in each case respectively , one may qualitatively predict the results using fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ qqbarfraction ] . </S>",
    "<S> we see from the figure that in both cases we may expect a quark - fusion fraction of approximately @xmath43 in the selected sample . </S>",
    "<S> this fraction comes from the value of the @xmath44 ( red dot - dashed ) line at @xmath11 gev and the limit of the @xmath45 ( black solid ) line for @xmath46 . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , we see that the case of only cutting in @xmath19 keeps a @xmath47% of the sample , whereas the case of only cutting in @xmath17 keeps only a @xmath48% ( not shown in the figure ) , henceforth we would expect that in a regime of statistic error dominance the cut in @xmath19 would perform better since the statistic error increases less with the cut . </S>",
    "<S> however , given the large luminosity collected insofar at the lhc , these percentages for the selected sample do not put in any risk a systematic error regime and , therefore , we may expect a similar behaviour of both cuts in enhancing the sensitivity of the @xmath21-spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we have compared the sm and np @xmath21-spectrum for the @xmath42 and @xmath41 gev selection methods through a @xmath35 test for @xmath34 gev bins in @xmath21 in the @xmath49 to @xmath50 gev region and found @xmath51-values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively for each method . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the @xmath51-values achieved with both cuts are statistically similar , as expected from previous arguments . </S>",
    "<S> we also see that none of both cuts is enough to differentiate np from sm and , henceforth , they should be combined . </S>",
