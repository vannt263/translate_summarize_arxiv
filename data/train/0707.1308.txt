    "cold ( @xmath810 k ) , moderately dense ( @xmath9 @xmath10 ) dark clouds are the sites of low mass star formation . they exhibit a complex gas - phase ion - neutral chemistry leading to the formation of a large variety of molecules .",
    "the lack of internal heating sources and violent physical processes , like shocks , make these dense and quiescent cores the best sites to explore and to model interstellar gas - phase chemistry and molecular depletion into the dust grain surfaces .",
    "the dense filament tmc-1 , embedded in the heiles cloud 2 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the taurus region , is one of the richest molecular sources , with a large wealth of organic species such as unsaturated carbon chain radicals ( c@xmath11h ) and cyanopolyynes ( hc@xmath12n ) .",
    "whereas a common and well adopted view in the literature is to consider this region as dense , cold and quiescent ( as indicated by the extremelly narrow lines ) , some authors suggest that the presence of shocks could induce explosive injection of grain mantles and contribute to the formation of large carbon molecules such as methylcyanodiacetilene @xcite .",
    "the history of molecular astronomy shows that interstellar molecules can be detected by specific searches , when frequencies are known and one has hints that a certain molecule is abundant .",
    "the most unexpected discoveries , however , resulted from spectral line surveys or were serendipitous .",
    "to our knowledge there are only two spectral line surveys of dark clouds , both in the direction of tmc-1 .",
    "one was carried out using the nobeyama radio telescope @xcite in the 8.8 - 50 ghz domain , with 414 detected lines arising from 38 different molecules , 11 of them unknown prior to the survey .",
    "only two of the 38 species are diatomic ( cs and so ) , four are triatomic and the rest are polyatomic , the longest one having 11 atoms ( hc@xmath13n ) .",
    "the other survey was performed at lower frequencies , with the arecibo radio telescope @xcite , covering the range 46 ghz besides selected frequencies in the 810 ghz interval .",
    "they detected 29 lines arising from carbon - chain species such as c@xmath14h , h@xmath0c@xmath14 , hc@xmath1n , hc@xmath15n , hc@xmath16n , hc@xmath13n , c@xmath0s and c@xmath1s .",
    "apart from co and no , all observed molecules in dark clouds usually have large dipole moments and most of them have rather low abundances ( a few 10@xmath17 ) . from this",
    ", one would naively expect that only polyatomic molecules with a large dipole moment should be detectable .",
    "due to the low kinetic temperature of these clouds , heavy molecules will have their emission peak in the centimeter and millimeter wavelength domains . as a result of a 3 mm spectral line survey of several dark cloud cores ( marcelino et al . in prep . ) and follow - up observations performed thereafter , we report the first detection of interstellar propylene ( ch@xmath0chch@xmath1 ) .",
    "this unexpected , nearly saturated hydrocarbon was detected toward tmc-1 .",
    "this species , which is naively expected in hot cores rather than in dark clouds , has so far not been considered in any chemical model of tmc-1 in spite of having an abundance similar to that of c - c@xmath1h@xmath0 .",
    "the observations were carried out with the iram 30-meter telescope near granada ( spain ) two sis receivers sensitive in the 3 mm band were used simultaneously at the same frequency .",
    "both receivers were tuned in single sideband mode with image rejections of @xmath1820 db .",
    "system temperatures were between 110150 k during all observing periods .",
    "we used frequency switching mode with a frequency throw of 1.8 mhz ( survey observations ) , while a throw of 7.2 mhz was used to obtain the new spectra outside the survey range in order to remove instrumental ripples and to improve baselines ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "the backend was the vespa autocorrelator , with 40 khz of spectral resolution ( @xmath180.13 kms@xmath19 ) , providing a maximum effective bandwidth of 315 mhz .",
    "intensity calibration was performed using two absorbers at different temperatures , and the atmospheric opacity was obtained from measurements of the sky emissivity and using the atm code @xcite . on -",
    "source integration times were typically @xmath183 hours . pointing and focus were checked on strong and nearby sources every 1.5 and 3 hours respectively .",
    "the temperature scale is main - beam brightness temperature ( @xmath20 ) . at the observed frequencies the beamwidth of the antenna is 2429@xmath21 and the main beam efficiency is 0.780.75 .",
    "the observed lines are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig_lines ] and the line parameters are given in table  [ tab : lines ] .",
    "during the 3 mm line survey of tmc-1 , which was obtained in several observing runs between 2003 and 2007 , we detected a pair of lines at 86.650 ghz with similar intensities and separated by 3 kms@xmath19 , towards the cyanopolyyne peak ( cp ) of this source [ r.a.(j2000.0)=04@xmath22 41@xmath23 41.9@xmath24 , decl.(j2000.0)=+25@xmath25 41@xmath26 27.1@xmath21 ] .",
    "these lines appear neither in the jpl nor in the cdms catalogs @xcite . using the spectral line catalog developed and maintained at the damir - iem - csic @xcite",
    ", we tentatively identified these two lines as one doublet arising from the @xmath28 rotational transition ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 species ) of propylene ( also called propene , ch@xmath0chch@xmath1 ) in the survey data of tmc-1 .",
    "this molecule , whose structure is depicted in fig .  [ fig : fig_molec ] , is an internal rotor with a moderately high barrier against the torsion of the methyl group .",
    "this internal rotation produces a splitting of each rotational line by a value in the range of 0.3 mhz to 4 mhz , each member of the doublet belonging to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 species .",
    "its rotational spectrum has been measured in the laboratory between 8245 ghz @xcite and up to 412 ghz @xcite , which allows accurate frequency predictions within the frequency domain of our search .",
    "it has a small dipole moment , @xmath29=0.36 d , @xmath30=0.05 d @xcite .    encouraged by this tentative identification , we searched for other transitions of this molecule in the frequency range covered by our survey ( 85.993 ghz ) .",
    "the fact that the lines must appear as a doublet separated by 0.34 mhz , and having similar intensities helped us in the search . using the mentioned catalog , which contains only complete predictions for the @xmath2 species , together with the frequencies measured in the laboratory for the @xmath3 species @xcite , three more doublets at 87.1 ghz , 87.7 ghz and 90.0 ghz were identified at the 34 @xmath31 level .",
    "director s discretionary time at the 30-m telescope was used to confirm the identification of propylene in april and may 2007 : we re - observed the latter three mentioned doublets and searched for three additional doublets lying outside the frequency range of the survey , at 84.1 ghz , 100.9 ghz and 103.7 ghz .",
    "we detected all the lines searched for , except for the @xmath3 component of the 5@xmath32 - 4@xmath33 transition at 84.1 ghz , for which the frequency is not known , since this transition was not measured in the laboratory by @xcite .",
    "however , since the separation in frequency of each doublet is small , the @xmath3 line could be hidden by one hyperfine component of the @xmath34 transition of @xmath35cch at 84151.5 mhz ( see top panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_lines ] ) .",
    "in fact , this hyperfine component of @xmath35cch has a line strength twice less than that at 84153.4 mhz ( also shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_lines ] ) .",
    "therefore , with a total of 13 observed lines , the first detection of interstellar propylene is definitively confirmed in tmc-1 .",
    "line parameters were obtained from gaussian fits using the gildas package and are given in table  [ tab : lines ] .",
    "all the observed lines are centered at a systemic velocity around 5.6 km s@xmath19 , which is in agreement with that derived from other molecules in tmc-1 @xcite . however , several lines show a weaker second peak at a higher velocity , that could arise from the emission of a different component of the cloud , at 5.9 or 6.1 km s@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "line widths range from 0.3 to 0.6 kms@xmath19 , being sometimes wider than the expected value of @xmath180.4 kms@xmath19 .",
    "the larger widths could imply again the emission from another component of the cloud .",
    "collisional rates are not available for this molecule .",
    "hence we have used a standard rotational diagram , including both species , to derive its column density and the rotational temperature , @xmath36 , of the energy levels .",
    "we have obtained @xmath36 = 9.5@xmath372.0 k and @xmath38-ch@xmath0chch@xmath39-ch@xmath0chch@xmath1 ) = ( 2.0@xmath370.8 ) @xmath40 10@xmath35 @xmath5 , i.e. , a total column density for propylene of ( 4.0@xmath371.5 ) @xmath40 10@xmath35 @xmath5 .",
    "the rotational temperature is similar , within the errors , to that found for other species in tmc-1 @xcite .",
    "however , the column density of propylene is particularly high for a saturated species and for a molecule having 9 atoms ( compare table  [ tab : dens ] ) .",
    "it is similar to that of @xmath41-c@xmath1h@xmath0 and to that of ch@xmath1cch , which also contain the methyl group and has a rather low dipole moment ( see table  [ tab : dens ] ) .",
    "it is worth to note that for some transitions the @xmath3 species shows a slightly higher intensity than the @xmath2 species ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_lines ] and table  [ tab : lines ] ) , then the column density could be higher for the @xmath3 species .",
    "in fact , performing separate rotational diagrams for the two species , the derived rotational temperature for the @xmath3 species , @xmath42 = 12 k , is slightly higher than for the @xmath2 , @xmath42 = 8 k. the total column density , however , do not differ much from the value obtained with a single rotational diagram .",
    "hence , within experimental accuracy both species seem to have the same abundance .",
    "propylene , a rather simple hydrocarbon , has escaped detection because apparently nobody ever considered a directed search worthwhile , and also because of its small dipole moment , 10 times smaller than that of other three carbon molecules ( see table  [ tab : dens ] ) .",
    "@xcite already suggested that this molecule could be detected in space .",
    "however , as this hydrocarbon is nearly saturated , they pointed out that the best place to search for it could be hot cores in high - mass star forming regions . prior to this detection",
    ", we had already searched for propylene in the spectral line survey of orion ( tercero and cernicharo , in preparation ) , but no lines were found within a detection limit of 50 mk . we have checked the u - lines in previous line surveys of orion and sgr b2 at different frequency bands @xcite , and also the unidentified lines reported by @xcite towards tmc-1 .",
    "none of these lines coincide with the predicted strongest lines of propylene .",
    "the abundance of propylene relative to h@xmath0 in tmc-1 is 4 @xmath40 10@xmath43 , assuming that @xmath44(h@xmath0 ) = 10@xmath45 @xmath5 @xcite . in spite of being a fairly abundant hydrocarbon",
    ", it has not been previously considered in chemical models of dark clouds .",
    "reaction networks used to model interstellar chemistry are usually tested by comparing with the molecular abundances observed in tmc-1 @xcite .",
    "thus , much effort has been done to explore and include reactions leading to the formation of the observed molecules , the abundances of which are in general satisfactorily explained , although the chemistry of not observed molecules is far from complete .",
    "we have searched in the literature for reactions relevant to the chemistry of propylene and performed chemical models to investigate the most likely formation pathways .",
    "the synthesis of many hydrocarbons in dark clouds involve a sequence of ion - molecule reactions with the dissociative recombination ( dr ) of a molecular cation and an electron as the last step @xcite .",
    "thus , the dr of the c@xmath1h@xmath46 ion , which is known to produce c@xmath1h@xmath7 + h with a branching ratio of 0.42 @xcite , could be a key step in the synthesis of propylene .",
    "if so , the problem of producing propylene translates into how to form the ion c@xmath1h@xmath46 .",
    "condensation reactions of an ionic and a neutral hydrocarbon such as c@xmath0h@xmath47 + ch@xmath14 @xmath48 c@xmath1h@xmath46 + h as well as other similar ones , are endothermic , too slow or tend to produce products other than c@xmath1h@xmath46 @xcite .",
    "consideration of radiative association reactions of hydrocarbon ions with h@xmath0 is an interesting possibility when other channels are endothermic .",
    "we have checked that such a possibility occurs for c@xmath0h@xmath49 and larger hydrocarbon ions with 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 carbon atoms .",
    "however , the corresponding reaction rates are not available in the literature and different reaction channels may occur .",
    "introducing these reactions with realistic rate coefficient values and subsequent dissociative recombination allows to build propylene at a reasonable level .",
    "propylene could also be one of the products in the dr of ions larger than c@xmath1h@xmath46 .",
    "recent storage ring experiments have shown that substantial fragmentation , with break of c - c bonds , occurs in the dr of hydrocarbon ions @xcite .",
    "for example , chemical models predict an efficient synthesis of the ion c@xmath7h@xmath46 in dark clouds , the dr of which is assumed to give benzene and c@xmath7h@xmath0 ( both predicted with an abundance of @xmath18 10@xmath43 ; @xcite ) , although it could also produce smaller neutral fragments such as propylene .",
    "the synthesis of propylene through neutral - neutral reactions such as ch@xmath1 + c@xmath0h@xmath14 or c@xmath0h@xmath1 + ch@xmath14 is not effective as these reactions are endothermic .",
    "lastly , highly saturated hydrocarbons form easily in grain surfaces by direct hydrogenation , although it is not clear how these mantle - species would be desorbed to the gas phase at the low temperatures of dark clouds .",
    "a possibility is to involve shocks and their role in the release of saturated adsorbed species from the surface of the grains @xcite , or involve a local enhancement of the cosmic ionization rate which will have an important effect on the chemistry and evolutionary status of tmc-1 @xcite .",
    "however , the detected column density of methanol in tmc-1 does not support this scenario .",
    "furthermore , if this mechanism is working in tmc-1 , other hot - core like molecules ( ch@xmath1och@xmath1 , ch@xmath1ocoh ,  ) should be detectectable there .",
    "recent work on non thermal desorption mechanisms from dust grains @xcite show that some molecules formed on grain surfaces could go to the gas phase .",
    "the presence of hydrocarbons such as propene is an important information to improve the models as the hydrogenation proceeds on grain surfaces and the degree of surface hydrogenation increases with time . in any case",
    ", it seems that gas - phase chemistry is missing important reactions involving small hydrocarbons , which could make molecules like propylene to have large abundances .",
    "the detection of propylene suggest that other small hydrocarbons , like propane , could be present in dark clouds . a search for it is currently undergoing with the iram 30-m telescope .",
