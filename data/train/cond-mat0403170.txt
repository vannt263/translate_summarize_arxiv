    ". however , in describing such materials it is crucial to consider that they are not made of symmetrical entities .",
    "it is necessary to introduce at least one degree of freedom for the grain with some coupling to an external field .",
    "one can imagine that the degree of freedom , is called a  spin  , coupled to a  magnetic field ",
    ", though the  spin  can represent any non - magnetic physical feature of practical interest , like the grain roughness or shape feature .",
    "the spin role is to break the spatial isotropic symmetry .",
    "the direction of such a spin can represent the position of a grain with respect to neighboring entities , as well as a rotation process .",
    "the grain - grain interaction can be imagined to be some ( elastic - like ) potential containing information on the grain young , rigidity , bulk modulus , and poisson ratio , .. and geometric aspects @xcite .",
    "generalizations to more complex spin models are immediately imagined .",

    "something which is fully appreciated is the difference in constructing piles in presence or not of vertical walls .",
    "a pyramidal pile has not necessarily the same structure , arches , ... as a pile in a silo .",
    "moreover it is quite unrealistic to build a pile from a single grain faucet . finally , due to its anisotropic shape a grain can rotate during its fall e.g. in responding to the local wind , or difference in pressure between the upper and lower grain surfaces .",
    "such remarks have motivated us into re - examining a magnetic tetris - like model ( or a magnetic rain ) for which the grain is characterized by a ",
    "spin  which can flip during its fall under some energetic condition .    in this paper",
    "the role of changing the depositing spin flipping probability during its fall in such a mbd ( magnetic ballistic depositon ) model is shown to influence the pile density , the pile  magnetization  , and the cluster size distribution .",

    "a critical percolation line is found separating two regimes for the size ( mass ) distribution of clusters . finally , in sect.[sec : conclusions ] , a brief conclusion can be found .",
    "the algorithm for the so called @xmath0-mbd model , in contrast to the @xmath3-mbd model @xcite , goes as follows :    1 .",
    "first , we choose a horizontal substrate of spins with a predetermined ( for example antiferromagnetic - like or random ) configuration ; periodic boundary conditions are used ; 2 .   [",
    "item : step2 ] a falling ( up or down ) spin is dropped along one of the lattice columns from a height @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the largest distance between an occupied cluster site and the substrate , 3 .   at each step down the spin can flip i.e. , change its  @xmath6  ; the  up  direction has a probability @xmath0 ; 4 .",
    "the spin goes down flipping until it reaches a site perimeter of the cluster at which time the local gain in the ising energy + @xmath7 + is calculated .",
    "the fall velocity is irrelevant and there is no backscattering .",
    "if the gain is negative the spin sticks to the cluster immediately ( sticking probability = 1.0 ) and one goes back to step ( [ item : step2 ] ) . in the opposite case the spin sticks to the cluster with a rate @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the local gain in the ising energy . if the spin does not stick to the cluster it continues going down",
    "of course if the site just below the spin is occupied the spin immediately stops and sticks to the cluster .",
    "after the spin stops one goes back to step ( [ item : step2 ] ) .    in the @xmath3-mbd",
    "model@xcite a finite field @xmath10 and @xmath11 were assumed ; in the present report we take @xmath12 but enlarge the permissible values of @xmath0 to @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "all results reported below are for a triangular lattice of horizontal size @xmath14 , when the pile made of clusters has reached a @xmath15 lattice unit height , and after averaging over @xmath16 simulations .",
    "the substrate consists of spins with random direction .",
    "we define the density of a cluster as @xmath17 in which obviously the number of lattice sites in the denominator = 10 000 .",
    "fig.[fig : density3d ] illustrates the behavior of the density with respect to the @xmath0 and @xmath18 parameters .",
    "this figure convinces us that the results are symmetrical with respect to @xmath11 . in the @xmath3-mbd model",
    "the density varies between @xmath19 and @xmath20 but in the present @xmath0-mbd a spread in density occurs ,  from almost a completely compact pile in the af case and large @xmath0 to a loosely packed pile in the f case .",
    "the lowest density ( 0.38 ) occurs for @xmath21 = 0 and for border values of @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath22 and @xmath23 , in the f - case . for strong enough positive interactions ( @xmath24 ) the density saturates toward the value @xmath25 , in the f - case . in the af case , the density varies between 0.38 and 1.0 .",
    "the dependence of the magnetization defined as    @xmath26    is shown in fig.[fig : magnetization ] as a function of @xmath18 and @xmath0 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the number of up and down spins respectively , i.e. @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 can be considered as a measure of the difference in grain orientations in the final packing .",
    "the magnetization appears to be the same in the regions @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( see fig.[fig : magnetization ] ) .",
    "notice that there is no terrace observed here in contrast to the @xmath3-mbd model case @xcite .",
    "define an up - spin percolating cluster as a cluster of up spins which extents from the bottom to the top of the sample . at fixed @xmath0 and @xmath18 the fraction @xmath33 of piles consisting in such a percolating cluster of up spins was computed .",
    "the behavior of @xmath33 with respect to @xmath0 for several values of the @xmath18 parameter is shown in fig.[fig : percolation2d ] .",
    "there is no percolating cluster for @xmath34 in the f - case and 0.85 in the af - case .",

    "above @xmath35 when @xmath33 becomes finite a very fast growth of @xmath33 is observed , at a given @xmath38 .",
    "the differences between af and f are understood if one recalls that the density in the af case is much more sensitive to a change in @xmath0 than in the f case , for which a change of @xmath0 induces only a very small variation of the density  recall that the density in this case is @xmath39 $ ] . on the other hand a similar variation in @xmath0 values generates piles with a wide interval of densities in the af case .",
    "the number of clusters with @xmath40 size is called @xmath41 .",
    "its behavior is shown in fig.[fig : low ] for low @xmath0 values .",
    "notice that the @xmath41 dependence is approximately a straight line on a semi - log plot ( all logs are neperian ) , i.e.    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is a constant for a fixed @xmath44 pair and @xmath40 is the cluster size ( mass ) .",
    "observe that the existence of a large cluster is more probable in the f case than in the af case .",
    "this is expected when one recalls that the f case favours neighbors with a similar spin direction during the deposition .    for high @xmath0 values",
    "the @xmath41 dependence stops to be an exponential law and becomes a power law ( see log - log plots on fig.[fig : high ] ) .",
    "let us postulate    @xmath45    in order to find the values of @xmath0 for which the crossover effect occurs , i.e. from an exponential law regime ( elr ) to a power law regime ( plr ) , we have estimated the slopes of the @xmath41 dependencies in both regimes .",
    "it seems that one should distinguish pile growth conditions with respect to @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "analogously to @xmath41 we can define @xmath48 as the number of hole clusters .",
    "unlike the spin clusters there is no difference in @xmath48 dependencies between low and high values of @xmath0 ,  all @xmath48 dependencies seem to follow a power law .",
    "we have presented the extension of the mbd model @xcite in order to find the role of the probability of spin flip during deposition ( or the degree of freedom modification ) in granular downward rain - like flow in 2d .",
    "the generalized model , hereby called @xmath0-mbd , is a nonequilibrium ballistic deposition model with one degree of freedom .",
    "one can imagine that the spins ( grains ) have different shapes and @xmath0 can be related to a wind strength such that the grains favour one or another position in order to minimize the pile energy .",
    "we have examined the cluster properties through two order parameters , since two characteristic fields ( @xmath2 and @xmath0 ) are intrinsic to the model .",
    "we have investigated the size , or ",
    "mass  , of the spin clusters created through simulation of the nonequilibrium deposition .",
    "the  quenching  of the degree of freedom on the cluster leads to two different regions of spin cluster geometric properties . in the low",
    " @xmath0 region the spin cluster mass distribution follows an exponential law , while in the high @xmath0 region the distribution is characterized by a power law .",
    "the transition between these two regimes is not sharp .",
    "the exponential law regime for high strength of interactions ( i.e. @xmath49 ) seems to be universal , i.e. independent on the magnitude of the intrinsic parameters but depends only on the sign of @xmath18 , i.e. the characteristic contact interaction potential ,  if they are ferromagnetic - like or antiferromagnetic - like , mechanically repulsive or attractive ."
