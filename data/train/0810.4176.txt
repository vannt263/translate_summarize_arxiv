    "the study of top - quark properties and dynamics provides a unique window to the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "the large mass of the top quark suggests that it plays a special role in ewsb , and that new physics connected to ewsb may be found first through precision studies of top - quark observables .",
    "deviations of experimental measurements from the sm predictions , including electroweak ( ew ) and qcd corrections , could indicate new non - standard top production or decay mechanisms .",
    "since the top quark immediately decays before it hadronizes or flips its spin , it provides an excellent testing ground for perturbative qcd .",
    "moreover , information about spin correlation and polarization , imprinted by the production process , is preserved , and can be measured in angular distributions of top - decay products , providing another way to search for deviations from the sm expectation .",
    "the precise measurement of the top - quark mass ( @xmath0 ) allows for improved bounds on the mass of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson ( @xmath1 ) , which is presently constrained to be smaller than 185  gev ( @xmath2 c.l . )",
    "measuring precisely the properties of the top quark and studying its dynamics therefore is an important goal at the tevatron run  ii , lhc and ilc . to fully exploit the potential of these colliders for precision top - quark physics",
    ", it is crucial that predictions for top - quark observables are under theoretical control and include higher - order corrections within the sm and beyond . in the following",
    ", i will briefly describe some theory aspects of top - quark physics relevant to the tevatron , lhc and ilc . for detailed reviews of theoretical and experimental results",

    "the total top - pair production cross section ( @xmath4 ) is presently measured at the tevatron   with a relative uncertainty of @xmath5 ( cdf  @xcite(d0  @xcite ) ) ( with @xmath6 ) . while qcd predictions  @xcite and measurements of @xmath4 agree within their respective uncertainties , recent detailed studies  @xcite of the theoretical uncertainties of presently available state - of - the - art qcd calculations show that further theoretical improvements will be necessary in order to match ( or better exceed ) the anticipated future experimental precision , as illustrated in table  [ ttbartheory ] .",
    "for instance at the lhc , the goal is to measure @xmath4 ultimately with a relative uncertainty of @xmath7 .",
    "all presently available qcd predictions for the total cross sections of the strong @xmath8 production processes , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , include the complete fixed - order next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) corrections  @xcite and next - to - leading - logarithmic ( nll ) contributions due to soft gluon radiation at the @xmath3 threshold resummed to all orders  @xcite .",
    "however , as illustrated in table  [ ttbartheory ] and also pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the next - to - next - to - leading - order ( nnlo ) qcd corrections are needed . without having a full nnlo calculation at hand , recent advances aim to extract partial nnlo contributions  @xcite ( labeled nnlo approx . in table",
    "[ ttbartheory ] ) from an expansion of the threshold - resummed results at next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic ( nnll ) accuracy .",
    "the residual theoretical uncertainty of these predictions due to missing higher - order corrections is estimated by varying the renormalization and factorization scales as shown in table  [ ttbartheory ] .",
    "the pdf uncertainty is also provided for two sets of pdfs , mrst2006nnlo  @xcite and cteq6.5 ( or cteq6.6 m )  @xcite . for a complete fixed - order nnlo calculation of @xmath4 one",

    ".theoretical uncertainties of state - of - the - art qcd predictions for @xmath4 at the tevatron ( @xmath271.96 tev ) and the lhc ( with @xmath28 gev ) due to scale dependence and pdf uncertainties .",
    "the total uncertainties have been calculated by adding the scale and pdf uncertainties ( and in case of ref .",
    "@xcite also the kinematic uncertainties ) in quadrature . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ singlettheory ]",
    "the impressively precise top - mass measurement at the tevatron ( @xmath29  @xcite ) and future high - precision measurements at the lhc and the ilc require a theoretically stable mass definition in a suitable renormalization scheme , so that @xmath30 can be related with equally high precision to the @xmath31 or on - shell masses used in global fits to ew precision observables .",
    "higgs - mass bounds that are extracted from such fits strongly depend on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , a change in @xmath0 of 2  gev shifts the central value of @xmath1 by about 15%  @xcite . at the ilc ,",
    "a theoretically stable definition of the top - quark mass has been achieved with the introduction of the threshold mass , which is extracted from a lineshape measurement of @xmath32 at threshold ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "@xmath33 is known at nnlo qcd  @xcite and a theoretically stable extraction of threshold masses with a theoretical uncertainty of @xmath34 gev is possible  @xcite .",
    "the relation between the threshold masses and the @xmath35 mass is known at higher order qcd which enables an extraction of the @xmath35 top - quark mass with comparable precision  @xcite .",
    "while at the ilc a precise top - quark mass can be obtained from a measurement where only color singlet @xmath3 events need to be counted , the current precise measurement of @xmath0 at the tevatron relies on the reconstruction of the invariant mass of a single top quark .",
    "this reconstructed mass is usually identified with the pole mass which is used in global ew fits .",
    "it is not obvious , if this is justified after non - perturbative effects such as hadronization , color reconnection , and underlying event modeling have been taken into account .",
    "moreover , as has been illustrated in the case of a @xmath0 measurement at the ilc from a @xmath3 threshold scan  @xcite , when including higher - order corrections , the pole mass is not stable , since it receives relatively large radiative corrections from low energy scale physics ( `` renormalon problem '' ) . therefore , it is important to explore alternative methods and observables that are sensitive to @xmath0 such as @xmath36 and the invariant - mass distribution of the top - quark pair ( @xmath37 ) . a value for @xmath0 has been extracted from the @xmath4 measurement at the tevatron with a relative uncertainty of 4%  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the theoretical uncertainties of @xmath0 extracted from @xmath4 at nlo qcd are estimated to be @xmath38 ( lhc ) , @xmath39 ( tevatron ) , and @xmath40 when extracted from the mean of the @xmath37 distribution at nlo qcd at the lhc . at such high precision non - perturbative effects may become important .",
    "for instance , a study of different underlying event modeling at the tevatron with phythia finds @xmath41 gev  @xcite . at the lhc , bound - state and initial - state radiation effects ( both calculated at nlo qcd ) significantly modify @xmath42 at the @xmath8 threshold  @xcite . finally , in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been demonstrated that at least at the ilc the extraction of a top - jet mass @xmath43 from invariant top - mass distributions @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) in the peak region with better than @xmath46 precision seems to be feasible . in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath44 is calculated in the limit @xmath47 at nlo qcd with nll resummation , a theoretically stable mass definition is used ( @xmath43 ) , and a relation between @xmath43 and @xmath31 and threshold masses is derived .",
    "first steps towards a nnlo and nnll prediction of @xmath44 together with a derivation of the relation between @xmath43 and the @xmath31 mass at two - loop order have been carried out recently in ref .",
    "a possible application to a well - defined @xmath0 extraction from invariant top - mass distributions at hadron colliders is presently under investigation  @xcite .",
    "the determination of top - quark properties ( mass , spin , charge ) , searches for signals of non - sm physics , such as anomalous couplings , fcnc , cp and parity - violating interactions , new @xmath3 resonances , and background studies to higgs and new physics searches , require good theoretical control of kinematic distributions in top - quark production and decay .",
    "figure  [ fig : mtttail ] , for instance , illustrates the importance of controlling backgrounds  @xcite and theoretical uncertainties  @xcite in the tail of the @xmath37 distribution in the search of new @xmath3 resonances at the lhc",
    ". for inclusive observables , such as @xmath4 , and @xmath48 distributions , predictions with on - shell top quarks usually are sufficient .",
    "but for the study of spin correlations and polarization asymmetries the top - quark decay needs to be included .",
    "the nlo qcd corrections to @xmath3 production and decay at hadron colliders have been calculated by using the narrow - width approximation including spin correlations between the @xmath49 and @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "asymmetries are especially interesting tools in the search for non - sm physics , since they are usually small in the sm . for instance , within the sm the forward - backward charge asymmetry in @xmath3 production , recently measured at the tevatron  @xcite , is zero at tree - level and small ( @xmath51 )  @xcite when induced by qcd interference effects between initial and final - state gluon radiation . the large theoretical uncertainty ( @xmath52 )  @xcite of this prediction is considerably reduced when nll threshold resummation of soft gluon radiation is taken into account  @xcite . in @xmath53jet production at the tevatron",
    "the nlo qcd corrections reduce the forward - backward charge asymmetry from @xmath54 to @xmath55  @xcite . at the tevatron ,",
    "the impact of non - sm physics , such as tree - level axial couplings of the gluon , can result in charge asymmetries as large as @xmath56  @xcite , for instance .",
    "also parity - violating asymmetries in the production of left and right - handed top quarks have the potential to provide a clean signal of non - sm physics : qcd preserves parity and the sm induced asymmetries are too small to be observable , at least at the tevatron @xmath57 collider  @xcite . the produced top quarks decay almost entirely into a bottom quark and a @xmath58 boson before they can hadronize  @xcite or flip their spins .",
    "the spin correlation of the top - pair system will therefore be preserved and can be measured by studying angular distributions of the decay products  @xcite . to measure spin correlations and asymmetries at the tevatron and the lhc , higher - order corrections to polarized @xmath3 production need to be known as well : the nlo qcd and ew corrections to polarized @xmath3 production",
    "have been calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "the effects of susy qcd and susy ew one - loop corrections to polarized @xmath8 production at hadron colliders have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "they have been found to be promising , but further more realistic studies are needed , including top - quark decays , in order to determine whether these effects will be observable at the lhc .",
    "there has been a lot of activity and many advances in every aspect of accurately predicting and modeling top - quark observables at hadron and @xmath59 colliders of which only a small subset could be presented here .",
    "observables in top - pair and single - top production at hadron colliders are known at nlo qcd and nlo ew both within the sm and the minimal supersymmetric sm , and resummation techniques have been successfully employed to deal with logarithmic enhanced corrections . a complete fixed - order nnlo qcd calculation for @xmath60",
    "is needed and the calculation of many of the necessary building blocks has been completed .",
    "theoretical uncertainties of the available predictions have been studied mostly for inclusive observables ( @xmath61 ) and are under investigation for kinematic distributions .",
    "theoretically stable top - mass definitions are needed to match the experimental precision of @xmath0 measurements at hadron and @xmath62 colliders .",
    "the applicability of new results for a well - defined @xmath0 extraction at the ilc to the lhc is under investigation and the potential of alternative observables for a precise @xmath0 measurements at hadron colliders , such as @xmath63 and @xmath42 , are being studied .",
    "theoretically promising searches of non - sm signals in asymmetries in @xmath3 production , such as the forward - backward charge asymmetry , parity violating asymmetries in polarized @xmath3 production , and spin correlations between the @xmath49 and @xmath64 , require the inclusion of radiative corrections to top production and decay and more detailed and realistic studies of how to disentangle non - sm signals from sm backgrounds , for instance .",
    "these are just a few examples of the theoretical challenges that need to be met in order to fully exploit the potential of the tevatron and the lhc for precision top - quark studies within the sm and beyond .",
