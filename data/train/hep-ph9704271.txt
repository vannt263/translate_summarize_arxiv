    "more than half of the measured baryons in @xmath3 annihilation are directly produced , and even if they are the decay products of primary baryons , unlike most of mesons , they almost conserve the rapidity and the direction of their parents . hence , the properties of the baryon production especially the correlation between baryon(@xmath4 ) and its antibaryon(@xmath5 ) can provide a better probe of the hadronization mechanism .",
    "but even for the data now available , the popular models face some difficulties . for instance , in order to explain the baryon production and the @xmath6 rapidity correlation , the lund string fragmentation model  ( lm ) has to introduce a problematical vacuum excitation of diquark - antidiquark pairs and the popcorn scenario , so that it brings at least 7 free parameters@xmath7 .",
    "even so , it can not reproduce the octet and decuplet baryon multiplicities simultaneously@xmath8 . recently",
    ", opal collaboration find that among all of the popular models , the observed @xmath6 rapidity correlation can only be described by adjusting the @xmath9 popcorn parameter to 95% in lm@xmath10 , but it has no prediction power for the energy dependence of the popcorn parameter and for the probabilities of the @xmath6 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 etc .",
    "configurations .",
    "original quark combination model  ( qcm ) was first proposed by annisovich and bjorken et  al@xmath13 .",
    "it was famous for its simple picture and its successful prediction for the percentage of vector mesons .",
    "one of its great merits is that it treats the baryon and meson production in an uniform scheme , so it describes the baryon production naturally .",
    "but tasso collaboration studied the proton(@xmath14 ) anti - proton(@xmath15 ) phase space correlation at @xmath16 in @xmath0 annihilation early in 1983 .",
    "they found that the prediction of cerny s monte carlo program  ( cmcp ) which was alleged to be based on qcm showed great discrepancies with data@xmath17 . from then on , although qcm is superior to the other models in describing the baryon production , this conclusion that qcm is ruled out by @xmath6 rapidity correlation is always cited in the later literatures@xmath18 , since it is believed that compared with the inclusive properties , the @xmath6 rapidity correlation can provide a more effective criteria to discriminate different models@xmath7 .    in order to investigate whether the contradiction between the tasso data and the prediction of cmcp is really caused by qcm itself , several years ago , we analyzed the @xmath6 phase space correlation from the naive qcm scheme and found that there should not be such an inconsistency qualitatively@xmath19 .",
    "in the meantime , we developed quark production rule  ( qpr ) and quark combination rule  ( qcr ) in the qcm scheme@xmath20 and use them to explain a series of phenomena in @xmath0 annihilation successfully by using much less adjustable parameters .",
    "these phenomena include the multiplicities of various hadrons , the energy dependence of @xmath21 ratio , the multiplicity distribution , the so - called spin suppression for baryons , high multiplicity of singlet baryons and @xmath6 flavor correlations etc@xmath22 .    in this paper , we study the @xmath6 rapidity correlation by qcm in detail , and discuss some related properties . in order to compare the predictions of qcm with data and with those of other models more properly , we implant qcm in jetset monte carlo generator to describe the hadronization",
    ". then we use this modified jetset generator to study the @xmath6 correlation .",
    "we find that the @xmath23 phase space correlation at @xmath24 is in agreement with data .",
    "thus the evidence to exclude qcm which has long been cited in literatures does not exist .",
    "in particular , opal collaboration recently presented high statistics measurements for @xmath25 rapidity correlation at 91  gev and precisely compared their data with the popular models including lm , webber cluster fragmentation model  ( wm ) and ucla model@xmath10 .",
    "we also give the prediction for @xmath25 rapidity correlation and find that our predictions agree with the opal data quite well .",
    "we find that the @xmath6 correlation is insensitive to inclusive quantities as was expected .",
    "additionally , we give prediction for some @xmath21 ratios , multiplicities of some strange baryons , the differential cross sections of the related baryons and the local baryon number compensations .    this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ ii ] , we discuss the monte carlo implementation of qcm , give a brief description of qpr and qcr , and list the relevant formula . in section  [ iii ] , we give the predictions of @xmath23 ( at @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 ( at 91 gev ) rapidity correlation , the differential cross sections of the related baryons and other results .",
    "finally , in section  [ iv ] , we make a conclusive remarks .",
    "in order to compare the available data with the predictions of a hadronization model appropriately , a complete @xmath28 generator is needed .",
    "it should contain the following four phases :    \\1 .",
    "@xmath29 , i.e. @xmath0 pair converts into a primary quark pair @xmath30 via virtual photon or @xmath31 .",
    "this phase is described by the electro - weak theory .",
    "perturbative phase .",
    "it describes the radiation of gluons off the primary quarks , and the subsequent parton cascade due to gluon splitting into quarks and gluons , and the gluon radiation of secondary quarks .",
    "it is believed that perturbative qcd can describe this phase quantatively .",
    "we may use the parton shower(ps ) approach , such as ps model in jetset ( or in herwig ) and color dipole model etc . to describe this phase .",
    "though each of them has different evolution parameters , all of them are based on ap equation , so the results obtained by different ps models should be similar . in this paper",
    ", we use the ps model in jetset .",
    "\\3 . hadronization phase . up to now",
    ", this phase can only be described by phenomenological models , such as lm , wm , ucla model and qcm etc .",
    "unstable hadron decays .",
    "the descriptions of this phase in jetset or herwig are quite similar except some c , b hadrons .",
    "as is usually done , the monte carlo implementation of different hadronization models can be embedded in the same generator provided that the corresponding interface is correctly connected .",
    "for instance , one can use either lm or independent fragmentation model to describe the hadronization phase in jetset .",
    "another example is that buchman et al .",
    "replaced lm with ucla model in jetset@xmath32 .",
    "they use this modified program to reproduce the multiplicities of various hadrons quite well . in our work , we substitute qcm for lm in jetset to describe the hadronization process . for the sake of comparison with lm ,",
    "ucla and other models , we keep other three parts of jetset 7.3 unchanged and use the default values for all of the parameters emerged therein .",
    "so we can investigate the impact of different hadronization models on @xmath6 correlation , the baryon number compensation , the @xmath21 ratio , multiplicities of strange baryons independently .    in the following , we first recall qpr and qcr for a color singlet system , then simply use the longitudinal phase space approximation  ( lpsa ) to get the momentum distribution for primary hadrons in its own system .",
    "finally we extend this hadronization scheme to multi - parton states , and connect it with the perturbative phase in jetset 7.3 .      as was mentioned in section  [ i ] , qpr and qcr",
    "have successfully explained a set of phenomena in @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "here we briefly introduce them and list the relevant equations  ( for detail , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in a color singlet system formed by @xmath30 , @xmath33 pairs of quarks can be produced by vacuum excitation via strong interaction .",
    "we assume that @xmath33 satisfies poisson distribution : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the average number of those quark pairs . according to qpr",
    ", @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the invariant mass of the system , @xmath38 is a free parameter , @xmath39 is the average mass of newborn quarks , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the masses of endpoint quark and anti - quark .",
    "thus we have @xmath33 pairs of quarks according to eqs .",
    "( [ fir ] ) ,  ( [ fir1 ] ) ( containing one primary quark pair ) .",
    "when describing how quarks and antiquarks form hadrons , we find that all kinds of hadronization models satisfy the near correlation in rapidity more or less .",
    "since there is no deep understanding of the significance and the role of this , the near rapidity correlation has not been used sufficiently . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have shown that the nearest correlation in rapidity is in agreement with the fundamental requirements of qcd , and determines qcr completely .",
    "the rule guarantees that the combination of quarks across more than two rapidity gaps never emerges and that @xmath33 quarks and @xmath33 antiquarks are exactly exhausted without forming baryonium @xmath42 and other things .",
    "considering that the quarks and antiquarks are stochastically arranged in rapidity space , each order can occur with the same probability .",
    "then the probability distribution for @xmath33 quarks and @xmath33 antiquarks to combine into @xmath43 mesons , @xmath4 baryons and @xmath4 anti - baryons according to qcr is given by @xmath44 the average numbers of primary mesons @xmath45 and baryons @xmath46 are @xmath47 approximately , in the combination for @xmath48 , @xmath45 and baryons @xmath46 can be well parameterized as linear functions of quark number @xmath33 , @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 . but for @xmath52 , one has @xmath53 so that , the production ratio of baryon to meson is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ w2 ] ) and ( [ w3 ] ) @xmath54 from above , we see that qcm treats meson and baryon formation uniformly , and there is no extra @xmath9 mechanism and free parameters for the baryon production . here",
    "the @xmath21 ratio is completely determined at a certain @xmath33 , unlike in lm that it is completely uncertain and has to be adjusted by a free parameter  ( the ratio of diquark to quark @xmath55 ) .      in order to give the momentum distribution of primary hadrons ,",
    "each phenomenological model must have some inputs .",
    "for example , in lm , they use a symmetric longitudinal fragmentation function @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are two free parameters ( and @xmath57 is flavor dependent ) . in this paper , in order to give the momentum distribution of primary hadrons produced according to qpr and qcr , we simply adopt the widely used lpsa which is equivalent to the constant distribution of rapidity .",
    "hence a primary hadron @xmath59 is uniformly distributed in rapidity axis , then its rapidity can be written as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a random number ; @xmath62 and @xmath63 are two arguments , and can be determined by energy - momentum conservation in such color singlet system @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 denote the energy and the longitudinal momentum of the @xmath59th primary hadron respectively , they are obtained by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the mass of the @xmath59th primary hadron , and @xmath71 obeys the distribution @xmath72 in this paper , we set @xmath73 .",
    "( [ last ] ) is just what lm uses .",
    "note that lpsa or the constant rapidity distribution is rather naive , but it is convenient for us to study the correlations without introducing many parameters which would make the situation more complicated .      at the end of parton showering ,",
    "a final multi - parton state will start to hadronize . to connect the final multi - parton state with qcm",
    ", we adopt a simple treatment assumed in wm , i.e. before hadronization , each gluon at last splits into a @xmath74 pair , the @xmath75 and @xmath76 carry one half of the gluon momentum , and each of them form a color singlet with their counterpart antiquary and quark in their neighborhood , respectively .",
    "now take the three parton state @xmath77 as an example to illustrate the hadronization of multi - parton state .",
    "denote the 4-momenta for @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 as @xmath81 before hadronization , the gluon splits into a @xmath74 pair and the @xmath75 and @xmath76 carry one half of the gluon momentum , and the @xmath77 system forms two color singlet subsystems @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the invariant masses of the subsystems are @xmath84 as was commonly argued by sjstrand and khoze recently@xmath85 , the confinement effects should lead to a subdivision of the full @xmath30 system into color singlet subsystems with screened interactions between these subsystems @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "hence qcm can be applied independently to each color singlet subsystem , i.e. , we can apply the equations in the former two subsections to each subsystem , and obtain the momentum distribution for the primary hadrons in their own center - of - mass system .",
    "then after lorentz transformation , the momentum distribution of the primary hadrons in laboratory frame is given .",
    "this treatment can be extended to a general multi - parton state .    obviously , when the emitting gluon is soft or collinear with the direction of @xmath78 or @xmath79 , @xmath77 can not be distinguished from @xmath30 and @xmath86 or @xmath87 is too small for hadronization . to avoid these cases , a cut - off mass @xmath88 has to be introduced .",
    "here @xmath88 is a free parameter in perturbative phase .",
    "its value and energy dependence is theoretically uncertain .",
    "the physical assumption is that @xmath88 is independent of energy@xmath89 .",
    "as was mentioned above , to compare the predictions of a hadronization model with data appropriately , a @xmath90 generator is needed .",
    "the predictions of cmcp quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite was not obtained by a complete generator , since at least , it did not include the parton shower process .",
    "so it is necessary to recompare the predictions of qcm and tasso data for @xmath23 rapidity correlation .",
    "recently , opal collaboration have compared the observed @xmath25 rapidity correlation with predictions of different hadronization models including lm , ucla and wm by running the corresponding generators .",
    "note that both lm and ucla are embedded in jetset . in order to compare with lm , ucla and other models conveniently",
    ", we also replace lm with qcm in jetset 7.3 . in this section , using this modified jetset , we give our predictions of @xmath91 rapidity correlation and other related properties , and compare them with the corresponding data .",
    "all of our results in this paper are obtained by adjusting only three energy independent parameters , i.e. , the @xmath88 in the perturbative phase , the @xmath38 in qpr and a spin suppression factor @xmath92 for decuplet baryon to octet one .      by choosing @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95",
    ", we can describe most of the hadron yields .",
    "the predictions for them in this paper are similar to that in ref .",
    "@xcite , so we will not discuss them in detail here .",
    "opal collaboration have studied the strange baryon production .",
    "they find that even by adjusting the parameters which are related to the baryon production , jetset  ( lm ) and herwig(wm ) can not fit all the data well@xmath8 .",
    "see table  [ yields ] for their results .",
    "we also list our predictions in the same table .",
    "one can see that our results are better than those of lm and wm . according to the opal studies ,",
    "the baryon yields is not sensitive to the popcorn parameter , and it is only responsible for the @xmath6 rapidity correlations .    in @xmath3 annihilation , because final hadrons observed in experiments come from primary ones which are all hadronization results , the multiplicity ratio of primary baryons to mesons , known as the @xmath21 ratio is essential for understanding the universality of the hadronization mechanism . in lm",
    ", the @xmath21 ratio is additionally adjusted by a free parameter @xmath55 . while in qcm , as is clearly shown in eq .",
    "( [ w5 ] ) , it is completely determined .",
    "so the predictions of the @xmath21 ratios are challenging for qcm . in table",
    "[ y ] , our predictions and the available data@xmath96 at @xmath97 are listed .",
    "it shows the agreement is surprisingly good .    before studying the @xmath6 rapidity correlation",
    ", we should study the momentum distribution for the corresponding baryon .",
    "since almost 70% of tasso data for @xmath23 correlations come from 34  gev , we only give the differential cross section @xmath98 of @xmath99 at this energy  ( see fig.1a ) . to our surprise , with such a simple lpsa input , the prediction of qcm for the momentum distribution agrees with data in the region @xmath100  gev / c .",
    "but at 91  gev , the observed differential cross section of @xmath101 is found to be softer than any predictions of the jetset  ( lm ) , herwig  ( wm ) and qcm .",
    "particularly our prediction is even harder than lm  ( fig.1b ) .",
    "it certainly shows that the lpsa what we used is too naive to simulate the longitudinal distribution thoroughly .",
    "the contradiction between tasso data for @xmath23 rapidity correlation and the prediction of cmcp is always regarded as an evidence to rule out qcm . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that qcm could be qualitatively consistent with data . but to compare with data quantitatively , the experimental conditions and multi - parton states must be taken into account . in this paper , we use the modified jetset in which qcm is embedded to restudy the @xmath23 phase space correlation under the same conditions as in the tasso experiment  ( the measurement is made for the proton with momenta between 0.4 and 1.2  gev / c ) .",
    "our results are shown in fig.2a , b .",
    "one can see that our predictions do agree with data .",
    "the predictions of lm , meyer model  ( mm ) and cmcp are also shown in fig.2a , b . both lm and mm agree with data , too , while cmcp contradicts with data sharply .",
    "note that our predictions seem to be the best for such low statistics data .",
    "because of the limited statistics for the @xmath23 correlation , tasso data can not provide a high discriminating power among different models .",
    "fortunately , opal collaboration recently present the high statistics data for the @xmath102 rapidity correlation at 91  gev@xmath10 .",
    "they compare their data with the predictions of lm , wm and ucla .",
    "they find that the observed rapidity correlation strength  ( rcs ) is found in an interval of @xmath103 around @xmath101 rapidity if the baryon number of a @xmath101 is compensated by a @xmath104 .",
    "] is weaker than that predicted by herwig and jetset(lm ) and stronger than that by the ucla model .",
    "the @xmath25 rapidity correlation can only be described by jetset(lm ) with the popcorn parameter ( @xmath105 ) adjusted to a rather high probability  ( 95% popcorn)(fig.3a ) .",
    "this indicates that baryons appear from the successive production of several quark pairs in the popcorn scenario rather than that only @xmath6 can emerge in the pure diquark model .",
    "since part of time , the end result of the popcorn scenario will be exactly the @xmath6 situation ; however , further possibilities of the type @xmath11 , @xmath12 , etc .",
    "are possible by color fluctuation , i.e. , a number of mesons are produced between @xmath4 and @xmath106 .",
    "these configurations can be described naturally in qcm . in this sense",
    ", qcm is close to the popcorn scenario , and it should obtain the similar @xmath6 rapidity correlation .",
    "our study does show this . in fig.3b ,",
    "our prediction for the @xmath25 rapidity correlation is given .",
    "the corresponding rcs is 53.4% , which is in agreement with the opal measurement @xmath107 .",
    "hence , without the popcorn and the diquark mechanism and any specific parameters , qcm does predict the @xmath25 rapidity correlation well .",
    "we also find that @xmath6 rapidity correlation is not sensitive to the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath38 .",
    "first , we fix @xmath108  ( the same value as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and change @xmath88 in a reasonable range ; then we fix @xmath93 and change @xmath38 .",
    "the predictions for @xmath109 and rcs at 91 gev are listed in table  [ rcs1 ] .",
    "we find that our predictions for @xmath25 rapidity correlation is consistent with data even if the hadron multiplicities vary .",
    "this support a common belief that the @xmath6 rapidity correlation is more sensitive to the underlying fragmentation mechanisms than the inclusive properties .",
    "the petra and pep experiments at @xmath24 could demonstrate that the baryon number is dominantly conserved within the same hemisphere@xmath110 , which is called the local baryon number compensation .",
    "it is regarded as one consequence of chain - like models .",
    "but we find that it can also be explained by qcm naturally . in table",
    "[ table ] , we list our predictions of @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath23 pairs for proton  ( or anti - proton ) momenta between 1 and 5  gev / c in the same(s ) or different hemisphere(d ) at @xmath113gev together with tasso data@xmath114 .",
    "our predictions are normalized to tasso data .",
    "one can see that they are in agreement with data . at @xmath115",
    ", we calculate the ratio @xmath116 ( for j , l = s , d and i , k=@xmath117(@xmath118 ) , @xmath25 ) .",
    "our predictions for @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 are 10.1% , 15.6% , 61.1% and 13.2% , respectively .",
    "they indicate that the baryon number tends to be conserved within the same hemisphere .",
    "these results can easily be understood from qcm . before the hadronization of a multi - parton state , a number of color singlet subsystems emerge .",
    "each of them hadronizes independently .",
    "according to the quark random combination picture , in the center - of - mass frame of each subsystem , baryons and anti - baryons must be produced in pairs and are distributed randomly in this subsystem , so the baryon number is compensated globally in it .",
    "this is just the case obtained by cmcp@xmath123 , since it only considered the hadronization of @xmath30 state . but",
    "each subsystem is one part of the whole system for the multi - parton state . in its center - of - mass frame ,",
    "the baryon and anti - baryon produced in the same subsystem are generally much closer in phase space than those in different subsystems .",
    "thus some local baryon number compensation can be obtained .",
    "in this paper , we use the ps program in jetset to describe the parton shower process and to obtain the final multi - parton state via adjusting @xmath88 . before hadronization ,",
    "the multi - parton state splits into a number of color singlet subsystems . in each subsystem , we use qpr and qcr to describe the hadronization process , and give the momentum distribution of primary hadrons under lpsa .",
    "the unstable hadron decays are handled by the corresponding simulation in jetset . since we only modify the program which describes the hadronization phase , the global properties determined by other phases are the same as that given by the original jetset 7.3 .    in describing meson production ,",
    "qcm and lm are at the same level in respect of reproducing data and the number of adjustable parameters . but",
    "as was mentioned above , for the popular models , the trouble is to describe the baryon production , an aspect which more directly reflects the hadronization mechanism .",
    "they have to introduce additional mechanisms and corresponding parameters to describe the properties related to the baryon production .",
    "for instance , in lm , the @xmath21 ratio depends on the diquark production and the free parameter @xmath55 involved therein .",
    "the @xmath6 rapidity correlation is described by introducing the popcorn scenario and adjusting the free parameter @xmath124 .",
    "the local baryon number compensation depends on the chain - like picture .",
    "the strange baryon yields should be adjusted by other additional parameters , even so , the octet and decuplet can not agree with data simultaneously . in ucla model",
    ", hadron yields can be reproduced well mainly by 5 parameters , but it can not reproduce the @xmath6 rapidity correlation well .",
    "herwig fails at both aspects though it reproduces global properties as well as jetset .    though qcm can describe baryon production naturally , it is still a critical problem whether qcm can reproduce the @xmath6 short range correlation . in section  [ iii ] ,",
    "our results show qcm not only explain the @xmath6 short range rapidity correlation , but also give other properties that agree with data . here , the @xmath6 rapidity correlation , the @xmath21 ratio and the local baryon number compensation are directly determined by the multi - parton state rather than by additional specific mechanisms and associated free parameters . in qcm , these properties are related to the average number @xmath35 of quark pairs in each color singlet subsystem which is controlled by @xmath88 and @xmath38 .",
    "when @xmath35 decreases , the @xmath21 ratio will be smaller , the rcs become stronger , and the local baryon number compensation appears more obvious .",
    "this reveals that these phenomena that seem to have no relations result from a common origin which is directly connected with the multi - parton state before hadronization .",
    "therefore we conclude that qcm not only can not be ruled out by @xmath6 correlations , but also provides a good understanding for them .",
    "this indicates that qcm seems to be a very promising picture for hadronization .",
