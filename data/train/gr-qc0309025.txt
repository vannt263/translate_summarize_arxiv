    "in this context one might imagine  the view from above \" to refer to the vantage point of the extra dimensions of spacetime somewhere  up there \" above us , as in the fiber bundle diagrams one often sees in discussions of higher dimensional theories .",
    "however , in using this phrase here i have in mind something quite different .",
    "no matter how many extra dimensions we consider for spacetime , they all live in a 2-dimensional world of paper , blackboards , computer screens , overhead transparencies , @xmath0  in fact an incredible quantity of 2-dimensional space has been filled with discussions of these higher dimensional models .",
    "it is often easier to keep grinding out the next small step in this production line , but sometimes one has to step back and take a more global look at the situation , to rise up above this 2-dimensional detail ( in our 3-dimensional world ) and think about broader questions .",
    "how do things fit together ?",
    "are there properties which are general for the many special cases considered ?",
    "what properties of these special cases will continue to have validity in a more general setting ?    in these brief remarks",
    "i can not say many things which deserve being said .",
    "being somewhat of an outsider in the field , i must also be careful not to say things which reveal my own ignorance of and lack of familiarity with much of the current work in higher dimensional models .",
    "having recently studied some properties of classical symmetric cosmological models in higher dimensions,@xmath1 this invited talk pushed me to try to make some sense of some of the details scattered in the literature .",
    "since time has been short , i can not explain exactly how everything fits together , but i hope to convey a general picture which if pursued may put many of these results into perspective . in so doing i would suggest that perhaps a little more attention should be paid to how specific calculations fit into the larger scheme of things . certainly it is much more satisfying when many little things fit together as particular cases of a single bigger thing .",
    "this idea characterizes present day theoretical physics and the importance it gives to unifying symmetries .",
    "unfortunately the search for exact solutions of 4-dimensional gravitational theories has more often than not focused on special cases without putting them into perspective . in higher dimensions",
    "there is much more room to play games .",
    "i think the situation demands some restraint .",
    "some effort should be made toward ",
    "looking at the forest rather than the trees . \"",
    "the game of looking for exact or even qualitative solutions of gravitational field equations all too often finds itself at the tree level when an aerial view of the forest is really what is needed .",
    "unification of the fundamental forces has led people to adopt the kaluza - klein idea@xmath2 of formulating theories on higher dimensional spacetimes . at first",
    "the extra dimensions were introduced as a mathematical device for obtaining dimensionally reduced unified theories on 4-dimensional spacetime .",
    "these additional dimensions , tied to symmetries of the spacetime , allowed the collapse of the theory to an equivalent 4-dimensional one .",
    "eventually ideas progressed to the point where the extra dimensions were taken seriously .",
    "the  fiber \" symmetry of these fiber bundle formulations of 4-dimensional theories was abandoned and such theories became truly higher dimensional ones.@xmath3    this immediately created a problem . if the fundamental theory of matter is really higher dimensional in such a nontrivial way , one must explain the present effective 4-dimensional spacetime and the apparently 4-dimensional theory which describes nature . some mechanism is required to collapse the additional dimensions to a point where they are not observable . this could be accomplished if they are associated with spatially compact dimensions with very small circumferences , but one needs some way for this  compactification \" to be a natural consequence of the theory itself .",
    "an interesting possibility for this compactification mechanism is the dynamical behavior of the gravitational field itself within these theories .",
    "the present 4-dimensional phase of the universe is very anisotropic , given the necessarily large difference in length scales associated with the  ordinary \" and  extra \" dimensions .",
    "chodos and detweiler@xmath4 first suggested this anisotropy might be a consequence of the evolution of the gravitational field . examining purely gravitational 5-dimensional theories with flat homogeneous space sections characterized entirely by  free \" anisotropic",
    "expansion,@xmath5 they noted that classical cosmological solutions are _ allowed _ in which preferential expansion of three spatial directions occurs .",
    "however , such solutions are not _ selected _ by the theory .",
    "one needs matter fields to obtain such a selection effect.@xmath6 such fields may be added in ordinary kaluza - klein theories , while supersymmetry dictates what matter fields exist in locally supersymmetric theories ( supergravity , superstrings).@xmath7    with this in mind classical solutions of the bose sector of higher dimensional theories have been studied to throw some light on the nature of the ground state of such theories .",
    "such studies fall into two categories , characterized by the behavior of the gravitational field . in the first",
    ", solutions are considered in which the spacetime is the product of two static symmetric component manifolds representing the ordinary spacetime and the internal spaces , the discussion being more particle physics in flavor ( e.g. , reference 13 ) . in the second ,",
    "evolving models are considered , typically from the viewpoint of a relativist somewhat less concerned with the particle physics motivation for considering such models .    as a classical relativist",
    "i wish to address the second kind of investigation in the spirit of freund,@xmath6 demaret et al@xmath8 and others.@xmath9 many particular exact or qualitative cosmological solutions of various higher dimensional theories have been discussed .",
    "although only for very special conditions can one obtain closed form solutions , such solutions may describe a single isolated dynamical effect of the full equations which when accompanied by other degrees of freedom no longer allows exact solutions but perhaps exhibits a similar qualitative behavior , or at least one which can be understood in the context of the coupled behavior .",
    "properties exhibited by special solutions are probably only interesting to the extent that they relate to the general case in this way .",
    "certain exact solutions in fact exhibit a  typical behavior \" during certain phases of the evolution .",
    "such solutions can be understood in terms of additional properties related to a qualitative formulation of the field equations . from a purely mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "the existence of closed form exact solutions often is accompanied by underlying properties of the differential equations that are rarely understood in first obtaining them and which help to relate various particular solutions to each other .",
    "understanding how exact solutions fit into a bigger picture is perhaps more important than any particular exact solution found by chance or  cleverness \" .",
    "these ideas are also useful in understanding the idea of  gravitational chaos \" both in the general cosmological context and in the context of the homogeneous models.@xmath10 this question is studied as a purely gravitational phenomenon relevant to the classical initial singularity independent of particle theory questions . although quantum effects at the planck length probably make the question irrelevant , it is an interesting mathematical problem",
    ".    limitations of time and space permit only a hint of a more global point of view illustrated by a few key examples .",
    "hopefully such a discussion , necessarily abbreviated , can still be valuable in establishing the importance of such a point of view for this branch of cosmology .",

    "if @xmath17 is an invariant subgroup , @xmath16 is a group and hence this occurs as a special case of the simply transitive case for which additional symmetry exists ; the case where @xmath17 is not invariant will be referred to as nontrivial .    in either case",

    "since we wish to focus on the gravitational properties of higher dimensional models , we consider the einstein equations with all other fields lumped into the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this assumes that the gravitational part of the classical field equations can be represented in this way , thus excluding  higher derivative \" theories .",

    "however , for dynamical solutions a compromise is preferable , namely the ricci evolution equations @xmath52 , supplemented by the einstein constraints rather than more equations involving second time derivatives .    to understand the usefulness of this compromise for spatially homogeneous solutions , it is convenient to introduce the hamiltonian formulation .",

    "these are discussed by lorentz.@xmath156 all of these are disguised versions of the taub family of solutions which represents the dynamics of one or two nontrivial gravitational degrees of freedom , independent of the dimension .",
    "this variation of parameter idea is not special to @xmath154 supergravity in the higher dimensional context , but as already mentioned above , has implications for other theories as well .",
    "consider the general case of a decomposable spatial metric from the point of view of the ricci evolution equations @xmath198 here @xmath199 and @xmath200 are the ricci tensor mixed component matrices of the individual homogeneous metrics on the factor manifolds @xmath201 and @xmath202 ; the source energy - momentum must also be in block diagonal form for consistency with the einstein equations .",
    "the ricci evolution equations are @xmath203 and in taub time gauge @xmath204 @xmath205 in the diagonal case @xmath206 , the time derivative term is simply @xmath207 .",
    "the only coupling between @xmath208 and @xmath209 in this time gauge occurs through the factor @xmath210 in the driving term .",
    "when @xmath211 , for example , @xmath209 has free dynamics and one can rescale @xmath208 by a power of @xmath212 to decouple the remaining evolution equations from @xmath212 @xmath213 this redefinition of variables leads to the taub time ricci evolution equations for the spacetime @xmath214 with spatial metric matrix @xmath215 . the conserved energy associated with those equations , however ,",
    "must be nonzero due to the contribution of the free motion in the extra dimensions to the higher dimensional energy .",
    "this was noted by barrow and stein - schabes for a @xmath153 kaluza - klein generalization of the bianchi type ix models , for which generalized taub solutions were mentioned.@xmath216    when the spatial metric is not decomposable , but still has the block diagonal form ( 4.17 ) , a number of decoupling possibilities occur depending on the form of the driving term .",
    "suppose that @xmath209 is the 1-dimensional matrix @xmath217 so @xmath218 .",
    "then the gauge @xmath219 leads to @xmath220 ; if @xmath221 is independent of @xmath222 , then @xmath208 immediately decouples from @xmath222 , while @xmath223 satisfies a linear equation with a @xmath208 dependent source . when the trace of @xmath224 depends only on @xmath225 , taking the trace of the first block of the ricci evolution equations leads to a decoupled equation for @xmath225 , the kinetic term reducing to @xmath226 .",
    "if @xmath227 is a constant , say @xmath228 , this equation is in fact @xmath229 , leading to exponential or hyperbolic solutions when @xmath230 , trigonometric solutions when @xmath231 and linear solutions when @xmath232 .",
    "( this is again the 1-dimensional scattering problem , this time in the variable @xmath233 . )",
    "this situation occurs , for example , if the spatial section is the semidirect product of a @xmath234-dimensional abelian subgroup and a 1-dimensional group of automorphisms of that subgroup , the 1-dimensional group being associated with the @xmath18th direction .",
    "the block diagonal (  symmetric case \" ) @xmath235 nonsemisimple models are of this type , and this feature allows a uniform treatment in the time gauge @xmath236 of most of the known vacuum solutions of this class , which are related by variation of parameters to scalar field ( and hence higher dimensional kaluza - klein ) , stiff perfect fluid ( including tilt along the distinguished direction ) and spatially self - similar generalizations.@xmath119 some solutions of the evolution equations , not allowed by the original super - hamiltonian constraint , may satisfy that constraint after a variation of parameters , leading to solutions with no analog in the original case .",
    "such solutions occur when a certain parameter changes sign .",
    "for @xmath225 to decouple , it is sufficient that @xmath237 depend only on @xmath225 .",
    "this occurs if this term arises from a curvature term associated with an isotropic coset space factor manifold to which the @xmath18th direction belongs .",
    "friedmann - robertson - walker or kantowski - sachs factors or even semisimple taub factors lead to this behavior . in the @xmath235 semisimple taub case ,",
    "the group manifold @xmath238 , as an @xmath44 fiber bundle over @xmath239,@xmath240 is locally a product , hence choosing @xmath241 ( i.e. , @xmath242 ) , where @xmath126 is associated with the isotropic @xmath239 base of the fiber bundle , leads to a decoupled equation for @xmath243 .",
    "one may also rescale the lapse by a power of @xmath225 without loosing this decoupling ( i.e. , @xmath244 ) .",
    "for example , in the taub case , the lapse @xmath245 leads to the @xmath134 decoupling of @xmath225 , yielding quadratic solutions .",
    "these ideas were used by lorentz - petzold ( without being fully understood ) in his discussion of some supergravity solutions@xmath156 and brans - dicke solutions.@xmath246 the latter are equivalent to a @xmath153 kaluza - klein model in the vacuum case , and his choice of decoupling variable ",
    "@xmath97 \" involving the scalar field is exactly the variable @xmath225 in the higher dimensional formulation . adding perfect fluids with certain equations of state leads to a variation of parameters in the evolution equations without breaking this decoupling .",
    "all exact solutions can be understood in terms of the variation of parameters idea .",
    "another situation arises when the lapse depends only on @xmath97 , say @xmath247 so @xmath248 .",
    "the trace of the ricci evolution equations then gives a decoupled equation for @xmath225 as long as @xmath249 is a constant , say @xmath228 ; the equation is then @xmath250 , again having the same solutions as discussed above depending on the signs of @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "for example , in the @xmath102 case , a bianchi type i perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath253 has @xmath254 and hence @xmath255 makes @xmath256 constant ; a cosmological constant alone has @xmath257 constant , so in this latter case @xmath225 has the same solutions as above but in proper time gauge . on the other hand for the bianchi type i fluid case , one can also choose @xmath258 so that @xmath259 and @xmath260 , which leads to quadratic solutions for @xmath225 ; this was an intermediate step in the work of jacobs.@xmath261    all these exact solutions are characterized by the fact that the source energy - momentum ( including a possible cosmological constant ) may be represented in terms of the metric and constants of the motion , leading to an entirely geometric system .",
    "this occurs only when the source has either discrete or continuous additional symmetry.@xmath262 in this class of models at most two  nontrivial \" gravitational modes can be excited , as in the semisimple taub case , the existence of exact solutions depending at least on a partial decoupling of the modes .",
    "at this point the overview of existing special exact solutions has shown us that they all depend crucially on decoupling ideas that involve the dewitt geometry , the symmetry of the potentials or driving forces , the choice of time variable and the choice of evolution equations .",
    "the variation of parameters idea and its relation to the constraints turns out to be a very important one , sometimes involving the parameters of the solutions of the equations and sometimes the parameters of the equations themselves .",
    "although the super - hamiltonian constraint has been emphasized because of the models discussed here , the supermomentum constraint plays a similar role when models are considered which excite the supermomentum.@xmath119 all of these ideas seem never to be systematically applied .",
    "most special solutions are found almost by accident and never later understood in a broader context .",
    "studying the appropriate sections of the _ exact solutions _",
    "book@xmath263 with these ideas in mind , one begins to see some order in the seemingly unrelated list of exact solutions in ordinary spacetime . in higher dimensions",
    "the situation is similar .    but are particular exact cosmological solutions really significant ?",
    "what do we gain by finding new very special solutions of some particular set of field equations ?",
    "this is a timely question , given that the exact solutions industry often seems to be only weakly coupled to reality .",
    "one might imagine that special solutions might be interesting if they exhibit some  stable \" property of the field equations in some sense or if the solutions exhibit some  typical \" behavior during certain phases of the evolution of the universe , at least within the restricted symmetry class considered if not in a larger context .",
    "for the spatially homogeneous case , ordinary differential equations permit a sophisticated analysis of the qualitative behavior of their solutions.@xmath264 in an appropriate formulation of the field equations , certain special exact solutions play the role of  singular points \" and  separatrixes \" between singular points on an appropriate phase space . in the context of the parameter space of all symmetry types of a given dimension",
    ", exact solutions of a lesser symmetry type often characterize phases of evolution of a higher symmetry type.@xmath265 singular points are associated with  exact power law \" solutions@xmath266 of the field equations , which in turn are geometrically characterized by self - similar evolution , i.e. , the existence of additional spacetime symmetry in the form of a homothetic symmetry which shifts the homogeneous hypersurfaces along the time direction .",
    "this reduces the field equations to algebraic equations in certain parameters which determine the metric completely .",
    "the simplest of these is the kasner solution .",
    "the taub solutions and their generalizations act as separatrixes in this picture .",
    "these kinds of solutions are important in understanding typical behavior at very early times toward the big bang and at very late times coming out of the big bang .",
    "perhaps some of the energy devoted to finding particular exact solutions ( a tree level activity ) should be shifted to understanding some of the broader questions that arise in this area of research .",
    "the average level of  new exact solution \" papers seems to have remained close to the level of two decades ago when this game first drew widespread participation .",
    "as we have seen , those exact solutions which exist are very special and have very nice mathematical properties which relate them to one another due to the richness of the einstein equations .",
    "if these simple ideas are not commonly understood , how can one hope to have reasonable progress on more complicated questions ?",
    "one deeper mathematical question which seems to fascinate many people is the extent to which the  oscillatory approach to the initial singularity \" found in the @xmath102 spatially homogeneous vacuum semisimple case and in the ( nonstiff ) perfect fluid case with anisotropic spatial curvature might be a  general property \" of cosmological solutions of the classical einstein equations.@xmath267 this has aroused considerable controversy , more recently acquiring the trendier name of gravitational chaos@xmath268 and spreading into higher dimensional purely gravitational models.@xmath269    in the @xmath102 semisimple case , the vacuum supermomentum constraints restrict the spatial metric to be diagonalizable , the three spatial gauge degrees of freedom being intimately connected with the remaining three  offdiagonal modes \" which are not excited in vacuum .",
    "( diagonalization depends on the choice of the lie algebra basis ; the killing metric must be diagonal in a basis in which the spatial metric is diagonal . such a frame is then also an eigenbasis of the extrinsic curvature , namely a  kasner frame\"@xmath270 . ) in taub time gauge the spatial curvature potentials at fixed @xmath75 have  essentially closed \" potential contours on the flat subspace of the two @xmath271 variables , and for increasing values of the potential , these contour lines resemble more and more closely straight line contours joined together at vertices which are either closed or have open channels which run out to infinity with a width which goes to zero .",
    "straight \" contours are exponential and move outward with @xmath75-speed @xmath182 as @xmath272 , while the system point moves with unit @xmath75-speed ( a null geodesic ) when the potential is negligible compared to the kinetic energy .",
    "thus the system point continually overtakes and scatters off the receding exponential potentials as long as the relative velocity between the system point in its free state and some exponential potential is always negative ( approach ) .",
    "in fact the geometry is such that the relative velocity between the system point and the exponential potentials which is is chasing is nonpositive in every direction but the vertex directions , where it vanishes .",
    "motion exactly along a vertex direction only occurs for the taub solutions which describe motion down the center of an open channel extending to infinity .",
    "thus in general one has the mixmaster behavior@xmath101 in which the system point rattles around indefinitely within the expanding potential as @xmath272 .",
    "on the other hand the nonsemisimple vacuum models have an open set of directions in which the system point may escape , i.e. , the absence of at least one of the  straight \" potential terms leads to an open set of directions in which the potential asymptotically goes to zero , and the system point eventually ends up in an asymptotic free state .    in the group manifold case , which is more general than the coset space case , each ",
    "straight \" potential contour line is associated with the structure constant component @xmath273 with @xmath274 , which enters as a quadratic factor in the potential.@xmath1 for the @xmath102 semisimple case , all such terms are necessarily present , leading to the essentially closed potential contours . in higher dimensions several crucial differences occur .",
    "one still needs semisimplicity for the existence of essentially closed potential contours ; these potentials are best described in a frame in which the killing metric is diagonal as in the @xmath102 case",
    ". however , the jacobi identity no longer allows all structure constants @xmath273 with distinct indices to be nonzero , removing certain potential terms .",
    "furthermore , only some of the offdiagonal modes are restricted by the supermomentum constraints , so the vacuum case in no longer diagonalizable and certain offdiagonal modes are nontrivial in the sense that the curvature potential necessarily depends on them and they can not be suppressed without additional symmetry imposition , much like that which reduces the mixmaster models to the essentially different taub models .",
    "this leads to the excitation of nonzero curvature modes of the ( rescaled ) dewitt metric . for those models which are diagonalizable and therefore no longer general",
    ", the absence of all possible structure constants with distinct indices apparently leads to a vertex geometry such that an open set of vertex directions exists along which the  free \" system point can chase the potential with positive relative velocity ( recession ) ; the system point then eventually ends up in an asymptotic free state.@xmath275    without imposing the jacobi identity , demaret et al@xmath276 have shown that this happens only for @xmath277 , relevant to the general inhomogeneous case which still remains somewhat controversial .",
    "for the homogeneous case , the jacobi identities seem to reduce the critical dimension to @xmath278 in diagonalizable models .",
    "however , in nondiagonal models , the eigenvectors of the extrinsic curvature no longer coincide with the time independent invariant frame vectors and the transformation to the eigenvector frame induces more nonzero structure functions .",
    "since it is the eigenvector frame ( kasner frame ) structure functions which are relevant to the existence of an asymptotic free state , the question still remains open for those dimensions @xmath279 $ ] for which semisimple groups exist .    of course chaos even in @xmath102 dimensions",
    "is sabotaged by the presence of a scalar field since it contributes a term to the super - hamiltonian which reduces the free motion speed of the system point ( timelike motion ) , therefore allowing an open set of vertex directions ( or eventually all directions ) which permit an asymptotic free state.@xmath280 moreover , since the free motion phases are translations in @xmath281 , one very quickly approaches the initial singularity @xmath98 , slamming into the planck scale where the classical einstein equations break down and the indefinite approach to the classical singularity is no longer particularly relevant .",
    "the classical chaos does lead to quantum consequences , however , at least at the naive level which allows calculation.@xmath282",
    "whether one is interested in mathematical questions or more physical questions , a broader point of view is extremely valuable .",
    "this article has focused on certain mathematical questions as a means of illustrating this point .",
    "staring at equations or their solutions in a 2-dimensional representation is not particularly illuminating .",
    "the rich geometrical structure of the einstein equations allows one instead to exploit ",
    "hidden \" relationships and visualize many concepts which remain somewhat obscure in their brute form representation . even when visualization may be difficult or not particularly relevant , a perspective which views a given problem  from above \" is certainly more effective in not only resolving that problem , but in understanding the result and placing it into context .",
    "the latter is , after all , more important than the former .",
