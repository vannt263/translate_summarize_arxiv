    "the lorentz - noninvariant maxwell  chern  simons ( mcs ) model in four spacetime dimensions has been extensively studied over the last years with suitable interactions added , the model allows for photon triple - splitting ( @xmath1 ) , but the decay width of the photon has only been calculated for one special case @xcite .",
    "another interesting process is vacuum cherenkov radiation , with an electron emitting an mcs photon ( @xmath2 ) , for which there exists an order of magnitude estimate of the decay probability @xcite .    in order to improve our understanding , we consider in the present article simple scalar models where lorentz symmetry is broken by a ( purely ) spacelike background vector , and focus on the effects in decay processes .",
    "we , then , turn to two- and three - particle decays in a modified version of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , which has an anisotropic photonic chern ",
    "simons - like term @xcite added to the standard maxwell  dirac action of qed @xcite .",
    "first , we calculate the vacuum cherenkov radiation of a moving electron ( i.e. , moving with respect to the preferred frame from the chern  simons - like term ) .",
    "second , we obtain the general result for photon triple - splitting in the low - energy effective theory with electrons integrated out ( specifically , the photon model with the euler  heisenberg quartic interaction term added to the quadratic mcs terms ) .",
    "third , we discuss the possible high - energy behavior of the photon - triple - splitting decay width at tree level , which may be compared to the behavior of the exact tree - level result for vacuum cherenkov radiation .",
    "the scope of the present article has been restricted to a relatively simple and well - understood model , as our goal is to perform a _",
    "complete _ calculation of certain two- and three - particle decays , at least at tree level . in the pure photon sector",
    ", there are only two possible bi - linear lorentz - violating terms @xcite , one of which , the @xmath0odd chern  simons - like term , we study in detail .",
    "the other possible term , which is @xmath0even , will be discussed briefly at the end of the article .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : lorentz ] , we present the scalar and photon models considered and introduce the concept of effective mass square . in section [ sec : decay ] , we define the decay width in a lorentz - violating theory and , in section [ sec : scalar ] , study a few simple decay processes for scalars . in section [ sec : cherenkov ] , we give results for cherenkov radiation in modified qed with a spacelike chern ",
    "simons - like term and , in section [ sec : photon ] , for photon triple - splitting in the corresponding low - energy effective theory ( details of the calculation are relegated to the appendices ) . in section [ sec : discussion ] , we place our results in a larger context and speculate on photon triple - splitting from the @xmath0even lorentz - violating term mentioned above .",
    "the present article is rather technical and the reader who is only interested in the main results may skip ahead to sections  [ sec : cherenkov ] and [ sec : photon ] , while referring back to sections  [ sec : lorentz ] and [ sec : decay ] for the necessary definitions .",
    "we work in four - dimensional minkowski spacetime , and postulate translation invariance which implies energy - momentum conservation . the lorentz - symmetry breaking is implemented by the presence of constant background tensors in the action , as in the standard model extension of ref .  @xcite .",
    "we are mainly interested in bi - linear breaking terms which lead to modified dispersion relations and new definitions of the free particle states .",
    "as will be seen later , such modifications are more interesting than having just one particular type of lorentz - violating interaction , since the changed kinematics appears in all kinds of physical processes .    in our examples ,",
    "lorentz invariance is broken by a real background four - vector @xmath3 where we have split @xmath4 into a dimensionless unit vector @xmath5 characterizing the lorentz - breaking direction in spacetime ( normalization @xmath6 ) and a mass scale @xmath7 setting its length .",
    "if @xmath4 is spacelike , there is a preferred spatial direction in coordinate frames with @xmath8 . for timelike @xmath4",
    ", there is rotational invariance in frames with @xmath9 .",
    "we do not consider the `` lightlike '' case ( @xmath10 ) , which can be viewed as being of measure zero .    in the purely spacelike case ( @xmath8 and @xmath11 ) , we will use the following notations : @xmath12 for an arbitrary three - vector @xmath13 . throughout , we employ the minkowski metric @xmath14 , take @xmath15 , and set @xmath16 ( except when stated otherwise ) .",
    "in the main part of this article , we assume that @xmath4 is spacelike and choose a particular coordinate frame so that @xmath4 is purely spacelike .",
    "the calculations are simplified in such a frame ( loosely called the `` purely spacelike frame '' ) , because lorentz invariance with respect to boosts in directions orthogonal to @xmath17 is preserved , together with rotational invariance around @xmath17 . in section",
    "[ sec : lifetime ] , we discuss how to interpret these theories in a general frame .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we start from a noninteracting photon model which results from adding a @xmath0odd abelian chern  simons - like term @xcite to the standard maxwell term @xcite .",
    "the model action is then given by @xmath18 with the following maxwell and chern  simons - like terms : @xmath19 { \\mathcal{s}}_\\text{cs } & = & \\int_{\\mathbb{r}^4 } \\mathrm{d}^4 x \\left(\\,\\frac14\\;\\ , m\\,\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}\\,\\widehat\\zeta^{\\,\\mu}\\,a^\\nu\\ , f^{\\rho\\sigma}\\ , \\right)\\text , \\label{eq : csterm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the gauge field and @xmath21 the field strength .",
    "the action is gauge invariant , provided the field strength vanishes rapidly enough at infinity .",
    "the extra term may , for example , be induced by the @xmath0 anomaly of chiral gauge theories over a topologically nontrivial spacetime manifold @xcite . from astrophysical bounds",
    "@xcite , the mass parameter @xmath22 is known to be very small , at least for the regular photon and the present universe .",
    "the relatively simple model may , however , have other applications and the intention of the present article is purely theoretical .    if the background vector @xmath4 is spacelike , quantization is possible in frames where this vector is purely spacelike @xcite . in these frames ,",
    "the invariance under time reversal @xmath23 is broken , while charge conjugation @xmath24 and parity reflection @xmath25 remain symmetries ; cf . refs .  @xcite . for timelike @xmath4",
    ", a quantization does not appear to be possible @xcite .",
    "the field equations of the model are @xmath26 from a plane - wave _ ansatz _ , one obtains the dispersion relation for the momentum four - vector @xmath27 , @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "this relation gives two different propagation modes , called @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the following , according to the form the dispersion relation takes in a purely spacelike frame , @xmath32 with `` parallel energies '' @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath30 mode has timelike four - momentum and a mass gap .",
    "the @xmath31 mode has spacelike four - momentum and is gapless .",
    "but , even though certain photon momenta can be spacelike , the theory is still causal @xcite . in appendix  [ ap : polarizations ] , we present the modified polarization vectors of the photon , together with certain useful relations . for further details , see , in particular , section  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the lorentz - noninvariant photon model of the previous subsection is already quite complicated and , as a simpler example , we consider a complex scalar field with the following free action : @xmath35 with @xmath22 and @xmath36 taken positive .",
    "a spacetime - dependent phase redefinition of the fields could eliminate the lorentz - violating term in the free model ; cf .",
    "@xcite . here , however , we assume that the interactions considered do not allow these phase redefinitions ( see section  [ sec : scalar ] ) .    in this scalar model , the conventional discrete symmetries @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath23 are broken @xcite .",
    "the combinations @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 are conserved , but not @xmath0 .",
    "the action yields the field equation @xmath40 and the complex - conjugate equation for @xmath41 .",
    "the dispersion relation for the momentum vector @xmath27 is then given by : @xmath42 with the upper sign for @xmath43 and the lower for @xmath41 .",
    "solving the quadratic @xmath44 equation , one has for the positive energy branch , @xmath45 with @xmath46 . for the purely spacelike case",
    ", the energy reduces to @xmath47 with @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "the asymptotic parallel energy of the scalar model has the same structure as the result of the mcs model , apart from the sign of the mass term ( remember that @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath23 are broken in the scalar model , whereas only @xmath23 is broken in the purely spacelike mcs model ) .    for @xmath50 , the group velocity  @xmath51 is less or equal to @xmath52 ; cf .",
    "microcausality ( locality ) can then be verified by a calculation analogous to the lorentz - invariant case .",
    "recall that locality @xcite requires , in particular , a vanishing commutator @xmath53 $ ] for spacelike separation @xmath54 .",
    "the lorentz - violating terms in and have a similar structure : each term is bi - linear in the fields , has a single derivative , and couples to the background vector",
    ". the models also have similar dispersion relations @xmath55 , as long as the scalar mass parameter @xmath36 does not dominate , @xmath56 .",
    "a photon mass term in the mcs model is , of course , forbidden by gauge invariance .",
    "one way to look at modified dispersion relations is to think of the norm square of the energy - momentum four - vector as the `` effective mass square '' of the particle with corresponding three - momentum , @xmath57 this effective mass square is associated with a specific mode and may depend on the coordinate frame used . for timelike momentum , on the one hand , the effective mass square is the energy square in the frame with zero three - momentum . for spacelike momentum , on the other hand ,",
    "the effective mass square is negative and there is no frame with vanishing three - momentum .",
    "the effective mass square of the photon from the purely spacelike mcs model is given by @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "the absolute value of this effective mass square grows with the momentum component in the preferred direction , but is still suppressed relative to the energy square , @xmath60 for @xmath59 .",
    "the effective mass square of the scalar model in the purely spacelike frame is given by @xmath61 with the upper sign for @xmath43 and the lower for @xmath41 .",
    "the ( anti-)scalar effective mass square from eq .   has the same structure as the asymptotic result of the mcs model , apart from the sign of the linear term .    as will be seen later , these effective mass squares appear directly in the transition amplitudes or , at least , determine their strength .",
    "but they even occur in _ free _ theories and might , for example , play a role in lorentz - noninvariant neutrino oscillations due to fermi - point splitting @xcite . in this case ,",
    "the dispersion relation of the neutrino is essentially the same as the one of our scalar model , eq .  .",
    "as the effective mass squares ( and their differences ) increase linearly with energy , the usual energy - dependence of the oscillations is canceled .",
    "the momentum dependence of the effective mass squares might , therefore , play an important role in neutrino oscillations , provided the usual lorentz - invariant masses are small enough .",
    "for the decay of a particle with momentum @xmath62 and dispersion relation @xmath63 into @xmath64 particles with momenta @xmath65 and dispersion relations @xmath66 , the width can be defined as follows @xcite : @xmath67   & & \\times\\ , ( 2\\pi)^4 \\delta^3\\big({{\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{q}}}}- \\sum_j { { \\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{k}}}}_j\\big)\\ , \\delta\\big(\\omega({{\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{q } } } } ) - \\sum_l \\omega_l({{\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{k}}}}_l)\\big ) \\ , { |{a({\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{q } } } , \\omega , { \\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{k}}}_i , \\omega_i)}|}^2\\text,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with symmetry factor @xmath68 for identical decay products and transition amplitude @xmath69 . in this expression , @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    "are normalization factors which , in the lorentz - invariant case , are given by @xmath72 and @xmath73 with corresponding normalization of the amplitude .    we find the following normalization factor for the lorentz - violating scalar model : @xmath74 where the ( upper ) lower sign is for the field ( @xmath43 ) @xmath41 . for the mcs model in the purely spacelike frame , the normalization factor reduces to the usual one , @xmath75 but with @xmath76 given by expression .",
    "the `` decay parameter '' @xmath77 is now defined by @xmath78 in a lorentz - invariant theory , @xmath77 does not depend on the initial three - momentum @xmath79 but only on the masses of the particles involved .",
    "the reason is that the only lorentz invariants available are functions of the masses . in a lorentz - violating theory ,",
    "the decay parameter may also depend on the momentum @xmath62 through contractions of @xmath80 with the background tensors .    in most cases",
    ", it suffices to calculate @xmath77 in a specific frame and to generalize to the coordinate - independent expression",
    ". the calculation will be especially simple for two types of coordinate frames :    1 .",
    "the class of frames with _ vanishing _ three - momentum of the decaying particle , @xmath81 , for the case of timelike four - momentum @xmath80 and arbitrary background vector @xmath4 ; 2 .   the class of frames where the background vector is _ purely _",
    "spacelike or timelike , for the case of a spacelike or timelike background vector @xmath4 .",
    "for example , if the calculation in our models is performed in a frame where @xmath4 is purely spacelike , @xmath77 will be a function of @xmath82 , which has the frame - independent form @xmath83 .",
    "it appears reasonable to demand that , at least in first approximation , the `` lifetime '' of an unstable particle , defined by @xmath84 transforms as a genuine time with respect to changes of frame ( i.e. , as the zero - component of a four - vector ) .",
    "then , the quantity @xmath23 must change as follows :    @xmath85    with @xmath86 the velocity of the particle [ tentatively identified with the group velocity @xmath87 for energy @xmath63 in the old frame ] , @xmath79 and @xmath88 the momenta in the old and new frame , and @xmath89 the boost velocity characterizing the motion of the new frame relative to the old .",
    "equation can be checked explicitly in the models of section  [ sec : lorentz ] , provided the group velocity is used for @xmath86 .    as long as @xmath90",
    ", there always exists a `` rest frame '' with @xmath91 and @xmath92 one can take @xmath93 , the minimum of the lifetimes over all frames , as the definition of the observer - independent lifetime of that specific mode .",
    "this lifetime will then be properly time - dilated in frames where the decaying particle is moving .",
    "for lorentz - invariant theories , the rest - frame decay width can be written as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is simply the mass of the decaying particle . by analogy",
    ", we define the mode - dependent `` quasi - restmass '' @xmath96 so that also holds for lorentz - violating theories .",
    "note that there is no direct relation between this mass and the effective mass square as discussed in section  [ sec : lorentz ] .    for the maxwell  chern  simons model",
    ", we obtain @xmath97 which is always less or equal than @xmath22 . with @xmath98 increasing from zero to infinity",
    ", @xmath99 interpolates monotonically between @xmath100 and @xmath101 for the @xmath31 mode and between @xmath22 and @xmath101 for the @xmath30 mode . for the scalar model ( [ eq : scalar ] ) , the quasi - restmass is constant , @xmath102    in the remainder of this article , we will focus on calculating the decay parameter @xmath77 as defined by eq .  , which , as explained above , may become momentum - dependent in lorentz - noninvariant theories .",
    "in this section , we show how the effective mass squares of section  [ sec : masses ] enter in a simple setting .",
    "the model used is the scalar model defined by the action .",
    "we , first , consider decay processes with two particles in the final state . in a lorentz - invariant theory , the phase - space integral would then be trivial because the transition amplitude square is constant .",
    "also , we start with scalar particles in order to avoid the complications of fields with spin . [ for particles with spin , different modes are split and polarization identities , such as eq .   in the first appendix , may introduce the lorentz - breaking tensors explicitly into the amplitude ; see , e.g. , eq .   below . ]",
    "in addition to the lorentz - violating particle @xmath43 with mass @xmath36 , we introduce a real lorentz - invariant scalar particle @xmath103 with mass @xmath104 .",
    "its free action is given by @xmath105 purely for illustrative purposes , we will employ _ ad hoc _ lorentz - invariant interactions between these two particles , which can , for example , be obtained by integrating out another heavy lorentz - invariant particle .",
    "the corresponding coupling constants ( generically denoted @xmath106 ) are assumed to be sufficiently small , so that the tree - level results can be used in a first approximation .",
    "regarding lorentz - noninvariance effects in tree - level decays , there are , in general , three cases to consider :    1 .   only the decay particle violates lorentz invariance ; 2 .",
    "one or more of the decay products violate lorentz invariance , but not the decay particle ; 3 .",
    "both the decay particle and at least one of the decay products violate lorentz invariance .",
    "we will discuss these three cases in turn .",
    "there is also the possibility of having explicit lorentz violation in the interaction hamiltonian , but this is of minor interest here , as we intend to study how modified dispersion relations control physical interaction processes which could naively be expected to be lorentz invariant .      in a general lorentz - invariant scalar",
    "theory , the two - particle decay @xmath107 is kinematically allowed if the mass of the decaying particle is larger than the sum of the masses of the produced particles .",
    "but , for the lorentz - violating model considered , it is really the effective mass which determines the threshold . with @xmath108",
    ", the following inequality must hold in the purely spacelike frame : @xmath109    because only the decaying particle has lorentz violation , the squared transition amplitude @xmath110 remains constant over the two - particle phase - space , as in the usual case .",
    "hence , the decay parameter is simply the product of @xmath110 and the two - particle phase - space volume , @xmath111 with the kllen function @xmath112 ; cf . ref .",
    "the phase - space volume @xmath113 depends only weakly on @xmath114 if the mass @xmath104 of the decay products is small .",
    "all in all , the decay width in the purely spacelike frame is given by @xmath115    one observes that the decay width behaves as if the decaying particle had a lorentz - invariant mass square equal to the effective mass square @xmath114 as defined by eq .  .",
    "[ the decay width has a factor @xmath116 instead of @xmath117 for an arbitrary spacelike frame . ] but , using eqs .   and",
    ", the decay width _ at rest _ is found to be given by @xmath118 which is larger by a factor @xmath119 than the width of a lorentz - invariant particle with mass square equal to @xmath114 .",
    "the reason is simply that the particle @xmath43 moves with a velocity that is different from the one of a lorentz - invariant particle with the same momentum @xmath62 and energy @xmath76 for a mass - square value equal to @xmath120 .",
    "next , consider special interactions of the type @xmath121 for an integer @xmath122 and a real coupling constant @xmath106 of mass dimension @xmath123 .",
    "provided condition holds , we then have @xmath124 for these special interactions , the decay width depends strongly on @xmath114 and , thus , on the momentum component in direction @xmath125 .",
    "this dependence is , however , accompanied by the same power of the small lorentz - violating parameter @xmath22 , according to eq .  ( [ eq : meffs - scalar ] )",
    "the decay parameter , given in terms of the effective mass square , implies a different lifetime of the scalar and antiscalar particle ( at least , at tree level ) , which is consistent with @xmath0 noninvariance @xcite .",
    "lorentz noninvariance is manifest from the nontrivial momentum dependence of @xmath126 .",
    "we , now , introduce another special interaction term , @xmath127 between the standard scalar particle @xmath103 and two lorentz - violating particles @xmath43 .",
    "interaction terms with dalembertian operator @xmath128 on @xmath103 would just produce factors @xmath129 by use of the field equation for @xmath103 .",
    "also , we do not consider other types of second derivatives on the two @xmath43 fields .",
    "the decay @xmath130 is only possible if the three - momentum @xmath79 of @xmath103 satisfies @xmath131 the phase - space integration is difficult in a general frame .",
    "we can , however , evaluate the phase - space integral in a purely spacelike frame where the integral reduces to the standard one . in this frame , the invariance with respect to boosts in a direction orthogonal to @xmath17 allows us to focus on the case of decay momentum @xmath132 , because @xmath77 can not depend on @xmath133 .",
    "then , we can reduce the phase - space integral to a one - dimensional integral over the momentum component @xmath134 of one of the decay products , @xmath135 where the integration domain is determined by energy conservation and @xmath136 is a function of the parallel components , whose explicit form is not needed if the tensor structure of the integrand is known .    for the scalar model considered ,",
    "the amplitude is still a function of the effective masses .",
    "but these effective masses are not constant over the available phase - space .",
    "the resulting decay parameter will , in general , not be a constant , even though the decaying particle has a lorentz - invariant dispersion relation .    for the interaction ,",
    "we find , in fact , the following decay parameter : @xmath137 which is consistent with the naive assumption of counting the number of derivatives in the interaction .",
    "the @xmath43 particle is also unstable against self - splitting , provided @xmath138 in this case , the lorentz noninvariance of the decay parameter has two origins : first , the decaying particle at the initial three - momentum @xmath62 and , second , the decay products averaged over the allowed phase space .    with the special ( charge - nonconserving ) interaction @xmath139 the transition amplitude square for double - splitting becomes @xmath140 for @xmath141 , one obtains after integration @xmath142 , just as expected from counting the powers of @xmath143 and @xmath134 in . for @xmath144 ,",
    "the leading term in the amplitude cancels out and @xmath77 is a constant .      in this section ,",
    "we have seen that effective mass squares , introduced in section  [ sec : masses ] , determine how the fundamental lorentz - symmetry breaking feeds into physical interaction processes . in many cases , one can also see , from the derivative structure of the interaction lagrangian , which powers of the lorentz - violating parameters appear in the transition amplitude and decay width .",
    "after the toy models of the previous section , we turn to more interesting decay processes involving maxwell  chern",
    " simons ( mcs ) photons .",
    "there are , of course , no two - particle decays in the free mcs theory and we must add charged particles ( at least , if we wish to keep the theory renormalizable ) .",
    "we , therefore , enlarge the maxwell  chern  simons model by adding conventional electrons .",
    "the relevant action is then given by @xmath145 with the chern  simons - like term for spacelike @xmath146 added to the standard quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) action @xcite , @xmath147 consisting of the maxwell term and the dirac term @xmath148 where the electron from field @xmath149 has charge @xmath150 and mass @xmath151 .",
    "as before , the two polarization modes of the mcs photon are denoted @xmath152 , corresponding to the @xmath153 sign in the dispersion relation .",
    "the kinematics and interactions allow for pair creation , @xmath154 , which has been studied previously in ref .",
    "but , this process has a threshold : pair creation is only possible for large enough photon momentum in the purely spacelike preferred frame , @xmath155 which corresponds to having an effective photon mass larger than twice the electron mass .",
    "this photon momentum is , however , far beyond the planck scale , @xmath156 for electron mass @xmath157 and a `` realistic '' value for chern  simons scale @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "photon decay into neutrinos would be an interesting alternative , if at least one neutrino mass state is strictly massless or has a mass @xmath157 of at most @xmath158 ( corresponding , for @xmath159 , to a threshold of some @xmath160 , close to the highest known energy of cosmic rays ) .",
    "but this decay amplitude only arises at one loop , as the neutrino has no electric charge .",

    "remark that the process @xmath167 is not allowed kinematically .",
    "note , furthermore , that we restrict ourselves to tree - level calculations in the theory with lorentz violation in the photon sector , but loops involving mcs photons will probably induce lorentz violation also in the fermion sector .",
    "after some @xmath77-matrix algebra and averaging ( summing ) over initial ( final ) spinor polarizations , one obtains @xmath168 inserting the polarization identity for @xmath169 and using the on - shell relation @xmath170 together with the photon dispersion law , this sum simplifies to @xmath171 here , a new feature is seen to enter two - particle decay : the lorentz - violation parameter @xmath4 is introduced explicitly into the amplitude by the modified photon polarization identity .",
    "equation contains moreover the contraction @xmath172 , although the electron itself has no direct lorentz violation .",
    "hence , it is not true that the transition amplitude square for a two - particle decay process always reduces to a function of the effective mass squares .    in the coordinate frame with @xmath8 and for initial electron momentum @xmath79 parallel to @xmath17 ,",

    "hence , the decay parameter of the electron grows approximately linearly with the momentum component in the preferred direction , but is suppressed by one power of @xmath22 , unlike the result in other theories where the decay rate increases more strongly above threshold @xcite .    for a relativistic electron , @xmath188",
