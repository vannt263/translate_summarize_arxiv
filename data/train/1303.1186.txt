    "strangelets ( also referred to as nuclearites ) are supposed to be lumps of @xmath12 quark matter . according to the witten hypothesis @xcite",
    ", @xmath13 matter is metastable and @xmath14-quarks decay by weak interaction , @xmath15 , to form more stable @xmath12 matter .",
    "these lumps could be formed in explosive events like a ns undergoing a phase transition to a qs as proposed in dark matter ( dm)-driven scenarios @xcite or in the high - density environments of a compact object merger event @xcite .",
    "direct searches are being conducted by , e.g. , ground - experiments at the lhc ( alice and cms experiment with the castor calorimeters ) or in space with the ams-02 spectrometer .",
    "the mass number , @xmath16 , of a stable strangelet can potentially range from a @xmath17 to @xmath18 . when considering a general non - zero strangeness - content",
    ", there is a nuclear stability valley for strangelets with baryonic number @xmath16 and there is a poorly known minimum value of mass number @xmath19 @xcite below which they are unbound .",
    "typical values of strangelet binding energy are currently uncertain but supposed to be @xmath20 energies .",
    "there is not much information on their possible charge value @xmath21 but it should be small and ( most likely ) positive for finite lumps @xcite .",
    "several models of strangelets exist that lead to various @xmath22 dependencies .",
    "for example , for ordinary strangelets , @xmath23 , while for cfl ( color - flavour - locked ) strangelets @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "even smaller charge - to - mass ratios are allowed @xmath25 .",
    "experiments such as cream and ams-02 will have the ability to perform a direct measurement of the charge , and infer estimates of @xmath22 .",
    "if strangelets were responsible for the observed hotspots , they should produce detectable air - showers .",
    "this is possible if the kinetic energy per nucleon content , @xmath26 , satisfies @xmath27gev .",
    "measurements indicate a total kinetic energy of particles in hotspots , @xmath28tev - pev , which implies @xmath29 .",
    "neutron stars have been suggested as possible accelerators of strangelets @xcite .",
    "strangelets could be produced for instance in the course of a ns to qs transition @xcite . in such events , a fraction @xmath30 of the gravitational energy released",
    "can be injected into the expelled outer crust , leading to total kinetic energies @xmath31erg for standard ns mass and radius @xcite .",
    "the lorentz factor of the ejected mass can be of order @xmath32 , for ns mass @xmath33 , radius @xmath34 , and ejected mass @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "particles of mass number @xmath16 could then gain energies of order @xmath36 , the typical energy observed in hotspots .",
    "accelerated stranglets may experience energy losses by interacting with the radiation field close to the ns , and with the baryonic and radiative backgrounds of the supernova ( sn ) envelope .",
    "@xcite concluded that there is room for the escape of accelerated particles .",
    "the discussion can be adapted to our case , except that strangelets are likely to have higher binding energies @xcite , which will further help the escape . besides",
    ", old ns may have a higher chance to undergo a transition @xcite , negligible radiative fields and no surrounding sn envelopes .",
    "once they have escaped from the source , strangelets diffuse in the magnetized interstellar medium ( ism ) . the trajectory of strangelets should be totally diffusive , even when assuming a low charge .",
    "they can reach the earth on a timescale @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the distance to the source and the diffusion coefficient is set to @xmath39^{1/3}$]@xmath40s@xmath41 , with @xmath42 the height of the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "the ionization and the spallation timescales in the ism ( of average density @xmath43 ) read respectively @xmath44yrs , and @xmath45yrs @xcite , implying that spallation should affect particles only mildly during their flight from sources located within 1kpc .",
    "spallation could however play a prominent role if the source is born in or near a molecular cloud .",
    "molecular clouds are the densest regions of the ism , and consist mainly of molecular hydrogen .",
    "their typical radius in the galaxy is @xmath46pc , and their density @xmath47 . in such regions ,",
    "the spallation fraction can exceed unity , reaching @xmath48 , with @xmath49 the diffusion time of strangelets in the cloud . the electron capture rate for strangelets in clouds with free electron density @xmath50 ( with @xmath51 ) should be a fraction of the ionization rate , of order @xmath52 .",
    "as strangelets are predicted to be more bound than standard nuclei , these estimates can be viewed as upper limits for spallation . for electron",
    "capture , it is possible that the large size of strangelets dominates the effects of the charge , implying a scaling in @xmath53 , and the rates quoted here can be viewed as a lower limit .",
    "a fraction of strangelets undergoing spallation or electron capture ( similar to that quoted for regular ions @xcite ) may generate neutral secondaries .",
    "the work of @xcite suggests that a tiny parameter space exists where spallation could lead to bound neutral strangelets .",
    "neutral strangelets can then propagate rectilinearly to the earth and produce a hotspot in the sky of the angular size of the mc , @xmath54 , with @xmath55 the distance of the mc to the observer .",
    "note that this corresponds roughly to the size of the observed hotspots .",
    "the mc can radiate a total energy in neutral strangelets of @xmath56 ^ 2}$ ] , with @xmath57 , the effective distance travelled by a diffusing particle over the rectilinear distance @xmath58 , separating the center of the source to the center of the mc .",
    "the factor @xmath59 is a free parameter that accounts for strangelet production rate at the source , and the low strangelet neutralization rate in the mc .",
    "this expression is only valid for @xmath60 . if the source is located at the center of a mc , all the produced particles diffuse in the cloud , and @xmath61 .",
    "the total energy of neutral strangelets radiated by the mc can then be expressed over the whole range of @xmath58 as @xmath62^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the excess signal in a solid angle @xmath63 around one source can be defined as the following signal - to - noise ratio : @xmath64 , where @xmath65 indicates the number of events expected in a solid angle @xmath63 from a source and @xmath66 the corresponding number of events expected for an isotropic background . for a mc located at",
    "coordinates @xmath67 , at distance @xmath55 , and separated by @xmath58 from the source , the signal at energy @xmath68 can then be estimated as : @xmath69^{-1}\\frac{e_{\\rm ej}}{\\delta t}\\frac{a(\\alpha , \\delta)^{1/2}}{4\\pi d_{\\rm mc}^2\\omega j_{\\rm iso , sr}^{1/2}}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath70 [ in m@xmath71  s  sr ] is the exposure of an experiment in the direction @xmath67 , @xmath72 is the observed cosmic ray flux at energy @xmath68 , per steradian , and @xmath73 is the diffusion time for particles to travel over a distance @xmath74 . for a source located inside the mc ,",
    "the luminosity in neutral strangelets radiated by the mc at @xmath75tev is of order @xmath76 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigma ] presents contours of the value of @xmath77 ( eq .  [ eq : sigma ] ) for strangelets with @xmath78 , @xmath79 at @xmath75tev , as a function of @xmath55 and @xmath58 , for a mc of radius @xmath80pc . for each set of distances",
    "@xmath81 , the signal @xmath77 is calculated for a solid angle @xmath82 corresponding to an angle in the sky of @xmath83 .",
    "this takes into account the minimum smoothing angle of the anisotropy analysis conducted by milagro and icecube ( @xmath84 for milagro @xcite and @xmath85 for icecube @xcite ) .",
    "cosmic ray measurements indicate @xmath86ev@xmath41  s@xmath41  m@xmath87 sr@xmath41 , and we chose an exposure of @xmath88m@xmath89ssr , roughly corresponding to the milagro exposure at @xmath90tev , over 7 years of operation .    in our calculation , we set the efficiency factor to @xmath91 .",
    "efficiencies in the range of @xmath92 lead to reasonable values in terms of @xmath77 ( as @xmath93 ) , whatever the relative location of the source and the mc , and the distance to the mc . from eq .",
    "[ eq : sigma ] , one can infer the strong dependency of @xmath77 on the distance between the source and the mc : @xmath94 , when the source is at the border of the mc . on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] shows that the value of @xmath77 is relatively constant as long as the source is at a relatively central position inside the mc .",
    "this range of @xmath59 thus implies that only mc within @xmath95kpc , and only sources _ located inside the mc _ can produce a significant hotspot ( note also that local mcs are found beyond @xmath96pc ) .",
    "such low values of this effective parameter @xmath59 leave room for combined uncertainties in possibly low strangelet injection at the source , strangelet acceleration , and neutralization efficiencies in the cloud .",
    "all these are largely unknown but it is expected that the fraction of strangelet ejected mass at the source should be at most @xmath97 of the mass difference in the transitioning ns and qs configurations @xcite .",
    "the neutralization rates in the cloud should be a small fraction of @xmath98 and @xmath99 for spallation and electron capture respectively .",
    "magnetic fields in mcs are known to scale approximately with gas density as @xmath100 relative to the mean galactic magnetic field .",
    "the diffusion coefficient scales in @xmath101 in the kolmogorov diffusion regime . taking into account these stronger fields would thus only result in an order of magnitude difference in @xmath77 , and the variations could be absorbed by the uncertainty in the efficiency factor @xmath59 .",
    "whether the ns - qs transition actually gives birth to a pulsar is unknown .",
    "hence strangelet sources will not necessarily be found at the position of an active source , and one reasonable assumption would be that they are distributed as old ns . in general these are everywhere , including in mc .",
    "indeed , the number density of old ns in the galaxy is of order @xmath102 @xcite , and if 10% of them do not get kicks at birth ( i.e. , remain in the mc ) , their mean separation is 20 pc .",
    "molecular clouds and gamma ray pulsars have a similar distribution on the sky , while radio pulsars cover a much wider age range and have a broader distribution .",
    "the fraction of old neutron stars that are required to undergo ns - qs transition in order to account for the handful of observed hotspots is @xmath103 .",
    "the diffusion time of strangelets in mcs , i.e. , the time over which each source will be observable , is of order @xmath104yrs .",
    "this implies a ns - qs transition rate of order @xmath105 .",
    "( eq .  [ eq : sigma ] ) , as would be observed by milagro with 7 years of data , at @xmath75tev , as a function of the distance of the mc to the earth , @xmath55 , and the distance between the source and the mc , @xmath58 , for strangelets with @xmath78 , @xmath79 and a mc of radius @xmath80pc , source of luminosity @xmath106erg / s , and an efficiency factor @xmath91 .",
    "color bar : value of @xmath77 , black lines : specific numerical values of @xmath77 as indicated . ]",
    "most observed hotspots could be produced by mcs in the gould belt ( a star forming region concentrating many mcs , that forms a ring at a distance from the sun of @xmath107kpc ) , at the location where ns - qs transitions may have occurred .",
    "interestingly , the milagro hotspot labelled  region a \" @xcite lies in the direction of the taurus molecular cloud , the nearest star formation region located at 140pc , and that covers @xmath108 in the sky @xcite .",
    " region 1 \" of icecube @xcite is also in the direction of a remarkable mc : the vela molecular ridge , located at @xmath109kpc distance , of size @xmath5 in sky @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to predict whether strangelets could produce air - showers conspicuously different from those from ordinary cosmic rays , mainly because their cross - section is not known .",
    "preliminary hadronic simulations with epos and conex show that the strangelet heavy mass ( expected to produce shallow showers with low fluctuations ) and its high binding energy ( with the oposite effect ) could also compensate each other to produce ordinary cosmic ray showers @xcite .",
    "it leaves room for the possibility that the cosmic rays observed by @xcite actually be strangelets , that were not identified ( as long as @xmath29 , see earlier discussion ) .",
    "icecube also reported composition measurements from 1 to 30 pev , that are compatible with ordinary cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "the muon rate for strangelets is expected to increase in @xmath110 , which should not have a noticeable impact for our values of @xmath16 .",
    "this again is consistent with the icecube reports .",
    "finally , our model predicts point - like cosmic ray sources farther than a few kpc . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] , the cut - off of the signal at distances @xmath111kpc stems from the limited resolution angle and sensitivity of the instruments , which set the smoothing angle for the anisotropy search .",
    "indeed , as the angular size of the mc in the sky diminishes , the signal is diluted inside one angular bin , and can not be distinguished from the noise . with better resolution and sensitivity ( with the high altitude water cherenkov observatory , hawc , for example ) , the excess signal could remain high at larger distances , and point - like sources could be spotted .",
    "this scenario could also lead to multi - messenger signatures in secondary neutrinos or gamma - rays .",
    "these particles could be produced directly at the source when strangelets are generated , or when particles undergo spallation in the clouds . in the former case",
    ", the secondary signal should be point - like .",
    "in the latter case , the whole mc could be illuminated , and the expected gamma - ray flux should be comparable to the product of a multiplicity factor multiplied by the hot spot flux .",
    "the multiplicity factor is of the order of the spallation fraction in the mc or @xmath112 the predicted flux over solid angle @xmath82 sr is @xmath113 this should be compared with the expected flux of cosmic ray induced gammas .",
    "+ we discussed the possibility that strangelets accelerated in nearby ns - qs transitions , and then becoming neutral by spallation or electron capture in molecular clouds , could explain the small - scale anisotropies observed by several experiments at tev - pev energies . with reasonable astrophysical assumptions regarding ns - qs transition rates , particle injection and neutralization rates , we can reproduce successfully the observed hotspot characteristics and their distribution in the sky .",
