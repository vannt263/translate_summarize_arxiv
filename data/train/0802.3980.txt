    "the control over multipartite devices , used for the purposes of quantum communication and quantum computation , can be reduced by means of specific form of built - in and permanent intra - register couplings .",
    "this possibility has recently been the center of a strong interest of the quantum information processing ( qip ) community.@xcite the price to pay in order to avoid generally demanding fast and accurate inter - qubit switching and gating is the pre - engineering of appropriate patterns of couplings .",
    "such a scenario is in general indicated as _ control - limited_. the efforts are in this case directed towards the determination of the exact distribution of coupling strengths for a given inter - qubit interaction model in a control - limited setting .",
    "here we discuss a recently proposed approach that sheds new light onto the achievement of this task and the design of efficient qip protocols .    in ref .",
    "we have introduced the concept of _ information flux _ in a quantum mechanical system .",
    "this can be seen in terms of the influences that the dynamics of a selected element of a multipartite register experience due to _ interaction channels _ with any other parties .",
    "we showed that information can be effectively processed by arranging the network of interactions in a way so as to privilege or repress specific interaction channels .",
    "the realization of an optimal qip task is therefore translated into the maximization of the information flux associated with such channels . here",
    "we give a deeper insight into the mechanism behind this tool and , therefore , a clear and intuitive picture of it by providing an explicit example .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "let us consider a register of @xmath0 interacting qubits coupled via the hamiltonian @xmath1 whose structure we do not need to specify here .",
    "our assumption is that @xmath1 depends on a set of parameters @xmath2 ( which could stand for the coupling strengths between the elements of the register ) and a generalized time parameter @xmath3 .",
    "we adopt the notation according to which @xmath4 @xmath5 is the operator that applies the @xmath6 pauli - matrix only to the @xmath7-th qubit of the register . here",
    "@xmath8 is the @xmath9 identity matrix of qubit @xmath7 . in the remainder of the paper",
    ", we work in the heisenberg picture where time - evolved operators are indicated as @xmath10 with @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "we say that _ there is information _ extractable from qubit @xmath7 at time @xmath3 _ _ whenever there is at least one @xmath12 for which @xmath13 . here , the expectation value is calculated over the initial state of the register @xmath14 .",
    "we adopt , hereafter , the following schematic description of a computation or communication process : we suppose to have access to a selected qubit of a multipartite register and we consider it as the input terminal of the black box given by the rest of the elements and their mutual coupling .",
    "we then use a detection stage which can be attached to a suitable output port , connected to one of the qubits in the black box ( a sketch is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) . in this picture , the initial state of a quantum system is described by the state vector @xmath15 .",
    "this is the case in which the first qubit is initialized in a generic _ input _ state ( and is separable with respect to the rest of the register ) and @xmath16 represents the initial state of the other qubits that , in general , can be mutually entangled .",
    "we assume this state to be known and independent of the input state .",
    "the assumption of a known initial state of the register @xmath17 corresponds to the situation assumed in many control - limited qip protocols .",
    "we can thus interpret a quantum process as the _ flux _ of appropriately processed information from the input qubit to the remaining components of the register .",
    "such a flux is witnessed by any explicit dependence of the dynamics of the @xmath18-th qubit on the operators associated with the input one .",
    "therefore , in order to find if qubit @xmath18 has developed any extractable information at time @xmath3 , as a result of an information flux from the input qubit , we need to study the dependence of @xmath19 s on at least one of @xmath20 s @xmath21 .",
    "we refer to ref .   for mathematical details and for the formal definition of the information flux . here",
    "we would like just to specify that this approach consists in the decomposition of each @xmath22 over the operator - basis built out of all the possible tensorial products of single - qubit operators acting on the elements of the system @xmath23 .",
    "the information flux can be evaluated from the expectation value ( over @xmath16 ) of the participants to this decomposition which include operators of the first qubit .",
    "the control over the set \\{g } can be fully utilized in the preparation of a multipartite device in the most appropriate configuration of couplings and initial state , for a given qip task .",
    "the potential of this approach is better illustrated in refs .",
    ",  . in what follows ,",
    "in order to show a practical application of this method , we will address explicitly the case of quantum state transfer .",
    "quantum state transfer in spin chains is a scenario where the information flux approach is particularly useful . for short - distance communication ,",
    "the idea of using spin chains as _",
    "quantum wires _ has been put forward by bose.@xcite with an isotropic heisenberg interaction and a local magnetic field , a transmission fidelity that exceeds the maximum value achievable classically can be obtained for a chain up to @xmath24 qubits .",
    "later , christandl _ et al .",
    "_ showed that , by engineering the strength of the couplings in the chain , a unit fidelity can be reached in for end - to - end transfer in a linear chain , among topologically more complicated situations.@xcite    we will first analyze an open three - qubit chain , whose hamiltonian reads @xmath25 with @xmath26 the coupling strength of the pairwise interaction between the qubits .",
    "this is an instance of the linear model considered in ref .   and thus perfect state transfer from the first to the third qubit",
    "is obtained after a time @xmath27 [ we set @xmath28 throughout the paper ] , if the initial state of spin 2 and 3 is @xmath29",
    ". if we want to determine the information flux from the first to the last qubit , we should evaluate the evolution of @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 can be seen as @xmath33 ) in the heisenberg picture , at time @xmath3 .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath34 with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "the only term in the decomposition of the evolved operator @xmath38 ( @xmath39(t ) ) in which @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) is present is @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the information flux from @xmath40 to @xmath30 ( @xmath41 to @xmath31 ) is therefore @xmath44 [ @xmath45 . for @xmath46",
    ", we have @xmath47",
    ". a perfect state transfer should correspond to an information flux between homonymous operators equal to 1 .",
    "the minus sign we found can be explained by remembering that , in christandl s protocol , we need to apply a single - qubit rotation @xmath48 on the last qubit , after the action of the hamiltonian @xmath49 , in order to compensate an additional phase factor arising from the evolution .",
    "the inclusion of this gate into our evolution just corresponds to change @xmath30 in @xmath50 and @xmath31 in @xmath51 , keeping @xmath32 unchanged .",
    "we thus obtain information flux from @xmath40 to @xmath30 and from @xmath41 to @xmath31 ( and obviously from @xmath52 to @xmath32 ) equal to @xmath53 , at time @xmath46 .",
    "in general , a decomposition over the operator - basis can be demanding , especially for a large number of qubits .",
    "indeed , the dimension of this basis is @xmath54 . in some cases , in virtue of the symmetries of the interaction model ( as in the example analyzed above ) , the evolution of @xmath55 involves only few elements of this basis .",
    "a simple method to estimate which terms are included in this evolution is presented here .    for a time - independent hamiltonian ,",
    "it is @xmath56 and by means of the operator expansion formula , we have @xmath57+\\frac{1}{2!}(\\frac{i}{\\hbar}t)^2[{\\hat{\\cal h}},[{\\hat{\\cal h}},\\hat{{\\sigma}_i}]]+ .. \\ ] ] if the hamiltonian @xmath58 is expressed in terms of operators @xmath59 s all the commutators can be easily represented in a graph .",
    "suppose , for instance , that we want to analyze a 5-qubit chain , whose hamiltonian reads @xmath60 , focusing on the evolution of @xmath61 .",
    "the first commutators are @xmath62=-2i\\,j_4\\,\\hat{y}_4\\hat{z}_5,\\\\    & [ { \\hat{\\cal h}},\\hat{y}_4\\hat{z}_5]=2i\\,j_3\\,\\hat{x}_3\\hat{z}_4\\hat{z}_5 + 2i\\,j_4\\,\\hat{x}_5,\\\\    & ..",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] the only operators involved in this iterative sequence are @xmath61 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "therefore it is possible to write the evolved operators @xmath67 as @xmath68 in those cases where the parameters @xmath69 can not be analytically evaluated due to the complications in the evolution , it is possible to approximate them by means of recurrence formulas . in our case ,",
    "we have @xmath70\\gamma_j^{(l)}$ ] , where @xmath71 is a proper cut - off and @xmath72 with @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) for @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) . this analysis can be summarized in the oriented graph in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] .",
    "each node corresponds to an operator involved in the decomposition , while an edge connect a node to the operator resulting from its commutator with the hamiltonian .",
    "we show the corresponding coefficient and an outgoing ( ingoing ) edge corresponds to a @xmath77 ( - ) sign .",
    "the factor @xmath78 has been omitted for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the recurrence formulas can be easily derived from this graph . for @xmath79 ,",
    "the spin chain becomes the one in ref .   and",
    "the recurrence formulas give @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 . at @xmath85",
    "we have @xmath86 and @xmath87 , which corresponds to perfect state transfer .",
    "of course , not all the spin chains are associated to a graph with a linear structure .",
    "for example , if we analyze the hamiltonian @xmath88 , we obtain the graph in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph2 ] * ( a)*.    in this case , the decomposition of @xmath89 involves two elements in which @xmath40 is present . therefore , the information flux from @xmath40 to @xmath30 ( this time again we consider the initial state @xmath90 ) is @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the coefficients of @xmath40 and @xmath94 , respectively . a plot of @xmath95 , evaluated by means of recurrence formulas , is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph2 ] * ( b)*. in this case @xmath95 never reaches @xmath74 ( it is well known that this hamiltonian does not allow perfect state transfer ) . to highlight the fact that the information flux can be used as a proper figure of merit in quantum state transfer processes",
    ", we have also plotted the state fidelity @xmath96 in the worst case ( i.e. , the transmission of the initial state @xmath97 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph2 ] * ( c ) * : the maxima in the two plots appear for the same values of scaled time @xmath98 , showing the useful correspondence between information flux and state fidelity .",
    "we have shown how the information flux approach helps in the analysis of many - body systems , particularly in the case of spin chains .",
    "we have presented a graphical method that is useful to derive the recurrence formulas to evaluate the information flux , when it is not possible to obtain it analytically .",
    "the analogy between the information flux in the model of ref .   and in a transverse ising model with local magnetic fields has paved the way to the idea presented in a recent paper.@xcite the linear structure of the graphs associated with the two problems allowed us to obtain a coupling - strength pattern that guarantees a perfect state transfer also in a spin - non - preserving chain .",
