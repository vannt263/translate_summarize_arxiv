    "our understanding of logarithmic conformal field theory ( lcft ) has greatly improved recently thanks to a renewed focus on purely algebraic features and in particular a systematic study of virasoro indecomposable modules .",
    "most of the developments have concerned boundary lcfts , where two lines of attack have been pursued .",
    "the first one is rather abstract , and follows the pioneering work of rohsiepe  @xcite and gaberdiel  @xcite , where , in particular , fusion is interpreted as the tensor product of the symmetry algebra  @xcite . the other  @xcite is somehow more concrete , in that it relies on lattice regularizations , and exploits the ( not entirely understood ) similarity  @xcite between the properties of lattice models and their conformally invariant continuum limits .",
    "the models involved in this second approach provide  @xcite representations of associative algebras such as the temperley ",
    "lieb algebra .",
    "it turns out that the representation theory of these algebras is , in a certain ( categorical , see sec .",
    "[ categorical ] ) sense  @xcite , similar to the one of chiral algebras in lcft .",
    "the structure of indecomposable modules and fusion rules can then be predicted from the analysis of the scaling limit of the lattice models  @xcite .",
    "the results are in perfect agreement ( so far ) with the conclusions of the first approach based on ( considerably more involved ) calculations in the virasoro algebra  @xcite .",
    "to be now a little more precise , the general philosophy of the lattice approach in the boundary case relies on the analysis of the microscopic model as a bi - module over two algebras . in physical terms ,",
    "one of these algebras is generated by the local hamiltonian density , and the other is the ` symmetry ' commuting with the hamiltonian densities .",
    "more precisely , the types of models we are interested in carry alternating fundamental representations of a super lie algebra , and admit a single invariant nearest neighbor coupling , the ` super equivalent ' of the heisenberg interaction @xmath17 . the different @xmath18 s turn out to obey some non - trivial algebraic relations , so that the models provide a representation of a certain abstract algebra @xmath19  the ordinary and boundary temperley ",
    "lieb algebras for instance .",
    "meanwhile , the local hamiltonians are invariant under the super lie algebra .",
    "in fact , they typically are invariant under a bigger algebra which is , in technical terms , the centralizer of @xmath19 .",
    "we recall here that the centralizer @xmath20 of an algebra @xmath19 on their common representation space @xmath21 is the algebra of all intertwining operators @xmath22 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the algebra of the maximum dimension such that @xmath23=0 $ ] .",
    "for the open case of @xmath24-symmetric spin chains , this centralizer was dubbed @xmath25 in @xcite , where it was shown to be morita equivalent to @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "usually , the representation theory of this centralizer  typically a quantum group or an algebra morita equivalent to one  is easier to study than the representation theory of @xmath19 or its scaling  limit , a chiral algebra . in general , all these algebras are not semi - simple , and give rise to complicated indecomposable modules .",
    "the point is , in part , that these modules have , even for finite spin chains , properties which are closely related with those of the associated lcft .",
    "while the key observation in @xcite about the similarity between the algebraic properties of the lattice models and their logarithmic continuum limit is not entirely understood , it can be then interpreted in some cases at least in terms of quantum groups .",
    "recent studies of centralizers of chiral algebras ( virasoro and w - algebras ) in continuum logarithmic models have indeed unraveled a remarkable equivalence  @xcite between the representation theory and the fusion rules of the chiral algebras and certain quantum groups .",
    "it is exactly the same quantum groups that appear as centralizers in the lattice models , hence providing the link between finite size and scaling limit properties .",
    "turning now to bulk lcfts , progress has been more modest .",
    "the problem is that , on the more abstract side , one now expects indecomposability under the left and right actions of the virasoro algebras , leading to potentially very complicated modules which have proven too hard to study so far , except in some special cases .",
    "these include bulk logarithmic theories  @xcite with w - algebra symmetries  @xcite , and wzw models on supergroups which , albeit very simple as far as lcfts go , provide interesting lessons on the coupling of left and right sectors  @xcite . on the more concrete side , while it is possible to define and study lattice models whose continuum limit is a ( bulk ) lcft , the underlying structures are also very difficult to get : symmetries are smaller , and the lattice algebras have much more complicated representation theory . nevertheless , it looks possible to generalize the approach in  @xcite thanks to recent results about the centralizer @xmath28 of the jones  temperley  lieb ( jtl ) algebra .",
    "this paper present our first results in this direction for the @xmath0 case .",
    "it is based on two technical companion papers . in the first one  @xcite",
    ", we focussed on the symmetries of the spin chain , that is , the centralizer , in the alternating product of the @xmath0 fundamental representation and its dual , of the jtl algebra . we proved that this centralizer is only a subalgebra of @xmath26 at @xmath29 that we dubbed @xmath30 .",
    "we then analyzed the continuum limit of the jtl algebra : using general arguments about the regularization of the stress - energy tensor , we identified families of jtl elements going over to the virasoro generators @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we also discussed the well known @xmath33 symmetry of symplectic fermions from the lattice point of view , and showed that this symmetry , albeit present in the continuum limit , does not have a simple , useful analog on the lattice . in our second paper",
    "@xcite , we analyzed the decomposition of the spin chain over the jones  temperley ",
    "lieb algebra , and obtained the full decomposition as a bimodule over @xmath30 and @xmath2 .",
    "equipped with these results , we can now explore to what extent the remarkable properties observed in the open case @xcite carry over to the bulk case .",
    "our conclusion is that the algebraic properties of the finite periodic spin chain and the bulk lcft are again very similar .",
    "the crucial new ingredient is that the jtl algebra goes over , in the continuum limit , to a bigger algebra than @xmath3 , the product of the left and right virasoro algebras .",
    "this algebra  which we call _ interchiral _ , mixes the left and right moving sectors , and is generated , in the symplectic fermions case , by the additional field @xmath34 with conformal weights @xmath7 .",
    "most of the present work is devoted to identifying this algebra @xmath4 , studying its properties , and using it to provide a new analysis of the symplectic fermions lcft .",
    "we believe that the concept of interchiral algebra will prove fundamental in the analysis of more complicated cases  in particular those at central charge @xmath35  as will be discussed in forthcoming work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start in section [ sec : remind ] by a reminder of the main algebraic features , both on the lattice and in the scaling limit , for the open @xmath0 spin chain ( and its @xmath36 generalizations ) . in section [ sec : remindclosed ]",
    "we similarly remind the reader of the main algebraic properties of the closed @xmath0 spin chain .",
    "the latter involves now a ` periodic ' version of the temperley ",
    "lieb algebra which we call , following  @xcite , the jones  temperley ",
    "lieb algebra @xmath2 , and a smaller symmetry algebra @xmath30 which is , up to some trivial elements , its centralizer @xmath28 .",
    "the structure of the corresponding bimodule is recalled in fig .",
    "[ jtl - uqodd - bimod ] .",
    "we also mention briefly the antiperiodic spin chain ( where the @xmath0 symmetry is broken ) , where one now deals with a twisted version @xmath37 of the jones  temperley ",
    "lieb algebra , while the centralizer is just @xmath38 algebra .",
    "section  [ howe ] is the first containing new results .",
    "we discuss there how , remarkably , the image of the @xmath2 in the @xmath0 spin chains is in fact isomorphic to ( the image of ) the enveloping algebra of a certain non - semisimple lie algebra containing @xmath8 as its maximal semi - simple subalgebra .",
    "the semi - simple part of @xmath2 ( that is , after quotienting by the radical ) is represented by @xmath9 , providing a beautiful example of a classical howe duality  @xcite , for which we have a non semi - simple version in the full @xmath2 case .",
    "this relationship with a lie algebra provides us with a powerful tool to understand the scaling limit of @xmath2 , which we call the * interchiral algebra*. this is discussed in section [ sec : interchiral ] , which is , conceptually , the main section of this paper . for general models",
    ", we expect that the scaling limit of @xmath2 will contain , in addition to the left and right virasoro algebras , the modes of non chiral fields such as the degenerate conformal field @xmath39 . in the particular case of symplectic fermions",
    ", this field becomes the _ interchiral field _",
    "@xmath40 from  , and the scaling limit of @xmath2 can be fully understood in terms of _ bilinears in fermion modes_. this is discussed in subsections  [ sec : scaling ] , [ commrels ] and  for the centralizer aspects  [ centra ] .",
    "the seemingly equivalent and more physical point of view where instead of bilinears in fermion modes we have bilinears in fermionic fields is discussed in subsection [ sec : interch - modes ] . finally , we define the interchiral algebra proper in subsection [ sec : interdef ] where it is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "subsection [ sec : interchalg - tw ] extends the discussion to the antiperiodic model or the so - called `` twisted sector '' . in section",
    "[ sec : simpl - jtl - vir ] we discuss modules over the interchiral algebra in the lcft and their relation with @xmath2 modules on the lattice .",
    "we consider first simple modules in subsection [ sec : interinfin - sm ] to [ sec : gen - func ] .",
    "while on the finite lattice the simples are just fundamental representations of @xmath8 , in the limit simple modules over @xmath4 are identified with appropriate simple @xmath10-modules . of particular importance is our discussion of the vacuum module over the interchiral algebra in [ sec : interch - simple ] . in subsection [ sec : indecompmod ] we discuss indecomposable modules over @xmath4 and their relation with the symplectic fermion theory .",
    "this involves an analysis of the hilbert space of this theory as a module over the left - right virasoro algebra @xmath41 ( which we believe is new ) in subsubsection [ sec : non - chiral - sympl - fer ] .",
    "we then show that this analysis agrees with the scaling limit of the bimodule over @xmath2 and @xmath28 .",
    "a few conclusions  and pointers to subsequent developments  are given in the conclusion .",
