    "her x-1 , being an eclipsing accretion powered pulsar consisting of a @xmath5 s period pulsar in a @xmath1 day circular orbit , was discovered in 1972 with _",
    "uhuru _ observations ( tananbaum et al . 1972 ) .",
    "soon after its discovery , its optical companion was identified to be a blue variable thirteenth magnitude star hz her ( davidsen al .",
    "1972 ) . the her x-1/hz her binary system was shown to display a 35 day long cycle of high and low x - ray flux states .",
    "there are two high states , main high and short high , within a single 35 day cycle lasting roughly about 10 and 5 days respectively and separated by @xmath6 day long low states ( giacconi et al .",
    "1973 ; scott & leahy 1999 ) . superposed on this cycle are eclipses of the neutron star by the companion once per orbital period .",
    "while 35 day cycle is mostly coherent since the discovery of the source , there have been four occasions so far when the high states have either failed to turn - on or main high state flux has been reduced ( i.e. _ anomalous low states _ , see parmar et al .",
    "1985 ; vrtilek et al .",
    "1994 ; oosterbroek et al .",
    "2000 ; boyd et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the nature of the 35 day cycle is generally attributed to the periodic variable obscuration of the emission region by a precessing accretion disc viewed nearly edge - on ( e.g. petterson 1975 ; scott & leahy 1999 ; scott , leahy , wilson 2000 ; leahy 2004 ) .",
    "it has been claimed that there is no strict periodicity of this precession ( ogelman 1987 ) : `` 35 day cycles '' generally have durations of 20 , 20.5 and 21 orbital cycles with equal statistical probabilities which may lead to the idea that the precession and orbital cycles are related physically ( scott & leahy 1999 ) .",
    "baykal et al .",
    "( 1993 ) revealed that the statistical interpretation of turn - on behaviour is consistent with a white - noise process in the first derivative of the 35 days phase fluctuations .",
    "other manifestations of 35 day cycle include spectral variations in 35 days ( mihara et al .",
    "1991 ; choi et al . 1994b ; leahy 1995 ; leahy 2001 ; zane et al .",
    "2004 ) , 35 day x - ray pulse profile evolution ( scott et al . 2000 ) , optical pulsations occurring at certain 35 day and orbital phases ( middleditch 1983 ) , and systematic 35 day variations in the optical light curve ( deeter et al .",
    "1976 ; gerend & boynton 1976 ) .",
    "distinct features of high states of her x-1 in x - ray band are the preeclipse x - ray absorption dips occurring at @xmath7 orbital phase ( giacconi et al . 1973 ; crosa & boynton 1980 ) , and anomalous dips ( giacconi et al . 1973 ; scott & leahy 1999 ) occurring at @xmath8 orbital phase .",
    "both types of dips are thought to be due to absorption of cold matter on the line of sight .",
    "the occurrence period of the x - ray dips is thought to be related to the beat period of 35 days and 1.7 days ( @xmath9 days ) , thus they progress to earlier orbital phases within main high and short high states .",
    "more detailed features of preeclipse and anomalous dips of her x-1 were discussed by leahy et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , reynolds & parmar ( 1995 ) , leahy ( 1997 ) , shakura et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and stelzer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "although considerable changes in the x - ray spectrum in 35 day cycle have been found to be evident , the x - ray spectrum in different 35 day phases can be fitted using a constant - emission model with varying absorption ( e.g. mihara et al .",
    "1991 ; leahy 2001 ) .",
    "this is another supporting fact that 35 day cycle is due to the precession of an accretion disc that periodically obscures the neutron star beam .",
    "in other words , spectral variations in x - ray band are not primarily due to the variations of the primary outgoing beam of the neutron star but rather due to changes in absorption .",
    "being the first accretion powered pulsar found to have cyclotron absorption feature ( truemper et al .",
    "1978 ) , x - ray spectrum of her x-1 shows this absorption feature around @xmath10 kev which indicates a surface magnetic field of @xmath11 gauss .",
    "there is no evidence of a second harmonic around @xmath12 kev ( coburn et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "iron line complex at @xmath13 kev is evident in the x - ray spectrum of her x-1 ( leahy 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , endo , nagase & mihara ( 2000 ) were able to resolve the feature into two discrete emission lines at @xmath14 kev and @xmath15 kev .",
    "a distinct fe xxvi line at @xmath16 kev was detected with xmm - newton throughout 35 day cycle except the main high ( zane et al .",
    "variations in iron line complex feature over the 35 day period and and the spin period have been evident ( e.g. choi et al . 1994 ) , while variations of this complex feature with the orbital phase have also been studied ( e.g. zane et al . 2004 ) .    in this paper ,",
    "results of spectral analysis of december 2001 low state and short high state rxte data of her x-1 are presented .",
    "this set of observations enables , for the first time , frequent continuous monitoring ( 111 pointings in @xmath0 days ) of the source with rxte including @xmath1 days ( @xmath17 orbital period ) long low state part and the following @xmath2 days ( @xmath18 orbital periods ) long short high state part .",
    "section 2 is an overview about the instruments and the observations . in section 3",
    ", we present the analysis of the observations . in section 4 , results are discussed .",
    "[ fig1_herx1 ]",
    "the rxte observations used in this paper cover the period from 18 to 26 december 2001 ( mjd 52261 - 52269 ) with a total exposure of 281.2 ksec ( figure 1 ) .",
    "these observations have common proposal i d 60017 . the results presented here",
    "are based on data collected with the proportional counter array ( pca , jahoda et al . , 1996 ) and the high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte , rothschild et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the pca instrument consists of an array of 5 proportional counters ( pcu ) operating in the 2 - 60 kev energy range , with a total effective area of approximately 6250 @xmath19 and a field of view of @xmath20 fwhm . although the number of active pcu s varied between 2 and 5 during the observations , observations after 2000 may 13 belong to the observational epoch for which background level for one of the pcus ( pcu0 ) increased due to the fact that this pcu started to operate without a propane layer .",
    "the latest combined background models ( cm ) are used together with ftools 5.3 to estimate the appropriate pca background .",
    "the hexte instrument consists of two independent clusters of detectors , each cluster containing four nai(ti)/csi(na ) phoswich scintillation counters ( one of the detectors in cluster 2 is not used for spectral information ) sharing a common @xmath20 fwhm .",
    "the field of view of each cluster is switched on and off source to provide background measurements .",
    "the net open area of the seven detectors used for spectroscopy is 1400 @xmath21 .",
    "each detector covers the energy range 15 - 250 kev .",
    "spectral analysis and error estimation of the spectral parameters are performed using _",
    "xspec_. the overall 3 - 60 kev pca - hexte short high spectrum is extracted .",
    "in addition to the overall spectrum , individual pca spectra are extracted in 3 - 20 kev .",
    "[ fig2_herx1 ]    2001 december rxte observation of her x-1 consists of one low state and four short high state orbits with a total exposure of 281.2 ksec .",
    "we extract 111 individual pca spectra in 3 - 20 kev energy range to investigate the spectral evolution throughout the whole dataset . for the individual pca spectra , energies lower than 3 kev",
    "are ignored due to uncertainties in background modeling while energies higher than 20 kev are ignored as a result of poor counting statistics .",
    "then , overall 3 - 60 kev pca - hexte spectrum from the short high state orbits is extracted ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we exclude the 3 - 60 kev spectrum of the low state orbit since the count rate coming from the channels corresponding to @xmath22 kev is not statistically significant for both pca and hexte .",
    "additional 2% systematic error ( see wilms et al .",
    "1999 ; coburn et al .",
    "2000 ) is added to the statistical errors for both the individual spectra and 3 - 60 kev pca - hexte spectrum .",
    "@xmath23    [ fig3_herx1 ]    it is found that the model consisting of an absorbed power law ( morrison & mccammon , 1983 ) with an high energy cut - off ( white , swank , holt 1983 ) and an iron line feature modeled as a gaussian is not able to fit the data well .",
    "this is expected since two component spectral model with a basic emission spectrum and an absorbed component models or partial covering soft absorption models have been found to fit the main high , short high and low state spectrum of her x-1 ( mihara et al .",
    "1991 ; oosterbroek et al . 1997",
    "; coburn et al . 2000 ; oosterbroek et al .",
    "2000 ; choi et al .",
    "1994a , b ; leahy 2001 ) .",
    "we have found that the model containing partial cold absorber ( i.e the model contains both overall absorption represented with the _ wabs _ model and partial absorption represented with the _ pcfabs _ in xspec ) fit the 3 - 20 kev pca spectra well for both low state and short high state parts of the observation .    in table 1 , we present sample results of our spectral fits to low state , peak of short high state , anomalous dip and preeclipse dip data . in figure 3 , we present evolution of spectral parameters during the low state and short high state orbits .",
    "to fit the overall 3 - 60 kev pca - hexte short high state spectrum , we used the same spectral model with an additional cyclotron absorption feature at @xmath24 kev ( table 2 ; figure 2 ) .",
    "her x-1 is the first x - ray pulsar to have shown to have this spectral feature ( truemper et al .",
    "gruber et al . ( 2001 ) showed that the cyclotron resonance energy of her x-1 changed from @xmath25 to @xmath24 kev sometime between 1991 and 1993 .",
    "[ fig4_herx1 ]        we analyzed spectra obtained from continuous rxte monitoring of @xmath0 days of her x-1 .",
    "this rather frequent continuous monitoring , for the first time , enabled the study of the spectral evolution of low state , short high peaks and short high dips within a relatively compact observation period .",
    "for the short high state part , stability of the power law index , cut - off energy and e - folding energy throughout the whole monitoring may be an indication of the fact that accretion geometry and mass accretion rate does not change considerably .",
    "this idea is in accord with the fact that the x - ray flux changes in her x-1 should primarily be due to the opaque obscuration of the pulsar beam , while there should not be no significant variation in the flux emerging initially from the magnetic poles of the pulsar .",
    "we have found some evidences of differences between anomalous dips and preeclipse dips in short high state orbits .",
    "first marginal evidence is the higher ratio of unabsorbed flux to absorbed flux for more than @xmath27% percent of preeclipse dips compared to anomalous dips ( left panel of figure 4 ) . for the rest of the preeclipse dip regions ,",
    "this ratio is similar to that of anomalous dips .",
    "we consider this ratio as a measure of sum of absorptions coming from the total absorption and partial covering absorption ( i.e. greater value of this ratio means more absorption ) .",
    "then , this marginal evidence shows that absorption is more dominant in preeclipse dips compared to anomalous dips .",
    "this result is a confirmation of the previous exosat ( reynolds and parmar 1995 ) and ginga ( leahy 1997 ) results . from exosat observations , it was found that hydrogen column density was about a few times greater in the preeclipse dips compared to that in the anomalous dips , and that partial covering fractions were higher in preeclipse dips compared to those in the anomalous dips .",
    "similarly , ginga observations of the absorption dips revealed that @xmath28 was almost an order higher in the preeclipse dips compared to that in anomalous dips .",
    "this difference of absorption in two types of absorption dips was explained as a sign of the fact that the intersection of the outer rim of the accretion disc with the line of sight is responsible for the both types of absorption dips , and different absorptions for both types of dips is only due to the difference in orbital phase for these dips ( crosa and boynton , 1980 ; leahy 1997 ) .",
    "another evidence supporting this interpretation was the lack of 35 day dependence on the variation of absorption in absorption dips , which is in accord with the fact that the outer edge of the accretion disc , being not responsible of 35 day cycle , should not be affected by 35 day cycle of precession ( leahy 1997 ) . from the left panel of figure 4",
    ", we have also found that unabsorbed flux is higher in anomalous dips compared to preeclipse dips and that the ratio of unabsorbed flux to absorbed flux decreases with increasing unabsorbed flux independently for both preeclipse dips and anomalous dips .",
    "higher unabsorbed flux in anomalous dips is consistent with the general orbital phase dependence of x - ray flux .    on the other hand , decreasing ratio of unabsorbed flux to absorbed flux ( i.e decreasing absorption ) with increasing unabsorbed flux can be understood by the fact that the x - ray flux variation of her x-1 is the result of opaque obscuration rather than soft absorption ( e.g. still et al . 2001 ) .",
    "variations of unabsorbed flux should be primarily due to the change in opaque obscuration .",
    "opaque obscuration is result of either obscuration of the accretion disc or the eclipsing stellar companion .",
    "this relation , therefore , shows that the regions causing opaque obscuration and soft absorption are not geometrically far away from each other .",
    "low states in 35 day cycle of her x-1 is generally believed to be composed of the phases in which x - rays from the neutron star is obscured ( petterson 1975 ; scott & leahy 1999 ; scott , leahy , wilson 2000 ; leahy 2004 ) .",
    "the resultant x - ray flux for both normal low states and anomalous low states is a combination of scattered and reflected components and has been found to fit well except for normalizations and excess absorption to high state spectrum models ( e.g. coburn et al . 2000 ) .",
    "coburn et al . ( 2000 ) also found that absorption can be modeled with a cold partial absorber with @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 and partial covering fraction of @xmath31 for both normal and anomalous low states .",
    "results of our low state fits , giving values @xmath32 @xmath30 and @xmath33 for @xmath28 and partial covering fraction respectively , are in agreement with those results .    from the right panel of figure 4 ,",
    "iron line flux is correlated , in general , with the x - ray flux for both short high state and low state observations .",
    "however , there is a marginal evidence of higher iron line flux for the anomalous dips .",
    "increase in the strength of the iron line feature in the anomalous dips is a natural consequence of the fact that we have some of the x - ray flux coming from the neutron star passing through the outer rim of the accretion disc which is possibly enhancing this iron line feature , so the resultant iron line flux increases in the anomalous dips .",
    "although the origin of the anomalous dips and preeclipse dips are similar , the iron line flux is not significantly higher for the preeclipse dips .",
    "this may be related to orbital phase difference between anomalous dips and preeclipse dips .",
    "future observations of preeclipse dips of her x-1 will be useful to study the variation of iron line feature .",
    "peak energy of the iron line feature is , in general , at @xmath34 kev for the short high state . from figure 3",
    ", the peak energy tends to increase at the initial short high turn - on ( around @xmath35 days ) , anomalous dip of the first short high orbit and preeclipse dips .",
    "the iron line feature is also found to peak at higher energies ( @xmath2 kev ) in the low state .",
    "iron line energy peaking at higher energies is a sign of the fact that this feature does not consist of only the k@xmath4 fe emission line .",
    "in fact , it has recently been noted that k@xmath4 fe line emission tends to be less powerful in short high and low states compared to the main high state ( zane et al . 2004 ) .",
    "zane et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , using xmm - newton observations , also has been able to resolve a secondary iron line feature ( fe xxvi ) peaking at @xmath36 kev which is present only in low state and short high state .",
    "spectral resolution of rxte - pca is not good enough to resolve these lines but the higher peak energies of the resultant iron line feature may be a clue of the presence of iron line components other than k@xmath4 emission line .",
