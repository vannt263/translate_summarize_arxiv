    "in recent years , computer simulations have increasingly been used to study the nucleation and growth of crystals from the supercooled liquid state .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations have been particularly useful in testing , on a molecular level , the predictions of classical nucleation theory ( cnt )  @xcite . in large measure ,",
    "this has been made possible by the development of novel computational techniques that permit the determination , from simulations , of free energy barriers , kinetic prefactors , and the order parameters required to quantitatively test the predictions of cnt  @xcite .",
    "a key feature of these techniques is that they allow the study of nucleation under thermodynamic conditions at which spontaneous crystal nucleation does not occur on the short physical time scales accessible to conventional md simulations . as a consequence",
    ", much previous work has focussed on testing cnt , and calculating the nulcleation rate , at low to intermediate degrees of supercooling , where cnt is expected to best apply .    at the same time",
    ", spontaneous crystal nucleation is observed in a number of simulated liquid systems under very highly supercooled conditions where the nucleation time is comparable to or less than the simulation time scale ( e.g. refs .",
    "current conventional md simulations typically are able to study systems of a few thousand molecules over a time scale of tens of nanoseconds . within these restrictions",
    ", a spontaneously crystallizing system will exhibit quite small crystal nuclei compared to those found at higher temperature @xmath4 , and it is generally expected that cnt will not predict well the behavior of the system in this regime . consequently , relatively few studies examine this deeply supercooled limit of nucleation behavior in the context of cnt .    the purpose of the present work is to explore this deeply supercooled limit of nucleation behavior , with the goal of testing the limits of cnt and quantifying how the theory begins to fail in this regime ; and also to determine the technical limits of applicability of the simulation methods usually employed at higher @xmath4 .",
    "we are interested in determining if it is possible to compare a nucleation rate calculated using cnt , and a rate found directly from a spontaneously crystallizing md simulation .",
    "the latter question is particularly interesting , since only a few simulation studies compare nucleation rates found from cnt to a rate calculated independently  @xcite , yet such comparisons are a key tool for developing and testing improved theoretical descriptions of nucleation .    to achieve these goals",
    ", we study liquid silica as modelled by the bks potential  @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic and transport properties of the supercooled liquid state of this model have been characterized in detail  @xcite .",

    "most significant for the current purpose , we find that the liquid spontaneously crystallizes to stishovite  @xcite in our simulations when cooled to approximately @xmath2  k at density @xmath0  g/@xmath1 .",
    "the liquid at this @xmath4 exhibits the two - step relaxation in its dynamical quantities characteristic of a deeply supercooled fluid , but it is still diffusive enough to reach metastable equilibrium on a time scale much shorter than the time scale for crystal nucleation .",
    "consequently , we are able to make a direct calculation of the rate at @xmath13  k using an ensemble of independent md simulations , while at the same time , we can determine the properties of the metastable liquid .",
    "we also use constrained monte carlo simulations of the liquid to calculate the free energy barrier to nucleation at the same density , over a range of temperatures from @xmath13  k to @xmath9  k , to test the degree to which the predictions of cnt are satisfied on approach to @xmath2  k. the key predictions of cnt we wish to test relate to the central quantity of the theory , @xmath15 , the equilibrium cluster size distribution , or the number of clusters containing @xmath6 particles @xcite . in this work , we will track si atoms only , and assume from stoichiometry that a cluster nominally of size @xmath6 ( @xmath6 si atoms ) actually contains @xmath16 atoms ( @xmath6 si atoms and @xmath17 o atoms ) .",

    ", we err on the side of making @xmath86 a lower bound on the nucleation time .",
    "thus , we have three measures of the nucleation time : the time @xmath79 it takes to reach a potential energy @xmath89 indicative of the beginning of crystallization ; the time it takes to reach a low energy threshold @xmath84 ; and the last time @xmath86 at which the system possesses a largest cluster of size @xmath41 .    to    fig .",

    "the slope of the line of best fit is @xmath97  ns@xmath59 , where we have omitted data from times before @xmath41  ns in the fit , and the time lag @xmath98  ns .",

    "we also note that in about @xmath110 of the runs , the @xmath81 criterion is triggered prematurely , i.e. , a low - energy fluctuation goes below @xmath81 , but then the system energy remains in steady state .",
    "we note that calculating the rate directly from the slope of the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate ] may ignore effects due to transient nucleation , i.e. that @xmath90 decreases smoothly at early times instead of remaining at @xmath41 until @xmath111  @xcite , so that our estimate of the rate and lag times are strictly lower bounds .",

    "however , it is not feasible to obtain @xmath15 through direct simulation for two reasons : critical clusters are typically rare , and hence it is difficult to gain statistics ; and after the formation of the critical cluster , the system irreversibly evolves toward the crystalline state . to overcome this , we add a bias to the system hamiltonian which constrains the clusters of interest into existence .",

    "formally , this occurs when clusters are rare , and can be justified by the following .",
    "let @xmath125 be the probability that there is at least one cluster of size @xmath6 in the system , and @xmath126 be the probability that there are exactly @xmath127 clusters of size @xmath6 .",

    "this immediately leads to @xmath132  @xcite . by extension ,",
    "two rare clusters of different sizes appearing at the same time also occurs with vanishing probability @xmath133 [ assuming @xmath134 for @xmath135 , i.e. larger clusters are rarer ] , and so a rare cluster will also be the largest cluster in the system . from these arguments ,",

    "<S> we test classical nucleation theory ( cnt ) in the case of simulations of deeply supercooled , high density liquid silica , as modelled by the bks potential . </S>",
    "<S> we find that at density @xmath0  g/@xmath1 , spontaneous nucleation of crystalline stishovite occurs in conventional molecular dynamics simulations at temperature @xmath2  k , and we evaluate the nucleation rate @xmath3 directly at this @xmath4 via `` brute force '' sampling of nucleation events in numerous independent runs . </S>",
    "<S> we then use parallel , constrained monte carlo simulations to evaluate @xmath5 , the free energy to form a crystalline embryo containing @xmath6 silicon atoms , at @xmath2 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9  k. by comparing the form of @xmath5 to cnt , we test the ability of cnt to reproduce the observed behavior as we approach the regime where spontaneous nucleation occurs on simulation time scales . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the prediction of cnt for the @xmath6-dependence of @xmath5 fits reasonably well to the data at all @xmath4 studied . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 , the chemical potential difference between bulk liquid and stishovite , is evaluated as a fit parameter in our analysis of the form of @xmath5 . compared to directly determined values of @xmath10 extracted from previous work , </S>",
    "<S> the fitted values agree only at @xmath11  k ; at lower @xmath4 the fitted values increasingly overestimate @xmath10 as @xmath4 decreases . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath12 , the size of the critical nucleus , is approximately 10 silicon atoms at @xmath11  k. at @xmath13  k , @xmath12 decreases to approximately 3 , and at such small sizes methodological challenges arise in the evaluation of @xmath5 when using standard techniques ; indeed even the thermodynamic stability of the supercooled liquid comes into question under these conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore present a modified approach that permits an estimation of @xmath5 at @xmath13  k. finally , we directly evaluate at @xmath2  k the kinetic prefactors in the cnt expression for @xmath3 , and find physically reasonable values ; e.g. the diffusion length that si atoms must travel in order to move from the liquid to the crystal embryo is approximately 0.2  nm . we are thereby able to compare the results for @xmath3 at @xmath13  k obtained both directly and based on cnt , and find that they agree within an order of magnitude . in sum </S>",
    "<S> , our work quantifies how certain predictions of cnt ( e.g. for @xmath10 ) break down in this deeply supercooled limit , while others [ the @xmath6-dependence of @xmath5 ] are not as adversely affected . </S>"
