    "to extract precise information on the size of cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements from @xmath15 mixing measurements , the  decay constants \" for @xmath16 and @xmath17 mesons or their ratio , @xmath18 , must be well known @xcite .",
    "these factors are related to the overlap of the heavy and light quark wave - functions at zero spatial separation .",
    "indeed , the recent measurement of @xmath19 mixing by cdf @xcite that can now be compared to the very well measured @xmath20 mixing @xcite has pointed out the urgent need for precise values @xcite .",
    "decay constants have been calculated theoretically .",
    "the most promising of these calculations are based on lattice - gauge theory that includes light quark loops @xcite , often called  unquenched . \" in order to ensure that these theories can adequately predict @xmath21 it is useful to check the analogous ratio in charm decays @xmath22 .",
    "we have previously measured @xmath23 @xcite . here",
    "we present the most precise measurement to date of @xmath2 and the ratio @xmath24 .    in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "the only way for a @xmath25 meson to decay purely leptonically is via annihilation through a virtual @xmath26 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ dstomunu ] .",
    "the decay rate is given by @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the @xmath29 mass , @xmath30 is the mass of the charged final state lepton , @xmath31 is the fermi coupling constant , and @xmath32 is a cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix element with a value we take equal to 0.9738 @xcite .",
    "0.00 cm    = 3.0 in    in this paper we analyze both @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 . in both @xmath25",
    "decays the charged lepton must be produced with the wrong helicity because the @xmath25 is a spin-0 particle , and the final state consists of a naturally left - handed spin-1/2 neutrino and a naturally right - handed spin-1/2 anti - lepton . because the @xmath6 has a mass close to that of the @xmath29 , the helicity suppression is broken with respect to the @xmath5 decay , but there is an additional large phase space suppression .",
    "new physics can affect the expected widths ; any undiscovered charged bosons would interfere with the sm @xmath26 .",
    "these effects may be difficult to ascertain , since they would simply change the value of the decay constants .",
    "the ratio @xmath24 is much better predicted in the sm than the values individually , so deviations from the the sm expectation are more easily seen .",
    "any such discrepancies would point to beyond the sm charged bosons .",
    "for example , akeroyd predicts that the presence of a charged higgs boson would suppress this ratio significantly @xcite .",
    "we can also measure the ratio of decay rates to different leptons , and the sm predictions then are fixed only by well - known masses .",
    "for example , for @xmath36 to @xmath37 :    @xmath38    using measured masses @xcite , this expression yields a value of 9.72 with a negligibly small error .",
    "any deviation in @xmath39 from the value predicted by eq .",
    "[ eq : tntomu ] would be a manifestation of physics beyond the sm .",
    "this could occur if any other charged intermediate boson existed that affected the decay rate differently than mass - squared .",
    "then the couplings would be different for muons and @xmath40 s .",
    "this would be a clear violation of lepton universality @xcite .",
    "previous measurements of @xmath2 have been hampered by a lack of statistical precision , and relatively large systematic errors @xcite .",
    "one large systematic error source has been the lack of knowledge of the absolute branching fraction of the normalization channel , usually @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the results we report here will not have this limitation .",
    "the cleo - c detector @xcite is equipped to measure the momenta and directions of charged particles , identify them using specific ionization ( @xmath42 ) and cherenkov light ( rich ) @xcite , detect photons and determine their directions and energies .",
    "in this study we use 314 pb@xmath43 of data produced in @xmath44 collisions using the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) and recorded near a center - of - mass energy ( @xmath45 ) of 4.170 gev . at this energy",
    "the @xmath44 annihilation cross - section into @xmath46+@xmath47 is approximately 1  nb , while the cross - section for @xmath48 is about a factor of 20 smaller . in addition , @xmath49 mesons are produced mostly as @xmath50 , with a cross - section of @xmath515  nb , and also in @xmath52 final states with a cross - section of @xmath512 nb . the @xmath53 cross - section is a relatively small @xmath510.2 nb @xcite .",
    "there also appears to be @xmath54 production .",
    "the underlying light quark  continuum \" background is about 12 nb .",
    "the relatively large cross - sections , relatively large branching fractions and sufficient luminosities allow us to fully reconstruct one @xmath25 as a  tag , \" and examine the properties of the other . in this paper",
    "we designate the tag as a @xmath55 and examine the leptonic decays of the @xmath29 , though , in reality , we use both charges for tags and signals .",
    "track requirements , particle identification , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 selection criteria are the same as those described in ref .",
    "@xcite , except that we now require a minimum momentum of 700 mev / c for a track to be identified using the rich .",
    "we also use several resonances that decay via the strong interaction . here",
    "we select intervals in invariant mass within @xmath5910 mev of the known mass for @xmath60 , @xmath5910 mev for @xmath61 , @xmath59100 mev for @xmath62 , and @xmath59150 mev for @xmath63 .",
    "we reconstruct tags from either directly produced @xmath25 mesons or those that result from the decay of a @xmath64 .",
    "the beam constrained mass , @xmath65 , is formed by using the beam energy to construct the @xmath25 candidate mass via the formula @xmath66 where @xmath67 runs over all the final state particles .",

    "note that the resolution in invariant mass is excellent , and the backgrounds not abysmally large , at least in these modes . to determine the number of @xmath55 events we fit the invariant mass distributions to the sum of two gaussians centered at the @xmath55 mass , a function we refer to as  two - gaussian . \"",
