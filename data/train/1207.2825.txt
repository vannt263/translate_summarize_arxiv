    "direct - sequence code - division multiple - access ( ds - cdma ) ad hoc networks are realized by using direct - sequence spread - spectrum modulation while the mobiles or nodes of multiple users simultaneously transmit signals in the same frequency band .",
    "all signals use the entire allocated spectrum , but the spreading sequences differ .",
    "ds - cdma is advantageous for ad hoc networks because it eliminates the need for any frequency or time - slot coordination , imposes no sharp upper bound on the number of mobiles , directly benefits from inactive terminals in the network , and is capable of exploiting bursty data traffic , intermittent voice signals , multibeamed arrays , and reassignments to accommodate variable data rates .",
    "furthermore , ds - cdma systems are inherently resistant to interference , interception , and frequency - selective fading .",
    "the central issue in ds - cdma ad hoc networks is the prevention of a near - far problem .",
    "the solution to the near - far problem in cellular networks is power control @xcite .",
    "however , the absence of a centralized control of an ad hoc network renders any attempted power control local rather than pervasive . as an alternative to power control ,",
    "ad hoc networks typically use _ guard zones _ surrounding mobiles to manage interference .",
    "this paper considers two types of guard zones to control the near - far problem : a fundamental _ exclusion zone _ and an additional guard zone that may be established by the carrier - sense multiple - access ( csma ) protocol ; i.e. , a _",
    "csma guard zone_. in the exclusion zone surrounding a mobile , no other mobiles are physically present .",
    "the exclusion zone may be enforced by using information about the locations of a mobile and its surrounding mobiles and is justified by the fact that mobiles will always have a minimum physical separation in actual networks . in the csma guard zone @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , which extends beyond the exclusion zone , other mobiles may be present , but they are deactivated by the protocol .",
    "the csma guard zone offers additional near - far protection beyond that offered by the exclusion zone , but at the cost of reduced network transmission capacity , as shown subsequently .",
    "in contrast to the existing literature ( e.g. , @xcite-@xcite and the references therein ) , a realistic network of finite extent with a finite number of mobiles and uniform clustering as the spatial distribution is modeled . the analysis presented in this paper discards previous assumptions based on stochastic geometry @xcite , @xcite about the spatial distribution of the mobiles . both the spatial extent of the network and number of mobiles are finite , and each mobile has an arbitrary location .",
    "the analysis considers the mobile s duty factor , the shadowing , the possible coordination among the mobiles ( through the use of guard zones ) , and a nakagami - m factor that can vary among the channels from each mobile to the reference receiver . a recent closed - form expression for the _ exact _",
    "outage probability @xcite is used for a reference receiver conditioned on the network geometry and shadowing factors .",
    "the _ spatially averaged outage probability _ , defined as the average over both the mobile locations and the shadowing , is computed by averaging the conditional outage probability with respect to the spatial distribution and the distribution of the shadowing . while this expectation is not generally analytically tractable for finite networks and guard zones , a simple and efficient monte carlo method can be used that involves the random placement of mobiles and generation of shadowing factors , but does not require the generation of fading coefficients",
    "the ieee 802.11 standard , which is currently the predominant standard for ad hoc networks , uses csma with collision avoidance in its medium - access control protocol @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the implementation entails the exchange of request - to - send ( rts ) and clear - to - send ( cts ) handshake packets between a transmitter and receiver during their initial phase of communication that precedes the subsequent data and acknowledgment packets .",
    "the receipt of the rts / cts packets with sufficient power levels by nearby mobiles causes them to inhibit their own transmissions , which would produce interference in the receiver of interest .",
    "the transmission of separate cts packets in addition to the rts packets decreases the possibility of subsequent signal collisions at the receiver due to nearby hidden terminals that do not sense the rts packets .",
    "thus , the rts / cts packets essentially establish guard zones surrounding a transmitter and receiver , and hence , prevent a near - far problem except during the initial reception of an rts packet .",
    "the interference at the receiver is restricted to concurrent transmissions generated by mobiles outside the guard zones .",
    "the fundamental disadvantage with this csma guard zone is that it inhibits other concurrent transmissions within the zone .    a more fundamental guard zone , which is called the _ exclusion zone _ ,",
    "is based on the spacing that usually occurs in actual mobile networks .",
    "for instance , when the radios are mounted on vehicles , there is a need for crash avoidance by maintaining a minimum vehicle separation .",
    "a small exclusion zone maintained by visual sightings exists in practical networks , but a more reliable and extensive one can be established by equipping each mobile with a global positioning system ( gps ) and periodically broadcasting each mobile s gps coordinates .",
    "mobiles that receive those messages could compare their locations to that in the message and alter their movements accordingly .",
    "the major advantage of the exclusion zone compared with a csma guard zone is that the exclusion zone prevents near - far problems at receivers while not inhibiting any potential concurrent transmissions .",
    "another advantage of an exclusion zone is enhanced network connectivity because of the inherent constraint on the clustering of mobiles .    when csma is used in a network",
    ", the csma guard zone will usually encompass the exclusion zone .",
    "although both zones may cover arbitrary regions , they are modeled as circular regions in the subsequent examples for computational convenience , and the region of the csma guard zone that lies outside the exclusion zone is an annular ring .",
    "the existence of an annular ring enhances the near - far protection at the cost of inhibiting potential concurrent transmissions within the annular ring .",
    "the tradeoffs entailed in having the csma guard zone are examined subsequently .",
    "the network comprises a fixed number of mobiles in a circular area with radius @xmath0 , although any arbitrary two- or three - dimensional regions could be considered .",
    "a reference receiver is located inside the circle , a reference transmitter @xmath1 is located at distance @xmath2 from the reference receiver , and there are @xmath3 potentially interfering mobiles @xmath4 the variable @xmath5 represents both the @xmath6 mobile and its location , and @xmath7 is the distance from the @xmath6 mobile to the receiver . each mobile uses a single omnidirectional antenna .",
    "the radii of the exclusion zone and the csma guard zone are @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "the interfering mobiles are uniformly distributed throughout the network area outside the exclusion zones , according to a _ uniform clustering _ model .",
    "one by one , the location of each @xmath10 is drawn according to a uniform distribution within the radius-@xmath0 circle . however , if an @xmath10 falls within the exclusion zone of a previously placed mobile , then it has a new random location assigned to it as many times as necessary until it falls outside all exclusion zones .",
    "unlike matern thinning @xcite , which silences mobiles without replacing them , uniform clustering maintains a fixed number of active mobiles .    since there is no significant advantage to using short direct - sequence sequences , long spreading sequences are assumed and modeled as random binary sequences with chip duration @xmath11 .",
    "the processing gain or spreading factor @xmath12 directly reduces the interference power .",
    "the multiple - access interference is assumed to be asynchronous , and the power from each interfering @xmath5 is further reduced by the chip factor @xmath13 , which is a function of the chip waveform and the timing offset @xmath14 of @xmath5 s spreading sequence relative to that of the desired signal @xcite . in a network of quadriphase direct - sequence systems , a multiple - access interference signal with power @xmath15 before despreading is reduced after despreading to the power level @xmath16 where @xcite , @xcite @xmath17\\ ] ] and @xmath18 is the partial autocorrelation for the normalized chip waveform .",
    "thus , the interference power is effectively reduced by the factor @xmath19 assuming a rectangular chip waveform and that @xmath14 has a uniform distribution over [ 0 , @xmath20,$ ] the expected value of @xmath13 is 2/3 .",
    "after despreading , the power of @xmath5 s signal at the reference receiver is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the received power at a reference distance @xmath23 ( assumed to be sufficiently far that the signals are in the far field ) after despreading when fading and shadowing are absent , @xmath24 is the power gain due to fading , @xmath25 is a shadowing coefficient , and @xmath26 is a path - loss function . the path - loss function is expressed as the power law @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the path - loss exponent .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath29 the \\{@xmath30 are independent with unit - mean , but are not necessarily identically distributed ; i.e. , the channels from the different @xmath31 to the reference receiver may undergo fading with different distributions",
    ". for analytical tractability and close agreement with measured fading statistics , nakagami fading is assumed , and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is nakagami with parameter @xmath34 .",
    "when the channel between @xmath5 and the reference receiver undergoes rayleigh fading , @xmath35 and the corresponding @xmath24 is exponentially distributed . in the presence of log - normal shadowing ,",
    "the @xmath36 are independent zero - mean gaussian with variance @xmath37 .",
    "for ease of exposition , it is assumed that the shadowing variance is the same for the entire network , but the results may be easily generalized to allow for different shadowing variances over parts of the network . in the absence of shadowing , @xmath38 .",
    "it is assumed that the \\{@xmath30 remain fixed for the duration of a time interval , but vary independently from interval to interval ( block fading ) . with probability @xmath39 ,",
    "the @xmath6 mobile transmits in the same time interval as the desired signal .",
    "the @xmath40 can be used to model voice - activity factors , controlled silence , or failed link transmissions and the resulting retransmission attempts .",
    "the @xmath40 need not be the same ; for instance , csma protocols can be modeled by setting @xmath41 when a mobile lies within the csma guard zone of another active mobile , which is equivalent to implementing matern thinning within the annular ring corresponding to that guard zone .    the instantaneous signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio ( sinr ) at the receiver",
    "is given by : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the received power of the desired signal , @xmath44 is the noise power , and the indicator @xmath45 is a bernoulli random variable with probability @xmath46=p_{i}$ ] and @xmath47=1-p_{i}$ ] .",
    "since the despreading does not affect the desired - signal power , the substitution of ( [ power ] ) and ( [ pathloss ] ) into ( [ sinr1 ] ) yields @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the normalized power of @xmath5 , @xmath50 is the received power at the reference distance @xmath23 before despreading when fading and shadowing are absent , and @xmath51 is the snr when the reference transmitter is at unit distance from the reference receiver and fading and shadowing are absent .",
