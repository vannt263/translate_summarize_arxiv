    "this very efficient transfer occurs on a time - scale of few hundreds of picoseconds and on a length - scale of few nanometers , so that coherent quantum dynamics can enter the play , as recent experiments seem to prove  @xcite .",
    "quantum coherence can enhance transport efficiency inducing supertransfer and superradiance in light - harvesting complexes  @xcite . on the other hand , quantum coherence can also be detrimental to transport , as anderson localization  @xcite and the presence of trapping - free subspaces  @xcite show .",
    "superradiance  @xcite , as viewed in the context of both optical fluorescence @xcite and quantum transport in open systems @xcite , is not solely a many - body effect .",
    "single - excitation superradiance is a prominent example of genuinely quantum cooperative effect  @xcite , relevant in natural complexes , which operate in the single excitation regime since solar light is very dilute .",
    "natural complexes are subject to a noisy environment with different correlation time - scales ( if compared to the excitonic transport time ) : ( i ) short - time correlations , giving rise to dephasing ( homogeneous broadening , as considered e.g.   in @xcite ) and ( ii ) long - time correlations , producing on - site static disorder ( inhomogeneous broadening , as considered e.g.  in @xcite ) . following a common nomenclature",
    ", we will refer to the former effect as dephasing noise and to the latter as static disorder .",
    "the role of environment is twofold : on one hand , it can help transport since it destroys the detrimental coherent effects , leading to noise - enhanced energy transfer , i.e.  the existence of a maximal efficiency at some intermediate noise strength , as found in the last decade by various groups @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it can suppress the beneficial coherences leading to a quenching of supertransfer  @xcite .",
    "it is thus essential to consider this non - trivial interplay .",
    "typical structures of bacterial photosynthetic complexes display a rc placed at the center of the light - harvesting complex i ( lhi ) , with the chromophores arranged on a ring and surrounded by other ring structures ( called lhii ) acting as peripheral antennae .",
    "the lhi - rc structure describing light - harvesting complexes produces a distinguished feature : the eigenstates of the peripheral ring structure can be separated into two classes , superradiant and subradiant states , with respect to the transfer of excitation towards the rc . in absence of both environmental noise and static disorder ,",
    "the superradiant states are coupled to the rc with a coupling amplitude proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of chromophores in the ring , while subradiant states are basically decoupled from the rc . in presence of disorder ,",
    "the subradiant states can be coupled to the superradiant ones and , as a consequence , only indirectly coupled to the rc states .",
    "note that the subradiant subspace , previously studied by the authors  @xcite , has been also analyzed in the literature under the name of trapping - free subspace  @xcite .",
    "the optimization of excitation transfer efficiency from peripheral states in networks displaying the ring - rc structure is a rather difficult problem , even for a network as simple as a trimer . despite its simplicity",
    ", the trimer model has been discussed in several papers as a paradigmatic model @xcite . in particular , in  @xcite various optimal conditions are explored in simple few - site networks in the presence of dephasing noise but without static disorder .",
    "since it is difficult to clarify generic physical effects by studying specific natural systems , we rather investigate the simplest model for quantum transport that displays the features mentioned above : a disordered trimer with a superradiant and a subradiant state , on which the excitation is initialized , along with an acceptor state ( the rc ) , where the excitation can be trapped , see fig .",
    "[ trimer]a .",
    "we believe this to be an essential step towards understanding the basic mechanism of transfer optimization in more complex networks .    here",
    "we discuss the optimization of excitation transfer efficiency when the excitation is initially prepared on a subradiant state rather than on a single site , as is usually done .",
    "there are two main reasons for considering transport from a subradiant initial condition , related to the presence of noise and disorder : ( i ) the thermalization processes , typically at place in natural complexes , such as the lhi - rc of purple bacteria , tend to populate the lowest - energy levels , which include both superradiant and subradiant states with respect to the rc and to the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "( ii ) in absence of any noise , subradiant states do not contribute to transport efficiency .",
    "the presence of moderate static disorder hinders super- and sub - radiance , causing subradiant states to become significantly open to transport .",
    "hence , a moderate disorder increases the transport efficiency of subradiant states . at the same time , a very large disorder ultimately prevents transport , due to anderson localization .",
    "since disorder is only detrimental for superradiant states , the overall optimization of transfer is determined by the behavior of subradiant states .    to pursue our goal , in section",
    "[ sec : trimer ] we present our trimer model . in fig .",
    "[ trimer]b , the trimer is shown in the super - subradiant basis to stress the following features : in the absence of disorder , while the subradiant state is decoupled from the rc , the superradiant state has an enhanced coupling @xmath2 to the rc .",
    "we discuss the maximization of the average ( over disorder ) transfer efficiency with respect to both the detuning @xmath3 between initial subradiant state and rc and the strength @xmath4 of disorder .",
    "we have found two different regimes depending on @xmath2 and the energy gap @xmath5 between the subradiant and superradiant states .",
    "the optimal detuning is achieved when the energy of the rc is at resonance with the initial state ( subradiant ) for @xmath6 , while we have found a less trivial optimal detuning , namely @xmath7 , in the case @xmath8 .",
    "this can be interpreted as a resonant condition between dressed states . concerning the optimal disorder , we have found that it is always of the order of @xmath2 , if @xmath2 is larger or comparable with @xmath5 , while it is smaller when @xmath9 .",
    "we analyze in section [ sec : dephasing ] how our findings are affected by dephasing .",
    "since our aim is to analyze in detail a very simplified model , we include in a paradigmatic way the effects of a dephasing environment , adopting the haken  strobl model @xcite .",
    "such an effective master equation assumes white - noise fluctuations of the site energies , thereby implying a high - temperature limit . even if it is possible to consider more refined phononic baths , they are not necessary here due to the simplicity of our model . moreover , they have been found to give results that are qualitatively similar to those obtained with the haken ",
    "strobl approach @xcite .",
    "we show that dynamical noise induces an additional resonance peak when the rc energy is equal to the energy of the superradiant state .",
    "indeed , the incoherent path opened by dephasing favours transport between those states which are directly coupled , making the final hopping between the superradiant state and the rc the key passage of the transport process . by contrast , the coherent resonance condition found in the absence of dephasing takes into account the interference effects which are present in the system as a whole , emphasizing the role of the initial condition in determining the transport efficiency .",

    "[ trimer]b , implies that the excitation transfer from the subradiant state to the rc can only be mediated by the superradiant state , through the random coupling @xmath32 . in this basis",
    ", the trimer model subradiant - superradiant - rc corresponds to a donor - bridge - acceptor ( dba ) system without direct coupling between the donor and the acceptor and with a random coupling between donor and bridge and a random acceptor energy . in spite of the fact that similar systems have been widely studied in literature",
    ", the analysis developed in the present article concerning the optimization of the decay of an excitation , initialized on the donor state and dissipated at the level of the acceptor state , with the stochastic terms considered here , appears to be new , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "more importantly , our analysis lies outside the regime of validity of perturbation theory , which is used within the superexchange mechanism @xcite to study these systems .",
    "indeed , the superexchange mechanism can be applied only when the donor  bridge coupling is much smaller than the donor  bridge energy detuning ( in our case this detuning can be even zero ) .",
    "a most important quantity for such an analysis ( motivated by the study of light - harvesting complexes but also relevant in a general context ) is the efficiency , at the time @xmath33 , of energy transfer from the system into the rc .",

    "thus , one might think that the best situation occurs when the excitation is on the superradiant state set at resonance with the energy of the rc .",
    "in this situation disorder is only detrimental to transport , since it tends to destroy the superradiant coupling  @xcite and it moves the system out of resonance . on the other side ,",
    "the excitation in natural complexes is usually spread also on subradiant states , due to the presence of a thermal bath . since a subradiant state is not directly coupled to the rc , it is only through the action of disorder that the excitation can be transferred from the initial state to the rc ( i.e.  for @xmath43 , we have @xmath44 )",

    "a second important resonance at @xmath134 appears ( indicated by a dashed horizontal white line ) .",
    "this resonance , absent for small dephasing , corresponds to the rc energy being equal to the energy of the superradiant state . even if our previous estimate of optimal disorder still lies between the curves enclosing the regions of @xmath132 and @xmath90 below the maximal efficiency ( blue circle in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : delta20-v10b ] ) , the structure of the contour lines is very different for two reasons : ( i ) transport is strongly enhanced by dephasing for small disorder ; ( ii ) due to the additional broad resonance at @xmath134 , we have two resonance peaks instead of one ( compare panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : delta20-v10b ] ) . for a larger dephasing noise ,",
    "only the broad resonance at @xmath134 remains .",
    "we can thus conclude that the resonance @xmath88 , given by  , coexists , in the presence of small dephasing , with another resonance at @xmath135 , which eventually dominates the dynamics for large dephasing .",
    "the latter condition shows that , even if we start from the subradiant state , the incoherent dynamics generated by dephasing rests upon the direct transfer to the rc from the superradiant state , since the latter is continuously populated by the action of dephasing .",
    "this is at variance with the coherent resonance conditions found in the previous section .",
    "we considered a paradigmatic model of quantum network , namely a trimer in which two sites are coupled to a third site , representing a reaction center where the excitation can be trapped .",
    "the optimal conditions of energy transfer are analyzed in presence of different kind of disturbances : static disorder and dynamical noise . in similar networks",
    "the states can be classified as superradiant or subradiant , based on how they transfer the excitation into the reaction center .",
    "subradiant states are not directly coupled to the reaction center , but static on - site disorder can effectively couple them with superradiant states .",
    "this opens an indirect path for the transfer of excitation from subradiant states to the reaction center , mediated by the superradiant state .",
    "the static disorder which activates the transfer from subradiant states , when too strong , hinders transport , so that an optimal disorder condition can be determined .",
    "we analyze in detail such a model .",
    "four parameters determine the different regimes in which the trimer can operate : the energy distance @xmath5 between the subradiant and the superradiant state , the intensity @xmath4 of static disorder , which induces a random coupling between subradiant and superradiant states , the direct coupling @xmath2 between the superradiant state and the reaction center , and the detuning @xmath3 between the subradiant initial state and the reaction center .",
    "the origin of conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) can be synthetically expressed as follows .",
    "the disorder strength @xmath4 determines the amplitude of the coupling between the subradiant donor state ( d ) and the superradiant bridge state ( b ) , while @xmath2 is the coupling between the superradiant bridge state ( b ) and the rc acceptor state ( a ) .",
    "thus the condition @xmath136 implies a symmetry between the d  b and b  a couplings , which optimizes transport .",
    "moreover , the condition @xmath62 corresponds to a donor and an acceptor with the same energy , which also helps transport in a coherent regime . on the other hand , when @xmath139 , the stochastic nature of the d ",
    "b coupling induces a shift of the optimal detuning , which is now determined by the presence , for small values of the d  b coupling , of a sharp resonance in the transfer efficiency at @xmath138 .    regarding the effect of dynamical noise ( modeled as pure dephasing ) on the various coherent features we analyze ,",
    "we show that our condition for the optimal disorder is still valid for a not too strong dephasing . on the other hand ,",
    "the optimal detuning can be strongly modified , since dephasing produces an additional resonance peak , corresponding to the superadiant bridge energy being equal to that of the rc acceptor .",
    "such peak coexists with the one obtained via the coherent resonance conditions given above . dephasing produces a general enhancement of the transfer efficiency for small disorder , providing also a significant stability with respect to the energy detuning @xmath3 .",
    "we believe that the principles of our analysis , even if it has been carried out on a very simple model , are relevant to all those quantum networks in which a subradiant ( or trapping - free ) subspace is present . specifically , we think that the interplay of an incoherent resonant condition with a coherent one is a generic feature of those quantum networks aimed at modeling realistic light - harvesting complexes , such as ring structures with a trapping site at their center akin to those observed in natural lhi complexes .    especially to understand the enhancement in transport due to disorder , which is ubiquitous in natural light - harvesting complexes , it is necessary to go beyond the standard perturbative analysis , since the coupling between peripheral sites and the reaction center is coherently enhanced by superradiance , producing a nontrivial interplay with the various sources of noise and disorder .",

    "<S> static on - site disorder induces a coupling between subradiant and superradiant states , thus creating an indirect coupling to the rc . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of finding the optimal transfer conditions , as a function of both the rc energy and the disorder strength , is very complex even in the simplest network , namely a three - level system . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we analyze such trimeric structure choosing as initial condition an excitation on a subradiant state , rather than the more common choice of an excitation localized on a single site . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , while the optimal disorder is of the order of the superradiant coupling , the optimal detuning between the initial state and the rc energy strongly depends on system parameters : when the superradiant coupling is much larger than the energy gap between the superradiant and the subradiant levels , optimal transfer occurs if the rc energy is at resonance with the subradiant initial state , whereas we find an optimal rc energy at resonance with a virtual dressed state when the superradiant coupling is smaller than or comparable with the gap . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of dynamical noise , which induces dephasing and decoherence , affects the resonance structure of energy transfer producing an additional `` incoherent '' resonance peak , which corresponds to the rc energy being equal to the energy of the superradiant state . </S>"
