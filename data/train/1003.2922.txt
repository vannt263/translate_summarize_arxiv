    "dynamical mechanisms that stabilize cooperation have intrigued scientists from different fields for many decades , and evolutionary game theory has developed from a coining metaphor to a well - established research area with a wide range of applications from biology to behaviour @xcite .",
    "an analogous question addresses the dynamical mechanisms that can stabilize coexistence of ( biological ) species or ( behavioral ) strategies @xcite . in a biological context : how is biodiversity sustained ? here , cyclic coevolution has been suggested as to support the coexistence of strategies @xcite .",
    "but it already has been reported that cyclic dominance alone is not enough to stabilize coexistence of strategies @xcite . while space ( or , in ecological setting , niches ) provides a means of stabilizing biodiversity , it is not the only mechanism to be taken into account .",
    "one additional way of stabilization is the introduction of a non - zero sum game , which also can stabilize finite but sufficiently large populations @xcite and results in an exponential scaling of the mean first extinction time @xcite .",
    "in general , the stability of the coexistence fixed point depends on several instances : firstly , on the payoff matrix @xcite , secondly , on the population size and the underlying evolutionary process @xcite , and thirdly , on the spatial structure of the population which can assume interaction topologies with the structure of a lattice or more general graphs .",
    "a spatial discretization of coevolutionary dynamics can lead to a stabilization of the coexistence of game theoretical strategies , compared to well mixed populations @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the effect of spatial discretization in 2-strategy games , where  despite exceptions @xcite  cooperative strategies can be stabilized @xcite . in this direction",
    ", many works deal with structured versions of the prisoners dilemma @xcite , where it has been shown that cooperators can coexist with defectors even in parameter regions where cooperation will never be observed in mixed populations @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these two - strategy evolutionary games , here we analyze the widely known rock - paper - scissors game ( rps ) which includes three strategies with cyclic dominance .",
    "such three - strategy models including cyclic dominance are well - known in game theory and related fields @xcite . in a spatially extended system , the coexistence of the three cyclically invading strategies is stabilized , even in cases where it is not stabilized in the well - mixed system @xcite .  but how strong is this stabilization ?",
    "are there differences between the stabilization effect on different graphs and for different processes ?",
    "how does the population size influence the stabilization ? to answer these questions ,",
    "in this paper we examine three different update mechanisms  the frequency - dependent moran process @xcite , the local update process @xcite , and a process adapted from szolnoki , perc , and danku @xcite  and a broad range of complex network types as underlying structures , and , for each network type , analyze the mean extinction time ( _ met _ ) , i.e.  the average time until one of the three strategies has gone extinct .",
    "we consider a population of @xmath0 individuals or agents .",
    "@xmath0 is assumed to be constant all the time ( although this common assumption is an approximation , and additional effects emerge , e.g. , in growing populations @xcite ) .",
    "each individual is placed on one vertex of a graph containing @xmath0 vertices and can take on one of the three strategies rock , paper , or scissors. as played on schoolyards , rock looses against paper but wins against scissors , and cyclically permutated . in game theory ,",
    "the ` interaction kernel ' quantifying the outcome of agent collisions is cast into a payoff matrix , which reads for rps @xmath1 and we assume that we have a zero - sum rps game .",
    "we now can find the total payoff for a certain individual @xmath2 playing strategy @xmath3 by adding all payoffs that @xmath2 gets from neighbored nodes . with @xmath4 as the adjacency matrix ( whose elements @xmath5 are @xmath6 if two vertices @xmath2 and @xmath7 are connected by a link , and @xmath8 otherwise ) , we can compute the total payoff @xmath9 for an individual @xmath2 by @xmath10 assume the strategy @xmath3 to be @xmath11 .",
    "let us use the notation @xmath12 for the strategy dominated by @xmath11 , and @xmath13 for the strategy that dominates @xmath11 , with @xmath14 as numerical values that represent these strategies . then using the special structure of our payoff matrix",
    ", this term can be simplified to @xmath15 this total payoff can be modified for normalization issues , as we will describe in the next section , because the way of normalization varies in the different update mechanisms , defining rules after which strategy changes occur , depending on @xmath9 .",
    "note that this total payoff can vary relevantly from the case of unstructured populations .",
    "for example , consider the case of a node @xmath2 playing strategy @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath7 be the only vertex @xmath2 is connected to , and let @xmath7 be the only vertex that plays strategy @xmath13 which may dominate @xmath11 so that @xmath2 gets a total payoff @xmath16 although in the whole population there is only one agent that dominates strategy @xmath11 .",
    "this single agent playing strategy @xmath13 would only have negligible influence on the payoff of @xmath2 in a well mixed population , namely , reduce it by @xmath17 .",
    "for the first update rule we have adapted the well known frequency - dependent @xcite moran process @xcite . for normalization , we divide the total payoff @xmath9 by @xmath18 ( being the vertex degree , number of neighbors of @xmath2 ) .",
    "so the payoff reads @xmath19 now we choose a vertex @xmath2 and another vertex @xmath7 , for which @xmath20 holds , at random . with probability",
    "@xmath21 the individual on the vertex @xmath2 reproduces , and its strategy replaces the strategy of the player on the vertex @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath22 is the strength of selection and @xmath23 is the mean fitness of the relevant subpopulation , in our case , all neighbors of @xmath2 .",
    "note that in contrast to the moran process in well mixed populations , @xmath24 needs not to be @xmath8 even for the case of zero - sum rps we have analyzed here ( although this still holds for the expectation value @xmath24 ) .",
    "note also that the original definition of the moran process is slightly different because one should choose an agent @xmath2 for reproduction at random proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "that means we are ensured that there is a real update event in every update step , which is not the case in our definition .",
    "our definition is numerical cheaper because it is not necessary to compute the payoffs for all of the vertices in every time step , and it influences the time scale only by a constant factor .      as the availability of the global information @xmath26 to all individuals may often be unrealistic",
    ", one should also consider processes where only locally available information is of relevance to the dynamics .",
    "in the extreme case , only randomly selected pairs of nodes compete , as in the class of local comparison processes @xcite . from this class",
    ", we have investigated the local update process @xcite as well .",
    "here we , again , normalize the payoff of a vertex @xmath2 by dividing it by the number of its neighbors . then we again choose two linked vertices @xmath2 and @xmath7 .",
    "with probability @xmath27 @xmath7 changes its strategy to the strategy of @xmath2 . here , @xmath28 is the greatest possible payoff difference , that is the difference between the largest and the smallest entry in the payoff matrix .      as a third update rule",
    "we have modified a process introduced by szolnoki , perc , and danku @xcite which one could think of as a simplified version of the local update process at the first view .",
    "we choose a vertex @xmath2 per random and another vertex @xmath7 which is connected to @xmath2 by a link also per random .",
    "in contrast to the moran and the local update process , both payoffs are modified according to the rule @xmath29 ( in the case @xmath30 we again have the payoffs like in the other two processes . ) now , only if @xmath31 , @xmath7 reproduces with probability @xmath32 proportional to the difference of the payoffs , and the strategy of vertex @xmath7 replaces the strategy of vertex @xmath2 .",
    "the maximum in this term has to be understood as the the maximum of the possible payoff difference that two vertices with degrees @xmath18 and @xmath33 can have .",
    "this ensures the probability to always be in the range of @xmath8 and @xmath6 .",
    "one can easily compute this maximum , so we can achieve the following : @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the maximum of @xmath18 and @xmath33 .",
    "all networks used as an underlying topology for such a game should fulfill some common properties . they should be connected , so that we do not have some parts of the population not being linked to the rest of the population . here , we always consider undirected and unweighted ( binary ) graphs . to avoid self - interactions of the agents , self - loops",
    "should be excluded . a schematic illustration of the network types used in this paper is shown in fig .  [ graphendarstellung ] .",
    "the first step of complexity of placing vertices spatially  beyond the linear chain  is a regular square ( or rectangular ) lattice .",
    "typically , each node is connected with @xmath36 or @xmath37 nearest neighbors . to eliminate boundary effects",
    ", we use periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this is a very simple , but in many cases not realistic model , so we have analyzed some other specific types of models that will be presented in the following subsections . for a better comparability with the regular square lattice with natural connectivity of @xmath36 or @xmath37 ,",
    "we have restricted ourselves to graphs with an average vertex degree of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the most frequently used model of real , not lattice - like graphs in the past decades was the erds - renyi ( er ) random graph @xcite .",
    "here one starts with a graph with @xmath0 nodes and connects each pair of nodes with probability @xmath38 . in this model",
    "the probability of finding a node with degree @xmath39 follows a poisson distribution @xmath40 where @xmath41 the graphs we have investigated are constrained in two ways .",
    "on the one hand , they must be connected , what means that there is at least one possibly path from each node to any other so that we do nt have two or more groups of not interrelated agents . on the other hand , we restrict ourselves to networks with a mean vertex degree of @xmath36 or @xmath37 for better comparability with the regular lattice . because we will need only connected graphs with a certain mean degree @xmath42 , and because we would find these networks only with some probability even by adjusting @xmath38 with respect to the number of nodes , we have used the following algorithm : +    1 .",
    "start with a graph * g * with @xmath0 vertices and no edges . 2 .",
    "link randomly chosen vertex pairs if they are not already linked until the total number of edges equals @xmath43 .",
    "now the mean vertex degree will equal @xmath42 .",
    "3 .   if the graph is connected , accept it , otherwise return to step ( 1 ) .",
    "a compromise between the random graph and the regular lattice is the random regular graph with the same degree @xmath42 for all vertices but a much shorter average shortest path length than in a lattice .",
    "for generating the random regular graphs we have used an algorithm proposed by steger and wormald @xcite .",
    "this algorithm ensures to give connected random graphs with equal degree @xmath42 for all vertices : +    1 .",
    "start with a graph * g * with @xmath0 nodes @xmath44 and no edges .",
    "repeat the following until the set * s * is empty : let * s * be the set of vertex pairs @xmath45 of * g * that are not connected by an edge yet with both having at most degree @xmath46 . then choose a specific pair @xmath45 out of * s * with probability proportional to @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the degrees of @xmath50 and @xmath51 in the graph generated up to now",
    "add the edge to * g*. delete the pair @xmath45 from * s*. 3 .   if * g * is @xmath42-regular ( that means connected and of the same degree @xmath42 for all vertices ) , accept it , otherwise return to step ( 1 ) .",
    "the last step with the return statement is necessary because unfortunately the algorithm does not exclude the possibility of receiving disaggregated graphs ( which occurs rarely ) or that the last connection possibilities are only self - loops .",
    "many real networks , primarily huge ones , are described by the er - model in an insufficient way . in many of these networks , for instance the internet @xcite ,",
    "the www @xcite , the network of power nodes in the west of the united states @xcite , the network of scientific collaborations @xcite , or the metabolic network of yeast @xcite one observes a degree distribution that ( approximately ) follows a power law , @xmath52 barabsi and albert @xcite have proposed the following algorithm of modelling complex real networks :    1 .",
    "start with a small number @xmath53 vertices that are all connected to each other .",
    "2 .   add another node and link it to an already present vertex with probability proportional to the degree of this vertex .",
    "add further links in the same fashion until the new vertex has a degree @xmath54 .",
    "3 .   repeat step ( 2 ) ( until you have reached some value of @xmath0 you want ) .",
    "in contrast to the er - model for random graphs or the likewise frequently used watts - strogatz - modell ( @xcite , see next subsection ) this model incorporates two main aspects of real networks , growth and preferential attachment .",
    "namely , most real networks do not have a fixed size but grow like the www @xcite .",
    "the www is also an example for the preferential attachment : when creating a new website , one will typically try to link it to well known and popular sites to gain more attention for ones own site .",
    "because of that , the barabsi - albert network has a high density of so - called hubs . these are vertices that are connected with many other nodes with relatively small vertex degree .",
    "another frequently used network model is the small - world network .",
    "the existence of long range connections with simultaneous appearance of a high local cluster coefficient is a phenomenon often obtained in real networks @xcite . ) .",
    "the notion integrates some slightly different types of networks .",
    "here we have used the original model of watts and strogatz @xcite . in their model one starts with a circle of nodes .",
    "all of them are connected with @xmath39 nearest neighbors ( @xmath55 in the one direction and @xmath55 in the other ) .",
    "afterwards , one starts with rewiring the links , beginning with an arbitrary vertex @xmath2 on the circle . with a certain probability @xmath38 , @xmath2",
    "is disconnected from its nearest neighbor in clockwise direction and is connected to a randomly chosen vertex @xmath7 that is not already linked to @xmath2 . in this way one goes on in clockwise direction until all links to nearest neighbors have been checked for rewiring .",
    "then one goes on with the second nearest neighbor , and so on , until all links have been checked for rewiring .",
    "for @xmath56 one achieves obviously some kind of regular lattice ( that is structured in a different way that the one we have used ) .",
    "in contrast to that , for @xmath57 one achieves a graph equivalent to the er - random graph .",
    "but for intermediate values of @xmath38 one gets networks with high local cluster coefficients like a regular graph ( or lattice ) , but also a small average shortest path length like a random graph @xcite . for the sake of clarity , we have used @xmath58 in all cases .      as a sixth type of networks ,",
    "we have used a graph with a gaussian degree distribution .",
    "this type is a compromise between the er - random graph and the random regular graph . to generate these networks",
    "we have modified the algorithm used for the random regular graph by making the designated vertex degree @xmath39 dependent of @xmath2 , @xmath59 . for these @xmath18",
    "we have used a gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of @xmath60 , where @xmath42 is the designated average vertex degree . by this choice of the standard deviation",
    "it is ensured that almost all designated degrees @xmath18 are positive .",
    "we have ignored the few occurring non - positive ( negative or @xmath8 ) degrees by choosing a new designated degree in the case of such a choice .      to analyze possible effects of the vertex degree distribution in scalefree graphs after barabsi and albert on the dynamics of our games",
    ", we have investigated the dynamics on uncorrelated scalefree graphs as well .",
    "for the construction of such networks we have used the algorithm described in the preceding subsection ( [ stubs ] ) with a power law degree distribution identical with the distribution of vertex degrees of the barabsi - albert scalefree graph instead of a gaussian distribution . to avoid confusion",
    ", we will refer to this graph short as _",
    "uncorrelated_. if we refer to scalefree graphs ( without mentioning anything about the correlation ) we always consider the barabsi - albert network .",
    "we have carried out extensive simulations to obtain the mean time until one of the three strategies has gone extinct when starting with each of the strategies having the same frequency @xmath61 ( this requires that @xmath0 is an integer multiple of three ) .",
    "after the first strategy has vanished , the game lacks its cyclic dominance , and we return to the two strategy case which is well known and will end up in a much shorter time in a single - strategy steady - state because one of the two remaining strategies definitely dominates the second .",
    "note that we measure time in units of single update steps instead of monte carlo steps , where on average each agent has been updated in one time step , so there is a factor of @xmath0 between these two time scales .",
    "first , let us consider the case of well mixed populations for comparison , which is identical to the case of fully connected graphs ( that means each vertex is directly linked to any of the @xmath62 others ) .",
    "we have to distinguish between two cases : the moran and the local update process on the one hand , and the spd - process on the other hand .      in well - mixed populations , the moran and local update process",
    "have been shown in @xcite to have the adjusted replicator equation @xcite and the standard replicator equation @xcite as limits as @xmath0 goes to infinity .",
    "they both have a neutrally stable ( for the zero - sum rps ) fixed point in the state space of strategy densities at @xmath63 . for any other point inside of the simplex , both replicator equations predict neutrally stable oscillations around this fixed point , but in the case of finite populations the population can run out of the fixed point and the orbits around it because of stochastical fluctuations , and end up on the edge of the simplex @xmath64 which is the boundary of the state space . a point on the edge of",
    "this simplex corresponds to the extinction of at least one of the three strategies ( there are three points on the boundary corresponding to the survival of only one strategy ) .",
    "so we expect the met of this system to tend to infinity as @xmath65 .",
    "but at this point there are still two open questions : what is the exact scaling dependence of the met on @xmath0 ? and",
    "how does the selection strength @xmath22 influence this dependence ?    our simulations give clear and short answers for both questions : in the zero - sum rps game , the met is proportional to @xmath66 ( in single birth - death update steps , corresponding to @xmath0 monte carlo steps ) , and independent of @xmath22 ( both is different in the non zero - sum rps case ) . for both processes ,",
    "moran and local update process as well , we have found the mean extinction time @xmath67 to scale as @xcite @xmath68      as this process has never been defined for unstructured populations let us use the complete graph as a model for the mixed population for simplicity , so that we do not have the risk of making any alterations to this update rule if re - defining it .",
    "now we find that , when starting with @xmath63 , each node has as many neighbors of the dominating strategy as of the dominated one , namely @xmath61 . because of the structure of the payoff matrix the fitness is identical to zero for every strategy and node .",
    "so the condition that the second chosen vertex has a greater fitness than the first is never fulfilled , and one will never observe a change in the strategy densities .",
    "for this reason the met becomes infinite even in finite populations ( at least when starting in the point @xmath63 ; even when starting in some neighboured point in the state space we would only achieve some conditional mean extinction time ) .       +   +   +    from the results of our simulations ( see fig .  [ moran_netzwerke ] ) , there are two immediate main observations : first , for some networks biodiversity is greatly stabilized as the met increases exponentially with @xmath0 , while for other networks biodiversity is only slightly stabilized or even destabilized .",
    "second , the met is no longer independent of the selection strength @xmath22 even in the zero - sum rps case that we have considered here .",
    "stabilizing effects of the underlying structure are more distinct for greater @xmath22 .",
    "great stabilization of the biodiversity is only observed for networks with a heterogenous degree distribution and strong selection , while for networks with homogenous degree distribution we have no such strong stabilization .",
    "in fact , the networks with homogenous degree distribution can even lead to a slight destabilization of biodiversity for strong selection , as the met grows slower than @xmath66 , as we can see for the random regular graph . even in the cases of the small world and the gaussian network , which both have a small heterogeneity in their degree distribution",
    ", we have such a destabilization . only for the square lattice we have a stabilization ( although the lattice has a homogenous degree distribution , of course ) , but",
    "the stabilization is much weaker than in case of the random graph or the two scalefree networks . for the stabilization on the lattice , the large average shortest path length might play a role ( which is proportional to @xmath69 instead of @xmath70 as for random networks @xcite ) .    for small @xmath22 ,",
    "there is not a great change in the behaviour of the met on all networks compared to unstructured populations ( fig .",
    "[ moran_netzwerke ] ) .    also , the correlation strength of the network degrees has only minor effect of the stabilization of biodiversity .",
    "the met for an uncorrelated scalefree graph is , in all cases considered here , somewhat smaller than for the barabsi - albert scalefree graph , but in comparison to the other effects , mainly the enormous stabilization impact of scalefree networks , this is negligible .",
    "+   +   +    one of our main points of interest was whether the evolutionary process itself influences the met in the case of a networked population .",
    "the corresponding results for the local update are shown in fig .",
    "[ local_netzwerke ] .",
    "there is no qualitative difference between the results in the moran process and in the local update process .",
    "same as for the moran process , heterogenous degree distributions cause an enormous stabilization of the biodiversity for strong selection ( the met grows exponentially with @xmath0 ) , while homogenous degree distributions do not .",
    "the met is now dependent on the selection strength as well , and for small @xmath22 it is proportional to @xmath66 as in the neutral case .",
    "the only difference is that stabilizing effects are not as strong as in the moran process for the same or even a bit larger @xmath22 .",
    "+   +   +    the spd - process behaves completely different , as shown in fig .",
    "[ szolnoki_netzwerke ] .",
    "we recall that for this update rule the quite general observation that spatial discretization can lead to a stabilization of biodiversity does not hold . even ignoring this and taking a met scaling for large @xmath0 like the @xmath66 scaling from moran process and local update as reference , for",
    "all studied graphs except the lattice we have a destabilization , and the met grows slower than @xmath66 with only small differences between the different networks . only in the lattice case",
    "the met grows exponentially with @xmath0 .",
    "changing the parameter @xmath71 has minor influence on the properties of the met than the selection strength @xmath22 in the moran and the local update process . for degree homogenous networks ,",
    "the met is even independent of @xmath71 . for networks with a strong heterogeneity in the degree distribution",
    "the met grows with @xmath71 for the same value of @xmath0 .",
    "there is also some influence of the correlation of network degrees . for the uncorrelated scalefree network ,",
    "the influence of the parameter @xmath71 on the met is not as great as for the barabsi - albert network , and the mets for the same @xmath0 , but different @xmath71 and @xmath72 are closer together . but compared to the other effects , this is again negligible .",
    "for a version of the rps game with constant reaction rates it has already been shown that networks with heterogenous degree distribution effect a stabilization of biodiversity @xcite .",
    "this corresponds with our simulation results so we have adapted the approach from @xcite to underpin the shown behaviour theoretically .",
    "first let us define the probability density of the strategy @xmath11 on all nodes with degree @xmath39 as @xmath73 .",
    "here we again use the notation @xmath11 for an arbitrary strategy , @xmath12 for the strategy dominated by @xmath11 , and @xmath13 for the dominating strategy .",
    "then the probability @xmath74 that a neighbored node of an arbitrary vertex plays strategy @xmath75 reads @xmath76 here @xmath77 is the probability of finding a vertex with degree @xmath39 .",
    "dividing by the average vertex degree , @xmath78 , assures the standardization .",
    "further , by the conservation of the total density one of the quantities @xmath79 and of @xmath80 is given so that we can eliminate @xmath81 and @xmath82 using @xmath83 and @xmath84 as variables , or @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively @xmath87 the average payoff of a player of strategy @xmath11 on a node with degree @xmath39 is then given by @xmath88 we find that the average payoff is independent of the vertex degree @xmath39 so we can drop the index @xmath39 , @xmath89 . with this",
    "we can compute the average payoff of neighbours of a vertex @xmath90 by using @xmath91 instead of @xmath92 we consider that is more likely to have a vertex with a high degree as a neighbour than one with a smaller degree if both are equally frequent .",
    "thus we find the probability for a player with strategy @xmath11 sitting on a node with degree @xmath39 to reproduce as @xmath93 and the rate with that a player of strategy @xmath11 sitting on a vertex with degree @xmath39 conveys his strategy to a node with degree @xmath94 , which has played strategy @xmath75 before , reads @xmath95 for @xmath96 ( @xmath97 is the kronecker symbol ) this reduces to @xmath98 here we have omitted any @xmath39-indices because there is only one degree left .",
    "the payoffs reduce to @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and one obeys the hopping rates for the moran process in well mixed populations @xcite independent of @xmath53 .",
    "this rate describes how likely it is that a player with strategy @xmath75 is replaced by a copy of another player with strategy @xmath11 in a single time step .",
    "let us now consider a heterogenous degree distribution . in the simplest case ,",
    "such a distribution consists of only two degrees @xmath101 and @xmath102 with frequencies @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "the replicator equation that we obtain from the master equation in the limit @xmath105 for the changing of the frequency of the strategy @xmath8 on nodes with degree @xmath101 reads ( for the methodology see e.g.@xcite ) : @xmath106 inserting our special degree distribution , after a longish but straightforward calculation we find @xmath107 here @xmath108 is the background fitness .",
    "@xmath109 is the mean fitness of all players on vertices with degree @xmath101 , and @xmath110 correspondingly for @xmath102 .",
    "then one can compute the other equations in an analogical way or by cyclically permuting the indices . for each vertex degree ,",
    "one of the equations of motion needs not to be taken into account by the constraint @xmath111 . for @xmath112 or alternatively @xmath113",
    "this flattens to the well known adjusted replicator equation in the case of well mixed populations , as expected @xcite .",
    "likewise , the fixed point of this replicator equation at @xmath114 does not alter , we now just have two densities for every strategy .",
    "but now the velocity of the reaction is directly dependent of @xmath22 because it is no longer possible to absorbe the strength of selection by a dynamical rescaling of time , as it is possible for well mixed populations .",
    "but what about the stability of this inner fixed point ? within a linear stability analysis ,",
    "let us linearize the replicator equation around its fixed point @xmath115 with @xmath116 and @xmath117 being the jacobian of the system with @xmath118 . in our case , we find @xmath117 as @xmath119 to reason about the stability we need to know the signs of the real parts of the eigenvalues @xmath120 of this matrix , but for these eigenvalues we derive quite complicated terms , the signs of which can not be easily designated ( but see appendix [ eigenwerte_moran ] ) .",
    "the routh - hurwitz criterion as an alternative solution does not simplyify the situation considerably .",
    "approximating an upper bound of the real parts of all eigenvalues , it is possible to compute a region in the parameter space where the inner fixed point is guaranteed to be asymptotically stable , namely , for @xmath121 for a given value of @xmath38 this determines the ratio of @xmath35 and @xmath122 , or , the other way round , if we want to build up a network with chosen values for @xmath35 and @xmath122 , this inequality tells us what frequencies of both vertex degrees are necessary to stabilize biodiversity .",
    "so , for example , if we choose @xmath123 and both vertex degrees should be equally frequent , @xmath102 must be at least @xmath124 to fulfill this inequality . if a higher frequency of @xmath101 is desired , @xmath102 must even be larger .",
    "but as this is just a rough approximation , by inserting numerical values we have found that almost all eigenvalues are @xmath125 , except for the trivial cases @xmath112 , @xmath126 or @xmath113 .",
    "so for all values except these mentioned cases , we have found the fixed point to be asymptotically stable . here",
    ", we have found numerically that the real parts of the eigenvalues become more negative as the difference of @xmath101 and @xmath102 grows in absolute size , and both vertex degrees become equally likely to be found in the network .",
    "this explains as well why the stabilization of biodiversity is greater in the case of the scalefree graphs than for the er - random graph , or it is in both cases greater than for the network with a gaussian degree distribution , which has only as small heterogeneity in its degree distribution .      as we have seen in the previous section , for small @xmath22",
    "the met is almost proportional to @xmath66 as in the well mixed case , and depends only marginally on the underlying network structure .",
    "we can intuitively understand this as follows : if @xmath22 is small , than every transition probability is @xmath127 , and the corresponding replicator equation in our system reads @xmath128 for all values of @xmath11 and @xmath39 .",
    "hence , each point of the state space is a neutrally stable fixed point in the limit @xmath65 .",
    "therefore there should be no stabilization impact compared to the well mixed case , as there each point in the simplex belongs to a neutrally stable limit cycle , so in both cases a perturbation is neither expected to decay nor to grow in time .",
    "following the same scheme as for the moran process , one can derive similar results ( see appendix [ local_theo ] for details ) .",
    "as in the moran process , a degree heterogeneity leads to a stabilization of biodiversity , but again the eigenvalues of the jacobian are too byzantine for catching the signs of the real parts easily .      for this update process , we will use a simpler method to achieve a theoretical understanding of some of the numerical results . in the case of both chosen vertices having the same degree ,",
    "the probability for the node @xmath2 to change its strategy to the strategy of @xmath7 simplifies to @xmath129 so for the lattice and the random regular graph , where all vertex degrees are the same , any dependence of @xmath71 drops out . note that in this equation and in this whole subsection , when talking about @xmath9 we consider the not modified payoffs . for @xmath130",
    "one achieves the same term as in the case of degree homogenous networks ( eq .  [ eq29 ] ) , independent of the network , while for @xmath30 we find @xmath131 or @xmath132 respectively , depending on which of the vertex degrees is greater .",
    "if we compare the probabilities for @xmath130 and for @xmath30 by computing the ratio of both , we can analyze the impact of the parameter @xmath71 and the underlying network structure on the met .",
    "we find @xmath133 or @xmath134 respectively .",
    "if we account for the fact that @xmath135 must hold , then the first fraction is @xmath136 for @xmath137 and @xmath138 for @xmath139 .",
    "hence , if aside from @xmath71 all conditions are the same , for @xmath130 it is more likely that a strategy with a lower payoff reproduces , if @xmath140 ) than for @xmath30 . on the other hand under these conditions for @xmath130 it is less likely that a strategy with a high payoff reproduces , than for @xmath30 . in the second case , the fraction is @xmath136 for @xmath137 and @xmath141 and @xmath138 for all other cases .",
    "hence for @xmath130 it is more likely that a strategy with a high payoff replaces a strategy with a smaller payoff from a node with a smaller vertex degree , than for @xmath30 . and for @xmath130 under this conditions it is as much more likely that a strategy with a smaller payoff reproduces . taken together , for @xmath130 strategies with a smaller payoff have a bigger chance to reproduce , and they are less likely to be replaced by a strategy with a higher payoff , than for @xmath30 .",
    "hence on degree - heterogenous networks the met should be greater for @xmath130 than for @xmath30 , as it is confirmed by the simulation results ( fig .",

    "cyclic coevolutionary dynamics manifests an interesting class of dynamical systems that are discussed as models to explain long - term stabilization of coexistence of species or strategies . in this paper",
    "we have shown that , for the coevolutionary rps game on complex networks , there are considerable differences in the mean extinction time ( met ) between different networks , and for different processes as well .",
    "the simple statement `` spatial discretization stabilizes biodiversity '' must be refined in a more sophisticated way .",
    "while for example in the moran and in the local update process degree - heterogenous networks preserve biodiversity ( the met grows exponentially with the number @xmath0 of players ) , in the spd - process they do not , and even degree - homogeneous networks may destabilize while the lattice still stabilizes . in summary , we have shown that , for the cyclic evolutionary rps on networks , there is a striking influence on the mean extinction time characteristics of the spatial structure _ and _ the update rule as well .",
