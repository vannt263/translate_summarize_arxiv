    "after the first experiments @xcite on quantum teleportation using two  mode squeezed states @xcite , as well as those @xcite dealing with entanglement in atomic ensembles @xcite , a significant amount of work has been devoted to develop a quantum information theory of continuous variable systems .",
    "so far , most of the theoretical work has focused on the entanglement properties of the quantum states involved in all these experiments , the so  called _ gaussian states_. some examples of the achievements in this field are the following .",
    "the problem of qualifying entanglement has been solved in the general bipartite setting @xcite and in the three mode case @xcite .",
    "the distillation problem has also been answered in the general case @xcite , as well as in the case in which the class of allowed operations is restricted to those that conserve the gaussian form @xcite .",
    "in contrast to all this theoretical work on ( the static ) entanglement properties of gaussian states , very few results @xcite have been obtained on the dynamics of entanglement on these systems , i.e. , on how to use the interactions provided by the physical set  ups in order to entangle the systems in the most efficient way .",
    "this paper provides a rather complete theory of the dynamics of entanglement in these experimental settings .",
    "the dynamics of entanglement has been recently analyzed in systems of two or more qubits @xcite . in that case one",
    "distinguishes between two scenarios . in the first one @xcite ,",
    "the interaction between the qubits is described by a hamiltonian @xmath3 . the goal is to determine the sequence of local gates for which the increase of entanglement after some small ( infinitesimal ) time is maximal for a given initial state . in the second one @xcite ,",
    "the interaction is given in terms of a non  local gate , which can be applied only once .",
    "apart from its fundamental interest , these studies give some practical ways of creating entanglement in the most efficient way and may become relevant in several experimental situations . another interesting and related problem is the one of hamiltonian and gate simulation @xcite . here , one assumes that the two qubits interact via some given hamiltonian @xmath3 and the goal is to determine a sequence of local instantaneous gates in order to obtain in minimal time either a complete time - evolution generated by some other hamiltonian [ hamiltonian simulation ] or some desired unitary gate ( gate engineering ) .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze all these problems for two  mode pure gaussian states and interaction hamiltonians which preserve the gaussian character .",
    "we also study the generation of squeezing , since although it has no counterpart in the qubit case , it is a valuable resource in present experiments @xcite .",
    "given the fact that we touch on several different topics and therefore develop different mathematical tools , we have decided to write a section which explains in detail the different problems we consider and the corresponding results . in the following sections we give detailed derivations of these results .",
    "we stress the fact that the problems studied here are all motivated by the experimental situation in which light gets entangled with an atomic ensemble via a kerr  like interaction @xcite .",
    "we expect that the techniques developed in this paper can be easily extended to address other related problems , like the one of entangling two atomic ensembles using light .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the section sec .",
    "[ secover ] should be considered as a survey of the results presented in the paper . in section sec .",
    "[ secsim ] we show which hamiltonians can be simulated using a given interaction and how to do so optimally .",
    "we also show that , in fact , any general gaussian operation can be generated in the considered set  up . in section sec .",
    "[ secrate ] we determine the optimal rate of entanglement generation as well as of squeezing generation for arbitrary input states . finally , in section sec .  [ secfintim ]",
    "we give an optimal entanglement generation scheme for finite times , starting out from a product ( unsqueezed ) state .",
    "this section gives an overview of the content of this paper and it is composed of three subsections . in the first one , we explain the physical set - up that we are going to analyze . in the second one",
    "we collect the main definitions used thereafter . in the third section",
    "we give the main results of the paper without proving them . for the detailed derivations we refer the reader to the following sections .",
    "we consider a continuous variable system composed of two one  mode systems coupled via some interaction hamiltonian .",
    "the goal is to analyze which kind of evolutions we can achieve with such an interaction if certain instantaneous local operations can be applied at will . in particular",
    ", we study optimal methods of creating or increasing the entanglement shared by the two modes .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian has the general form @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are real parameters , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are canonical operators for the first and second mode , respectively .",
    "we use dimensionless units throughout the paper .",
    "we assume that local operations , generated by the hamiltonians @xmath9 can be applied instantaneously , where @xmath10 is a real number that can be tuned at will .",
    "these operations can neither change the entanglement nor the squeezing present in the state .",
    "lastly , we assume that the initial state is pure and gaussian .",
    "our choice of the hamiltonian interaction as well as the instantaneous local operations is motivated by current experiments with atomic ensembles @xcite .",
    "in particular , to those set - ups in which an atomic ensemble interacts with two modes of the electromagnetic field   with different polarizations @xcite .",
    "if the atoms are sufficiently polarized along some given direction ( say @xmath11 ) we can replace the total angular momentum operators describing the internal state of the atoms by canonical operators .",
    "that is ( if the involved levels have spin @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , with @xmath16\\simeq i$ ] ( @xmath17 ) , and where @xmath18 is the number of atoms .",
    "this approximation is valid as long as @xmath19 for all times @xcite .",
    "similarly , if the electromagnetic field is sufficiently polarized along some direction , we can substitute the stokes operators by canonical ones , @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite .    for some atomic structures and off - resonant interactions ,",
    "the hamiltonian describing the interaction between the atomic ensemble and the light can be written as @xcite @xmath22 which is a particular case of eq .",
    "( [ generalhint ] ) ; in the following we will put the coupling constant @xmath23 when referring to @xmath24 . in the same scenario , simple and fast local operations can be performed on the atoms and the electromagnetic field .",
    "for example , a magnetic field or a polarizer gives rise to the local hamiltonians eq .",
    "( [ hloc ] ) .",
    "since the interaction between atoms and light is typically weak , with moderate magnetic fields the operations generated locally can be regarded as instantaneous . on the other hand , if the atoms and the light are completely polarized , the corresponding state in terms of our continuous variable description is the tensor product of two vacuum states , in particular it is a pure gaussian state .",
    "we emphasize that even though we have motivated our choices with some particular physical set - up , our description is applicable to other physical situations and our results apply to the general interaction hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ generalhint ] ) . in that case",
    ", we make no more references to the physical nature of our systems .",
    "however , in some cases we particularize our results to the considered physical situation described above .",
    "now we consider the following general _ strategy _ for state or gate engineering which can be realized using the tools described above . starting with a pure initial state , described by the density operator @xmath25 , we perform fast local operations @xmath26 on the state and we then let @xmath3 act on it for a time @xmath27",
    ". then we perform again local rotations , @xmath28 followed by the non  local interaction generated by @xmath3 for a time @xmath29 and so on until @xmath30 .",
    "this yields to the total time - evolution operator @xmath31u(t_n)\\cdots u(t_2)[v_{1}\\otimes w_{1}]u(t_1)[v_{0}\\otimes w_{0 } ] , \\label{simprot0}\\ ] ] so that @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath33 .",
    "first , we want to analyze which @xmath34 are achievable with this strategy .",
    "second , for a given @xmath25 we look for the best choice of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and the local operations @xmath37 in order to maximize the created entanglement / squeezing .",
    "we consider two different regimes .",
    "first , we choose @xmath38 ( the characteristic time of the interaction ) so that we can expand all the @xmath39 as well as @xmath40 in lowest order in @xmath41 .",
    "second , we choose @xmath41 finite . in the following we refer to those two regimes as infinitesimal and finite respectively",
    ".      since all the hamiltonians we are considering are at most quadratic in @xmath42 and @xmath43 , an initial gaussian state will be gaussian at all times .",
    "this means that we can fully describe it by the first and second moments of @xmath44 , with @xmath45 , i.e. the expectation values @xmath46 , also called displacements of @xmath47 and the variances @xmath48 $ ] . the latter are collected in the _ correlation matrix _ ( cm ) of the state @xmath47 , the real , symmetric , positive matrix @xmath49 defined by @xmath50\\}.\\ ] ] in our description , the displacements are of no importance : they have no influence on the entanglement and squeezing properties of the states and can be brought to zero by local displacement operations , which can be easily implemented in our physical set - up .",
    "therefore we take @xmath51 in this paper .",
    "we often write the correlation matrix in the block form @xmath52 with @xmath53 matrices @xmath54 , where @xmath55 refers to the first system and @xmath56 to second system .",
    "the matrix @xmath57 describes the correlations between both systems and vanishes for product states .",
    "all the states and operations we consider here are pure .",
    "therefore , and since we look at two - mode states only , we can always write their cm in the form @xcite @xmath58 which we refer to as the _ pure state standard form _ of @xmath49 . here",
    ", @xmath59 are local symplectic matrices , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the pauli matrix @xmath62 .",
    "the parameter @xmath63 contains all information about the entanglement of the state , whereas @xmath64 and @xmath65 contain information about local squeezing .",
    "given a cm @xmath49 , one can readily find its pure state standard form , where @xmath66 are rotations and @xmath67 .",
    "the six matrices are determined as follows : @xmath68 diagonalize @xmath69 .",
    "then the two eigenvalues @xmath70 of @xmath55 determine @xmath71 as @xmath72 ( similarly for @xmath73 ) and the @xmath74 are the rotations that realize the singular value decomposition of @xmath75 .",
    "the two - mode squeezing parameter @xmath63 is given by @xmath76 , while the squeezing parameters @xmath77 of @xmath78 can then be calculated by the trace of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , resp .",

    "we state here the main results of this paper .",
    "to give a clear picture of them we do not use more mathematically tools and definitions than necessary .",
    "first we characterize the interactions which we are able to generate within the setting described by eq .",
    "( [ simprot0 ] ) . in the infinitesimal regime",
    "the problem is usually called hamiltonian simulation , whereas for @xmath90 finite it is usually called gate simulation",
    ". then we use these results to find the optimal strategy to generate entanglement / squeezing both in the infinitesimal and finite regime .      given two hamiltonians @xmath3 and @xmath91 of the form ( [ generalhint ] )",
    "we want to see the conditions under which @xmath3 can simulate @xmath91 .",
    "that is , for a given sufficiently small @xmath92 we want to find out if it is possible to have @xmath93e^{-iht_{n}}\\cdots e^{-iht_{2}}[v_{1}\\otimes w_{1}]e^{-iht_{1}}[v_{0}\\otimes w_{0}].\\ ] ] with @xmath41 small as well .",

    "thus except for the cases @xmath103 every hamiltonian of the form ( [ generalhint ] ) can simulate all other hamiltonians of that form ( including the @xmath104 case ) .",
    "in particular , with the hamiltonian @xmath24 describing the atom - light interaction one can simulate every bilinear hamiltonian ( [ generalhint ] ) and can do so efficiently as long as @xmath105 . in this case , the interaction existing in the physical setup can be considered universal .",
    "we show that starting from the hamiltonians @xmath3 and @xmath106 of eqs .",
    "( [ generalhint],[hloc ] ) it is possible to generate any desired unitary evolution of the form @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is an arbitrary self  adjoint operator quadratic in @xmath109 , if and only if @xmath110 generate a set of universal linear gates for continuous variables smaller than the one given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us analyze some important applications of these results in the case of atomic ensembles interacting with light .",
    "they imply that with current experiments with atomic ensembles one can generate all unitary linear operations , as well as arbitrary gaussian states .",
    "in particular , one can generate local squeezing operators for which @xmath111 [ which are not included among the hamiltonians of the form ( [ generalhint ] ) and therefore can not be simulated infinitesimally by any of them ] and therefore one can generate squeezing in the atomic system , light system or both independently ( without performing measurements ) .",
    "on the other hand , one can use @xmath24 to generate the swap operator , which ( in the heisenberg picture ) transforms @xmath112 this operation can be generated in a finite time .",
    "thus , one can use the interaction @xmath24 to realize a perfect interface between light and atoms , which allows to use the atomic ensemble as a quantum memory for light , as opposed to the case in ref .",
    "@xcite where this result is obtained in the limit of very strong interaction .",
    "the problem that we consider now can be stated as follows .",
    "let us assume that we have some initial pure gaussian state and we have some interaction described by the general hamiltonian ( [ generalhint ] ) at our disposal for a short time @xmath113 .",
    "the initial state at time @xmath90 is described by some correlation matrix of the form @xmath114 and possesses an entanglement @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is some measure of entanglement .",
    "we would like to increase the entanglement as much as possible .    since for the case of two modes in a pure state there is a single parameter that describes the entanglement [ cf .",
    "( [ sstandard ] ) ] , all entanglement measures are monotonically dependent on each other .",
    "one particular measure is the parameter @xmath63 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ gamma2 ] ) , @xmath117 .",
    "in fact , @xmath118 is the log - negativity @xcite of the gaussian state .",

    "we use the obvious notation @xmath121 $ ] when considering the time - evolution of @xmath119 .",

    "this local operation achieves the maximum @xmath138 for the rhs in eq .",
    "( [ locsqparam ] ) as given by von neumann s trace theorem @xcite . ] .",
    "thus we see that the entanglement rate depends on the initial local squeezing of the two modes as well as the angle between the two locally squeezed quadratures , but it does not depend on the entanglement of the state . rewriting @xmath139 as @xmath140 we see that some hamiltonians can produce entanglement even if there is no local squeezing present in the state ( which implies that @xmath141 ) , while others ( notably the beam splitter with @xmath142 ) can not .",
    "note that the rate goes to infinity as local squeezing is increased , in contrast to the case of qubits . given a cm @xmath49 ,",
    "there are typically local rotations that enhance the entanglement rate .    from these results",
    "we conclude that if the goal is to create as much entanglement as possible it is more efficient to squeeze the state locally first ( if possible ) before using the interaction ; in particular , the use of squeezed light @xcite is advantageous compared to coherent light @xcite .",
    "now we consider the problem of optimal squeezing generation in the same set - up as in the previous subsection .",
    "we take as a measure of squeezing of a correlation matrix @xmath49 , @xmath143 , any monotonically increasing function of @xmath144 , where @xmath144 is minus the logarithm of the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath49 .",

    "here @xmath150 , with @xmath151 is the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the minimal eigenvalue of @xmath114 .",
    "now we consider the situation in which we start with both modes in the vacuum state and we have a hamiltonian @xmath3 for a finite time ( as well as instantaneous local operations ) .",
    "we show that the optimal way to create entanglement is to apply local instantaneous operations flipping the @xmath42 and @xmath43 variables of both systems periodically after small times @xmath152 . after a finite time @xmath90 ( and for @xmath153 ) this produces ( up to local rotations ) a two - mode squeezed state , which is both optimally squeezed and entangled .",
    "in particular , @xmath154 and @xmath155 .    we also show that it is not possible to increase the entanglement using gaussian measurements during the evolution .",
    "we consider a system with cm @xmath49 and ancilla systems in vacuum state .",
    "we allow for linear passive interactions ( described by a symplectic and orthogonal matrix @xmath156 ) between one system and the ancillas and show that a gaussian measurement does neither increase the squeezing nor the entanglement .",
    "this result implies that our method is optimal even if we allow for feedback , something which has been recently considered in the context of spin squeezing generation @xcite .    for the case of atomic ensembles",
    "our result implies that there is a method to improve the entanglement generation in present experiments @xcite .",
    "in this section we characterize all the unitary evolutions which we can generate within the given setup .",
    "that is we define the set of unitary operators which can be written as ( [ simprot0 ] ) .",
    "the first part of this section is devoted to the infinitesimal regime , where we will in general derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for hamiltonian simulation .",

    "[ fcounter ] shows : we start with a slightly entangled state with cm @xmath431 which can be obtained from the two - mode squeezed state @xmath432 squeezing both @xmath433 and @xmath20 by @xmath434 .",

    "the difference to the qubit case is related to the fact that in the cv context not all local transformations are available and hence not all equally entangled states are locally equivalent .",
    "we have investigated how a quadratic interaction between two continuous variable systems ( as it occurs naturally in certain quantum optical systems ) can be optimally used to perform several quantum information tasks when certain simple local control operations ( phase space rotations ) can be implemented as well .",

    "in particular , we have shown that the naturally occurring hamiltonian eq .  ( [ hint ] ) allows to simulate all bilinear hamiltonians and is in fact of the most versatile kind for this purpose .",

    "we have addressed the questions of optimal creation of entanglement and squeezing for a two  mode gaussian state using a given interaction of the form ( [ generalhint ] ) and local rotations of the form @xmath443 , both of which are available in current experiments . for the case of small ( infinitesimal ) interaction times , we have determined the optimal strategy to increase entanglement or squeezing for any input state , i.e , we have derived the maximal entanglement and squeezing rates and determined the strategies which lead to these maxima . for the general case ( finite interaction time ) we have derived the optimal strategy for the creation of entanglement and squeezing starting with the vacuum state .",
    "we have also shown that ( in contrast to qubit systems ) for continuous variables optimizing the entanglement rate is not necessarily the best way to generate a finite amount of entanglement .",

    "another interesting application for atomic ensembles is enabled by the so - called spin - squeezed states @xcite which have been prepared experimentally in settings similar to the one described in this paper @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that these states allow for a significant increase in the precision of atomic clocks @xcite .",
    "while the methods presented above show efficient ways to create squeezed atomic states ( e.g. , by using the interaction to create squeezing or entanglement optimally and then project the atoms into a pure squeezed state by measuring the light ) , it would also be interesting to find the _ optimal _ such procedure .",
    "note that the argument in sec .",
    "[ secfintim ] is easily adapted to similar circumstances .",
    "e.g. , it was shown in @xcite that the interaction between the atoms of a suitably prepared bose - einstein  condensate ( bec ) can be described by the quadratic hamiltonian @xmath448 , which can be used to drive the bec into a spin squeezed state . by the same reasoning as in sec .",
    "[ secfintim ] we see that after an interaction time @xmath90 a squeezing of @xmath449 is the maximum achievable .",
    "this shows optimality of the procedure suggested in @xcite ( which employs effectively the so - called `` two - axes counter - twisting '' hamiltonian ) .    in summary",
    ", we have investigated the capabilities of cv interaction hamiltonians @xmath3 .",
    "we have shown which other hamiltonians can be simulated with such an @xmath3 and the available control operations and how to do so efficiently .",
    "then we have derived the optimal entanglement generation rates achievable with this hamiltonian and given an optimal protocol for the generation of entanglement between the two modes for finite times .",
