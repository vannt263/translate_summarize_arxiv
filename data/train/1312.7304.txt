    "gamma rays and neutrinos can be generated in cosmic ray sources due to the interaction of the cosmic rays with ambient photons and/or protons .",
    "powerful cosmic ray accelerators can be located in the galactic center region ; therefore , the observation of gamma rays and neutrinos coming from the galactic center is of great importance for the identification and understanding of the galactic cosmic ray sources .",
    "it is worth noting that , in contrast with charged cosmic rays , these two types of secondary particles are not deviated by the magnetic fields present in the interstellar medium and then they point back to its source .",
    "the icecube collaboration has recently reported the observation of 28 neutrino events in the energy range from 30 tev to 1.2 pev @xcite , while only @xmath0 events were expected considering a conventional atmospheric neutrino background .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath1 excess . despite the large angular uncertainty of these events ( @xmath2 )",
    ", we can observe that 5 of the 28 events come from the galactic center region .",
    "however , there is a degeneracy about the origin of these neutrinos because they can also originate outside our galaxy .",
    "it has been pointed out that the gamma ray flux associated with the neutrino flux can be useful to constrain or even identify the candidate neutrino sources @xcite . in particular , in refs .  @xcite it is found that the the gamma ray data taken by fermi lat at lower energies are consistent with a galactic origin of these five events . however , the upper limits on the diffuse gamma ray flux obtained by different experiments at higher energies disfavor this hypothesis @xcite .    on the other hand , the region in the cosmic ray energy spectrum where the transition from the galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays takes place is still unknown ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "two possible regions for this transition are the second knee , a steepening of the spectrum which is given at an energy of @xmath3 eev , and the ankle , a hardening of the spectrum placed at an energy of @xmath4 eev . in ref .  @xcite it has been pointed out that the identification of galactic neutrino sources and the observation of their spectra can contribute to finding the region where the transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays takes place .",
    "this is due to the fact that the end of the neutrino energy spectrum is correlated with the maximum energy at which the cosmic rays are accelerated in the source .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the observation of the end of the neutrino spectrum , of a given galactic source , at @xmath5 pev favors the scenario in which the transition takes place in the second knee region , whereas the observation of @xmath6 pev favors the scenario in which the transition is given at the ankle region .",
    "the most probable mechanism for the production of gamma rays and neutrinos in galactic cosmic ray sources is the interaction of cosmic rays with ambient protons @xcite . in this work",
    "we study in detail the shape of the gamma ray and neutrino spectra that originate from the proton - proton interaction in galactic cosmic ray sources placed in the galactic center region , which is motivated by the recent icecube results .",
    "we consider different shapes of the proton spectrum based on acceleration models .",
    "we also consider the values for the maximum energy of protons corresponding to the galactic to extragalactic transition in the second knee region and in the ankle region .",
    "the propagation of the gamma rays and neutrinos from the galactic center to the solar system is included in these calculations .",
    "while neutrinos suffer flavor oscillation during propagation , gamma rays can interact with the photons of the galactic interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) which is the most important one @xcite .",
    "in particular , we find that the ratio between the neutrino and gamma ray spectra depends on the cosmic ray proton spectrum , which can be used to study the conditions under which the cosmic ray protons are accelerated in the source .",
    "finally , we study the possibility to discriminate between the galactic and extragalactic origins of a neutrino spectrum observed in the direction of the galactic center by observing the associated gamma ray flux , which in principle will be possible with the planned high energy gamma ray observatories .",
    "gamma rays and neutrinos can be produced as a result of the interaction of the cosmic rays with ambient protons present in the sources .",
    "gamma rays are mainly produced by the decay of neutral pions ; @xmath7 mesons also contribute to the gamma ray flux .",
    "the generation of neutrinos is dominated by the decay of charged pions .",
    "positive ( negative ) charged pions mainly decay into an antimuon and a muon ( antimuon ) neutrino , @xmath8 the subsequent decay of the muons and antimuons produces more neutrinos , @xmath9 it is believed that the galactic cosmic rays are accelerated principally at supernova remnants ( see e.  g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) by means of the first order fermi mechanism .",
    "also , the experimental evidence indicates that the injected composition of the galactic sources is dominated by protons @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of protons that escape from the acceleration region accelerated via the first order fermi mechanism , without taking account of energy losses , can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a normalization constant , @xmath12 is the spectral index , @xmath13 refers to the maximum energy which indicates the end of the spectrum ( note that protons can be accelerated to higher energies than @xmath13 ) , and @xmath14 comes from the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient in the acceleration region , @xmath15 ( see appendix [ acc ] for details ) .",
    "cosmic rays can suffer energy losses during the acceleration process due to the presence of strong magnetic fields and ambient low energy photons @xcite .",
    "the spectrum near its end can have different shapes , including pileups and sudden cutoffs , depending on the type of energy loss dominating in the acceleration region .",
    "then , in the subsequent analyses a proton spectrum with a sudden cutoff in @xmath13 is also considered , @xmath16 figure [ protons ] shows the proton spectra for @xmath17 and for @xmath18 ( kolmogorov spectrum ) , @xmath19 ( kraichnan spectrum ) , and @xmath20 ( completely disordered field ) @xcite . the spectrum corresponding to the sudden cutoff is also shown .",
    "the maximum energy considered is @xmath21 tev , which corresponds to the transition between the galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays in the region of the second knee .",

    "the electron and muon neutrinos oscillate during propagation ; therefore , the flavor ratio observed at the earth is different from the one in the source .",
