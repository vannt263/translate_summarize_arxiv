    "as we all know , chiral symmetry breaking was originally explained quite well by nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model as early as 1961 @xcite . like in superconductivity ,",
    "the strong attractive force between quark and antiquark in the @xmath2 channel can create non - perturbative ground state with @xmath3 condensation . due to the pair condensation , the original symmetry between massless left and right - handed quarks is broken down to @xmath4 , and then the quarks obtain constituent mass .",
    "the remaining residual interactions between the constituent quarks bind them into collective excitations , i.e. , hadrons in the chiral symmetry breaking vacuum . especially in the pseudoscalar channel the residual strong interaction creates massless pions as goldstone bosons in the chiral limit . when a small current quark mass @xmath5 is introduced in the theory , chiral symmetry",
    "is explicitly broken , and pion obtains its small physical mass @xmath6 .",
    "although the njl model has two serious drawbacks , i.e. , lacks of confinement and renormalizability , it is still regarded as an applicable model at low momentum , especially for dealing with processes of pion , such as pion - pion scattering near threshold .",
    "traditionally , the scheme of the njl model is represented by two schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equations , one is for the constituent quark propagator , and the other is for the composite meson propagator . at the lowest level ,",
    "the applications of the njl model are based upon mean - field approximation @xcite - @xcite , i.e. , hartree approximation to the gap equation for quark mass and the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) to the bethe - salpeter equation for meson mass .",
    "it is clear , that at this level the solution of the gap equation determines the meson propagators , but the solution of meson sd equation has no feedback to the quark propagator .",
    "since the constituent quark propagator is the fundamental element , from which all the quantities , including quark mass , meson masses and quark - antiquark condensate , are calculated , it is necessary to consider the back contribution of meson modes to the quark propagator .    among efforts @xcite - @xcite to go beyond the mean - field approximation , refs . @xcite and @xcite are in a chirally symmetric self - consistent approximation , namely the chiral properties such as the goldstone s theorem , the goldberger - treiman relation and the conservation of the quark axial current are exactly preserved in the chiral limit of the njl model . by using effective action method in a semi - bosonized way , and expanding the action to one quark - loop and one - meson - loop in @xcite , or directly evaluating the feynman diagrams under the constraint to keep the chiral relations at quark level in @xcite .    in this paper , we extend the method of @xcite to a general scheme with explicit chiral symmetry breaking in the su(2 ) njl model .",
    "different from the case in the chiral limit , we must be careful to deal with the form of internal meson propagators . in a way different from @xcite ,",
    "we regard the constituent quark as the fundamental element and only expand quark s propagator in the power of small external momentum in the calculation of feynman diagrams .    in the process to go beyond the mean - field approximation , we have to deal with the divergent integrals of quark loops and meson loops .",
    "we adopt pauli - villars regulation @xcite to treat divergent integrals resulted from quark loops , and choose a covariant cutoff @xmath7 for the meson momentum .",
    "there are four parameters in our treatment , namely the current quark mass @xmath5 , quark coupling constant @xmath8 , fermionic cut - off @xmath9 and bosonic cut - off @xmath7 , to be fixed . in the mean - field approximation ,",
    "the three parameters @xmath5 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 are usually fixed by comparing with the pion mass @xmath10 mev , pion decay constant @xmath11 mev and the quark condensate @xmath12 mev . in the near future , the dirac experiment will measure the @xmath13 scattering lengths in good precision , which will shed some light on the quark condensate @xcite . to see clearly the quark condensate dependence of the four parameters , we give only the quark condensate a reasonable constraint : -300 mev @xmath14 -200 mev .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section 2 , we briefly review the general scheme represented by two schwinger - dyson equations in the su(2 ) njl model . in section 3 ,",
    "we introduce the method of external momentum expansion , and prove a general relation between the pion polarization function and the axial - vector matrix element .",
    "we also deduce the internal meson propagator to @xmath1 order in the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "our numerical results with mesonic contributions and the effect of explicit chiral symmetry breaking will be shown in section 4 .",
    "the conclusions are given at the end .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the traditional scheme of su(2 ) njl model with large @xmath0 expansion .",
