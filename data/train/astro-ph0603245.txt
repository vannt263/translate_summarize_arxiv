    "the multiwavelength survey by yale - chile is unique for its combination of depth and total area , for providing the @xmath3 photometry needed for high - quality photometric redshifts over 1.2 square degrees of sky , and for having additional coverage at x - ray , uv , mid- and far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the primary goal is to study the properties and interrelations of galaxies at a single epoch corresponding to redshift @xmath4 , using a range of selection techniques .",
    "lyman break galaxies at @xmath5 are selected through their dropout in @xmath6-band images combined with blue continuua typical of recent star formation at @xmath7 in the rest - frame @xcite detected in @xmath8 .",
    "imaging depths of @xmath6,@xmath9,@xmath10,@xmath11 were chosen to detect the lbgs , whose luminosity function has a characteristic magnitude of @xmath12 in @xmath13 , and to find their lyman break decrement in the @xmath6 filter via colors @xmath14 .",
    "lyman @xmath15 emitters at @xmath5 are selected through additional deep narrow - band imaging using a 50 fwhm filter centered at 5000 .",
    "these objects can be detected in narrow - band imaging and spectroscopy by their emission lines , allowing us to probe to much dimmer continuum magnitudes than possible for lyman break galaxies .",
    "it has recently become clear that optical selection methods do not provide a full census of the galaxy population at @xmath16 , as they miss objects which are faint in the rest - frame ultraviolet @xcite . with this in mind , musyc has a comprehensive near - infrared imaging campaign .",
    "the nir imaging comprises two components : a wide survey covering the full square degree and a deep survey of the central @xmath17 of each field .",
    "the @xmath18 point source sensitivities of the wide and deep components are @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "nir imaging over the full survey area provides a critical complement to optical imaging for breaking degeneracies in photometric redshifts and modeling star formation histories .",
    "deeper @xmath21 imaging over @xmath17 subfields opens up an additional window into the @xmath22 universe as the @xmath23 selection technique @xcite are used to find evolved optically - red galaxies at @xmath24 through their rest - frame balmer/4000 break .",
    "in addition to the optical and near - infrared , imaging campaigns at other wavelengths and follow - up spectroscopy are integral parts of musyc .",
    "x - ray selection is used to study agn demographics over the full range of accessible redshifts , @xmath25 , ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with spitzer imaging used to detect optically- and x - ray - obscured agn @xcite .",
    "this also allows a census of accreting black holes at @xmath5 in the same fields to study correlations between black hole accretion and galaxy properties at this epoch .",
    "multiple epochs of optical imaging are being used to conduct a proper motion survey to find white dwarfs and brown dwarfs in order to study galactic structure and the local initial mass function ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the four survey fields ( see table  [ tab : fields ] ) were chosen to have extremely low reddening , h  i column density @xcite , and 100@xmath26 m dust emission @xcite .",
    "additionally , each field satisfies all of the following criteria : minimal bright foreground sources in the optical and radio , high galactic latitude ( @xmath27 ) to reduce stellar density , and accessibility from observatories located in chile .",
    "the survey fields will be a natural choice for future observations with alma .",
