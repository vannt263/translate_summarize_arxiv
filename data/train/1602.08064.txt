    "multipartite entanglement for homogeneous systems of @xmath1-qudit systems , i.e. , pure states belonging to a hilbert space @xmath2 , has been thoroughly studied @xcite .",
    "in particular , graph states @xcite provide many classes of entangled states , including the maximally entangled ones .    in a more general setup ,",
    "quantum states belong to a hilbert space of the form @xmath3 , where the local hilbert spaces @xmath4 have possibly different dimensions .",
    "such a hilbert space contains quantum states associated to _",
    "systems , having different number of levels . for brevity we will refer to such systems as @xmath5 .",
    "investigation of entanglement in heterogeneous systems was recently performed in several particular cases , e.g. for tri - partite systems , @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath7 @xcite , and for four - partite systems , @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "a key problem for characterizing entanglement in heterogeneous systems is the lack of a suitable mathematical tool  for instance the galois fields do not exist in non - prime power dimensions .",
    "therefore , the study of entanglement for heterogeneous systems is even more challenging than for the homogeneous case .",
    "properties of quantum entanglement for heterogeneous bipartite systems are well understood , whereas the complexity of the analogous problem for tripartite systems becomes intractable in general .",
    "it has been proven that the problem of calculating the rank of a tensor with three indices over any finite field is np - complete with respect to the dimension of the tensor @xcite .",
    "the codification of information in the orbital angular momentum of photons is a resource to generate an unbounded number of discrete levels @xcite .",
    "this technique has allowed one to improve classical @xcite and quantum @xcite communication protocols . remarkably , taking into account subsystems consisting of more than two levels each ,",
    "improves security of some quantum information protocols @xcite , increases capacity of quantum channels @xcite and efficiency of quantum gates @xcite .",
    "recently , experimentalists paid attention to the entanglement of different degrees of freedom ( e.g. path - polarization ) and successfully generated a _",
    "qubit - qutrit _ hyperentangled state @xcite .",
    "additionally , a three partite state composed of one _ qubit _ and two _ qutrits _ exhibiting genuinely multipartite entanglement was generated in laboratory @xcite .",
    "these results provide a motivation to study protection of entanglement in heterogeneous systems under decoherence @xcite .",
    "it is fair to expect that multipartite entangled states of heterogeneous systems consisting of several qubits and qutrits will be implemented in a near future .",
    "however , the theory of quantum entanglement in heterogeneous systems consisting of several subsystems of different sizes is by far not complete .",
    "the main aim of this work is to provide a concrete contribution in this direction by considering mixed orthogonal arrays .    a pure mutipartite state of a system containing @xmath1 subsystems",
    "is called @xmath9uniform if every density matrix reduced to @xmath9 subsystems is maximally mixed @xcite .",
    "such states are also called maximally multipartite entangled @xcite and can be considered as multipartite generalizations of the two  qubit bell state .",
    "maximally entangled states of homogeneous systems consisting of @xmath1 subsystems of @xmath10 levels each are closely related to quantum error correcting codes for messages encoded in an alphabet consisting of @xmath10 letters @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such states are useful for quantum secret sharing protocol @xcite and to design holographic quantum codes @xcite .",
    "highly entangled @xmath9uniform multipartite states can be constructed from graph states @xcite , orthogonal arrays @xcite , mutually orthogonal latin squares and latin cubes @xcite and symmetric matrices @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we consider an extension of orthogonal arrays , known as _",
    "mixed orthogonal arrays _ ( moa ) @xcite , which allows us to construct genuinely multipartite maximally entangled states for heterogeneous systems , related to quantum error correction codes over mixed alphabets @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section ii we establish a link between mixed orthogonal arrays and multipartite entanglement for heterogeneous systems . additionally , the central concept of _ irredundant moa _ is introduced together with basic properties and clarifying examples . in section iii , two powerful constructions to generate irredundant moa are shown .",
    "these constructions allow us to generate maximally entangled states for a wide range of heterogeneous systems .",
    "in particular , we prove the existence of 1-uniform and 2-uniform states for heterogeneous systems for any number of parties . in section iv",
    ", we exemplify our constructions by presenting explicitly some new quantum states .",
    "furthermore , we show that every quantum state generated by our proposed techniques can be written as linear combination involving orthogonal @xmath11-like states . in section",
    "v we introduce the concept of _ endurance _ of @xmath9 uniformity , which allows us to extend the variety of @xmath9-uniform states that we find . in section",
    "vi , we present some applications of maximally entangled states for heterogeneous systems to quantum steering .",
    "furthermore , we construct the simplest 1-uniform state of this work corresponding to a system of two qubits and one qutrit . in section vii , we discuss main results of the work and present some open questions .",
    "finally , in appendix [ appendixa ] we show how to find maximally entangled states from redundant moa and we exemplify this method by finding a 1-uniform state consisting of one qubit and two qutrits , which is not possible to find from an irredundant moa .",
    "orthogonal arrays provide a fundamental tool to design experiments and are known as _ taguchi designs _ @xcite . in a previous work we studied orthogonal arrays and their relation to maximally entangled states of homogeneous systems consisting of @xmath1 subsystems with @xmath10 levels each @xcite . here",
    ", we consider _ mixed orthogonal arrays _",
    "@xcite , also called asymmetric orthogonal arrays @xcite , which form a natural generalization of orthogonal arrays ( oa ) .",
    "a mixed orthogonal array moa@xmath12 is an array of @xmath13 rows and @xmath1 columns ( @xmath14 array ) , with @xmath15 such that the first @xmath16 columns have symbols from @xmath17 , the next @xmath18 columns have symbols from @xmath19 and so on , with the property that any @xmath20 subarray contains every possible combination of @xmath9 symbols with the same number of appearance .",
    "an oa is a particular case of moa having identical set of symbols in every column , that is , @xmath21 .",
    "the notation considered here for oa and moa was introduced by rao @xcite . for an excellent introduction to orthogonal arrays and their applications",
    "consult the book of hedayat , sloane and stufken @xcite .",
    "orthogonal arrays offer a convenient tool to generate highly entangled states for homogeneous multipartite systems composed of @xmath1 qudits @xcite , including dicke states @xcite , cluster states @xcite and graph states @xcite .",
    "a moa@xmath22 having @xmath23 columns is called _ irredundant _ , written irmoa , if every subset of @xmath24 columns contains a different sequence of @xmath24 symbols in every row .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that an iroa(@xmath25 ) leads to a @xmath9-uniform state of @xmath1 subsystems with @xmath10 levels each . in the present work",
    ", we extend the same idea to the mixed alphabets by considering irmoa(@xmath26 ) @xmath27 which lead to @xmath9uniform states of the system @xmath5 , consisting of @xmath16 subsystems having @xmath28 levels , @xmath18 subsystems having @xmath18 levels and so on . without loss of generality we assume that @xmath29 .",
    "the generated state , denoted as @xmath30 , is of the form @xmath31 for brevity the normalization factors in front of pure states discussed in this work are omitted .",
    "in particular , an iroa(@xmath25 ) , denoted iroa(@xmath32 ) in @xcite , defines a @xmath9-uniform state of a homogeneous system consisting of @xmath1 subsystems with @xmath10 levels each .",
    "this condition means that the partial trace over any selected @xmath24 subsystems forms the maximally mixed state of @xmath9 qudits .    the classes of states that can be constructed from irmoa posses two remarkable properties @xcite : _ ( a ) uniformity : _ every combination of @xmath9 symbols has the same number of appearance along the rows .",
    "this implies that every reduction to @xmath9 qudits , @xmath33 , has a uniform diagonal . _",
    "( b ) diagonality : _ the irredundancy of the moa implies that every reduction @xmath34 to @xmath9 qudits forms a diagonal matrix . in this way , oa and irredundancy are the two conditions sufficient to assure uniformity and diagonality of partial traces .",
    "this in turn implies that the corresponding pure state is @xmath9uniform .",
    "we remark that the same properties hold in the same way for states constructed from irmoa .",
    "let us present some examples .",
    "the array @xmath35 defines the standard bell state , @xmath36 , while @xmath37 yields the ghz state , @xmath38 .    in the case of multilevel systems",
    "we have , for instance @xmath39 which defines a @xmath40uniform state of a system @xmath41 consisting of one ququart and two qubits , @xmath42 ) is listed in the on - line catalog of moa of strength 2 provided by kuhfeld @xcite .",
    "however , state ( [ ame2231 ] ) does not capture the aim of our goal .",
    "note that the ququart in the state ( [ ame2231 ] ) can be decomposed into two qubits in order to get a 1-uniform state of 4 qubits systems : @xmath43 where we considered the identification : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . by this reason , in the rest of the work we will be mainly focused on _ genuinely heterogeneous systems _",
    ", i.e. , systems composed of subsystems with coprime levels ( e.g. qubits - qutrits or qutrits - ququints ) . these kind of heterogeneous systems can not be transformed into homogeneous systems by an identification of symbols , like the one used for the state ( [ ame2231 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we provide a general framework to construct irmoa which represents a natural tool to generate genuinely multipartite entangled states for heterogeneous systems with an arbitrary number of parties . in the previous work @xcite we used the fact that real hadamard matrices",
    "allow one to construct iroa(@xmath48 ) for @xmath49 and suitable values of @xmath13 . from such arrangements we were able to generate 2-uniform states for @xmath49 qubits systems .",
    "here , we generalize this result to irmoa by considering the combinatorial notion of _ difference schemes _ @xcite . a difference scheme @xmath50 is an arrangement having @xmath51 rows , @xmath1 columns and @xmath10 different symbols such that the difference between every pair of rows , with respect to operations in the _ galois field _",
    "@xmath52 , contains the @xmath10 symbols equally often .",
    "thus , there arises the following method to obtain irmoa of strength one from difference schemes .",
    "[ c1 ] if a difference scheme @xmath50 exists then the irmoa(@xmath53 ) exists , where @xmath54 are the @xmath55 distinct prime factors of @xmath56 .",
    "the construction of the irmoa consists in two steps .",
    "first , we consider the difference scheme @xmath50 and the following juxtaposition : @xmath57 where @xmath58 means that every entry of the difference scheme @xmath50 is increased by @xmath59 .",
    "note that the resulting array have to contain @xmath10 different symbols in @xmath52 .",
    "for example , if @xmath10 is prime then the symbols of the arrangement are numbers in @xmath60 and the sum is taken modulo @xmath10",
    ". see appendix [ appendixb ] for the construction when @xmath10 is prime power .",
    "this process generates an iroa(@xmath61 ) .",
    "second , in order to obtain the irmoa(@xmath53 ) we have to add @xmath55 columns @xmath62 with entries @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "let us construct an explicit example from @xmath66 with help of construction [ c1 ] .",
    "we obtain then the irmoa(@xmath67 ) because the only prime factor of 4 is 2 .",
    "this irmoa is in fact the iroa(@xmath68 ) , namely @xmath69 in order to construct a _ genuine irmoa _ we have to consider a difference scheme @xmath50 such that @xmath56 is not the integer power of a prime number .",
    "for example , we can consider @xmath70 and obtain the genuinely mixed orthogonal array irmoa(@xmath71)@xmath72irmoa(@xmath73 ) , @xmath74 let us present a further example",
    ". we shall skip the case @xmath75 as @xmath76 defines an iroa instead of a genuine irmoa .",
    "so , we discuss the larger case , @xmath77 , which leads to mixed orthogonal array irmoa(@xmath78)@xmath72irmoa(@xmath79 ) . that is @xmath80",
    "the above examples can be generalized to any number of columns @xmath1 by considering the difference scheme @xmath81    until now we constructed irredundant mixed orthogonal arrays of strength @xmath82 from difference schemes of the form d(@xmath83 ) .",
    "however , construction 1 also works for more general kinds of difference schemes . here",
    ", we have a remarkable observation : from considering construction [ c1 ] and a difference scheme of the form d(@xmath84 ) we produce a moa of strength 2 @xcite that is irredundant .",
    "this property has a central role in this study and it represents the most important contribution of the present paper .",
    "we consider this special result as a separate construction :    [ c2 ] if a difference scheme @xmath85 exists for @xmath0 then an @xmath86 exists , where @xmath54 are the @xmath55 distinct prime factors of @xmath87 and @xmath10 is a prime power number .",
    "the case @xmath88 implies @xmath10=2 and it does not work here because the number of columns of the resulting irmoa is three and this array is too small to assure irredundancy .",
    "this case generates the 1-uniform state of eq.([iroa222 ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that if @xmath10 is prime then the irmoa arising from construction [ c2 ] are given in the same way as construction [ c1 ] .",
    "however , if @xmath10 is a prime power then we have to consider the galois field @xmath52 ( see appendix [ appendixb ] ) .",
    "otherwise the irmoa only has strength @xmath82 .",
    "it worth noting that a class of difference schemes of the form @xmath89 can be generated from the fourier matrix @xmath90 of prime dimension @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 denotes the entry of @xmath89 located at the @xmath59-th row and @xmath9-th column .",
    "furthermore , @xmath94 is generated from the tensor product of @xmath55 fourier matrices @xmath95 .",
    "let us present some examples of construction [ c2 ] by considering some of these difference schemes . from @xmath96",
    "we note that there is a single prime factor of @xmath97 , so we can generate the irmoa(@xmath98)@xmath72iroa(@xmath99 ) .",
    "that is , @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes transposition .",
    "analogously , from difference scheme @xmath102 we get irmoa(@xmath103 ) given by @xmath104 see appendix [ appendixb ] for an explicit construction . here , this irmoa can be transformed into iroa(@xmath105 ) .",
    "therefore , examples ( [ iroa9432 ] ) and ( [ iroa16442 ] ) lead us to oa instead of genuinely mixed oa .",
    "the simplest genuine irmoa arises for difference scheme @xmath106 , as @xmath107 is not a power of a prime .",
    "this difference scheme can be found in the online catalog of kuhfeld @xcite . to save the space",
    "we will not write here the resulting irmoa(@xmath108)@xmath72irmoa(@xmath109 ) , but in section [ s_qs ] we construct the associated quantum state .",
    "we would like to stress that orthogonal arrays are simple to construct from difference schemes @xmath50 when the number of symbols @xmath10 is prime .",
    "in this case , the symbols to be considered are elements of the group @xmath60 and the difference operation is taken modulo @xmath10 , as we showed along the work . however , when @xmath10 is a prime power the construction of orthogonal arrays from difference schemes requires to use galois fields . in appendix [ appendixb ]",
    "we exemplify the construct with galois fields by constructing the irredundant orthogonal array oa(16,4,4,2 ) , and the corresponding quantum state , from the difference scheme @xmath110 .",
    "before constructing @xmath9-uniform states related to irmoa it is interesting to study the maximal values of the strength @xmath9 allowed for systems @xmath111 . for homogeneous systems consisting of @xmath1 qudits having @xmath10 levels each the upper bound is @xmath112 .",
    "the states saturating this inequality are called _ absolutely maximally entangled _",
    "( ame ) @xcite .",
    "for example , bell states are ame for two qubit systems . for",
    "a general @xmath113 system with @xmath114 ame states do not exist .",
    "this is because the von neumann entropies of the reduced density matrices @xmath115 and @xmath116 are equal , so that both reductions of different dimensions can not be maximally mixed .",
    "following the same argument , @xmath9-uniform states consisting of @xmath117 heterogeneous subsystems do not exist @xcite . despite this fact",
    ", there is a place for a wide range of @xmath9-uniform states with @xmath118 . to get a more precise upper bound for @xmath9 note that for a system @xmath119 , 1-uniform states do not exist if @xmath28 is larger than the dimension of the complementary system , i.e. , @xmath120 . in general ,",
    "a @xmath9-uniform state do not exist if the product of the size of @xmath9 local hilbert spaces is larger than the dimension of the complementary system .",
    "this result can be stated as follows : a necessary condition for the existence of a @xmath9 uniform state of a system @xmath111 is @xmath121 where @xmath122 . here",
    ", we recall the already assumed convention , @xmath29 . in the particular case of @xmath1 qudits with @xmath10 levels each eq.([ineq ] ) reduces to the standard bound , @xmath112 .",
    "furthermore , a @xmath9-uniform state consisting of @xmath123 qutrits and @xmath18 qubits satisfies the bound @xmath124 for any @xmath18 .",
    "let us now to construct 1-uniform and 2-uniform states applying constructions [ c1 ] and [ c2 ] , respectively .",
    "we start by considering the 1-uniform state of 3 qubits arising from iroa(@xmath68 ) of eq.([iroa222 ] ) which is accidentally homogeneous , @xmath125 here , we followed the identification between irmoa and quantum states given in eq.([array ] ) and eq.([pure2 ] ) , where states are not normalized .",
    "a genuinely heterogeneous maximally entangled state arises from the array irmoa(@xmath126 ) of eq.([irmoa3321 ] ) , which allows us to obtain the 1-uniform state of the system @xmath127 : @xmath128 additionally , irmoa(@xmath79 ) , explicitly written in ( [ irmoa5521 ] ) yields the 1-uniform state of the system @xmath129 , @xmath130 states ( [ phi3421 ] ) and ( [ phi5521 ] ) can be generalized for any number of parties by considering the difference scheme @xmath131 defined in eq.([diffsche ] ) .",
    "thus , we generate the following 1-uniform state , @xmath132_{p_1}\\dots [ 2l+j]_{p_m}\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath133_a = x\\,(\\mathrm{mod}\\,a)$ ] and @xmath134 are the @xmath55 distinct prime factors of @xmath135 .",
    "furthermore , construction [ c2 ] allows us to generate 2-uniform states .",
    "the simplest cases arise from iroa(@xmath99 ) , irmoa(@xmath103)@xmath72iroa(@xmath105 ) and iroa(@xmath136 ) .",
    "these arrangements generate 2-uniform states of homogeneous systems : 4 qutrits , 9 qubits and 6 ququints , respectively .",
    "two uniform states characterizing genuine heterogeneous systems are associated to difference schemes @xmath85 such that @xmath87 is not a power of a prime .",
    "the simplest heterogeneous case arises from @xmath106 which leads to irmoa(@xmath137)@xmath72irmoa(@xmath138 ) and generates the 2-uniform state of the system @xmath139 : @xmath140 in the same way , the difference scheme @xmath141 implies the array irmoa(@xmath142)@xmath72irmoa(@xmath143 ) , which produces the state of the system @xmath144 :    @xmath145    from @xmath146 we generate irmoa(@xmath147)@xmath72irmoa(@xmath148 ) and thus a state of the system @xmath149 , @xmath150    there exist a useful compact way to write every state arising from construction [ c1 ] and [ c2 ] . introducing the shift operator , @xmath151_d\\rangle,\\ ] ] the ghz state of @xmath1 subsystems with @xmath10 levels each , @xmath152 )",

    "the @xmath156 states are convex combinations of ghz  like rank - one projectors @xmath157 , whereas here we consider superpositions of ghz  like vectors @xmath158 .",
    "in section [ s_qs ] we generated @xmath9-uniform states for heterogeneous systems by considering irmoa . here , we show that some columns of irmoa can be removed without loosing the irredundancy of the orthogonal array in question .",
    "as consequence , from the @xmath9-uniform state @xmath159 we are able to generate the family of @xmath9-uniform states @xmath160 , where @xmath161 and @xmath55 is the number of distinct primes factors of @xmath162 . here , the number @xmath163 is called _ endurance of k - uniformity _ and it represents the maximal number of columns of an irmoa that can be removed so that the remaining moa preserves both irredundancy and strength @xmath9 .",
    "it is important to stress that the @xmath164 columns to be removed have to contain exactly @xmath10 different symbols .",
    "otherwise , the endurance of @xmath9-uniformity would be not univocally defined .",
    "observe that the action of removing a column in an irmoa is not related to a local measurement performed by a given party .",

    "@xcite , which represents the minimal number of parties that should make a local measurement in order to assure that the remaining state is a fully separable .    indeed , by removing @xmath165 columns of the iroa(@xmath166 we get the iroa(2,@xmath167 .",
    "this operation can be associated to a mapping of the ghz state of @xmath1 qubits into the bell state .",
    "thus , the iroa(2,@xmath168,1 ) has endurance of 1-uniformity @xmath169 , as 1-uniformity remains after removing @xmath165 columns of the iroa .",
    "on the other hand , any local measurement on a system prepared in a ghz state of @xmath1 parties lead us to a fully separable state , so the ghz state has persistency of entanglement @xmath170 for any number of parties @xmath1 .",
