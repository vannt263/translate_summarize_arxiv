    "during the failure process of composite materials under external load , avalanches of different magnitudes are produced , where an avalanche consists of simultaneous rupture of several elements .",
    "such avalanches cause a sudden internal stress redistribution in the material , and are accompanied by a rapid release of mechanical energy . a useful experimental technique to monitor the energy release is to measure the acoustic emissions , the elastically radiated waves produced in the bursts @xcite .",
    "fiber bundles with statistically distributed thresholds for breakdown of individual fibers are interesting models of failure processes in materials .",
    "they are characterized by simple geometry and clear - cut rules for how stress caused by a failed element is redistributed on the intact fibers .",
    "the interest of these models lies in the possibility of obtaining exact results , thereby providing inspiration and reference systems for studies of more complicated materials .",
    "( for reviews , see @xcite ) . the statistical distribution of the _ size _ of avalanches in fiber bundles is well studied @xcite , but the distribution of the burst _ energies _ is not . in this article we therefore determine the statistics of the energies released in fiber bundle avalanches .",
    "we study equal - load - sharing models , in which the load previously carried by a failed fiber is shared equally by all the remaining intact fibers in the bundle @xcite .",
    "we consider a bundle consisting of a large number @xmath2 of elastic fibers , clamped at both ends .",
    "the fibers obey hooke s law , such that the energy stored in a single fiber at elongation @xmath3 equals @xmath4 , where we for simplicity have set the elasticity constant equal to unity .",
    "each fiber @xmath5 is associated with a breakdown threshold @xmath6 for its elongation .",
    "when the length exceeds @xmath6 the fiber breaks immediately , and does not contribute to the strength of the bundle thereafter .",
    "the individual tresholds @xmath6 are assumed to be independent random variables with the same cumulative distribution function @xmath7 and a corresponding density function @xmath8 : @xmath9        fig",
    ".  1 . the fiber bundle model .",
    "+    at an elongation @xmath3 the total force on the bundle is @xmath3 times the number of intact fibers .",
    "the average , or macroscopic , force is given by the expectation value of this , @xmath10.\\ ] ] in the generic case @xmath11 will have a single maximum @xmath12 , a critical load corresponding to the maximum load the bundle can sustain before complete breakdown of the whole system .",
    "the maximum occurs at a critical value @xmath13 for which @xmath14 vanishes .",
    "thus @xmath13 satisfies @xmath15",
    "let us characterize a burst by the number @xmath16 of fibers that fail , and by the lowest threshold value @xmath3 among the @xmath16 failed fibers .",
    "the treshold value @xmath17 of the strongest fiber in the burst can be estimated to be @xmath18 since the expected number of fibers with thresholds in an interval @xmath19 is given by the threshold distribution function as @xmath20 .",
    "the last term in ( [ xmax ] ) is of the order @xmath21 , so for a very large bundle the differences in threshold values among the failed fibers in one burst are negligible . hence the energy released in a burst of size @xmath16 that starts with a fiber with threshold @xmath3",
    "is given with sufficient accuracy as @xmath22    in a statistical analysis of the burst process hemmer and hansen @xcite calculated the expected number of bursts of size @xmath16 , starting at a fiber with a threshold value in the interval @xmath23 , as @xmath24 with the abbreviation @xmath25 the expected number of bursts with energies less than @xmath0 is therefore @xmath26 with a corresponding energy density @xmath27 explicitly , @xmath28 with @xmath29^{n}.\\label{gn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath30    with a critical threshold value @xmath13 , it follows from ( [ en ] ) that a burst energy @xmath0 can only be obtained if @xmath16 is sufficiently large , @xmath31 thus the sum over @xmath16 starts with @xmath32,\\ ] ] here @xmath33 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath34 .",
    "we discuss now both the high - energy and the low - energy behavior of the energy density @xmath35 .      bursts with high energies correspond to bursts in which many fibers rupture . in this range",

    "note that the asymptotic distribution of the burst magnitudes @xmath16 is governed by the same exponent @xcite .",
    "the low - energy behavior of the burst distribution is by no means universal : @xmath35 may diverge , vanish or stay constant as @xmath65 , depending on the nature of the threshold distribution . in fig .",

    "the graphs are based on 1000 samples with @xmath63 fibers in each bundle .",
    "+    we see that @xmath35 approaches a finite limit in the weibull @xmath59 case , approaches zero for weibull @xmath66 and apparently diverges in the uniform case .",
    "all this is easily understood , since bursts with low energy predominently correspond to single fiber bursts ( @xmath67 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath68 ) and to fibers with low threshold values .",
    "the number of bursts with energy less than @xmath0 therefore corresponds to the number of bursts with @xmath69 , which is close to @xmath70 .",
    "this gives @xmath71 for the uniform distribution @xmath35 should therefore diverge as @xmath72 for @xmath65 .",
    "the simulation results in fig .",
    "4 are consistent with this divergence .",
    "for the weibull of index 2 , on the other hand , ( [ enull ] ) gives @xmath73 when @xmath65 , a value in agreement with simulation results in the figure .",
    "note that for a weibull distribution of index @xmath74 , the low - energy behavior is @xmath75 .",
    "thus the weibull with @xmath59 is a borderline case between divergence and vanishing of the low - energy density .",
    "the same lowest - order results can be obtained from the general expression ( [ g ] ) , which also can provide more detailed low - energy expansions .",
    "in the present article we have studied the distribution of burst energies during the failure process in fiber bundles with statistically distributed thresholds for breakdown of individual fibers .",
    "we have derived an exact expression for the energy density distribution @xmath35 , and shown that for high energies the energy density obeys a power law with exponent @xmath64 .",
