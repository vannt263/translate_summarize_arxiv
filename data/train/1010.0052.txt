    "during the past decade , neutrino oscillation experiments have provided us with very convincing evidence that neutrinos are massive particles mixing with each other [ 1 ] . moreover ,",
    "their masses are extremely small , while mixing is nearly maximal , which means that the lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) processes are allowed .",
    "however , it is well known that , in the standard model ( sm ) , neutrinos are massless and the lfv processes are not allowed at tree level .",
    "thus , the exciting experimental fact opens a window to new physics beyond the sm [ 2 ] .",
    "in fact , lepton flavor symmetry is an accidental symmetry at low energy , and it may be violated beyond the sm .",
    "many kinds of popular specific models , like supersymmetry , technicolor , and little higgs models , indicate the possibility of large lfv . therefore , an lfv signal in the charged lepton sector would be a clear hint for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "experimental detection of the lfv phenomenon can provide an evidence of new physics .",
    "searching for new physics beyond the sm is one of the most important issues of current particle physics .",
    "the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) can generate very massive new particles and will essentially enlarge the possibilities of testing for new physics effects .",
    "however , the lhc is a hadronic machine and precision measurements will be quite hard to undertake there . also , the existence of large backgrounds at the lhc may hinder discoveries of new physical phenomena already possible at the energies that this accelerator will achieve .",
    "thus , the next generation @xmath6 international linear collider ( ilc ) with the center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy @xmath7 and the typical integrated luminosity @xmath8 @xmath9 is currently being designed [ 3 , 4 ] .",
    "because of its rather clean environment and high luminosity , the ilc will allow unambiguous precision measurements .",
    "in such a collider , in addition to @xmath6 collision , one can also realize @xmath10 collision with the photon beams generated by the backward compton scattering of incident electron- and laser- beams .",
    "the @xmath10 collision offers a unique opportunity to explore new physics effects through production mechanisms which are not accessible in leptonic or hadronic machines [ 5 ] .",
    "it is well known that many popular models beyond the sm predict the presence of new particles , such as new gauge bosons , new fermions , and new scalars , which can generally enhance the branching ratios for some lfv decay processes , for instance @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "the upper experimental limits for some of these lfv decay processes can give serve constraints on the corresponding new physics models . nevertheless , it is possible that the lfv signals may be observed at the ilc .",
    "this fact has lead to lot of work to study the lfv processes @xmath14 and @xmath4 in the framework of specific models beyond the sm [ 6 , 7 ] and in a model - independent manner [ 8 ] . taking into account the constraints of the upper experimental limits for some lfv decay processes on the littlest higgs model with @xmath0 parity ( called the lht model ) [ 9 ] , in this paper ,",
    "we will focus our attention on its contributions to the lfv processes @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we calculate the production cross sections of these processes induced by the lht model and discuss the possibility of detecting the lfv signals of the lht model via @xmath6 and @xmath10 collisions at the ilc .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly review the essential features of the lht model , which are related our calculation . a simple discussion about the constraints on the lht model from some lfv decay processes is also given in this section .",
    "the production cross sections of the lfv processes @xmath3 and @xmath4 are calculated in secs .",
    "iii and iv , respectively .",
    "finally , the conclusions are given in sec . v.",
    "little higgs theory [ 10 ] was proposed as an alternative solution to the hierarchy problem of the sm , which provides a possible kind of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) mechanism accomplished by a naturally light higgs boson . in order to make the littlest higgs model consistent with electroweak precision tests and simultaneously having the new particles of this model in the reach of the lhc ,",
    "a discrete symmetry , t - parity , has been introduced , which forms the lht model .",
    "the detailed description of the lht model can be found for instance in refs.[9,11,12 ] , and here we just want to briefly review its essential features , which are related to our calculation .",
    "the lht model is based on an @xmath15 global symmetry breaking pattern . a subgroup @xmath16_{1}\\times [ su(2)\\times u(1)]_{2}$ ] of the @xmath17 global symmetry is gauged , and at the scale @xmath18 it is broken into the sm electroweak symmetry @xmath19 .",
    "t - parity exchanges the @xmath20_{1}$ ] and @xmath16_{2}$ ] gauge symmetries .",
    "the t - even combinations of the gauge fields are the sm electroweak gauge bosons @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath0-odd combinations are t - parity partners of the sm electroweak gauge bosons .    after taking into account ewsb , at the order of @xmath23 , the masses of the @xmath0-odd set of the @xmath24 gauge bosons",
    "are given as @xmath25,\\hspace{0.5cm}m_{z_{h}}\\approx m_{w_{h}}=g_{2}f[1-\\frac{v^{2}}{8f^{2}}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the electroweak scale and @xmath18 is the scale parameter of the gauge symmetry breaking of the lht model , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the sm @xmath29 and @xmath30 gauge coupling constants , respectively .",
    "a consistent implementation of t - parity also requires the introduction of mirror fermions  one for each quark and lepton species .",
    "the masses of the @xmath0-odd ( mirror ) fermions can be written in a unified manner : @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the eigenvalues of the mass matrix @xmath33 and their values are generally dependent on the fermion species @xmath34 .",
    "these new fermions ( @xmath0-odd quarks and @xmath0-odd leptons ) have new flavor violating interactions with the sm fermions mediated by the new gauge bosons ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) and at higher order by the triplet scalar @xmath37 .",
    "these interactions are governed by new mixing matrices @xmath38 and @xmath39 for down - type quarks and charged leptons , respectively .",
    "the corresponding matrices in the up - type quarks ( @xmath40 ) and neutrino ( @xmath41 ) sectors are obtained by means of the relations : @xmath42 where the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xmath43 is defined through flavor mixing in the down - type quark sector , while the pmns matrix @xmath44 is defined through neutrino mixing .",
    "the feynman rules of the lht model have been studied in ref.[12 ] and the corrected feynman rules of ref.[12 ] are given in refs.[13 , 14 ] . to simplify our paper , we do not list them here .    from the above discussions , we can see that the flavor structure of the lht model is much richer than the one of the sm , mainly due to the presence of three doublets of mirror quarks and leptons and their interactions with the ordinary quarks and leptons .",
    "such new flavor changing interactions can induce that the lht model generates contributions to some flavor changing processes .",
    "the contributions of the lht model to the lfv decay processes have been extensively studied and compared with current experimental limits in the literature [ 14,15,16 ] .",
    "it has been shown that the lht model can enhance the sm prediction values by several orders of magnitude and the experimental measurement data for some lfv decay processes can give serve constraints on the free parameters of the lht model .",
    "the new particles predicted by the lht model can generate significative contributions to the lfv decay process @xmath45 via box diagrams and the effective vertices @xmath46 generated by @xmath47 and @xmath48penguins , while only via @xmath47 penguin for the lfv decay process @xmath49 [ 14 , 15 ] . in order to suppress the values of the branching ratios @xmath50 and @xmath51 predicted by the lht model below the present experimental upper bounds , the relevant mixing matrix @xmath39 must be rather hierarchical or mass splitting for the first and second @xmath0-odd lepton masses is very small .",
    "reference [ 15 ] has shown that , for @xmath52 , the mass splitting @xmath53 must satisfy @xmath54 and @xmath55 for assuming @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively , in which @xmath58 is the mass of the @xmath34-th generation @xmath0-odd lepton .",
    "it is should be noted that the value of @xmath59 increases as the scale parameter @xmath18 increases .",
    "however , the present experimental upper bounds for @xmath45 and @xmath1 can not give significative constraints on the mass of the third @xmath0-odd lepton generation .",
    "thus , in this paper , we will assume @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in our following numerical estimation",
    ", we take the mass parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and the scale parameter @xmath18 as free parameters .",
    "from above discussions we can see that the lht model can contribute to the lfv processes @xmath14 ( @xmath5 ) via the effective vertices @xmath64 and the box diagrams .",
    "the feynman diagrams for the lfv processes @xmath14 are depicted in fig.1 , in which @xmath65 and @xmath66 represent the would be goldstone bosons arising from the lht model .",
    "it is obvious that the contributions of the lht model to this process mainly come from the effective vertices @xmath64 [ fig.1(a)fig.1(k ) ] , which are related the lfv processes @xmath45 and @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the production cross sections of the processes @xmath3 should also be constrained by the present experimental upper bounds of these processes . however , as shown in refs.[14 , 15 ] , as long as @xmath67 , the lht model can satisfy the constrains from @xmath45 and @xmath1 .",
    "the constraints on other free parameters , such as the mass @xmath63 of the third @xmath0-odd lepton generation , the mixing matrix elements @xmath68 , etc .",
    "are very weak .",
    "so , it is possible that the lht model can give sizable cross sections for the processes @xmath3 .",
    "our calculation has shown that it is indeed this case .",
    "the one - loop calculation can be carried out by summing all of these one - loop diagrams and the results will be finite and gauge invariant .",
    "each loop diagram is composed of some scalar loop functions , which are calculated by using @xmath69 [ 17 ] . in the following sections , we will use the @xmath70 @xmath71-feynman gauge to calculate their production cross sections . because the calculation of the loop diagrams is too tedious and the analytical expressions are lengthy",
    ", we will not present them here .",
    "it is obvious that , except for the sm input parameters @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 [ 18 ] , the production cross sections @xmath75 for the lfv processes @xmath3 are dependent on the model dependent parameters @xmath68 , @xmath18 , and the @xmath0-odd leptons masses .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath68 can be determined through @xmath76 . to avoid any additional parameters introduced and to simplify our calculations , we take @xmath56 , which means that @xmath77 and the @xmath0-odd leptons have no effects on the flavor violating observable in the neutrino sector [ 14 , 19 ] .",
    "certainly , this is a very limited scenario .",
    "however , in order to satisfy the constraints from @xmath45 and @xmath1 , the mixing matrix @xmath39 must be rather hierarchical or the first and second @xmath0-odd lepton masses are quasidegenerate .",
    "therefor , in this paper , we take @xmath78 and @xmath56 might be suitable . for the pmns matrix @xmath44 , we take the standard parametrization form with parameters given by the neutrino experiments [ 20 ] . since there is not constraints on the pmns phases , we will take the dirac phase to be equal to the ckm phase and set the two majorana phases to zero in our numerical estimations .    ( -110,-5 ) * * ( -102,-5 ) ( -335,-5 )    our numerical results are summarized in fig.2 , in which we plot the production cross sections @xmath79 as functions of the mass parameter @xmath63 for @xmath80 and three values of the scale parameter @xmath18 .",
    "figures(a ) , fig.2(b ) and fig.2(c ) are corresponding to the lfv processes @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "in these figures , we have taken the c. m. energy @xmath84 .",
    "one can see from fig.2 that the contributions of the lht model to the lfv processes @xmath3 ( @xmath5 ) increase as the third family @xmath0-odd lepton mass @xmath63 increases and the scale parameter @xmath18 decreases . in most of the parameter space ,",
    "the production cross sections for the states @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are approximately at the same order of magnitude . for @xmath84 , @xmath80 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , there are @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively",
    ". if we assume the integrated luminosity @xmath93 , there will be several tens and up to thousands of @xmath94 events to be generated in the future ilc experiments .    to see the effect of the first and second generation @xmath0-odd lepton masses on the production cross sections @xmath75 , in fig.3 , we plot @xmath75 as functions of the mass parameter @xmath62 for @xmath52 and @xmath95 .",
    "from fig.3 one can see that the contributions of the lht model to the lfv processes @xmath3 also increase as the mass parameter @xmath62 . for @xmath95 , @xmath52 , @xmath96 and @xmath84 , they are @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively .    it is well known that , at the ilc , the lfv production processes can provide extremely clear signatures and are experimentally interesting .",
    "for the three lfv processes",
    "@xmath100 , @xmath82 and @xmath101 , the final leptons always emerge back to back and carrying a constant energy which is one - half of the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath102 .",
    "the last process is the best one and almost free of the sm backgrounds .",
    "for the first and second production processes , we can assume the lepton tau decay @xmath103 and @xmath104 , which give rise to the signal events with opposite - sign and different - flavor leptons and missing energy ( @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) .",
    "although this kind of lfv signal is quite spectacular , it is not free of the sm backgrounds .",
    "for example , the leading backgrounds of the signal @xmath107 mainly come from the sm processes @xmath108 and @xmath109 , which have been discussed in ref.[8 ] .",
    "they have shown that , with suitable cuts , the sm backgrounds can be largely suppressed .",
    "thus , it is possible to observe the lfv signal of the lht model in the future ilc experiments .",
    "certainly , detailed study of the relevant backgrounds is needed , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "it is well known that the ilc could offer the possibility of working in the @xmath10 or @xmath110 collision thus realizing a very high energy photon collider [ 5 ] .",
    "for some production processes , their cross sections at the @xmath10 collider might be larger than the corresponding @xmath6 ones ; this collider will reveal crucial information about these production processes . to see whether the lht model can give significant contributions to the lfv final states @xmath111 ( @xmath5 ) via @xmath10 collision",
    ", we will consider the lfv processes @xmath112 in this section .    from the discussions given in sec.ii , we can see that the lht model can only induce the lfv processes @xmath113 at loop level .",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams are shown in fig.4 .",
    "the feynman diagrams created by exchanging the initial photons , which are not shown in fig.4 , are also involved in our calculations .",
    "we use @xmath114 to denote the scattering angle between one of the photons and one of the final leptons .",
    "then , in the center of mass ( c.m . ) system , we express all the four - momenta of the initial and final particles by means of the @xmath10 c.m .",
    "energy @xmath115 and the scattering angle @xmath114 . the four - momentum components ( @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 ) of final particles @xmath120 and @xmath121 can be written as @xmath122    where @xmath123 .",
    "the mandelstam variables are defined as @xmath124    where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the 4-momenta of the initial photons , which can be written as @xmath127 and @xmath128 . with the above definitions",
    ", we can give the renormalized amplitudes of the lfv processes @xmath129 . to simplify our paper",

    "energy ; @xmath136 is the photon - beam luminosity distribution , which is defined as @xmath137 for the initial unpolarized electron and laser - photon beams , the energy spectrum of the backscattered photon is given by [ 21 ] @xmath138\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath139 where @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 are the incident electron mass and energy , respectively .",

    "( -110,-5 ) * * ( -102,-5 ) ( -335,-5 )    similarly with sec.iii , we also assume @xmath150 and that the masses of the first generation @xmath0-odd fermions are equal to those of the second generation @xmath0-odd fermions . in this case ,",
    "our numerical results are summarized in figs.5 and fig.6 .",
    "figure 5 plots the effective production cross sections @xmath75 as functions of the mass parameter @xmath63 for @xmath80 and three values of the scale parameter @xmath18 , while fig.6 plots the cross sections @xmath75 as functions of @xmath62 for @xmath151 and @xmath95 .",
    "one can see from these figures that , in most of the parameter space , the contributions of the lht model to the lfv processes @xmath152 are smaller than those for the lfv processes @xmath153 . with the increasing of the mass parameter @xmath154 and the decreasing of the scale parameter @xmath18 ,",
    "the effective cross sections of the lfv processes @xmath112 become larger .",
    "such a behavior is similar to that for the lfv processes @xmath155 . for @xmath84 , @xmath80 , @xmath156 and @xmath89 , there are @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 , respectively .",
    "there will be several tens of @xmath94 events to be generated in the future ilc experiment with @xmath93 and @xmath84 .",
    "similar with the lfv process @xmath101 , the lfv process @xmath160 is almost free of the sm background . for",
    "the lfv processes @xmath161 and @xmath162 , the sm backgrounds mainly come from the processes @xmath163 and @xmath164 with the lepton @xmath165 and the electroweak gauge boson @xmath166 leptonic decaying .",
    "it has been shown that , by applying appropriate kinematical cuts , the backgrounds can be significantly suppressed and the ratio of signal to background would be enhanced [ 6 ] .",
    "thus , the lfv signatures of the lht model might have a chance of being observed via the subprocesses @xmath112 in the future ilc experiments .",
    "the lht model is one of the attractive little higgs models . to simultaneously implement @xmath0-parity ,",
    "the lht model introduces new mirror fermions ( @xmath0-odd quarks and @xmath0-odd leptons ) .",
    "the flavor mixing in the mirror fermion sector gives rise to a new source of flavor violation , which might generate significant contributions to some flavor violation processes .",
    "the evidence for the neutrino masses and flavor mixing , which can be seen as the first experimental clue of new physics beyond the sm , implies the nonconservation of the lepton flavor symmetry .",
    "thus , the lfv processes related charged leptons are expected , which are very sensitive to new physics beyond the sm .",
    "taking into account the constraints on the free parameters of the lht model from the rare decay processes @xmath1 and @xmath2 , in this paper , we have considered the contributions of the lht model to the lfv processes @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , which are induced at the one - loop level and will be of interest for the future ilc experiments .",
    "we find that , in wide range of the parameter space , the production cross section of the lfv process @xmath3 can reach several @xmath167 , and that of the lfv process @xmath4 can reach the order of magnitude of @xmath168 .",
    "this means that there will be several and up to thousands of @xmath94 events to be generated each year for the designed luminosity of @xmath93 at the ilc .",
    "since the production rate of these lfv processes predicted by the sm is almost negligible , the observation of such @xmath94 events would be a robust evidence of the lht model .",
    "therefore , these lfv processes may serve as a sensitive probe of the lht model",
    ".    an important tool of the ilc is the use of the polarized beams .",
    "one expects that a high polarization degree between @xmath169 and @xmath170 can be reached [ 3,4 ] .",
    "beam polarization is not only useful for a possible reduction of the background , but might also serve as a possible tool to disentangle different contributions to the signal and to directly analyze the interaction structure of new physics models . in our calculation , we have not considered the polarization of the incident electron .",
    "certainly , if we consider this case , our numerical results will be changed .",
    "furthermore , we can also assume @xmath171 , which makes the values of the production cross sections of the lfv processes @xmath14 different from those for assuming @xmath172",
    ". however , our physical conclusions are not changed .",
    "it is obvious that the production cross sections of the lfv processes @xmath3 and @xmath4 are dependent on the factor @xmath173 with @xmath174 . for assuming @xmath56",
    ", the pmns phases should have effects on these cross sections . in our numerical estimations , we have fixed the values of the pmns phases .",
    "if we vary these values , the numerical results for the cross sections @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 are also changed",
    ". however , these variations are not significantly large .",
    "our physical conclusions are not changed .",
    "the @xmath0-odd quarks predicted by the lht model also have new flavor violating interactions with the sm fermions mediated by the new gauge bosons and at higher order by the triplet scalar .",
    "these interactions are governed by the new mixing matrix @xmath38 for down - quarks .",
    "so the @xmath0-odd quark sector can also generate significant contributions to some flavor changing processes [ 12 , 13 , 22 , 23 ] .",
    "for example , ref.[24 ] has shown that it is possible to test the signatures of the lht model at the ilc and lhc experiments via the flavor changing processes @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "the @xmath0-odd particles predicted by the lht model can only be produced in pairs and give the direct signals at the lhc , which have close resemblance with those of supersymmetry with conserved @xmath181 parity or universal extra dimensions with @xmath182 parity .",
    "the possibility of observing the @xmath0-odd leptons at the lhc has been studied in ref.[25 ] .",
