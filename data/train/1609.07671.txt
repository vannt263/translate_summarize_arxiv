    "the field of ultracold polar molecules has exploded over the past decade as researchers have worked to extend the control offered in ultracold atom experiments producing atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs )  @xcite and degenerate fermi gases ( dfgs )  @xcite to the world of molecules .",
    "heteronuclear molecules have electric dipole moments , and they provide strong , long - range , and anisotropic interactions with precise tunability .",
    "a strong interest has emerged in the scientific community to study systems with long - range interactions .",
    "these systems are ideal candidates for the study of strongly correlated quantum phenomena , as well as for quantum simulation of lattice models relevant to some outstanding problems in condensed - matter physics .",
    "the anisotropic nature of dipolar interactions provides powerful opportunities to control chemical reactions in the low energy regime , and dipolar interactions can also give rise to novel forms of quantum matter such as wigner crystallization  @xcite , @xmath0-wave superfluidity in optical lattices  @xcite , fractional chern insulators  @xcite , and spin - orbit coupling  @xcite .",
    "efforts to produce stable gases of ultracold polar molecules started in the early 2000 s , and are documented in a recent review  @xcite . however , the production of ground - state polar molecules in the quantum regime was a challenging task and it took a major effort to achieve the first success in 2008  @xcite .",
    "the key to the success was the combination of the use of a feshbach resonance for magneto - association of bialkali atoms and coherent optical state transfer via stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) .",
    "feshbach resonances have been studied extensively in the context of controlling atomic interactions via magnetic fields , and they have become one of the most powerful tools for quantum gas experiments .",
    "homonuclear , weakly bound  feshbach \" molecules were produced directly from single - species ultracold atomic samples by using such resonances  @xcite .",
    "in particular , homonuclear feshbach molecules composed of fermionic atoms are themselves bosons , and their production enables studies of a crossover from the bcs - type cooper pairing of fermions into a bec of weakly bound molecules  @xcite . in an optical lattice",
    ", such weakly - bound molecule formation gives rise to quantum zeno suppression of collisions between molecules as they tunnel  @xcite .",
    "work on using the stirap technique to transfer molecules to more deeply bound states was performed on both rb@xmath1",
    "@xcite and cs@xmath1 molecules  @xcite .",
    "however , homonuclear molecules do not have an electric dipole moment , and are thus not useful for studying dipolar scattering or long - range dipole - dipole interactions .    inspired by the work with weakly bound homonuclear molecules , many researchers started producing heteronuclear dimers , involving various combinations of alkali atoms  @xcite .",
    "however , the path to deeply bound , or ground - state , molecules was quite challenging .",
    "the earliest efforts for producing cold polar molecules relied on photoassociation to optically couple free atoms to an excited molecular electronic state , which then spontaneously decays to many rovibrational states in the ground electronic potential . in order to collect the population in the rovibrational ground state",
    ", one can choose an excited state with good franck - condon overlap  @xcite with both the free atom state and the ground rovibrational state  @xcite .",
    "however , the efficiencies for both the excitation from free atoms to an excited molecular state and the subsequent spontaneous decay to a specific rovibrational state in the ground are very low . as a consequence ,",
    "the phase - space density of such cold molecule samples is typically below @xmath2",
    "several more recent experiments have managed to improve on this limitation by using electronically excited states with stronger franck - condon coupling to deeply bound states ( see e.g. references  @xcite ) , but they are not in the rovibrational ground state and the phase - space densities are still very far from reaching the quantum regime",
    ".    alternatively , the coherent transfer approach first adiabatically converts a pair of free atoms of different species into a highly vibrationally excited state in the ground electronic potential using a feshbach resonance , and then couples these feshbach molecules to the rovibrational ground state via an adiabatic raman transfer process through an intermediate electronic excited state .",
    "the first success came in 2008 with the production of heteronuclear fermionic krb molecules  @xcite .",
    "research on deeply bound heteronuclear molecules has exploded in recent years .",
    "several groups have now produced heteronuclear molecules in their deeply bound ground state , in species such as bosonic rbcs  @xcite , fermionic nak  @xcite , and bosonic narb  @xcite .",
    "the fermionic krb molecules recently reached quantum degeneracy  @xcite .",
    "a pair of free atoms can be directly converted to a molecule near the dissociation limit of the ground potential when the bound molecular state ( closed channel ) becomes degenerate in energy with the relative motion of the free atoms at large internuclear separations ( open channel ) .",
    "this type of feshbach resonance exists for essentially all atomic species with a magnetic moment , and the two - channel model for a feshbach resonance is shown in figure  [ fbr1 ] .",
    "since the two channels typically have different magnetic moments , the energy difference between them , @xmath3 , can be adjusted with a magnetic field to realize resonant coupling of the two channels  @xcite .     can be adjusted via a differential zeeman shift using a magnetic field to realize resonant coupling of the two channels .",
    "reproduced with permission from reference  @xcite.,width=288 ]    at a specific field @xmath4 , the energy difference between the closed and open channel vanishes , and the resultant scattering length of the two atoms diverges . tuning @xmath5 away from @xmath4 on the side of the positive scattering length leads to a molecular binding energy @xmath6 , and it is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the reduced mass of the atom pair and @xmath9 is the scattering length of the atoms  @xcite .",

    "[ fbr2]a ) .",
    "typical widths in the most experimentally used resonances are @xmath16 g , although some molecules ( e.g. cs@xmath1  @xcite ) use a resonance width of several mg .    , which is not always the case .",
    "reproduced with permission from reference  @xcite.,width=288 ]    to create feshbach molecules , one typically sweeps @xmath5 across the resonance from the attractive side ( @xmath17 ) to the repulsive side ( @xmath18 ) so that the pair of free atoms adiabatically enters the closed molecular channel .",
    "figure  [ figfbm ] illustrates this process schematically , and also shows the change of the molecular binding energy as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "the free atoms are confined in a harmonic trap , and the different entrance levels correspond to different harmonic oscillator states in the trap . in a fully adiabatic process",
    "only the lowest energy state of the free atoms can couple to the bound channel , in the limit that the harmonic oscillator states are well resolved .",
    "this process can be well described by a landau - zener coupling mechanism , and the probability that free atoms are adiabatically converted to molecules is given by  @xcite : @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the landau - zener parameter , which in a weak harmonic trap is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the harmonic oscillator length of the molecule in the harmonic trap , and @xmath23 is the sweep rate across the resonance .    .",
    "the lowest harmonic oscillator level couples to the feshbach molecule , whose energy reduces below the resonance as @xmath24 . reproduced with permission from reference  @xcite.,width=288 ]    an alternative method to create feshbach molecules is to couple the open and closed channels with a radio frequency ( rf ) field when the two channels are tuned close to each other .",
    "this technique is used in many experiments , and it allows researchers to perform rabi oscillations between free atoms and molecules  @xcite . a beautiful illustration of this technique in nak feshbach molecule production",
    "is provided in fig .",
    "[ nakfbm ] , which is reproduced from reference  @xcite .          after producing weakly bound feshbach molecules , a two - photon - based coherent population transfer technique , named stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap )  @xcite ,",
    "is used to transfer molecules to the rovibratonal ground state .",
    "three states are involved in the process : the initial feshbach molecule state @xmath25 , an electronically excited state @xmath26 ( which is usually short - lived ) , and the rovibrational ground state @xmath27 .",
    "the excited state is chosen , after an exhaustive spectroscopy search , to optimize the franck - condon factors with both @xmath25 and @xmath27 .",
    "the states are coupled with two laser fields : the up leg , with rabi frequency @xmath28 , couples @xmath25 and @xmath26 ; and the down leg , with rabi frequency @xmath29 , couples @xmath27 and @xmath26 .",
    "although the franck - condon factors are reasonably large , the transition dipole moments are significantly smaller than typical cycling transitions in neutral atoms . during the adiabatic and coherent process of stirap , a field - dressed dark state , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , is strictly maintained .",
    "the laser intensities for the two beams are varied such that initially @xmath32 , and then the relationship adiabatically changes to @xmath33 .",
    "the laser intensities are ramped over a duration @xmath34 that is sufficiently long compared to the inverse of the rabi frequencies .",
    "since the population is trapped in the dark state , population transfer takes places from @xmath25 to @xmath27 without populating the lossy state @xmath26 .",
    "the typical stirap protocal for ultracold molecules is based on a dark resonance configuration , where both the one - photon and the two - photon detunings are zero .",
    "the excited state population is therefore adiabatically eliminated , as long as the following condition is satisfied : @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the relative laser linewidth of the two - photon transition  @xcite .",
    "thus , the two laser fields must be phase coherent with each other during the time @xmath34 . for typical pulse times",
    "@xmath37s , relative laser linewidths less than 1 khz are required , which can be achieved by stabilizing the lasers to an optical frequency comb  @xcite or a high - finesse optical cavity  @xcite .     to the absolute molecular ground state @xmath25 ( @xmath38=0 , @xmath39 of x@xmath40 ) .",
    "reproduced with permission from reference  @xcite.,width=288 ]    figure  [ krbstirap ] shows the transfer states used for efficient production of ground - state krb molecule .",
    "we note that the initial feshbach state is the least bound vibrational level of the @xmath41 ground potential , while the rovibrational ground state is in the @xmath40 ground potential .",
    "thus the intermediate electronic state must contain an admixture of singlet and triplet characters in order to allow reasonable transition strengths on both legs of the transfer .",
    "such an admixture results from significant spin - orbital coupling in the excited electronic state . using these states",
    ", we typically find a @xmath42 one - way transfer efficiency to and from the ground state .",
    "an important aspect to consider in such a stirap sequence is that the difference in energy between the initial and final states is @xmath43 k , which is enormous compared to the temperature of the gas ( @xmath44 nk ) .",
    "therefore , one might wonder whether any of this extra energy is deposited into the kinetic energy of molecules , which would heat the molecular gas out of the ultracold regime .",
    "however , since the transfer process is fully coherent , the energy difference between the states is carried away by the photons , and no kinetic energy ( beyond an effective photon recoil via the co - propagating laser beams ) is deposited into the molecular gas , which remains in the @xmath44 nk regime . when producing molecules directly in an optical lattice ( to be discussed later ) , this process allows the molecules to occupy the ground band of the lattice with very high probability  @xcite .",
    "this section focuses primarily on ultracold krb molecules , which is the only species for which detailed investigations of ultracold chemistry have been undertaken to date .",
    "immediately after ultracold polar krb molecules were produced in the rovibrational ground state , it became clear that chemical reactions were leading to loss of molecules confined in a conventional far - off - resonance optical dipole trap  @xcite .",
    "the stirap process transfers the molecules to the rovibrational ground state in the singlet ( @xmath45 ) electronic ground potential .",
    "although the electronic angular momentum is zero , there is still hyperfine structure arising from the nuclear magnetic moments of the constituent atoms .",
    "k has nuclear quantum number @xmath46 , while rb has nuclear quantum number @xmath47 , so there are 36 hyperfine states for each rotational state @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the principal rotational quantum number and @xmath50 is its projection onto the quantization axis .",
    "these states can be labelled as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the nuclear spin projection quantum number for k and rb , respectively . in the ultracold regime ,",
    "the initial feshbach association creates weakly bound molecules in a single quantum state since k and rb atoms approach each other in the lowest partial wave @xmath54 ( @xmath55=0 ) , where @xmath56 is the quantized relative angular momentum .",
    "thus , through a combination of the two - photon angular momentum selection rule and the spectral resolution provided by the coherent stirap process , the ground - state molecules will also occupy a single hyperfine quantum state , which in the case of krb is @xmath57 .",
    "this state is not the lowest in energy in the hyperfine manifold .",
    "the absolute ground state is actually @xmath58 . to reach this absolute ground state and",
    "to also provide a general spectroscopy tool to coherently and efficiently transfer populations between different hyperfine states , we have developed another coherent two - photon transfer technique , which is based on the use of two microwave photons to couple from two different hyperfine states in @xmath59 to a common hyperfine state in the @xmath60 manifold via electric dipole transitions .",
    "this two - photon coupling is enabled by the fact that the @xmath60 state has non - negligible ( a few percent ) spin mixing due to coupling between rotation and the nuclear electric quadrupole moment  @xcite .",
    "this microwave - based raman transition allows us to transfer the molecular population to any hyperfine state in @xmath59 , including the absolute ground state @xmath58 .",
    "this technique is also important for the creation of a 50:50 mixture of two hyperfine states in the ground state or a 50:50 mixture of two rotational states for krb molecules , which we use to study the role of quantum statistics of identical molecules in the reaction process .",
    "owing to the antisymmetrization requirement of the overall wavefunction for two identical fermions , spin - polarized ( i.e. , the same internal state ) @xmath61k@xmath62rb molecules collide via odd partial waves . at ultralow temperatures ,",
    "the lowest odd partial wave is the @xmath63-wave ( @xmath55=1 ) .",
    "in contrast , distinguishable molecules ( such as a hyperfine or a rotational mixture ) can collide via @xmath54-wave ( @xmath55=0 ) .",
    "thus , when molecules are brought to the quantum regime , their interactions and reactions will be governed by the molecular quantum statistics , single partial - wave scattering , and quantum threshold laws at a vanishing collision energy .",
    "the first set of experiments that explored this interesting new regime for molecular reactions is reported in reference  @xcite , which studied the dependence of reaction rate on temperature and quantum statistics without applying a laboratory electric field .    as a result of the chemical reactions , the number density @xmath64 of trapped molecules decreases according to @xmath65 where @xmath36 is the two - body loss coefficient and @xmath66 describes a decrease in density arising from an increase in temperature .",
    "the temperature increase results from loss from the highest density part of the sample , where the particles have the lowest potential energy in a harmonic trap  @xcite .",
    "the remaining one - body loss mechanism has a much longer time constant .",
    "the two - body loss rate @xmath36 is found to be proportional to @xmath67 for spin - polarized samples , which is the expected dependence from the bethe - wigner threshold laws for @xmath63-wave collisions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tempdep ] ) .",
    "the lack of any oscillatory signatures in the rate coefficient dependence on temperature is consistent with a simple model that assumes that after the molecules tunnel through the @xmath63-wave barrier they chemically react with a near unity probability  @xcite .",
    "-wave threshold behavior . for comparison ,",
    "loss rate for a 50:50 mixture of hyperfine spin states is shown , where the nature of @xmath54-wave collisions removes the temperature dependence for the rate constant while the loss magnitude is increased by a factor of 10 - 100 .",
    "reproduced with permission from reference  @xcite.,width=340 ]     and @xmath68 , in a harmonic trap .",
    "the extracted loss rate is @xmath69 @xmath70 s@xmath71 , which is almost 5 times higher than for the ground - state hyperfine mixture .",
    "reproduced with permission from reference  @xcite.,width=302 ]    for an incoherent 50:50 mixture of two hyperfine states in the ground state ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) , @xmath54-wave collisions start to play a dominant role since the molecules from the two different states are distinguishable . as a result ,",
    "the loss rate shows no measurable temperature dependence and its magnitude is increased by ten- to hundredfold in comparison to the @xmath63-wave rate .",
    "the measured rate agrees very well with the predicted universal loss rate related to the two - body van der waals length .",
    "we note that the absolute ground state ( @xmath58 ) demonstrates the same loss rate as other higher lying hyperfine states .",
    "molecules prepared in an incoherent 50:50 mixture of rotational states ( half in @xmath57 and half in @xmath68 ) have the largest loss rate observed at zero electric field . a typical loss curve can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mixtureloss ] , from which a decay coefficient of @xmath72 @xmath70 s@xmath71 is extracted .",
    "this is almost 5 times higher than for the @xmath73 mixture @xcite .",
    "finally , when both atoms and molecules are prepared in their lowest - energy states , we have also observed a universal @xmath54-wave loss rate from the exothermic atom - exchange reaction for k + krb @xmath74 k@xmath1 + rb . for an endothermic process of rb + krb @xmath74 rb@xmath1 + k , which is forbidden , the observed loss rate approaches zero within the measurement uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "however , if the rb density becomes too high , a three - body loss process involving two rb atoms and a krb will limit the molecular lifetime .",
    "when an electric field is applied , the molecules develop an electric dipole moment in the laboratory frame and this modifies how the molecules interact with each other .",
    "first , the isotropic centrifugal barrier arising from the @xmath63-wave becomes anisotropic . for @xmath75 , the projection onto the electric field - defined quantization axis , @xmath76 ,",
    "dictates how the molecules collide : @xmath77 corresponds to a  head - to - tail \" collision , which is attractive under the dipole - dipole interaction ; while @xmath78 corresponds to a  side - by - side \" collision , which is repulsive under the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "this is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pwave ] .",
    "furthermore , the dipole - dipole interaction also mixes states with different partial waves , such that one should replace @xmath55 = 1 with the lowest centrifugal barrier associated with the odd-@xmath55 adiabatic channel .",
    "similarly , @xmath55 = 0 becomes the lowest - energy adiabatic channel with even @xmath55 , which does not have a centrifugal barrier .",
    "-wave barrier at zero electric field is isotropic and does not depend on the orientation in which the molecules collide .",
    "( b ) in an applied dc electric field , dipolar interactions reduce the centrifugal barrier for  head - to - tail \" collisions ( blue arrow ) and increase the centrifugal barrier for  side - by - side \" collisions . reproduced with permission from reference  @xcite.,width=264 ]        in a regular far - off - resonance optical dipole trap , we do not have control over the projection of the relative angular momentum of the colliding particles on the quantization axis . therefore , while for @xmath78 the centrifugal barrier is significantly increased with a reasonable electric field , the observed loss rate will be dominated by the @xmath77 collision channel , which has a much lowered barrier height for reactions ( fig .  [",
    "fig : pwave ] ) .",
    "consequently , the measured loss rate increases sharply as a function of the electric field , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipdep ] .",
    "in fact , @xmath79 ( @xmath0 is the induced dipole moment in the laboratory frame ) , which agrees well with a quantum threshold model that takes into account the long - range dipolar interaction  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the rate constant on electric field shows a smooth behavior , further indicating a near - unity reaction probability in the short range .",
    "chemical reactions for ultralow temperature polar molecules confined in a three - dimensional harmonic trap thus depend strongly on the quantum statistics of the molecular gas , individual collision partial waves and temperature , and the induced dipole moment in the lab frame . in the remainder of this chapter",
    "we will present results on the control of the reaction rate when we modify the dimensionality of the optical traps in which the molecules are confined .      since an electric dipole moment exists only between quantum states that have opposite parity , individual rotational states @xmath48 have no dipole moment in the lab frame at zero electric field . when a dc electric field is applied , opposite - parity rotational states become mixed , giving rise to a nonzero dipole moment in the lab frame . in other words ,",
    "molecules become aligned with the applied field .",
    "the hamiltonian for the rotational states @xmath48 under an electric field ( @xmath80 ) has two contributions arising from the diagonal rotational energy and the state - mixing ( off - diagonal ) stark effect : @xmath81 here @xmath5 is the rotational constant for the vibrational ground state , and the term @xmath82 describes the dipole - field coupling operator . if the electric field , of magnitude @xmath83 , is along the @xmath84 axis , the matrix elements of eq .",

    "[ fig : dipolemoments ] .",
    "a field strength of more than 40 kv / cm in the lab is required to reach 80% of the full dipole moment .",

    "blue ) , @xmath95 ( orange ) , and @xmath96 states ( green ) , calculated using the lowest 20 rotational levels in eq .",
    "[ eqn : rrham].,width=377 ]    since successive rotational states have opposite parity , a more efficient option for realizing a lab - frame dipole moment is to use resonant rf or microwave field to directly couple two neighboring rotational states . when the @xmath73 and @xmath93 states are coherently mixed , we realize a dipole moment of the magnitude of @xmath97 even after the applied field has been removed .",
    "this is the technique used in references  @xcite to realize dipolar - interaction - mediated spin exchanges in a three - dimensional optical lattice .      to suppress the large reaction rate of krb molecules in an electric field ,",
    "we must remove the lossy head - to - tail collisions .",
    "hence , we need to gain control over the projection of the relative angular momentum of the colliding molecules on the quantization @xmath84 axis , @xmath76 . this can be achieved by confining molecules in a two - dimensional optical trap , which can be realized by interfering two counterpropagating optical beams to create a 1d lattice that consists of a stack of 2d lattice sites .",
    "the dc electric field is applied perpendicular to the 2d traps . in such a configuration ,",
    "the lossy  head - to - tail \" collisions with @xmath98 are greatly suppressed , and the repulsive  side - by - side \" collisions with @xmath99 stabilizes the molecular gas  @xcite .",

    "for example , if two krb molecules are prepared in the same internal state ( spin - polarized ) and have the same @xmath100 , then they must collide with an odd @xmath103 , which will give rise to a repulsive dipole - dipole interaction that suppresses the chemical reaction .",
    "if , on the other hand , the two molecules are prepared in different states of @xmath100 , then the even @xmath103 channel will be left open , and the reaction will thus proceed strongly . in the limit of a very large applied electric field and a very strong optical confinement along @xmath84 , we will approach the classical limit where repulsive dipole - dipole interactions dominate for both bose and fermi quantum statistics  @xcite .",
    "this is the regime where the characteristic length scale associated with the dipole - dipole interaction exceeds the harmonic oscillator length in @xmath84 .",

    "as expected , @xmath104 is the smallest for channel 3 .",
    "the suppression of the reaction rate via odd @xmath103 , in comparison to the head - to - tail collisions , is about a factor of 60 at an induced dipole moment of 0.174 d ( fig .",

    "this two - dimensional trap configuration can be ubiquitously applied to dipolar systems to control collision processes by fine tuning the collision angle relative to the dipole angle .",
    "similar experiments have recently been performed with feshbach molecules of highly magnetic erbium atoms confined in a 1d lattice with similar goals of removing the attractive part of the dipole - dipole interaction  @xcite .",
    "new experiments at mit with nak molecules are also moving in the direction of a 1d lattice to use strong repulsion to stabilize the system against inelastic collisions  @xcite .      the previous discussion of molecular collisions and reactions focused on two - body inelastic collisions .",
    "this is strongly supported by the observation that inelastic loss rates are @xmath105100 times larger with non - identical fermions than with spin - polarized fermions . to reiterate , in the spin polarized case the molecules have to collide in the @xmath63-wave channel , whereas with a spin mixture the @xmath54-wave channel becomes available and so the molecules do not have to tunnel through the energy barrier of the @xmath63-wave channel .",
    "given that the krb + krb reaction is exothermic , there is a strong interest in the scientific community in working with bialkali species that are predicted to have endothermic reactions with suppressed loss rates  @xcite .",
    "however , molecular scattering experts such as john bohn at jila have also predicted substantial loss in three - body collision channels  @xcite .",
    "the simple intuitive picture they invoke for these processes is the following : two molecules can collide and temporarily form a reaction complex prior to separating . during the period in which they are very near each other , a third molecule can come in and force the complex to a deeper bound molecular state that results in inelastic loss of all three molecules .",
    "these processes could be responsible for observed losses that are difficult to attribute to two - body loss mechanisms , but rigorous experimental confirmation of these lossy three - body processes is challenging .",
    "let us consider the case of three - body collisions of fermions .",
    "if the fermions are spin polarized , three - body collisions will require the @xmath63-wave channel in the same way as two - body collisions .",

    "the system of ultracold polar fermionic molecules offers the additional complexity that @xmath54-wave collisions are not allowed , and @xmath63-wave collisions are suppressed at ultralow temperatures due to the centrifugal barrier .",
    "this makes efficient thermalization really challenging even if the molecules are not reactive .",
    "however , as was discussed in sec.(2.4 ) , polar molecules can be confined in a 2d spatial geometry with an external electric field applied perpendicular to the 2d plane to significantly suppress undesired lossy collisions . at the same time , electric - field induced dipole - dipole interactions mix even and odd collision partial waves .",

    "this is referred to as universal dipolar scattering , and it has been realized in ultracold atom experiments with the highly magnetic lanthanide atoms that interact with magnetic dipoles .",
    "such scattering has lead to the direct cooling of spin - polarized degenerate fermi gases of dy  @xcite and er  @xcite , without the need of having other species to sympathetically cool the fermions at ultralow temperatures .",
    "the technology of working with ultracold atoms in optical lattices has matured greatly over the past decade , with the precise control of atomic interactions and various configurations of the lattice geometry and tunneling energy .",
    "these capabilities have become very useful when lattice - based cold atom systems are being developed to realize novel hamiltonians that are interesting of their own merit or useful to simulate some outstanding problems in condensed matter phenomena  @xcite .",
    "the dipole - dipole interactions present in ultracold polar molecules offer exciting extensions to these models in which long - range interactions play a central role  @xcite .",
    "already , an extended bose - hubbard model , where dipole - dipole interactions modify the phase diagram , has been studied using magnetic atoms  @xcite .",
    "an exciting new technology with ultracold atoms in optical lattices is the development of high resolution spatial detection of the atoms in the lattice  @xcite , where several groups are now able to resolve and image atoms located on individual lattice sites  @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ microscope ] .",
    "such techniques are referred to as quantum gas microscopy .",
    "it will be tremendously powerful if we can extend the quantum gas microscope tool to ultracold polar molecules so that we have single - site imaging resolution for molecules in an optical lattice . in this particular area ,",
    "coherent association of cold atoms to form ultracold molecules offers an enormous advantage over direct cooling of molecules .",
    "imaging of ultracold polar molecules can be easily accomplished by dissociating the molecules into their constituent atoms , which can be efficiently detected by scattering thousands of photons .",
    "therefore , a quantum gas microscope for polar molecules would be operated the same way as for atoms , except that the molecules are dissociated prior to imaging .",
    "high resolution imaging of polar molecules in an optical lattice will pave the way for investigations of non - equilibrium many - body dynamics , such as spin diffusion and many - body localization , where individual excitations can be tracked as they propagate throughout the system .",
    "moreover , this technique can be extended to address localized regions of the lattice to create an array of out - of - equilibrium molecules with excitations  @xcite .      for most polar molecules , an electric field of several kv / cm",
    "is required to induce a significant dipole moment .",
    "references  @xcite have a table of all the bialkali combinations which shows that most species are not fully polarized until 5 kv / cm , and some ( like krb ) are not fully polarized until @xmath197 kv / cm ( see fig .  [ dipolemoments ] ) .",
    "one simple reason for this requirement of a large field is the lack of parity - doublets in the singlet ground - state potential for bialkalis , where only the opposite parity rotational states can be used for molecular polarization .",
    "the energy spacing for neighboring rotational states is typically a few ghz .",
    "therefore , the design of electrodes for ultracold polar molecules experiments must be done carefully with the specific molecule of choice in mind .",
    "once polarized , polar molecules become very sensitive to inhomogeneities and instabilities of the electric field .",
    "this sensitivity can be a challenge for experiments , and the control of the field , in both the spatial and time domains , becomes exceedingly important if precise manipulations of molecules using electric field are a desired feature .",
    "much of our early work with ultracold polar molecules in electric fields was done with electrodes located outside the vacuum chamber .",
    "indeed , we had to deal with extensive complications due to transient electric fields , which were attributed to charge build - up and polarization of the vacuum glass cell .",
    "an obvious solution is to set up high voltage electrodes inside the vacuum system , and indeed a number of research groups have started along this path ( there are few publications at the time of this writing , but see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "typical configurations are composed of metal rods and/or glass plates coated with a conductive thin film like indium tin oxide ( ito ) .",
    "such semiconductor thin films are known to be damaged by alkali vapor  @xcite , and so care must be taken to limit the alkali flux onto the coating to a sufficiently low level . alternatively , metal thin films like nickel work well with alkalis , but the optical transmission is significantly lower for the same thickness .",
    "metal plates would be more convenient , but they prohibitively limit the available optical access .",
    "metal rods are typically arranged in a quadrupole fashion , which is a versatile configuration for the application of fields with gradients or somewhat homogeneous fields .",
    "naturally , the field from rods alone will not be perfectly homogeneous in the space surrounded by the rods , and one must ensure that the field inhomogeneity experienced by the entire molecular cloud does not present a problem for the experiment of interest . since some of our next experimental goals are to investigate the full spin-1/2 hamiltonian that incorporates both the ising and spin - exchange interactions  @xcite , we must ensure that the site - to - site stark shift for molecules in the optical lattice is significantly smaller than the molecule interaction energy .",
    "we have therefore decided to pursue a combination of ito - coated plates and four metal rods in a configuration that will allow a homogeneous field to be present in the central region while still being able to accommodate the application of electric field gradients when necessary .",
    "the electric field gradient can be used to spectroscopically select particular lattice sites for example , or be used to tilt the 2d optical trap to enable efficient evaporation of molecules .",
    "so far , chemical reactions in the quantum regime have been probed only through the loss measurement of the reactants and the dependences on certain quantum properties for the entrance channel  @xcite ; the final products of such reactions have not been directly observed .",
    "quantum chemists are very interested in such investigations since they would shed light on the specifics of the energy and momentum transfer between the reactants and products in a fully quantized system  @xcite .",
    "detection of the products in this type of quantum gas experiments is very challenging for many reasons .",
    "first , the products typically have significantly more kinetic energy than the depth of the trap that is used to confine the reactant molecules , and so the product molecules are lost too quickly to detect .",
    "second , the product molecules can not be probed by scattering many photons as in a typical atomic absorption or fluorescence imaging .",
    "third , the goal is to identify the specific quantum state distributions of the products , and therefore any detection technique must be state specific .",
    "the best way to address such requirements and limitations is to state - selectively photo - ionize the product molecules , which can then be detected with ion detectors inside the vacuum chamber . no experiments with ultracold polar molecules have ion detectors to date , and so such experiments must specifically be designed with these goals .",
    "efforts are underway in the group of kang - kuen ni at harvard university to detect the quantum states of the products from reactions of ultracold krb molecules .",
    "many research groups are now pursuing ultracold molecules composed of more exotic atoms , including alkaline earth and rare earths .",
    "combinations of alkalis with alkaline earths produce diatomic radicals , which have an unpaired electron .",
    "thus , such heteronuclear molecular species have both an electric dipole moment and a magnetic dipole moment , and offer researchers even more possibilities for control  @xcite .",
    "notable examples of recent work with ultracold mixtures include efforts towards rbsr  @xcite , dyk , dyer ( both underway at the university of innsbruck ) , and liyb  @xcite molecules .",
    "most experiments designed to cool and trap molecules either with a stark decelerator or a magneto - optical trap use molecules with a single unpaired electron , such that the interactions with light fields nearly mirror that of alkali atoms  @xcite",
    ". examples of such molecules include srf  @xcite , oh  @xcite , yo  @xcite , ybf  @xcite , tho  @xcite , caf  @xcite and many others .",
