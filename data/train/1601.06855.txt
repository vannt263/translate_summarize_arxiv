    ", this simulation problem has many variants and the case when a and b share unlimited amount of entanglement has been completely solved @xcite . to optimally simulate @xmath1 in the asymptotic setting ,",
    "the rate is determined by the entanglement - assisted classical capacity of @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this rate can not be improved even with no - signalling correlations or feedback @xcite .    in the zero - error setting @xcite ,",
    "recently the quantum zero - error information theory has been studied and the problem becomes more complex since many unexpected phenomena were observed such as the super - activation of noisy channels @xcite as well as the assistance of shared entanglement in zero - error communication @xcite .",
    "quantum no - signalling correlations ( qnsc ) are introduced as two - input and two - output quantum channels with the no - signalling constraints . and",
    "such correlations have been studied in the relativistic causality of quantum operations @xcite .",
    "cubitt et al .",
    "@xcite first introduced classical no - signalling correlations into the zero - error classical communication problem .",
    "they also observed a kind of reversibility between no - signalling assisted zero - error capacity and exact simulation @xcite .",
    "duan and winter @xcite further introduced quantum non - signalling correlations into the zero - error communication problem and formulated both capacity and simulation cost problems as semidefinite programmings ( sdps ) @xcite which depend only on the non - commutative bipartite graph @xmath2 . to be specific",

    "width=192 ]    the simulation cost problem concerns how much zero - error communication is required to simulate a noisy channel exactly . particularly , the _ one - shot _ zero - error classical simulation cost of @xmath0 assisted by @xmath6 is the least noiseless symbols @xmath13 from @xmath14 to @xmath15 so that @xmath1 can simulate @xmath0 . in @xcite ,",

    "the so - called `` non - commutative graph theory '' was first suggested in @xcite as the non - commutative graph associated with the channel captures the zero - error communication properties , thus playing a similar role to confusability graph .",

    "such choi - kraus operator space @xmath2 is alternatively called `` non - commutative bipartite graph '' since it is clear that any classical channel induces a bipartite graph and a confusability graph , while a quantum channel induces a non - commutative bipartite graph together with a non - commutative graph @xcite .    back to the simulation cost problem ,",
    "since there might be more than one channel with choi - kraus operator space included in @xmath2 , the exact simulation cost of the `` cheapest '' one among these channels was defined as the one - shot zero - error classical simulation cost of @xmath2 @xcite : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 means that @xmath26 is a subspace of @xmath2 .",
