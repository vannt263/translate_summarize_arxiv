    "the interplay between superconductivity ( sc ) and insulating charge or spin density wave states is a subject of an active investigation for more than 30 years ( for a review see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the density wave ( dw ) is traditionally considered as a strong obstacle for the formation of sc , because it creates an energy gap on the fermi level.levin,balseiro,milans the coexistence of dw and sc has been considered in metals with several conducting bands or with imperfect nesting , when even in the dw state there is a finite electron density on the fermi level.bilbro,machida,psaltakis then the transition temperature @xmath5 to the sc state reduces exponentially when the dw is formed , because the electrons , participating in the formation of dw , drop out from the sc condensate.@xcite    however , in several compounds [ e.g. , in layered organic superconductors ( tmtsf)@xmath1pf@xmath2 and @xmath3-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1khg(scn)@xmath4],vuletic , cdwsc the sc transition temperature on the dw background is very close to ( or even exceeds ) @xmath5 without dw . in ( tmtsf)@xmath1pf@xmath2 superconductivity coexists with spin - density - wave ( sdw ) state at temperature below @xmath7 in the pressure interval above some critical pressure @xmath8kbar , but below @xmath9kbar , at which the sdw phase undergoes the 1st order phase transition into metallic state.@xcite",
    "this fact is even more surprising , because this compound has only one quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) conducting band .",
    "a special attention was given to the fact , that the upper critical field @xmath0 in this superconducting state exceeds several times the expected paramagnetic limit,@xcite ( see refs .",
    "[ ] ) , and no change in the knight shift has been observed in this compound as temperature lowers to this sc state@xcite .",
    "both these features suggest the spin - triplet superconducting paring in ( tmtsf)@xmath1pf@xmath2 .",
    "in addition , the upper critical field @xmath0 perpendicular to the conducting layers strongly increases as pressure approaches @xmath10 and has an unusual upward curvature as function of temperature@xcite , suggesting that the sdw has a very strong influence on the sc properties of this phase .",
    "the electronic structure of this mixed phase is still under debates .",
    "a phase separation in a form of macroscopic metal and dw domains,@xcite being natural with the constant volume constraint , seems strange at fixed pressure , when the whole sample may choose the state with the lowest free energy .",
    "the pressure and temperature dependence of the upper critical field requires,@xcite that the size @xmath11 of the sc domains , if they exist , must be much less than the sc coherence length @xmath12 as pressure approaches @xmath10 [ see eq .",
    "( [ hslab ] ) and the discussion in sec .",
    "this raises many questions about the structure of such a mixed state , because if the domain width is comparable to the sdw coherence length , this confinement of the electron wave functions costs additional energy greater than the sc energy gap .",
    "the angular magnetoresistance oscillations@xcite do not give a definite test whether the spatial phase separation occurs on a scale greater than the sc coherence length .",
    "an alternative to the picture @xcite of macroscopic dw and normal ( or sc ) domains in ( tmtsf)@xmath1pf@xmath2 has been proposed recently.@xcite according to ref .",
    "@xcite , there are two different structures where sc coexists microscopically with dw . in the first structure , the destruction of the insulating dw phase at @xmath13 goes via forming the ungapped metallic pockets in the electronic spectrum , that spread over the momentum space , merging into the normal metallic state gradually or via a phase transition .",
    "this scenario , looking similar to the one studied in refs .",
    "[ ] , however , differs from it , because the formation of dw strongly modifies the quasi - particle dispersion in the ungapped parts of the fermi surface , changing the properties of sc state on the dw background . in the second scenario ,",
    "the dw order parameter at pressure @xmath13 becomes spatially nonuniform by means of amplitude solitons .",
    "these soliton structures are familiar in charge - density - wave ( cdw ) states at high pressure or in magnetic field ( see , e.g. , reviews in refs .",
    "[ ] , [ ] ) .",
    "the normal or sc phase appears first as the metallic domain walls , and the concentration of these soliton walls increases with increasing pressure . at finite density of solitons , i.e. above @xmath14",
    "the electron wave functions of single solitons strongly overlap , forming a new periodic conducting metallic network on the dw background .",
    "if it were not for the 1st order transition with the further increase of soliton density , the new phase is expected to merge gradually into the normal state .",
    "both microscopic structures may appear in dw superconductors .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments@xcite are consistent with the scenario , where the phase separation takes place on the microscopic scale not exceeding the dw coherence length , thus supporting either of the above scenarios . in both scenarios , at low enough temperature , superconductivity appears at pressure @xmath13,@xcite and the dw have a strong influence on the properties of such a mixed sc state . in particular",
    ", the sdw background suppresses the spin - singlet sc pairing , making spin - triplet pairing to be expected@xcite in agreement with experiments in ( tmtsf)@xmath1pf@xmath2.@xcite this feature appears due to the spin - dependent scattering on the sdw condensate , and it does not happen when superconductivity coexists with cdw .",
    "in the present paper we follow the ideas of ref . [ ] and study in detail the microscopic structure and properties of the mixed sc - dw state in the first scenario of uniform dw with ungapped metallic pockets above @xmath13 . in sec .",
    "ii we generalize the model of ref .",
    "[ ] to the case of more realistic e - e interaction with backward and forward scattering , and describe in detail the uniform dw state with ungapped pockets . in sec .",
    "iii we estimate the sc transition temperature and the upper critical field @xmath0 in the dw - sc mixed state , and show , that @xmath0 strongly increases as pressure approaches the critical value @xmath10 , in agreement with experiments in ( tmtsf)@xmath1pf@xmath2 and @xmath3-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1khg(scn)@xmath4 . in sec .",

    "the dispersion along the @xmath21-axis is considerably weaker than along the @xmath20-direction and does not play any role in the analysis below .",

    "the charge or spin density wave is formed .    for superconducting pairing , both the momentum and frequency dependence of the potential ( [ vq ] ) is important , being different for different compounds .",
    "below we consider only a simplified model , similar to the bcs model,@xcite where the frequency dependence of the interaction potential is taken into account only through the ultraviolet cutoff ( debye frequency ) in the cooper loop .",
