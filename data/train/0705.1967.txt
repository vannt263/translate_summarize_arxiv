    "in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , phase transitions have been identified and studied for some time now .",

    "all absorbing state phase transitions with a scalar order parameter and no additional conservation laws are characterized by dp critical exponents .",
    "one of the questions that has not been answered conclusively is how the introduction of quenched disorder affects the universal critical behavior of the dp class .",
    "according to the harris criterion  @xcite , the critical exponents should change even for weak disorder .",
    "this has been investigated in particular for the contact process ( cp )  @xcite which is one of the archetypical models of the dp universality class .",
    "currently , there are two alternative scenarios how the exponents change with introduction of disorder : according to results in refs .",

    "time - dependent perturbation theory as introduced by dickman and jensen  @xcite for homogeneous @xmath1 systems gives the most accurate numerical values .",
    "technically , this has been done by using one - variable pad approximants in the analysis of the series for the survival probability . in this paper",
    ", we extend their approach to heterogeneous and disordered @xmath1 lattices and introduce the use of a pad approximants similar to the nested pad approximants ( npa s ) @xcite in order to deal with two control parameters ( two recovery rates ) , characteristic of binary lattices .",

    "the aim of the paper is two - fold : first , we present and discuss the technical details of the supercritical series expansions in the case of two variables , i.e.  of two different recovery rates characteristic of nodes of two different types , which are different from the well - studied one - parameter case  @xcite .",
    "second , we investigate the range of applicability and the effects of variations of our procedure based on npa s on the estimates of critical values and exponents and compare these results to those obtained by employing pda s .    the structure of the paper is as follows : we introduce the cp in sec .",

    "the cp , originally introduced by harris  @xcite , is a spatial sis ( susceptible - infected - susceptible)-model for the spread of epidemics through a network . in a network , usually taken to be a hyper - cubic lattice ,",
    "the nodes or sites can be in one of two states : `` infected '' or `` susceptible '' .",
    "a susceptible / vacant site @xmath2 can be infected by a neighboring infected / occupied site @xmath3 , while an occupied site @xmath4 can spontaneously recover and become susceptible again .",
    "these processes occur with rates @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , where @xmath7 is the number of nearest neighbors in the lattice .    in all dimensions ,",

    "this occurs when the recovery rates become smaller than a set of critical values . at this point ,",
    "the survival probability , that is the probability that process will not enter the absorbing state ( in the thermodynamic limit ) , becomes greater than zero .",
    "several observables can be identified that describe the critical state of the cp , such as the average density of infected sites , @xmath8 , or the survival probability up to time @xmath9 after starting from a single seed , @xmath10 . as @xmath11 , in a homogeneous system ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , close to the critical point these quantities",
    "are expected to behave like @xcite @xmath14 here @xmath0 is the critical exponent associated with stationary behavior of the order parameter and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the critical point for the control parameter recovery rate @xmath17 .",
    "each site @xmath2 of the system of @xmath18 nodes obeying the rules of the cp can be in two states : @xmath19 where @xmath20 or @xmath21 so that a microstate of the system with @xmath18 sites can be written as @xmath22 this representation ensures that the microstate vectors form a @xmath23-dimensional orthonormal basis .",
    "the state of the system at time @xmath9 is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the probability that the system is found in microstate @xmath26 .",
    "the time - evolution of the state of the system is governed by the master equation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the liouville operator whose non - zero off - diagonal elements in this basis are the transition rates between microstates that for the cp differ in their occupation number by one .",
    "this operator describes the probability flow between different microstates and is thus represented by a stochastic matrix in which all the diagonal elements are the sums of the off - diagonal elements in the corresponding columns taken with the opposite sign .    in a formalism introduced by doi  @xcite and peliti  @xcite for stochastic systems ,",
    "`` annihilation '' and `` creation '' operators on site @xmath2 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , are defined , such that @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( e.g.  @xmath33 ) and that they obey hard - core bosonic commutation relations .    for simplicity ,",

    "we employ a scheme similar to the npa s",
    "@xcite in which we in turn form one - variable pad approximants with respect to the two variables .",
    "to this end , we transform the variables @xmath78 to the following three more convenient sets , t1 , t2 and t3 .",

    "it turns out that occasionally the first positive real roots are unphysical ones that appear before the physical solution .",
    "however , these roots are very closely matched by roots of the numerator of the pad approximant of @xmath111 , so that these two cancel each other , leaving the physical root as the solution . in order to extract unphysical roots",
    "a further parameter @xmath112 has been introduced .",

    "all results presented below are obtained by setting @xmath119 .    in order to evaluate the stability of a certain pole ,",
    "several approximants are formed with respect to @xmath85 close to the diagonal approximant , e.g.  for even @xmath120 , we compute @xmath121 , [ k-1,k ] , [ k , k-1 ] , \\ldots [ k-2 , k-2]$ ] and take the average over these poles . once we obtained the critical value , the critical exponent @xmath0 associated with the order parameter @xmath67",
    "can be found as well , as it is just the residue at the pole @xmath122 .",
    "again , the average over the residues for different pad approximants is taken . as the error that we could extract from employing this method is small and",
    "does not take into account the inherent error in the series expansion , we perform this averaging to minimize the effects due to a particular choice of approximant and use the standard deviation only to evaluate the numerical stability of a pole .      another method for estimating critical values given a finite two - variable series are the pda s originally developed by fisher  @xcite in order to investigate multicritical points .",
    "the starting point of this method is that one is given a finite two - variable polynomial , @xmath123 , that approximates a true function @xmath124 , that is expected to have the following form , @xmath125 where @xmath126 is some general function with @xmath127 .",
    "the set @xmath128 is a so - called label set that contains the pairs of powers @xmath129 of @xmath101 and @xmath130 only if @xmath131 , i.e.   @xmath132 if @xmath133 has a non - zero term of order @xmath134 . for fixed label sets @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 , it is possible to find polynomials @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 such that they satisfy the _ defining _ equation @xmath141 with @xmath142 denoting a sum of non - zero terms whose powers are not in the _ matching set _ @xmath143 .",

    "once the polynomials @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 are found , e.g. by using an algorithm proposed by styer  @xcite , they can be used to find an estimate for the line of critical points by the method of characteristics ( e.g. see  @xcite ) . according to this method ,",

    "the exact configurational averaging discussed above , exploiting symmetry about the origin and under the exchange of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , is not possible for such high orders due to computational cost when dealing with a very large number ( of @xmath183 ) of configurations .",
