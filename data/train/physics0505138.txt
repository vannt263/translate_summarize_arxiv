    "this work , some of whose aspects were promulgated in @xcite , addresses onset of double - component , buoyancy - driven convection resulting from the boundary conditions for one component being different from those for the other .",
    "such convection has recently been identified as a fundamentally new class of hydrodynamic instabilities underlying the formation of spatial and temporal flow patterns from a steady equilibrium state of spatially homogeneous fluid .",
    "the main emphasis of this study is on developing a universally consistent perspective for understanding the effects of different orientation of the fluid domain to the gravity .",
    "double - component convection is relevant to the phenomena in small - scale oceanography @xcite , geology @xcite , geodynamo @xcite , and such areas of astrophysics as ordinary evolution of stars @xcite and core - collapse supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "it has technological applications as well , in particular to crystal growth @xcite .",
    "double - component convection has also been suggested as a possible cause of layering phenomena in colloidal suspensions @xcite and as the origin of pattern formation in soap films @xcite .",
    "early reviews of some of the above applications of the effects of different component diffusivities in double - component convection can be found in @xcite .",
    "in addition , convective flows are commonly used in fundamental studies of transition to turbulence and nonlinear pattern formation @xcite .",
    "double - component flows where a distinction between the components comes from component different boundary conditions are also of basic significance in the context of their applications to large - scale environmental and turbulent processes",
    ". in particular , such processes are circulations @xcite and the global ocean thermohaline circulation @xcite . except for limited aspects of the latter context ,",
    "however , two - component convection in pure fluid has been previously addressed mostly in the framework of only the effects of different diffusion coefficients @xcite .",
    "was the first to highlight the onset of oscillatory convection resulting from an unequal effect of different boundary conditions on the component diffusion gradients in perturbed state .",
    "such convection was demonstrated in @xcite to arise in a horizontal layer of inviscid fluid with a double - component , statically stable net stratification .",
    "the instability mechanism described in @xcite has later been recognized by the present author @xcite as being conceptually analogous to that driving oscillatory convection in the diffusive regime of the classical double - diffusion @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested in @xcite that such analogy between the effect of different boundary conditions and that of unequal diffusivities is of a generic nature . near a boundary",
    "towards which across - slot perturbation motion is directed , the component with its boundary value fixed would have a higher perturbation gradient than the component whose boundary condition is specified in terms of the flux .",
    "the different rates of gradient diffusion resulting from such a disparity could thus trigger double - component convection analogously to the effect of unequal component diffusivities in conventional double - diffusive convection .",
    "in terms of the analogy just described , the mechanism of steady convection under the stratification inverse to that in @xcite has been shown in @xcite to be conceptually reminiscent of the finger instability in the classical double - diffusion @xcite .",
    "( the mathematical problem discussed in @xcite also happens to describe double - component circulations @xcite . ) in application to two horizontal gradients , the effect of different boundary conditions was also demonstrated in @xcite to apply to a laterally heated stably stratified slot ( lhsss ) .",
    "the latter configuration had been studied before only in the context of the classical double - diffusion @xcite .",
    "the above effect of boundary conditions was also demonstrated in @xcite to result in steady convection when two compensating horizontal gradients maintained by different boundary conditions are applied to a vertical layer of boussinesq fluid at rest . in the latter configuration , however , finite - amplitude convective steady flows arise without the respective linear instability of the conduction state , as in the scenario first proposed in @xcite .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the analogous problem of the classical double - diffusion @xcite , where the respective linear instability is concomitant of subcritical steady convection .",
    "the finite - amplitude manifestation of convection uncovered in @xcite was also found to take place under a stable vertical solute stratification .",
    "in addition , the scenario in @xcite unveiled the existence of an oscillatory linear instability .",
    "it thus suggested the possibility of a new oscillatory manifestation of convection due to different boundary conditions .",
    "differential diffusion due to unequal perturbation gradients of the components ( differential gradient diffusion @xcite ) is not the only process by means of which different boundary conditions can trigger convection from the state of rest . as reported in @xcite , finite - amplitude steady convection",
    "could arise well before the onset of the respective linear instability in the viscous version of the problem considered in @xcite .",
    "in this case , the disparity between component stratifications resulting from finite - amplitude perturbation generates convective flows due to the feedback coming from nonlinear  convection .",
    "such finite - amplitude convection was found in @xcite to coexist with an oscillatory linear instability in viscous fluid .",
    "the main objective of the present study is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the manifestation of infinite - slot convection resulting from different boundary conditions for diverse slot orientations to the gravity .",
    "the central issue in achieving this objective is oscillatory small - amplitude manifestation of such convection . resulting from this work , the understanding of this issue has required uncovery and analysis of inviscid and viscous transformations of the oscillatory instability into respective steady one . in addition , it required identification of a new physical mechanism of oscillatory instability .",
    "such instability arises in the vertical slot with viscous fluid @xcite .",
    "the key physical effects underlying transformation between the inviscid mechanism of horizontal - slot oscillatory instability in @xcite and the new vertical - slot mechanism in viscous fluid are thus also described in this work .",
    "implications of the provided interpretations , in particular for the existence of a three - dimensional oscillatory instability in an inclined slot , are analyzed as well .",
    "this study also completes the understanding of steady convection due to different boundary conditions when a horizontal slot is transformed into an inclined and vertical slot .",
    "let compensating gradients of the contributions of two components to the density be maintained by different boundary conditions at the walls of a slot with pure fluid whose orientation to the gravity is characterized by angle @xmath0 .",

    "unless explicitly stated otherwise , @xmath17 and @xmath18 as well as @xmath19 are assumed .",
    "the component diffusivities are set equal to eliminate the effects of the classical double - diffusion .",
    "the effects of different boundary conditions could thus be analyzed separately from those of unequal diffusivities .",
    "such approach is analogous to that used in previous studies of conventional double - diffusive convection . in most such studies ,",
    "the components with unequal diffusivities have not been distinguished from each other in terms of boundary conditions .",
    "as indicated in @xcite , equal diffusivities can in principle be experimentally modeled with two solutes",
    ". the number would then be significantly different from the @xmath20 specified in the caption of fig .",
    "[ f : g ] .",
    "this parameter , however , is not expected to have a qualitative effect on the results and physical interpretations reported herein .",
    "equal diffusivities could also be interpreted as eddy transport coefficients , as in @xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath20 is not outside the range of realistic values corresponding to all diffusion coefficients being of the eddy type .",
    "the condition that the component gradients be exactly compensating ( @xmath19 ) eliminates the along - slot motion arising when the slot orientation differs from horizontal .",
    "( this condition has also been adopted in many previous studies of conventional double - diffusive convection @xcite . ) in the absence of such a background flow , comparison of the results for an inclined or vertical slot with those for the horizontal slot is substantially facilitated .",
    "the same could also be said about the comparison between the viscous and inviscid problems , for the along - slot base flows would have been dissimilar in such problems . in particular",

    "obtained from the long - wavelength expansion , @xmath77 at @xmath150 is not affected by the along - slot gravity component at all .",
    "however , the along - slot gravity component still has a stabilizing effect on small - amplitude steady perturbations with @xmath247 .",
    "this effect is manifested in that the interval of unstable wave numbers shrinks to the vicinity of @xmath150 and vanishes with @xmath0 decreasing from @xmath223 to @xmath188 .",
    "the effect of the along - slot gravity component still gives rise to finite - amplitude steady convection .",
    "in contrast to the finite - amplitude pattern of symmetric counter - rotating convective cells at @xmath2 , the convection pattern at @xmath21 comprises only clockwise - rotating cells .",
    "underlain by differential gradient diffusion , the basic nature of finite - amplitude convective steady flows at @xmath21 is however the same as that at @xmath2 .",
    "continuous transformation between these flows was thus demonstrated to take place at least up to @xmath224 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath222 $ ] , finite - amplitude convective steady flows at @xmath3 could not be continuously transformed into those at @xmath21 for @xmath224 .",
    "rather , a region of hysteresis in @xmath0 was demonstrated to develop above @xmath248 .",
    "such hysteresis phenomenon is a manifestation of the basic nature of finite - amplitude steady convection at @xmath3 being different from that at @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , differential gradient diffusion is a stabilizing factor with respect to the effect of the across - slot gravity component on finite - amplitude steady convection for @xmath241 .",
    "it is the opposite roles of this physical process in the effects of the across - slot and along - slot gravity components that prevents continuous transformation between the finite - amplitude steady flows at @xmath3 and @xmath21 .",
    "the reported mechanisms of double - component convection due to different component boundary conditions thus comprise two basic ingredients .",
    "these are the disparity between component stratifications caused by a convective perturbation and the resulting feedback that maintains amplitude growth of such a perturbation . for all slot orientations ,",
    "the feedback in small - amplitude oscillatory and steady convection is underlain by differential gradient diffusion .",
    "in particular , such universality of the nature of small - amplitude convection is manifested in the transformations of oscillatory marginal - stability curves into steady ones .",
    "finite - amplitude steady convection can however arise due to two dissimilar feedbacks .",
    "the role of differential gradient diffusion is destabilizing in one of them and stabilizing in the other .",
    "the disparity between component gradients in perturbed state is thus the only universal feature of the effects of different boundary conditions .",
    "this feature is however also independent of the physical nature of the forces responsible for the feedback .",
    "it could therefore be expected to give rise to instabilities when the forces generated by components are other than the buoyancy forces .",
    "analysis of such possibilities could provide a further insight into the effects of different boundary conditions ."
