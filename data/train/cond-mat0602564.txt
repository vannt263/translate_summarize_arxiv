    "diverse physical phenomena such as traffic flow  @xcite , force propagation in granular media  @xcite , clustering of buses  @xcite , aggregation and fragmentation of clusters  @xcite , phase separation dynamics  @xcite , shaken granular gases  @xcite and sandpile dynamics  @xcite share one common feature  their microscopic dynamics involves stochastic transport of ` mass ' , or some conserved quantity , from one point in space to another . to simplify analysis ,",
    "continuous space is typically replaced by ( or `` binned '' into ) discrete sites .",
    "several such lattice models of stochastic mass transport have been introduced and studied , most notably the zero - range process ( zrp )  @xcite , and the asymmetric random average process ( arap )  @xcite .",
    "these models are defined by specifying the microscopic dynamics , i.e. the basic stochastic rules for mass transport .",
    "given the dynamics , there are two principal theoretical issues : ( i ) to identify the steady state if there is any , i.e. to find the invariant measure and ( ii ) once the steady state is known , to understand various physical properties in the steady state , e.g. the phenomenon of ` condensation ' that happens when a finite fraction of the total mass condenses onto a single site  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the step ( i ) itself is often very difficult and the exact steady state is known in only very few cases  @xcite . in many of these known cases , the steady state is _",
    "factorisable_. this means that the steady state probability @xmath2 of finding the system with mass @xmath3 at site 1 , mass @xmath4 at site 2 etc is given by a product of ( scalar ) factors @xmath5  one factor for each of the @xmath0 sites of the system  e.g. for a homogeneous system where all sites @xmath6 have equivalent connectivities @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a normalisation which ensures that the integral of the probability distribution over all configurations containing total mass @xmath9 is unity , hence @xmath10 \\,\\delta \\!\\left ( \\sum_{i=1}^l m_i - m\\right ) \\;.    \\label{z}\\ ] ] here , the @xmath11-function has been introduced to guarantee that we only include those configurations containing mass @xmath9 in the integral .",
    "the single - site weights , @xmath12 are determined by the details of the mass transfer rules and for a heterogeneous system may depend on the site @xmath6 .",
    "the advantage of having a factorisable steady state is that the step ( ii ) mentioned above is often easier to carry out explicitly .",
    "this has been demonstrated recently by an exact analysis of the condensation phenomenon that occurs in a general class of mass transport models  @xcite .",
    "this raises a natural question : when does the steady state in these mass transport models factorise ?",
    "this issue was recently addressed in the context of a sufficiently general ` mass transport model ' in one dimension , that includes , as special cases , the previously studied zrp , arap and the chipping model  @xcite . in this model",
    "a mass @xmath13 resides at each site @xmath6 of a one dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions . at each time , a stochastic portion , @xmath14 of the mass @xmath13 at site @xmath6 , chosen from a distribution @xmath15 , is chipped off to site @xmath16 . the distribution @xmath17 was called the chipping kernel and by choosing its form appropriately one can recover the zrp , the arap and the chipping model of  @xcite .",
    "even though the model above is defined in discrete time where all sites are updated in parallel , by appropriately choosing the chipping kernel it is easy to study the continuous time limit , which corresponds to a random sequential update sequence , as a special case  @xcite .",
    "similarly , one can also recover , as a special case , the model with only discrete masses as in zrp .",
    "thus the discrete time dynamics generalises continuous time dynamics but a continuous mass variable generalises discrete mass .",
    "a natural question , first addressed in @xcite , is what should be form of the chipping kernel @xmath17 for the the final steady state to be factorisable . in that study",
    ", it was proved that the _ necessary and sufficient _",
    "condition for a factorised steady state in the one dimensional directed case defined above is that the chipping kernel is of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are arbitrary non - negative functions .",
    "then the single - site weight in eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) is given by @xmath21 furthermore , given a chipping kernel @xmath17 , sometimes it is hard to verify explicitly that it is of the form ( [ phi1 ] ) and thereby to identify the functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 in order to construct the weight @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ ffact ] ) .",
    "this problem was circumvented by devising a test  @xcite to check if a given explicit @xmath17 satisfies the condition ( [ phi1 ] ) or not .",
    "further , if it `` passes this test , '' the weight @xmath12 can be found explicitly  by a simple quadrature  @xcite . finally , for any desired function @xmath12 , one can construct dynamical rules ( i.e. , @xmath24 ) that will yield @xmath12 in a factorised steady state .",
    "it was further demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the corresponding necessary and sufficient condition in the case of random sequential dynamics in continuous time can be easily obtained , by taking a suitable limit , from the condition for the parallel dynamics manifest in eq .",
    "( [ phi1 ] ) .",
    "this is done by choosing the chipping kernel as @xmath25\\ , \\delta(\\tilde m ) + \\alpha(\\tilde m|m)\\ , dt    \\label{ct1}\\ ] ] for small time increment @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the dirac delta function .",
    "the function @xmath28 denotes the ` rate ' at which a mass @xmath29 is transferred from a site with mass @xmath30 to its right neighbour . note that the form in eq .",
    "( [ ct1 ] ) ensures the normalization , @xmath31 .",
    "then , the necessary and the sufficient condition for factorisable steady state , derived from the more general condition in eq .",
    "( [ phi1 ] ) , is that the rate @xmath28 must be of the following form  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath20 are arbitrary non - negative functions .",
    "the corresponding steady state weight is then simply , @xmath34 .",
    "the condition ( [ phi1 ] ) for factorisability in the mass transport model was derived only in one dimension and also only for unidirectional mass transport ( from site @xmath6 to site @xmath16 ) . a natural question ,",
    "therefore , is whether one can generalise this condition to higher dimensional lattices , or to arbitrary graphs where mass transport can take place , in general , between any pair of sites @xmath6 and @xmath35 .",
    "recently , greenblatt and lebowitz were able to derive a sufficiency condition  @xcite for factorisability in the mass transport model with nearest neighbour mass transport on a regular @xmath1-dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions , but considered only the case of random sequential dynamics .",
    "they showed that if @xmath36 is the probability of mass @xmath37 being chipped off a site with mass @xmath30 to a nearest neighbour in the direction @xmath38 ( there being @xmath39 nearest neighbours on a hypercubic lattice in @xmath1 dimensions ) , then the sufficient condition for factorisability is a direct generalization of the condition in eq .",
    "( [ ct2 ] ) , namely that the rate function must be of the form @xmath40 for each @xmath38 , where @xmath41 for each @xmath38 and @xmath20 are arbitrary functions .",
    "the steady state weight is simple , @xmath34 .",
    "however , it was not possible to prove that the condition ( [ gl1 ] ) is also necessary  @xcite , except in the case of generalized zero - range processes .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to derive a more general sufficiency condition , valid for arbitrary graphs where the mass transport takes place not necessarily between nearest neighbours and for the more general case of parallel dynamics .",
    "our results boil down to equations ( [ phi ] ) and ( [ cond ] ) .",
    "the former yields a sufficiency condition and the latter an additional consistency condition which must be satisfied .    in the special case of random sequential dynamics on a regular hypercubic lattice with nearest neighbour mass transport , our sufficiency condition reduces to the one derived by greenblatt and lebowitz .",
    "our results , however , are considerably more general .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we define the mass transport model on an arbitrary graph . in section 3 , we derive a sufficient condition on the chipping kernels , valid for parallel dynamics on an arbitrary graph @xmath42 , that would gaurantee that the steady state is factorisable .",
    "we show that there are some additional consistency conditions that need to be satisfied in general and we demonstrate explicitly how these conditions are satisfied in several examples . in section 4 , we extend our approach to random sequential dynamics on an arbitrary graph .",
    "we conclude with a summary and discussion in section 5 .",
    "we consider a fixed arbitrary graph @xmath42 consisting of @xmath0 nodes labelled @xmath43 and a set of directed links or channels between certain pairs of nodes . at a given time @xmath44 ,",
    "a node @xmath6 has mass @xmath45 where @xmath13 are continuous variables .",
    "we consider discrete time dynamics where at each step the masses at all the nodes are updated in parallel according to the following rules .",
    "we first define a @xmath46 mass - transfer matrix @xmath47 $ ] as follows .",
    "an element @xmath48 of the matrix @xmath47 $ ] is identically zero at all times if there is no directed link from site @xmath6 to site @xmath35 on @xmath49 .",
    "if there is a directed link from @xmath6 to @xmath35 , then @xmath50 is a non - negative stochastic variable that represents the mass transferred from site @xmath6 to site @xmath35 during one update . in fig .",
    "1 we give an example which we refer to for illustrative purposes throughout this section . the diagonal element @xmath51 represents the mass that stays at site @xmath6 at the end of the single update .",
    "we assume that the dynamics of mass transport conserves the total mass .",
    "thus if @xmath52 represents the masses before the update , by virtue of mass conservation , the row sums of the matrix @xmath47 $ ] are given by , @xmath53 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . similarly ,",
    "the column sum corresponding to a node @xmath6 , @xmath54 represents the mass at site @xmath6 just after the update .    note that , by definition , some elements of the matrix @xmath47 $ ] are permanently zero ( when there is no directed channel available for mass transfer between a pair of sites ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when there is an available channel from @xmath6 to @xmath35 , the matrix element @xmath48 is a stochastic variable which is chosen in the following way .",
    "for each node @xmath6 , we define a generalized ` chipping kernel ' @xmath55 that represents the joint distribution of the masses transported from site @xmath6 in a single update . here the set @xmath56 runs over only those sites @xmath35 which are connected to @xmath6 via a directed link , and in addition it includes the diagonal element @xmath51 . in other words , @xmath56 is simply the set of non - zero elements in the @xmath6-th row of the mass - transfer matrix @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "for example , in fig . 1 where we have a graph of four nodes along with the directed links , we need to define four chipping kernels as follows : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively .",
    "the chipping kernels must be normalized to unity at all sites @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath61 where it is implied that the index @xmath35 in the sum as well as in the product runs over all the sites that @xmath6 feeds into , including @xmath6 itself .",
    "thus in this model the amount of mass transported from a given site @xmath6 in one update depends only on that site @xmath6 , and not , e.g. on the destination sites to which the mass is transported .",
    "also , we assume that the chipping kernels @xmath55 do not contain the time @xmath44 explicitly .",
    "note also that this chipping kernel @xmath55 generalises that of @xcite sufficiently to include hypercubic lattices@xcite or more complicated graphs .",
    "an example graph with four nodes labelled @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 and directed links between certain pairs of nodes",
    ". the associated @xmath66 mass - transfer matrix @xmath47 $ ] is shown , whose element @xmath48 denotes the stochastic mass transferred from site @xmath6 to site @xmath35 in one single update , provided there is a directed link between the two sites .",
    "if there is no directed link , the corresponding matrix element is always identically zero .",
    "the diagonal element @xmath51 is the amount of mass that stays at site @xmath6 during the update .",
    "the row sum and the column sum associated with any node @xmath6 , @xmath53 and @xmath67 , represent respectively the mass at @xmath6 before and after the update.,width=384 ]    the chipping kernels thus specify the dynamics , i.e. the mass update rules .",
    "given these kernels , we next ask what is the steady state joint probability distribution of masses @xmath68 , i.e. @xmath69 .",
    "in particular , our goal is to determine the properties of the chipping kernels @xmath55 required in order to guarantee that the steady state joint probability distribution is factorisable , i.e. of the form @xmath70\\ ,",
    "\\delta\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^l m_i -m\\right ) \\label{gpm1}\\ ] ] where the normalization constant is given by @xmath71\\ , \\delta \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^l m_i   -m\\right ) . \\label{gpt1}\\ ] ] besides , if the steady state factorises as in eq .",
    "( [ gpm1 ] ) , we would also like to know the single - site weights @xmath72 in terms of the prescribed chipping kernels @xmath55 .",
    "note that on an arbitrary graph @xmath42 , the single - site weights @xmath72 are , in general , different from site to site .",
    "hence there is an additional subscript @xmath6 in @xmath72 . on a homogeneous graph , where all sites have equivalent connectivities ,",
    "the weight function @xmath12 does not depend on the site @xmath6 explicitly as in eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) .",
    "since the dynamics conserves the total mass , at any time @xmath44 we can write @xmath73 where @xmath9 is the total mass and @xmath74 is the unnormalized weight at time @xmath44 .",
    "below , we will first write down the general evolution equation of the weight @xmath74 under the mass transport rules prescribed by the chipping kernels . while the notations that we will use for a general graph @xmath42 may seem a bit complicated , it is instructive to keep the simple example in fig . 1 in mind and use it as a guide to the general notations .",
    "let us consider a single update from time @xmath44 to time @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath76 denote the masses at time @xmath44 before the update and @xmath77 denote the masses at time @xmath75 after the update . in terms of the elements of the mass - transfer matrix",

    "we can also check that the steady state for the continuous time zero - range process on an arbitrary graph is recovered .",
    "the zero - range process involves discrete masses and is specified by the rates for a a unit of mass to hop from site @xmath6 to @xmath35 . in the case where these rates are given by @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the total rate for the unit mass leaving site @xmath6 and @xmath187 is the probability that the random destination for a hop from site @xmath6 is @xmath35 , the steady state factorises with single - site weight @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the steady state probability of a single random walker moving from site @xmath6 to @xmath35 with probability @xmath187 @xcite .    to make the connection between the forms ( [ zrpag ] ) and ( [ condf1 ] ) we identify @xmath190 inverting the latter equality to express @xmath191 in terms of @xmath192 yields , by virtue of ( [ wrs2 ] ) , the single - site weight ( [ zrpagf ] ) .",
    "finally the consistency condition ( [ consrs1 ] ) becomes @xmath193 and is satisfied with @xmath194 since we have @xmath195",

    "the single - site weight is given by ( [ f ] ) .",
    "we gave in section [ sec : spec ] specific examples of geometries where the additional consistency condition associated with the sufficient condition is automatically fulfilled .",
    "moreover on a complete graph with permutationally invariant chipping functions we showed that the sufficent condition is , in fact , also necessary .",
    "of course a significant improvement would be to generalize condition ( [ phi],[cond ] ) to a necessary and sufficient condition . to illustrate the challenges involved in accomplishing this task , we offer another simple example where we can derive a condition that is both necessary and sufficient .",
    "this example , a seemingly trivial generalization of the one in @xcite , involves a one - dimensional lattice with chipping to both nearest neighbour sites and we also assume that the chipping kernel is translationally invariant ( @xmath196 in example 1 of section  [ sec : spec ] ) .",
    "then , due to the translational invariance , ( [ lt ] ) becomes @xmath197 using a similar procedure to that employed in example 4 of section  [ sec : spec ]  taking the logarithm of ( [ nesex ] ) then successive derivatives with respect to @xmath88 and @xmath135  we find that the general solution to ( [ nesex ] ) is @xmath198 where @xmath199 , @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 are arbitrary functions , independent of @xmath6 .",
    "inverting the laplace transforms to give @xmath203 would yield a considerably more complicated form for the chipping kernel @xmath204 than ( [ phi ] ) . in principle , therefore , there could be a whole family of chipping kernels , generated by the choice of @xmath202 , which give rise to the same steady state ( i.e. the same single - site weight @xmath12 ) as that for @xmath205 .",
    "thus , @xmath202 could be thought of as a `` gauge function '' .",
    "in addition , for each choice of @xmath202 , one has to ensure the consistency condition , namely that @xmath206 is correctly normalized to unity . on the face of it",
    ", it may appear that this imposes a formidable constraint on the choice of @xmath202 .",
    "however , we now show that this consistency condition does not impose any additional constraint on @xmath202 .",
    "in other words , if the consistency condition is ensured for @xmath205 , then it is automatically satisfied for all other choices of @xmath202 . to see this ,",
    "consider the expression of the chipping kernel ( [ phiex ] ) .",
    "now , the denominator @xmath5 is , of course , independent of the choice of @xmath202 .",
    "so , to prove that the consistency condition of normalization of @xmath24 does not impose any additional constraint on @xmath202 , one has to prove that the integral @xmath207 is independent of the choice of @xmath202 .",
    "now , taking the laplace transform of eq .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) one obtains @xmath208 where we have used definition ( [ lt ] ) in going from the first line to the second and eq .",
    "( [ exgen ] ) in going from the second line to the third .",
    "but this expression on the rhs does not contain the `` gauge function '' @xmath202 thereby proving that the integral of @xmath209 is independent of the choice of @xmath202 .",
    "thus the consistency condition is automatically fulfilled for arbitrary choices of @xmath202 as long as it is ensured for @xmath205 , which is indeed the case as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : spec ] example 1 .",
    "a more serious constraint on @xmath202 is that the inverse laplace transform of ( [ exgen ] ) must be _ non - negative_. the case @xmath205 in ( [ exgen ] ) obviously imposes the trivial constraint that the inverse laplace transform of the @xmath210 s be non - negative .",
    "it remains to be shown whether there is also a class of @xmath211 which lead to valid chipping kernels .",
    "if it could be shown that this class is non - empty , the one - dimensional @xmath196 example we have discussed would show explicitly that it is _ not _ necessary for @xmath24 to be of the form ( [ phi ] ) . mapping",
    "the extent of this class of @xmath202 ( if indeed it is non - empty ) remains a daunting task .",
