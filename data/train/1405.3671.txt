    "after post - selecting on the zero - frequency component of the transverse momentum , the real and imaginary parts of the optical field at the waveplate location are recovered by measuring the final polarization . the measurement is direct ; detector values are directly proportional to the real or imaginary parts of the signal .",
    "similar experiments have used weak measurement to trace the average trajectories of photons in the double slit experiment @xcite and to measure the polarization state of a qubit @xcite .",
    "the technique of lundeen et .",
    "al . is interesting because it has no inherent resolution limitation .",
    "however , their measurement process is very inefficient and difficult to scale to high spatial resolution .",
    "it requires a slow , physical raster scan of the piece of waveplate through the detection plane . because the polarization rotation is small ,",
    "long acquisition times are needed for sufficient signal - to - noise ratio , particularly at low light levels .",
    "these limitations make such a system impractical for many applications .    to solve these issues , we present a high resolution wavefront sensor that combines lundeen et .",
