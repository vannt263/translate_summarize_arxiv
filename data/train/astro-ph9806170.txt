    "the family of blazars includes those agn ( active galactic nuclei ) that are characterized by compact radio morphology and variable , polarized nonthermal continuum . apparent superluminal motion and @xmath5-ray emission are also",
    "common properties among blazars ( for a review of their properties see urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "when the spectrum exhibits the usual quasar - like broad emission lines , the object is classified as a flat spectrum radio quasar ( fsrq ) . on the other hand , the term bl lacertae object ( bl )",
    "is reserved for the lineless or almost lineless blazars .",
    "the parent population of fsrqs ( @xcite ) and bls ( @xcite ) is thought to consist of fanaroff - riley type ii ( fr ii ) and fanaroff - riley type i ( fr i ) radio galaxies ( @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "the standard interpretation of the nonthermal continuum radiation of blazars from radio to @xmath5 rays is synchrotron and inverse compton emission from a collimated relativistic plasma jet ( @xcite ) .",
    "the currently popular paradigm involves the existence and dynamical consequences of a magnetic field that threads an accretion disk around a massive black hole ( @xcite ) .",
    "the collimation and acceleration of the jet in such a scenario is currently a field of active research ; both analytical ( e.g. @xcite ) and numerical ( e.g. @xcite ) work shows promising results thus far .    the observational taxonomy of bls consists , according to the method of discovery , of radio selected ( rbls ) and x - ray selected ( xbls ) sources . according to padovani & giommi ( 1995 ) , this corresponds to a more physical dichotomy , based on the frequency at which the peak of the synchrotron spectral energy distribution ( sed , quantified by @xmath6 ) occurs : low - frequency peaked bls ( lbls ) , which are mostly rbls , and high - frequency peaked bl lac objects ( hbls ) , which are mostly xbls .",
    "the xbls are less variable and polarized than rbls ( @xcite ) and have flatter optical spectra ( @xcite ) .",
    "the rbls are more core - dominated ( @xcite ) and for a given x - ray luminosity are more luminous at radio and optical frequencies than xbls ( @xcite ) .",
    "rbls are characterized by a weak positive evolution ( i.e. , dependence of number counts on redshift ; @xcite ) , while xbls exhibit a negative evolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "the recent discovery of a population of intermediate bls ( @xcite ; @xcite ) suggests a continuous family of objects rather than two separate classes .",
    "maraschi et al .",
    "( 1986 ) proposed that the x - ray emission comes from a compact , less beamed region , while the radio emission comes from an extended , more beamed region . according to this `` orientation hypothesis '' , the rbls form a small angle ( @xmath7 ) between the line of sight and the direction of motion of the emitting plasma , while the xbls form a larger angle ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "a more recent interpretation of the differences between xbls and rbls ( @xcite ) is based on the cutoff frequency of the synchrotron sed . according to this `` sed - cutoff hypothesis , '' most of the bls",
    "are characterized by a cutoff in the ir / optical band , and these are the radio selected objects .",
    "the small fraction of bls that have a cutoff at uv / x - ray energies are the x - ray selected bl lac objects .",
    "this model does not offer a physical explanation for the different cutoff frequencies of the sed .",
    "there is an ongoing debate in the literature about the actual reason for the differences between xbls and rbls .",
    "padovani & giommi ( 1995 ) argue that the observed range of the core dominance parameter r ( the ratio of core to extended radio flux ) of the xbls does not agree with the orientation hypothesis . on the other hand , kollgaard et al .",
    "( 1996a ) conclude that the fact that the mean core radio power of rbls exceeds that of xbls by more than an order of magnitude for sources selected according to extended radio power , is incompatible with the sed - cutoff hypothesis .",
    "comparison of vlbi images of rbls and xbls ( @xcite ) suggests that the jets in xbls fade faster than in rbls , which supports the idea that factors other than orientation are also important in explaining the differences between xbls and rbls .",
    "urry & padovani ( 1995 ) note that the sed - cutoff hypothesis can not explain the different polarization properties of xbls and rbls , particularly the stability of the polarization angle in the xbls .",
    "lamer , brunner , & staubert ( 1996 ) analyze a sample of bl lac objects observed with the pspc detector on board the rosat satellite and note that the sed - cutoff hypothesis can explain the range of the crossover frequency between the soft and the hard components in the x - ray regime better than the orientation hypothesis .",
    "sambruna , maraschi , & urry ( 1996 ) , using complete samples of bls , reach the conclusion that the range of the peak frequency of the synchrotron energy distribution in bls can not be reproduced under the orientation hypothesis .",
    "an alternative scenario , which connects the synchrotron peak luminosity @xmath9 to the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath0 of the sed of the bls through an empirical relation , has been proposed recently by fossati et al .",
    "one feature that this scenario reproduces more successfully than the previous two is the redshift distribution of xbls and rbls .    in this work",
    "we propose that two parameters determine the observed characteristics of a bl .",
    "the first which must play a role , given the relativistic nature of the jet flow , is the angle @xmath1 formed between the line of sight and the jet axis .",
    "the second is the electron kinetic luminosity @xmath2 of the jet .",
    "we start by developing and testing a numerical code for the accelerating inner jet model , which we use as our working hypothesis for the physical description of the jet . invoking recent observational studies",
    ", we propose a new classification scheme , whose main observational parameter is the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath0 of the sed of bls .",
    "we then introduce the theoretical @xmath1@xmath10 unification for bls , based on two parameters : the angle @xmath1 between the jet axis and the line of sight , and the electron kinetic luminosity @xmath2 of the jet .",
    "these are coupled to a simple self - similar jet description that relates @xmath2 to the size of the jet ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we use the accelerating jet model to show how this unification scheme can be used to explain several characteristics of bls , including the negative apparent evolution of the xbls .",
    "we also show , using the self - similarity scenario we propose , that a picture in which bls have a scaled - down accretion disk and broad emission - line region ( belr ) environment similar to those observed in fsrqs and high polarization quasars ( hpqs ) , is in agreement with observations .",
    "( we will use the terms fsrq and hpq interchangeably to signify all the non - bl blazars ) .",
    "finally , we review observational evidence that supports a unified picture for all blazars under the above self - similar scheme .",
    "a first approach in calculating the synchrotron emission produced by an accelerating and collimating plasma flow was presented by marscher ( 1980 ) : in the accelerating inner jet model ( based on the work of @xcite and @xcite ) , continuously generated ultrarelativistic plasma is confined by pressure ( hydrostatic and/or magnetohydrodynamic ) that decreases along the jet axis .",
    "the internal energy of the plasma is converted to bulk kinetic energy and the jet is accelerated and focused .",
    "the electrons interact with a predominately random magnetic field and cool through synchrotron radiation and adiabatic expansion . at the same time , inverse compton losses become important when the synchrotron photon energy density becomes comparable to the magnetic field energy density .",
    "higher frequency radiation is emitted close to the base of the jet , since only there are the electron energies high enough to do so .",
    "lower frequency photons are emitted there as well as farther downstream .",
    "the velocity of the jet increases with distance ; this implies larger doppler boosting for greater distances down the jet and therefore at lower frequencies , out to the point where the lorentz factor @xmath12 .",
    "the relevance of this approach to the bl lac phenomenon was strengthened through studies that suggested that the x - ray emitting region is less relativistically boosted than that of the radio emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we use the following phenomenological description for the accelerating inner jet : ultrarelativistic plasma ( mean ratio of total to rest mass energy per particle @xmath13 in the proper frame of the fluid ) is continuously injected at the base of the jet .",
    "the bulk flow of the plasma at the injection point is parameterized by the bulk lorentz factor @xmath14 .",
    "the axially symmetric pressure profile , with the pressure on the symmetry axis being less than the equatorial pressure , defines a preferred direction for the expansion of the plasma .",
    "the plasma flow is progressively accelerated and collimated , converting its internal energy to bulk kinetic energy .",
    "the adopted phenomenological description of ultrarelativistic particle injection at the base of the jet can be linked , for example , to particle acceleration in a standing shock front in the plasma flow , formed due to a drop in the confining pressure ( @xcite ) . since the emission at higher frequencies",
    "is confined to a region closer to the base of the jet than at lower frequencies , we expect ( @xcite ; @xcite ) shorter variability timescales at higher frequencies , given that the acceleration of the flow is mild .",
    "in addition , the doppler effect is comparatively more important for the lower than for the higher frequencies . therefore the jet orientation affects the lower frequencies more than the higher ones .",
    "we adopt a flow description ( see appendix [ gas ] ) similar to that of blandford & rees ( 1974 ) and marscher ( 1980 ) , the latter of which considered as the base of the jet the sonic point , where the bulk lorentz factor has the value @xmath15 .",
    "if we identify the base of the jet instead with a standing shock , we can relax the assumption that the flow is sonic at the base of the jet , and allow for higher values of the bulk lorentz factor @xmath14 at that point .",
    "the minimum distance of the base of the jet from the accretion disk is obtained by requiring that the electron thomson losses due to the accretion disk photons are less significant than the synchrotron losses ( see appendix [ thomson ] ) .",
    "the quantities that describe the flow are the total ( electron + proton ) kinetic luminosity @xmath16 of the jet , the radius @xmath17 of the base of the jet , and the exponent @xmath18 and the length scale @xmath19 that describe how fast the jet opens and accelerates . assuming energy equipartition between electrons and protons , the electron kinetic luminosity @xmath2 is @xmath20 thus half of the injected energy is in protons that do not radiate , and",
    "therefore we can reasonably approximate the flow as adiabatic .",
    "the bulk lorentz factor as a function of distance along the jet axis is given by equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) : @xmath21 while the radius of the jet is given by a modified form of equation ( [ eq : radius ] ) : @xmath22 ^{-\\frac{1}{4}}.   \\label{eq : realradius}\\ ] ] for 3-d steady flow , this equation applies to each streamline , but with @xmath23 replaced by @xmath24 .",
    "the flow velocity is tangent to the streamlines and the loci of constant scalar quantities such as density are surfaces that are perpendicular to the streamlines .",
    "note that for @xmath15 equation ( [ eq : realradius ] ) is reduced to equation ( [ eq : radius ] ) .",
    "for the purpose of this work , we will consider the magnetic field to be mainly random in direction , with a small ordered component parallel to the jet axis . under the assumption of an isotropic electron distribution ( see   [ eed ] ) , the choice of magnetic field geometry is not critical , since we are interested here in the total and not the polarized flux .",
    "using simple flux conservation arguments , we assume that the magnetic field in the fluid frame decays as @xmath25 , or in terms of the jet axial coordinate @xmath26 : @xmath27\\times    \\left[\\gamma_{\\star}^{2}\\left(\\frac{z}{z_{\\star}}\\right)^{2\\epsilon}- 1\\right ] ^{\\frac{m}{4}}. \\label{eq : field}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      we assume that the electrons are injected at the base of the jet and propagate downstream while losing energy due to adiabatic and synchrotron energy losses , without any reacceleration ( except at downstream shocks fronts , the radiation from which is not considered here ) .",
    "the electrons will also suffer inverse compton losses from the synchrotron photons they produce ( synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) model , e.g. , @xcite ) as well as from photons coming either from the broad - line clouds ( @xcite ) or from the putative accretion disk ( @xcite ) ( external compton ( ec ) ) . in our treatment",
    "we require that the base of the jet is sufficiently far from the central engine , so that the electron thomson losses due to scattering of the accretion disk radiation are smaller than the synchrotron losses ( see appendix b ) .",
    "a self - consistent treatment of inverse compton scattering is extremely complicated , since the local photon energy density results from photons that have been emitted in different regions of the jet at different retarded times .",
    "observations using the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) suggest that during flares the compton luminosity is usually greater than the synchrotron in fsrqs by @xmath28 12 orders of magnitude , but is comparable to , or less than , the synchrotron luminosity in bls , and during low states of @xmath5-ray activity the synchrotron luminosity dominates the power output in bls . in ssc models",
    "the beaming cone of the synchrotron and compton radiation is the same , and the ratio of apparent luminosities of the two components equals the ratio of synchrotron to compton electron losses .    in ec models",
    "the beaming cone of the inverse compton radiation is more narrow than the synchrotron cone ( @xcite ) .",
    "statistically , in the case of ec models , even if compton losses are equal to the synchrotron losses , in any bl sample selected at frequencies dominated by synchrotron emission , one would expect that the compton luminosity would be significantly greater than the synchrotron one for a fraction of the sources equal to the ratio of the beaming cone solid angles .",
    "since this is not observed , it seems plausible to assume that the compton losses even in ec dominated bl models are not the main energy loss mechanism for bls .",
    "we combine the adiabatic and synchrotron losses to obtain the electron energy - loss equation in the fluid frame :    @xmath29&= & -c_1\\gamma^2\\left(\\frac{z}{z_{\\star}}\\right)^{-3m\\epsilon }     ( \\gamma_{\\star}^{2}-1 ) ^{-\\frac{m}{2 } }    \\nonumber \\\\[0.25 cm ] & & \\times    \\left[\\gamma_{\\star}^{2}\\left(\\frac{z}{z_{\\star}}\\right)^{2\\epsilon}- 1\\right ] ^{\\frac{m-1}{2}}-\\frac{\\epsilon \\gamma}{z } , \\label{eq : losses}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath30    since @xmath31 while @xmath32 , synchrotron losses dominate for the higher energy electrons . the lorentz factor",
    "@xmath5 describes the internal kinetic energy of the electrons in the fluid proper frame . solving for the electron energy",
    ", we obtain    @xmath33^{-1 } , \\label{eq : gamma}\\ ] ]    where the integral @xmath34 must be solved numerically for @xmath35 .",
    "the eed is , in principle , determined by the particle acceleration and the dominant energy loss mechanisms acting simultaneously on the electrons ( @xcite ) .",
    "these two factors should determine the shape and the cutoffs of the distribution .",
    "in our model we assume that the initially injected eed has a power law form : @xmath36.\\ ] ] we further assume that the initial electron energy distribution ( eed ) remains isotropic in the comoving frame , through redistribution of the electron pitch angles due to their scattering on plasma waves .",
    "the eed distribution is therefore a function of energy and position along the jet axis only .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath37 is related to the comoving energy density @xmath38 at the base of the jet @xmath39 using equation ( [ eq : lambda ] ) for the base of the jet ( @xmath40 ) and the relation @xmath41 ( see appendix [ gas ] ) , together with the assumed energy equipartition between electrons and protons ( @xmath42 ) , we obtain    @xmath43    in our treatment it is implicitly assumed that the acceleration time is much shorter than the radiative loss time for the considered frequencies , and we can therefore separate the region where acceleration takes place from the radiative zone .",
    "this assumption may break down for the highest synchrotron frequencies , although even in extreme objects like mkn 421 the 110 kev variability behavior indicates that this assumption is valid ( @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore consider this approach adequate for synchrotron radiation with photon energy up to @xmath44 kev .",
    "conservation of particles and eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) give the evolved energy distribution : @xmath45   \\left(1- \\gamma \\left(\\frac{z}{z_{\\star}}\\right)^{\\epsilon }",

    "note also that the eed evolves as the plasma moves downstream .",
    "this gives rise to a non - power law locally emitted synchrotron spectrum in the local flow frame , which changes with @xmath26 in frequency cutoff and shape .",
    "given the magnetic field and the eed in the local fluid proper frame we can calculate the synchrotron emission coefficient in the fluid frame using standard synchrotron formulae ( @xcite ) : @xmath46 \\times                            \\int_{\\gamma_{min}(z)}^{\\gamma_{max}(z)}n(\\gamma , z)f(x)d\\gamma , \\label{eq : emcoef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 @xmath48 is the modified bessel function of order @xmath49 and @xmath50 a dimensionless frequency : @xmath51 where @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : emcoef ] ) @xmath53 is the angle between the magnetic field and the line of sight in the fluid frame . in order to calculate this angle",
    "we first need to transform the angle @xmath54 between the line of sight and the local flow velocity from the observer s frame to the fluid frame using standard relativistic aberration formulae ( @xcite ) :    @xmath55    having now the angle @xmath56 between the line of sight and the local flow velocity in the local fluid frame , we can obtain @xmath53 from the angle between the magnetic field and the local flow velocity in the fluid proper frame .    to transform the emission coefficient to the observer s ( unprimed ) frame",
    "we need to take into account the transformations between this frame and the fluid ( primed ) frame .",
    "if @xmath26 is the redshift and @xmath57 is the doppler boosting factor , where @xmath54 is the angle between the sight and the fluid velocity , then the frequency in the observer s frame is @xmath58 and the emission coefficient is ( @xcite ) : @xmath59 having now the synchrotron emission coefficient in the observer s frame , we can perform the radiative transfer and calculate the total synchrotron flux for optically thin frequencies .",
    "we have performed an extensive study of the model parameter space in order to examine the response of the resultant sed to a variation of each physical parameter about the fiducial values given in table [ tbl1 ] .",
    "the meaning of the symbols is the same as in  [ model ] . in figure [ parameters ] we allow one of the model parameters to vary in each panel and plot the resulting sed .",
    "as @xmath18 increases ( corresponding to a more poorly collimated jet ) the peak apparent synchrotron luminosity @xmath9 decreases .",
    "this is due to an increase of the adiabatic losses and a decrease of the synchrotron power ( cf . eq .",
    "[ eq : losses ] ) , regardless of the value of @xmath60 . at the same time",
    "the peak frequency @xmath0 of the sed increases , since the synchrotron losses decrease , and the effective break of the eed shifts to higher energies .",
    "an increase in the magnetic field amounts to an increase in @xmath9 and a decrease in @xmath0 .",
    "this is expected since a higher magnetic field results in higher synchrotron power and hence losses , primarily for the higher energy electrons .",
    "the behavior of the sed as we increase @xmath14 is less straightforward . as @xmath14 increases , @xmath0 increases , the ir luminosity decreases , the x - ray luminosity increases , and @xmath9 increases until @xmath14 exceeds a critical value , beyond which it decreases .",
    "the key in understanding this behavior is that the jet emission is stratified , with the higher frequencies , which emerge closer to the base of the jet , being characterized by smaller lorentz factors .",
    "as we increase @xmath14 , the effective lorentz factor @xmath61 for each frequency increases , and the angle ( @xmath62 ) into which the radiation is beamed decreases . in the ir regime ( for the parameters chosen in table [ tbl1 ] ) an increase in @xmath14 beams most of the radiation into a cone with an opening angle smaller than @xmath1 ; this causes the doppler de - amplification we observe . in x",
    "- rays the increase in @xmath14 beams the radiation into a narrower cone that still includes the line of sight and therefore the observed luminosity is more doppler boosted .",
    "this frequency - dependent response causes @xmath0 to shift toward higher frequencies .",
    "@xmath9 increases as long as the doppler boosting of the higher frequencies can compensate for the doppler de - amplification at the lower frequencies .",
    "after a certain point ( for the parameter values we use , this occurs at @xmath63 ) , the observed peak luminosity declines , since most of the emitted power is beamed into a cone that does not include our line of sight .",
    "an increase in @xmath19 produces a behavior similar to that exhibited by the increase in @xmath64 .",
    "this is expected , since an increase in @xmath19 causes the magnetic field to decline more slowly with time in the electron s frame .",
    "that is , the electron spends more time in the roughly uniform magnetic field region as the size of that region increases .",
    "an increase in @xmath65 ( a steeper eed ) produces a steeper spectrum , as expected . as the eed becomes steeper , the energy content of the high energy tail of the eed decreases .",
    "since these are the electrons that lose energy faster and emit at higher frequencies , both @xmath9 and @xmath0 decrease as the eed becomes steeper .",
    "an increase in the upper cutoff @xmath66 of the eed affects dramatically the high frequency tail of the sed , making the x - ray spectrum flatter and increasing both @xmath9 and @xmath0 .",
    "the effect on the low frequencies is minimal , as expected , since the high energy electrons radiate a small fraction of their power there .",
    "the behavior of the sed resembles that described by padovani & giommi ( 1995 ) , who attribute the cause of the differences between xbls and rbls to different values of @xmath66 .",
    "the exponent @xmath60 , which describes the evolution of the comoving magnetic field along the jet axis , and the radius of the jet @xmath17 ( not shown in figure [ parameters ] ) only weakly affect the sed .",
    "increasing m from m=1 to m=2 decreases the ir luminosity by a factor of @xmath67 , while the x - ray luminosity remains essentially the same .",
    "increasing @xmath17 by a factor of four reduces the x - ray luminosity by a factor of @xmath68 , while the ir luminosity remains constant .",
    "note , however , that in a time dependent simulation the minimum variability timescale [ @xmath69 provides an upper limit to @xmath17 .",
    "the value of the lower cutoff @xmath70 of the eed should in principle be derived from the particle acceleration theory . for a given jet electron kinetic luminosity , as @xmath70 increases , the particle density and the observed synchrotron luminosity increase , since the average energy per particle increases .",
    "hence , @xmath2 and @xmath70 are closely connected and only one ( @xmath2 ) needs to be treated as a free parameter unless the value of the density is needed . for the purpose of this work we will assign the values @xmath60=1 and @xmath71 .    for a given physical description of the jet ,",
    "the angle @xmath1 between the jet axis and the line of sight is still a free parameter , in the sense that the jet can be oriented at any angle relative to the line of sight .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , one of the leading scenarios for the interpretation of the differences between rbls and xbls is based on the orientation of the jet relative to the line of sight .",
    "we have run our simulation using the parameters of table [ tbl1 ] , and have allowed the angle to vary , as presented in figure [ angle ] .",
    "the data points refer to the 1 jy sample of rbls ( triangles ) and the _ einstein extended medium sensitivity survey sample of xbls used by sambruna et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . as can be seen in the bottom panel , as the angle increases from @xmath72 to @xmath73 the synchrotron luminosity @xmath9 decreases by a factor of @xmath74 and the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath0 increases by @xmath75 orders of magnitude . at the same time",
    "the spectrum becomes flatter at all frequencies .",
    "the synchrotron peak luminosity @xmath9 ( middle panel ) and the optical to x - ray spectral index @xmath76 ( top panel ) , calculated taking into account the luminosities at @xmath77  and at 1 kev , are plotted versus the peak frequency @xmath0 of the sed .",
    "note that the model point shifts from a predominately rbl region to a predominately xbl region in both the luminosity and spectral index plots , as the angle increases .",
    "this behavior is not specific to the set of model parameters used here , but appears in a qualitatively similar manner for a wide range of initial conditions : as the angle increases , @xmath9 decreases , @xmath0 increases , and the spectrum becomes flatter .",
    "although these differences are similar to the differences found between xbls and rbls , previous work ( sambruna et al .",
    "1996 ; @xcite ) has shown that a change only in the jet orientation is not enough to explain the range of observed properties of bls , hence additional physical differences must be invoked . _      as an application of the model we simulate the sed of pks 2155304 , a relatively nearby ( redshift @xmath78=0.116 ) bright xbl .",
    "its @xmath5-ray luminosity is less than its synchrotron ( @xcite ) , which implies ( see also section [ losses ] ) that synchrotron losses are more important than inverse compton losses .",
    "the object has been the target of two intensive multiwavelength campaigns , one during november 1991 ( @xcite ) , and one during may 1994 ( @xcite ) .    since",
    "pks 2155304 is highly variable and a strictly simultaneous sed is practically unattainable , we must approximate a simultaneous sed with one constructed from fluxes measured during a time interval smaller or at least comparable to the timescale of the fastest significant variations .",
    "the shortest variability timescale for the november 1991 dataset was @xmath79 days .",
    "we construct the sed plotted in figure [ 2155 ] using observations in the time interval between november 14.0 and 14.76 .",
    "this time interval is approximately equal to the fastest variability timescale observed , and it corresponds to a local flux minimum for the optical to x - ray frequency range .",
    "the solid curve in figure [ 2155 ] represents the best - fit model .",
    "the values of the parameters used are given in table [ tbl2 ] .",
    "the @xmath80 for this fit is 49.65 for nine degrees of freedom .",
    "this high value can be partly attributed to the arbitrariness of the selected observed fluxes used to construct the `` base '' observed sed , but in any case is typical of fits to multiwavelength spectra with non - complex models .",
    "since an exhaustive exploration of the parameter space is practically impossible , we can not assert that this is the best possible fit . to derive a more constrained description of the source",
    ", we would need to model successfully the observed variability behavior .",
    "bl lac objects are discovered mostly through x - ray or radio surveys .",
    "the existing complete samples therefore are either x - ray ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or radio flux - limited samples ( @xcite ) and bls are named xbl ( x - ray selected ) or rbl ( radio selected ) , depending on the method of discovery . in general rbls have steeper spectra than do xbls .",
    "the seds of rbls peak somewhere in the infrared and have a higher synchrotron peak luminosity @xmath9 than do the xbls , which usually peak in the uv  soft x - ray range ( sambruna et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "a recently proposed classification scheme for bls ( @xcite ) corresponds more closely to the observed characteristics of the objects than the method of discovery . according to this scheme bls",
    "are classified as high frequency peak bls ( hbl ) or low frequency peak bls ( lbl ) , depending on the value of the x - ray to radio flux ratio .",
    "objects with @xmath81 are classified as lbls and objects with @xmath82 as hbls .",
    "most of the hbls are xbls and most of the lbls are rbls .",
    "although this classification scheme is based on observed properties of bls , it inherits the dichotomization of bl lac objects that was imposed by the two different discovery methods .",
    "such a dichotomization can hinder our efforts to understand the physics of bls , particularly if the two methods of discovery force us to observe the two extremes of a continuous distribution , thereby introducing a selection - induced bimodality .",
    "strong indications that a bimodality is introduced by the observational techniques come from a recent study by laurent - muehleisen ( 1997 ) .",
    "the cross - correlation of the rosat all sky survey ( rass ) and the green bank 5 ghz radio survey revealed the existence of a previously highly undersampled population of bls ( 120 objects ) with properties intermediate between those of xbls and rbls . specifically , the x - ray to radio flux ratio of these sources and their location on a diagram of radio to optical ( @xmath83 ) versus optical to x - ray ( @xmath84 ) spectral index bridge the gap between xbls and rbls .",
    "similar results ( @xcite ) are emerging from the deep x - ray radio blazar survey ( dxrbs ) .",
    "the question that naturally arises is whether there is an observed quantity that varies in a continuous fashion , has a well defined physical significance , and can be used as a classifying parameter .",
    "we argue that such a quantity is the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath0 .",
    "recently , sambruna et al . ( 1996 ) examined the multifrequency spectral properties of three complete samples of blazars : the _ einstein extended medium sensitivity survey sample ( emss ) of xbls ( 23 sources ; @xcite ) , the @xmath85 jy sample of rbls ( 29 sources ; @xcite ) , and a small complete sample of fsrq from the s5 survey ( 8 sources ; @xcite ) . after they calculated the rest - frame fluxes and spectral indices for each object , they fit a parabola to the synchrotron power ( @xmath6 ) spectrum .",
    "x - ray fluxes were excluded from the fitting in the cases in which the x - ray spectral index @xmath86 was flatter than the broadband optical to x - ray spectral index @xmath84 , a condition that is thought to indicate that inverse compton radiation dominates over the steep high - energy synchrotron tail of the spectrum . in figure",
    "[ npeak]a  f we plot the spectral indices @xmath84 , @xmath83 , @xmath87 , the x - ray concavity index @xmath88 , and the synchrotron bolometric @xmath89 and peak @xmath9 luminosities as a function of the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath0 for the two bl samples of sambruna et al .",
    "if we consider the two samples collectively , we find that in all six diagrams there is an upper envelope separating the populated area from a well - defined zone of avoidance .",
    "the upper envelope is such that for a given peak frequency @xmath0 there is a range of `` avoided '' luminosities and spectral indices . as @xmath0 increases , the maximum observed luminosity decreases , the steepest observed spectral index flattens , and the maximum observed concavity index @xmath88 decreases .",
    "on the other hand , the flattest spectral indices observed and the most negative concavity indices do not seem to be very sensitive to the value of @xmath0 . _    we propose a continuous classification system for bls , based on the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath0 of the synchrotron sed .",
    "for example , a bl peaking at @xmath90 will be classified as a bl14 .",
    "the class of a bl lac object then defines the maximum luminosity of the object , the maximum steepness of its synchrotron spectrum over a range of frequencies , and the maximum concavity index .",
    "we note here that ( unlike the transient variability mentioned before ) long term , persistent changes in @xmath0 , should be reflected in the classification of the object .",
    "the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath0 of a bl is a very important parameter from a physical point of view as well .",
    "it is the frequency in which we receive the highest synchrotron power per logarithmic frequency interval .",
    "it is also closely related to the peak of the inverse compton emission in both the ssc ( @xcite ) and the ec models ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this frequency is closely linked to the the energetics and geometry of the synchrotron source and to the angle formed between the observer and the plasma velocity , if the source is moving relativistically ( see  [ results ] ) .",
    "as sambruna et al .",
    "( 1996 ) point out , the determination of @xmath0 requires simultaneous multiwavelength flux measurements and can be particularly sensitive to a lack of flux measurements close to the peak of the distribution .",
    "the problem of multiwavelength coverage becomes more difficult when @xmath0 happens to be either in the observationally inaccessible frequency range between sub  mm and infrared frequencies @xmath91 hz , or in the uv due to galactic absorption . if @xmath0 is in the x - ray energy range , and there are no flux measurements to constrain the parabola at frequencies higher than @xmath0 , the error in @xmath0 can be very large .",
    "this is the case for the two sources that have @xmath92 , the xbl 1433.5 + 6369 , and the rbl 2005 - 489 ( see fig . 4 of sambruna et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ) , which we decided not to consider further in our study .",
    "in general , the error in the determination of @xmath0 should be smaller for objects with seds peaking at ir / optical frequencies , where @xmath0 is more easily constrained .",
    "we note , however , that even though @xmath0 is difficult to measure exactly , an approximate estimate within a decade of frequency is both feasible and adequate for the purpose of classification .",
    "furthermore , the accuracy can be improved if one decides to perform multiwavelength observations with this specific goal in mind , instead of using the available data from the literature .",
    "variability can also affect @xmath0 . in the case of individual flares ,",
    "initially the spectrum hardens ( @xcite ) and the peak synchrotron frequency increases .",
    "this change is temporary , and the source returns to its pre  flare characteristics after the end of the flare .",
    "the most extreme recorded case of such a shift occurred in mkn 501 , that increased its synchrotron peak frequency by more than a factor of 100 , changing form a bl17 to a bl19 ( @xcite ) .",
    "usually , though , the shift in @xmath0 , something neither easily nor customarily calculated in multiwavelength studies , is approximately a factor of 10 in the case of the few well documented , large amplitude flares . in the case of mkn 421 during the may 1994 ( @xcite ) and the april  may 1995 ( @xcite ) campaigns , @xmath0 increased by a factor @xmath93@xmath94 , while during the pks 2155 - 304 may 1994 campaign , @xmath0 increased by less than a factor of 10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "since these excursions of @xmath0 are usually of the same magnitude as the uncertainty in measuring @xmath0 , and also of a transient character , we do not consider them a serious problem in assigning a specific @xmath0 to a bl , regardless of variability .    under our proposed unified classification based on @xmath0 , the questions that can direct us toward a physical unification are : ( 1 ) which are the physical and/or geometrical parameters that , given their range of values ,",
    "create the range of the observed phenomenology ? ( 2 ) can a model incorporate these parameters and derive the properties of complete samples of bl lac objects ? in the following section we propose a simple unification scheme based on a self  similar jet description .",
    "in order to the extended region that bls occupy in the diagrams of figure [ npeak ] , we need to employ a model with at least two free parameters .",
    "any model with only one free parameter can at best trace a curved trajectory in the observational graphs when this free parameter is allowed to vary . under the assumption that the jets of bls are relativistic , a change in the angle between the line of sight and the jet axis will induce a model - dependent change in the observed properties of the source .",
    "it therefore seems necessary to postulate minimally the existence of a physical free parameter that , together with the angle , is capable of reproducing the observed range of properties of bls .",
    "the concept that relativistic jets can be described in a scale - invariant way using a self - similar description is very appealing , since these physical configurations span a luminosity range greater than ten orders of magnitude , from the jets in stellar systems in our galaxy to the most extreme fsrqs .",
    "maraschi & rovetti ( 1994 ) , after studying samples of bls , fsrq , and fri and frii radio galaxies , suggested that all these sources operate in a self similar way , with the jet luminosity and angle between the line of sight and the jet axis accounting for the different observed properties .",
    "gear ( 1993 ) studied the infrared colors of two complete samples of rbls and xbls , and hinted toward a bl unification based on the luminosity and the angle between the line of sight and the jet axis .",
    "we propose that the second , physical unification parameter is the electron kinetic luminosity of the jet @xmath2 . at first view",
    ", one would be tempted to assume that @xmath97 , since the eddington luminosity scales with the black hole mass , which is proportional to the gravitational radius of the black hole . however , tying the luminosity of the system to the black hole mass can not address the evolutionary characteristics of bls .",
    "the black hole mass slowly increases , due to accretion of fresh material , and this translates into a slow increase of the luminosity , which essentially translates to a weak negative cosmological evolution , i.e. , each source becomes more powerful as cosmic time increases .",
    "we know that this is the case neither for rbls ( see   [ evolution ] ) , nor for all the other radio  loud agn families ( @xcite ) , which we presume are described by the same paradigm  a massive black hole , an accretion disc , and a relativistic jet .",
    "an alternative description has been proposed by rees et al .",
    "( 1982 ) . under this scheme ,",
    "the electromagnetic power @xmath98 extracted from of a rapidly rotating black hole is proportional to @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is a length that measures the specific angular momentum @xmath101 of the black hole , and @xmath102 is the gravitational radius of the black hole .",
    "assuming now that @xmath98 and @xmath103 are related linearly to @xmath2 and @xmath17 correspondingly , we propose that @xmath2 scales as @xmath104 : @xmath105 under this scheme , the main cause for evolution is the spin down of the black hole , manifested as a decrease of @xmath103 due to the continuous energy extraction . this way the power of the source decreases with cosmic time , giving rise to the observed positive cosmological evolution , in the sense that sources were more powerful in the past ( the apparent negative evolution of xbls is addressed in   [ evolution ] ) .",
    "we additionally assume that the intensive physical variables that describe the relativistic jet in bls , such as the magnetic field , the comoving plasma density , and the high energy cutoff of the injected electron energy distribution , all vary over a small intrinsic range of values . the combination of these two assumptions suggests a unification scheme in which the observed properties of a bl depend mainly on the electron kinetic luminosity @xmath106 of the jet and the angle between the line of sight and the jet axis @xmath1 . a similar scaling relation has been discovered observationally between the size @xmath107 of the broad emission line region ( belr ) and the central ( accretion disk ) ionizing luminosity @xmath108 of seyfert galaxies and quasars ( @xcite ) using reverberation mapping : @xmath109 this scaling law implies an ionization parameter @xmath110 ( ratio of ionizing photon density to electron density ) that has a small intrinsic range of values ( @xmath111 ) for objects that extend in luminosity over almost four orders of magnitude ( @xcite ) .",
    "observational arguments , suggestive of a self  similar description of radio - loud agn , have been presented by rawlings and saunders ( 1991 ) , who find that the kinetic luminosity of the kpc - scale jet is proportional to the narrow emission line luminosity .",
    "this relation holds for objects with or without broad emission lines and extends for more than four orders of magnitude in luminosity . in a similar study , celotti , padovani , & ghisellini ( 1997 )",
    "find that @xmath112 and the pc - scale kinetic luminosity of the jet for a sample of radio loud agn are of the same order of magnitude . as recent studies of radio loud agn suggest ( e.g. @xcite ) , the belr is probably ionized by thermal radiation from the central engine , rather than by the jet radiation .",
    "we adopt as a working hypothesis a picture in which the ionizing luminosity of the accretion disk @xmath108 , the jet electron kinetic luminosity @xmath2 , and the belr luminosity @xmath113 are closely related , scaling as @xmath114 where @xmath17 is a dimension that characterizes the jet .",
    "we stress here that this scaling assumption does not refer to a specific jet model , but is a rather general , model independent hypothesis that can be applied to specific jet models .",
    "we apply this self  similar scheme to the accelerating jet model .",
    "the question we address here is whether we can populate the @xmath115@xmath9 diagram of figure [ npeak]f , under the assumptions that the jet electron kinetic luminosity scales with the square of the jet size , and that the physical parameters which describe the jet have a small intrinsic range of values .",
    "we perform calculations using two somewhat different families of values for the physical parameters , listed in table [ tbl3 ] . for each family",
    "we run the simulation for a range of angles and luminosities , scaling the square of @xmath17 and @xmath19 with the electron kinetic luminosity @xmath2 .",
    "the results of this set of simulations can be seen in figure [ uni ] .",
    "the solid curves represent calculated values of @xmath9 for a constant electron kinetic luminosity and size as the angle @xmath1 varies between @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "the dash  dot curves correspond to constant angle as the electron kinetic luminosity @xmath2 increases from @xmath10 to @xmath118 , where @xmath119 erg s@xmath120 .",
    "this increase in luminosity is accompanied by an increase in the jet size : @xmath17 and @xmath19 increase by a factor of 16 , starting at @xmath121 cm and @xmath122 cm .",
    "the qualitative behavior of both model families is the same . for a given electron kinetic luminosity , as the angle @xmath123 increases , the peak frequency @xmath0 increases and the peak apparent luminosity @xmath124 decreases . for a constant angle , as @xmath2 decreases",
    ", there is a drastic decrease in @xmath125 and a milder increase in @xmath0 .",
    "the two families of models generated by these somewhat different physical descriptions cover a significant portion of the observed range of values .",
    "this behavior is not specific to the above choice for the physical parameters : a different set of jet parameters would generate a pattern similar to those obtained by the models of fig .",
    "[ uni]/table [ tbl3 ] .",
    "modest changes in the physical description merely move the grid around the observed parameter space .",
    "a small range of values for the physical description of the jet , coupled with the @xmath1@xmath10 scheme , can populate the @xmath0@xmath9 diagram for bls .",
    "choosing the appropriate set of jet parameters , the @xmath1@xmath10 scheme can produce synthetic spectra of bl18bl19 sources .",
    "we choose not to do so , since the determination of @xmath0 for the two sources with @xmath126 in sambruna et al .",
    "( 1996 ) is problematic .",
    "the conclusion reached previously by sambruna et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and georganopoulos and marscher ( 1996 ) that the range of @xmath0 can not be explained merely by jet orientation is supported by this study . however , a combination of jet orientation and a relatively small range in the physical parameters that describe the jet can explain the range of @xmath0 under the @xmath1@xmath10 scheme .",
    "a quantitative comparison , including specific assumptions about the range of the physical parameters and extensive comparison of synthetic samples to existing samples , does not seem worthwhile until the parameters can be more strictly constrained , for example through analyses of multiwavelength variability .",
    "one might naively expect that , for a given angle , since the jet electron kinetic luminosity and size scale in a self  similar fashion , the sed would follow this self  similar behavior by scaling up or down , following the electron kinetic luminosity and keeping its shape and peak frequency the same .",
    "an important feature emerging from our simulations is that for a constant angle , as the electron kinetic luminosity and the size of the jet increase , the peak frequency decreases .",
    "this means that , although the jet scales in a self  similar manner , this self ",
    "similarity is not transfered completely to the sed , since the peak frequency changes .",
    "the reason for this break - down is that the effects of synchrotron losses ( cf .",
    "[ eq : dens ] and the discussion of   [ parspace ] ) on @xmath0 do not follow scaling laws that are qualitatively similar to those that govern the behavior of @xmath127 at @xmath128 .",
    "for example , if the values of @xmath17 and @xmath19 were doubled while holding @xmath64 constant , @xmath0 would decrease because the electrons would suffer more severe synchrotron losses as they traverse the characteristic distance @xmath19 before encountering the region of the jet where b decreases .",
    "the evolution of all the agn families is positive , in the sense that these objects were either more common or more luminous ( or both ) in the past .",
    "a unique and striking exception is the negative evolution of xbls : morris et al .",
    "( 1991 ) showed that the evolution of the emss xbl sample is negative .",
    "it seems that these objects were either less common or less luminous in the past .",
    "this has been verified recently by perlman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the rosat pspc sample of xbls , with @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the volume of a sphere with radius equal to the distance to each object and @xmath131 is the available volume within which each object could have been detected in the emss .",
    "this result is in contrast to the value @xmath132 obtained by stickel et al .",
    "( 1991 ) for the 1 jy rbl sample .",
    "this negative evolution of xbls can be explained naturally in the framework of the @xmath1@xmath10 scheme , under the assumption commonly invoked for agn that the electron kinetic luminosity @xmath2 of the radio  loud agn jets has a positive evolution , viz .",
    "jets ( on average ) in agn had a higher @xmath2 in the past . as we showed in   [ apply ] for a given set of physical parameters and angle @xmath1 , as @xmath2 decreases , the peak synchrotron apparent luminosity @xmath9 decreases and the peak synchrotron frequency @xmath0 increases , essentially shifting the source from the region of the rbl - type objects toward that of the xbl - type objects .",
    "if we start with a sample of sources characterized by a range of @xmath2 and @xmath1 and let these sources evolve to lower values of electron kinetic luminosity @xmath106 , then each source will gradually ( with cosmological time ) shift its characteristics to become more xbl - like .",
    "this means that the fraction of sources that would be classified as rbls will gradually decrease with time / redshift , resulting in @xmath133 in a radio - flux limited sample , while the fraction of sources that would be classified as xbls will gradually decrease and yield @xmath134 in an x - ray flux - limited sample .",
    "our model predicts that the value of @xmath135 of an intermediate bl sample , such as that of laurent - muehleisen ( 1997 ) , will be confined between the corresponding values of @xmath136 for the xbl and rbl samples mentioned above , exhibiting almost no evolution ( @xmath137 ) , since the population of intermediate bls on one hand will gain members from the rbls , and will lose members to the xbls as cosmic time increases .",
    "in fact , a very recent report ( @xcite ) agrees with this prediction . bade et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have studied a new sample of xbls selected from rass .",
    "they subdivide their sample into two halves according to the x - ray to optical flux ratio and find that the extremely x - ray dominated subgroup shows negative evolution , while the subgroup with intermediate seds is compatible with no evolution at all .",
    "they also find , however , that the extremely x - ray dominated subgroup has higher x - ray luminosity and redshift than the intermediate subgroup , an effect that does not seem to agree with our model .",
    "the discussion in   [ basic ] implicitly treats bls as agns with a belr and a central isotropic source of thermal ionizing radiation , essentially reducing the differences between bls and fsrq .",
    "the original definition of a bl lac object includes the criterion of absent or weak ( equivalent width @xmath139  ) emission lines ( @xcite ) .",
    "this has led most workers in the field to assume that either the gaseous environment near the central engine of bls is very poor , or there is no significant source of ionizing radiation , or both .",
    "additionally , the conviction of a bimodality separating bls and fsrq in terms of their emission line properties had been established .",
    "the situation , though , is far from clear and recent results point toward a continuous transition from bls to fsrqs in terms of their emission line characteristics . even in the complete sample of stickel",
    "1991 ) , the authors identified 6 out of 34 rbls that had emission lines violating the equivalent width limit of @xmath140  .",
    "it is also true that the equivalent width is variable and there are objects that change classification depending on the time of observation ( @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the bl pks 0521365 ( @xcite ) , and the prototype object of this class , bl lacertae ( @xcite ) , have shown emission lines with equivalent widths @xmath141 . more surprisingly , the x - ray selected bl mkn 501 , which has recently been detected at tev energies ( @xcite ) , has shown emission lines in the past ( @xcite ) .",
    "corbett et al .",
    "( 1996 ) argue in the case of bl lacertae that the most plausible way to power the emission lines is through thermal radiation from an accretion disk .",
    "the required thermal radiation power does not alter significantly the total observed flux and the object does not show the `` big blue bump '' component that many radio loud quasars exhibit .    in a recent study of emission - line luminosities for a sample of hpqs and rbls , scarpa & falomo ( 1997 ) find that the line luminosity ranges of hpqs and bls largely overlap , although rbls have smaller equivalent widths . specifically , in figure 10 of their paper they plot the line luminosity in mg ii versus the continuum luminosity for the sources of their sample , as well as the line that corresponds to the equivalent width limit @xmath142  .",
    "their results clearly demonstrate that for any given continuum luminosity the corresponding emission line luminosity does not show any gap separating rbls and hpqs . if we were to increase the arbitrary @xmath140  limit then we would accept as bls sources that previously have been classified as hpqs .",
    "similarly , lowering the equivalent width limit would shift objects from the bl to the hpq family .",
    "it therefore seems plausible that the gaseous environment of bls , although poorer than that of the hpqs , may not be qualitatively different .",
    "additional arguments for the presence of ionized gas close to the central engines of bls comes from studies of x - ray and euv absorption features in xbls .",

    "we plot the synchrotron peak apparent luminosity @xmath9 as a function of the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath115 for the xbl ( diamonds ) and rbl ( triangles ) samples of sambruna et al .",
    "the rbls with emission lines that violate the @xmath147 equivalent width criterion are marked with small filled circles .",
    "note that these sources are preferentially low @xmath0 , high @xmath9 objects .",
    "we use the scaling relation ( [ eq : scale ] ) , coupled with the accelerating jet model to show that the lack of emission lines in high @xmath0 , low @xmath9 ( bl15bl17 ) bls and the existence of emission lines preferentially in low @xmath0 , high @xmath9 ( bl13bl14 ) bls can be reconciled with the existence of a scaled - down accretion disk illuminating a belr .    in figure [ line ]",
    "we plot the sed for a range of @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the belr luminosity is proportional to the jet electron kinetic luminosity , and for the purpose of demonstration we consider a broad line with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 3000 km / s and with power @xmath148 .",
    "the belr luminosity is shown by the short horizontal line centered at @xmath149 hz .",
    "as @xmath2 and @xmath113 decrease , the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath0 increases .",
    "although the decrease of @xmath2 is accompanied by a decrease in the emitted power @xmath6 at every frequency , the shift of @xmath0 toward higher frequencies results in the gradual dominance of the synchrotron emission over the line radiation . in figure [ line2 ]",
    "we plot as filled circles the loci of the model for the range of luminosities used in figure [ line ] .",
    "the qualitative behavior of the model is similar to the trends exhibited by the data : as the model points shift to higher values of @xmath0 and lower values of @xmath9 , the equivalent width @xmath150 decreases , crossing over to values smaller than @xmath147 .",
    "thus , although the ratio of jet electron kinetic luminosity to belr luminosity remains the same , the equivalent width of the emission lines decreases as the electron kinetic luminosity of the source decreases .",
    "this is again a manifestation of the breakdown in self - similarity described in   [ apply ] .",
    "the main points of this work are as follows .",
    "we verify that an increase in the angle @xmath1 between the line of sight and the jet axis shifts the observed characteristics of the source from the rbl to the xbl class . as has been noted , however ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ,",
    "this shift is not enough to explain the range of observed physical parameters in complete bl samples .",
    "we propose a new continuous classification scheme for bls , based on the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath0 of the sed of a source .",
    "this scheme avoids the observationally induced bimodality of the currently used xbl ",
    "rbl , or hbl  lbl schemes , and naturally accommodates the newly discovered ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) intermediate bls . as can be seen in the results of sambruna et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , given the class of a bl , we can infer upper limits to the synchrotron luminosity of the object , the steepness of the spectrum at different frequencies , and the maximum concavity index @xmath88 .",
    "observations suggest that bls may be characterized by a scaled - down accretion disk and belr , similar to those found in fsrqs .",
    "based on recent observational results , we propose a self - similar blazar description , according to which the accretion disk luminosity , the blr luminosity , and the jet kinetic luminosity scale with the square of the scale size of the jet [ expression ( [ eq : scale ] ) ] . this description leaves invariant all the primary physical parameters such as the pressure and particle and energy density at the base of the jet .",
    "we propose the @xmath1@xmath10 scheme unification scheme : the electron kinetic luminosity , together with the orientation of the jet , determines the observed characteristics of a source .",
    "a small range of the physical parameters that describe the jet , together with the @xmath1@xmath10 scheme , can reproduce the range of observed bl synchrotron peak frequencies @xmath0 , which can not be reproduced solely by orientation effects ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the negative evolution of the xbls can be explained naturally in the context of this self - similarity based scenario . if we start with a random sample of sources , as cosmological time passes the electron kinetic luminosity decreases , the peak frequency @xmath0 for each source increases , and the number of sources that would be classified as xbls increases .",
    "we predict that samples of intermediate sources will have a @xmath135 value intermediate between those of xbl and rbl samples , as new results have indicated .",
    "we show that the existence of emission lines preferably in low @xmath0 ( bl13bl14 ) , high @xmath9 sources , and the lack of lines in higher @xmath0 , lower @xmath9 objects , is reproduced under scaling relation ( [ eq : scale ] ) . as both @xmath2 and @xmath113 decrease , @xmath115 shifts toward the frequency of the emission lines and the non  thermal continuum gradually dominates over the emission line luminosity .",
    "our discussion of the @xmath1@xmath10 scheme has been confined to the bls , although there are many indications that a common underlying physical mechanism could describe all blazars . since the luminosity output of fsrqs is dominated in many cases by the @xmath5-ray flux and our simulation does not calculate the inverse compton energy losses , we can not at present apply our model to fsrqs .",
    "the extended radio luminosity distribution of fsrqs is similar to that of fr ii radio galaxies ( @xcite ) , and the jet magnetic field tends to be aligned with the jet axis ( @xcite ) .",
    "bls , on the other hand , have an extended radio luminosity distribution similar to that of fr i radio galaxies ( @xcite ) , and the jet magnetic field tends to be perpendicular to the jet axis ( @xcite ) .",
    "although it may seem as if these differences are enough to separate bls and fsrqs into two distinct families , there are many observational arguments that support the possibility of a continuous distribution of sources that belong to a single , continuous family .",
    "we have already reviewed observations suggesting that a separation of blazars on the basis of the emission line properties may not be justified .",
    "the extended radio power distribution for bls and fsrqs overlap significantly , and the same holds for their parent populations , the fr i and fr ii radio galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a population of fr ii radio galaxies with low - excitation narrow - line spectra , low radio power , and more relaxed radio morphologies ( @xcite ) is indicative of a connection between fr i and fr ii sources .",
    "recent vlbi studies ( @xcite ; kollgaard et al .",
    "1996 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) indicate that the magnetic field orientation does not always follow the previously observed bimodality , and fsrqs with perpendicular and bls with parallel magnetic field are not rare .",
    "additionally , recent results ( @xcite ) from higher frequency ( 43 ghz ) vlbi observations indicate that the magnetic field orientations of both bls and fsrqs in the radio core region are similar",
    ".    there are several bls in the samples that sambruna et al .",
    "( 1996 ) consider which have extended radio characteristics that correspond to fr ii radio galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , or have longitudinal magnetic fields ( @xcite ) .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ bl ] , all these bls are low @xmath0 ( bl13bl14 ) , high @xmath9 objects that occupy a region of the parameter space in the @xmath0@xmath9 diagram similar to that occupied by the fsrq sample .",
    "it therefore seems justifiable to consider that the properties of bls and fsrqs do not correspond to two distinct physical structures , but , rather , form a continuum .    since the jets in these sources are relativistic , the angle that the jet forms with the line of sight must be one of the parameters that affects their observed properties .",
    "the range of observed luminosities for objects with similar synchrotron peak frequencies @xmath0 has led us to propose that a second crucial parameter is the electron kinetic luminosity of the jet .",
    "our simulations show that this formulation indeed holds promise for a global understanding of blazars . for further progress , detailed , time ",
    "dependent simulations that include in an accurate fashion the relevant physical processes , such as inverse compton scattering of both jet synchrotron photons and external photons , need to be developed and compared to observations of individual sources and to the statistical properties of complete samples .",
    "this research was supported in part by the nasa astrophysical theory program grant nag5 - 3839 .",
    "we describe here the analytical one  dimensional steady flow described by blandford & rees ( 1974 ) . the plasma produced in the vicinity of the central engine is ultrarelativistic in the fluid proper frame ( mean total to rest mass ratio per particle @xmath151 , and remains in the ultrarelativistic regime as it flows downstream",
    ". the flow is considered adiabatic and quasi  spherically symmetric , i.e. , that the jet is confined to a cone .",
    "the pressure profile is parameterized by a power law , @xmath152 where the @xmath26 axis is the symmetry axis of the system , @xmath153 is the distance of the flow stagnation point ( bulk motion lorentz factor @xmath154 ) from a fiducial point where the pressure mathematically becomes infinite , @xmath155 is the pressure at @xmath153 , and @xmath103 is the exponent that describes how fast the pressure drops ( @xmath156 ) as we move away from the central engine along the @xmath26 axis .",
    "note that @xmath157 at the fiducial point and not at the central engine .",
    "the jet is characterized by a constant power , @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the jet velocity in units of @xmath160 , @xmath161 is the enthalpy density in the fluid frame and @xmath162 is the cross - section of the jet at a given @xmath26 . for a relativistic gas @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the comoving energy density of the plasma .",
    "one way to ensure that the flow is adiabatic is to assume that a significant portion of the energy is carried by relativistic protons that have essentially no radiative losses .",
    "alternatively , we confine our study to eed with @xmath165 , which corresponds to most of the energy being near the low energy cutoff of the eed . since the low energy electrons have small radiative losses , such a flow is approximately adiabatic .",
    "we use the first description : @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the electron energy density and @xmath168 is the proton energy density in the comoving frame . assuming equipartition between the electron and proton energy density , we set @xmath169 ( the actual requirement is @xmath170 ) .",
    "this ensures that half of the energy is in protons that do not radiate , and therefore our adiabatic approximation is reasonable .",
    "therefore , the electron kinetic luminosity @xmath2 is @xmath171    the cross - section of the jet is minimized at the sonic point ( @xmath15 ) , which is characterized by a pressure @xmath172 a cross - sectional radius @xmath17 @xmath173 and a distance @xmath19 from the fiducial point @xmath174    the cross - sectional radius of the jet as a function of @xmath26 is given by @xmath175 ^{-\\frac{1}{4 } } \\label{eq : radius}\\ ] ] and the bulk lorentz factor of the flow @xmath176 is given by @xmath177 the exponent @xmath18 determines how fast the jet opens and accelerates and is determined solely by the steepness of the external pressure gradient , @xmath178 . for @xmath179 , @xmath180 .",
    "our treatment of electron losses does not consider the thomson losses due to the radiation from an accretion disk .",
    "if @xmath181 is the distance of the fiducial point used in the flow description , the distance of the base of the jet from the central engine is @xmath182 .",
    "the synchrotron losses will be greater than the thomson losses if the accretion disk photon energy density in the comoving frame at the base of the jet is greater than the comoving magnetic field energy density .",
    "as given in dermer & schlickeiser ( 1994 ) , the comoving photon energy density @xmath183 at distance @xmath26 from the central engine due to a point  like accretion disk is @xmath184 where @xmath108 is the accretion disk luminosity , and @xmath185 describe the jet flow at the base of the jet . requiring @xmath186 we obtain @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the accretion disk luminosity in units of @xmath189 erg s@xmath120 . in this work",
    "we assume that the fiducial point is adequately far from the central engine so that relation [ eq : zbase ] is satisfied .",
