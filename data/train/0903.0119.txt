    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are very strong gamma - ray photon emissions from cosmic unpredictable locations in a duration from milliseconds to tens of minutes .",
    "they are the most energetic form of energy released from a single object in such a short time .",
    "the total amount of light emitted in a grb is usually a factor of hundreds brighter than a typical supernova . using thousands of grbs detected by satellite - based detectors",
    ", they have been thoroughly investigated in the kev@xmath4mev energy range .",
    "they are isotropically distributed in the sky with a non - thermal origin . according to the time duration",
    ", grbs are usually classified into long ( @xmath32 s ) and short ( @xmath52 s ) bursts .",
    "since the first detection by the bepposax satellite for grb970228 @xcite , afterglows are observed after grbs are discovered , and this enables the multi - wavelength investigation of grbs from the optical band to x - rays .",
    "redshift measurements show that grbs occur at cosmological distances ( the average redshift of grbs observed by the swift satellite is @xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "some short bursts come from inside old galaxies with little star formation , suggesting that they may be originated from mergers of binary neutron stars or black hole - neutron star systems @xcite .",
    "some long bursts are associated with supernovas and confirmed to be related to deaths of massive stars when central cores collapse to black holes @xcite .",
    "high energy ( he ) gamma - ray emissions from grbs is also observed in several satellite - born experiments .",
    "energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) detected several grbs with photon energies ranging from 100 mev to 18 gev @xcite .",
    "both prompt and delayed emissions were detected and no high energy cutoff was found in the spectra .",
    "most importantly , a distinct he spectral component was evidently detected in grb941017 @xcite .",
    "recently , fermi large area telescope ( lat ) also detected gev emissions from grb080916c @xcite and 081024b @xcite .",
    "these observations at high energies can place important constraints on models of emission processes and on parameters of the environment surrounding the sources of bursts .",
    "very high energy ( vhe ) emission up to @xmath2tev is predicted by several models in both prompt and afterglow phases @xcite .",
    "emission at such high energies could result from electron self - synchrotron compton ( ssc ) scattering in either internal or external , forward or reverse shocks .",
    "in such cases , a spectrum with double - peak shape extending into the vhe band is expected .",
    "some models @xcite also predict vhe emission due to decays of secondary @xmath7 mesons in neutron - rich outflows .",
    "observations of vhe emission could play a role in discriminating between these models .",
    "the difficulty is that the absorption of the vhe photons by the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , due to the pair production @xmath8 , causes a substantial reduction of the vhe photon flux .",
    "this sets a high upper limit on the sensitivity of a detector used for grb search in this energy range .",
    "the gamma - ray fluxes from these grbs become too small to be detected from current satellite - based experiments due to their small sensitive areas , so only ground - based experiments have areas large enough for the detection .",
    "search for vhe emission from grbs has been done by many ground - based experiments including extensive air shower arrays and cherenkov telescopes .",
    "no conclusive detection has been made up to now , while some positive indications were reported .",
    "the tibet @xmath9 experiment found an indication of 10 tev emission in a stacked analysis of 57 bursts @xcite .",
    "the milagrito experiment reported evidence of emission above 650 gev from grb970417a with a chance probability of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "evidence of emission above 20 tev from grb920915c was reported about 1 min earlier than the grb trigger time at @xmath11 level by the hegra airobicc array , but the position deviated of about @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the muon detector grand found an excess during grb971110 with a chance probability of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "due to limited field of view ( fov ) , cherenkov telescopes , like magic and hess , can only be operated in follow - up mode and at least 40 s ( usually minutes ) are needed to sway the telescopes to point to the grb .",
    "however , this sets very low upper limits to the photon fluences at energies around hundreds of gev during the afterglow phase @xcite .    with a large fov ( @xmath22 sr ) and high duty cycle ( @xmath390% ) ,",
    "the argo - ybj experiment , using a full coverage detector of resistive plate chambers ( rpcs ) with area @xmath1 , is well suited for grb surveying .",
    "following alarms by satellite - borne observations of grbs , the argo - ybj detector is used to look for emission from them with a threshold of a few hundreds of gev .",
    "no significant excess has been observed yet . in this paper",
    ", we place upper limits on the vhe emission fluences for the grbs inside the fov of the argo - ybj detector .",
    "two models with very different high energy cutoff are used .",
    "the detector performance is investigated using mc simulation . based on this ,",
    "the sensitivity of the argo - ybj detector for grb search at different time durations and incident zenith angles is presented in section 3 .",
    "the processes of the data analysis and the method to search for vhe emission are described in section 4 .",
    "the results are reported and discussed in section 5 .",
    "the argo - ybj experiment , a collaboration among chinese and italian institutions , is designed for vhe @xmath0-astronomy and cosmic ray observations and located in tibet , china at an altitude of @xmath14 a.s.l .",
    "the detector consists of a single layer of rpcs , operated in streamer mode , with a modular configuration .",
    "the basic module is a cluster ( @xmath15 ) , composed of 12 rpcs ( @xmath16 each ) .",
    "the rpcs are equipped with pick - up strips ( @xmath17 ) and the fast - or signal of 8 strips constitutes the logical pixel ( named pad ) for triggering and timing purposes .",
    "hundred and thirty clusters are installed to form a carpet of @xmath18 with an active area of @xmath19 .",
    "this central carpet is surrounded by 23 additional clusters (  guard ring \" ) to improve the core location reconstruction .",
    "the total area of the array is @xmath20 .",
    "more details about the detector and the rpc performance can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the rpc carpet is connected to two independent data acquisition systems , corresponding to the shower and scaler operation modes . with the scaler mode",
    ", each cluster of the argo - ybj detector counts the rate of events that have total number of hits @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 every 0.5 s. using the count rates , grbs in the argo - ybj detector fov ( zenith angle smaller than @xmath25 ) are investigated without direction information @xcite .    in shower mode",
    ", the argo - ybj detector is operated by requiring at least 20 particles within 420 ns on the entire carpet detector .",
    "the high granularity of the apparatus permits a detailed spatial - temporal reconstruction of the shower front .",
    "the temporal information is the arrival time of particles measured by time to digital converters ( tdcs ) with a resolution of approximately 1.8 ns .",
    "this results in an angular resolution of @xmath26 for showers with energy above 10 tev and @xmath27 at approximately 100 gev @xcite . in order to calibrate the 18,360 tdc channels , an off - line method @xcite",
    "is developed using cosmic ray showers .",
    "the calibration precision is 0.4 ns by using 24 h of data and the calibration result is updated every month @xcite .",
    "the central 130 clusters began taking data in june 2006 , and the `` guard ring '' was merged into the daq stream in november 2007 .",
    "the trigger rate is @xmath23600 hz and the average duty cycle is higher than @xmath28 .",
    "the effective area of the argo - ybj experiment for detecting gamma - ray showers is estimated by using a full monte carlo simulation driven by corsika 6.502 @xcite and geant3-based code argo - g @xcite .",
    "five zenith angles ( @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) are chosen in the simulation and the sampling area is @xmath34 around the carpet center .",
    "the threshold multiplicity of hits ( @xmath35 ) which triggers argo - ybj is 20 .",
    "the effective areas for this threshold at the three zenith angles @xmath29 @xmath36 and @xmath33 are shown in fig.@xmath37 .",
    "[ ht ]    in order to avoid strong absorption of vhe photons by the ebl , two models of grb emission with sharp cutoff of their spectra at 100 gev and 1 tev are investigated .",
    "since the multiplicity of hits @xmath35 in an event is related to the shower primary energy , the optimization of the argo - ybj sensitivity can be done by choosing a corresponding cutoff on @xmath35 . as results of the optimization , ranges of @xmath35",
    "are found corresponding to the two @xmath38 models as reported in table 1 . given the ranges of @xmath35 , the corresponding optimal opening angle radii @xmath39 , inside which 70% of the signal events is included , are reported in table 1 .",
    "this result is almost independent of zenith angle . after using the event selection",
    "listed in table 1 , the average effective areas @xmath40 over the energy ranges from 10 gev to 100 gev and from 10 gev to 1 tev with a differential spectral index @xmath42.0 ( this assumption is used in all the following analyses ) are calculated as functions of the zenith angle @xmath41 .",
    "they fit a functional form @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the average effective areas at @xmath45 , with the parameter @xmath46 and @xmath47 for the two energy ranges , respectively ( see fig.@xmath48 ) ; with these functions the average effective areas at any zenith may be obtained . at @xmath49 ,",
    "the effective area of the argo - ybj detector is about @xmath50 above 10 gev if the cutoff energy @xmath38 of the grb spectrum is chosen as 100 gev . on the other hand ,",
    "it is @xmath51 if @xmath38 = 1000 gev .",
    "[ ht ]    [ ht ]    .@xmath35 ranges and corresponding angular window sizes for gamma rays . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : a ]    it is known that grb spectra can be well fitted with a band function with a break at energy @xmath52 mostly between 100 kev and 1 mev , and the average index @xmath53 below the break is @xmath2@xmath41 and the average index @xmath54 above the break is @xmath2@xmath42.3 @xcite .",
    "most grbs observed by swift do not have such a clear spectral structure with a break since its effective energy range is often lower than the break energy .",
    "grb060805b was detected by the inter planetary network ( ipn ) from 30 kev to 10 mev and the result of fitting the data with the band function ( @xmath53 = @xmath40.66 , @xmath54 = @xmath42.52 and @xmath55 = 240 kev ) is shown in fig.@xmath56 ( solid line ) .",
    "if this grb spectrum extends to tev energies only following the band function , it will be compatible with the upper limits obtained by argo - ybj .",
    "however , the spectrum might not extend with a simple power law ( @xmath54 = @xmath42.52 ) above 100 mev .",
    "it might turn to @xmath54 = @xmath41.95 like the four bright bursts detected by egret observations @xcite .",
    "if ebl absorption is negligible , the limit found by this work implies that the transition energy should be above 620 mev ( see model 1 in fig.@xmath56 ) .",
    "the other possibility is that if the transition energy is 100 mev for this burst , the source should be farther than z = 0.15 ( see model 2 in fig.@xmath56 ) .",
    "in addition , if the ssc mechanism used by finke et al .",
    "( @xcite ) to interpret the spectrum of grb 940217 also works on grb060805b , the limit found by this work will provide a strong constraint . in conclusion",
    ", we have investigated 26 gamma - ray bursts in the field of view of argo - ybj in about two years in the gev@xmath4tev energy range searching for prompt , delayed or prior emission .",
    "since no significant excess is found , we have set upper limits to fluences for most of those bursts .",
