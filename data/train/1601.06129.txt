    "high performance control of ac drives can be achieved using vector control @xcite , which requires the measurement of the rotor position . for many reasons , mainly for cost reduction and reliability increase ,",
    "mechanical sensorless techniques have attracted the attention of researchers as well as many large manufacturers @xcite .",
    "these techniques consist of sensing the motor currents and voltages , and using them as inputs to an estimation algorithm ( such as the state - observer algorithm ) that estimates the rotor angular speed and/or position .",
    "one limitation of the use of sensorless techniques is the deteriorated performance in some operating conditions : namely the low - speed operation in the case of synchronous machines ( sms ) , and the low - frequency input voltage in the case of induction machines ( ims ) @xcite .",
    "usually , this problem is viewed as a stability problem , and sometimes is treated based on experimental results .",
    "however , the real problem lies in the so - called `` observability conditions '' of the system .    over the past few years ,",

    "concerning the i m , a more general study , that covers a wider region of operating conditions , is done ; the speed is not considered to be constant , which requires the estimation of the resistant torque . concerning the sms ,",
    "the wound - rotor synchronous machine ( wrsm ) is studied , and considered to be the general case of sms ; its model and observability conditions are easily extended to the permanent magnet synchronous machine ( pmsm ) and the synchronous reluctance machine ( syrm ) .",

    "first , the machine model is presented , then its local weak observability is studied . in this study , the speed is not considered to be constant , therefore the resistant torque , which is assumed to vary slowly , should be added to the estimated state vector .",
    "the i m can be modeled as a three - phase stator and a three - phase rotor .",

    "the local observability study requires the evaluation of derivatives up to the 5-@xmath42 order of the output .",

    "it should be noticed that , in practice , observer - based techniques do not usually need information on higher than second order derivatives .    symbolic math software is used te evaluate complex expressions .",

    "the expression evokes in the following two particular situations ( to ensure the local weak observability of the system ) :",
    "* @xmath60 : for constant rotor speed , the rotor fluxes should be neither constant ( or slowly varying ) nor linearly dependent , i.e. @xmath61 , for all constant k. * @xmath62 : if the rotor fluxes are slowly varying ( constant ) , which usually corresponds to low - frequency input voltages , the speed has to vary ( rapidly ) .",
    "the i m is locally weakly observable if the determinant @xmath59 is different from zero , this means : @xmath63 knowing that ( figure [ im_vector ] ) : @xmath64 the condition becomes : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the angular frequency of the rotating magnetic field .",
    "the relationship tells that if the rotor speed @xmath28 is slowly varying , the input voltage frequency should not be very low .",
    "nevertheless , in a wide range of applications , the rotor speed is ( almost ) constant during the most of machine operation time , the main conclusion to ensure the i m local weak observability is that the input voltage frequency should not be very low .",
    "an sm is a three - phase machine , having the same stator structure as the i m . depending on the rotor structure ,",
    "there exist three main sm sub - families ( figures [ sm ] , [ pmsm ] , and [ syrm ] ) : wound - rotor ( wrsm ) , permanent - magnet ( pmsm ) and reluctance type syrm synchronous machines .",
    "both wrsm and pmsm can be either salient type ( non cylindrical ) rotor or non - salient type ( cylindrical ) rotor .",
    "interior pmsm ( ipmsm ) is a salient machine , surface - mounted pmsm ( spmsm ) is a non - salient machine . in this section ,",

    ".4     .4     .4       the other sms can be seen as special cases of the salient - type wrsm ; the ipmsm ( figure [ ipmsm_schema ] ) model can be derived by considering the rotor magnetic flux to be constant : @xmath82 and by substituting @xmath83 by the permanent magnet flux @xmath84 : @xmath85    the syrm ( figure [ syrm_schema ] ) model can be derived from the ipmsm model by considering the rotor magnetic flux @xmath84 to be zero : @xmath86    the equations of the non - salient wrsm ( figure [ nswrsm_schema ] ) and spmsm ( figure [ spmsm_schema ] ) are the same as the salient wrsm and ipmsm respectively , except that the stator self - inductances are constant and independent of the rotor position , that is : @xmath87      the system is a 5-@xmath42 order system .",
    "its observability study requires the evaluation of the output derivatives up to the 4-@xmath42 order . in this study , only the first order derivatives are calculated , higher order ones are very difficult to calculate and to deal with .",
    "this gives the following `` partial '' observability matrix : @xmath88   \\label{obsv_matrix}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is an @xmath90 zero matrix .",
    "@xmath91 and @xmath92 denote , respectively , the first and second partial derivatives of @xmath77 with respect to @xmath76 .    it is sufficient to have five linearly independent lines of matrix to insure the local observability of the system .",
    "the first five lines , which come from the first derivatives of @xmath93 and @xmath94 , are studied .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that these currents are available for measurement in all synchronous machines , the rotor current ( that gives the sixth line of matrix ) does not exist for pmsm and syrm .",
    "another reason comes from the physics of the machine : @xmath95 is a dc signal , whereas both @xmath93 and @xmath94 are ac signals , so it is more convenient for physical interpretation to take them together .",
    "symbolic math software is used to calculate the determinant .",
    "currents and fluxes are expressed in the rotor ( @xmath67 ) reference frame ( using the park transformation ) in order to make the interpretation easier .",

    "non - salient wrsm , ipmsm and syrm can be also observable at standstill .",
    "however , the observability of spmsm at standstill can not be guaranteed .",
    "the observability condition @xmath109 implies : @xmath110 the above equation can be written as : @xmath111 then @xmath112 the following approximation can be adopted and currents are non - zero .",
    "in addition , this assumption is an equality for the pmsm ansd the syrm . ] : @xmath113    thus , the wrsm observability condition can be formulated as : @xmath114 it can be seen that the above equation describes a vector , which will be called the _",
    "observability vector _ and denoted @xmath115 ( figure [ sm_vector ] ) , that has the following components in the @xmath67 reference frame : @xmath116 the condition becomes : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the phase of the vector @xmath115 in the @xmath67 reference frame .",
    "finally , the following sms local weak observability condition can be stated : the observability of an sm is guaranteed if the rotational velocity of the observability vector with respect to the rotor is different from the electrical velocity of the rotor with respect to the stator .",
    "therefore , at standstill , the observability vector should rotate and not be fixed .",
    "the local weak observability of motion - sensorless three - phase electrical drives has been studied through this paper .",
    "the study shows that the observability might not be guaranteed in some operating conditions : such as low - frequency rotor fluxes for the induction machines , and standstill operation for the synchronous machines .",
    "the concept of _ observability vector _ generalizes the observability conditions for synchronous machines : this vector should rotate whith respect to the rotor with a speed different from the electrical speed of the rotor with respect to the stator , to ensure the observability .    having the expressions , , , and , it seems to be interesting to combine high - frequency signal injection techniques with observer - based sensorless techniques . in other words ,",
    "high - frequency voltages can be injected in the stator ( or the rotor in the case of wrsm ) windings , in order to guarantee the machine observability in the critical operating conditions , which improves the observer s behaviour . concerning the spmsm , the only way to insure its observability",
