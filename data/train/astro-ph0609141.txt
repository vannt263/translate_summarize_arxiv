    "nearly all stars are believed to form with primordial accretion disks , but it is not clear whether the formation of planets is also a nearly - universal process of stellar evolution . answering this question would help us understand the incidence of planetary systems in the galaxy .",
    "current planet detection techniques , while continuously improving , all suffer from some instrument sensitivity limitation",
    ". many of the planets may very well be insufficiently massive to be detected through gravitational recoil , too faint against the glare of the central star to be imaged directly , too small to significantly reduce the star s measured brightness , or positioned unfavorably along the line of sight to produce a lensing event .",
    "planetary debris disks , however , provide an additional approach .",
    "debris disks contain micron - sized dust grains predominantly produced in collisions between larger - sized bodies ( such as rocks ) .",
    "these dust grains are heated by the parent star and re - radiate at longer wavelengths .",
    "a key facet of debris disks is that the dust grains must be short - lived compared to the age of the system given the efficiency of typical loss mechanisms like poynting - robertson drag and radiation pressure ( with timescales of 10@xmath5 to 10@xmath6 years ) .",
    "the dust must therefore be regenerated either through a continuous collisional cascade or through stochastic collisions .",
    "therefore , the presence of dust implies the existence of larger bodies that can collide and produce dusty debris @xcite .",
    "the largest of these bodies could be meter - sized up to planet - sized , and we may well refer to them generally as planetesimals .",
    "_ therefore , any system with excess thermal emission implies planet formation at least to the extent of forming planetesimals . _",
    "the ability to measure thermal emission in the mid - infrared is therefore a powerful technique in identifying systems in which planetary system formation has occurred or is occurring .",
    "however , since debris disks are cool , optically and geometrically thin , and gas - poor , they are generally harder to detect than the primordial , optically - thick accretion disks found around very young stars ( @xmath710myr ) .",
    "the _ spitzer _ space telescope s unprecedented sensitivity in the mid - infrared allows for the first time a statistical study of debris disks and their evolution across a wide spectral range .",
    "excesses detected at 24@xmath0 generally imply temperatures on the order of 100k .",
    "this equilibrium temperature is achieved in the vicinity of 1 - 5au for spectral types fgk and 5 - 30au for the more luminous b and a stars . by probing these distances in the mid - infrared ,",
    "we are therefore studying potential planet - forming and planet - bearing regions around other stars . building on earlier work from the _ infrared astronomy satellite _ ( iras ) and _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) which showed that the amount of dust in debris disks steadily declines over time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite showed that more than half of a - type stars younger than @xmath130myr have mid - infrared excess .",
    "this result implies that planetary system formation occurs frequently around stars a few times more massive than the sun .",
    "however , the same result also shows that up to @xmath150@xmath4 of the youngest stars have small or nonexistent excesses in the mid - infrared , pointing to a possible range of planetesimal formation and clearing timescales .",
    "can we expect similar behavior for lower - mass , longer - living , solar - like stars ?",
    "both _ iras _ and _ iso _ were in general not sufficiently sensitive to detect the photospheric emission from lower - mass stars . only with _",
    "spitzer _ have mid - infrared surveys of lower - mass stars begun @xcite .",
    "these studies conducted at 24 and/or 70@xmath0 have shown that debris disks exist around solar - like stars at a wide range of possible distances ( @xmath11 - 50au ) and temperatures ( @xmath110 - 650k ) with an age - dependent frequency .",
    "it is one of the goals of this investigation to constrain this age - dependence",
    ". continued surveys of stars with known ages at mid - infrared wavelengths will bring us nearer to understanding how debris disks evolve and ultimately will provide constraints on planet formation time scales .    in this investigation",
    "we use the 24@xmath0 channel on _ spitzer _ to study the incidence of debris disks in the open cluster ic2391 .",
    "ic2391 is estimated to be 50@xmath85myr old @xcite , an age consistent with both theoretical @xcite and observational @xcite timescales of terrestrial planet formation .",
    "it is believed to be of intermediate size with @xmath1100 - 200 members . at a distance of 154pc @xcite ,",
    "the cluster is amongst the closest and best studied .",
    "furthermore , its proximity allows for the detection of photospheric emission at mid - infrared wavelengths from low - mass stars . with little observed 24@xmath0 cirrus structure and visible extinction ( _ _ e(b - v)__=0.006@xmath80.005 ; *",
    "* ) , ic2391 offers an attractive combination of age , distance , and background in which to study debris disks .",
    "the aim of this investigation is to measure the incidence of debris disks found around @xmath150myr stars across a broad range of spectral types .",
    "we discuss the ensemble properties of excesses in ic2391 by placing our data in context with other relevant samples . in the process",
    "we begin characterizing the evolution of debris disks around fgk stars , and compare this result to that previously established for more massive a stars .",
    "the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ; * ? ? ? * ) was used to image a 0.97 square degree area ( 0.66@xmath9 @xmath10 1.47@xmath9 ) centered on ic2391 ( ra 08:40:16.8 , dec -53:06:18.9 ; j2000 ) on 9 april 2004 .",
    "the 24@xmath0 observations used the medium scan mode with half - array cross - scan offsets resulting in a total exposure time per pixel of 80s .",
    "the images were processed using the mips instrument team data analysis tool @xcite , which calibrates the data , corrects distortions , and rejects cosmic rays during the coadding and mosaicking of individual frames .",
    "a column - dependent median subtraction routine was applied to remove any residual patterns from the individual images before combining them into the final 24@xmath0 mosaic .",
    "while mips in scan - mode provides simultaneous data from detectors at 24@xmath0 , 70@xmath0 , and 160@xmath0 , this study is based on only the 24@xmath0 channel .",
    "the longer wavelength channels are insensitive to stellar photospheric emissions at the distance of ic2391 and in addition no cluster stars were detected at 70@xmath0 nor 160@xmath0 .",

    "it likely covers a bit less than half of the spatial extent of the entire cluster @xcite .",
    "there is relatively little background cirrus or extended emission in the field of view .",
    "as explained in  3.3 , mips is sensitive to detecting the photospheres of mid - k dwarfs at the distance of ic2391 .",
    "to determine the fraction of @xmath150myr stars possessing 24@xmath0 emission excess , we must match the detected sources in our mosaic to bona fide ic2391 cluster members .",

    "the selection bands are sufficiently broad to take into account photometric , distance , age , binarity , and model uncertainties ; reddening is not a factor here .",
    "however , with the cluster being close to the galactic plane ( b=-6.90 ) , there is no clear separation between the field stars and the location of the cluster isochrones .",
    "we reduce the interloper contamination of our sample by using the combination of photometric and kinematic measurements as listed above . for later - type stars , however , the evolutionary models appear to diverge at _ v - k@xmath21_@xmath224.4 and hence we used the spectroscopically - confirmed mid - m dwarfs from @xcite to define an empirical cluster sequence for later - type members .",
    "only those sources that satisfied all of the criteria were classified as members and are included in the statistics . from the original 505 sources , 26 met all three criteria for membership . as a consistency and completeness check ,",
    "we compared our list to probable cluster members from the literature lying in the mips field of view in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "while there have been many cluster membership investigations of ic2391 measuring proper motions , optical and near - infrared photometry , radial velocities , rotational velocities , x - ray emission , spectral classification , and spectral youth diagnostics , there is no single complete listing .",

    "all 26 sources from our analysis were also classified in the literature as probable or possible cluster members with all but two ( id7 and 11 ) having spectral confirmation .",
    "having satisfied our membership criteria , we are confident that these 26 sources are bona fide ic2391 cluster members and we list them in tables [ tbl-1 ] and [ tbl-2 ] .    in addition , there were seven sources which were originally deselected due to proper motions slightly exceeding our @xmath18 criterion or not measured but are cited as probable cluster members in the literature .",
    "all seven - id8 , 10 , 13 , 21 , 27 , 29 , and 32 - have photometry consistent with membership according to our first two criteria .",
    "id8 ( hd74009 ) is an f3 star whose proper motion we recalculated using additional catalogue points and now satisfies the third criterion . using an 88-yr baseline , we also verified that id8 is part of a 5.5@xmath11 binary whose companion , id7 , is also detected in our 24@xmath0 image .",
    "the companion independently satisfies the first two membership criteria but with large v band uncertainty .",

    "for a broader range in photospheric temperatures ( color ) , results from @xcite show that the _ k@xmath17_-[24 ] photospheric color gradually reddens with cooler effective temperatures until abruptly turning redward for spectral types later than m0 .",

    "k@xmath17_-[24 ] color is a very good diagnostic for mid - infrared excess since for stars earlier than m dwarfs , it is only weakly dependent on stellar temperature with both bands in the rayleigh - jeans regime . using the _ k@xmath17_-[24 ] as a mid - infrared excess diagnostic , however , requires the @xmath28 band to be photospheric .",
    "near - infrared excess is a diagnostic for optically - thick primordial disks probing emission from active accretion at radii @xmath70.1au .",
    "we find no evidence for near - infrared excesses from _ h - k@xmath17 _ colors in our sample .",
    "furthermore , for stars older than 10myr , the inner - most regions of primordial disks have largely dissipated @xcite .",
    "thus we conclude cluster member emission at _",
    "k@xmath26 _ is photospheric and that significant _ k@xmath26_-[24 ] deviations from photospheric values imply the presence of a circumstellar component .",
    "the lack of a large sample of cluster members with no apparent 24@xmath0 excess in ic2391 across a wide spectral type range makes establishing a pure empirical photospheric locus potentially inaccurate .",
    "there are only 16 apparently - non - excess stars with _ v - k@xmath17_@xmath73.0 .",
    "on the other hand , a mid - infrared investigation of the pleiades by @xcite offers a large homogeneous 24@xmath0 stellar sample of similar metallicity and distance as ic 2391 with only slightly older age .",
    "@xcite have identified 57 pleiades members with good quality detections at _ k@xmath17 _ and 24@xmath0 and no evidence of mid - infrared excess .",
    "we plot these 57 stars with colors 0.05@xmath29_v - k@xmath26_@xmath293.0 in figure [ fig4 ] to illustrate the relative tightness of the distribution .",
    "the age difference between ic2391 and the pleiades will have negligible effect on the intrinsic _ k@xmath17_-[24 ] color with both wavelengths on the rayleigh - jeans side of the emission spectrum for the range of stars in which we are interested .",
    "the effect on the _ v - k@xmath26 _ color is less than 0.1mag according to a comparison of @xcite tracks .",
    "this is not surprising as pre - main sequence stars at 50myr are already quite close to the main sequence . as we use the _",
    "k@xmath17_-[24 ] color as the primary diagnostic for mid - infrared excess , a 10% variation in _ v - k@xmath17 _ or less will have very little effect on identifying excesses when using figure [ fig4 ] . hence ,",
    "for the _ k@xmath17_-[24]@xmath10 regime ( 0.05@xmath29_v - k@xmath17_@xmath293.0 ) , we use the larger sample of pleiades members with no apparent mid - infrared excess to construct an empirical photospheric locus of stars on a _ v - k@xmath21 _ vs _ k@xmath17_-[24 ] color - color diagram .",
    "this photospheric locus is applicable for spectral types from late - b to mid - k stars .    to establish the photospheric locus for m dwarfs , we rely on the field m - dwarf survey of @xcite .",
    "we plot their points ( _ small open circles _ ) with matching _",

    "the photospheric colors indeed turn redward with increased slope for stars with _ v - k@xmath26_@xmath223.6 .",
    "we compare this locus with the predicted _ v - k@xmath17 _ colors for 50myr stars @xcite with the spectral type/_k@xmath17_-[24 ] relation from @xcite by a ( _ dashed line _ ) .",
    "since the precision of the 24@xmath0 photometry in the pleiades dataset is very similar to ours , we adopt the pleiades 3@xmath12 relative excess threshold ( @xmath12=0.05mag ) as the criterion for thermal excess in our ic2391 study . a cluster member whose 24@xmath0 flux density exceeds",
    "its predicted photospheric emission at this wavelength by at least 15% is a debris disk candidate .",

    "we now discuss these results , put them in the context of stars in clusters of similar and different ages , and interpret the implications for debris disk evolution .      because of their high temperatures and luminosities , a stars are very efficient at illuminating the dust in debris disks , yet they are not so hot , as are early - b stars , that they excite gaseous disks that might masquerade as debris dust .",
    "consequently , debris systems around a - type stars ( b5-a9 ) have been studied particularly thoroughly .",
    "the largest surveys of this nature are @xcite ( 266 stars ) and @xcite ( 160 stars ) who used both _",
    "spitzer _ and _ iras _ observations to study debris disk frequencies and evolution .",
    "their samples , composed of both cluster members and field objects , range in ages between 5 and 850myr and all the observations at 24 - 25@xmath13 m are sensitive to photospheric levels .",
    "how does the debris disk frequency of a - type stars in ic2391 compare to the larger surveys ? to create a single robust sample to which we could compare our results , we combined the two samples of rieke et al . and su et al . , removed the _ iras _ sources ( which have larger scatter than the _ spitzer _ data ) , used a common relative excess threshold criterion ( @xmath4115@xmath4 ) , and only considered sources with estimated ages @xmath4110myr . whenever there was source duplication we used the more recent su et al",
    "24@xmath0 excess ratio results due to improved reduction procedures and fitting to theoretical photosphere models .",
    "the combined data set consists of 276 stars which we place in arbitrary age bins . for the 31 - 89myr age bin , the excess frequency is 0.44@xmath42 ( 8/18 ) .",
    "thus , nearly half of the stars between 31 - 89myr have evidence for debris disks .",
    "for the same b5-a9 spectral type range in ic2391 , we find an excess frequency of 0.10@xmath43 ( 1/10 ) .",
    "if we use the binomial distribution where the probability of `` success '' is 0.44@xmath42 , the probability that these two results are drawn from the same distribution is about 3% .",
    "there are three possibilities to explain this result : 1 . )",
    "it may be just a statistical deviation , given the only moderate probability that the difference is significant ; 2 . )",
    "it may signal that the simple smooth decay with age used to characterize debris disks as demonstrated by @xcite is an oversimplification ; or 3 . )",
    "it might indicate that the cluster environment has influenced the debris disk evolution .",
    "the first possibility can not be ruled out without observations of additional clusters at similar ages .",
    "nevertheless , the latter two are worth exploring because it is of interest to see whether variations in the debris disk frequencies in clusters might be possible and what their causes might be .    how does this frequency compare to clusters of other ages ? in table [ tbl-4 ] we list the excess frequencies from _",
    "24@xmath0 surveys of a - type stars from open clusters ( and an ob association ) with sample sizes @xmath41 10 and plot them in figure [ fig7 ] . in each cluster , the same relative excess threshold of 15@xmath4 above the predicted photospheric emission has been used .",

    "the seven open clusters and the association closely follow the larger combined field and cluster sample .",
    "this is not unexpected with only the pleiades and ic2391 not already included in the larger combined sample .",

    "that is , there is no evidence in favor of our second hypothesis .",
    "we now consider the third possibility , that the cluster environment might be responsible .",
    "unlike the marginally smaller fraction of measured excesses found amongst the a - type stars in ic2391 , figure [ fig5 ] shows that excesses around the fgk stars appear to be more common .",
    "is there a physical scenario that can explain the behavior of _ both _ stellar types ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , a dependence of the incidence of excesses on metallicity has not been seen in solar analogs @xcite .",
    "a hypothesis invoking mass segregation whereby the most massive stars settle towards the cluster center where stellar densities , and hence disk interactions , are highest does manage to explain why less - massive stars would have higher disk frequencies .",
    "however , theoretical simulations of the effects of primordial disk interactions in clusters the size of ic2391 ( @xmath1100 - 200 members ) during the early period of gas dissipation predict low interaction rates @xcite .",
    "in addition , this phenomenon is not observed in other open clusters which should already have experienced mass segregation ( such as the pleiades and the hyades ) .",
    "interestingly , @xcite , conducting a kinematic survey of proper motion data for eight clusters with ages ranging from 8 to 300myr , found ic2391 to be the _ only _ cluster that showed mass dependence as a function of intrinsic proper motion dispersions . the higher mass stars in ic2391 were measured to have lower velocity dispersions than the lower mass stars suggesting mass segregation .",
    "their results , however , suffer from several observational uncertainties including low proper motion accuracies and incomplete ic2391 cluster membership .",
    "nevertheless , their claim is intriguing .    another possibility centers on the photoevaporation of primordial disks .",
    "this process may be greatly accelerated around very luminous o stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the formation of such a star in a cluster is subject to small number statistics @xcite and it is possible that some clusters would have subjected their members primordial disks to this effect , while others would not . given the short lifetimes of o stars , the direct traces of the star would have disappeared by the age of ic 2391 . to account for the differences between the a - type and fgk stars in this cluster , however , requires that either mass segregation play a key role in timescales short enough to expose the a - type stars and their primordial disks to the uv radiation of o stars _ before _",

    ", although it would be interesting to search for some of the effects we have discussed in other clusters , none of them gives a solid explanation for the behavior of ic2391 .",
    "for the present , we need to assume that the lack of a - type star debris systems may just be due to statistics .",
    "seven cluster members in ic2391 with spectral types f to m show evidence of 24@xmath0 excess .",
    "considering just the spectral types within the completeness limit ( @xmath31k4 ) and a 24@xmath0 relative excess threshold of 15@xmath4 , the excess frequency of fgk stars is 0.31@xmath44 ( 5/16 ) .",
    "in fact , even around solar - type stars ( f5-k7 ) , the excess frequency is @xmath10.31 ( 4/13 ) .",

    "unlike the a - star surveys of @xcite and @xcite , there is to date no comprehensive mid - infrared study in the literature of the fraction of solar - type stars with debris disks over a broad range of ages .",
    "we list the excess frequencies for known _ spitzer _ 24@xmath0 surveys sensitive to photospheric emissions of f , g , and possibly k stars in open clusters ( and an ob association ) in table [ tbl-6 ] .",
    "depending on distance , or target sample , the spectral type corresponding to the 24@xmath0 completeness limit brightness varies in each cluster .",
    "we state any assumptions made in estimating the debris disk frequency of each cluster in appendix b.    the evolution of the excess frequency of fgk stars is shown in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "the ic2391 results fill an age gap in the previous studies between 30 and 100myr .",
    "the relatively large 24@xmath0 excess frequency observed around fgk stars in ic2391 ( @xmath131@xmath4 ) appears consistent for its age with an evolutionary decay model .",
    "there are two important results here : 1 ) the ic2391 result implies that planetesimals around solar - type stars are _ still _ undergoing frequent collisions in terrestrial planet - forming regions at @xmath150myr and 2 ) the fraction of fgk stars with 24@xmath0 excess appears to decay similarly to the trend seen for a - type stars .    while the uncertainties in the excess frequencies of the youngest systems are considerable , figure [ fig8 ] clearly illustrates that planetesimal activity ( collisions ) within the terrestrial planet zones of fgk stars ( @xmath11 - 5au ) is common during at least the first 50myr .",
    "this is consistent with the epoch of terrestrial planet formation in our own solar system @xcite .",

    "the rarity of large impacts in mature systems is consistent with both the models of @xcite and the cratering record of the terrestrial planets @xcite .",
    "we illustrate this further in  4.3 .",
    "combining with the results of @xcite , the debris disk frequency around fgk stars follows a similar excess decay behavior as the more massive a - type stars . despite the overall similarity of behavior",
    ", one could also conclude from figure [ fig8 ] that the fgk decay characteristic time scale appears shorter than that of the a - type stars .",
    "this is possibly , however , a luminosity effect rather than a mass - dependent effect ( since the more luminous a - stars heat up larger annuli of dust to the levels detectable at 24@xmath13 m ) .",
    "until longer - wavelength observations can probe larger distances around fgk stars for evidence of cooler dust , we conclude from figure [ fig8 ] that _ debris disk evolution does not appear to be strongly dependent on stellar mass_.    infrared excesses may originate from cascading collisions among asteroid - sized objects .",
    "however , some systems may be in a quiescent phase and not currently exhibit infrared excesses . in others",
    ", a wave of planet formation may have already passed through the regions probed at 24@xmath0 ( @xmath11 - 5au ) and planetesimal collisions may be occurring undetected at larger distances @xcite .",
    "this implies that the debris disk incidence reported here actually gives a lower limit to the fraction of stars possessing planetestimals or undergoing planetesimal formation .",
    "since a third of the stars have significant planetesimal - collision - generated excess emission at @xmath150myr , and the incidence of debris disks possibly rises at earlier ages , _ it is likely that planetesimals form around the majority of solar - like stars_. however , even a more intriguing conclusion can be drawn if planetesimal collisions must be driven by gravitational perturbations from planet - sized objects , in which case it may be true _ that most primordial disks around solar - like stars evolve to form planetary systems_.      understanding how the 24@xmath0 excess evolves over time around fgk stars may provide insights to the collision history in the terrestrial planet region .",
    "taking luminosity differences into account , we now explore the evolution of the excess ratio , which we defined in  3.3 .",
    "the 24@xmath0 excess ratios of fgk stars in our ic2391 sample range between 0.9 and 2.0 with a median of 1.1 . in figure [ fig12 ]",

    "the upper envelope of the excess ratios appears to decrease rapidly within the first @xmath125myr followed by a gentler decay with characteristic timescale of @xmath1100myr .",

    "while more data at younger ages would better define the fit , the inverse time decay appears to best match the data s upper envelope at ages @xmath2220myr .",

    "@xcite and @xcite conclude that all observed debris disks are in the collision - dominated regime",
    ".    the evolution of the observed excess ratios shown in figure [ fig12 ] may be best interpreted as the evolution of dust generation from planetesimal collisions around fgk stars . as",
    "planetesimals are gravitationally scattered out of planetary systems , grow into moon - sized objects or larger , or are ground down and removed via poynting - robertson drag , their fewer numbers result in less frequent but occasionally powerful collisions producing copious amounts of dust .",
    "observationally , this translates to a decreasing mean 24@xmath0 flux excess ratio with occasional large outliers as shown in figure [ fig12 ] .",
    "potential examples of stars with excess appearing as spikes indicating that such collisions have occured recently ( in the past @xmath1million years ) in their planetary systems are 2m0735 - 1450 ( 80myr , f9 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , hip8920 ( 300myr , g0v ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and hd69830 ( 2gyr , ko ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on the rarity of objects with evidence of recent collisions and the generally low incidence of 24@xmath0 excess we draw a conclusion similar to that of @xcite : _ large collisions occur after the initial period of terrestrial planet formation as episodic , stochastic events_. the general decay in the excess ratio may very well correspond to the decline of the collision frequency within the inner parts of a planetary system analogous to the asteroid belt of our own solar system .",
    "the larger excess ratios observed at earlier periods may be very reminiscent of our understanding of events in the early solar system , in which an early period ( @xmath7100myr ) of frequent and catastrophic collisions ( e.g. , the birth of the moon ) was followed by a declining rate of planetesimal impacts followed by one last brief period of heavy bombardment @xmath1600 - 700 myr @xcite .",
    "the general behavior of the fgk stars in figure [ fig12 ] is remarkably similar to the corresponding figure for a - stars @xcite . besides the inverse - time decay of the excess ratio and episodic outliers at ages older than about a hundred million years , figure [ fig12 ] also illustrates another similarity between the two populations - the fraction of stars that have no or little 24@xmath0 excess at a given age .",
    "this phenomenon occurs even for the youngest fgk stars despite their overall higher probability of having mid - infrared excesses .",
    "analogous to the previous conclusion from a - type star studies @xcite , this possibly points to a distribution of planet formation and clearing timescales even within young stellar clusters .",
    "given the uniform behavior , the range of 24@xmath0 excess measured over time should eventually provide quantitative constraints for theoretical models of planetary system evolution .",
    "the results from numerical simulations investigating the evolution of dust generation from planetesimal collisions around solar - type stars by @xcite show a qualitative similarity to the observed behavior in figure [ fig12 ] .",
    "kenyon & bromley ( see their fig.4 ) show both a steady decline of the 24@xmath0 excess ratio after @xmath11myr due to the depletion of colliding bodies and episodic large increases due to individual massive collisions .",
    "however , there are a number of observed behaviors where the simulations do not yet match .",
    "the characteristic timescales of the simulations appear shorter than what is observed .",
    "for example , at the age of the oldest subgroups in scorpius - centaurus ( @xmath117myr ) , the simulations show 24@xmath0 flux densities only 2 - 3 times photospheric as compared to the much larger ratios observed by @xcite and shown in figure [ fig12 ] .",
    "this difference is independent of possible contamination by remnant primordial ( or transition ) disks in the scorpius - centaurus sample .",
    "in addition , there are no large excess ratios ( spikes ) greater than two after 50myr in the simulation results , unlike those of 2m0735 - 1450 and hip8920 shown in figure [ fig12 ] .",
    "lastly , at no time before a hundred million years in the simulation does the 24@xmath0 excess ratio reach unity .",
    "any theory of debris disk evolution will have to account for those stars that show no 24@xmath0 excess ( within _ spitzer s _ detection limits ) at ages less than 100myr .",
    "this is an important observed phenomenon discussed earlier that occurs in stars across a broad range of spectral types and ages .",
    "why some stars , in particular the youngest ( @xmath730myr ) , have mid - infrared excesses and others do not is still without clear explanation .    additional mid - infrared observations of intermediate - mass stars with known ages should help further constrain the time scales and behavior of the evolution of debris disks and , ultimately , of planetary system formation .",
    "we have conducted a photometric survey for dusty debris disks in the @xmath150myr open cluster ic2391 with the mips 24@xmath0 channel on _",
    "spitzer_. this wavelength probes regions @xmath15 to 30au around a - type stars and regions @xmath11 to 5au around fgk stars . due to the cluster s proximity",

    "however , it is possible that this difference simply reflects random statistical variations .    in comparison",
    ", 31@xmath3 of the fgk stars in ic2391 have excesses . from their behavior , we find the following :    1 .",
    "a high level of planetesimal activity ( collisions ) is still occurring in terrestrial planet regions ( @xmath11 - 5au ) at @xmath150myr .",
    "2 .   the fraction of fgk stars with 24@xmath0 excesses decreases significantly on timescales of @xmath1100myr .",

    "the decay and variation of 24@xmath0 excess ratios around fgk stars is very similar to that measured around a - type stars . despite an overall decaying excess ratio evolution , there are large fractions of young stars with no excess at the youngest ages and rare large excesses at older ages indicative of episodic and stochastic events .",
    "4 .   despite differences in luminosity and in the annuli probed at 24@xmath0 between a - type and fgk stars , debris disk evolution",
