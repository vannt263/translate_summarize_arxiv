    "fiber bundles with statistically distributed thresholds for breakdown of individual fibers provide simple and interesting models of failure processes in materials under stress .",

    "we study here equal - load - sharing models , in which the load previously carried by a failed fiber is shared equally by all the remaining intact fibers in the bundle @xcite .",
    "the break - down thresholds @xmath5 for the individual fibers are assumed to be independent random variables with the same cumulative distribution function @xmath6 and a corresponding probability density @xmath7 : @xmath8    we consider a bundle of @xmath9 fibers , clamped at both ends . at a force @xmath10 per surviving fiber the total force @xmath11 on the bundle",
    "is @xmath10 times the number of intact fibers .",
    "the average , or macroscopic , force is given by the expectation value of this , @xmath12.\\label{load}\\ ] ] one may consider @xmath10 to represent the elongation of the bundle , with the elasticity constant set equal to unity . in the generic case",
    "@xmath13 will have a single maximum @xmath14 , a critical load corresponding to the maximum load the bundle can sustain before complete breakdown of the whole system .",
    "when a fiber ruptures somewhere , the stress on the intact fibers increases .",
    "this may in turn trigger further fiber failures , which can produce avalanches that either lead to a stable situation or to breakdown of the whole bundle .",
    "one may study the burst distribution @xmath15 , defined as the expected number of bursts of size @xmath0 when the bundle is stretched until complete breakdown . when the load on the bundle is increased continuously from zero ,",
    "the generic result is a power law @xmath16 for large @xmath0 , with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , experiments may be performed in a different manner . in sec .",
    "2 we show for the uniform probability distribution of thresholds that for experiments in which the load is increased in finite steps of size @xmath17 rather than by infinitesimal amounts , the power - law exponent is seen to increase to the value @xmath4 .",
    "this have been noticed in a special case previously : an argument by pradhan _",
    "@xcite for uniform threshold distribution suggested this exponent value .    in sec .",
    "3 we show that the same asymptotic power law , @xmath18 holds for a triangular threshold distribution and for a weibull distribution . the result ( [ -3 ] )",
    "is demonstrated by simulations , and we provide analytic derivations to back up the results .",
    "our conclusions are not limited to the distributions used in the simulations ; we give an analytic derivation valid for a _ general _ threshold distribution .",
    "the avalanche distribution does not follow the asymptotic power law ( [ -3 ] ) for small bursts .",
    "however , our analytic formulas do also cover the distribution for bursts of smaller sizes @xmath0 , down to a minimum size .",
    "in the concluding remarks we discuss briefly the results and their range of applicability .",
    "for the uniform distribution of thresholds , @xmath19 here in dimensionless units , the load curve ( [ load ] ) is parabolic , @xmath20 so that the expected critical load equals @xmath21    fig .  1 shows the size distribution of the bursts obtained by simulation on fiber bundles with the uniform threshold distribution ( [ uniform ] ) . in one procedure",
    "the bursts are recorded under a continuous load increase , in the other procedure the load is increased by discrete amounts @xmath17 .",
    "clearly the exponent describing the large - size power laws are different , close to @xmath22 and @xmath4 , respectively .",

    "avalanche size distribution for the uniform threshold distribution ( [ uniform ] ) .",
    "the distribution marked ( a ) is a record of all bursts when the load is increased continuously , while the bursts recorded in ( b ) results from increasing the load in steps of @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( upper curve ) .",
    "the dotted line in ( a ) represents a @xmath25 behavior , and the dotted lines in ( b ) show the theoretical asymptotics ( [ guniform ] ) for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the figure is based on @xmath26 samples with @xmath27 fibers in the bundle .",
    "+ the basic reason for the difference in the power laws is that increasing the external load in steps reduces the fluctuations in the force .",
    "the derivation of the asymptotic size distribution @xmath28 of avalanches , corresponding to load increases by infinitesimal steps , shows the importance of force fluctuations @xcite .",
    "an effective reduction of the fluctuations requires that the size @xmath17 of the load increase is large enough so that a considerable number of fibers break in each step , i.e.  @xmath29 .    with a sufficiently large @xmath17 we may use the macroscopic load equation ( [ load ] ) to determine the number of fibers broken in each step .",
    "the load values are @xmath30 , with @xmath31 taking the values @xmath32 for the uniform threshold distribution . by ( [ loaduniform ] )",
    "the threshold value corresponding to the load @xmath30 is @xmath33 the expected number of fibers broken when the load is increased from @xmath30 to @xmath34 is close to @xmath35 here the minimum number of @xmath0 is @xmath17 , obtained in the first load increase .",
    "the integral over all @xmath31 from @xmath36 to @xmath37 yields a total number @xmath38 of broken fibers , as expected , since the remaining one - half of the fibers burst in one final avalanche .",
    "the number of avalanches of size between @xmath0 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 , is given by the corresponding interval of the counting variable @xmath31 : @xmath41    since @xmath42 we obtain the following distribution of avalanche sizes : @xmath43 for consistency , one may estimate the total number of bursts by integrating @xmath15 from @xmath44 to @xmath45 , with the result @xmath37 , as expected .",
    "1 shows that the theoretical power law ( [ guniform ] ) fits the simulation results perfectly for sufficiently large @xmath0 .",
    "the simulation records also a few bursts of magnitude less than @xmath17 because there is a nonzero probability to have bundles with considerably fewer fibers than the average in a threshold interval",
    ". however , these events will be of no importance for the asymptotic power law in the size distribution . moreover , for a more realistic threshold distribution the situation is different ( see below ) .",
    "fig .  2 avalanche size distribution for ( a ) the triangular distribution ( [ triangular ] ) and ( b ) for the weibull distribution ( [ weibull ] ) . in both cases",
    "the load is increased in steps of @xmath46 .",
    "the figure is based on @xmath26 samples of bundles with @xmath27 fibers .",
    "+ in order to see whether the asymptotic law ( [ -3 ] ) is general , we have performed simulations for two other threshold distributions , the triangular threshold distribution @xmath47 and the weibull distribution with index @xmath48 , @xmath49    in fig .  2 the exponent @xmath4 is clearly present in the triangular distribution case , and less clearly in the weibull distribution case .",
    "therefore we give now an analytic derivation for a general threshold distribution , and apply the result to the two cases for which the simulation results are shown in fig .",
    "the intention is to see if the simulation results can be fitted , not merely with a power law behavior for large avalanche sizes , but over an extended range of @xmath0 .    for a general threshold distribution",
    "@xmath6 a load interval @xmath17 and a threshold interval are connected via the load equation ( [ load ] ) . since @xmath50 $ ] , an increase @xmath17 in the load corresponds to an interval @xmath51}\\label{dx}\\ ] ] of fiber thresholds .",
    "the expected number of fibers broken by this load increase is therefore @xmath52 note that this number diverges at the critical point , i.e.  at the maximum of the load curve , as expected .",
    "we want to determine the number @xmath53 of bursts with magnitudes in the interval @xmath54 .",
    "the number @xmath53 we seek is the number of load steps corresponding to the interval @xmath55 .",
    "since each load step corresponds to the interval ( [ dx ] ) of @xmath10 , the number of load steps corresponding to the interval @xmath55 equals @xmath56}{\\delta}.\\ ] ]    using ( [ n ] ) we have @xmath57\\ ; p'(x)+2p(x)^{2}}{[1-p(x)-xp(x)]^{2}}\\;\\delta.\\ ] ]    thus we obtain @xmath58^{3}}{[1-p(x)]p'(x)+2p(x)^{2}}\\;\\frac{n}{\\delta^{2}}\\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\frac{p(x)^{3}}{[1-p(x)]p'(x)+2p(x)^{2}}\\;\\frac{n\\delta}{n^{3}},\\label{d(n)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using ( [ n ] ) .",
    "here @xmath59 , determined by eq .  (",
    "[ n ] ) . for the uniform threshold distribution expression ( [ d(n ) ] ) coincides with ( [ guniform ] ) .    near criticality the first fraction in the expression ( [ d(n ) ] ) for @xmath15 becomes a constant .",
    "the asymptotic behavior for large @xmath0 is therefore @xmath60 with a nonzero constant @xmath61 we have used that at criticality @xmath62 .",
    "thus the asymptotic power law ( [ -3 ] ) is universal .    for the triangular threshold distribution considered in fig .",
    "2a equations ( [ n ] ) and ( [ d(n ) ] ) yield @xmath63 and @xmath64 . elimination of @xmath10 gives @xmath65 with asymptotic behavior @xmath66 , in agreement with ( [ dasymp ] ) .    for the weibull distribution considered in fig .",
    "2b we obtain @xmath67 this burst distribution must be given on parameter form , the elimination of @xmath10 can not be done explicitly .",
    "the critical point is at @xmath68 and the asymptotics is given by ( [ dasymp ] ) , with @xmath69 .",
    "these theoretical results are also exhibited in fig .",
    "2 . in both cases",
    "the agreement with the theoretical results is very satisfactory .",
    "the @xmath70 power law is seen , but the asymptotics sets in only for very large avalanches , especially for the weibull case . for small - sized avalanches",
    "it is interesting to note the difference between the uniform distribution and the more realistic weibull distribution . in the latter case",
    "the theoretical result ( [ d(n ) ] ) is reasonably accurate also for @xmath71 .",
    "the reason is that for the weibull ( and the triangular ) threshold distribution there are few very weak fibers .",
    "thus a load increase @xmath17 corresponds to a threshold interval that may , in the average description , contain just a few failing fibers . for the uniform distribution on the other hand , a corresponding threshold interval with a number of fibers much less than @xmath17",
    "can only be caused by fluctuations with very low probabilities .",
    "if we let the load increase @xmath17 shrink to zero , we must recover the asymptotic @xmath28 power law valid for continuous load increase .",
    "thus , as function of @xmath17 , there must be a crossover from one behavior to the other .",
    "it is to be expected that for @xmath72 the @xmath28 asymptotics is seen , and when @xmath73 the @xmath74 asymptotics is seen .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the step - wise load increase is a reasonable as well as more practical loading method from the experimental point of view . while performing fracture - failure experiments by applying external load",
    ", one can not ensure that a single fiber ( the weakest one ) fails , whereas increasing the external load by equal steps is an easier and more realistic procedure .",
    "in conclusion we have shown that the magnitude distribution @xmath15 of avalanches generated by simulation for fiber bundles with step - wise increase in the external load , is asymptotically a power law with an exponent essentially equal to @xmath75 .",
    "we have analytically derived this asymptotic power law @xmath76 for a general probability distribution @xmath7 of the individual fiber thresholds , as well as the pre - asymptotic behavior of the avalanche distribution @xmath15 ."
