    "supernova ( sn ) 2011fe in the galaxy m101 ( ngc 5457 ) was discovered by the palomar transient factory ( @xcite ; @xcite ) in images taken on ut 2012 aug 24 and announced later that day @xcite . as the closest and brightest type ia sn since sn 1972e @xcite , and moreover as one which appears to suffer relatively little interstellar extinction",
    ", this event should provide a wealth of information on the nature of thermonuclear supernovae .",
    "we present here photometry of sn 2011fe in the bvri passbands obtained at two sites , starting one day after the discovery and continuing for a span of 179 days .",
    "section 2 describes our observational procedures , our reduction of the raw images , and the methods we used to extract instrumental magnitudes . in section 3 , we explain how the instrumental quantities were transformed to the standard johnson - cousins magnitude scale .",
    "we illustrate the light curves and color curves of sn 2011fe in section 4 , comment briefly on their properties , and discuss extinction along the line of sight . in section 5",
    ", we examine the rich history of distance measurements to m101 in order to choose a representative value with which we then compute absolute magnitudes . using a very large set of visual measurements from the aavso",
    ", we compare the visual and ccd v - band observations in section 6 .",
    "we present our conclusions in section 7 .",
    "this paper contains measurements made at the rit observatory , near rochester , new york , and the michigan state university ( msu ) campus observatory , near east lansing , michigan .",
    "we will describe below the acquisition and reduction of the images into instrumental magnitudes from each site in turn .",
    "the rit observatory is located on the campus of the rochester institute of technology , at longitude 77:39:53 west , latitude + 43:04:33 north , and an elevation of 168 meters above sea level .",
    "the city lights of rochester make the northeastern sky especially bright , which at times affected our measurements of sn 2011fe .",
    "we used a meade lx200 f/10 30-cm telescope and sbig st-8e camera , which features a kodak kaf1600 ccd chip and astronomical filters made to the bessell prescription ; with @xmath8 binning , the plate scale is @xmath9 per pixel . to measure sn 2011fe",
    ", we took a series of 60-second unguided exposures through each filter ; the number of images per filter ranged from 10 , at early times , to 15 or 20 at late times .",
    "we typically discarded a few images in each series due to trailing .",
    "we acquired dark and flatfield images each night , switching from twilight sky flats to dome flats in late october .",
    "the filter wheel often failed to return to its proper location in the r - band , so , when necessary , we shifted the r - band flats by a small amount in one dimension in order to match the r - band target images .",
    "we combined 10 dark images each night to create a master dark frame , and 10 flatfield images in each filter to create a master flatfield frame . after applying the master dark and flatfield images in the usual manner , we examined each cleaned target image by eye .",
    "we discarded trailed and blurry images and measured the fwhm of those remaining .",
    "the xvista @xcite routines stars and phot were used to find stars and to extract their instrumental magnitudes , respectively , using a synthetic aperture with radius slightly larger than the fwhm ( which was typically @xmath10 to @xmath11 ) .",
    "as figure [ fig : chartlabel ] shows , sn 2011fe lies in a region relatively free of light from m101 ( see also supplementary figure 1 of @xcite ) . as a check that simple aperture photometry would yield accurate results , we examined high - resolution hst images of the area , using acs wfc data in the f814w filter originally taken as part of proposal go-9490 ( pi : kuntz ) .",
    "the brightest two sources within a @xmath11 radius of the position of the sn , ra = 14:03:05.733 , dec = + 54:16:25.18 ( j2000 ) @xcite , have apparent magnitudes of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "thus , even when the sn is at its faintest , in our final @xmath14-band measurements , it is more than one hundred times brighter than nearby stars which might contaminate our measurements .    between august and november , 2011 , we measured instrumental magnitudes from each exposure and applied inhomogeneous ensemble photometry @xcite to determine a mean value in each passband .",
    "starting in december , 2011 , the sn grew so faint in the i - band that we combined the good images for each passband using a pixel - by - pixel median procedure , yielding a single image with lower noise levels .",
    "we then extracted instrumental magnitudes from this image in the manner described above . in order to verify that this change in procedure did not cause any systematic shift in the results",
    ", we also measured magnitudes from the individual exposures , reduced them using ensemble photometry , and compared the results to those measured from the median - combined images . as figure",
    "[ fig : indivmedian ] shows , there were no significant systematic differences .",
    "the michigan state university campus observatory lies on the msu campus , at longitude 05:37:56 west , latitude + 42:42:23 north , and an elevation of 273 meters above sea level .",
    "the f/8 60-cm boller and chivens reflector focuses light on an apogee alta u47 camera and its e2v ccd47 - 10 back - illuminated ccd , yielding a plate scale of 0.56 arcseconds per pixel .",
    "filters closely approximate the bessell prescription .",
    "exposure times ranged between 30 and 180 seconds .",
    "we acquired dark , bias , and twilight sky flatfield frames on most nights . on a few nights",
    ", high clouds prevented the taking of twilight sky flatfield exposures , so we used flatfields from the preceding or following nights .",
    "the i - band images show considerable fringing which can not always be removed perfectly .",
    "we extracted instrumental magnitudes for all stars using a synthetic aperture of radius @xmath15 .",
    "in order to transform our instrumental measurements into magnitudes in the standard johnson - cousins bvri system , we used a set of local comparison stars .",
    "the aavso kindly supplied measurements for stars in the field of m101 @xcite based on data from the k35 telescope at sonoita research observatory @xcite .",
    "we list these magnitudes in table [ tab : compstars ] ; note that they are slightly different than the values in the aavso s on - line sequences which appeared in late 2011 .",
    "figure [ fig : chartlabel ] shows the location of the three comparison stars .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the aavso calibration data included many other stars in the region near m101 . in order to check for systematic errors , we compared the aavso data to photoelectric bv measurements in @xcite .",
    "for the five stars listed as a , b , c , d and g in @xcite , which range @xmath16 , we find mean differences of @xmath17 mag in b - band , and @xmath18 mag in v - band .",
    "we conclude that the aavso calibration set suffers from no systematic error in b or v at the level of two percent .",
    "unfortunately , we could not find any independent measurements to check the r and i passbands in a similar manner .    in order to convert the rit measurements to the johnson - cousins system , we analyzed images of the standard field pg1633 + 009 @xcite to determine the coefficients in the transformation equations @xmath19 in the equations above , lower - case symbols represent instrumental magnitudes , upper - case symbols johnson - cousins magnitudes , terms in parentheses the uncertainties in each coefficient , and @xmath20 the zeropoint in each band .",
    "we used stars a , b , and g to determine the zeropoint for each image ( except in a few cases for which g fell outside the image ) .",

    "the first column shows the mean julian date of all the exposures taken during each night . in most cases ,",
    "the span between the first and last exposures was less than @xmath21 days , but on a few nights , clouds interrupted the sequence of observations .",

    "given our estimates of the extinction to sn 2011fe , this small difference is unlikely to be due to our underestimation of the reddening .",
    "in order to compute the peak absolute magnitudes of sn 2011fe , we must remove the effects of extinction and apply the appropriate correction for its distance .",
    "the previous section discusses the extinction to this event , and we now examine the distance to m101 . since the first identification of cepheids in this galaxy 26 years ago @xcite , astronomers have acquired ever deeper and larger collections of measurements . @xcite",

    "further investigation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) confirmed this relationship and spawned several different methods to quantify it .",
    "we adopt the @xmath315 method , which characterizes an event by the change in its b - band luminosity in the 15 days after from maximum light . the light curve of sn 2011fe yields @xmath2 mag , placing it in the middle of the range of values for sne ia .",
    "@xcite compute linear relationships between the @xmath315 and peak absolute magnitudes for a large sample of sne .",
    "if we insert our value of @xmath315 into the equations from their table 3 for host galaxies with small reddening , we derive the absolute magnitudes shown in the rightmost column of table [ tab : absmax ] .",
    "the excellent agreement with the observed values suggests that our choice of distance modulus to m101 may be a good one .",
    "perhaps because it was the brightest sn ia to appear in the sky since 1972 , sn 2011fe was observed intensively by many astronomers .",
    "the aavso received over 900 visual measurements of the event within six months of the explosion .",
    "since it was observed so well with both human eyes and ccds , this star provides an ideal opportunity to compare the two detectors quantitatively .",
    "we acquired visual measurements made by a large set of observers from the aavso ; note that these have not yet been validated .",
    "we removed a small number of obvious outliers , leaving 880 measurements over the range @xmath316 .",
    "for each of our ccd v - band measurements , we estimated a simultaneous visual magnitude by fitting an unweighted low - order polynomial to the visual measurements within @xmath317 days ; due to the decreasing frequency of visual measurements and the less sharply changing light curve at late times , we increased @xmath317 from 5 days to 8 days at jd @xmath318 and again to 30 days at jd @xmath319 .",
    "we then computed the difference between the polynomial and the v - band measurement .",

    "@xcite retrieved photographic films of sn 1937c , which were originally described in @xcite , re - measured them with a photodensitometer , and calibrated the results to the johnson @xmath321-band using a set of local standards .",
    "they compared their results to the visual measurements of sn 1937c made by @xcite and found @xmath322 we plot this relationship in figure [ fig : comparevisual ] using a dotted line .",
    "@xcite discussed the differences between visual measurements of sn 1991 t from the aavso to ccd @xmath321-band measurements made by @xcite .",
    "we have extracted the measurements of @xcite from their figure 2 and compared them to the visual measurements , using the median of all visual measurements within a range of 0.5 days to define a value corresponding to each ccd measurement .",
    "we show these differences as circular symbols in figure [ fig : comparevisual ] ; an unweighted linear fit yields @xmath323    we find the slope to be the more interesting quantity in these relationships , since the constant offset term may depend on the choice of comparison stars for visual observers .",
    "although at first blush the slopes appear to be quite different , if one examines figure [ fig : comparevisual ] carefully , one will see that the trend is quite similar for all three sne if one restricts the color range to @xmath324 .",
    "the main difference between these three events , then , lies in the measurements made when the sne were relatively blue .",
    "could that difference be real ?",
    "we note that sne 1991 t ( definitely ) and 1937c ( probably ) were events with slowly declining light curves and higher than average luminosities , while sn 2011fe declined at an average rate and , for our assumed distance to m101 , was of average luminosity .",
    "as @xcite describes , the spectrum of sn 1991 t was most different from that of ordinary sne ia at early times , before and during its maximum luminosity ; it is also at these early times that sne shine with 1 light .",
    "could the combination of photometry by the human eye and photometry by ccd really distinguish ordinary and superluminous sne ia at early times ?",
    "the evidence is far too weak at this time to support such a conclusion , but we look forward to testing the idea with future events .",
    "@xcite undertook a more general study , comparing the measurements of a set of roughly 20 stars near ss cyg made by many visual observers to the johnson @xmath321 as a function of @xmath299 .",
    "he found a relationship @xmath325 which we plot with a dash - dotted line in figure [ fig : comparevisual ] .",
    "the slope of this relationship is consistent with that derived from the entire sn 2011fe dataset .",
    "our multicolor photometry suggests that sn 2011fe was a `` normal '' type ia sn , with a decline parameter @xmath2 mag . after correcting for extinction and adopting a distance modulus to m101 of @xmath326 mag",
    ", we find absolute magnitudes of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which provide further evidence that this event was `` normal '' in its optical properties .",
    "as such , it should serve as an exemplar of the sne which can act as standard - izable candles for cosmological studies .",
    "a comparison of the visual and ccd @xmath321-band measurements of sn 2011fe reveal systematic differences as a function of color which are similar to those found for other type ia sne and for stars in general .",
    "we acknowledge with thanks the variable star observations from the aavso international database contributed by observers worldwide and used in this research .",
