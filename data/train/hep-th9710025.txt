    "recent studies have unveiled interesting aspects of the scattering of charged particles by a thin magnetic flux tube , the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect @xcite .",
    "such investigations were motivated by some conceptual difficulties in the case of spin zero particles @xcite .",
    "in that situation , it has been shown that accordance between the exact and perturbative calculations can be achieved only after the inclusion in the perturbative method of a contact , delta like interaction .",
    "as remarked in @xcite , the discrepancy between the two results , prior to the addition of the delta interaction , was to be expected since different boundary conditions were adopted . in a field theory context , taking the ab and anyon scatterings in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions as equivalent , the contact interaction may be simulated by a @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the particle s field .",
    "this procedure was employed to reproduce the ab scattering in a direct nonrelativistic approach @xcite and also as the low energy limit of the relativistic theory of a scalar field minimally coupled to a chern ",
    "simons field @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that in the fermionic case the additional auto  interaction is not needed since it is automatically provided by pauli s magnetic term .",
    "these issues have been recently examined @xcite from two different perspectives . in @xcite",
    "we examined the scattering of two low energy spin up fermions , starting from a relativistic quantum field formulation and in @xcite the same amplitude was calculated through a galilean formulation of field theory as described by lvy ",
    "leblond @xcite .",
    "as expected , the amplitudes obtained by both methods were free from ultraviolet divergences , in accord with the above mentioned conjecture for the scattering of two spin up fermions .",
    "nevertheless , our results show differences with respect to the nonrelativistic treatment coming from vacuum polarization , induced magnetic moment and also from the exchange of two `` photons '' . in reference",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , it was also considered the scattering of a spin up and a spin down fermions , with the conclusion that the pauli magnetic interaction cancels and a logarithmic divergence shows up .",
    "motivated by these developments we here extend our study of @xcite to the scattering of a spin up and a spin down fermions starting from a relativistic quantum field formulation . by introducing an intermediary cutoff , we separate the regions of low and high virtual momenta in the feynman integrals .",
    "this allows a direct simplification of the integrands and suggests the identification of the low momentum part with the corresponding galilean amplitude got in @xcite . in our approach , however , the logarithmic divergence is canceled by a contribution coming from the complementary high momentum part , leaving us with a finite result .",
    "we also determine an effective lagrangian which summarizes the low momentum behavior of a system of two relativistic fermions interacting through a cs field .",
    "the lagrangian of the system is @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is a two component dirac field representing particles and anti - particles of spin up ( down ) and the same mass @xmath6 ( the parameter m is to be taken positive )",
    ". we shall be interested in getting the low energy approximation for the scattering amplitude of one particle spin up by another of spin down ( total spin zero ) . for completeness",
    ", we shall also reproduce the corresponding results for the case of two spin up fermions but before anti - symmetrization , as done in @xcite . assuming that in the center of mass frame the incoming and outgoing particles have momenta @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the tree approximation for these processes are respectively @xcite , @xmath13 where the cs field propagator in the coulomb gauge @xcite is given by    @xmath14    with @xmath15 .    after expanding in powers of @xmath16",
    ", we get in leading order ,    @xmath17    where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 stands for @xmath21 . as can be seen in a direct nonrelativistic treatment @xcite , the origin of the constant term in eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) is a contact pauli interaction between the magnetic moment of each fermion with the magnetic field of the other . in the anti - parallel case ,",
    "( [ 6 ] ) , these effects cancel each other and this is the basic reason behind the above mentioned discrepancy for the spin zero scalar case .    before embarking into the discussion of the one loop scattering amplitudes ,",
    "let us comment on the renormalization of the model ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "as in the case of just one fermion field interacting with the cs field , @xcite , the divergences are concentrated into contributions to the vacuum polarization , self energies and vertex parts . the analysis is entirely analogous to that of ref .",
    "now , however , there are two contributions to the cs self energy ,    @xmath22}{[(k+q)^2-m^2](q^2-m^2 ) } + ( m\\rightarrow -m ) , \\ ] ]    and the would be induced cs term vanishes .",
    "therefore @xmath23 is kept unchanged and can be considered as the renormalized cs parameter . for low momentum",
    "we get    @xmath24    implying that the effective low energy lagrangian will contain a maxwell term with intensity twice as big as in the case of just one fermion field .    defining the @xmath4 field self - energy ,",
    "@xmath25 from the propagator @xmath26 , we have    @xmath27    choosing a mass counterterm so that @xmath6 is the physical mass , i. e. , the position of the propagator s pole , we obtain the renormalized result @xmath28.\\label{10a}\\ ] ]    the self  energy of the @xmath5 field is very similar , giving ( @xmath29 ) @xmath30\\label{10}.\\ ] ]    there are two vertex parts to be considered .",
    "the calculation of these vertex parts is greatly simplified if it is restricted to the low momentum region . for the @xmath5 field",
    "up to one loop we have , @xmath31[(p - k)^2 - m^2+i \\epsilon](-{\\vec k}^2)}+ i e \\gamma^\\rho\\ ] ]    so that , in the low momentum regime , @xmath32    the vertex part of the @xmath4 field is similar and one only has to observe the changes due to the different sign of the mass ( see ref .",
    "@xcite )    coupling , alternatively , an external electromagnetic field to the fields @xmath5 and @xmath4 , one could compute quantum corrections to their respective magnetic moments , fig",
    ". 1 . we would like to emphasize that , contrarily to what happens in covariant gauges , in the coulomb gauge it is essential to take into account self energy corrections to obtain the correct result . in particular , for spin down fermions scattered by an effective external field @xmath33 , which already incorporates the polarization of the vacuum , we obtain the scattering amplitude @xmath34    from this expression , one sees that the sole effect of the vertex correction is to modify the fermion magnetic moment which now turns out to be @xmath35 this result must be compared with @xmath36 got in @xcite for the spin up field @xmath4 .",
    "it should be noticed that the induced magnetic moment has the same sign in both cases .",
    "this is in accord with the results for the anomalous spin @xcite .",
    "therefore , the total intensity of the magnetic moment increases for one field and lowers for the other .",
    "we are now ready to pursue our analysis of the scattering of spin 1/2 particles at one loop order .",
    "first of all , self  energy and radiative corrections to the tree approximation , in leading @xmath37 order , give @xmath38 where the first and second terms in the first equality come , respectively , from the vacuum polarization and vertex insertions .",
    "it is easy to verify that the same expression holds for the spin - up / spin - up case ( the difference of this result with respect to the one in @xcite is just because we now have two fields instead of one contributing to the vacuum polarization tensor ) .",
    "the remaining graphs to be analyzed are shown in fig .",
    "2 . the box and crisscross two photon exchange amplitudes , for the total spin zero case , are given by @xmath39   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\bigl [ \\bar u(-\\vec { p}^{\\phantom { x}\\prime})\\gamma^\\alpha s_f(r^\\prime , m )   \\gamma^\\beta u(-\\vec p)\\bigr ] \\delta_{\\nu\\beta}(\\vec k - \\vec p )   \\delta_{\\alpha\\mu}(\\vec k - \\vec p^{\\phantom { x}\\prime})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath40   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\bigl [ \\bar u(-\\vec { p}^{\\phantom { x}\\prime})\\gamma^\\alpha s_f(t , m )   \\gamma^\\beta u(-\\vec p)\\bigr ] \\delta_{\\nu\\alpha}(\\vec k - \\vec p )   \\delta_{\\beta\\mu}(\\vec k - \\vec p^{\\phantom { x}\\prime}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      to simplify the calculation we shall use @xmath44 for the @xmath5 free field propagator .",

    "we separate the integration region into two parts through the introduction of an auxiliary cutoff @xmath58 . in the _ low _ energy part , @xmath59 ,",
    "nonrelativistic approximations are done directly in the integrands . in the complementary _ high _ energy region ,",
    "@xmath60 , we taylor expand the integrands around zero external momenta .",

    "( [ ha1 ] ) , up to an overall phase , agrees with the last formula of @xcite for @xmath71 and @xmath72 , after the identification @xmath73 ) . in our formulation",
    "however the needed counterterm is automatically provided by the contribution from the _ high _ energy part of the above integrals .",
    "in fact , in the nonrelativistic formulation the last term in ( [ 25 ] ) can be effectively interpreted as coming from the counterterm @xmath74 which suggests that a @xmath75 interaction should be considered from the starting in the nonrelativistic model .",
