    "more than four decades ago , dzyaloshinskii @xcite and moriya @xcite showed that the inclusion of spin - orbit coupling into the description of low - symmetry magnetic systems generates an anisotropic exchange interaction , the so - called dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction .    in the early nineties ,",
    "this interaction was discussed intensively in connection with the copper - oxide compounds .",
    "in particular , la@xmath0cuo@xmath2 exhibits a small gap in the spin - wave spectrum and a finite net ferromagnetic moment in each plane due to an out - of - plane canting of the spins .",
    "these features were attributed to dm interactions .",
    "@xcite yildirim _",
    "_ @xcite did a careful microscopic study of this mechanism for tetragonal copper - oxide systems .",
    "in particular , their analysis proved that the orthorhombic distortion present in these materials is irrelevant to the out - of - plane magnetic anisotropy .",
    "moreover , they showed that not only the antisymmetric anisotropic superexchange between two neighboring spins is important but the symmetric one as well .",
    "@xcite    the dm interaction has gained renewed interest in the context of the novel transition - metal oxide nav@xmath0o@xmath1 , which is believed to be a quarter - filled ladder compound in its high - temperature phase .",
    "@xcite at @xmath3 a phase transition , the interpretation of which is still controversial , takes place in this material where charge ordering ( @xmath4 ) occurs simultaneously with the opening of a spin - gap of approximately @xmath5.@xcite a series of recent studies has addressed the nature of the low - temperature state @xcite .    in this context",
    "it is of interest that very recent electron spin resonance ( esr ) experiments @xcite have detected a considerable anisotropy of the absorption intensity with respect to the magnetic field orientation , which has been attributed to the dm interaction .",
    "apart from esr , raman scattering in the presence of a magnetic field is an alternative experiment for the observation of possible effects due to dm interactions .",
    "unfortunately however , at present , the various experimental settings in search for such effects in raman scattering have been unsuccessful for nav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite this may not be conclusive yet , since the raman cross section of the relevant scattering process could be too small to be observable .    in order to shed some light onto this scene",
    ", a microscopic analysis of the magnetic exchange and raman scattering - operator seems highly desirable",
    ". however , apart from early work specific to the copper - oxides superconductors@xcite such analysis is lacking .",
    "therefore , it is the purpose of this paper to present a detailed description of the raman operator for nav@xmath0o@xmath1 . in this context particular emphasis will be given to the role of the dm interaction which by symmetry is allowed in this material .",
    "above the spin - charge transition temperature t@xmath6 nav@xmath0o@xmath1 crystallizes in the centrosymmetric pmmn space group.@xcite the compound consists of vo@xmath1 square pyramids sharing edges in the @xmath7 layer and chains of na located between the @xmath7 layers .",
    "the superexchange interaction between vanadium sites is mediated through the pyramid s base oxygens and the relevant structural element of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 can be thought of consisting of ladders of v - o - v rungs along @xmath8 which are weakly coupled along @xmath9 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "discarding single - ion anisotropy , a general form of any scalar two - spin interaction between consecutive rungs along the @xmath8-direction of the ladder in nav@xmath0o@xmath1 consists of two contributions @xmath10",
    "i.e. the isotropic heisenberg exchange @xmath11 and the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the total spin on rung @xmath15 . the form of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) vector @xmath16 is determined by requiring that the energy of any configuration of spins has to be invariant under the symmetry transformations of the crystal structure . in our case",
    ", crystallography allows for a dm vector along @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 .",
    "note that this vector is defined _ locally _ in each unit cell and is not forbidden by the inversion center of the crystal structure , which lies in between two v - o - v ladders ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    the standard derivation of ( [ hamiltot ] ) for the case of magnetic moments _ localized _ at single ionic sites can be found in the literature @xcite where it is shown that both terms in this hamiltonian can be derived from generalized exchange processes . in the present paper , however , we aim at a microscopic derivation of ( [ hamiltot ] ) for the case of the _ mixed - valence _",
    "system nav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "we start from a three - band hubbard - model for nav@xmath0o@xmath1 in which we retain only the two active @xmath19-orbitals of the v- and the single o(1)-site on each rung . for simplicity",
    "we consider the o(2)-sites on the legs of the ladder to be integrated out , giving rise to an effective v - v hopping @xmath20 along the leg .",

    "the transfer matrix - elements @xmath36 are diagonal in the spin quantum numbers because we have chosen the quantization axis for the spin to be along @xmath17 , i.e. the main crystallographic axis , and finally ( iv ) @xmath37 denotes the hopping of electrons between o(1)-@xmath27 orbitals on two consecutive rungs along @xmath8 .",
    "the spin - dependence of @xmath37 is small and will be discarded in the remainder of this paper .",

    ", @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . the coulomb repulsion @xmath44 leads to the formation of local moments on the rungs and in the following we will study the interaction between these local moments . for simplicity",
    "we consider the case @xmath45 , since we expect that any finite @xmath44 will lead to qualitatively similar results while increasing the complexity of the calculation needlessly.@xcite",
    "as a first step towards the evaluation of the exchange couplings @xmath46 and @xmath47 , we diagonalize the hamiltonian @xmath48 for an isolated rung",
    ". the ground state belongs to the 3-particle subspace .",
    "in addition , for the calculation of the exchange matrix elements , intermediate states in the 2- and 4-particle sector on a rung are required .",
    "details of the derivation of the relevant eigenstates and eigenvalues of this cluster problem are stated explicitly in appendix a. the exchange matrix elements are obtained by considering the process which describes a spin - flip between two consecutive rungs up to second order perturbation theory in @xmath49 , as defined by @xmath50 and @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ ap10 ] ) . in particular , @xmath52 substituting the electronic model - parameters cited in the previous section into eqns.([ap11 ] ) and ( [ ap14 ] ) we obtain @xmath53 which agrees very well with the experimental value @xcite of @xmath54 .",

    "fleury and loudon @xcite have shown that light scattering from a spin system , depending on the polarization geometry of the incoming and outgoing electric fields , can lead to inelastic photon - induced superexchange .",
    "this has established raman scattering as an important probe to obtain information on the local exchange dynamics in magnetic systems complementary to inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) . in the following",
    "we will generalize the early ideas of fleury and loudon to the case of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 clarifying the role of the dm interaction .",
    "in particular we find that in the case of a polarization of both , the incoming and outgoing photon fields parallel to @xmath8 , i.e. along the legs of the ladder , the raman scattering operator @xmath64 can be expressed as @xmath65 where the @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the frequencies of the incoming and outgoing photons .",
    "the microscopic derivation @xmath68 is placed into the appendix .",
    "it is identical to that of the magnetic exchange integral with however the virtual hopping into the intermediate state of the exchange process driven by the coupling of the vector potential @xmath69 to the current operator@xcite , i.e. @xmath49 of ( [ r3 ] ) has to be replaced by @xmath70 with the current operator @xmath71 , @xmath72 \\qquad\\\\   + \\sum_\\alpha\\left [ t_\\sigma   d_{l\\alpha,\\sigma}^\\dagger d_{l+1\\alpha,\\sigma}^{\\phantom{\\dagger } } -t_\\sigma^ *   d_{l+1\\alpha,\\sigma}^\\dagger d_{l\\alpha,\\sigma}^{\\phantom{\\dagger } }             \\right ]    \\big)~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the total magnetic raman scattering amplitude is then given up to second order in @xmath73 by eq .",
    "( [ ap101 ] ) of appendix a. from this , the definition of @xmath74 and @xmath75 is analogous to ( [ j ] ) and ( [ d ] ) @xmath76 note that a magnetic raman process is possible only if @xmath77 induces transitions between different eigenstates of @xmath78 @xcite , i.e. if @xmath79 = ( j_r(\\omega_{in , out } ) d    \\nonumber \\\\ & & -d_r(\\omega_{in , out})j)\\,[h^{(heis)},h^{(dm ) } ] \\ne0 \\label{conmutator}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] > from ( [ commu ] ) we conclude that magnetic raman scattering from nav@xmath0o@xmath1 , if modeled by ( [ r3 ] ) , arises because two conditions are simultaneously satisfied .",
    "first , the existence of a spin - orbit coupling leads to a non - vanishing commutator in ( [ commu ] ) .",
    "second , because the number of available paths for the magnetic and the photon induced exchange is larger than one _ and _ because @xmath80 the factor of @xmath81 is nonzero .",
    "the latter is true despite the formal similarity between the raman scattering amplitude and the magnetic exchange integral , because @xmath68 displays an additional dependence on the photon energies .",
    "more specifically , for a _ single _ exchange path @xmath82 for any value of @xmath83 while for more than one exchange path @xmath81 vanishes only at @xmath84 .",
    "next , we would like to point out that from the two terms , @xmath11 and @xmath12 which make up @xmath68 it is actually @xmath12 which drives the magnetic raman process . up to now",
    "we have only considered anisotropic contributions to @xmath78 to leading order in @xmath62 .",
    "kaplan @xcite and shekhtman _",
    "et al_. @xcite have shown that , in general , the next - order term @xmath85 contributes to the spin hamiltonian with a very specific prefactor : @xmath86 using this it is possible to transform @xmath78 into an equivalent hamiltonian of the plain heisenberg form using the unitary mapping @xmath87 with @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 . expressed in terms of @xmath91",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath92 .",
    "now , we note that higher order terms in @xmath62 will also contribute to the raman operator .",
    "however , following the discussion after ( [ commu ] ) it is obvious that ( [ utraf ] ) will not simultaneously reduce @xmath78 and @xmath68 to a canonical heisenberg form .",
    "therefore , in the new basis , the raman operator takes on the form @xmath93 . the only part of @xmath94 which does not commute with @xmath95 to lowest order in @xmath62 is the dm - interaction , i.e.  @xmath96 .",
    "this completes our derivation of the raman operator for the _ homogeneous _ phase of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 as realized for @xmath97 .",
    "quite generally the preceeding demonstrates that a dm - contribution to the raman operator @xmath68 will occur in multiband systems whenever a dm exchange - interaction is allowed locally . obviously it is tempting to analyse the effects of this form of @xmath98 also on a _",
    "dimerized _ spin - liquid state , as present in nav@xmath0o@xmath1 for @xmath99 and similarly in cugeo@xmath100 for @xmath101 @xcite . to this end",
    "let @xmath68 act on a pure dimer state @xmath102 , where @xmath103 labels nearest - neighbor pairs of spins which are in a relative singlet state @xmath104 - for the case of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 these pairs of spins correspond to pairs of rungs @xmath105 .",
    "one obtains @xmath106 here @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) refers to triplet states on the dimer - bonds . while the 2nd and 3rd term on the rhs .  of ( [ con1 ] ) comprise of the usual total - spin zero , two - magnon excitation",
    ", the first term refers to a single - triplet state of _ only _ @xmath109-direction .",
    "this shows that single - magnon raman - excitations are allowed in the presence of the dm - interaction .",
    "a single - magnon raman line of this type has a clear experimental signature : it should show _ no splitting _ in an external magnetic field parallel to @xmath16 ( here along @xmath109 ) and it should split into _ two _ branches for a field perpendicular to the dm - vector . to our knowledge",
    "this signature has not yet been observed in experiment .",
    "motivated by recent esr experiments @xcite which probe the existence of a dm interaction in nav@xmath0o@xmath1 , we have presented a microscopic study of the possible impact of this interaction on the raman process .",
    "we have derived the raman operator in the homogeneous state of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 and , additionally , have discussed its effect in the dimerized state .    in the dimerized state two raman - modes",
    "have been observed in nav@xmath0o@xmath1 in bb - polarization at 66@xmath110 and 104@xmath110 .",
    "tentatively these modes have been ascribed to magnetic bound states of total - spin zero.@xcite on the other hand , for @xmath99 ins displays two well defined magnon - excitations , the energies of which , if properly zone - folded to zero momentum coincide with the aforementioned two raman modes@xcite . yet ,",
    "raman experiments show no indication of a splitting of these modes in an external magnetic field .",
    "we therefore conclude that the raman - modes should result from a two - magnon processes ( see ( [ hr_dimer ] ) ) .",
    "clear evidence for a dm - vector in nav@xmath0o@xmath1 along the @xmath109-direction has been provided by esr experiments.@xcite while these authors have interpreted there findings in terms of quasi - static charge - fluctuations above @xmath111 , we believe , in view of the results presented here , that such an interpretation of the esr - data is not necessary .",
    "in fact , the esr - experiments can be understood in terms of the local dm - vector present _ also _ in the high - temperature phase .    in conclusion",
    "we have pointed out , that a local dm - vector gives rise to a non - trivial dm - contribution to the magnetic raman - process whenever at least two _ non - equivalent _ exchange paths exist between the two magnetic moments considered .",
    "we have presented an explicit evaluation of this dm - contribution to the raman - operator for the case of the quarter - filled ladder compound nav@xmath0o@xmath1 and we have shown , that one- and two - magnon processes arise naturally within this scenario .",
    "we have obtained estimates for the exchange - coupling constant along the @xmath8-direction in good agreement with experiment .",
    "moreover we have evaluated the spin - orbit coupling constant within our cluster - approach .",
    "finally , we note that evidence for dm - interactions in the two - dimensional dimer - compound srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath100)@xmath0@xcite have been found by esr @xcite and far - infrared spectroscopy@xcite",
