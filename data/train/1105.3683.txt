    "in the @xmath5cdm model of the universe , the growth of large - scale structure occurs hierarchically with the most massive structures , like clusters and superclusters , formed through the accretion of smaller halos which continuously interact and merge , acquiring infalling galaxies along filaments .    historically ,",
    "the major discoveries concerning the impact of hierarchical assembly and thus environment on galaxy evolution come from the studies conducted on clusters . the butcher - oemler effect",
    ", the morphology vs. density relation and the star formation vs. density relation have shown that the properties of galaxies within clusters are strongly correlated with the local environment and evolve with redshift ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in agreement with",
    "the observed trends a presumable scenario is that the clustering process itself would drive the evolution of the galaxy properties and the typical increase of the early - type fraction with decreasing redshift would be due to gas - rich , star - forming disk galaxies which fall into clusters at higher redshift ( z@xmath30.5 - 1 ) and have their gas reservoir depleted by some mechanism that transforms them into red , bulge - dominated and quiescent galaxies at z@xmath30 .    among the numerous mechanisms proposed to deplete the reservoir of gas in late - type galaxies are ram - pressure and/or tidal stripping @xcite , interaction with the cluster potential @xcite and repeated high - velocity encounters (  harassment  ) @xcite .",
    "however , recent results @xcite have focussed on the hypothesis that the anomalous fraction of early - type galaxies in clusters is the consequence of some pre - process which takes place in _ groups _ before galaxies are accreted into the cluster .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the observations of a decline in star formation rate ( sfr ) in the outskirts of clusters , well outside the virial radius @xcite . although @xcite found that the pre - processes in the group environment seem not to produce a large effect ,",
    "it is nevertheless true that the mechanisms like galaxy mergers and strangulation that efficiently act also in groups could play a very important role in the formation of the galaxy populations , as it has been shown by combining high - resolution n - body simulations with semi - analytic models for galaxy evolution @xcite .    compared to clusters galaxy groups are more difficult to detect because they have a lower density with respect to the background galaxy population , but are much more common in the universe . today",
    "over 50 per cent of galaxies are in these systems and span a wide range in local density showing properties which range from cluster - like to field - like @xcite .",
    "for this reason they are thought to be a key environment to investigate galaxy evolution and to provide a clear framework on the nature of the physical galaxy transformation mechanisms .    until recently , the difficulties in obtaining",
    "large , unbiased samples of groups have forced most of the studies to use small samples selected , for example , from the hickson compact group catalogue @xcite , from the cfa redshift survey @xcite , and from x - ray surveys @xcite . only with the advent of large galaxy redshift surveys , such as the two degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the canadian network for observational cosmology redshift survey ( cnoc2 ) ,",
    "has it become possible to generate large group catalogues in the local universe ( e.g. @xcite ) , and at intermediate redshift @xcite .",
    "the methods used to identify galaxy groups depend on several assumptions and there is no unique group - finder algorithm to assign them members .",
    "the most popular is the friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm applied to galaxy redshift surveys , first proposed by @xcite",
    ". other approaches , which strongly depend on the properties of dark matter haloes , can be found in @xcite .",
    "the 2pigg ( 2dfgrs percolation - inferred galaxy group ) catalogue @xcite and the sdss group catalogue @xcite are two of the largest available samples of galaxy groups which use `` realistic '' mock catalogues to calibrate the parameters associated with the group - finder algorithm .",
    "the motivation for another group catalogue and for our work is to provide a new dataset characterized by both high spectroscopic completeness , to define galaxy environment well , with high quality imaging , to investigate galaxy properties such as galaxy morphologies which could not explored in detail in other catalogues .    in this paper",
    "we present the construction and describe the properties of the padova - millennium galaxy and group catalogue ( pm2gc ) , a database of groups and galaxies at low redshift fully provided , easily upgradable and easily to be consulted . the pm2gc redshift range ( 0.03@xmath0z@xmath00.11 )",
    "is similar to wings ( wide - field nearby galaxy - cluster survey ) , a survey of 77 x - ray selected galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the combination of pm2gc and wings allows the study of the properties and the evolution of galaxies in the widest possible range of environments in the local universe and to understand the origin of the observed trends of galaxy properties versus environment and the relation between galaxy star formation histories and the growth history of structures .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "in @xmath62 we present the dataset ( mgcz ) used and give an overview of the survey ; in @xmath63 we provide a description of our approach to identify groups and our group - finder algorithm linking criteria ; in @xmath64 we show the properties of groups and galaxies in the different environments identified ; in @xmath65 we derive the galaxy stellar masses comparing them with sdss - dr7 masses ; in @xmath66 we test the reliability of our group sample comparing it with the 2dfgrs group catalogue ( 2pigg , eke et al .",
    "2004 ) ; in @xmath67 we present the publicly released pm2gc catalogues and finally in @xmath68 we present a summary . throughout the paper we adopt @xmath7 , @xmath8100 , @xmath90.3 and @xmath100.7 . all magnitudes are expressed in the vega system unless otherwise stated .",
    "to build a catalogue that satisfies our requirements of spectroscopic and photometric completeness , we used a set of galaxies derived from the millennium galaxy catalogue ( mgc ) @xcite , a b - band imaging survey , both deep and wide , which provides a high quality , complete representation of the nearby galaxy populations .    a detailed description of the survey strategy",
    ", the photometric and astrometric calibration and the object detection and classification can be found in @xcite . in brief",
    ", the survey extends along an equatorial strip covering an area of @xmath337.5 deg@xmath11 and consists of 144 overlapping fields taken with the wfc four - ccd mosaic on the isaac newton telescope , with a uniform isophotal detection limit of 26.0 mag arcsec@xmath12 .",
    "the catalogue contains about one million of objects reduced by the cambridge astronomy survey unit ( casu ) @xcite and classified using source extractor ( sextractor , @xcite ) .",
    "the entire set of objects , spanning the range 16@xmath1324 , was next divided into two magnitude ranges to better address the division between stars and galaxies : the mgc - bright catalogue , which contains all objects with @xmath1420 mag , and the mgc - faint catalogue which contains the others .    for this paper we selected a sample of galaxies from the mgcz catalogue - a version of the total mgc database available on dvd - that is the spectroscopic extension of mgc - bright .",
    "it was built upon the redshifts provided by the 2dfgrs and the sdss - edr / dr1 , in which the mgc survey region is fully contained , and completed with redshifts taken by the mgc team at the anglo australian telescope using the 2df facility @xcite , as well as redshifts from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) , the 2df qso redshift survey ( 2qz ) , the paul francis quasar survey and of some low surface brightness galaxies . the total spectroscopic completeness of galaxies obtained by mgc team is greater than 96 per cent for @xmath1420 , so we have no need to apply a statistical completeness correction to sample .    at the beginning , we extracted galaxies at 0.03@xmath0z@xmath00.11 ; we chose this redshift range to avoid galaxies too close by whose spectra only sample the central regions , while remaining at sufficiently low redshifts to retain a deep absolute magnitude completeness limit .",
    "absolute b - band magnitudes were obtained k - correcting the observed sextractor ` best ' magnitudes ( magauto , except in crowded region where the isocor magnitude was used instead ) , corrected for galactic extinction .",
    "the k - corrections were taken from @xcite , using the galaxy redshift and the sloan galaxy color provided in the mgcz catalogue ( hereafter , mgc - sdss ) .    to build our catalogues we used only 3210 bright galaxies with a magnitude @xmath15 - 18.7 corresponding to the k - corrected @xmath1620 magnitude at our redshift upper limit . in fig.[f0 ] a plot of absolute magnitude vs. redshift for this sample is shown .",
    "the high spectroscopic completeness to @xmath1420 , coupled with the photometric depth , makes it a complete absolute magnitude - limited sample .",
