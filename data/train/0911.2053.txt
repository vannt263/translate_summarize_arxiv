    "in modern communication systems , interference is one of the fundamental factors that limit performance .",
    "characterizing its capacity region is a long - standing open problem , except for several special cases ( eg . , the strong interference regime @xcite ) .",
    "the largest achievable region to date is reported by han and kobayashi @xcite , and the core of the scheme is a superposition coding strategy .",
    "recent progress has been made on both inner bounds and outer bounds : recently , etkin , tse , and wang characterize the capacity region of the gaussian interference channel to within one bit @xcite by using a superposition coding scheme with a simple power - split configuration and by providing new upper bounds .",
    "the constant - gap - to - optimality result @xcite provides a strong guarantee on the performance of the proposed scheme .",
    "later , motahari and khandani @xcite , shang , kramer , and chen @xcite , and annapureddy and veeravalli @xcite independently improve the bound and characterize the sum capacity in a very weak interference regime and a mixed interference regime .    in the above interference channel",
    "set - up , transmitters or receivers are not allowed to communicate with one another , and each user has to combat interference on its own . in various scenarios , however , nodes are not isolated , and transmitters / receivers can exchange certain amount of information .",
    "cooperation among transmitters / receivers can help mitigate interference by forming distributed mimo systems which provides two kinds of gains : _ degrees - of - freedom _ gain and _ power _ gain .",
    "the rate at which they cooperate , however , is limited , due to physical constraints .",
    "therefore , one of the fundamental questions is , how much _ interference _ can limited _",
    "transmitter / receiver cooperation _ mitigate ?",
    "how much gain can it provide ?    in this paper , we consider a two - user gaussian interference channel with _ conferencing decoders _ to answer this question regarding receiver cooperation .",
    "conferencing among encoders / decoders has been studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "our model is similar to those in @xcite and @xcite but in an interference channel set - up .",
    "the work in @xcite characterizes the capacity region of the compund mac with unidirectional conferencing between decoders . for general set - up",
    ", it provides achievable rates but is not able to establish a constant - gap - to - optimality result .",
    "the work in @xcite considers one - sided gaussian interference channels with unidirectional conferencing between decoders and characterizes the capacity region in strong interference regimes and the asymptotic sum capacity at high @xmath0 .",
    "for general receiver cooperation , works including @xcite and @xcite , investigate cooperation in interference channels with a set - up where the cooperative links are of the same band as the links in the interference channel .",
    "in particular , @xcite characterizes the sum capacity of gaussian interference channels with in - band receiver cooperation to within a constant number of bits . our work , on the other hand ,",
    "is focused on the gaussian interference channel with out - of - band ( orthogonal ) receiver cooperation , and studies its entire capacity region .",
    "we propose a strategy achieving the capacity region universally to within 2 bits per user , regardless of channel parameters .",
    "the two - bit gap is the worst - case gap which can be loose in some regimes , and it is vanishingly small at high @xmath0 when compared to the capacity .",
    "the strategy consists of two parts : ( 1 ) the transmission scheme , describing how transmitters encode their messages , and ( 2 ) the cooperative protocol , describing how receivers exchange information and decode messages . for transmission ,",
    "both transmitters use superposition coding @xcite with the same power - split as in the case without cooperation @xcite . for the cooperative protocol , it is appealing to apply the decode - forward or compress - forward schemes , originally proposed in @xcite for the relay channel , like most works dealing with more complicated networks , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc .",
    "it turns out neither conventional compress - forward nor decode - forward achieves capacity to within a constant number of bits universally for the problem at hand . on the other hand , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    "observe that the conventional compress - forward scheme @xcite may be improved by the destination directly decoding the sender s message instead of requiring to first decode the quantized signal of the relay .",
    "we use such an improved compress - forward scheme as part of our cooperative protocol .",
    "one of the receivers quantizes its received signal at an appropriate distortion , bins the quantization codeword and sends the bin index to the other receiver .",
    "the other receiver then decodes its own information based on its own received signal and the received bin index . after decoding , it bin - and - forwards the decoded common messages back to the former receiver and helps it decode .",
    "we identify two regions regarding the gain from receiver cooperation : linear and saturation regions , as illustrated through a numerical example in fig .",
    "[ fig_coopgainregime ] . in the linear region ,",
    "receiver cooperation is _ efficient _ , in the sense that the growth of user data rate is roughly linear with respect to the capacity of receiver - cooperative links .",
    "the gain in this region is the _ degrees - of - freedom _ gain that distributed mimo systems provide . on the other hand , in the saturation region ,",
    "receiver cooperation is _ inefficient _ in the sense that the growth of user data rate becomes saturated as one increases the rate in receiver - cooperative links .",
    "the gain is the _ power _ gain of at most a constant number of bits , independent of the channel strength .",
    "we will focus on the system performance in the linear region , because not only that in most scenarios the rate at which receivers can cooperate is limited , but also that the gain from cooperation is more significant .        with the constant - gap - to - optimality result",
    ", we find that the fundamental gain from cooperation in the linear region as follows : either _ one cooperation bit buys one more bit _ or _ two cooperation bits buy one more bit _ until saturation , depending on channel parameters . in the symmetric set - up , at high @xmath0 , when @xmath1 is below 50% of @xmath0 in db scale ,",
    "one - bit cooperation per direction buys roughly one - bit gain per user until full receiver cooperation performance is reached , while when @xmath1 is between 67% and 200% of @xmath0 in db scale , one - bit cooperation per direction buys roughly half - bit gain per user . in the weak interference regime , for a given pair of @xmath2 , when the receiver - cooperative link capacity @xmath3 , cooperation among receivers can get a close - to - interference - free ( that is , within a constant number of bits ) performance . in the strong interference regime , in contrast to",
    "that without cooperation , system performance can be boost _ beyond _ interference - free performance , by utilizing receiver - cooperative links not only for interference mitigation but also for forwarding desired information , since the cross link is stronger than the direct link .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_formulation ]",
    ", we introduce the channel model and formulate the problem . in section [ sec_example ] , we provide intuitive discussions about achievability and motivate our two - round strategy . then we give examples to illustrate why it is not a good idea to use cooperative protocols based on conventional compress - forward or decode - forward . in section [ sec_achievable ] , we describe the strategy concretely and derive its achievable rates , and in section [ sec_asymmconstantgap ] we show that the achievable rate region is within 2 bits per user to the outer bounds we provide . in addition , we characterize the capacity region of compound mac with conferencing decoders to within 1 bit , as a by - product . in section",

    "before introducing our main result , we first provide intuitive discussions about achievability and motivate our two - round strategy ( to be described in detail in section [ sec_achievable ] ) from a high - level perspective .",
    "then we give examples to illustrate why cooperative protocols based on conventional compress - forward or decode - forward may not be good for cooperation between receivers to mitigate interference . throughout the discussion in this section",
    ", we will make use of the _ linear deterministic channel _ proposed in @xcite .",
    "first , consider the following symmetric channel : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "set @xmath1 to be 2/3 of @xmath0 in db scale , that is , @xmath59 . set @xmath60 .",
    "the corresponding linear deterministic channel ( ldc ) is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_examples ] .",
    "the bits at the levels of transmitters / receivers can be thought of as chunks of binary expansions of the transmitted / received signals .",
    "note that in this example , one bit in the ldc corresponds to @xmath61 in the gaussian channel .",
    "we begin with the baseline where two receivers are not allowed to cooperate .",
    "the transmitted signals are naturally broken down into two parts : ( 1 ) the common levels , which appear at both receivers , and ( 2 ) the private levels , which only appear at its own receiver .",
    "each transmitter splits its message into common and private parts , which are linearly modulated onto the common and private levels of the signal respectively .",
    "each receiver then decodes both user s common messages and its own private message by solving the linear equations it received .",
    "this is shown to be optimal in the two - user interference channel @xcite . in this example",
    "[ fig_examples].(a ) ) , bits @xmath62 and @xmath63 are common , while @xmath64 and @xmath65 are private .",
    "the sum capacity without cooperation is 4 bits .",
    "since all levels at both receivers are occupied , one can not turn on bits @xmath66 or @xmath67 without causing collisions .    with receiver cooperation , the natural split of transmitted signals",
    "does not change .",
    "this suggests that the encoding procedure and the aim of each decoder remain the same .",
    "each receiver with the help from the other receiver , however , is able to decode more information .",
    "since each user s private message is not of interest to the other receiver , a natural scheme for receiver cooperation is to exchange linear combinations formed by the signals _ above _ the private signal level so that the undesired signal does not pollute the cooperative information . in this example , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_examples].(b ) , with one - bit cooperation in each direction in the ldc , the optimal sum rate is 5 bits , achieved by turning on one more bit @xmath66 .",
    "this causes collisions at the second level at receiver 1 and at the third level at receiver 2 , while they can be resolved with cooperation : receiver 1 sends @xmath68 to receiver 2 , and receiver 2 sends @xmath63 to receiver 1 . now receiver 1 can solve @xmath69 , and receiver 2 can solve @xmath70 .",
    "in fact , the exchanged linear combinations are not unique .",
    "for example , receiver 1 can send @xmath71 and receiver 2 can send @xmath72 , and this again achieves the same rates .",
    "as long as receiver 1 does not send a linear combination containing the private bit @xmath64 and the sent linear combination is linearly independent of the signals at receiver 2 ( and vice versa for the linear combination sent from receiver 2 to receiver 1 ) , the scheme is optimal for this example channel .",
    "the above discussion regarding the scheme in the ldc naturally leads to an implementable one - round scheme in the gaussian channel , where both receivers quantize - and - bin their received signals at their own private signal level .    in the above example",
    ", it is optimal that each receiver sends to the other linear combinations formed by its received signal above its private signal level .",
    "is this optimal in general ?",
    "the answer is no .",
    "consider the following asymmetric example : @xmath73 , @xmath74 is @xmath75 of @xmath76 in db , and @xmath77 is @xmath78 of @xmath76 in db .",
    "@xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the corresponding ldc is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_asymm ] , where one bit in the ldc corresponds to @xmath81 in the gaussian channel .",
    "first consider the same scheme as that in the previous exmaple .",
    "note that if receiver 2 just forwards signals above its private signal level , it can only forward @xmath62 to receiver 1 and achieves @xmath82 up to 2 bits .",
    "on the other hand , if receiver 2 forwards @xmath64 to receiver 1 , which is below user 2 s private signal level , it achieves @xmath83 bits . from this example",
    ", we see that once there are  useful \" information ( which should not be polluted by the receiver s own private bits ) lies _ at or below _ the private signal level ( in this example , the bit @xmath64 ) , the one - round scheme described in the previous example is suboptimal . to extract",
    "the useful information at or below the private signal level , one of the receivers ( in this example , receiver 2 ) can first decode and then form linear combinations using ( decoded ) common messages _",
    "only_.    without loss of generality , however , the above situation that there is useful information for the other receiver lies at or below the private signal level , only happens at one of the two receivers . in other words",
    ", there exists a receiver where no useful information ( for the other receiver ) lies at or below the private signal level .",
    "the reason is the following :    1 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the capacity region is convex , and hence if a scheme can achieve @xmath84 for all @xmath85 , it is optimal .",
    "if @xmath86 , we weigh user 1 s rate more .",
    "since the private bits are cheaper to support in the sense that they do not cause interference at receiver 2 , user 1 should be transmitting at its full private rate , which is equal to the number of levels at or below the private signal level at receiver 1 .",
    "therefore , all levels at or below the private signal level are occupied by user 1 s private bits and there is no useful information at receiver 1 for receiver 2 .",
    "3 .   similarly",
    "if @xmath87 , there is no useful information at receiver 2 for receiver 1 at or below the private signal level .",
    "hence , the following two - round strategy is optimal in the ldc : if @xmath86 , receiver 1 forms a certain number ( no more than the cooperative link capacity ) of linear combinations composed of the signals above its private signal level and sends them to receiver 2 .",
    "after receiver 2 decodes , it forms a certain number of linear combinations composed of the decoded common bits and sends them to receiver 1 . if @xmath87 , the roles of receiver 1 and 2 are exchanged .",
    "note that depending on the operating point in the capacity region , we use different configurations , implying that time - sharing is needed to achieve the full capacity region .    from the above discussion , a natural and implementable two - round strategy for gaussian channels emerges .",
    "for the transmission , we use a superposition gaussian random coding scheme with a simple power - split configuration , as described in @xcite . for the cooperative protocol , one of the receivers quantize - and - bins its received signal at its private signal level and forwards the bin index ; after the other receiver decodes with the helping side information , it bin - and - forwards the decoded common messages back to the first receiver and helps it decode . in section [ sec_asymmconstantgap ]",
    ", we shall prove that this strategy achieves the capacity region universally to within 2 bits per user .",
    "now , suppose the conventional compress - forward assuming joint gaussianity of the received signals is used for receivers to cooperate .",
    "it is a standard approach to evaluate achievable rates of gaussian channels using compress - forward in the literature , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc . from its corresponding ldc ,",
    "however , one can see that the two received signals of the gaussian channel , @xmath88 , are not jointly gaussian .",
    "the reason is that , suppose they are jointly gaussian , the conditional distribution of @xmath89 given @xmath90 should be marginally gaussian . as fig .",
    "[ fig_examples ] suggests , however , conditioning on receiver 1 s signal results in a hole at the second level of receiver 2 s signal , which was occupied by @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , transmitter 2 s common codebook is not dense enough to make the conditional distribution of @xmath89 given @xmath90 marginally gaussian .",
    "the incorrect assumption results in larger quantization distortions , as depicted in fig . [ fig_examples].(c ) .",
    "the information sent from receiver 1 to receiver 2 , @xmath62 , is _ redundant _ , and can not help mitigate interference @xmath66 .",
    "hence , the achievable sum rate is 4 bits ( 3 bits for user 1 and 1 bit for user 2 ) , which is the same as that without cooperation and is one bit smaller than the optimal one .",
    "recall that 1 bit in the ldc corresponds to @xmath61 in the gaussian channel , therefore the performance loss is unbounded as @xmath91 .",
    "the main reason why conventional compress - forward does not work well is that the scheme does not well utilize the dependency between the two received signals .    on the other hand ,",
    "suppose two receivers cooperate based on the decode - forward scheme .",
    "note that there is no gain if we require both common messages to be decoded at one of the receivers at the first stage without cooperation . by symmetry",
    "we can assume that , without loss of generality , each receiver first decodes its own common message and then bin - and - forwards the decoded information to the other receiver .",
    "at the second stage , it then decodes the other user s common message with the help from cooperation and decodes its own private message . in the corresponding ldc",
    ", the common bit @xmath66 can not be decoded at the first stage , and hence the total throughput using this strategy is at most 4 bits , which is again the same as that without cooperation .",
    "the reason why decode - forward is not good for the two receivers to cooperate is that , it is too costly to decode users own common message at the first stage without the help from cooperation .",
    "in this section we describe the two - round strategy and derive its achievable rate region .",
    "the strategy consists of two parts : ( 1 ) the transmission scheme and ( 2 ) the cooperative protocol .",
    "we use a simple superposition coding scheme with gaussian random codebooks . for each transmitter , it splits its own message into common and private ( sub-)messages . each common message is aimed at both receivers , while each private one is aimed at its own receiver . each message is encoded into a gaussian random codeword with certain power . for transmitter @xmath9 ,",
    "the power for its private and common codewords are @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively , for @xmath6 .",
    "as @xcite points out , since the private signal is undesired at the unintended receiver , a reasonable configuration is to make the private interference at or below the noise level so that it does not cause much damage and can still convey additional information in the direct link if it is stronger than the cross link .",
    "when the interference is stronger than the desired signal , simply set the whole message to be common . in a word , for @xmath94 or @xmath95 , @xmath96 if @xmath97 , and @xmath98 otherwise",
    "the cooperative protocol is two - round .",
    "we briefly describe it as follows : for @xmath99 or @xmath95 , at the first round , receiver @xmath17 quantizes its received signal and sends out the bin index ( described in detail below ) . at the second round , receiver @xmath9 receives this side information , decodes its desired messages ( both users common message and its own private message ) with the decoder described in detail below , randomly bins the decoded common messages , and sends the bin indices to receiver @xmath17 .",
    "finally receiver @xmath17 decodes with the help from the receiver - cooperative link .",
    "we call this a two - round strategy @xmath100 , meaning that the processing order is : receiver @xmath17 quantize - and - bins , receiver @xmath9 decode - and - bins , and receiver @xmath17 decodes .",
    "its achievable rate region is denoted by @xmath101 . by time - sharing",
    ", we can obtain achievable rate region @xmath102 , convex hull of the union of two rate regions .",
    "there is a simple way to understand the strategy from an engineering perspective . to achieve @xmath103 for some non - negative @xmath104 ,",
    "the processing configuration can be easily determined : strategy @xmath105 should be used , where @xmath106 and @xmath107 . in a word , the receiver which decodes last is the one we favor most .",
    "this is the high - level intuition we obtained from the discussion in the ldc in section [ sec_example ] .    in the following ,",
    "we describe each component in detail , including quantize - binning , decode - binning , and their corresponding decoders . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider strategy @xmath108 .",
    "_ quantize - binning _ :    upon receiving its signal from the transmitter - receiver link , receiver 2 does not decode messages immediately . instead , serving as a relay , it first quantizes its signal by a pre - generated gaussian quantization codebook with certain distortion , and then sends out a bin index determined by a pre - generated binning function .",
    "how should we set the distortion ?",
    "as discussed in the previous section , note that both its own private signal and the noise it encounters are not of interest to receiver 1 .",
    "therefore , a natural configuration is to set the distortion level equal to _ the maximum of noise power and private signal power level_.    _ decoder at receiver 1 _ :    after retrieving the receiver - cooperative side information , that is , the bin index , receiver 1 decodes two common messages and its own private message , by searching in transmitters codebooks for a codeword triple ( indexed by the two common messages and the user s own private message ) that is jointly typical with its received signal and some quantization point ( codeword ) in the given bin .",
    "if there is no such unique codeword triple , it declares an error .",
    "_ decode - binning _ :    after receiver 1 decodes , it uses two pre - generated binning functions to bin the two common messages and sends out these two bin indices to receiver 2 .",
    "_ decoder at receiver 2 _ :    after receiving these two bin indices , receiver 2 decodes two common messages and its own private message , by searching in transmitters codebooks for a codeword triple that is jointly typical with its received signal and the common messages both lie in the given bins .",
    "[ rm_diffcf ] the action of receiver 2 as a relay is very similar to that of the relay in the conventional compress - forward with gaussian vector quantization .",
    "note that the main difference from the conventional compress - forward with gaussian vector quantization lies in the _ decoding _ procedure ( at receiver 1 ) and the chosen distortion .",
    "in the conventional gaussian compress - forward , the decoder first searches in the bin for one quantization codeword that is jointly typical with its received signal from its own transmitter _",
    "only _ , assuming that the two received signals are jointly gaussian",
    ". this may not be true since a single user may not transmit at the capacity in its own link , which results in  holes \" in signal space . as a consequence",
    ", this scheme may not utilize the dependency of two received signals well and cause larger distortions .",
    "our scheme , on the other hand , utilizes the dependency in a better way by _",
    "jointly _ deciding the quantization codeword and the message triple , consequently allows smaller distortions , and is able to reveal the beneficial side information to the other receiver .",
    "quantize - binning and its corresponding decoding part of our scheme is very similar to _ extended hash - and - forward _ proposed in @xcite , in which it is pointed out that the scheme has no advantage over conventional compress - forward in a single - source single - relay setting . due to the above mentioned issues ,",
    "however , we recognize in our problem where the channel consists of two source - destination pairs and two relays , the scheme has an unbounded advantage over the conventional compress - forward in certain regimes .",
    "this will be made clear in later sections .",
    "the following theorem establish the achievable rates of strategy @xmath108 .",

    ".    for details , see appendix [ app_erroranalysis ] . here",
    "we give some high - level comments on these rate constraints .",
    "first , unlike interference channels without cooperation , here receiver 1 is required to decode @xmath125 correctly so that it can help receiver 2 .",
    "this additional requirement gives the rate constraint on @xmath126 .",
    "second , in the set of constraints at receiver 1 , on the right - hand side they are all minimum of two terms .",
    "the second term corresponds to the case when the receiver - cooperative link is strong enough to convey the quantized @xmath127 correctly .",
    "the first term corresponds to the case when receiver 1 can only figure out a set of candidates of quantized @xmath127 . in section [ sec_example ]",
    "we see that , in the ldc as long as the quantization level is chosen such that no private signals pollute the cooperative information , the cooperation from receiver 2 to 1 is able to gain @xmath128 comparing with the case without cooperation . in the gaussian channel , however , due to the carry - over of real additions and the gaussian vector quantization , there is a rate loss of @xmath129 bits ( which is at most a constant number of bits if we choose the quantization distortion properly ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath113 corresponds to the number of private bits polluting the cooperative linear combinations in the ldc if one does not choose the quantization distortion properly .    finally , in the set of constraints at receiver 2 , since receiver 1",
