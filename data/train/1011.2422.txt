    "the production of multi - hadron final states at high energies is described within qcd as a two - phase process : in the first phase there is some hard scattering ( strong or electroweak ) of the incoming elementary objects like quarks , leptons or gauge bosons .",
    "the produced quarks and gluons ( `` partons '' ) will form jets of partons by gluon bremsstrahlung and quark pair production according to the rules of qcd perturbation theory for a characteristic cut - off scale @xmath5 . in a second phase the partons reinteract and hadrons",
    "are formed which ultimately decay into stable particles .",
    "these processes are not accessible in perturbation theory and particular models are applied for their description .    the simplest and best understood high energy process is @xmath3 annihilation into hadrons .",
    "it is initiated by the process @xmath6 which evolves into two hadronic jets dominantly . in @xmath4 collisions the protons in the primary hard collision act as a collection of partons and in an event triggered for large transverse energy the partons scattered into large angles form sidewise jets while the spectator jets follow the direction of the incoming protons .",
    "the soft particles in this case form the `` underlying event '' and this phenomenon is under intense investigation today . in addition , there is the possibility of multiple independent parton - parton interactions considered important at the highest available energies .",
    "there are also the untriggered `` minimum bias '' events which may result from small angle parton - parton scatterings .",
    "finally , in nucleus nucleus collisions there may occur hard parton parton interactions as in @xmath4 collisions , in addition there are parton reinteractions in the large nucleus , multiple nucleon - nucleon interactions and , with special interest , the new collective phenomena like quark gluon plasma formation .",
    "although very different phenomena appear in the various processes there are some remarkable simplifications for very soft particles with momentum in the limit @xmath7 in all processes .",
    "we consider for inclusive particle distributions the limit for the particle density @xmath8 in this limit the born term in the perturbative expansion dominates and this leads to some universal features for all processes    1 .",
    "inclusive spectra become energy independent 2 .",
    "the relative normalization of spectra in different processes is given by the colour factors relevant for the minimal partonic process .",
    "this holds for qcd partons , but we assume the same is true also for hadrons .    these properties can be understood qualitatively as follows .",
    "a soft gluon is coherently emitted from all final partons .",
    "having a large wavelength it can not resolve any detailed intrinsic jet structure .",
    "it `` sees '' only the total colour charge which is carried by the primary partons , and these are represented by the born term for the minimal partonic process in the perturbative expansion .",
    "we begin by recalling the main tools to derive the inclusive observables for parton jets .",
    "they are obtained analytically in qcd using the concept of evolution equations ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite , some more recent results will be added ) .",
    "let us consider the partons in a jet emerging from a primary parton of energy @xmath9 within the opening angle @xmath10 .",
    "first we consider the global observables like mean multiplicity @xmath11 , factorial moments @xmath12 of the multiplicity distribution which can be derived from a generating function @xmath13 for the jet scale @xmath14 at small angles @xmath10 and the probability @xmath15 for production of @xmath16 particles as @xmath17 in a corresponding way we obtain inclusive distributions @xmath18 , i.e. the number of particles in the interval @xmath19 , and , more generally , inclusive correlation functions @xmath20 from a generating functional which depends on a probing function @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath15 is the probability distribution of momenta @xmath23 .    for this generating function or functional an evolution equation",
    "is derived in the scale @xmath14 which yields , by appropriate differentiation , the equations for the observables like multiplicities and inclusive spectra . in differential form one",
    "finds the coupled equation for quark and gluon jets ( @xmath24 ) @xcite .",
    "they can be considered as extensions of the well known dglap evolution equations towards low particle energies taking into account soft gluon coherence as realized in a probabilistic way by angular ordering @xcite : @xmath25 the evolution variable is taken as @xmath26 with the non - perturbative @xmath27 cut - off @xmath5 ; the argument of the running coupling is @xmath28 .",
    "the evolution equation ( [ zevol ] ) describes the decay of a parton jet @xmath29 at scale @xmath9 into two parton jets @xmath30 at scale @xmath31 and @xmath32 with probability @xmath33 , the so - called dglap splitting functions . the second equation ( [ zinit ] ) represents the initial conditions at threshold ( @xmath34 ) and means that the parton jets start just with the initial parton @xmath29 .",
    "asymptotic solutions can be obtained in the double logarithmic approximation ( dla ) which includes only the dominant contributions from the singularities at small angles and energies in the emission probability . in this approximation the splitting function @xmath35 in ( [ zevol ] ) ; the next to leading single logarithmic terms are included in the modified leading logarithmic approximation ( mlla ) . up to this order the results from eq .",
    "( [ zevol ] ) are complete ; further logarithmic contributions beyond mlla can be calculated , but they are not complete and neglect in particular process dependent large angle emissions .",
    "nevertheless they improve the results considerably as they take into account energy conservation with increasing accuracy . the full solution of eq .",
    "( [ zevol ] ) , corresponding to the summation of all logarithmic orders can be obtained numerically .",
    "alternatively , one may calculate results of the qcd cascade from a monte carlo generator , such as ariadne @xcite , which applies the same @xmath27 cut - off procedure as eq .",
    "( [ zevol ] ) .",
    "so far we have discussed the properties of a jet of partons obtained from perturbation theory using an artificial cut - off at low scales @xmath5 .",
    "the application to multiparticle observables needs an additional assumption about the hadronization process at large distances which is governed by the color - confinement forces not accessible by perturbation theory .",
    "the simplest idea is to treat hadronization as long - distance process , involving only small momentum transfers , and to compare directly the perturbative predictions at the partonic level with the corresponding measurements at the hadronic level .",
    "this can be applied at first to the total cross sections , where at the low energies the resonance structures are represented in an average sense .",
    "the perturbative approach also describes jet production for a given resolution ; here the collection of partons is compared to hadronic jets at the same resolution and kinematics .",
    "this approach has led to spectacular successes and has built up our present confidence in the correctness of qcd as the theory of strong interactions .    in a next step one",
    "may carry on such a dual correspondence further to the level of partons and final hadrons .",
    "this procedure turns out successful for `` infrared and collinear safe '' observables which do not change if a soft particle is added or one particle splits into two collinear particles .",
    "such observables become insensitive to the cut - off @xmath5 for small @xmath5 .",
    "quantities of this type are energy - flows and -correlations as well as global event shapes like thrust etc .",
    "further on , one may compare partons and hadrons for observables which count individual particles , for example , particle multiplicities , inclusive spectra and multiparton correlations .",
    "such observables depend explicitly on the cut - off @xmath5 ( the smaller the cut - off , the larger the particle multiplicity ) .    according to the hypothesis of local parton hadron duality ( lphd )  @xcite the hadron spectra are proportional to the parton spectra where the conversion of partons into hadrons occurs at a low virtuality scale , of the order of hadronic masses , i.e. @xmath36 few hundred mev , independent of the scale of the primary hard process .",
    "while this hypothesis has been suggested originally for single inclusive spectra it can be generalized to more complex situations of the form @xcite @xmath37 where the non - perturbative cut - off @xmath5 and the `` conversion coefficient '' @xmath38 have to be determined by experiment .",
    "the conversion coefficient should be a true constant independent of the hardness of the underlying process .    in a more recent analysis",
    "mean multiplicities and higher multiplicity moments have been calculated both for sub - jets of variable cut - off scale @xmath39 ( `` jet virtuality '' ) and for hadrons with cut - off @xmath5 in @xmath3 annihilation @xcite with the smooth transition from jets to hadrons for @xmath40 . has been applied . ] for jets at fixed cut - off @xmath39 the normalisation is @xmath41 in ( [ lphdeq ] ) .",
    "it turns out that a unified description of jets and hadrons was possible with the common normalization @xmath42 in this case the hadronic cascade has been represented by the partonic cascade in the average with the same multiplicity of partons and hadrons .",
    "so the resonance bumps in the multi - particle spectra are just represented by the corresponding smooth perturbative spectra in the average .",
    "this _ parton - hadron - jet correspondence _ implies that _ a hadron corresponds to a parton jet of resolution @xmath5_.    when comparing differential parton and hadron distributions there can be a mismatch near the soft limit caused by the mass effects ( partons are taken as massless in general ) .",
    "this mismatch can be avoided by a proper choice of energy and momentum variables . in a simple model@xmath43 partons and hadrons",
    "are compared at the same energy ( or transverse mass ) using an effective mass @xmath5 for the hadrons , i.e. @xmath44 then , the corresponding lower limits are @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we should remark that these duality approaches are justified primarly by their phenomenological success and their intrinsic simplicity and not yet by a convincing theoretical derivation from qcd .",
    "in particular they allow compact analytical solutions for the observable quantities in the available approximations to qcd ( dla , mlla  ) , which is not possible for the phenomenological hadronization models of high complexity .",
    "before we derive the soft properties of particle spectra we discuss the mean particle multiplicity in a jet as the most simple example of a global event characteristic . here",
    "the higher orders in the qcd perturbation theory are very important . by differentiation ( [ nbarfq ] ) of the evolution equations of the generating functions ( [ zevol ] ) one",
    "obtaines the evolution equations for the parton multiplicities @xmath47 in quark and gluon jets ( @xmath24 ) @xcite @xmath48   \\label{eveqmult}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with initial conditions @xmath49 which imply there is only one particle in a jet at threshold . starting with this initial condition",
    "one can obtain by iteration of the evolution equation the perturbative expansion .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour can be derived from ( [ eveqmult ] ) using the ansatz @xmath50 where the anomalous dimension @xmath51 has an expansion in @xmath52 @xmath53 and for the ratio of gluon and quark jet multiplicities @xmath54 with qcd colour factors @xmath55 the coefficients @xmath56 and @xmath57 can be derived from the evolution equations . at high energies the leading behaviour in mlla for both quark and gluon jet multiplicities",
    "is given by @xmath58 with the arbitrary constant @xmath59 , and this behaviour describes well the data in @xmath3 annihilation at lep-1 and lep-2 , for review , see @xcite , more recent results have been presented by delphi @xcite and opal @xcite .    [",
    "fig : rgq ]    the important role of higher logarithmic orders can be studied in the behaviour of the multiplicity ratio @xmath60 in ( [ rgq ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic limit @xmath61 acquires large finite energy corrections in nllo @xcite and 2nllo order @xcite @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 , also 3nllo results have been derived @xcite .",
    "results from these approximations @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "1 together with the numerical solution of the mlla evolution equations ( [ eveqmult ] ) obtained in 1998 @xcite , which takes into account all higher order corrections from this equation and fulfils the ( non - perturbative ) boundary condition ( [ initmult ] ) .",
    "all curves are absolute predictions , as the parameter @xmath65 ( and @xmath5 in case of the numerical calculation ) is adjusted from the growth of the total particle multiplicity in the @xmath3 jets .",
    "the slow convergence of this @xmath66 expansion can be seen and there are still considerable effects beyond 3nllo .",
    "the numerical solution is also in close agreement with the mc result at the parton level obtained @xcite from the herwig mc above the jet energy @xmath67 gev ( @xmath68 in @xmath3 annihilation ) and @xmath69 20% larger at @xmath70 gev .",
    "this overall agreement suggests that the effects not included in the mlla evolution equation , such as large angle emission , are small .",
    "these numerical results are also compared in fig .  1 with data from opal @xcite where the data on gluon jets are derived from 3-jet events in @xmath3-annihilation .",
    "note also that a proportionality constant @xmath38 relating partons and hadrons according to lphd drops in the ratio @xmath60 .",
    "the results obtained from delphi @xcite fall slightly below the curve by about 20% at the lowest energies but converge for the higher ones ; the cdf collaboration comparing quark and gluon jets at high @xmath71 in @xmath4 collisions @xcite finds the ratio @xmath60 in the range @xmath72 gev a bit larger , closer to the 3nllo prediction , but with larger errors and therefore still consistent with the lep results .",
    "next , we consider the inclusive distribution @xmath73 of partons in the momentum fraction @xmath74 or @xmath75 within a jet with primary parton energy @xmath9 and opening angle @xmath10 .",
    "the evolution equation for @xmath76 can be obtained by functional differentiation of ( [ zevol ] ) ( for a review , see @xciteb ) . at small @xmath77 ( large @xmath78 )",
    "the angular ordering @xcite of the cascade evolution which takes into account the soft gluon interferences in a probabilistic way plays an important role . for large @xmath77 the equations approach the",
    "well known dglap evolution equations .    for the present discussion",
    "we restrict ourselves to the simplest approximation , the dla with fixed coupling , where only the most singular terms in the splitting functions for @xmath79 and @xmath80 are kept .",
    "then the evolution equation for parton @xmath29 reads @xmath81 this equation can be solved by iteration . for",
    "fixed @xmath82 one obtains the perturbative expansion @xmath83 with the modified bessel function @xmath84 .",
    "the coherent soft gluon emission leads to a depletion of the spectrum at large @xmath78 , also called `` the hump - backed plateau '' . from the inclusive distribution ( [ xidist ] ) one can obtain the double differential distribution in energy and angle by the differentiation over @xmath85 which yields @xmath86 , or , in the original variables @xmath87 here we recognize in the leading term of @xmath88 the well known born term for soft gluon bremsstrahlung as in qed , but with the appropriate qcd colour factors .",
    "one observes that only the born term survives in the soft limit where @xmath89 ; in this limit we find the simple universal properties emphasised in the introduction : the particle density becomes independent of energy @xmath9 and is proportional to the relevant colour factor for the minimal process , that is here the gluon emission from the quark or gluon jet with @xmath90 or @xmath91 respectively .",
    "this result can be generalised to the accuracy of dla with running coupling which is obtained by iterating ( [ devol ] ) accordingly up to @xmath92 which is appropriate for the low momentum region , furthermore results within mlla have been derived as well @xcite .",
    "the above properties in the soft limit remain unaltered .",
    "a comparison of these calculations is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : p - spectra ] where a model dependent kinematic relation as in ( [ partonhadron ] ) is used .",
    "one can see that the data are rather well described by the model which predicts an energy independent particle density in the soft limit @xmath0 .      in order to check the sensitivity to the colour factors in the born term we should study the dependence of the soft limit of momentum spectra in quark and gluon jets . separating quark and gluon jets results in uncertainties increasing with smaller momenta .",
    "therefore an alternative procedure has been suggested @xcite which studies the radiation into a cone perpendicular to the production plane of 3-jet events in annihilation .",
    "one can consider two extreme limits with two jets aligned : + a ) a quark and a gluon jet are parallel and recoil against a quark jet , in this configuration the soft perpendicular radiation can not separate the two parallel jets and the intensity is as in a @xmath93 dipole , proportional to the colour factor @xmath94 ; + b ) the quark and antiquark are parallel and recoil against the gluon , in this case the primary configuration acts like a @xmath95 dipole with colour factor @xmath96 . of course",
    ", in a realistic experiment one can not go to such extreme limits because of the finite width of the jets , but one can measure a certain range of the angles in between the jets which interpolates between the limits .",
    "the soft gluon bremsstrahlung from a `` colour dipole antenna '' ( @xmath93 or @xmath95 ) is given by @xcite    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is the angle between partons @xmath99 and @xmath100 and @xmath101 denotes the soft gluon .",
    "then , for the aligned @xmath93 antenna one obtains @xmath102 .    in a 3-jet event @xmath103 one finds in lowest order @xmath104,\\ ]",
    "] i.e. there are two dipoles between each of the quarks and the gluon of strength @xmath96 and a colour suppressed dipole between the @xmath105 and the @xmath106 . for @xmath107 one",
    "finds @xmath108 like a @xmath93 dipole , and for @xmath109 one obtains @xmath110 like a @xmath111 dipole , as anticipated above .",
    "the radiation perpendicular to the 3-jet plane ( @xmath112 ) normalised to the same radiation in 2-jet events is then given by the simple formula @xmath113 \\label{3jetsoft } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    such a measurement has been carried out by the delphi collaboration @xcite .",
    "the above formulae should apply in the soft limit where the born term of @xmath88 dominates .",
    "the @xmath71 spectra in the cone perpendicular to the 3-jet plane are found all very similar for @xmath114 gev , therefore one can study instead the integrated multiplicity in the respective cones .",
    "one observes first that the multiplicities in the cone is well described by the above formula ( [ 3jetsoft ] ) , the data are accurate enough to even notice the @xmath115 term in ( [ 3jetsoft ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the data for the ratio on the l.h.s . of ( [ 3jetsofta ] ) are found to depend linearly on the function @xmath116 and one obtains from the slope @xmath117 which is well consistent with the expected @xmath118 in qcd .    from these studies of jets in annihilation",
    "we can conclude that the soft particle density indeed follows the prediction of the soft gluon born terms emphasized in the introduction + a ) the spectra become independent of energy for @xmath0 ; + b ) the soft particle density varies with the orientation of the colour antenna as predicted , this implies that the soft particle density in quark and gluon jets becomes proportional to the colour factors @xmath96 and @xmath94 .",
    "this is in strong contrast to the behaviour of global observables like the mean multiplicity , which obtains large higher order corrections from the integral over the perturbative expansion such as ( [ dborn ] ) and the ratio @xmath119 is as low as 1.5 at lep energies instead of 2.25 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in the soft limit",
    "there is no phase space for subsequent emissions , nor for energy momentum conservation effects . with this experience",
    "we now investigate the hadronic collisions .",
    "we discuss here the `` minimum bias '' events , which we consider as non - diffractive events . in order to estimate the very soft particle production we look for the minimal partonic process which could be responsible for the soft gluon bremsstrahlung .",
    "we assume that the relevant process is a semihard @xmath120 scattering of lowest perturbative order where any two partons inside the proton can scatter with one - gluon exchange at small angles .",
    "the exchange of a colour octet gluon at small angle transfers the colour from the colour singlet protons to the two outgoing partonic clusters which are the colour octet sources of soft gluon bremsstrahlung . in the minimal configuration",
    "each proton splits into a quark - diquark pair which scatter by gluon exchange . in large @xmath121 approximation",
    "the process corresponds to two radiating colour triplet antennae responsible for bremsstrahlung from initial and final partons .",
    "it should be added that also more complex partonic processes will end up in the production of two colour octet systems as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "therefore , according to our general rules , we expect the energy independent limiting soft radiation density in @xmath4 collisions @xmath122 for @xmath123 and , furthermore , we expect this density to occur in a fixed ratio to the corresponding density in @xmath3 collisions as ratio of colour octet and colour triplet dipole sources @xmath124 just like the ratio of the spectra in gluon and quark jets discussed in the last section .    this kind of relation ( [ ratio94 ] ) has been suggested by brodsky and gunion already in 1976 @xcite , but relating the integrated multiplicities in the central rapidity region to these colour factors . from our qcd analysis",
    "we find eq .",
    "( [ ratio94 ] ) to be valid only in the soft limit while the ratio of integrated multiplicities is found closer to unity ( see below ) .",
    "similarly , relations of the kind ( [ ratio94 ] ) appear in some early phenomenological models , but again for the integrated densities only , as outlined in @xcite .",
    "our expectation of an energy independent @xmath122 is based on a coherent process .",
    "it would be violated if there were multiple parton - parton interactions ( processes like @xmath125 ) added incoherently .",
    "such processes appear in some models at high energies ( see , for example , pythia @xcite ) and so the measurements at lhc can shed some light onto the contributions from such processes .",
    "we have studied the energy dependence of @xmath122 using the results of fits to the invariant cross sections @xmath126 measured in the energy range @xmath127 gev obtained from the colliders at cern , fermilab and brookhaven and measurements of inelastic cross sections @xmath128 .",
    "the @xmath71 spectra look qualitatively similar to those in fig .",
    "[ fig : p - spectra ] for annihilations converging towards small @xmath71 but falling more steeply at high momentum .",
    "the @xmath71 spectra have been fitted to distributions which at small @xmath71 behave like @xmath129 these fits are good down to the smallest measured @xmath130 gev .",
    "then one finds @xmath131 from extrapolation @xmath1 .",
    "the functional form ( [ invfit ] ) is not analytic at @xmath132 and is therefore theoretically not satisfactory .",
    "this problem is avoided using the `` thermal '' parametrisation in terms of @xmath133 instead of @xmath71 @xmath134 as applied by phobos @xcite in nuclear collisions and a good fit down to the smaller @xmath135 gev has been obtained .",
    "the extrapolated values @xmath122 are smaller by about 25% as compared to the fit ( [ invfit ] ) .",
    "the results from the available published exponential extrapolations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : i0 ] .",
    "one observes a rather flat energy dependence over the two decades in energy with an average @xmath136 gev@xmath137 .",
    "note , that over this energy range the rapidity density @xmath138 would rise by about a factor 2 .",
    "the different extrapolations ( [ invfit ] ) or ( [ invfitth ] ) should not affect the trend of the energy dependence .",
    "for comparison with annihilation it is better to normalise by the non - diffractive cross section which we take as 15% lower than the inelastic one , which yields @xmath139 gev@xmath137 .",
    "then for the thermal fit and non - diffractive ( minimum bias ) events we obtain @xmath140 so far , there is not yet a fit result from lhc to be used for comparison .",
    "next , we also compare this result with the soft limit in annihilation to test our prediction ( [ ratio94 ] ) .",
    "we present two results .",
    "there is a dedicated comparison by the tpc collaboration  @xcite who compared their own data on annihilation with @xmath4 data from the british scandinavian collaboration @xcite on the @xmath71 spectra of the invariant density .",
    "the tpc data are presented as function of @xmath71 as determined from the sphericity jet axis . in the average over @xmath71",
    "both data sets for pions , kaons and protons are similar .",
    "a closer look , however , reveals , that the spectra fall more steeply with @xmath71 in the @xmath4 collisions and there is a cross over of the spectra at low @xmath71 . the appropriate extrapolation down to @xmath71 near zero yields a larger density for @xmath4 collisions by a factor @xmath141 depending on the kind of fit .",
    "most other experiments present fits to the spectra in particle energy @xmath9 ( not @xmath71 ) . using the fit results from various experiments in the range @xmath142 gev yields @xmath143 gev@xmath137 or the ratio @xmath144 where the first ( preferred ) number refers to the thermal and the second to the exponential extrapolation .",
    "this result is consistent with our qcd based expectation for this ratio @xmath145 .",
    "for the nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath146 ) cross sections we may consider two limiting cases in the relation to the @xmath4 cross section .    \\1 . in case of a point like interaction the particle densities in nuclear collisions are obtained by rescaling the densities in @xmath4 collisions by @xmath147 , the number of nucleon - nucleon collisions , or , `` the nuclear modification factor '' @xmath148 is unity .",
    "the number @xmath147 can be obtained from the glauber model .",
    "\\2 . in case of soft particle production",
    "we expect that such particles with a large wave length @xmath149 are coherently emitted over a range @xmath60 ( from a nucleon @xmath150 or a nucleus @xmath151 mev ) , which results in a reduced rate .",
    "indeed , the inspection of the rhic data @xcite shows the ratio @xmath152 falling below unity for small @xmath71 .",
    "an alternative way presenting data in the soft region is the normalisation to the number of `` participating nucleons '' @xmath153 this concept has been introduced already in 1976 by bialas , bleszynski and czyz @xcite , who found the number of participating nucleons , called there `` wounded nucleons '' as relevant scaling factor for soft production ( @xmath154 ) , i.e. each interacting nucleon should be counted only once and the rescatterings of the same nucleon be disregarded .",
    "again we consider the energy dependence and the normalization of the particle production at central rapidity in the limit @xmath1 .",
    "a detailed study for various centralities ( from peripheral to central @xmath146 collisions ) by phobos @xcite shows that the inclusive @xmath71 spectra in normalisation ( [ rab ] ) or ( [ rabpart ] ) approach about the same densities at 200 and at 62.4 gev .",
    "this implies that the energy dependence is the same for nuclei and protons , i.e. there is no sizable energy dependence .    concerning the normalisation ,",
    "the same data @xcite show that the quantity ( [ rabpart ] ) approaches unity for all centralities ( within about 30% ) at the lower limit of @xmath155 mev .",
    "the star collaboration @xcite has measured this quantity with high precision down to 500 mev and an extrapolation to the `` participant scaling '' for @xmath132 is indicated .",
    "we combined fits of phobos low @xmath71 and star auau data at 200 gev using the thermal parametrisation and also the star @xmath4 data which yields the result @xmath156 which agrees with the calculated @xmath157 , and is therefore consistent with @xmath158 this density for @xmath159 collisions is about six times smaller than expected for an incoherent superposition of collisions with @xmath160 , where this number is obtained from glauber model calculations .",
    "it is remarkable , that the `` wounded nucleon '' model works to the precision of about 10% , the accuracy of measurements and theoretical calculations .",
    "note that this agreement is obtained only in the limit @xmath1 as can be seen from the star data @xcite ; already for @xmath161 gev the deviation from `` participant scaling '' amounts to about 50% .    how can this scaling result be understood ?",
    "an incoming nucleon scatters successively at a number of nucleons in the nucleus ( see fig . [",
    "fig : aa ] b , c for representative diagrams of @xmath162 scattering ) .",
    "the successive gluon exchanges yield again an outgoing colour octet state as in @xmath4 scattering , such that the rescatterings of the nucleon are not causing any production of additional particles .",
    "this happens if in the low @xmath71 interaction only a quark and the diquark appear as active partons , so that also a multi - gluon exchange can not produce a higher colour multiplet than an octet .- integrated rapidity distributions .",
    "] alternatively , one can think of a larger number of exchanged gluons but taking into account that the colour octet exchange gives the dominant leading logarithmic contribution both in dglap and bfkl kinematics .",
    "then , from both viewpoints , each scattered nucleon produces dominantly a colour octet flow as in @xmath4 interactions , in agreement with the phenomenological result ( [ raapart ] ) .",
    "@xmath163    finally , we may ask , whether the universal production of the soft particles from gluon bremsstrahlung also reflects in their composition as detected by particle ratios .",
    "such a universality can be expected if the source of the bremsstrahlung are the colour triplet dipoles generated in @xmath4 and @xmath146 collisions by gluon exchange . in that case not only hadronic collisions but also annihilations have universal dipole sources .",
    "a similarity of particle ratios @xmath164 and @xmath165 in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 reactions at @xmath166 gev has been indeed noted already some time ago by the tpc collaboration @xcite . in this measurement",
    "the transverse momentum @xmath71 for the particle collisions was defined with respect to the sphericity axis .",
    "the @xmath71 dependence of the particle ratios for several hadronic collisions have been compared by phenix @xcite . while at the large @xmath167 gev the ratios @xmath168 and @xmath164 tend to approach large values @xmath169 in the central @xmath159 collisions , these ratios are reduced for non - central and minimum bias @xmath4 collisions .",
    "remarkably , these ratios converge for all the different processes towards lower @xmath170 gev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] we collect data in the low @xmath71 region on the ratio @xmath171 from the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath146 interactions .",
    "as one can see , these particle ratios , indeed , approach each other towards low @xmath172  gev pointing towards a dominance of multiple @xmath93 dipole radiation in all processes .",
    "we note some universal features of the particle production in the limit @xmath173 which we derive from the dominance of coherent qcd gluon bremsstrahlung in this limit .",
    "we consider the particle density @xmath174 in this limit for which we predict    \\1 ) the energy independence , and    \\2 ) the dependence on colour factors according to the minimal partonic process ( born - term ) :    \\a ) annihilation : @xmath175 ;    \\b ) @xmath4 scattering : @xmath176 ;    \\c ) @xmath146 scattering : @xmath177 .",
    "these expectations are well met by the data . in consequence ,",
    "the soft particles do not follow a universal thermal behaviour independent of the initial state .",
    "there is also some universality in the particle ratios which tend to converge to those from @xmath93 dipoles .",
    "soft hadrons in the central region are produced first . in @xmath146 collisions",
    "these slow particles stay behind and do not participate in the equilibration",
    ".    it will be interesting to study the soft limit at lhc energies .",
    "if there are new incoherent sources , as expected in some models with multiple interactions , the soft density @xmath174 could start rising with energy .",
