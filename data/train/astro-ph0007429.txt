    "the circular polarization ( cp ) of radio emission observed from pulsars ( manchester , taylor & huguenin 1975 ; radhakrishnan & rankin 1990 ; han et al  1999 ) and from some quasars ( roberts et al  1975 , weiler & de pater 1983 ; saikia & salter 1988 ) is not understood . in both cases",
    ", simple theory suggests that any polarization should be linear , determined by the direction of the projection of the magnetic field in the source region on the plane of the sky . in both cases ,",
    "intrinsic cp is expected as a correction to first order in an expansion in the inverse of the lorentz factor of the radiating particles , but it does not seem possible to account for the observations in terms of cp intrinsic to the emission process ( radhakrishnan & rankin 1990 ; radhakrishnan 1992 ; saikia & salter 1988 ) .",
    "another possibility is that the cp is imposed as a propagation effect due to the partial conversion of linear polarization into cp resulting from the ellipticity of the natural modes of the medium ( sazonov 1969 ; pacholczyk 1973 ; jones & odell 1977a , b ) .",
    "however , this also fails to provide a satisfactory explanation for the properties of the observed cp . in this paper",
    "we describe a different propagation effect that can lead to cp for a source , independent of its degree of linear polarization .",
    "we refer to this as scintillation - induced cp .",
    "although the observed cps from pulsars and quasars are quite different , we suggest that both might be due to scintillation - induced cp , with the most obvious differences being due to pulsars scintillating in the diffractive regime and quasars scintillating in the refractive regime .    in the formal theory of scattering in a turbulent , magnetized plasma ( melrose 1993a , b ) there are differences in the scattering in the two oppositely circularly polarized wave modes of the medium due to their different refractive indices .",
    "most of the terms contributing to the cp are too small to be of interest for scattering in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "however , we have recently shown ( macquart and melrose 2000 ; hereinafter paper  i ) that there is one much larger contribution to the cp that is a possible candidate for explaining the cp in pulsars and quasars .",
    "the cp identified in paper  i is due to a nonzero variance in stokes @xmath0 , and the formal theory implies that the dominant contribution is of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a phase structure function associated with the relative phase , @xmath3 , between the components in the opposite cps .",
    "the distance @xmath4 is the refractive scale , which is defined in terms of the fresnel scale @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the distance between the scattering screen and the observer s plane and @xmath7 is the wavelength , and the diffractive scale @xmath8 , which is defined by writing the phase structure function in the forms @xmath9 for a power - law spectrum of turbulence .",
    "our purposes in this paper are threefold : first , to provide a physical explanation for the mechanism that leads to this term , second , to use this interpretation to relax some of the restrictive assumptions made in paper  i to obtain a more general semiquantitative expression for the predicted cp , and , third , to explore the suggested application to the observed cp in pulsars and extragalactic sources .",
    "we start ( section  2 ) by including birefringence in a simple model for strong scattering in which scattering is attributed to a large number of coherent patches of size @xmath10 within an envelope of size @xmath11 on the scattering screen ( e.g. , goodman & narayan 1989 , narayan 1992 , gwinn et al  1998 ) .",
    "when the birefringence is included , this model reproduces the result @xmath1 derived from the formal theory of scattering in a magnetized plasma in paper  i. this simple model corresponds to strong diffractive scintillation , suggesting that our expression for @xmath12 applies only to a source that exhibits strong diffractive scintillations ( which is the case for pulsars but not for quasars ) .",
    "further physical interpretation of scintillation - induced cp is developed in section  3 , where it is argued that it arises from a combination of two processes : a rippling of the wavefront , as in the conventional theory for scattering in a turbulent medium , combined with random refractions in the birefringent medium that cause a separation in the rays associated with the opposite cps .",
    "this leads to the following interpretation : the ripples in the wavefront for the two cps become spatially separated due to the random birefringent refractions , so that they do not overlap in the observer s plane .",
    "this leads to alternate patches in which one cp and then the other dominates , leading to a nonzero @xmath12 .",
    "this interpretation is the basis for two important generalizations that we propose here .",
    "first , an essential requirement in this interpretation is that the images in the two cps be displaced relative to each other by @xmath13 in the observer s plane .",
    "our interpretation of the formal theory is that this is due to random birefringent scatterings at the putative scattering screen .",
    "however , any mechanism that causes such a displacement of the rays corresponding to the two opposite cps leads to a nonzero @xmath13 and hence to a nonzero @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , an alternative to random birefringent refractions is birefringent refraction at a single structure , which we refer to as a faraday wedge , cf .  section  4 .",
    "second , although the result derived from the formal theory applies for strong diffractive scintillations , our interpretation implies that a nonzero @xmath12 results for any source that exhibits scintillations .",
    "consider a source with a scintillation index @xmath14 on a spatial scale @xmath15 in the observer s plane ; it should exhibit fluctuations in the degree of cp , @xmath16 , that is of order @xmath17 times @xmath14 . in particular ,",
    "a source that exhibits refractive scintillations should exhibit fluctuations in cp on a similar timescale with an amplitude smaller by the factor @xmath17 .    for scintillation - induced cp",
    "to account for the observed cp in quasars and pulsars , two conditions need to be satisfied .",
    "first , the predicted degree of cp , @xmath16 , must be in the observed range , which appears to be @xmath18 for a few pulsars and is @xmath19 for relevant extragalactic sources .",
    "second , the predicted timescale for the fluctuations in cp must be consistent with the observed variations in the cp . for pulsars",
    "this is the diffractive timescale , and for quasars it is the refractive timescale .",
    "these requirements are discussed for pulsars in section  5 , and for extragalactic sources in section  6 .",
    "in this section we show that the main result found in paper  i is reproduced by a simple model for the scattering .",
    "this result is @xmath20 which was derived in paper i for scattering at a single screen for a power - law spectrum of turbulence in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "the assumption that the fluctuations are only in the density implies that @xmath2 is proportional to the phase structure function , @xmath21 , for the phase in the absence of birefringence . assuming a power - law distribution for the turbulence , this implies @xmath22 with @xmath23 for a kolmogorov spectrum of turbulence , and with @xmath24 , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the electron cyclotron frequency and @xmath27 is the angle between the magnetic field and line of sight .    the model for strong scattering that we introduce to interpret the result ( [ relation ] ) involves regarding the amplitude of the wave at the observer s screen as a sum of terms that each correspond to a point of stationary phase ( e.g. , born & wolf 1965 , goodman 1985 , gwinn et al   1998 ) .",
    "the model is illustrated in figure  1 .",
    "there are two relevant contributions to the phase : a rippling on a scale @xmath8 due to the postulated density fluctuations at the screen , and a geometric effect described by a curvature of the mean wavefront on a scale @xmath28 , with the points of stationary phase corresponding to points where the tangent to the wavefront is orthogonal to the line of sight , cf.figure  1 .",
    "let there be @xmath29 such points of stationary phase ( e.g. narayan 1992 ) .",
    "the amplitude in this model is of the form @xmath30 where the @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the amplitude and phase , respectively , associated with the @xmath33th coherent patch ( the @xmath33th point of stationary phase ) .",
    "the @xmath32 are assumed to be a random set of phases uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath34 $ ] . for our purposes",
    "it suffices to assume that all @xmath35 amplitudes are identical , writing @xmath36 for all @xmath33 .",
    "the mean is defined by averaging over the phases .",
    "the intensity is @xmath37 and its variance is @xmath38 for @xmath39 these imply @xmath40 , which is the well - known result for diffractive scintillations .    to include the polarization the wave amplitude , @xmath41 , is separated into its right - hand , @xmath42 , and left - hand , @xmath43 , circularly polarized components , and the intensities in the two cps are identified as @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "the relevant stokes parameters are given by @xmath46 the difference in refractive index between wave in the two cps leads to a phase difference between them , denoted @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath48 be the additional phase associated with the @xmath33th coherent patch .",

    "can be evaluated for a power - law spectrum of the turbulence , as given by ( [ dr ] ) .",

    "the expressions ( [ avev4 ] ) or ( [ avev5 ] ) are valid only for @xmath68 ; this follows from the expansion made in ( [ approx1 ] ) and a related expansion for @xmath69 made in paper  i. however , there is no reason in principle why this condition must be satisfied .",
    "if it is invalid , then the fluctuations in @xmath0 can approach the maximum possible value , @xmath70 .",
    "this simple model for @xmath12 suggests the following interpretation for the result ( [ relation ] ) .",
    "the assumptions made in the calculation in paper  i apply to a source that , in the absence of birefringence , exhibits strong diffractive scintillations .",
    "the inclusion of birefringence leads to random birefringent refractions that cause the two oppositely circularly polarized rays to emerge from the scattering screen propagating in slightly different directions .",
    "this angular separation between the rays implies that the peaks and troughs in the wavefronts in the opposite cps are displaced from each other in the observer s plane .",
    "this separation corresponds to alternating patches of opposite cps , which is described by @xmath12 .",
    "in this section we discuss the interpretation of the function @xmath71 in ( [ relation ] ) in terms of random birefringent refractions .",
    "we then argue that this interpretation allows one to relax two restrictive assumptions made in paper  i to obtain a more general , semiquantitative expression for the predicted scintillation - induced cp .",
    "random refractions in an isotropic medium lead to an angular ( ` scatter ' ) broadening of the source . in scattering theory",
    "this is described in terms of a bundle of rays diffusing in angle of propagation . for our purposes here",
    "a semiquantitative discussion suffices . in refractive scattering ,",
    "the screen acts like a large lens , of size @xmath11 , that causes a phase change of order @xmath72^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the phase change includes a tilt of the wavefront that corresponds to a change in the ray direction .",
    "the typical change in the ray angle is @xmath73 .",

    "this angular separation times the distance , @xmath6 , to the screen leads to a spatial displacement of the images in the two cps of @xmath76 , which implies @xmath77 the expression for @xmath78 obtained in paper  i , and rederived in ( [ avev5 ] ) above , then implies @xmath79    we interpret the form ( [ avev6 ] ) as follows . according to the model in section  2 ,",
    "the source is exhibiting diffractive scintillations that correspond to a rippling of the wavefront such that there are patches of constructive and destructive interference with a characteristic size @xmath8 .",
    "the birefringence causes a relative spatial displacement by @xmath13 of this pattern in the opposite cps . for @xmath80 ,",
    "the partial separation of the images in the opposite cps leads to an image with a degree of cp @xmath81 .",
    "the foregoing discussion shows that two ingredients are essential for scintillation - induced cp : scintillations that produce a pattern of variations with a scale size @xmath15 in the observer s plane , and birefringent refraction that causes a displacement , @xmath13 , between the images in the opposite cps .",
    "the resulting degree of cp is then given by @xmath82^{1/2 } } { \\langle i\\rangle}. \\label{avev7}\\ ] ] with the assumptions made in the models discussed above , the scintillations are diffractive , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath13 is due to random birefringent refractions . more generally , ( [ avev6 ] ) should apply with @xmath14 , @xmath15 corresponding to the observed scintillations , and @xmath13 could be due to birefringent refraction either by a single structure ( faraday wedge ) or by a spectrum of turbulence .",
    "for example , for refractive scintillations one has @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the intensity modulation due to refractive scintillation .",
    "the random birefringent refractions that contribute to scintillation - induced cp through the factor @xmath71 in ( [ relation ] ) are due to gradients in rotation measure ( rm ) associated with the turbulence at the scattering screen .",
    "scintillation - induced cp requires that the wavefront be rippled and that the ripples in the opposite cps be displaced laterally along the wavefront , but it is not necessary that these two features be imposed at a single scattering screen . in this section",
    "we introduce the concept of a faraday wedge in which the lateral displacement along the wavefront of the ripples in the opposite cps is attributed to birefringent refraction at a single structure along the line of sight .",
    "we consider two idealized models for the wedge ; in the first the wedge is modeled as a birefringent region with a density gradient and in the second the wedge is modeled as a prism with sharp edges .",
    "these two models lead to essentially the same semiquantitative result for the angular separation of the rays corresponding to the two cps .",
    "it is useful to view the effects of a faraday wedge in terms of both geometric optics ( rays ) and physical optics ( wavefronts ) . in terms of geometric optics ,",
    "as illustrated in figure  2 , a faraday wedge splits an incident ray into two oppositely circularly polarized emerging rays propagating in slightly different directions , separated by an angle @xmath87 say . after propagating the distance @xmath6 from the wedge to the observer s plane ,",
    "the left- and right - hand images are separated by @xmath88 . for @xmath89",
    "an observer sees well - separated oppositely circularly polarized images of the source for a scintillating source . in terms of physical optics ,",
    "as illustrated in figure  3 , the faraday wedge causes an incident wavefront to split into two wavefronts whose normals are in slightly different directions , separated by @xmath87 .",
    "each wavefront is rippled , and the effect of the faraday wedge applies to the average ( over the ripples ) wavefronts .",
    "( one wavefront is also slightly delayed relative to the other , but this effect is neglected here . ) at the observer s plane , corresponding ripples on the two wavefronts are displaced along the wavefront by @xmath90 . the observer sees a net cp varying on the timescale associated with the scintillations as the whole pattern sweeps across the observer s plane .",
    "the following estimate of the angle @xmath87 applies when there is a smooth gradient in rm . consider a planar wavefront propagating parallel to the @xmath91-axis incident upon a slab of material of thickness @xmath92 , containing spatial variations in the plane transverse to the @xmath91-axis .",
    "as shown in appendix  a , using the paraxial approximation , the angular deviation of the ray in terms of the refractive index variations on the scattering screen is determined by @xmath93 where @xmath45 denotes the two wave modes , @xmath94 is the plane orthogonal to the @xmath91-axis , @xmath95 is the direction of the wavevector and the arguments of the refractive index @xmath96 are suppressed . in the weak anisotropy limit",
    "one writes the refractive index in terms of polarization dependent and independent terms @xmath97 with @xmath98 . for a screen a distance @xmath6 from the observer , the relative displacement of the centers of the images in the two modes on the observer s plane is @xmath99 with @xmath100 the refractive indices depend on the magnetoionic parameters , @xmath101 , @xmath25 , where @xmath102 is the plasma frequency and @xmath26 is the electron cyclotron frequency .",
    "one has @xmath103 , @xmath104 here , with @xmath105 , @xmath106 , where @xmath27 is the angle between the wave - normal direction and @xmath107 .",
    "then dominant contribution to @xmath108 is due to the gradient of @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the contribution of the path length @xmath92 to the rm .",
    "we also introduce the rm phase , @xmath111 , which is the relative phase difference between the two wavefronts .",
    "the displacement between the left- and right - circularly polarized images on the observer s screen reduces to ( further details are given in appendix  b ) @xmath112 where @xmath113 denotes the gradient in the @xmath114-@xmath115 plane .      an alternative model for a faraday wedge",
    ". let the prism have an apex angle of @xmath116 and let its refractive index be @xmath117 greater than the refractive index ( @xmath118 ) in the surroundings . for simplicity ,",
    "suppose that the prism is oriented nearly perpendicular to the line of sight , so that we are interested only rays at small angles relative to the direction perpendicular to the axis of the prism , cf.figure  3 .",
    "then a ray incident at an angle @xmath119 emerges at an angle @xmath120 given by @xmath121 the mean angular deviation , @xmath122 , of a ray at the prism and the difference , @xmath87 , between the emerging ray in the two cps are then given by @xmath123 respectively .",
    "let us compare the results ( [ deltazeta1 ] ) and ( [ deltazeta2 ] ) . retaining only the final term in ( [ deltazeta1 ] ) , assuming the region to be uniform along the @xmath91 direction and with a uniform gradient with a scale length @xmath124 in the perpendicular direction , ( [ deltazeta1 ] ) gives @xmath125 .",
    "thus the two results coincide for @xmath126 .",
    "more generally one can conclude that a faraday wedge leads to a deviation of the rays with opposite cps by an angle @xmath87 which is of order the difference , @xmath127 , in the refractive indices of the two modes within the wedge , times a geometric factor ( @xmath128 or @xmath129 ) which is less than or of order unity .",
    "a faraday wedge leads to cp due to a displacement , @xmath13 , between ripples in the wavefronts corresponding to opposite cps .",
    "suppose that the ripples have a scale length @xmath15 and that the modulation index , @xmath14 , of the intensity due to these ripples",
    ". then one should observe fluctuations in cp with an rms degree of cp of @xmath130 on a characteristic timescale @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the speed at which the pattern moves across the observer s plane .",
    "for diffractive scattering one has @xmath133 and @xmath83 , and for refractive scattering one has @xmath134 and @xmath135 , with @xmath136 for a kolmogorov spectrum @xmath23 . for a source of angular size @xmath137 to exhibit scintillations requires @xmath138 and @xmath139 for diffractive and refractive scattering , respectively .    a semi - quantitative estimate for when these conditions are satisfied is deduced from equation ( [ avev7 ] ) as follows .",
    "with @xmath140 , we require @xmath141 for diffractive scintillations and @xmath142 for refractive scintillations . hence we require @xmath143 if the angular deviation , @xmath87 , between the rays in the two modes is dominated by a single structure ( single faraday wedge ) , which contributes @xmath144rm to the total rm , then one has @xmath145 , where @xmath124 is a distance that characterizes the gradient in rm . the condition ( [ condition2 ] ) includes the requirement @xmath146 . assuming that the faraday wedge has a density @xmath147 and a magnetic induction @xmath148 , @xmath144rm is proportional to @xmath149 times the line of sight distance , @xmath92 through the structure",
    ". then the condition ( [ condition2 ] ) reduces to @xmath150 , and on inserting numerical values , this becomes @xmath151 physically , the dependence on @xmath128 is due to the requirement that refraction cause a large enough separation between the rays in the two cps .",
    "the region acts like a prism with a small angle at its apex ; the deviation of the ray is zero when this angle is zero ( the prism reduces to a slab ) , and the deviation increases as this angle increases .",
    "the condition ( [ condition3 ] ) is not easily satisfied : it requires an exceptionally dense , strongly magnetized region along the line of sight , and it is more easily satisfied at longer wavelengths .",
    "the degree of cp observed in most pulsars is relatively small ( e.g. , han et al  1999 ) .",
    "however , the degree of cp usually quoted refers to the pulse - averaged quantity .",
    "studies of single pulses are possible for a small subset of pulsars , and the cp in single pulses can be very much greater than the pulse - averaged cp ( manchester , taylor & huguenin 1975 ) .",
    "thus the pulse - averaged cp appears to be the mean value of a cp that can vary greatly on a timescale of order the pulse period .",
    "there is no satisfactory explanation for the pulse - averaged cp ( e.g. , radhakrishnan & rankin 1990 ; kazbegi , machabeli & melikidze 1991 ; radhakrishnan 1992 ) .",
    "it is usually assumed this is imposed either by the emission process or by propagation in the pulsar magnetosphere . in this section",
    "we discuss the possibility that this rapidly varying component in the cp might be due to the faraday wedge effect associated with diffractive scintillations induced by propagation through the ism .",
    "we apply the foregoing ideas to the vela pulsar for which there is direct evidence for rm fluctuations .",
    "three parameters are required to estimate the magnitude of the cp generated by the faraday wedge : the magnitude of the rm gradient , the slope of the power spectrum of density inhomogeneities , @xmath152 , and the refractive scale , @xmath63 .",
    "we list our best estimates of these parameters , and then use these to estimate the degree of cp expected according to the foregoing theory .",
    "hamilton , hall & costa ( 1985 ) reported a linear change in rm across the vela pulsar for the interval 1970 - 1985 .",
    "the best fit to the rm gradient is 0.73 rad / m@xmath153/yr , which translates into a spatial rm gradient of @xmath154 rad@xmath155m@xmath156 , where @xmath157 is the speed of the wedge transverse to the line of sight in km@xmath155s@xmath158 .",
    "we assume the kolmogorov value of @xmath23 for the power spectrum of density inhomogeneities for this pulsar .",
    "this is consistent with some measurements , although we note that the measurements of refractive flux variations are more consistent with @xmath152 closer to 3.9 ( johnston , nicastro & koribalski 1998 ) .",
    "the size of the scattering disk , as measured by gwinn ( 1997 ) , is @xmath159 au at around 2.3 ghz .",
    "( the actual measurement band was from 2.273 to 2.801 ghz ) .",
    "the refractive length , @xmath63 , scales as @xmath160}$ ] .    in estimating the faraday rotation phase change across the scattering disk , we choose an observing frequency of 600 mhz , where the effect of faraday rotation is strong . scaling the refractive length to this frequency , one has @xmath161au .",
    "combining this with our estimate of the rm gradient , the total rm change across the scattering disk , @xmath162 , is @xmath163 . to calculate the root - mean - square degree of cp we use this estimate of @xmath63 in equation ( [ avev7 ] ) for diffractive scintillation , giving @xmath164 , assuming that @xmath165 is 100 ( 500 ) .",
    "we conclude that measurement of scintillation - induced cp is feasible for the vela pulsar , and that it is likely to be feasible for other pulsars at low frequency .",
    "although not discussed in detail here , there are several other pulsars known to exhibit variability in rm , including the crab pulsar ( rankin et al .",
    "1988 ) and psr  1259 - 63 ( johnston et al  1986 ) , which exhibits rm variations of @xmath166 radm@xmath167 on timescales of 0.5 hr . an observational test of the scintillation - induced cp model requires statistics on the variance in the cp in individual pulses , and the way this variance changes with frequency of observation .",
    "a small but significant degree of cp ( @xmath168% to a few % ) is observed in some compact extragalactic radio sources ( e.g. , roberts et al  1975 , weiler & de pater 1982 , de pater & weiler 1982 , komesaroff et al  1984 ) .",
    "the suggested interpretations include the intrinsic polarization associated with synchrotron radiation ( legg & westfold 1968 ) , and partial conversion of linear into circular polarization due to ellipticity of the natural wave modes of the cold background plasma ( pacholczyk 1973 ) or of the relativistic electron gas itself ( e.g. , sazonov 1969 , jones & odell 1977a , b ) .",
    "however none of these suggested interpretations has proved satisfactory in accounting for ( a ) the frequency dependence , ( b ) the temporal variations , and ( c ) the magnitude of the observed cp . here",
    "we explore the possibility that the cp observed in compact extragalactic sources is scintillation - induced cp .",
    "we consider the requirements for scintillations to produce 0.1% cp due to scintillation either in our galaxy or in the host object .",
    "scintillation - induced cp relies on birefringent refraction , which is determined by the gradient in rm . to estimate the degree of cp using equation ( [ avev7 ] ) requires an estimate of the parameter @xmath13 , which is determined by ( [ dvv ] ) with ( [ dr ] ) .",
    "our estimate for the cp then reduces to @xmath169 where we ignore an observed slight excess in the relative fluctuations in rm in our galaxy compared with the relative fluctuations in the electron density ( minter & spangler 1996 ) .",
    "we estimate the degree of cp at 5  ghz . for a screen at distance of @xmath170kpc ,",
    "the fresnel scale is @xmath171 m .",
    "the length scale @xmath8 is estimated from the frequency , @xmath172 , at which the scattering becomes strong , at @xmath173 , and from the fact that @xmath8 scales proportional to @xmath174 .",
    "we assume a kolmogorov spectrum of density inhomogeneities , @xmath23 . for an object located off the galactic plane one",
    "typically has @xmath175ghz ( walker 1998 ) , yielding @xmath176 m at 5  ghz . taking @xmath177 g one has @xmath178 which yields @xmath179 .",
    "hence , we conclude that the contribution of galactic rm fluctuations to the cp is negligible .",
    "next consider rm variations internal to an extragalactic source .",
    "the theory ( developed in paper i ) needs to be modified slightly if the faraday wedge is assumed to be located in the host object because the non - planarity of the wavefront can not be ignored .",
    "the modifications for a spherical wavefront involve making the substitutions ( goodman & narayan 1989 ) @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the distance from the source to the scattering screen and @xmath182 the distance from the screen to the observer . using equations ( 4.9 ) in ( 5.21 ) in paper  i",

    "we choose the specific object 3c  345 for which there is an estimated dependence ( matveenko et al  1996 ) of @xmath184rad / m@xmath153 on radial distance @xmath185 from the core , where @xmath186pc corresponds to an angular size of 1  mas .",
    "consider the rm gradient required to produce 0.1% cp at 5  ghz .",
    "since the scattering is likely to be concentrated around the agn core we take an effective distance of @xmath187pc between the source and screen and @xmath188 m .",
    "one then requires @xmath189 rad / m@xmath190 .",
    "we conclude that variations in the large - scale rm are large enough to produce this degree of cp within the central @xmath191pc of the core .",
    "the distance between the source and the screen is assumed to be @xmath192  pc .",
    "there is no direct evidence for this parameter and our choice is based on a plausibility argument in view of the known scattering parameters of sgr  a*. sgr  a * is an agn - like object at our own galactic center which appears to exhibit refractive scintillation ( e.g. , zhao & goss 1993 ) , presumably due to turbulence in a medium @xmath193  pc from the source ( backer 1978 ) .",
    "our plausibility argument is simply that compact extragalactic sources are likely to have some similarities to sgr  a * , and that it is plausible that they scintillate due to turbulence in the surrounding interstellar medium @xmath193  pc from the source .",
    "the foregoing estimates apply when the source exhibits diffractive scintillation .",
    "cp can also result from refractive scintillation , for which the source size requirement is less stringent .",
    "however , the requirement on the separation of the two senses of cp is more stringent : the faraday wedge must cause a separation that is a significant fraction of the scale on which refractive flux variations occur .",
    "thus , one requires ( cf .",
    "equation ( [ avev7 ] ) ) @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the refractive modulation index .",
    "for example , the rm gradient in 3c  345 used above is sufficiently large that a centrally - located object small enough to exhibit refractive scintillation would produce @xmath196 cp at 5  ghz provided the rm gradient is greater than @xmath197rad / m@xmath190 . according to the rm model used above , such gradients are encountered within the central @xmath198pc of the core .    similar data available on large rm gradients on milliarcsecond scales near the cores of other extragalactic objects ( roberts et al  1990 , udomprasert et al  1997 , cawthorne et al .  1997 ,",
    "taylor 1998 ) suggests that cp due to this effect is possible for a broad class of extragalactic sources .",
    "the timescale of variability in the cp depends on the relative speed , @xmath199 , of the screen and the source and on the relative speed , @xmath200 of the observer and the screen .",
    "the speed at which the pattern moves across the observer s plane is @xmath201 , and the observer moves across this plane at @xmath200 .",
    "the pattern scale at the observer is @xmath202 for diffractive scintillation and @xmath203 for refractive scintillation .",
    "the timescale for variations in @xmath0 is determined by the pattern scale of the oppositely circularly polarized regions divided by the relevant speed .",
    "for a point source , diffractive scintillation would be observed on a timescale @xmath204 , and refractive scintillation would be observed on a timescale @xmath205 , where it is assumed that the relevant speed is that of the screen relative to the source .",
    "this is the case for @xmath206 , since the apparent speed of the scattering material across the line of sight dominates the motion of the observer across the pattern .",
    "taking @xmath207km / s with the parameters assumed above , the timescale of diffractive variations is @xmath208s and the refractive timescale is @xmath209s .",
    "based on these estimates , diffractive variations should exhibit reversals in sign of the cp on a timescale of a few minutes , which does not explain the observed variability over hours to days ( komesaroff et al  1984 ) .",
    "although the refractive timescale is closer to observed timescale of cp variations in extragalactic sources , evidence for reversals in the sense of the cp on this timescale is lacking .",
    "it was shown in paper i that propagation of radio waves through a magnetized inhomogeneous plasma leads to fluctuations in circular polarization ( cp ) , even if the scintillating source is itself unpolarized .",
    "although the mean cp induced by propagation through the medium is zero , the variance , @xmath78 , is nonzero .",
    "the generation of this cp is attributed to a gradient in rm , called a faraday wedge , leading to a lateral displacement at the observer s plane of the wavefronts for opposite cps .",
    "inhomogeneities in the ism introduce corrugations into the wavefront , and the displacement of these at the observer s plane leads to alternate regions of opposite cp . as the ism moves across the line of sight to a source , an observer samples these alternate patches of opposite cps .",
    "the mean cp is zero , and the variance is nonzero .",
    "the effect is significant provided that the lateral displacement of the corrugations in the wavefronts for the opposite cps is a significant fraction of ( or larger than ) the typical size of the corrugations .",
    "this scintillation - induced cp varies on the timescale associated with the scintillations . for a source undergoing diffractive scintillations ,",
    "the cp varies on the diffractive timescale , and for a source undergoing refractive scintillations , the cp varies on the refractive timescale .",
    "pulsars exhibit both diffractive and refractive scintillations , and one expects them to exhibit scintillation - induced cp on a timescale associated with the diffractive scintillation .",
    "the observed cp in pulsars can be several tens of percent , but it may be that some of this cp results from birefringence in the pulsar magnetosphere itself , which we do not consider here . based on data on rm variations associated with the vela pulsar we predict that scintillation - induced cp is likely to be observable .",
    "we suggest here that the pulse to pulse variation in cp observed in some pulsars is due to this effect .",
    "there is a strong case that the small ( @xmath210% ) degree of cp exhibited by some compact extragalactic sources is due to scintillation - induced cp .",
    "the high rms ( e.g. , udomprasert et al  1997 ) and proposed strong magnetic fields ( rees 1987 ) near the cores of agn are sufficient to generate the observed degree of cp in association with refractive scintillation .",
    "a prediction is that scintillation - induced cp should reverse sign randomly , such that the average value is zero .",
    "there is some evidence for this for pulsars , for which the pulse - averaged cp is small compared with the relatively high cp in individual pulses .",
    "however , there is no strong evidence for reversals in the sense of cp for extragalactic sources . to determine whether or not this is compatible with the theory requires further consideration of the nature of rm fluctuations . one obvious point concerns the distinction between mean rms and the variance of the rm",
    ". if the length scale over which the magnetic field changes orientation is short compared to the path length through the medium , the variance in the difference between the phases of the left- and right - hand polarized wavefronts may be very much larger than the mean value .",
    "this point is exemplified by studies of the ism which seek to relate the mean electron density along a line of sight to its scattering properties .",
    "based on the variation of @xmath211 observed in the galaxy , @xmath212 is predicted to vary by 1.3 orders of magnitude , however the observed variation is considerably larger , at 4.2 orders of magnitude ( cordes , weisberg & borkiakoff 1985 ) . for the same reason ,",
    "the mean rm along a given line of sight may not reflect the degree of scintillation - induced cp expected .",
    "the generation of cp due to ultra fine scale structure in the magnetic field also needs to be addressed .",
    "if the observed density fluctuations in the ism are the result of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence , one expects similarly fine scale structure in the magnetic field .",
    "this also is expected to boost the importance of scintillation - induced cp in the ism .",
    "further detailed modeling of this effect is warranted .",
    "we thank mark walker for suggesting the effect of rm gradients and ron ekers for helpful discussions relating to extragalactic sources .",
    "we wish to evaluate the integral @xmath213^{(\\beta-2)/2}. \\label{dijequn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the expansion @xmath214 equation ( [ dijequn ] ) becomes a series of products of 2-dimensional integrals : @xmath215 an observer sees speckles over the entire scattering disk of radius @xmath63 , and this provides a cutoff to the distribution @xmath216 .",
    "for the purposes of calculation , we approximate the outer boundary of the speckle pattern as a _ square _ of area @xmath63 .",
    "we then have @xmath217 making the substitutions @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 and @xmath221 , we then have @xmath222 where the integration area is taken into account as follows : @xmath223 using @xmath224 provided @xmath225 and @xmath226 , and @xmath227 we obtain @xmath228 \\nonumber \\\\    & \\null & \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\times \\left [     \\frac{1}{(\\beta-2m)(\\beta-2m-1 ) } \\right ] \\\\",

    "here we derive the result of the ray - bending due to the faraday wedge model discussed in  [ faradaywedge ] .",
    "the relative displacement of the right- and left - polarized wavefronts is derived using hamiltonian equations for a ray .",
    "these are @xmath229 in a stationary medium , assumed here , the third equation is not relevant . in the paraxial approximation one separates @xmath230 into @xmath91 , @xmath231 , with the @xmath91 axis along @xmath232 . the relation @xmath233 is used after combining the first and second of equations ( [ hamiltoneqns ] ) to yield an expression for the angular deviation of the ray in terms of the refractive index variations on the scattering screen @xmath93 where the arguments of @xmath234 are suppressed .",
    "the change , @xmath235 , across a wedge of thickness @xmath92 is given by @xmath236 in the weak anisotropy limit one writes the refractive index in terms of polarization dependent and independent terms @xmath97 with @xmath237 to simplify this to @xmath238 { \\partial n\\over\\partial{\\bf r } } + \\frac{\\sigma}{2 } { \\partial \\delta n\\over\\partial{\\bf r } } \\right\\ } , \\label{deltakappa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] neglecting terms of order @xmath239 .",
    "thus , if the screen is a distance @xmath6 from the observer , the relative displacement of the centers of the images in the two modes on the observer s plane is @xmath240 , as given by equation ( [ deltazeta1 ] ) .",
