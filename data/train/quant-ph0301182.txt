    "they are a subset of a wider model of computation , cellular automata , which have been proved universal for classical computation .",
    "the utility of classical walks suggests that extending the formalism to the quantum regime may assist the new field of quantum information processing in generating further quantum algorithms .",
    "similarly to the classical case , it is also possible to define the notion of quantum cellular automata , whose equivalence to quantum turing machines has been shown @xcite .",
    "most known quantum algorithms are based on the _ quantum fourier transform _",
    ", for an introduction to quantum computing and algorithms see , e.  g. , @xcite .",
    "quantum versions of random walks provide a distinctly different paradigm in which to develop quantum algorithms .",
    "very recently , two such algorithms have been presented .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proved that a quantum walk can perform the same task as grover s search algorithm @xcite , with the same quadratic speed up .",
    "childs _ et al . _",
    "@xcite describe a quantum algorithm for transversing a particular graph exponentially faster than can be done classically .",
    "this exponential speed up is very promising , though the problem presented is somewhat contrived .",
    "in fact , several possible extensions of classical random walks to the quantum regime have been proposed @xcite , however , here we will only treat the _ discrete time , coined quantum walks _",
    "@xcite , subsequently these are referred to simply as `` quantum walks '' . before introducing quantum walks , it is helpful to review the properties of classical random walks",
    ". this is followed by an overview of quantum walks on a line , @xmath1-cycle , and hypercube .",
    "section [ qrwdec ] presents our results on the effects of decoherence in these quantum walks .",
    "the discrete space on which a random walk takes place can most generally be described as a graph @xmath2 with two components , a set of vertices @xmath3 , and a set of edges @xmath4 .",
    "an edge may be specified by the pair of vertices that it connects , @xmath5 .",
    "the graph is _ undirected _ when @xmath6 .",
    "the second essential feature of a classical walk is the ( time - independent ) transition matrix @xmath7 , whose elements @xmath8 provide the probability for a transition from vertex @xmath9 to vertex @xmath10 .",
    "these probabilities are non - zero only for a pair of vertices connected by an edge , @xmath11 the walk is _ unbiased _ if the non - zero elements of @xmath7 are given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the degree of the vertex @xmath9 ( the number of edges connected to @xmath9 ) .",
    "a graph is called _ regular ( @xmath14-regular ) _ if all vertices have equal degree ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the state of a classical random walk at a given time @xmath15 is described by a probability distribution @xmath16 over the vertices @xmath17 .",
    "this distribution evolves at each time step by application of the transition matrix @xmath7 , @xmath18    a number of features of these classical walks are worthy of note for later comparisons . if @xmath19 is _ connected _ ( every pair of vertices have a path linking them via a sequence of edges ) , then the walk tends to a steady state distribution @xmath20 which is independent of the initial state @xmath21 .",
    "further , if the graph is regular then the limiting distribution is uniform on all the vertices .",
    "an exception arises in the case of periodic random walks , however , a `` resting probability '' for the walk to remain at the current vertex may be added which breaks the periodicity and restores the usual convergence .",
    "the rate of convergence to this limiting distribution may described in a number of ways , here we choose the _ mixing time _ , @xmath22 the measure used here is the _ total variational distance _ , @xmath23 the mixing time thus gives a measure of the time after which the distribution is within a distance @xmath24 of the limiting distribution and remains at least this close .",
    "an alternative measure that is useful in classical algorithms , for example 3-sat @xcite , is the _ hitting time_. this is defined for a pair of vertices @xmath25 , @xmath26 as the expected time at which a walk starting at @xmath25 reaches @xmath26 for the first time .      given a @xmath14-regular graph , @xmath2 , the associated hilbert space may be defined as @xmath27 as already mentioned , several extensions of classical random walks to the quantum regime have been proposed , there is no unique way to do this . to guide us",
    ", we note there are several properties of classical random walks and quantum systems that we would like such quantum walks to have , if possible .",
    "the three desirable properties of the classical transition matrix @xmath7 are ,    * locality : @xmath28 , i.  e. , transitions are only between vertices directly connected by an edge * homogeneity : if @xmath29 , i.  e. , equal probability of transition to any neighbouring vertex * time independence : the current step does not depend in any way on previous steps of the random walk ( markovian )    the quantum transition matrix @xmath30 , equivalent to @xmath7 , should have similar properties to @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , it should be    * unitary    because all pure quantum processes are unitary . as proved by meyer @xcite ,",
    "this requirement of unitarity is incompatible with the three prior properties , except in very special circumstances that do nt produce interesting quantum dynamics . in order to generate a non - trivial quantum evolution",
    ", one or more of these constraints must be relaxed .",
    "the continuous time quantum walks proposed by farhi and gutmann @xcite , is non - local , in the sense that there is a small probability of the particle moving arbitrarily far away in a given unit time interval .",
    "the quantum cellular automata of meyer @xcite are not homogeneous , in that the full dynamics is specified over two time steps rather than one .",
    "one may make the quantum walk non - unitary by measuring the particle at each step , but this simply reproduces the classical random walk .",
    "finally , one may consider relaxing the time independence condition slightly , and this is what the coined quantum walks effectively do .",
    "for completeness , we note that there is an equivalent formulation of the coined quantum walk in terms of a simple quantum process on a directed graph , derived from the original undirected graph , that is due to watrous @xcite .      by analogy with the classical walk ,",
    "in which one pictures flipping a coin at each time - step to determine which edge to leave the current vertex by , interesting quantum results may be obtained by the introduction of an explicit ( quantum ) coin .",
    "in addition to the particle , with associated hilbert space @xmath31 as given in ( [ ptclhsp ] ) , there is an auxiliary quantum system , the coin , with a hilbert space of dimension @xmath14 ( the degree of the graph ) @xmath32 .",
    "the transition matrix is then defined as a unitary matrix @xmath30 acting on the tensor product of these two spaces .",
    "this unitary is constructed from two separate operators , a `` coin flip '' and a conditional translation . for an unbiased walk , the coin flip operator ,",
    "@xmath33 is a unitary matrix whose elements all have equal modulus in the computational basis of the coin .",
    "this adds significant new degrees of freedom to the system , as the relative phases of these elements may be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "the conditional translation @xmath34 moves the particle along an edge to an adjacent vertex determined by the state of the coin .",
    "the evolution of the system from an initial state @xmath35 to @xmath36 after @xmath15 steps is thus given by , @xmath37^t{\\mbox{$|\\psi(0)\\rangle$}}_{\\mathrm{cv}}\\;. \\label{coinevol}\\ ] ] the coin can also be thought of as forming a @xmath14-state quantum memory from one step to the next , allowing a much wider range of dynamics to be fully reversible ( a necessary property of unitary evolution ) .",
    "unitary evolution is also completely deterministic , so the choice of initial condition is never `` washed out '' , rather , it plays a key role in determining the outcome of the quantum walk .",
    "unitarity also means that the joint state of the coin and particle can never reach a steady state .",
    "even the induced probability distribution over the nodes obtained by tracing out the coin , @xmath38{\\mbox{$|v\\rangle$}}_{\\mathrm{v}}\\ ; , \\label{pdef}\\ ] ] does not converge to a long - time limit .",
    "however , it is possible to define a time - averaged probability distribution that does reach a steady state , @xmath39 operationally , this is easy to produce , it is the distribution obtained by sampling the particle location at some time @xmath15 uniformly selected at random from @xmath40 . using this distribution",
    "it is possible to define a quantum mixing time similar to that in ( [ cme ] ) , @xmath41    the second measure discussed for classical random walks was the hitting time .",
    "this can also be extended to quantum walks , but as before will require some modification .",
    "in the classical case it is possible to measure the location of the particle at each time step to ascertain whether or not it has reached the desired vertex . the equivalent quantum measurement disturbs the system ; if a complete projection onto the vertex hilbert space is performed at each step then all coherences are lost and a classical distribution results .",
    "there are two approaches to this problem that have been used in the literature @xcite .",
    "it would be possible to wait until a chosen time , @xmath42 , and then perform a full measurement over all the vertices .",
    "if the probability of being at the desired vertex is greater than some value @xmath43 which is bounded below by an inverse polynomial in the size of the graph , it is said that the walk has a @xmath44 one - shot hitting time .",
    "( this lowerr bound ensures that standard amplification procedures can efficiently raise the success probability arbitrarily close to unity . )",
    "the second alternative is to perform a partial measurement at each time step .",
    "projecting onto the subspaces given by the desired vertex @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and its orthogonal complement , @xmath47 will halt the walk once the vertex @xmath45 is reached .",
    "a walk has a @xmath44 concurrent hitting time if @xmath48 is measured with probability greater or equal to @xmath43 , which again must have as a lower bound an inverse polynomial in the graph size , in a time @xmath42 .",
    "both these quantities have been shown to exhibit an exponential speed up over the classical case for a walk between opposite corners of a hypercube @xcite .",
    "explicit solution of a quantum walk has proved to be a difficult problem . in certain cases",
    "standard techniques from classical graph theory have been applied with some success , namely solution in the fourier space of the problem @xcite , and also the technique of generating functions @xcite .",
    "fourier solutions are possible when the graph is of a particular form , known as a cayley graph .",
    "any discrete group has an associated cayley graph , in which the elements of the group form the vertices and the edges are placed by choosing a complete set of generators , @xmath49 and placing an edge between the vertices @xmath50 and @xmath51 iff , @xmath52 for one of the @xmath49 .",
    "this produces an undirected graph results if the group is abelian .",
    "we will next consider three specific cases of such graphs for which analytical solution has proved possible .      consider the case when the graph consists of an lattice of points at integer positions on an infinite line .",
    "the hilbert space of the particle is represented by the integers , @xmath53 at each time interval the particle can move one step to either the left or the right , the coin thus requires only a two dimensional hilbert space which can conveniently be written as , @xmath54 the conditional translation @xmath34 thus has the following action on the basis states , @xmath55 the evolution of the probability distribution induced on the lattice may now be compared with that of the analogous classical walk on a line .",
    "it is sufficient to us the hadamard operator as the coin flip , @xmath56 all others are essentially equivalent @xcite .",
    "we also choose the initial state to be @xmath57 this choice produces a symmetric distribution , as in the classical case . since @xmath58 and @xmath34 contain only real elements , there is no interference between the part of the walk due to the initial state and that due to @xmath59 .",
    "thus the natural ( in terms of basis states ) outcome of a quantum walk is actually biased , unlike a classical random walk , a basic demonstration of the initial condition affecting the entire outcome of the walk .",
    "four steps of this evolution are shown schematically in fig .",
    "( [ qrwline ] ) and the respective probability distributions are shown in fig .",
    "( [ qrw100pdf ] ) after 100 time steps .",
    "the classical walk forms a binomial distribution , with a mean of 0 and standard deviation @xmath60 .",
    "figure [ qrw100pdf ] displays several of the interesting features of a quantum walk .",
    "the central interval @xmath61 $ ] is essentially uniform in the quantum case , with oscillating peaks outside this region up to @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "this is due to interference between the large number of possible paths to each point in this range .",
    "the quantum walk on a line has been solved exactly @xcite using both real space ( path counting ) and fourier space methods .",
    "the solutions are complicated , mainly due to the `` parity '' property , namely , that the solutions must have support only on even(odd)-numbered lattice sites at even(odd ) times .",
    "the moments can be calculated for asymptotically large times , for a walk starting at the origin , the standard deviation is @xmath63 the standard deviation @xmath64 is thus linear in @xmath42 , in contrast to @xmath65 for the classical walk .",
    "quantum walks on a line have now been studied in considerable detail .",
    "discussions of absorbing boundaries have been given @xcite , with applications to halting problems in mind .",
    "extensions to multiple coins have been made by brun _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . however , though useful for understanding the basic properties of quantum walks , the walk on a line is too simple to yield interesting quantum problems for significant algorithms .",
    "if periodic boundary conditions are applied , instead of a walk on an infinite line , a closed walk on a @xmath1-cycle is obtained . for this system , which wraps round on itself , the standard deviation is inappropriate and mixing times must be considered .",
    "the classical result is well known , @xmath66 here the time average of the probability distribution , @xmath67 has been used in ( [ cme ] ) for ease of comparison with the quantum case . the usual mixing time defined by ( [ cme ] ) using @xmath68 scales as @xmath69 .",
    "the scaling of @xmath24 is not important for the quantum  classical comparisons we will do here , more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the equivalent quantity for a quantum walk was bounded above by aharonov _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , and shows a quadratic speed - up , @xmath70 bounds have also been established in the case of more general graphs and it is conjectured that mixing times can be improved at most polynomially by quantum walks @xcite .",
    "numerical studies , see @xcite , suggest the form of the quantum mixing time is actually @xmath71 , and explain why tighter analytical bounds are hard to obtain .",
    "a hypercube of dimension @xmath1 is a cayley graph with @xmath72 vertices labelled by the bit - strings of length @xmath1 .",
    "the hilbert space for this graph is spanned by the basis states @xmath73 $ ] .",
    "each vertex has degree @xmath1 , so the state space of the coin is @xmath74 .",
    "the basis vectors of this space are denoted by @xmath75 $ ] .",
    "these states correspond to the @xmath1 vectors @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the vector with all zeroes except for a single one in the @xmath78 position .",
    "the translation operator for the walk on a hypercube can then be defined as , @xmath79 any @xmath80 unitary matrix with all elements of unit modulus may be used as an unbiased coin , however , this is not the most natural choice given the symmetries of the hypercube . instead",
    ", a biased coin has been selected , which distinguishes the edge along which the particle arrived at the vertex from all the others @xcite .",
    "this `` grover '' coin acts thus , @xmath81 the full evolution for a single time step of this walk is then given by @xmath82 .",
    "the quantum walk on the hypercube can be solved analytically by mapping it to a walk on a line with a variable coin operator , provided the symmetry of the hypercube is maintained throughout . to preserve the symmetry between particle states with equal hamming weights , defined to be the number of 1 s in their bit - string",
    ", the initial state must be chosen to be localised on the hypercube at with the coin in an equal superposition of all its states , @xmath83 . with this ansatz",
    "it has been shown by moore and russell @xcite that the walk has an exact _ instantaneous _ mixing time , when the distribution transiently becomes exactly uniform , at @xmath84 .",
    "more importantly , kempe @xcite found the first exponential gap between classical and quantum walks for hitting times on the hypercube .",
    "both the concurrent and one - shot hitting times for a walk to travel from to are found to be @xmath85 , with small error probability .",
    "this is exponentially faster than the classical hitting time , @xmath86 .",
    "this is not a true quantum speed up , since there are more sophisticated classical algorithms than a random walk to reach the opposite corner that exploit the symmetry of the hypercube .",
    "nonetheless , it is important as the first indication that quantum walks have the potential for driving quantum algorithms with exponentially faster , later confirmed by childs _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite on a more random graph .",
    "we will now study each of the three systems just introduced in the presence of decoherence .",
    "a simple model of decoherence is chosen here , at each time step of the quantum walk a measurement is made in the computational basis with a probability @xmath43 .",
    "we consider three cases , where the measurement is over only the coin degrees of freedom , only over the particle states , or is a complete measurement of both . given a unitary transform @xmath87 for each step of the walk as described by ( [ coinevol ] ) , the effect of this decoherence model can be described as a discrete master equation , @xmath88 the summation runs over the dimensions of the hilbert space on which the decoherence occurs , either the coin @xmath89 , the particle @xmath90 or both @xmath91 . the projectors @xmath92 are defined to act in the computational basis . when @xmath93 the ideal quantum walk is obtained , and for @xmath94 when a measurement is made at each time step it produces the classical random walk .",
    "since there is an experimental proposal to implement a quantum walk on a line in an optical lattice @xcite , as well as the three examples for @xmath92 given above , we considered the likely form of experimental errors , and also modeled the effect of an imperfect hadamard on the coin .",
    "the hadamard operation may be considered to be a `` rotation '' about the computational basis by @xmath95 , ( actually a rotation and reflection since @xmath96 ) , @xmath97 the error model used in this case consisted of a gaussian spread of standard deviation @xmath98 about the ideal value of @xmath99 .",
    "the slope of @xmath100 is finite as @xmath102 and zero at @xmath103 .",
    "we have calculated @xmath100 analytically for @xmath104 and @xmath105 for the case where @xmath92 is the projector onto the preferred basis @xmath106 , i.  e. , the decoherence affecting both particle and coin .",
    "details are given in @xcite ) , the result is @xmath107\\;.\\ ] ] the first order dependence is thus proportional to @xmath108 , so the sensitivity to decoherence grows linearly in @xmath42 for a given decoherence rate @xmath43 .",
    "there are interesting differences in the shape of the distribution of the particle position for each of the types of decoherence .",
    "the decoherence rate that gives the closest to uniform distribution has been selected and plotted in fig . [ linedist ] , along with the pure quantum and classical distributions for comparison .",
    "when the particle position is subject to decoherence that tends to localise the particle in the standard basis , this produces a highly uniform distribution between @xmath110 for a particular choice of @xmath43 .",
    "the optimal decoherence rate @xmath111 can be obtained by minimising the total variational distance between the actual and uniform distributions , @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the probability of finding the particle at position @xmath114 after @xmath42 time steps , regardless of coin state [ compare ( [ pdef ] ) ] , and @xmath115 for @xmath116 and zero otherwise .",
    "the optimum decoherence rate depends on the number of steps in the walk , it can be determined numerically that @xmath117 for decoherence on both the particle and the coin , and @xmath118 for decoherence on the particle only .",
    "these differences in the quality of the uniform distribution are independent of @xmath43 and @xmath42 , and provide an order of magnitude ( 0.6 down to 0.06 ) improvement in @xmath119 over the pure quantum value .",
    "decoherence just on the coin does not enhance the uniformity of the distribution , as fig .",
    "[ linedist ] shows , there is a cusp at @xmath120 .",
    "we now consider a walk on a @xmath1-cycle subjected to decoherence .",
    "there is an experimental proposal for implementation of a quantum walk on a cycle in the phase of a cavity field @xcite , in which further aspects of decoherence in such quantum walks are considered .",
    "recall from sect .",
    "[ ex_lorc ] that the pure quantum walk on a cycle with @xmath1 odd , is known @xcite to mix in time @xmath121 if a hadamard coin is used .",
    "the quantum walk on a cycle with @xmath1 even does not mix to the uniform distribution with a hadamard coin , but can be made to do so by appropriate choice of coin flip operator @xcite . under the action of a small amount of decoherence , the mixing time becomes shorter for all cases , typical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ mixcycle ] .",
    "in particular , decoherence causes the even-@xmath1 cycle to mix to the uniform distribution even when a hadamard coin is used .",
    "the asymptotes in fig .",
    "[ mixcycle ] for @xmath1 even and decoherence on the coin only , for @xmath127 , are well fitted by @xmath128 for @xmath1 divisible by 2 , and @xmath129 for @xmath1 divisible by 4 . for larger",
    "@xmath43 , the mixing time tends to the classical value of @xmath130 .",
    "although for @xmath1 divisible by 4 , the ( coin - decohered ) mixing time shows a minimum below the classical value at @xmath131 , this mixing time is still quadratic in @xmath1 .",
    "thus although noise on the coin causes the even-@xmath1 cycle to mix to the uniform distribution , it does not produce a significant speed up over the classical random walk .    for decoherence on the particle position , with @xmath132 , @xmath133 for @xmath1 divisible by 2 , and @xmath134 for @xmath1 divisible by 4 .",
    "at @xmath135 , there is a minimum in the mixing time at a value roughly equal to the @xmath136-cycle pure quantum mixing time , @xmath137 ( with @xmath138 a constant of order unity ) .",
    "decoherence on the particle position thus causes the even-@xmath1 cycle to mix in linear time for a suitable choice of decoherence rate @xmath139 , independent of @xmath24 so long as @xmath140 .    for all types of decoherence",
    ", the odd-@xmath1 cycle shows a minimum mixing time at a position somewhat earlier than the even-@xmath1 cycle , roughly @xmath141 , but because of the oscillatory nature of @xmath142 , the exact behaviour @xcite is not a smooth function of @xmath43 or @xmath24 . as decoherence on the particle ( or both ) increases , at @xmath135 ,",
    "the mixing time passes through an inflexion and from then on behaves in a quantitatively similar manner to the adjacent - sized even-@xmath1 cycles , including scaling as @xmath137 at the inflexion .",
    "thus for at least @xmath143 the mixing time stays linear in @xmath1 , and exhibits the quantum speed up over the classical @xmath144 .",
    "recalling from sect .",
    "[ ex_hype ] , we are interested in the hitting time to the opposite corner , which was shown by kempe @xcite to be polynomial , an exponential speed up over a classical random walk .",
    "kempe discusses two types of hitting times , one - shot , where a measurement is made after a pre - determined number of steps , and concurrent , where the desired location is monitored continuously to see if the particle has arrived . in each case , the key parameter is the probability @xmath145 of finding the particle at the chosen location .",
    "here we consider only target locations exactly opposite the starting vertex .",
    "we have calculated @xmath145 numerically following the scheme of @xcite with a @xmath1-dimensional coin and the grover coin operator , defined in ( [ grovercoin ] ) .",
    "figure [ dechit ] shows how @xmath145 is affected by decoherence .",
    "all forms of decoherence have a similar effect on @xmath145 , reducing the peaks and smoothing out the troughs .",
    "for the one - shot hitting time this is useful , raising @xmath145 in the trough to well above the classical value , so it is no longer necessary to know exactly when to measure . for @xmath147 , the height of the first peak scales as @xmath148 , where @xmath149 depending on whether coin , particle or both are subject to decoherence .",
    "thus @xmath145 decreases exponentially in @xmath43 , but @xmath150 only lowers @xmath145 by a factor of @xmath151 , still exponentially better than classical .",
    "continuous monitoring of the target location as in the concurrent hitting time is already a type of controlled decoherence , no new features are produced by the addition of unselective decoherence , but there is still a range of @xmath152 within which the quantum speed up is preserved .      for the walk on a line , whilst the effect of decoherence is to reduce the standard deviation rapidly towards the classical value , it is possible to generate highly uniform distributions over a range proportional to @xmath42 for small values of the decoherence parameter , @xmath43 .",
    "uniform sampling is one of the basic tasks for which classical random walks are used , so being able to do this over a quadratically larger range with a quantum walk is certainly promising , though no quantum algorithms using this have been described to date . for a walk on a cycle",
    "the effects of decoherence are more beneficial .",
    "an optimum rate of decoherence exists for which the rate of mixing is enhanced beyond the pure quantum bound .",
    "further , any amount of decoherence removes the effect of the coin flip operator on the steady state , allowing all such walks to converge to a uniform distribution . fast mixing to a uniform distribution is again an important basic property required for efficient random sampling , and is the limiting factor in many classical algorithms . for a hypercube",
    ", decoherence can still be tolerated so long its rate is kept smaller than @xmath153 , which is logarithmic in the system size ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "thus , for both experiments and algorithms , decoherence need only be controlled down to finite low levels , rather than negligible levels , in order to observe the intriguing quantum effects displayed by coined quantum walks .",
    "many open problems remain concerning the best ways to do this , how to exploit the full power of the extra degrees of freedom provided by the quantum coin , and how to make quantum walks perform useful tasks over more general graphs that provide real quantum computational advantages over classical algorithms .",
