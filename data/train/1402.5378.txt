    "in this paper , we introduce a method to evaluate eigenvalues for the some problems of sturm - liouville type .",
    "as this method should be valid in order to obtain the energy levels of some schrdinger equations whose solutions should fulfil given boundary conditions , we were looking for an explicit example of application .",
    "one of the fields of research in physics which has recently received some attention is the study of quantum systems with variable mass @xcite .",
    "situations combining a one dimensional system with a mass jump at one point plus a point potential at the same point have been already studied by our group @xcite . however , our principal aim in these case was looking for solvable or quasi solvable systems with resonances and the systems under the study did not have bound states .",
    "the simple system having a purely discrete spectrum capable to bear a non constant mass seems to be the one dimensional infinite square well .",
    "this is the reason why we have chosen this example in our discussion along the present paper .",

    "a study of these self adjoint extensions and their corresponding energy levels is given in @xcite .",
    "when we introduce a non constant mass a problem arises connected with the non commutation between the position and the momentum . in order to avoid it",
    ", one should replace the usual kinetic term in the hamiltonian @xmath10 by the following symmetric expression :    @xmath11    with with @xmath12 .",
    "thus , our hamiltonian should be @xmath13 with @xmath14 as in ( [ 2 ] ) and @xmath15 as in ( [ 1 ] ) .    however , this situation is too general and we should make one choice being both simple and natural . the choice that looks more natural is probably @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the connection of this choice with the conservation of galilei invariance was discussed in @xcite and on this galilei invariance is already a basis to make it .",
    "assume first that the mass is a differentiable function @xmath18 of the position .",
    "then after a simple calculation , one shows that the time independent schrdinger equation @xmath19 is given inside the interval @xmath20 $ ] by    @xmath21    and zero otherwise . here",
    ", we may use the standard boundary condition at the borders : @xmath22 to obtain solutions of the eigenvalue problem .",

    "these conditions are relations between the left and right limits of the function and its first derivative . then along ( [ 4 ] ) , we can use the continuity of the wave function .",

    "therefore , formula ( [ 12 ] ) given the energy levels is valid if the interval were @xmath49 $ ] instead @xmath50 $ ] , for instance .",
    "we shall take into account this fact in our explicit calculations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we introduce the method for obtaining the energy levels and in section 3 , we compare our method to other methods . in section 4 , we apply our method to a situation in which the dependence of the mass with the position is differentiable .",
    "furthermore , the function of mass depends on an additional parameter @xmath0 such that in the limit @xmath51 we obtain the coordinate dependence of the mass given by @xmath52 , i.e. , a constant mass except for a discontinuity at one point , say @xmath26 .",
    "this is interesting as the energy levels for the continuous distribution of mass converge to the energy levels for the limit case .",
    "along the present section , we shall develop a method to solve numerically the equations that will arise in the problem described here .",
    "these equations are of the of the following type :    @xmath53    this equation depends explicitly of the eigenvalue @xmath54 to be determined , as is exactly the case of the ( time independent ) schrdinger equation . here , @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "we assume that the following conditions hold :    @xmath56    where the constants @xmath57 and @xmath58 , @xmath59 are known . note that this problem is just a generalization of sturm - liouville .    a variety of methods for solving this problem ( ( [ 13 ] ) with ( [ 14 ] ) )",
    "one of the most efficient is the differential transformation method ( dtm)@xcite , which is clearly described in @xcite .",
    "this method is beautiful , elegant and , in many cases , effective .",
    "however , its practical implementation requires numerical determination of roots , a calculation which is sometimes tedious , particularly in the case of non - linear equations .    we are introducing another method to solve numerically ordinary differential equations , which has been suggested to us by our experience in the use of the software mathematica . a version of this method was designed to approximate periodic solutions @xcite .",
    "we hereby describe the method and use it for the numerical study of the infinite square well with a variable mass .",
    "our method is based in the approximation of the solution @xmath60 by means of taylor polynomials whose order depends on the desired degree of accuracy . in order to perform the expansion on the finite taylor series , we need to impose the condition that @xmath61 , where @xmath54 denotes a parameter , be analytic or at least differentiable up to the necessary order on the interval @xmath62 $ ] . contrary to the usual procedure in the dtm",
    ", we do not determine algebraically the coefficients in the taylor polynomial , but instead we calculate them analytically , often with the help of a software for symbolic calculus .",
    "the second difference between our method and the dtm can be explained as follows : when searching for solutions to ode with given boundary conditions we often find periodic solutions which can not be accurately approximated by a unique taylor polynomial on the whole integration interval .",
    "when solving ( [ 13 ] ) subject to conditions ( [ 14 ] ) , this problem has the following cure :    let us divide the integration interval @xmath62 $ ] into @xmath63 subintervals with the same length by taking the points @xmath64 with @xmath65 , @xmath66 . here",
    "the number @xmath63 of subintervals depends on the precision we want .",
    "then , let us write ( [ 13 ] ) as the following system :    @xmath67    then on each interval @xmath68 , we approximate the functions @xmath60 and @xmath69 by respective taylor polynomials as follows :    @xmath70    where we determine the derivatives @xmath71 and @xmath72 by means of ( [ 15 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and so on up to the desired derivative . similarly , we obtain the successive derivatives of @xmath69 .    then , starting with the first equation in ( [ 15 ] ) , we obtain the initial values to obtain @xmath76 and @xmath77 on the interval @xmath78 $ ] , which are parameterized by the eigenvalue @xmath54 .",
    "then , we know the values @xmath79 and @xmath80 which allow us to construct @xmath76 and @xmath77 on the interval @xmath81 $ ] and so on .",
    "after obtaining the approximation for the last interval , we note that the second equation in ( [ 13 ] ) gives us the condition @xmath82 with @xmath83 , which gives an algebraic equation in @xmath54 .",
    "then , the roots of this equation are the eigenvalues we search for .",
    "once we have chosen one of these eigenvalues , the segmentary solutions are well defined .",
    "the values of @xmath84 and @xmath63 should be determined by practice depending on the desired accuracy .    for the above calculations we use the software mathematica .",
    "along the present section , we compare our results to the results obtained by the dtm method as introduced in @xcite .",
    "take for instance a problem considered by chao kuang chen and shing huei ho in @xcite , the differential equation with boundary conditions given by    @xmath85    here , the solution is given by    @xmath86    where @xmath87 is the parabolic cylindric function @xcite of index @xmath88 and @xmath89 is the gamma function . starting with ( [ 18 ] ) and",

    "we have proposed one method to obtain the energy levels of a given hamiltonian with purely discrete spectrum .",
    "we have applied it to calculate the energy levels of the one dimensional infinite square well with variable mass .",
    "the mass is written as a function of position .",
    "we have considered two possibilities , one in which the mass is a continuous and even differentiable function of the position and in the other the mass is constant except for a jump at the middle of the well .",
    "in addition , the continuous function of mass depends on one parameter so that when this parameter goes to infinite the function of mass goes to the second case of constant mass with a jump .",
    "our numerical calculations show that also the energy levels for the continuous mass case go to the energy levels for the mass jump case .",
