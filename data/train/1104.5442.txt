    "dynamical creation of entanglement by the indirect interaction between otherwise decoupled systems has been recently studied by many researchers mainly in the case of two - level atoms interacting with the common vacuum .",
    "the idea that dissipation can create rather then destroy entanglement was put forward in several publications @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the effect of spontaneous emission on the destruction and production of entanglement was discussed @xcite .",
    "when the two atoms are separated by a small distance compared to the radiation wavelength , there is a substantial probability that a photon emitted by one atom will be absorbed by the other , and the resulting process of photon exchange produces correlations between the atoms .",
    "such correlations may cause that initially separable states become entangled .",
    "the case of two atoms immersed in a common thermal reservoir was also investigated @xcite . as was shown in @xcite , similarly to the vacuum case",
    ", the collective properties of the atomic system can alter the decay process compared to the single atom .",
    "there are states with enhanced emission rates and such that the emission rate is reduced .",
    "the important example of the latter is the antisymmetric superposition @xmath0 constructed from energy levels of considered atoms . when the atoms are close to each other , this state is decoupled from the environment and therefore is stable . in that case",
    "the asymptotic states of the system are parametrized by the fidelity @xmath1 of the initial state with respect to the state @xmath0 and the temperature @xmath2 of the photon reservoir .",
    "moreover , the asymptotic states can be identified with thermal generalization of werner states i.e. mixtures of the state @xmath0 and gibbs equilibrium state at the temperature @xmath2 .    in the present paper , we consider the atoms interacting with photon reservoir in a squeezed state @xcite . in practice ,",
    "squeezed light sources produce photon fields in multimode squeezed states , but here we assume broadband approximation in which the parameters characterizing the photon field are constant over a sufficiently broad frequency range .",
    "the dynamics of atoms interacting with squeezed light was studied by many authors ( see e.g. review paper @xcite and references therein ) . in the context of our studies , we mention the result of palma and knight @xcite showing the existence of highly correlated asymptotic state and the analysis of cooperative behavior of atoms in broadband squeezed light in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the asymptotic entanglement of the system of atoms evolving according the master equation considered by tana and ficek @xcite but we allow non - zero detuning between the atomic transition frequency and the carrier frequency of the photon field . in the case of spatially separated atoms studied in details in ref .",
    "@xcite , there exists a unique asymptotic state , but in contrast to the vacuum or thermal reservoirs , this state can be entangled .",
    "however , the produced entanglement is maximal only when the atoms are in resonance with the squeezed photon field .",
    "non - zero detuning significantly diminishes this production .",
    "when the atoms are close to each other , the dynamics of the system radically changes . as in the vacuum or thermal case , the antisymmetric state again decouples from the reservoir , therefore is stable .",
    "the asymptotic states @xmath3 depend on the initial fidelity @xmath1 and parameters describing the reservoir , but non - zero detuning also modifies the matrix elements of @xmath3 .",
    "we show that the asymptotic states can be expressed as a mixture of a separable gibbs state and two pure entangled states : an antisymmetric state @xmath0 and some symmetric superposition of ground and excited levels of the atoms .",
    "this realization of the asymptotic state simplifies for zero detuning and minimum - uncertainty squeezed reservoir to the mixture of @xmath0 and two - atom squeezed state @xcite .",
    "thus in that case , there are two linearly independent stable pure states so that decoherence - free subspace is two - dimensional @xcite .",
    "depending on the initial fidelity , some of the asymptotic states are entangled .",
    "we calculate the amount of the asymptotic entanglement using the concurrence as its measure .",
    "we also show that for initial fidelity greater than some threshold value ( depending on the properties of the reservoir and detuning ) , the asymptotic concurrence is non - zero .",
    "this property is analogous to the thermal reservoir case .",
    "but when the reservoir is in a squeezed state , somehow unexpected result occurs : initial states with small or even zero fidelity become asymptotically entangled .",
    "the possibility of production of entanglement starting from separable states with zero fidelity is very interesting . in this case",
    "the correlations present in a squeezed reservoir are transferred to the atomic system , entangling for example two atoms both in the ground state .",
    "but as before , large detuning between atoms and photon field , destroys this possibility .",
    "consider two - level atoms @xmath4 and @xmath5 with ground states @xmath6 and excited states @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , interacting with the radiation field in a broadband squeezed vacuum state with the carrier frequency @xmath9 .",
    "the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 characterizing the squeezing satisfy @xmath12 where the equality holds for a minimum - uncertainty squeezed state . in the markov approximation the influence of the reservoir on the system of atoms can be described by the dynamical semi - group with the lindblad generator @xcite @xmath13 + l_{{\\mathrm{d}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 here @xmath16 in the hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) , @xmath17 is the frequency of the transition @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 describes interatomic coupling by the dipole - dipole interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "dissipative dynamics is given by the generator ( [ dyss ] ) with parameters @xmath21 satisfying @xmath22 in the above equalities , @xmath23 is the single atom spontaneous emission rate , and @xmath24 is the collective damping constant . in the model considered , @xmath25 is the function of the interatomic distance @xmath26 , and @xmath25 is small for large separation of atoms . on the other hand , @xmath27 when @xmath26 is small ( for more details see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the time evolution of the system of atoms is given by the master equation @xmath28 in the frame rotating with frequency @xmath9 , the master equation ( [ me ] ) becomes an equation with time indendent coefficients , and it may be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30+\\widetilde{l}_{{\\mathrm{d}}},\\ ] ] with @xmath31 and @xmath32 notice that in the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltr ] ) , detuning @xmath33 can be arbitrary . only when the atoms are in resonance with the carrier frequency of the squeezed vacuum , @xmath34 .    from now on",
    "we omit the subscript @xmath35 .",
    "the master equation ( [ mer ] ) can be used to obtain the equations for matrix elements of a state @xmath36 of the system of two - level atoms with respect to some basis . to simplify the calculations one can work in the basis of collective states in the hilbert space @xmath37 @xcite , given by product vectors @xmath38 symmetric superposition @xmath39 and antisymmetric superposition @xmath40 in the basis of collective states , two - atom system can be treated as a single four - level system with ground state @xmath41 , excited state @xmath42 and two intermediate states @xmath43 and @xmath0 . from ( [ mer ] ) it follows that the matrix elements of the state @xmath36 with respect to the basis @xmath44 satisfy the equations which can be grouped into decoupled systems of differential equations .",
