    "<S> it is noteworthy , how accurately the fidelity for abc interpolates between the functions for pbc ( @xmath58 ) and the model with asymmetric mass profile ( @xmath59 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the duality of phases for @xmath60 and @xmath61 implies that in these three cases @xmath24 is symmetric and peaked at zero , the location of the phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for open symmetric boundary conditions , there is no such duality and the reduced fidelity susceptibility is maximal at @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( the shift exponent ) . </S>",
    "<S> for all four cases , eq .   implies a bulk - dominated fidelity susceptibility as long as ( @xmath65 of order unity ) @xmath66 in the ising universality class , the rounding exponent is @xmath67 . while our result for the exponents @xmath68 and @xmath69 conform with the finite size scaling theory of thermodynamic quantities  @xcite the value of @xmath70 is remarkable inasmuch as other observables , such as the groundstate energy  @xcite suggest @xmath71 for the transition point . as we noted above , @xmath72 is the point in parameter space beyond which nondispersive edge states exist . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , at @xmath73 the two edge states decouple , i.e.  their decay length becomes comparable to the system size  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one should keep in mind that , formally , phase transitions are defined in the thermodynamic limit , in which both @xmath74 and @xmath75 approach zero .    </S>",

    "<S> the `` pseudo - spins '' tend to be oriented in opposite directions depending on the sign of the mass . </S>",
    "<S> close to the transition the applied `` field '' is weak and thus the `` pseudo - spins '' are more susceptible to changes in the `` field '' and the fidelity smaller ( @xmath76 larger ) . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , boundary constraints which are more invasive than pbc generally lead to decoherence of the spin polarization and therefore the fidelity susceptibility is larger . for the symmetric mass profile , however </S>",

    "<S> open boundary conditions imply a node in the dispersing wave functions at the end of , e.g. , the ssh chain . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , at the boundary , the form of the wave function is nearly independent of the dimerization and on the topologically trivial side the fidelity in an open system is larger than for pbc . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , on the nontrivial side , the boundary contribution is strongly influenced by edge states . </S>",
    "<S> these are susceptible to changes in the dimerization and therefore the boundary contribution to @xmath76 is positive . </S>",

    "<S> * _ conclusion and outlook . </S>",
    "<S> _ * in this article we derived and discussed the scaling function for the fidelity susceptibility in finite systems close to 1d ising qpts . to this end , we employed the critical continuum theory of 1d dirac fermions subjected to four different types of boundary conditions : open boundary conditions allowing for one or two subgap states as well as periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity susceptibility close to the transition is smallest for pbc , i.e. in the case of the putatively least invasive constraint . </S>",
    "<S> the situation when the boundary conditions allow for two subgap states strongly differs from all others : only in this case are the two phases not dual to each other and , as a result , the fidelity susceptibility is not symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> the peak value of the reduced fidelity susceptibility defines a critical mass @xmath77 , which differs from the critical mass obtained by other means  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our theory applies to topological phase transitions in which the winding number changes by one . </S>",
    "<S> this is because we considered the gap closing of a single dirac fermion . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , a theory of @xmath78 dirac fermions applies to certain transitions where the topological winding changes by @xmath78 . in the absence of scattering between different dirac valleys , </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity susceptibility is the sum of the expressions reported in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> since this study was devoted to the universal scaling function of the fidelity susceptibility for 1d dirac fermions one may wonder about a similar function in higher dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a universal function should not exist , inasmuch as the fidelity susceptibility is expected to depend on the ultraviolet cut - off for @xmath79  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the generalization of our results to the case of arbitrary @xmath80 in eq .   would reveal further experimentally accessible insights on the orthogonality catastrophe and the role of edge states . specifically , the overlap function of groundstates on different sides of the transition vanishes for pbc , but not in the case of other boundary conditions  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , more theoretical work is needed to relate our results for the fidelity susceptibility in finite ising systems to quantities studied in experiments or by other theoretical methods , such as ( boundary ) conformal field theory . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the connection between the fidelity and boundary entropy of certain conformally invariant , finite ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional systems was shown in ref .  </S>",
