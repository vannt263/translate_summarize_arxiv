    "<S> the dihedral angle distributions in the simulations with the generalized - ensemble algorithms had a small peak in @xmath103 and @xmath104 , although there was no peak in the range in the distribution of the conventional simulations . </S>",
    "<S> all the simulations with the three generalized - ensemble algorithms were able to provide the same results and reproduce the distribution obtained previously in refs . </S>",
    "<S> 43 and 44 .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we presented the extensions of muca , rem , and st for isobaric - isothermal molecular simulations . </S>",
    "<S> these algorithms can be effective methods for conformational sampling and give accurate physical quantities in the isobaric - isothermal ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one can use the generalized - ensemble algorithms to study temperature and pressure effects on complex systems such as biomolecular systems .    </S>",
    "<S> we expect the simulated tempering to be a more useful method for simulations in large systems . </S>",
    "<S> many replicas are needed in rem simulations of large systems , while only one replica is used in st simulations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , st can be easily implemented into existing program packages compared to muca ( or mubath ) , in which a force calculation part of programs has to be modified for md simulations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , molecular simulations with st will be more easily applicable to larger systems than with the other two generalized - ensemble algorithms . </S>"
