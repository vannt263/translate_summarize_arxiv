    "gravitational lens systems provide the opportunity to study in detail the properties of distant galaxies through the magnification provided by lensing .",
    "models of these systems also provide insight into the underlying mass distribution in the foreground lens .",
    "new samples of strong lenses have been enabled by the sloan digital sky survey @xcite with systems initially discovered in the sdss _ spectroscopic _ data @xcite . because of the nature of the selection these are smaller separation systems ( @xmath5 , the width of the sdss fiber radius ) consisting of a single luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) lensing a background source galaxy . an additional parameter space to discover strong lenses",
    "is also provided by the sdss _ imaging _ data , and a number of complementary programs are now underway in the sdss to search for these systems @xcite . because of the moderate imaging quality ( 1.4fwhm in r ) in the sdss these systems typically have a larger lens - arc separation ( @xmath6 ) which is outside of the regime probed by the sdss spectroscopic lens survey .",
    "motivated by the discovery of the 8 oclock arc @xcite , the brightest lensed lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) currently known @xmath7 , we have also initiated a program to systematically search for strong lens systems in the sdss .",
    "our program is focused on searching for lensed high redshift galaxies in particular @xmath8 lensed lbg s similar to the 8 oclock arc .",
    "since fall 2006 we have been following up candidate systems with imaging and spectroscopy using the 3.5 m telescope at apache point observatory ( apo ) in new mexico .",
    "the first lensed system discovered in our systematic search , a lensed lbg at @xmath9 which we named the ` clone ' , was recently reported in @xcite .",
    "in addition to these lensed high redshift galaxies we are also discovering a number of interesting lensed galaxies at lower redshift . in this paper",
    "we present our first results on six of these lower - redshift systems which we have spectroscopically confirmed to be lensed galaxies , ranging in redshift from @xmath3 .",
    "this letter is organized as follows : details of initial candidate selection and follow - up imaging / spectroscopy are described in @xmath10 .",
    "preliminary mass models of each system are presented in @xmath11 . in @xmath12",
    "we summarize our work and describe future directions of our survey . throughout",
    "we assume a standard cosmology of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the sdss is an 8000 square degree spectroscopic and imaging survey using a dedicated 2.5 m telescope at apo @xcite .",
    "we searched for candidate strong lens systems using two systematic searches on the sdss data release five ( dr5 ) @xcite .",
    "our first candidate list was generated using the sdss catalog archive server ( cas ) database .",
    "as described in @xcite and @xcite we performed two separate queries which searched for blue objects ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) around a catalog of 221,000 luminous red galaxies ( lrg s ) @xcite and around a catalog of @xmath17 bright cluster galaxies ( bcg s ) based on the maxbcg cluster finder algorithm @xcite .",
    "we separated systems into groups depending on the number of blue objects found around each lrg or bcg where the number of blue objects , _",
    "n _ , was 2 , 3 , or @xmath18 .",
    "each list was visually inspected by four separate inspectors .",
    "based on their morphology , candidates were then ranked on their likelihood of being an arc . the most promising systems in this search were chosen for follow - up .",
    "three confirmed systems discovered in this search are presented in @xmath11 .",
    "our second list of candidates is generated from a catalog of merging galaxies using the method described in @xcite .",
    "this method was used in the initial discovery of the 8 oclock arc @xcite . in this technique a candidate merging galaxy pair is defined as two galaxies in the magnitude range @xmath19 separated by less than the sum of their respective petrosian radii @xcite .",
    "this algorithm was run on imaging data from the sdss dr6 and the resulting catalog was visually examined and classified .",
    "lensing candidates were flagged by the algorithm if their morpholgies and colors were similar to a strong lens .",
    "three of these systems have been spectroscopically confirmed to be strong lens systems and are discussed in @xmath11 .",
    "we followed - up candidates with both imaging and spectroscopy using the apo 3.5 m telescope .",
    "imaging is obtained with the spicam ccd imager which has a field of view of @xmath20 and a plate scale of @xmath21 per pixel . each target in our program is imaged in three sdss filters @xmath22 each with @xmath23 dithered exposures . as described in @xcite images are reduced using standard iraf tasks , and are co - added using the swarp package @xcite .",
    "the spicam images are photometrically calibrated by matching unsaturated stars in the co - added images to the photometry in the sdss .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy of candidate arcs was performed with the dual imaging spectrograph ( dis iii ) , a medium dispersion double spectrograph which has separate red and blue channels .",
    "we used the standard medium red / low blue grating setup which covers a spectral range of @xmath24 with a resolution of @xmath25 per pixel in the blue and @xmath26 per pixel in the red .",
    "each arc in our sample was targeted with an exposure time of @xmath27 .",
    "we used a @xmath28 or @xmath29 slit which was typically oriented along the brightest segment of each arc in order to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "spectra were also reduced using standard iraf tasks , described further in @xcite .",
    "dates for all of our follow - up observations with spicam and dis are summarized in table [ tab : log ] .",
    "using the search techniques described in @xmath30 we have followed - up and confirmed a sample of six strong lens systems . in figures [ fig : arcs1 ] and [ fig : arcs2 ] ( top row ) we show color composite images of these six systems derived from our spicam @xmath22 imaging .",
    "most systems have only a single visible arc , with the exception of @xmath31 which has a visible second arc .",
    "the lens - arc separation in the systems range from @xmath32 indicating that the lens galaxies are not isolated galaxies .",
    "the color spicam imaging reveals several nearby galaxies in most of the systems indicating that these lenses are likely in groups or poor cluster environments .",
    "unfortunately the resolution of our spicam imaging is relatively poor @xmath33 so detailed models of the systems are not possible .",
    "instead we adopt a simple model typically used to measure cluster scale lenses @xcite where we assume that each system can be described by a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) .",
    "the einstein radius of an sis is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the angular diameter distance between the lens - source and @xmath36 is the angular diameter distance to the source . as in @xcite , we estimate the einstein radius from the measured lens - arc separation and knowing the lens and source redshift in each system we can calculate the velocity dispersion .",
    "the resulting velocity dispersions are given in table [ tab : lensmodel ] which range from @xmath37 @xmath38 , typical for group scale objects .",
    "we also estimate the corresponding mass within the einstein radius of each system from @xmath39    below we briefly comment on each individual system , but we note here that redshifts of four of the systems rely on a single strong emission line seen in the red dis spectrum . in each case",
    "the line is best interpreted as [ oii ] 3727 , whereas if the line were @xmath40 or [ oiii ] 5007 , we do not see the expected strong [ oii ] 3727 in the blue spectrum .",
    "similarly , if the line were lyman alpha at high redshifts @xmath41 , the arc would have dropped out from the g - band image due to the redshifted lyman break .",
    "@xmath42 has been previously reported on by @xcite but also independently appeared in our @xmath43 sample in our search around lrg s .",
    "the system consists of two foreground lrg s , the brightest of which , sdss j103843.58 + 484917.7 , has a spectroscopic redshift of @xmath44 from the sdss database .",
    "the system contains two prominent arcs shown in figure [ fig : arcs1 ] .",
    "we independently obtained dis spectroscopy of the bright knot along the southern arc segment ( the g knot in @xcite ) and measured the redshifted [ oii ] 3727 line shown in figure [ fig : arcs1 ] .",
    "this places the primary arc at a redshift of @xmath45 which is in excellent agreement with the redshift reported by @xcite .",
    "we did not obtain a spectroscopic redshift of the second arc , which @xcite noted is likely a different lensed source galaxy .",
    "we estimate an einstein radius for this system of @xmath46 which gives a velocity dispersion of @xmath47 km @xmath1 and an enclosed mass of @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 was selected from our @xmath50 sample in our search around bcg s .",
    "the system contains one bcg with a spectroscopic redshift of @xmath51 from the sdss database , with a small blue @xmath52 arc ( @xmath53 ) to the east ( figure [ fig : arcs1 ] ) . in our follow - up dis spectroscopy of the blue arc",
    "we identify five strong emission lines , specifically [ oii ] 3727 , @xmath54 , [ oiii ] 4959 , [ oiii ] 5007 , and @xmath40 ( figure [ fig : arcs1 ] ) from which we obtain a secure redshift of @xmath55 .",
    "the relative strength of the [ oiii ] doublet is in the expected 1:3 ratio .",
    "the source galaxy is the lowest redshift arc in our entire sample , but the lensing hypothesis is still valid .",
    "we estimate an einstein radius of @xmath56 for this system , which gives a velocity dispersion of @xmath57 km @xmath1 and an enclosed mass of @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 was identified from the merging galaxy catalog described in @xmath30 and is a small group consisting of one lrg and two bright red galaxies ( @xmath60 from east to west ) with a bright @xmath61 long arc to the southeast ( figure [ fig : arcs1 ] ) .",
    "the sdss database places the redshift of the lrg at @xmath62 ( table [ tab : lensmodel ] ) .",
    "redshifts of the two red galaxies are unknown but have the same color as the lrg and are therefore likely at the same redshift . for spectroscopic confirmation we oriented the slit along the brightest segment of the arc and measure redshifted [ oii ] 3727 emission line in the dis spectrum ( figure [ fig : arcs1 ] ) .",
    "this places the redshift of arc at @xmath63 , confirming this as a lens system .",
    "the deeper spicam imaging also reveals a possible fainter extension of the arc to the west but spectra of this portion of the arc was not measured .",
    "the measured einstein angle of the system is @xmath64 which corresponds to a @xmath65 km @xmath1 and an enclosed mass of @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67 was also selected from our merging galaxy catalog .",
    "the system is comprised of a single lrg at @xmath68 with a blue arc located to the east . in the sdss",
    "imaging the arc is split into two knots , the brightest @xmath69 with @xmath70 and a fainter knot @xmath71 with @xmath72 ( figure [ fig : arcs2 ] ) .",
    "the fainter knot is misclassified by the sdss database as a star .",
    "dis spectroscopy of the source was measured along the bright knot and we obtain a redshift @xmath73 based on a strong [ oii ] 3727 emission line ( figure [ fig : arcs2 ] ) .",
    "this single emission line is corroborated by a number of mg and fe absorption features commonly observed in the optical spectra of galaxies at similar redshifts , e.g. , see fig . 9 of @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure 3 , we see strong absorption due to mgii 2798 , mgii 2803 , mgi 2852 , feii 2586 , and feii 2600 , as well as weaker absorption from feii 2344 , feii 2374 , and feii 2382 , all at @xmath74 , consistent with the [ oii ] 3727 redshift . in addition , we also see strong absorption from feii 2586,2600 and mgii 2798 , 2803 from an apparent second source galaxy at @xmath75 . as far as we can tell from our dis spectroscopy ( done under @xmath76 seeing ) , there is no spatial separation between the @xmath77 and @xmath75 absorption features , and we will need spectroscopy under better seeing conditions in order to improve the spatial resolution . given the present data , we interpret this system as two sources , with redshifts @xmath73 and @xmath78 , both being lensed by a foreground lrg at @xmath79 .",
    "as the bulk of the spectroscopic features are at @xmath80 , we adopt that value in the velocity dispersion calculation . for this system",
    "we measure an einstein radius of @xmath81 , which gives a corresponding @xmath82 km @xmath1 and an enclosed mass of @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath84 was discovered in our search around sdss lrg s and fell into our @xmath50 sample .",
    "it consists of a foreground lrg with a spectroscopic redshift from the sdss database of @xmath85 , with an extended blue arc ( @xmath84 ) directed to the south ( figure [ fig : arcs2 ] ) .",
    "the arc contains three bright knots having a total estimated length of @xmath86 . for spectroscopic",
    "follow - up we oriented the slit along the brightest segment of the arc and measured the redshifted [ oii ] 3727 emission line ( figure [ fig : arcs2 ] ) .",
    "this places the arc at a redshift of @xmath87 , confirming this as a lens system .",
    "we estimate the einstein radius for the system to be @xmath88 which gives a velocity dispersion of @xmath89 km @xmath1 assuming an sis model .",
    "this corresponds to an enclosed mass of @xmath90 .      our final system ,",
    "@xmath91 was also selected from our merging galaxy catalog and contains one primary lrg with a bright ( r=19.09 ) blue arc to the west .",
    "a spectroscopic redshift for the lrg is not available in the sdss database as its magnitude ( @xmath92 ) is too faint to be included in the main spectroscopic survey .",
    "we have obtained dis spectroscopy of the lrg showing strong absorption features that yield a redshift of @xmath93 ( not shown ) . for the blue arc",
    "we measure the redshifted [ oii ] 3727 emission line shown in figure [ fig : arcs2 ] , which places the arc at a redshift @xmath94 , confirming this as a lens system . from our estimate of the einstein radius ( @xmath95 )",
    "this gives a velocity dispersion of @xmath96 km @xmath1 and an enclosed mass of @xmath97 .",
    "we note that the sdss imaging also indicates a small companion galaxy which is embedded within the brighter lrg , however at our current imaging resolution we can not estimate its magnitude .",
    "we have presented six confirmed group - scale strong lenses from our search program in the sdss . although the focus of our survey is to confirm high redshift @xmath98 lensed galaxies similar to the 8 oclock arc @xcite and the clone @xcite we are discovering a number of lensed galaxies lying at lower redshift .",
    "these systems were initially discovered via two systematic searches of the sdss dr5 database and from a separate search of a catalog of candidate merging galaxies .",
    "the arcs in our confirmed systems are relatively bright @xmath99 , making them ideal candidates for detailed follow - up studies .",
    "our initial follow - up apo spicam imaging has relatively poor resolution but preliminary modeling indicates that these systems are group - scale lenses , an intermediate regime between isolated galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "this is a relatively new regime that imaging surveys are just beginning to probe with strong lensing @xcite .",
    "additional high resolution imaging will allow for more detailed models of these systems which will yield precise measurements of the mass distribution in the lens and detailed studies of the source galaxy in each system .",
    "future papers in this series will describe our sample of confirmed lensed @xmath100 galaxies as well as the results of our ongoing follow - up programs using hst , spitzer , and other telescopes .",
