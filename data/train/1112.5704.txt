    "the circadian clock is one of the most remarkable cyclic behaviors ubiquitous to the known forms of life , ranging from the unicellular to the multicellular level  including prokaryotes . because of its importance",
    ", the underlying chemical reactions have been the subject academic interest for a long time and have recently been elucidated experimentally .",
    "circadian clocks have three important features : + 1 .",
    "they persist in the absence of external cues with an approximately 24-h period , which is rather long compared with most chemical reactions .",
    "they can be reset by exposure to external stimuli such as changes in illumination ( dark / light ) or temperature .",
    "the period of the circadian clock is robustly maintained across a range of physiological temperatures .",
    "( temperature compensation ) @xcite .",
    "the emergence of cyclic behavior with a capacity for entrainment is theoretically understood as being result of the existence of a limit - cycle attractor in a class of dynamical systems described by chemical rate equations .",
    "however , the phenomenon of temperature compensation is not yet fully understood .",
    "generally , the rate of chemical reactions depends strongly on the temperature .",
    "most biochemical reactions , in particular , have an energy barrier that must be outcome with the aid of enzymes , and thus the rate can be expected to follow the arrhenius form .",
    "thus , the period of chemical or biochemical oscillators can be expected to strongly depend on the temperature @xcite .",
    "thus , the ubiquitous temperature - compensation ability of biological circadian clocks , suggests that there may be some common mechanism(s ) behind it .",
    "overall , there are two possibilities : one is that compensation exists at each elementary step , and the other is that compensation occurs at the system level  for the total set of enzymatic reactions .",
    "recently , it was found that the rates of some elementary reaction steps in circadian clocks depend only slightly on temperature @xcite , suggesting that the activation energy barrier of some reactions is rather low .",
    "although some element - level compensation is important , it is difficult to imagine that every reaction step is fully temperature - compensated at the single - molecule level . indeed ,",
    "if that were the case , temperature changes would not influence the oscillation of chemical concentrations at all .",
    "however , even though the period of oscillation is generally insensitive to temperature changes , it is known that the amplitude changes indeed depend on temperature @xcite . furthermore , circadian clocks are known to entrain to external temperature cycles , and they can be reset by temperature cues @xcite . thus , although temperature changes can influence the oscillation , the period is still robust .",
    "hence , it is necessary to search for a general logic that underlies the temperature compensation phenomenon at the system level .",
    "indeed , several models have been proposed @xcite . in most of the studies ,",
    "several processes that are responsible for the period are considered , which cancel out the temperature dependence with each other . with such balance mechanism ,",
    "the temperature compensation is achieved .",
    "these mechanisms , however , need fine - tuned set of parameters , or rather ad - hoc combination of processes for the cancellation . considering the ubiquity of temperature compensation ,",
    "a generic and robust mechanism that dose not require tuning parameters is desirable .",
    "here we propose such a mechanism that has general validity for any biochemical oscillator consisting of several reaction processes catalyzed by enzymes .",
    "the mechanism can be briefly outlined as follows :    biochemical clocks comprise multiple processes , such as phosphorylation and dephosphorylation , with each generally having a different activation energy barrier @xmath0 .",
    "the rate of such reactions , then , is proportional to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 as the concentration of `` free '' enzyme available .",
    "if the enzyme concentration were insensitive to temperature , the rate would just agree with the simple arrhenius form , thus implying high temperature dependence .",
    "now , consider a situation where several substrates share the same enzyme . at lower temperature",
    ", the reactions with higher activation energy will be slower and the substrates involved in these reactions will accumulate . then , because they share the same enzyme , competition for the enzyme will also increase .",
    "accordingly , the concentration of available ( free ) enzyme decreases , and when it reaches a level satisfying @xmath3 , these enzymatic reactions will be highly suppressed .",
    "the system spends most of its time under such conditions , which limits the rate .",
    "thus , the arrhenius - type temperature dependence is compensated for by the concentration of available enzyme as @xmath3 .",
    "although this is a rather basic description , its validity may suggest that temperature compensation emerges in any general chemical oscillation consisting of steps , catalyzed by a common enzyme . here , we first study the validity of this enzyme - limited temperature compensation mechanism for the specific case of kai protein clock model introduced by van zon et al .",
    "@xcite to explain the circadian clock of kaiabc proteins in cyanobacteria , which was discovered by kondo and his colleagues @xcite indeed , in this system , the period of circadian oscillation of kai proteins is temperature compensated @xcite .",
    "further , some of the elementary components in this system , specifically , kaic s atpase activity and kaic s phosphatase activity , were suggested to depend only slightly on temperature @xcite , but the origin of system - level temperature compensation has not yet been explained . here , we show numerically that system - level temperature compensation emerges from the differences in activation energy between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and competition for kaia as the enzyme that catalyzes kaic phosphorylation .",
    "furthermore , we elucidate the conditions necessary for this temperature compensation to work . then , based on this analysis , we introduce a simpler model consisting of few catalytic reactions , to illustrate the above mechanism .",
    "possible relations between our results and reported experimental findings for circadian clocks are also discussed .",
    "the kai - protein - based circadian clock , discovered by kondo s group consists of kaia , kaib , kaic proteins with atp as an energy source @xcite .",
    "kaic has a hexameric structure with six monomers , each with two phosphorylation sites @xcite .",
    "it has both self - kinase activity and self - phosphatase activity , but the self - phosphatase activity is usually stronger , and so it is spontaneously dephosphorylated @xcite .",
    "kaia , in a dimer form @xcite , attaches to kaic and thus increases its kinase activity , leading to phosphorylation of kaic @xcite , while kaib inhibits the activity of kaia @xcite .",
    "this phosphorylation / dephosphorylation process of the kaiabc proteins constitutes a circadian rhythm . here",
    ", we simplify the process , to focus on the temperature compensation of the period .",
    "we reduce the two phosphorylation residues to just one , because abundance of singly phosphorylated kaic is strongly correlated with that of doubly phosphorylated kaic @xcite so that the phosphorylation of the two residues are equilibrated on a rather short time scale .",
    "next , we do not include kaib explicitly in our model , because changes in the concentration of kaib affect the period only slightly @xcite .",
    "note that although kaib is necessary to generate circadian oscillations , the effect can be accounted for by introducing a parameter value for kaia activity . here , we adopt a slightly simplified version of the model introduced by van zon , et al .",
    "@xcite(see also @xcite )    first , each kaic monomer has two states  active and inactive .",
    "second , allosterically regulated kaic hexamers in the active state can be phosphorylated , whereas those in the inactive state can be dephosphorylated .",
    "a phosphorylated kaic monomer energetically prefers the inactive state , whereas a dephosphorylated kaic has the opposite tendency . here",
    "the flip - flop transition between active and inactive states occurs only from the fully phosphorylated or fully dephosphorylated states , as assumed in the concerted mwc model @xcite .",
    "no intermediate states are assumed .",
    "hence , the reaction process exhibits a cyclic structure as in fig .",
    "1 .    , while in the inactive state , dephosphorylation progresses without any enzymes at the rate @xmath4 .",
    "affinity between active kaic and kaia reduces as the number of phosphorylated sites of kaic increases successively .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]     next , kaia facilitates phosphorylation of active kaic with an affinity that depends on the number of phosphorylated residues of each kaic hexamer . kaics with a smaller phosphorylation number have stronger affinity to kaia and are phosphorylated faster .",
    "this assumption is necessary for generating stable oscillations @xcite .",
    "then , the reactions are given by    @xmath5    @xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8 { } } } ac_i \\xrightarrow{k_p } c_{i+1 } + a\\ ] ]    here @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the concentrations of active kaic and inactive kaic , respectively , with @xmath11 phosphorylated sites ; @xmath12 denotes the concentration of free kaia dimer . to study the temperature compensation of the period , we must also account for the temperature dependence of the reaction rate . here , the rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are governed by the arrhenius equation",
    ". then the rate constants @xmath4 and @xmath13 are as follows :    @xmath14    @xmath15     + with inverse temperature @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) by taking the unit of boltzmann constant as unity .",
    "we could include the temperature dependence of the rates @xmath18 and @xmath19 in a similar manner , but as the reaction between active and inactive states progresses faster and does not influence the period @xcite , this dependence is neglected .",
    "van zon et al . demonstrated that temperature compensation occurs when the speed of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is completely temperature - compensated at a level of elementary reaction process .",
    "however , it can not explain why the amplitude of oscillation depends on temperature , or the entrainment to temperature cycle occurs .",
    "the compensation mechanism at a system - level is wanted . here ,",

    "there is also a clear difference in the amplitude of oscillation below and above @xmath31 . at higher temperature ( without temperature compensation ) , the amplitude of oscillation is almost constant over a large interval of temperatures .",
    "however , at lower temperature ( in the temperature - compensated phase ) , the amplitude decreases with lowering of temperature ; eventually , the oscillation disappears via hopf bifurcation .",
    "this decrease in amplitude is due to the increase in the minimum value of the kaic phosphorylation level , caused by the increase in the minimum abundances of @xmath27 .",
    "the temperature dependences of the abundance of each kaic and free kaia also show distinct behaviors below and above @xmath31 ( see fig . 4 , supplementary fig .",

    "( b ) effect of kaia increase on the period .",
    "an increase in kaia led to narrowing of the range of the periodic solution , and also the range of temperatures at which temperature compensation occurs .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]     as already mentioned by von zon et al .",
    ", oscillation of kaic abundance requires that the amount of kaia is less than that of kaic @xcite .",
    "an increase in kaia abundance leads to decrease in the period , finally leading to no oscillations .",
    "the range of temperatures where the oscillations exist narrows as kaia abundance increases , and the oscillation disappears at higher temperatures . here",

    "5b ) . furthermore",
    ", the temperature compensation at @xmath53 is lost kaia abundance is increased .",
    "although the temperature dependence of the period is weaker at @xmath53 , the dependence @xmath54 still exists with @xmath55 smaller than @xmath23 .",
    "we plotted the range where temperature compensation occurs at @xmath53 in the two - dimensional plane with kaia abundances and @xmath56 .",
    "we see that low level of kaia abundance is necessary for temperature compensation .",
    "since kaic is a hexamer , we adopted six phosphorylation sites in our model .",
    "however , to understand the biological significance of this number of sites , we examine models with a reduced number of phosphorylation sites ( supplementary fig .",
    "we find that reducing the number of phosphorylation sites from hexamer to pentamer , and then to tetramer , narrows the temperature range where oscillations exist and temperature compensation occurs .",

    "are entrained by the temperature cycle between @xmath57 and 1.7 within about 10 cycles .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]     it has been experimentally it is suggested that kaic s phosphorylation cycle is entrained to external temperature cycle @xcite . to examine such entrainment , we cycle the temperature between @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( i.e. , within the region in the temperature compensation ) periodically in time with a period close to that of the kai system ( 27 h ) . within about 10 cycles ,",
    "the phase of oscillation of the kaic system is entrained with that of temperature , independently of the initial phase of oscillation .",
    "thus , entrainment to temperature cycle is achieved ( see fig .",
    "here we discuss how temperature compensation is achieved .",
    "as presented in the results section , two stages are necessary : transition in the temperature dependence of the period , and complete temperature compensation of the period at lower temperature . as seen in the phase diagram ( fig .",
    "5a ) , the former requires that @xmath23 is sufficiently larger than @xmath24 , which , as will be shown , means that the phosphorylation process is rate limited . for the latter , the abundance of kaia should be sufficiently small so that there is limited free kaia that can be used for phosphorylation ( i.e. , competition for free kaia ) .",
    "as will be shown below , the abundance of free kaia decreases as the temperature increases , which compensates for the increase in the rate constant of the reaction .",
    "phase transition    when there is a difference between the energy barriers for phosphorylation and dephosphorylation , the temperature dependence of the rate of each processes is different . roughly speaking , the time scale for the phosphorylation process changes in proportion to @xmath59 , whereas the dephosphorylation has @xmath60 , where @xmath12 is the concentration of free kaia .",
    "thus , there exists a characteristic temperature at which the two rates are comparable ; the rate - limited reaction switches at this temperature , where the phase transition to temperature dependence occurs .",
    "thus ,    @xmath61    where @xmath12 , the concentration of free kaia , is estimated from the steady - state solution of our model ( see eq.([a ] ) ) to afford @xmath62 if @xmath63 and @xmath64 if @xmath65 .",
    "thus , a sufficient difference in activation energy is necessary for the phase transition - like behavior because the critical temperature will diverge as @xmath66 .",
    "if the difference is small , the critical temperature goes beyond the temperature for the onset of oscillation and the transition never occurs .",
    "moreover , if @xmath49 is too large or too small , the critical temperature is lower or higher than the range where the oscillation exists , and thus for both the cases , the phase transition disappears .",
    "these estimates agree with the phase diagram in fig . 5a .",
    "temperature compensation by self - adjustment of the kaia concentration    when the temperature is lower than the transition temperature , the phosphorylation process takes more time , and @xmath27 is accumulated before dephosphorylation from @xmath43 progresses , as already discussed ( see fig.2b ) .",
    "the increase in the abundance of active kaic leads to competition for kaia , and thus a decrease in free kaia .",
    "if the total kaia abundance is limited , the system reaches a stage where phosphorylation almost stops .",
    "this leads to the plateau in the time course of @xmath27 , as observed in fig .",
    "this drastic slow down of the phosphorylation process occurs when @xmath12 is decreased to the level at @xmath67 .",
    "thus , during the plateau in @xmath27 , this approximate estimate gives , @xmath68 , so that the temperature dependence of the phosphorylation rate @xmath69 is compensated for by the decrease in @xmath12 .",
    "this plateau region is rate - limited in the circadian cycle , making the whole period independent of temperature .    in more detail",
    ", this compensation is also estimated as follows .",
    "the abundances of the inactive forms of kaic decrease with an increase in @xmath27 . considering the differences in speed between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation , the total inactive kaic abundance ( at the fixed point )",
    "is estimated as    @xmath70     + which is consistent with fig .",
    "the flow from inactive kaic is thus estimated by    @xmath71    this flow starts the phosphorylation processes from @xmath72 , but is slowed down at some residue number @xmath73 . in the present model ,",
    "this slow down starts at @xmath74 due to the paucity of free kaia . following the above estimate of flow , the maximum @xmath75",
    "is estimated to be proportional to @xmath76 .",
    "now from eq.([a ] ) and @xmath77 @xmath78 and @xmath79 @xmath80 at this time , the abundance of free kaia can be estimated approximately as @xmath81 when @xmath49 is small enough , the minimum free kaia abundance is smaller than @xmath82,thus @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath84    therefore , when @xmath49 is small enough and @xmath23 is sufficiently greater than @xmath24 , the time scale of the phosphorylation process is @xmath85 , and the period of the cycle is temperature - compensated . indeed , as shown in supplementary fig .",
    "2 , the maximum @xmath86 ( and @xmath87 ) values show @xmath76 dependence , whereas free kaia shows approximately @xmath41 dependence when the phosphorylation is slowed down .    in essence , the temperature compensation mechanism requires two properties : + difference in activation energy between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation processes , and a limited abundance of enzyme kaia .",
    "the former is essential to the phase transition , and the latter to the compensation of the arrhenius - type by the temperature dependence of the individual reactions .",
    "as long as these conditions are met , the period is temperature - compensated at low temperature , without the need for fine tuning of the parameters of the system .",
    "these two properties generally appear if there are two types of processes with different activation energy , with one type catalyzed by a common enzyme and the other without catalyzation .",
    "if the enzyme abundance is limited , the competition for the enzyme will lead to temperature compensation in cyclic reaction systems . in particular , if the main component of the chemical reactions has allosteric structure like kaic , the competition for enzymes will occur naturally .",
    "are catalyzed by the same enzyme @xmath88 , but the other reactions are not .",
    "the affinity between @xmath89 and @xmath88 weaken as @xmath11 increases .",
    "( b ) maximum and minimum values of @xmath90 over a cycle and ( c ) the period , plotted against the inverse temperature @xmath16 .",
    "the oscillation is temperature - compensated over a specific range of temperatures , although the transition is not as sharp as in the kai model . , title=\"fig : \" ]     as an example , we consider the cyclic process shown in fig . 7 , where a cyclic change in five substrates occurs",
    ". three processes@xmath91have a high activation energy barrier , and are catalyzed by the common enzyme @xmath88 . in this case , the period of the oscillation in the concentration of each substrate is temperature - compensated at low temperature .",
    "( if the number of reactions with the common enzyme is decreased to two , compensation still appears , but it is weaker , as shown in supplementary fig . 5 ) .",
    "this example demonstrates the generality of the present mechanism , and opens the possibility of applications to temperature compensation in other biochemical oscillations as well .",
    "the regulation of reaction process by autonomous changes in enzyme concentration , as adopted here , was previously pointed out by awazu and kaneko , who reported that relaxation to equilibrium slowes down when the concentrations of substrate and enzymes are negatively correlated @xcite . excess substrate hinders the enzymatic reaction , leading to a plateau in relaxation dynamics . in the present model , the total concentration of kaia as an enzyme is a conserved quantity but the fraction of free kaia available",
    "is reduced when there is abundant active kaic and so the speed of phosphorylation slows down dramatically .",
    "such regulation of reaction speed by limitation of catalysts should be important , not only for the temperature compensation of circadian clocks in general , but also for other biological processes @xcite .",
    "now we briefly discuss the relevance of the present results to experiments on the kai protein circadian system . in our model",
    ", it is assumed that kaic s affinity to kaia depends on the phosphorylation levels .",
    "this assumption is necessary not only for the emergence of temperature compensation but also for the existence of the oscillation itself .",
    "recent reports that kaic phosphorylation induces conformational changes may account for such changes in the binding affinity .    in the actual circadian clock comprising kai proteins ,",
    "kaib is also involved besides kaia and kaic . however , as mentioned , an increase in kaib abundance has minor influence on the clock @xcite .",
    "earlier theoretical study suggested that kaib binds to kaiac complexes strongly and restricts the concentration of free kaia @xcite .",
    "thus , the inclusion of kaib is expected to not alter the present temperature compensation mechanism , but to facilitate it by strengthening the limitation of enzyme availability .",
    "note that previously reported temperature compensation at element - level ",
    "kaic s atpase activity @xcite and auto - dephosphorylation activity @xcite is also relevant to the system - level compensation in our model .",
    "the former is relevant to achieve fast equilibration between kaia and kaia complex used for adiabatic elimination in eq.([a ] ) , and the latter to provide @xmath92 .",
    "it is known that the amplitude of kaic oscillation decreases as the temperature is lowered @xcite , which agrees well with our results ( fig .",
    "2a ) . indeed ,",
    "as described already , this decrease in amplitude is tightly coupled with the temperature compensation mechanism .",
    "it is also interesting to note that in many circadian clocks , the period does not depend on the temperature , although the amplitude decreases with temperature @xcite . if every elementary step of the circadian clock were temperature compensated at the single - molecule level , this temperature dependence of the amplitude would not be possible",
    "furthermore , the entrainment of the kaic oscillation to imposed temperature cycles , as observed in a recent experiment would also not be possible @xcite . in our study ,",
    "the compensation is based on the different temperature dependences of the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation processes ; the entrainment is a result of this difference .",
    "our mechanism for temperature compensation depends on paucity of kaia  increasing the kaia concentration leads to loss of the compensation .",

    "<S> circadian clocks ubiquitous in life forms ranging bacteria to multi - cellular organisms , often exhibit intrinsic temperature compensation ; the period of circadian oscillators is maintained constant over a range of physiological temperatures , despite the expected arrhenius form for the reaction coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> observations have shown that the amplitude of the oscillation depends on the temperature but the period does not  this suggests that although not every reaction step is temperature independent , the total system comprising several reactions still exhibits compensation . </S>",
    "<S> we present a general mechanism for such temperature compensation . </S>",
    "<S> consider a system with multiple activation energy barriers for reactions , with a common enzyme shared across several reaction steps with a higher activation energy . </S>",
    "<S> these reaction steps rate - limit the cycle if the temperature is not high . </S>",
    "<S> if the total abundance of the enzyme is limited , the amount of free enzyme available to catalyze a specific reaction decreases as more substrates bind to common enzyme . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this change in free enzyme abundance compensate for the arrhenius - type temperature dependence of the reaction coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> taking the example of circadian clocks with cyanobacterial proteins kaiabc consisting of several phosphorylation sites , we show that this temperature compensation mechanisms is indeed valid . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , if the activation energy for phosphorylation is larger than that for dephosphorylation , competition for kaia shared among the phosphorylation reactions leads to temperature compensation . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , taking a simpler model , we demonstrate the generality of the proposed compensation mechanism , suggesting relevance not only to circadian clocks but to other ( bio)chemical oscillators as well . </S>"
