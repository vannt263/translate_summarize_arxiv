    "the discovery of superconductivity in the non - centrosymmetric heavy fermion compound cept@xmath0si @xcite has attracted much attention .",
    "non - centrosymmetricity leads to antisymmetric spin - orbit coupling ( asoc ) which , for example , gives rise to mixed parity pairing , and the characteristic anisotropy of the spin susceptibility in the superconducting state [ 3 - 9 ] .",
    "recently , artificial superlattices involving the heavy fermion compound cein@xmath0 @xcite and cecoin@xmath1 @xcite have been fabricated , realizing two - dimensional multi - layer structures of heavy electron systems and ordinary metals .",
    "a particularly interesting case is the superlattice of cecoin@xmath1 and ybcoin@xmath1 which shows superconductivity , most likely induced by the cecoin@xmath1 layers .",
    "motivated by this system we setup a model of a superconductor with similar layered structure , including the fact that such structures show distinctive violation of inversion ( reflection ) symmetry , while the overall system has inversion centers .",
    "such local non - centrosymmetricity is expected to have a pronounced effect on the superconducting phase through local occurrence of asoc , in particular , for the spin susceptibility .",
    "we introduce here model hamiltonian for multi - layer systems including asoc , given by @xmath2+\\sum_{{\\bf k},{\\it s},\\langle { \\it m , m'}\\rangle}t_{\\perp}c^{\\dag}_{{\\bf k}{\\it sm}}c_{{\\bf k}{\\it sm'}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator for an electron with spin @xmath5 on the layer @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the pauli matrices .",
    "the @xmath8-axes correspond to the @xmath9-axes of the tetragonal crystal .",
    "the first two term describe the intra - layer dispersion and the asoc .",
    "we consider a square lattice with a tight - binding model , i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "we choose the unit of energy as @xmath11 and assume the chemical potential @xmath12 .",
    "the electron density per site is approximately 0.63 .",
    "the asoc term preserves time reversal symmetry through the condition @xmath13 and has rashba structure , which we assume a simple form @xmath14 .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath15 are layer dependent and have opposite sign for layers above and below a center layer .",
    "the third term introduces intra - layer cooper pairing via an off - diagonal mean field . here",
    "@xmath16 involves both the spin singlet and triplet components , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are scalar and vector order parameters for the spin - singlet and triplet pairing on layer @xmath6 , respectively . for simplicity",
    "we use an order parameter on phenomenological grounds without resorting to any microscopic model based on a pairing mechanism . to be concrete",
    "we use an s - wave order parameter for the singlet and a p - wave order parameter for the triplet pairing , where on symmetry grounds we request @xmath20 : @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we choose @xmath23 , @xmath24 , small enough to satisfy the condition @xmath25 .",
    "the dominant order parameter component keeps the same sign over all layers , while the other ( subdominant ) component adjusts the sign with the asoc ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the fourth term describes the inter - layer hopping of electrons between nearest - neighbor layers .",
    "we assume that the inter - layer hopping @xmath27 is smaller than the intra - layer hopping @xmath28 .",
    "we now calculate the spin susceptibility of the multi - layer superconductors with spatially inhomogeneous asoc , concentrating on the magnetic field direction along the _ c_-axis .",
    "the spin susceptibility @xmath29 is obtained numerically by calculating the magnetization @xmath30 for a small magnetic field @xmath31 .",
    "the necessary zeeman coupling term is given by , @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the bohr magneton .",
    "first , the hamiltonian is diagonalized in the presence of a field , introducing the unitary transformation @xmath35 in nambu - space of @xmath36 layers , where the quasiparticle operators form a @xmath37-dimensional vector @xmath38 and analogous for the bogoliubov quasiparticle operators @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian is @xmath40 where @xmath41 are the quasiparticle energies .",
    "the magnetization is obtained as , @xmath42_{ii}f(e_{i}({\\bf k})),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the fermi - dirac distribution function .",
    "the matrix representation of spin operator is defined in the @xmath44 basis as @xmath45 with @xmath46 the @xmath47-component of the spin operator in the @xmath37-dimensional space .    as concrete examples we discuss the spin susceptibility of bi - layer ( @xmath48 ) and tri - layer ( @xmath49 ) systems at @xmath50 .",
    "the corresponding coupling constants of asoc are described as @xmath51 for bi - layers and @xmath52 for tri - layers .",
    "we compare now the two cases : ( 1 ) the spin triplet channel is dominant @xmath53 and ( 2 ) the spin singlet channel is dominant @xmath54 . in case ( 1 ) the spin susceptibility remains unaffected by the superconducting state , @xmath55 , because the spin triplet component of the type @xmath56 is an equal - spin pairing state with cooper pair spins along the @xmath57-axis .",
    "thus , spin polarization in the superconducting phase is possible without pair breaking .",
    "this feature is essentially independent of asoc and inter - layer hopping as can be seen in fig.[m23 ] for both the bi- and tri - layer systems .",
    "spin susceptibility along _",
    "c_-axis for bi - layer system ( i ) and tri - layer system ( ii ) .",
    "we assume @xmath58 ( solid line ) and @xmath59 ( dashed line ) . ]",
    "spin susceptibility along _",
    "c_-axis for bi - layer system ( i ) and tri - layer system ( ii ) .",
    "we assume @xmath58 ( solid line ) and @xmath59 ( dashed line ) . ]",
    "spin susceptibility along _",
    "c_-axis for tri - layer system .",
    "the contribution from each layer is shown .",
    "we assume @xmath60 , and @xmath58 ( solid line ) and @xmath59 ( dashed line ) . ]",
    "more interesting is case ( 2 ) as spin singlet pairing leads to complete suppression of the spin susceptibility at @xmath50 in a conventional superconductor .",
    "indeed for vanishing asoc ( @xmath61 ) we find @xmath62 irrespective of @xmath63 .",
    "as soon as asoc is turned on , however , the spin susceptibility gradually recovers and approaches for large @xmath64 a constant value : @xmath65 for the bi - layer and @xmath66 for the tri - layer .",
    "the mechanism for this behavior lies in the spin - splitting of the electronic spectrum due to the rashba - type asoc .",
    "the spin polarization involves now an inter - band van - vleck - type contribution which is only weakly affected by the opening of quasiparticle gap in the superconducting phase .",
    "note that this inter - band contribution relies on the asoc for matrix elements with the zeeman coupling and is only available for the layers with non - vanishing @xmath64 .",
    "consequently , in the bi - layer system all layers are involved , giving rise to full recovery of @xmath67 for large @xmath64 ( analogous to the uniformly non - centrosymmetric superconductor @xcite ) , while in the tri - layer system only two of three layers can contribute yielding a correspondingly reduced limiting value for @xmath67 .",
    "figure  [ el ] corroborates this picture by considering the contributions of the different layers .",
    "indeed in the large @xmath68 regime the outer layers @xmath69 carrying asoc saturate at @xmath70 while the center layer @xmath71 completely suppresses .",
    "remarkably at small @xmath64 ( @xmath72 ) , @xmath73 behaves for all layers in the same way and leads for the center layer to a striking non - monotonic @xmath64-dependence .",
    "the numerical data in fig.[m23 ] show that the inter - layer hopping is in competition with asoc , such that a larger @xmath63 yields a higher effective @xmath74 for the crossover from the behavior of conventional superconductor to that of non - centrosymmetric superconductor .",
    "this crossover is best evident in the peak of @xmath67 around @xmath75 for the center layer ( fig.[el ] ) .",
    "thus , modifying @xmath63 , e.g. , by uniaxial stress along the _ c_-axis , can influence the magnetic response for _ c_-axis fields in case ( 2 ) .",
    "no such effect is expected for case ( 1 ) .    within our model",
    "we find that the spin susceptibility along the _",
    "ab_-axis is always the half of the value observed along _",
    "c_-axis , independent of the strength of @xmath64 and @xmath63 and the number of layers . furthermore , we find that the spin susceptibility for both field directions is affected by the phase difference of order parameter between layers , but independent of the ratio of spin singlet and triplet components .",
    "details will be explained elsewhere .",
    "in view of the fact that cecoin@xmath1 is known to realize spin singlet superconductivity , we believe that most likely case ( 2 ) of our discussion is relevant for the multi - layer systems .",
    "thus , the large observed upper critical fields in the superlattice of cecoin@xmath1 @xcite would then rely on the presence of the spatially modulated asoc .",
    "moreover we believe that the variability of the superlattices and also the possibility of local measurements of magnetic properties through nmr would give many intriguing insights into the aspect of asoc in these artificial systems .",
