    "in 2000 , virbhadra and ellis @xcite revived interest in the study of very strong gravitational lensing . because black holes are extremely compact , they are able to cause photons to loop around the black hole once or more times before they reach the observer .",

    "they calculated the location and magnitude of the outermost two relativistic images on both sides of the source for a variety of image positions .",
    "they showed that for all realistic image positions , relativistic images are extremely demagnified .",
    "in later work , @xcite showed that relativistic image properties near sgr a * will be different if the schwarzschild metric is substituted for a janis - newman - winicour metric associated with a static , spherically symmetric real scalar field and catalogued the dependency of relativistic image properties on scalar charge .",
    "this demonstrated the potential for extreme lensing to differentiate between different types of matter in the galactic center .",
    "the work done in these papers was done by numerically solving the virbhadra - ellis lens equation for the image position @xmath10 from the optic axis and for the image magnification .",

    "later studies showed the results of lensing of light around sgr a * if the mass at sgr a * was assumed to be a reissner - nordstrom black hole @xcite , a braneworld black hole @xcite , or other exotic spacetimes @xcite .",
    "work on braneworld black holes found that a negative value for @xmath9 in the trn metric creates a larger photon sphere , so relativistic images are further from the optic axis than in a schwarzschild spacetime .",

    "this reflects the scenario of light looping around the black hole before reaching the observer .",
    "we consider this the first relativistic image , and we examine its properties in the next section .",
    "relativistic images form very close to the angular position of the photon sphere .",
    "this is because light from a star would need to pass close enough to the photon sphere to generate a large enough deflection for it to loop around the black hole before reaching the observer .",
    "the greater the bending angle required to reach the observer , the closer light must approach to the black hole .",

    "[ fig : reltheta ] , we show the ratio of the image position to @xmath31 over time",
    ".    there are several interesting results in fig .",
    "[ fig : reltheta ] .",
    "first is that although the image position in the ern spacetime is smaller than the image position in the other two spacetimes , the image shifts considerably more relative to the photon sphere . in terms of the different spacetimes ,",
    "relativistic images appear closest to the photon sphere in the trn spacetime , a little more distant from the photon sphere in the schwarzschild spacetime , and the most shifted images appear in an ern spacetime .",
    "secondly , the shift relative to the photon sphere , for all spacetimes , in smallest for s2 , greater for s14 , and greatest for s6 ( the plots are not shown for s6 and s14 ) .",
    "understanding these effects can give us insight into the strong lensing that takes place near a black hole .",
    "the images appear close to the photon sphere for s2 ( when compared to s6 or s14 ) .",
    "this is due to the poor alignment of s2 with the optic axis even at its peak alignment ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "light must pass close to the photon sphere to generate the extra deflection required to make up for the large source angular position .",
    "we can explain the relationship between the spacetime and position of the relativistic image relative to the photon sphere by considering the plot of the bending angle in each spacetime . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bendingspacetime ] , we plot the bending angle of the three spacetimes as a function of closest approach .",
    "the bending angle function is steepest for the ern metric . as the point of closest approach approaches the photon sphere ,",
    "the bending angle in the ern spacetime is largest . the bending angle for the schwarzschild spacetime does not descend as quickly , and the descent is gentlest for the trn spacetime . for a given source , lens , and observer configuration , the bending angle is determined . by inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : bendingspacetime ] , the value of @xmath44 required to generate that bending angle is smallest for the trn spacetime and largest for the ern spacetime .",
    "hence , the image in the ern spacetime appears furthest from the photon sphere on a relative ( to the photon sphere ) basis .",
    "next , we used the formula for image magnification in eq .",
    "( [ eq : magsdl ] ) to calculate the apparent brightness of the first relativistic image of s2 over the course of its orbit around sgr a*. this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s2rel ] .    at peak brightness , and at all other times ,",
    "the brightest image is the one in the ern spacetime , which constrasts with the case of the secondary image , in which the trn spacetime is the brightest .",
    "even though image positions in the ern spacetime are smaller and , therefore , tangential magnification is smaller , the radial magnification is increased in the ern spacetime because of the shallower nature of @xmath45 in the ern spacetime . at peak ,",
    "the ern image is about 1.2 magnitudes brighter than the schwarzschild image and about 1.7 magnitudes brighter than the trn image .",
    "when the images are fainter , the differences are even greater , as many as 2.5 magnitudes can separate the ern image and the fainter trn image , and the ern image can be as many as 1.7 magnitudes brighter than the schwarzschild image .",
    "the peak brightness of all images , both secondary and relativistic , occurs during the period between periapse and maximum alignment about 13 days later .",
    "interestingly , the peak brightness of relativistic images occurs a bit earlier than the peak brightness of the secondary image .",
    "and even within relativistic images , peak brightness occurs at slightly different times for each metric . in terms of time after periapse , the ern image peaks about @xmath46 days after periapse , the schwarzschild image @xmath47 days , the trn image @xmath48 days , and the secondary image @xmath49 days . as s2 moves away from periapse",
    ", the @xmath50 term in the magnification contributes towards dimming the image .",
    "however , as @xmath21 continues to grow smaller as s2 approaches its maximum alignment , the term @xmath51 grows and contributes to brightening the image . for part of the period between periapse and maximum alignment ,",
    "the increase in @xmath51 offsets the decrease in @xmath50 and the image continues to brighten .",
    "however , as @xmath21 grows smaller , the photons do not go as deeply into potential well as they require a smaller bending angle .",
    "since the bending angle function in all spacetimes flattens as @xmath4 gets larger , @xmath51 grows at a smaller rate and eventually , the decreasing @xmath50 term dominates and the image starts to grow fainter .",
    "for an image in an ern spacetime @xmath44 is greater than it is for a trn or schwarzschild spacetime  for a given configuration and required value of @xmath52 , light in the trn requires a path that brings it closer to the photon sphere . in an ern spacetime",
    ", however , a larger value of @xmath44 generates the same bending angle .",
    "therefore , the image in the ern spacetime is in a flatter part of the bending angle function in fig .",
    "[ fig : bendingspacetime ] , and the bending angle does not decrease as quickly as @xmath21 decreases .",
    "hence , the radial magnification does not go up as quickly as @xmath21 approaches periapse , and the image reaches peak brightness quicker . since the image in the trn spacetime",
    "is stuck deeper in the black hole s potential , near the photon sphere , as @xmath21 decreases , the bending angle decreases quicker , leading to a greater increase in tangential magnification , and the image continues to grow brighter . a similar dynamic plays out for other stars we have analyzed , and the light curves for the first relativistic image of s6 and s14 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : s6rel ] .",
    "we have analyzed the difference between relativistic images in extremal reissner - nordstrom , tidal reissner - nordstrom , and schwarzschild spacetimes .",
    "although observational capabilities are nowhere close to being able to see these images , and the uncertainties in these stars orbital parameters are more than some of the effects discussed , the study of these details challenges and expands our understanding of the magnification mechanism , dynamics in the vicinity of a black hole , and the subtle effects that come into play for relativistic images .",
    "these lessons can be used for futher studies of images in the galactic center .",
    "the fact that the properties of images are sensitive to the choice of metric indicates that gravitational lensing in the galactic center may one day be an important probe of gr .",
