    "the possibilities offered by quantum mechanical systems for efficient information processing have stimulated in recent years the rise of an entirely new field of research @xcite .",
    "quantum protocols for secure communication over long distances have been devised and demonstrated .",
    "quantum algorithms for efficient solution of problems believed to be intractable on classical computers have been developed . however , while quantum communication is already approaching the stage of real - world applications , quantum computation remains still at a less advanced level , as far as physical implementation is concerned .",
    "different systems are being proposed as candidates for this purpose @xcite , but nobody can yet tell what will turn out to be a viable solution . indeed , in a few cases quantum computation building blocks ",
    "single- and two - qubit operations   have been already demonstrated experimentally . in principle , these ingredients are universal  they are sufficient to build an arbitrary unitary transformation over @xmath0 qubits ( i.e. , any quantum computation ) . but in order to perform useful computations in a real environment inducing decoherence , fault tolerance is also required .",
    "this implies e.g. nested redundant coding for real - time error correction @xcite , and requires an error probability for elementary operations below a certain threshold ( of the order of @xmath1 ) .",
    "hence the need for new proposals , allowing for handling a bigger number of qubits at a lower decoherence rate and with faster and more reliable gate operations  in a word , enabling scalability of the system .",
    "we propose to use quantum optical systems in periodic microscopic potentials .",
    "this is meant to combine the good isolation and precise control by laser fields , achievable in quantum optics , with the ability ",
    "usually associated with semiconductor technology   of manufacturing periodic structures to generate modulated fields on a microscopic scale .",
    "the general concept of our proposal is to encode the logical states of each qubit into two internal states of a particle ( neutral atom or ion ) .",
    "single - qubit operations are obtained as rabi rotations by applying resonant laser fields .",
    "two - qubit gates are performed by inducing a state - dependent interaction over a certain time , making the particles acquire a conditional phase shift depending on their logical states .",
    "these , however , in a real situation are coupled to other external degrees of freedom .",
    "this can lead to different kinds of imperfections . on one hand",
    ", the external state after gate operation may not be exactly the same as before .",
    "on the other hand , the conditional phase shift will also depend on the external state : if this is mixed , only an imprecise phase determination will be possible .",
    "these facts affect the gate fidelity , which is defined by comparing the desired effect of the gate with the actual evolution that can be obtained in the laboratory .",
    "we already proposed several schemes , based on different interactions ",
    "collisional interactions between neutral atoms in optical lattices @xcite and magnetic microtraps @xcite , or dipole - dipole interactions between rydberg - excited atoms @xcite . here",
    "we deal with electrostatic interaction between ions @xcite in arrays of microscopic traps @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we describe the conditional dynamics for two charged particles , trapped in separate harmonic wells , interacting via electrostatic repulsion and under the influence of an external state - dependent force , which can be generated e.g. by an off - resonant laser standing wave @xcite .",
    "the goal is to implement a phase gate between the two qubits ( sec .",
    "[ section : defgate ] ) , i.e. to transform their initial state by inducing a certain phase onto each of its components .",
    "the ideal transformed state so defined has to be compared to the one that can be obtained by means of a realistic hamiltonian , coupling the particles internal and external degrees of freedom ( sec .",
    "[ section : cond ] ) . to this aim , we consider first a one - dimensional classical model for the motion ( sec .",
    "[ section : class ] ) .",
    "we solve the equations of motion for each combination of logical states separately , and define in each case a two - particle phase as the integral over time of the interaction energy .",
    "these phases define the evolved internal state , to be eventually compared with the ideal state we aim to obtain .",
    "the fidelity of gate operation is evaluated , in this classical model , as the overlap between the real and the ideal state , averaged over different starting conditions according to a thermal probability distribution for the initial oscillation energies .",
    "the outcome is a series expansion for the temperature dependence of the fidelity , of which we give explicitly the first terms .",
    "the full three - dimensional quantum - mechanical calculation follows the same path ( sec .",
    "[ section : quantum ] ) , except for a couple of points .",
    "first , the two - particle phases are now given directly by the schrdinger equation and not defined ad hoc as before .",
    "second , the fidelity is evaluated by tracing out the external variables of a density matrix representing a mixed thermal quantum state .",
    "we calculate perturbative corrections arising from multipole terms in the coulomb potential , and show how to suppress lowest - order corrections to the fidelity by means of an intermediate @xmath2 rotation on the qubits , thus achieving an improvement by several orders of magnitude .",
    "we want to implement quantum logic between particles stored in an array of microscopic traps .",
    "the qubits logical states @xmath3 and @xmath4 are encoded into particles internal states .",
    "one basic building block towards multi - qubit entanglement operations is the phase gate between two qubits  a transformation which rotates by a certain phase just one component of logical states : @xmath5 when @xmath6 , this is equivalent   up to single qubit rotations   to a controlled - not gate .",
    "ideally , this would be accomplished by means of a state - dependent interaction of the form @xmath7 acting over a time @xmath8 such that @xmath9 however , it is not straightforward to realize in practice an interaction between two particles which couples only their internal states  other degrees of freedom , for instance the motional ones , are likely to be affected .",
    "therefore our goal is to approximate the ideal transformation eq .",
    "( [ defgate ] ) by means of a conditional dynamics for two particles , making them acquire the phase @xmath10 if and only if they are both in the internal state @xmath4 , and leaving eventually the external degrees of freedom practically unaffected .",
    "this is described a hamiltonian of the form @xmath11 denotes the external degrees of freedom of particle @xmath12 , and the explicit time dependence indicates that we can switch on and off a suitable interaction in order to obtain the desired effect . to evaluate the performance of our scheme",

    "the latter can be undone by means of single - qubit rotations ( see app .  [",

    "in other words , at nonzero temperatures there will be a finite probability that each particle starts in an excited motional state , leading in general to different phases , which can not be experimentally controlled and easily undone by single - qubit rotations .",
