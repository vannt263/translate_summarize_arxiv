    "major observational campaigns have searched for dark matter in the form of massive compact halo objects ( machos ) using microlensing events ( e.g. alcock et al 1997 ; afonso et al .",
    "2003 ; udalski et al .",
    "the detection of 1317 microlensing events toward the large magellanic cloud during 6 years by the macho collaboration implies that a significant fraction ( 20@xmath3 ) of the halo of the galaxy may be in the form of compact halo objects ( alcock et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the time scale of these lensing events eliminates the possibility of machos having substellar masses .",
    "the macho collaboration finds a most probable mass of 0.5 @xmath4 which supports the idea of a massive halo comprised of baryonic matter in the form of low luminosity white dwarfs ( kawaler 1996 ) .",
    "recent observations by the eros group provide further evidence that less than 25% of a standard dark matter halo can be composed of objects with a mass between 2 @xmath5 10@xmath6 @xmath4  and 1 @xmath4  ( afonso et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "halo white dwarf stars are expected to have large proper motions as a result of their high velocities relative to the sun .",
    "hst proper motion studies of the globular cluster ngc 6397 showed that most of the required dark matter in the solar vicinity can be accounted for by a population of old white dwarfs representing the thick disk and halo of the galaxy ( mendez 2002 ) .",
    "claims by oppenheimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and ibata et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that they had found a significant population of halo white dwarfs from kinematic surveys are tantalizing .",
    "their discoveries seemed to be consistent with earlier findings of an old population of white dwarfs in the hubble deep field ( mendez & minniti 2000 ) .",
    "however , further analysis by several groups showed that the sample of oppenheimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) could also be interpreted as the tail of a kinematically warmer white dwarf component , better explained by the thick disk population of the galaxy ( reid et al .",
    "2001 ; reyle et al .",
    "2001 ; mendez 2002 ; bergeron 2003 ) .",
    "the hubble deep - field ( hdf ) provides a unique window on the universe ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ; flynn et al .",
    "the extreme depth of the hdf provides an unprecedented advantage to find faint stellar objects as well as to study very distant galaxies .",
    "the advantage of going deep is that it allows us to search for faint stellar components of the galaxy in the regions of the color  magnitude diagram that are devoid of any contamination by standard galactic stars .",
    "the lack of ordinary disk stars is due to the finiteness of the galaxy ( flynn et al .",
    "mendez & minnitti ( 2000 ) claimed that the faint blue objects found in the hdf  north and hdf  south are galactic stars based on the observed number of blue sources and extragalactic sources in the two fields .",
    "independent proper motion measurements for five of these faint blue sources by ibata et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggested that they are cool halo white dwarfs which could account for the entire missing mass in the solar neighborhood .",
    "third epoch data on these five objects , however , did not show any significant proper motion ( r. ibata , private communication ; richer 2001 ) .",
    "we use the original hubble deep field ",
    "north data and images of the same field taken 7 years later for the great observatories origin deep survey ( goods ) to measure proper motions of the point sources analyzed by ibata et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and mendez & minniti ( 2000 ) .",
    "goods is a multi - wavelength , multi - facility deep survey designed to study galaxy formation and evolution over a large redshift range .",
    "it includes deep imaging with acs in the b , v , i , and z bands , and reaches down to ab @xmath7 28.1 , 28.4 , 27.7 , and 27.6 in the four bands , respectively ( 10 sigma , point source ) ( giavalisco et al 2003 ) . our second epoch data , acquired with hst and acs as part of the goods acs treasury program ,",
    "provide a baseline of 7 years .",
    "the goods team released version 1.0 of the reduced , calibrated , stacked , and mosaiced images of the hdf  north in 17 sections .",
    "section 32 ( total integrations of 34.9 ks in v and 36.9 ks in i ) and section 33 ( 48.9 ks in v and 51.9 ks in i ) overlap with the original hdf  north images .",
    "the source catalogs for the first epoch are produced by the space telescope science institute ( stsci ) from the combined and drizzled images .",
    "we note that the first epoch hdf ",
    "north catalogue is based on rereduced hdf ",
    "north images by casertano et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , providing a 10% increase in depth .",
    "we used the sextractor package ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) , version 2.3 , to build source catalogues from the second epoch data .",
    "the major motivation for using sextractor was its incorporation of weight maps in modulating the source detection thresholds .",
    "source detection was carried out on the inverse - variance - weighted sum of the v and i band drizzled images .",
    "the combined v + i image is deeper than any of the individual images ( casertano et al .",
    "only those objects matching the positions of the objects in the first epoch data with differences less than 0.2 arcsec are included in our final catalogue .",
    "furthermore , we visually inspected all of the sources used for our proper motion study to avoid any mismatches .",
    "although the goods team released version r1.0 of the acs multi - band source catalogs , their catalogs are based on z  band detection only ( giavalisco et al . 2004 ) .",
    "hence the released catalogs are not appropriate for the study of faint blue objects .",
    "the goods data are 0.5  0.8 mag shallower than the original hdf images , therefore we use the first epoch images for photometry . astrometric and photometric data for the point sources in the hdf  north are given in table 1 .",
    "we adopted the calibrated v and i photometry of mendez & minniti ( 2000 ) .    although the effective point spread function ( epsf ) fitting procedure ( anderson & king 2000 ) is the most precise astrometric technique for hst images , well - exposed star images are required to accurately sample the psf .",
    "there are not many stars in the hubble deep field , and the main source of error in our proper motion measurements is the positions of the reference compact objects ( galaxies ) .",
    "therefore the epsf method is not necessary and was not used for our analysis .",
    "the original hdf images were rereduced and corrected for distortion by casertano et al .",
    "the second epoch data were corrected for distortion by the goods team using the latest ( july 2003 ) coefficients released by the acs group at stsci . even with these distortion corrections , however , some distortion remains ( bedin et al .",
    "the effect of the remaining distortion is larger if a global coordinate transformation is used . instead of performing a global transformation ,",
    "we have used the iraf routine geomap to derive a quadratic local transformation for each star , using a surrounding net of several dozen compact objects ( isolated , low residuals , and not fuzzy ) . after mapping the distortions with the geomap package",
    ", object coordinates were transformed to the second epoch positions with the geoxytran routine .",
    "figure 1 shows the contour maps for the two bright stars hdf2272 and hdf3072 . the immediate field around each object is shown with dashed lines crossing at the first epoch position .",
    "the second epoch position is marked with an asterisk .",
    "this figure shows that sextractor works very well for bright compact objects and these two objects are apparently moving . for faint objects pixel maps",
    "are more informative than contour maps .",
    "pixel maps for two faint , possibly moving objects are shown in figure 2 .",
    "solid lines cross at the first epoch position , and the second epoch position is marked with a box .",
    "centroiding errors for faint stars are naturally worse , therefore proper motion errors are larger for the fainter stars .",
    "proper motion measurements are mainly affected by distortion mapping and selection of reference objects .",
    "the rms error of the transformations are larger than the positional errors of the objects . in order to check our distortion solution",
    "we have used the geomap package with different polynomial terms .",
    "we started with no distortion correction and deleted deviant points using a 3 @xmath8 rejection algorithm .",
    "rejection of very deviant points is required due to the fact that our reference objects are compact galaxies and centroiding errors are larger for galaxies .",
    "we used quadratic , quadratic with one cross ",
    "term , and quadratic with 4 cross ",
    "terms local transformations . for most of the objects ,",
    "the results from higher  order transformations were very similar to the results from the quadratic ( with no cross  term ) local transformation .",
    "this gave us confidence in the stability of our procedure . for two objects ,",
    "the use of the higher  order terms made the distortion solution unstable because of the relative positioning of the reference objects . to be conservative",
    ", we adopted the quadratic with no cross  term local transformation for distortion mapping for all of our objects .",
    "figure 3 shows the differences between second epoch coordinates and transformed first epoch coordinates for one of our stars , hdf1583 , and the surrounding 40 reference objects .",
    "a 3 @xmath8 rejection algorithm is later used to eliminate outliers from the sample .",
    "error bars include positional errors from the sextractor first and second epoch coordinates and the rms error of the transformation .",
    "it is clear from this figure that hdf1583 is statistically well separated from the reference objects , most or all of which are galaxies : it is moving with respect to this external reference frame .    in order to further test our transformations ,",
    "we have also used all compact objects with positional differences between the two epochs of less than 0.4 pixels to perform a global transformation .",
    "we found 377 compact galaxies matching our criteria , and fit a quadratic polynomial to map the distortions .",
    "as described above , we have measured proper motions in four to six different ways .",
    "our conservative estimate of the proper motions , their significance ( @xmath9 ) , and position angle are given in table 2 , along with the observed range of proper motions from different transformation versions .",
    "a comparison of the observed ranges and errors for the proper motion measurements show that the errors are consistent with the variations between fitting techniques .",
    "typical errors in our measurements are @xmath22.5 mas yr@xmath1 .",
    "hence , only those objects having proper motions larger than 5 mas yr@xmath1 have significance greater than two .",
    "the bright objects hdf2272 , hdf2234 , hdf101 , hdf1583 , hdf3072 , hdf2258 , and hdf1481 are definitely moving , and the faint objects hdf1816 and hdf774 might be moving .    star  galaxy confusion becomes worse at faint magnitudes .",
    "only objects 15@xmath8 above the sky level were analyzed by mendez & minniti ( 2000 ) .",
    "proper motions provide further star - galaxy separation since anything with a significant proper motion can not be very distant ( e.g. ibata et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we calculated photometric distances for all objects in our sample assuming that they are either main sequence stars , white dwarfs , or white dwarfs on the blue hook of the cooling sequence .",
    "for a given @xmath10 color , we estimate three absolute magnitudes for each object by linearly interpolating the @xmath10 and @xmath11 relation for main sequence stars ( table 15.7 of allen s astrophysical quantities , 2000 ) , white dwarfs , and cool white dwarfs ( hansen et al . 1999 ) .",
    "white dwarfs become redder as they cool until the effects of collision induced absorption due to molecular hydrogen becomes significant below @xmath25000 k. the @xmath10 colors for white dwarfs are expected to become bluer for @xmath12 ( hansen et al .",
    "1999 ; saumon & jacobson 1999 ) .",
    "cool white dwarf colors can be quite different in johnson / kron - cousins and the hst filters since h@xmath13 opacity produces sharp flux peaks in the white dwarf spectra .",
    "the observed colors of the white dwarfs depend on the transmission peaks of the filters .",
    "richer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) calculated the hst colors for white dwarfs using the holtzmann et al .",
    "( 1995 ) bandpasses and the transformations they use to express fluxes in v , r and i. hubble deep field photometry is calibrated using the holtzmann et al .",
    "( 1995 ) transformations ( mendez & minniti 2000 ) .",
    "therefore we used richer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) white dwarf cooling tracks instead of more recent chabrier et al .",
    "( 2000b ) models .",
    "we use the apparent magnitudes of the objects and the adopted absolute magnitudes to estimate photometric distances .",
    "proper motion measurements and derived distances can be used to calculate tangential velocities using the equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the proper motion in arcsec yr@xmath1 , @xmath16 is the distance in parsecs , and @xmath17 is the tangential velocity in km s@xmath1 . with the assumption that the objects are either main sequence stars , da white dwarfs , or cool white dwarfs , derived distances and tangential velocities are given in table 3 .",
    "the differences between chabrier et al .",
    "( 2000b ) and richer et al . (",
    "2000 ) white dwarf colors are equivalent to absolute magnitude differences of 0 to 0.5 mag .",
    "this corresponds to 025% difference in estimated distances and velocities with an average difference of about 10% .",

    "they are located at distances of @xmath2 500 pc and have tangential velocities @xmath230 km s@xmath1 .",
    "their kinematic properties are consistent with being thin disk or thick disk objects ( see table 3 and figure 7 ) .",
    "the expected number of thin disk + thick disk white dwarfs is found to be 0.14  0.35 .",
    "we have found 6 to 14 times more disk white dwarfs in the hdf ",
    "n than expected from the models .",
    "assuming poisson statistics , the probability of finding two white dwarfs is 1% if the expected number of white dwarfs is 0.14 and 4% if the expected number of white dwarfs is 0.35 . the number of disk + thick disk white dwarfs may be substantially underestimated . due to small number statistics , however , this statement is only a 23 @xmath8 result and it heavily depends on the fact that hdf2234 and hdf3072 are white dwarfs . follow  up spectroscopy of these two objects is needed to confirm this result .",
    "mendez & minniti ( 2000 ) have found 22 galactic stars and 10 faint blue objects in the hubble deep field  south . a natural test to check the space density of disk and halo white dwarfs would be to obtain second epoch observations of the hdf  south to find high proper motion objects . also , the hst / acs ultra ",
    "deep field observations of the chandra deep field ",
    "south will be useful to search for faint blue objects at fainter magnitudes and to improve the morphological classification of these objects at brighter magnitudes . the ultra ",
