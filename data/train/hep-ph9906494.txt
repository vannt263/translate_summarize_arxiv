    "it is almost twenty years to search the exotic hadrons such as the glueballs and hybrids .",
    "there are some special states which are regarded as the candidates of hybrids , especially the @xmath10 and @xmath11 have been studied widely , but no confirmation has been made so far .",
    "recently , these two special states arouse great interest again .",
    "the e852 collaboration at bnl@xcite has reported a @xmath12 isovector resonance @xmath13 in the reaction @xmath14 .",
    "they also reported the mass @xmath15 mev and width @xmath16 mev .",
    "the crystal barrel collaboration has also claimed to find an evidence in @xmath17 annihilation which may be resonance with a mass of @xmath18 mev and a width of @xmath19 mev@xcite .",
    "the confirmation of these states will provide some evidence for the existence of hybrids . at present , all the experiences specialize on the light quark hybrids for some reasons , but it s necessary to extend the energy region to hybrids including b or c quark , which is also possible in the b or @xmath20 factory .    theoretically , the spectrum and decay width of hybrids have been calculated widely with many methods such as bag model@xcite , flux - tube model@xcite , qcd sum rules@xcite , lattice @xcite and other models@xcite . however , there are few works about the spectrum and decay width of heavy - light hybrids@xcite .",
    "hqet has led to much progress in the theoretical understanding of the properties of hadrons@xcite , one may ask a question whether it is suitable in the heavy - light hybrids . for the heavy - light hybrids ,",
    "the sum rules calculation in full qcd theory in ref.@xcite shows that the component of gluon gives a contribution more than @xmath21 to the mass , so the `` light freedom '' seems too heavy to keep the @xmath9 expansion available .",
    "the calculation of the spectrum of hybrids in hqet will give an answer to the question .",
    "our results show that the spectrum of heavy - light hybrids including @xmath22 or @xmath23 quark are close to those in full qcd theory , it is suitable to deal with these hybrids within hqet . besides , compared with @xmath24 and @xmath25 hybrid , the spectrum and decay width of the heavy - light hybrid is easier to be calculated in hqet .",
    "it is interesting for the experimentalists to search the exotic @xmath2 heavy - light hybrids , so theoretical determination of the property of these states is necessary and urgent . in full qcd theory",
    ", the estimation in ref.@xcite showed that the sum rule for the mass of @xmath2 heavy - light hybrids had no platform at all .",
    "the masses of @xmath2 hybrids were given under the main assumption that the contribution of gluon condensate is less than @xmath26 of the bare loop .",
    "in hqet , the ambiguous situation has been improved greatly .",
    "the surface of the @xmath27 versus borel variable @xmath28 varies little in a large region , which gives a good platform and determines the masses of the hybrids .    according to the mit bag model@xcite",
    ", the hybrids with the same @xmath29 have different internal interactions between the patrons which indicate that they are different states , that is to say , the gluon in hybrid can be in different tm(@xmath8 ) or te(@xmath3 ) mode . in order to predict the properties of them , we should choose suitable generating currents corresponding to these states for the calculation . in the case of light quark hybrids@xcite , these different @xmath0 states were found to have different masses . in heavy - light hybrids case",
    ", the calculation shows that the mass split of the @xmath0 heavy - light hybrids with gluon in different mode is not large in the @xmath30 limit .",
    "the mass of @xmath0 hybrids from two different currents , @xmath4 with gluon in tm(@xmath8 ) mode and @xmath6 with gluon in te(@xmath3 ) mode , is found similar .",
    "though the mass of these two different @xmath0 hybrids is similar , their decay widths to @xmath7 final states are found different : the decay widths from current @xmath4 are about 86 mev or 16 mev corresponding to @xmath31 or @xmath32 final states , respectively , while the ones from current @xmath6 are 11 mev or 2.6 mev .",
    "the decay widths of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 hybrids to @xmath7 have been calculated in ref.@xcite , where the decay constants of the hybrids were obtained from the formulae in full theory@xcite .",
    "both the strong couplings and the decay constants are calculated in hqet in this paper , and the strong coupling of the @xmath0 hybrid obtained here is much larger than that in ref.@xcite .",
    "the large difference is from the values of the decay constant calculated in two ways .    in the calculation of the strong couplings ,",
    "two - point function between the pion and vacuum is taken use of insteadly to avoid the ambiguity resulting from the double borel transformation for the three - point correlation function and the infrared problem in soft pion limit . for convenience ,",
    "the calculation is kept in the leading order of @xmath9 expansion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the analytic formalism of hqet sum rules for the spectrum of hybrid is given in sec .",
    "2 . in sec . 3",
    ", we give the numerical results of the spectrum and decay constants of hybrid , the comparison of the spectrum with that in full qcd theory is given too . in sec .",
    "4 , with the help of two - point correlation function between the pion and vacuum , the analytic formalism of hqet sum rules for the strong couplings of hybrids is derived and the numerical results of some decay widths were obtained . in the last section , we give the conclusion and discussion .",
    "as we know in ref.@xcite , the gluon in hybrid can be in different mode , tm(@xmath8 ) or te(@xmath3 ) mode . to analyze these different hybrids ,",
    "we must choose suitable generating current . for the spectrum of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 heavy - light hybrids with the gluon in tm(@xmath8 ) and te(@xmath3 ) mode ,",
    "respectively , the interpolated current in hqet is chosen as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the light quark field and @xmath35 is the heavy quark effective field , @xmath36 is the velocity of the heavy quark .",
    "then , we construct the correlation function as @xmath37 where @xmath38    since the free heavy quark propagator in hqet is @xmath39 and the interaction of the heavy quark with the gluon field @xmath40 in the leading order of @xmath9 expansion is @xmath41 . then under the fixed - point gauge",
    "@xmath42(which will be used throughout this paper ) , the full propagator of the heavy quark @xmath43 in the leading order of @xmath9 expansion is the same as the free one .",
    "the freedom of heavy quark can be extracted out of the matrix element as a delta function , which facilitates the calculation .    in the operator product expansion , we keep the perturbative term , two gluon condensate , three gluon condensate and two quark condensate .",
    "the contribution of mixing condensate and higher dimension operators are negligible since their smallness.the feynman diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "1 , where the double line represents the propagator of the heavy quark . after twice suitable borel transformation",
    ", we obtain the @xmath44 and @xmath45 corresponding to the scalar and vector contribution , respectively @xmath46 where the light quark mass corrections are considered also in these formulae .    as for the @xmath1 and @xmath3 hybrids ,",
    "the current was chosen as @xmath47 the correlation function expanded is similar to the vector current case except for the opposite sign for the contribution of the quark condensates and their spectrum will be determined in a similar way .    for the @xmath0 hybrid with the gluon in te(@xmath3 ) mode , the following current should be used to predict the mass @xmath48    the ope of the @xmath49 for this current has been carried out as @xmath50 in the chiral limit , the two gluon and two quark condensates vanish .",
    "on the phenomenal side , the decay constants of hybrids , @xmath51 , are defined as @xmath52 where @xmath53 represent the masses of hybrids , @xmath54 is the polarization vector and the two different @xmath0 hybrids with gluon in tm(@xmath8 ) or te(@xmath3 ) mode is represented as @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively . so the correlation function read @xmath57 where the first term of the right side is the pole term resulting from lowest lying resonance contribution and the second term represents the contribution of the continuum state and higher resonances , @xmath58 is the continuum threshold .    taking use of the dispersion relations for the correlation function to equate the both sides , we obtain @xmath59    after the borel transformation@xcite",
    ", they are turned into @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the borel transformation variable .",
    "so the @xmath27 can be determined as @xmath62    after the @xmath27 has been calculated , the decay constant can be carried out according to ( [ spect ] ) .",
    "in this content , we will give the numerical results of the spectrum and decay constants of the hybrids . to proceed the process ,",
    "the mass of the b and c quark are chosen as 4.7 gev and 1.3 gev , respectively , the condensates are chosen as @xmath63 and the scale of running coupling is set at the borel parameter @xmath61 .    the continuum threshold is chosen as below in the calculation : @xmath64 gev for the @xmath1 and two @xmath0 hybrids from current @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and @xmath67 gev for the @xmath3 and @xmath2 hybrids .",
    "we display our results in hqet and those in full qcd theory in table .",
    "1 . in this table ,",
    "the right two columns represent the mass of heavy - light hybrids calculated in full theory , the left represent the estimation in hqet and the bottom of this table represents the @xmath0 hybrids with the gluon in te(@xmath3 ) mode .",
    ".[tab1 ] _ masses of heavy - light hybrids with different @xmath29 _ ( gev ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +    to the processes ( [ processa ] ) and ( [ processb ] ) , the decay widths are given by the following formulae @xmath68    then in the @xmath69 , the numerical results of the decay widths read @xmath70    though the decay of hybrids appears to follow the @xmath71 selection rule , which means that the decay of hybrids to two s - wave mesons are suppressed @xcite , the selection rule is not absolute . in the flux tube and constituent glue models , it can be broken by wave function and relativistic effects , and the bag model predict that it is also possible that the excited quark loses its angular momentum to orbital angular momentum @xcite , the results obtained here support this idea .",
    "the decay widths of the processes to @xmath7 final states for @xmath55 with gluon in tm(@xmath8 ) mode is much larger than those for @xmath72 with gluon in te(@xmath3 ) mode , the reason is that the final states in the later channels are in the p wave .",
    "besides , the decay width of the @xmath73 obtained here is much larger than that we got in ref.@xcite , the difference is from the decay constant .",
    "the decay constant of the @xmath0 hybrid we got there in full theory is much smaller than the one calculated above in hqet .",
    "though the mass of these two @xmath0 hybrids is almost the same , the strong couplings to pion of them are different , so the decay widths of these two different @xmath0 hybrids are different .",
    "the decay width of the @xmath74 are smaller than those corresponding to @xmath75 .",
    "the physical reason about the difference of decay width of these two different @xmath0 hybrids is unknown to us yet , but the difference between these states provides a nice evidence that the decay property of these two @xmath0 hybrids with the gluon in different mode is different .",
    "we calculate the spectrum of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 heavy - light hybrids with different currents in hqet , the results from current @xmath4 and @xmath5 are compatible to those in full qcd theory .",
    "the calculation shows that the light freedom in heavy - light hybrids is not heavy enough to break down the @xmath9 expansion and it is suitable to apply hqet to heavy - light hybrid systems .",
    "the sum rules for the masses of @xmath2 heavy - light hybrids have no platform at all in full theory , so the masses of them were given under some assumptions .",
    "the ambiguity of these sum rules have been improved in hqet , which suggests the reasonableness of the assumptions in ref.@xcite in another way . in the calculation ,",
    "the leading order @xmath9 expansion approximation is used and only the first two terms in ope are kept in our estimate , which will bring some errors .",
    "besides , the decay constants will bring in large deviation too , it is necessary to determine them more precisely .",
    "since the gluon in hybrids can be in different mode , the hybrids with the same @xmath29 but different gluon mode are in fact different states . in the case of light quark hybrids ,",
    "the two different @xmath0 states have different masses definitely . in the heavy - light hybrids case ,",
    "the masses of these two different states are found similar in the @xmath69 limit , however , the calculation shows that the decay widths in the processes of these two hybrids to @xmath7 final states are different .",
    "the decay width of @xmath75 is found about 86(16 ) mev , while the decay width of @xmath74 is only 11(2.6 ) mev .",
    "the strong couplings and decay widths of the heavy - light hybrids in the processes of @xmath76 are calculated too .",
    "the large difference of the decay widths calculated here from those calculated in ref.@xcite lies on the large difference between the decay constants calculated in two different ways .",
