    "the electric curtain ( ec ) is a device consisting of a series of parallel electrodes embedded in a dielectric surface .",
    "alternating electric potentials are applied to these electrodes such that neighboring electrodes have a prescribed phase difference .",
    "an illustration of a two - phase ec is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : ecdraw ] . different ec geometry and control parameters , which will be defined later ,",
    "make it possible to create a variety of electric fields , which can generate a wealth of physical phenomena for charged particles .",
    "for this reason , the electric curtain has been proposed for manipulation and control of particles in many different applications . patented in 1974 by senichi masuda ,",
    "the ec was originally invented for particle control in an electrostatic powder - painting booth @xcite .",
    "other proposed applications include separation of cells in the aqueous solution @xcite and separation of by - products from agricultural processes @xcite , transport of toner particles in photocopying machines @xcite , mitigation of charged dust build - up for extra - terrestrial exploration of dusty planets and moons @xcite , and separation of charged particles with different charge - to - mass ratios @xcite .    despite those proposed applications of ecs , few commercial applications are reported .",
    "this may be in part due to the fact that particle dynamics induced by an ec are complex and still not well understood .",
    "the motion of particles in ec fields has been studied both experimentally and computationally by a number of investigators @xcite .",
    "these investigations have shown a variety of different propagating and stationary modes , including the recent report of intermittent changes of many - body particle motion discovered by chesnutt and marshall @xcite in a discrete - element simulation of transport on inclined ecs .    an ec configuration whose",
    "adjacent electrodes are excited by electric potentials with less than 180 degrees of phase difference will produce a traveling - wave electric field above the surface .",
    "particle motions in these types of fields have been found to have multifarious modes of transport , which are commonly characterized into three categories ; surfing mode , hopping mode , and curtain mode @xcite . in the surfing mode",
    ", particles travel synchronously with the wave front , whereas in the hopping mode particles will stick to the surface and hop stochastically when freed by a sufficiently strong electrostatic force or collision with another particle . in the curtain mode",
    ", high frequency electric field oscillations force particles to be levitated above the electrode surface and travel in a spiraling trajectory with considerably slower average forward progression speed than the propagation velocity of the traveling wave .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the particle nonlinear motion in an electric field generated by a two - phase ec , which has been called a `` standing wave '' @xcite ec . for some time",
    "it was believed that this type of ec would have poor transport properties @xcite .",
    "however , recently both experiments @xcite and numerical computations @xcite have demonstrated that 2-phase ecs can be very effective at transporting particles , and in fact particles will exhibit two very distinct modes of transport under different conditions .",
    "the relative simplicity of the 2-phase ec makes it an attractive candidate for many of the proposed applications .",
    "a significant amount of work has been reported on ecs , but the nonlinear dynamics of the particles within an ec field have not been studied in detail from a dynamical systems point of view . using simple mathematical models we have discovered very prolific behaviors of charged particles in a two - phase oscillating ec electric field",
    ". a detailed understanding of the rudimentary particle motions might help us better interpret the complex phenomenon often observed in real ec experiments .    to simplify the mathematical presentation , we have only considered @xmath2 and @xmath3 motion of a single charged particle .",
    "while this is a very simple system , it is nevertheless sufficient to exhibit a rich variety of dynamical behavior . using a similar method to that outlined by masuda and kamimura @xcite for 3-phase ecs , an approximate analytical equation has been derived for the motion of a charged particle in the 2-phase ec electric field .",
    "in general , motion of a single charged particle in the field of the 2-phase ec is two - dimensional , provided that no initial motion in the direction along the electrodes is introduced .",
    "however , a special case of one - dimensional particle motion , in which the electric field magnitude is insufficient to lift a particle initially located on the dielectric surface of the ec , is found to generate highly interesting particle behavior .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that the equations of motion contain a time - dependent potential , similar to the parametrically driven pendulum with a vertically oscillating suspension point , which is known to have interesting dynamical properties @xcite .",
    "our derived equations of motion are solved numerically and the behaviors of the particle motions induced by the oscillating electric field are examined .",
    "we obtain limit cycles which are fixed points in the appropriate poincar sections of the phase space , and bifurcations of these fixed points that lead to chaotic motions for a range of `` interaction amplitude '' values ( a dimensionless parameter containing the amplitude of electrode linear charge density and the charge carried by a particle ) .",
    "linear stability for very small interaction amplitude can be analyzed using a special case of the mathieu equation @xcite .",
    "as we increase the interaction amplitude , we show a variety of interesting trajectory types in the @xmath2 limit and several predominant trajectories for the @xmath3 cases .",
    "our model uses the so - called centerline charge approximation , in which a set of parallel electrodes in the @xmath4 plane of the cartesian coordinates are considered to be line filaments of infinite length oriented along the @xmath5-direction @xcite.the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane is chosen to be orthogonal to the electrode axes ( @xmath5-axis ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ecdraw ] , where the @xmath6 and @xmath7-axes are parallel and perpendicular to the dielectric surface , respectively . to find the electric potential and electric field above the plane of the electrodes produced by the set of equally spaced 2-phase electrodes , we adopt the conformal transformation used by masuda and kamimura @xcite :    @xmath8    this transformation maps the @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) half - plane containing infinite numbers of periodic electrodes into a unit circle in the @xmath11 complex plane containing just two electrodes .",
    "therefore , the electric potential can be easily computed in the @xmath11 plane .",
    "the inverse conformal transform is then performed to map the expression back to @xmath12 coordinates .",
    "the detailed derivation is given in appendix a. based on the derivation , the electric potential can be simply expressed as :    @xmath13 .",
    "using @xmath14 the electric field in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 directions is found to be    @xmath15    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the linear charge density amplitude of an electrode , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the mass and electric charge carried by a particle , respectively , @xmath20 is the wave number , and @xmath21 is the angular driving frequency of the driving electric fields . it is noted that we use the primed variables here to save unprimed variables for their dimensionless counterparts , which are defined below . for the centerline charge approximation to be valid it is required that the dielectric surface be located a minimal distance above the electrodes @xcite .",
    "however , if the surface is far from the electrodes , the cosh - term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ex ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ey ] ) diminishes as @xmath22 and consequently the electric field magnitude rapidly approaches zero .",
    "the dimensionless time , horizontal and vertical positions are defined by @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "a dimensionless interaction amplitude ( @xmath0 ) , gravitational acceleration ( @xmath26 ) and damping coefficient ( @xmath1 ) are , respectively , defined by @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the damping coefficient , and @xmath31 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "the dimensionless form of the differential equations governing the particle motion are :    @xmath32    @xmath33    letting the dimensionless spacing of the distance between neighboring electrodes be @xmath34 , the system is periodic over a distance @xmath35 in @xmath6 .",
    "we choose the dielectric surface to be at @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37 , for which the centerline charge approximation holds .",
    "two distinct regimes are considered : ( 1 ) a one - dimensional regime where the particle is constrained to roll or slide back and forth on the dielectric surface ; ( 2 ) a two - dimensional regime where the particle moves in the x - y plane , either being levitated above the surface or bouncing off of it .",
    "dissipative forces are included in the model for both regimes . for the @xmath2 regime",
    ", dissipative forces may arise both from rolling resistance between the particle and the surface and from the viscous fluid force ( stokes drag ) between the particle and the surrounding air .",
    "both of these dissipative forces are proportional to the particle velocity @xcite . in the @xmath3 case ,",
    "the particle is assumed to have elastic collisions with the dielectric surface , so the only dissipation is from fluid drag force .",
    "the transition from motion on the surface ( @xmath2 ) to the @xmath3 regime occurs when the maximum vertical force imposed on a particle immediately above an electrode exceeds the gravitational force on the particle . for a charged particle attached to the dielectric surface , the electric field",
    "is evaluated at a value of @xmath38 equal to the particle centroid position . letting the gravitational force balance the maximum electrostatic force ,",
    "the maximum value of the interaction amplitude @xmath0 for which the particle remains on the surface can be obtained by setting the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : dimlessy ] ) to zero , giving    @xmath39    with the location of the surface at @xmath36 , the critical value of this ratio for which the @xmath2 approximation applies is obtained as @xmath40 . in order to further simplify this system ,",
    "we neglect the adhesive van der waals force .",
    "this simple system is used to examine the nonlinear dynamics for small variations over a range of @xmath0 with constant values of @xmath1 .",
    "we classify different trajectories by the periodicity of their limit cycles in the full phase space . the interaction amplitude , damping , and initial conditions determine the periodicity of the particle trajectory .",
    "we compare the temporal length of a limit cycle to the inverse of the driving frequency of the electric field by using time maps .",
    "time maps are used to represent the advancement of an orbit in phase space by some amount of time . in general , a particle s position and velocity determine its position in phase space , which can be represented as a vector function @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the initial position in the phase space .",
    "we choose the time maps to be represented in the form @xmath43 .",
    "the time mapping gives a stroboscopic view of the parametric function @xmath44 when @xmath45 is a positive integer ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "for @xmath47 the time mapping highlights the relationship between the period of a trajectory and the driving frequency .",
    "we define an operator @xmath48 that maps the system forward in time by @xmath49 , so that the function @xmath43 may be written as @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath3 ec has five degrees of freedom @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "the periodicity of the system in @xmath6 and @xmath53 implores the use of a toroidal phase space .",
    "we use this notion of a toroidal phase space to fashion our poincar sections .",
    "we defer to the @xmath2 ec in order to visualize the toroidal phase space ( fig .",
    "[ fig : toroidspace ] ) . for the @xmath3 ec",
    "we can not graphically depict the full phase space but we use the same periodic geometries to fashion poincar sections .",
    "a poincar section includes any point where a continuous trajectory or flow transversely intersects a subspace of the space the trajectory occupies@xcite .",
    "strobing a periodically driven system will produce poincar sections of @xmath54 dimension , where @xmath55 is the dimension of the full phase space .",
    "this is equivalent to observing time maps @xmath56 acting on a point in phase space .",
    "it becomes apparent that this method of strobing or time mapping produces poincar sections when we look at a particle s trajectory as a function of time @xmath53 passing through a @xmath57 phase plane at a particular time @xmath53 .",
    "the particles path is always transverse to the @xmath57 plane and therefore a point of intersection of the trajectory with this plane is a convenient sub space that satisfies the criterion necessary to be a poincar section .",
    "it is also true that time maps generate poincar sections for the @xmath3 ec , but in this case the mappings represent intersections of a trajectory with a non - planar subspace .",
    "this is still a poincar section because the flow through the subspace is guarantied to be transverse to it due to the positive rate of change of time .",
    "-direction , and the periodic fluctuations of the electric field with time , it is useful to use toroidal geometry to describe the @xmath2 ec phase space .",
    "we define the @xmath53-axis as the line at the major radius when the minor radius is zero .",
    "the position and velocity at a given time may then be represented as a point in the plane orthogonal to the time axis described by an angle ( @xmath6 ) and radius ( @xmath51 ) .",

    "[ fig : toroidspace],width=8 ]    by filling a plane in phase space with an array of initial conditions , a large number of possible trajectories can be obtained for given values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",

    "is represented by a @xmath60 dimensional matrix @xmath61 , where the first index ( 2 ) is the dimensionality of the block and the second index ( @xmath62 ) is the number of different initial conditions in the block .",

    "we have shown that there exists two dominate regimes of particle behavior in the @xmath3 ec ; one of which is stable oscillations , the other is chaotic .",
    "therefore for ec mitigation applications it is necessary to understand the role of the surface as it is the primary instigator of non - stable particle trajectories .",
    "mitigation efficiencies could be improved by an ec design in which most of the particles fall into chaotic motion",
    ". this can be done by tuning the ec parameters so that charge - to - mass - ratios of interest will exist in an area of the parameter space for which no stable motion is possible . for many real applications , we certainly would face a system of multiple particles .",
