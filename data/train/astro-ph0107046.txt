    "in recent years , study of standing and oscillating shocks in accretion flows has become very important since it is recognized that the spectral states of black holes as well as quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) observed in light curves of black hole candidates are directly related to the radiative transfer properties of a compact comptonizing region close to a black hole ( e.g. , chakrabarti and titarchuk 1995 , ct95 ; ling et al .",
    "1997 ; chakrabarti & manickam , 2000 , cm00 ; muno et al . ,",
    "2000 ; feroci et al .",
    "2000 ; homan et al . ,",
    "these shocks have been studied most extensively in the literature ( chakrabarti 1989 , c89 ; chakrabarti 1990 , c90 ) and their properties have been verified by several independent groups @xcite of workers .",
    "if for a given set of initial parameters the standing shocks exists analytically , numerical simulations also would find them @xcite otherwise , the shock would be oscillating @xcite causing qpos in the x - rays emitted from the post - shock region .",
    "furthermore , it has been observed that at least in some of the black hole candidates , such as grs1915 + 105 , outflows are produced from the region which also emits the comptonized photons @xcite i.e. , the post - shock region or the centrifugal barrier dominated region according to our present understanding of the flow solutions .",
    "it is therefore pertinent to ask if the properties of the shocks , such as location , strength , compression ratio etc .",
    "could be understood solely analytically .",
    "the solutions obtained so far by chakrabarti and his collaborators and other groups always resort to numerical means .",
    "roughly , the method was the following : for a given set of parameters ( such as the specific energy and specific angular momentum ) , it is first determined if the flow allows more than one x - type sonic points ( c89 ) .",
    "this is because , at the horizon , matter must have velocity same as that of the velocity of light and for causality arguments , the flow must be supersonic .",
    "thus , once the flow becomes supersonic through the outermost sonic point , and forms a shock ( i.e. , jumps to a subsonic branch ) it must pass through the inner sonic point to become supersonic at the horizon .",
    "next question is whether the specific entropy at the inner sonic point is higher compared to that at the outer sonic point .",
    "this is because , at the shock , entropy must be generated and post - shock flow which passes through the inner sonic must have higher entropy .",
    "the final and the most important question is whether all the rankine - hugoniot conditions ( also known as the shock conditions ) are satisfied somewhere between the two x - type sonic points .",
    "the three rankine - hugoniot conditions could be combined to obtain a combination of mach numbers ( shock invariant ) .",
    "c89 obtained this expression which is continuous across the shock and used this to obtain the shock location by iterative technique .    in the present paper , we follow the same philosophy , but obtain the shock locations analytically . there were two motivations to do this .",
    "first , from the theoretical point of view , it is challenging to find solutions of a large number of non - linear equations which must satisfy a number of conditions mentioned above .",
    "second , from the observers point of view , any observation which could require standing shock waves , could be explained using more fundamental parameters , such as specific energy and angular momentum or even better , using accretion rates of keplerian and sub - keplerian flows as in a two - component flow solution of ct95 .",
    "analytical work also gives insight into why the shocks form in the first place .",
    "the boundary of the parameter space for shock formation is also obtained by analytical means .",
    "these findings are important as they would tell us when qpos may or may not be seen .",
    "these details would be discussed in future .    in the next section ,",
    "we present the model equations and shock conditions . in  3 , we present the sonic point analysis and write down the expression for shock invariant ( c89 ) for the shake of completeness . in  4 , we present the analytical expressions of the sonic points and discuss how the parameter space is divided into regions of one or three sonic points . in  5 , we present expression of shock locations and again divide the parameter space into regions which may or may not have shocks .",
    "we compare our solutions with numerical work . in  6 , we discuss some of the astrophysical implications of our solutions and finally , in  7 , we make concluding remarks .",
    "we start with a thin , axisymmetric , inviscid , steady flow which is in equilibrium in a direction transverse to the flow .",
    "the model equations which govern the motion of matter accreting into black hole are given as follows ( c89 ) :    _ a. radial momentum equation : _",

    "@xmath11 is the adiabatic index of the flow and @xmath12 is assumed to the equation of state .",

    "@xmath16 is the mass accretion rate apart from a geometric constant . if we assume that the flow is in hydrostatic equilibrium in the transverse direction , the vertical component of gravitational force balances the pressure gradient force .",
    "hence the expression for the half thickness of the disc is given by ( c89 ) , h(x)= a_ex^1/2(x-1 ) .",
    "we write the mass flux conservation equation in terms of @xmath4 and the sound speed on the equatorial plane @xmath17 in the following way , @xmath18 where , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the shock conditions which we employ here are the following ( c89 ) : + ( a ) the energy flux is continuous across the shock  e_+ = e_- ,    \\(b ) the mass flux is continuous across the shock  _ + = _ -    and finally , ( c ) the momentum balance condition  w_++_+ ^2_e_+ = w_-+_- ^2_e_- where subscripts `` @xmath21 '' and `` @xmath22 '' refer , respectively , to quantities before and after the shock .",
    "a shock satisfying these conditions is termed as a rankine - hugoniot shock @xcite . here ,",

    "in order to have a shock , the flow must be supersonic i.e. , the stationary flow must pass through the sub - sonic flow to a supersonic flow .",
    "discussions in this section are based on early works [ see , @xcite ] .      from the radial momentum equation and the continuity equation ( eqs . 1 and 3 ) we derive the sonic point condition ( or critical point condition ) in the usual way ( c89 ) .",
    "the first derivative of the radial velocity w.r.t radial distance is given by , = . here",
    ", @xmath28 is the effective potential .",
    "since the denominator must vanish at the sonic points , if the flow is assumed to be smooth everywhere , the numerator must also vanish simultaneously .",
    "the vanishing of the denominator gives , ^2_c(x_c)=a^2_c(x_c ) .",
    "the factor ( which is unity only in isothermal flows ) in front of @xmath29 arises because the flow is assumed to be in vertical equilibrium .",

    "it is to be noted that since the left hand side is always positive , angular momentum at the sonic point must be sub - keplerian , i.e. , @xmath32 ( e.g. , c90 and references therein ) .      from the equations given in",
    " 2 , we now seek an invariant relation which must be satisfied at the shock ( c89 ) .",
    "we rewrite the condition of energy flux continuity ( eq .",
    "6 ) , and the pressure balance condition ( eq . 8) in terms of the mach number @xmath33 of the flow , m^2_+a^2_++= m^2_-a^2_-+ , = m_+a^^_+f(x_s ) , = m_-a^^_-f(x_s ) , where @xmath34 , and = , where , @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the location of the shock . from eqs .",
    "( 14 - 17 ) one obtains the following equation relating the pre- and post - shock mach numbers of the flow at the shock ( c89 ) , c== .",
    "the constant @xmath37 is invariant across the shock . the mach number of the flow just before and after the shock can be written down in terms of @xmath37 as , m^2_= .",
    "the product of the mach number is given by , m_+m_-=- .",
    "to obtain shock locations , we need to first obtain the locations of the sonic points , and ensure that at least two of them are x - type ( c90 ) . in  3.1 , we presented the sonic point conditions . using the definition @xmath33 of the mach number , and substituting @xmath38 from eq .",
    "( 13 ) into eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we obtain following algebraic equation for @xmath39 given by , x^4_c - ox^3_c+px^2_c + -qx_c+r=0 .",
    "where , @xmath40 ; @xmath41 ; @xmath42 ; @xmath43 ; @xmath44 and @xmath27 @xmath45 is the polytropic index .",
    "we solve this equation analytically @xcite and get the location of the sonic points .",
    "details are given in appendix a. for the purpose of critical or sonic points , @xmath46 of the appendix would be denoted as @xmath47 .",
    "the equation has four roots and eq .",
    "a.8 can be used to check whether all of them are complex ( pair of complex conjugates ) or at least two are real and two are complex or all four are real . _ a necessary condition to form a shock wave is to have all four real roots .",
    "_ of course , only one would be inside the black hole , and the other three would be outside , and out of these , due to topological reasons , only two would be x - type or saddle type and the one in between must be ` o'-type or center type .",
    "these are determined by computing derivative @xmath48 at the sonic point by using lhospital s rule and checking if they are real . for our purpose , two derivatives at each sonic point",
    "must be real and of opposite signs in order that the sonic point be of x - type or saddle type .",
    "figure 1 shows the division of the parameter space . denoting the discriminant @xmath46 ( of appendix",
    "a ) by @xmath47 we find that the condition @xmath49 is the necessary condition to have three sonic points .",
    "the boundary @xmath50 separates this region on which two sonic points merge and the third one remains separate . outside of this region @xmath51 , and only one sonic point is possible and the other two roots are complex conjugate of each other .",
    "the dotted curve in the middle represents the condition : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the entropy accretion rates at the inner and outer sonic points respectively .",
    "the region above it contains parameters with @xmath55 and the region below it contains parameters with @xmath56 .",
    "this latter region is suitable for shock formation in accretion flows .    in passing we wish to point out that from eq .",
    "( 11 ) one can easily show that locations where @xmath57 exactly coincide with the sonic points of the flow .",
    "thus the number of extrema of @xmath58 is the same as that of the sonic points and hence the division in fig .",
    "1 could give an idea about the behavior of @xmath58 as well .",
    "a black hole accretion flow being transonic , it must satisfy two sonic point conditions at the cost of one extra unknown , namely , the the sonic point .",
    "because of this extra condition , out of the three constants of motion , namely , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , only two are to be supplied as free parameters . while computing shock locations , we used past experience derived from numerical methods , that only one of the shocks , namely @xmath62 ( c89 notation ) is stable , and accordingly our procedure as delineated below attempts to compute only this location .    the flow will have a shock only at the point where the shock invariant condition is satisfied . simplifying the shock invariant relation ( eq .",
    "18 ) , we obtain , 2(-1)(m^2_++m^2_-)-[(3 - 1)^2 - 2(3 - 1)(-1)]m^2_+m^2_-+4=0 .",
    "we consider a relativistic flow with @xmath63 so that the polytropic index @xmath64 . then from eq .",
    "( 22 ) , we obtain , 2(m^2_++m^2_- ) -21m^2_+m^2_- + 12=0 .",
    "we now expand the post - shock mach number @xmath65 by a polynomial which must satisfy the following conditions :    \\(a ) @xmath66 is zero at the central ` o'-type sonic point .",
    "this is a general property of the flow ( vide discussion at the end of last section ) .",
    "\\(b ) mach no .",
    "( @xmath67 ) at the location of the middle sonic point must match with that derived from approximate analytical solution obtained using the energy equation ( eq . 2 and 4a ) .",
    "\\(c ) solution must pass through the position where @xmath66 is @xmath68 and a good guess of this the location ( say , from the location of the sonic points ) is known .",
    "similarly , we expand @xmath69 by a polynomial which must satisfy the following conditions :    \\(a ) @xmath66 is zero at the outer sonic point ( location of which is already determined above ) .",
    "this is a general condition ( vide discussion at the end of the previous section ) .",
    "\\(b ) mach no . at the outer sonic point must match with the analytical value obtained from the sonic point condition ( eq .",
    "\\(c ) mach no .",
    "( @xmath70 ) at the location of the middle sonic point must match with the analytical value derived from approximate analytical solution obtained using the energy equation ( eq . 2 and 4a ) .",
    "keeping in mind that an algebraic equation which is beyond quartic can not be solved analytically [ see , @xcite ] , we expand @xmath71 as quadratic equations so that eq .",
    "( 23 ) may become quartic .",
    "we shall show a posteriori that such an assumption introduces a very small and tolerable error in our computation .",
    "if @xmath72 denotes the shock location , we assume , m^2_=^2_q=0 a_[q,]x^q_s where , @xmath73}$ ] are constant co - efficients to be determined from the conditions mentioned above .",
    "we find them to be ,    @xmath74}=\\frac { 1-\\left(m^2_{+}\\right)_{mid } } { ( x_{inf}-x_{mid})^2}$ ] ,    @xmath75}=-2x_{mid}a_{[2,+]}$ ] ,    @xmath76}=1+\\left ( 2x_{mid}x_{inf}-x^2_{inf}\\right)a_{[2,+]}$ ] ,    @xmath77}=\\frac { \\left ( m^2_{-}\\right)_{mid}-1}{(x_{out}-x_{mid})^2}$ ] ,    @xmath78}=-2x_{mid}a_{[2,-]}$ ] ,    @xmath79}=1+x^2_{out}a_{[2,-]}$ ] ,    where , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the middle ( o - type ) sonic point , the position where first derivative of mach no . is infinity and the outer sonic point respectively .",
    "we now substitute the above expression ( eq .",
    "24 ) for the mach number in the mach invariant relation ( eq .",

    "we solve this equation for @xmath91 analytically using the same procedure as in  4 ( details in appendix a ) .",
    "we denote the discriminant @xmath46 by @xmath92 , and @xmath93 and @xmath94 values as @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively for our discussion on the parameter space behavior of shocks .    in figure 2",
    ", we redraw the parameter space as in figure 1 , but consider the formation of shocks alone .",
    "we find that @xmath97 produces no shock from above , and @xmath98 with @xmath99 gives the boundary of the weakest shock ( shocks with unit compression ratio ) .",
    "this boundary , though obtained using our approximate analytical method , generally coincides with the dotted curve of figure 1 .",
    "the edge of the boundary is obtained with an extra condition @xmath100 .",
    "thus , @xmath96 progressively decreases towards the edge along the dashed curve .",
    "this edge ( denoted by @xmath101 ) ought to have coincided with the cusp of the @xmath50 curve drawn for the sonic point ( see , fig . 1 also ) ,",
    "had the analytical method been exact .",
    "a small shift is the evidence that a small error is present at this corner of the parameter space .",
    "we also provide the region of the oscillating shocks ( @xmath102 and @xmath103 ) . here",
    ", the shock location is imaginary and therefore shock continuously oscillates back and forth causing a very interesting astrophysical effect known as quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) .",
    "this would be discussed in the next section .",
    "the boundary between the shock and no - shock region from below is denoted by the dashed curve marked by @xmath104 . below the no - shock region where the energy and angular momentum of the flow are very low",
    ", the flow has only one sonic point .    in figure 3 , we draw shock location @xmath72 ( along y - axis ) as a function of energy ( along x - axis ) .",
    "different curves are drawn for different specific angular momentum of the flow .",
    "the rightmost one is for @xmath105 and the leftmost one is for @xmath106 , interval of @xmath61 is @xmath107 . as angular momentum",
    "is increased , the shock is located farther from the black hole . comparing the locations from those obtained analytically ,",
    "one notices that the same location is obtained for a specific angular momentum slightly more ( @xmath108% ) than that used in the numerical method .",
    "we therefore believe that the results obtained are very much reliable .    in figure 4 , we present a comparison of the boundary of the parameter space for which standing shocks may form as obtained by our analytical solution ( shaded region ) and by the numerical means ( solid curve ) existing in the literature ( c89 ) .",
    "the agreement is very good except in a region near the cusp ( as also noted while discussing fig .",
    "since very little parameter space is involved at this edge , we think that this small mismatch is tolerable .",
    "even though a black hole has no hard surface , it is remarkable that matter forms standing shocks around it in the same way as a shock is formed when a supersonic flow encounters a hard boundary .",
    "shock waves heat up a gas and puff it up .",
    "this post - shock region intercepts soft photons from the pre - shock matter , particularly from the keplerian disk which is located on the equatorial plane ( ct95 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the nature of the comptonized radiation depends on the amount of matter in the sub - keplerian and in the keplerian flow : if the intensity of soft photon is very low , they can not cool down the post - shock region by inverse compton process and the spectrum remains very hot . on the other hand , if the intensity of soft photon is very high ( i.e. , the keplerian rate is large ) , they cool down the post - shock region to the extent that the shock could not be sustained ( pressure balance condition breaks down ) .",
    "this produces a soft state spectrum with a hard tail due to bulk motion comptonization ( ct95 ) .",
    "there are several models in the literature which perhaps explain the soft / hard states . however , no model other than ct95 explains the power - law hard - tail in the soft state .",
    "similarly , when the question of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) come , shock - oscillation model turns out to be a sufficiently satisfactory one ( cm00 ) .    when the parameters fall in the ` no shock ' region of fig .",
    "2 , shock location becomes imaginary .",
    "however , three sonic points are still present and the entropy of the flow at the inner sonic point continues to be higher compared to that at the outer sonic point . in this case , shock starts oscillating with a time period ( @xmath109 ) comparable to the infall time from the post - shock region @xcite .",
    "even when shocks form , if the infall time - scale turns out to be comparable to the cooling time , then the resonance condition is satisfied @xcite and shocks oscillate in time scales of : @xmath110 where , @xmath111 is the infall velocity and @xmath94 is the compression ratio at the shock ( easily obtained analytically from our equations ) .",
    "observed qpo frequencies are comparable to @xmath112 .    when a mixture of keplerian and sub - keplerian matter is accreted , it is easy to obtain the parameters @xmath113 and @xmath59 in terms of the keplerian ( @xmath114 ) and sub - keplerian ( @xmath115 ) accretion rates .",
    "suppose , the viscosity parameter is such that the flow is deviated from a keplerian disk at @xmath116 where its energy and angular momentum were @xmath117 and @xmath118 respectively .",
    "further suppose that the sub - keplerian halo has a constant energy @xmath119 and constant angular momentum @xmath120 , then the average angular momentum and energy of the transonic flow would be , @xmath121 @xmath122 it is easy to compute the shock location of the resultant flow using our formalism given above .",
    "it is to be noted from fig .",
    "3 that shock solutions are allowed only if the specific energy is positive . in other words , if a flow deviates from a cool keplerian disk on the equatorial plane , the flow can not have shocks as the specific energy in such a flow would be negative unless this flow is mixed with a substantial amount of sub - keplerian matter with a positive energy . typically , @xmath123 and even with a small energy , the specific energy of the mixture becomes positive , giving rise to shocks and ( unbound ) winds . in the case",
    "when magnetic dissipation is present , flow energy could increase to a positive value and a solution with a shock would be allowed .",
    "the prospect of magnetic energy dissipation has been discussed by several workers in the literature @xcite . briefly , since the magnetic field rises as @xmath124 and therefore magnetic pressure rises as @xmath125 while the gas pressure in the sub - keplerian matter goes as @xmath126 , magnetic field in excess of the equipartition value would escape from the disk buoyantly and may dissipate at the atmosphere as in the case of the sun .",
    "if the flow has specific energy @xmath127 at , say @xmath128 where the flow was in equipartition , then at the shock , the energy would be at least @xmath129 times larger if _ all _ the magnetic energy is dissipated into the flow .",
    "thus , a basically free - fall matter of @xmath130 would have an energy @xmath131 and thus a shock at a few tens of schwarzschild radii would be expected .",
    "an accreting flow can intercept hard x - rays emitted at the inner edge and this pre - heating effect need not be negligible . for instance , a flow emitting isotropically with @xmath132 efficiency will definitely intercept @xmath133 fraction of radiation in between the shocked region and the keplerian disk . assuming @xmath134 , the energy deposition due to pre - heating is @xmath135 which is significant .",
    "this would energize keplerian matter as well and shocks in the sub - keplerian flow would be expected .",
    "so far in the astrophysical literature , existence of shocks in accretion flows has been indicated by steady and time - dependent numerical simulations .",
    "study of these standing and oscillatory shocks in an accretion flows has been shown to be of great importance .",
    "presently we show that the shocks could be studied completely analytically , at least in the case of thin , axisymmetric , inviscid flows with positive energy .",
    "we note that shock locations vary with flow parameters in a simple way  they form farther from a black hole when angular momentum is increased .",
    "this proves that they are mainly centrifugal pressure supported .",
    "given that the shocks , especially the standing shocks are the ideal locations at which a flow is heated up , hard x - rays are produced from the post - shock region after the soft - photons are processed by the flow by inverse - comptonization process .",
    "thus , the spectral states and the time - dependent behavior of the hard x - rays are directly related to the behavior of this region . for instance , ct95 computes steady state spectra with post - shock region as the source of hot , comptonizing electrons .",
    "cm00 establishes that qpos are due to oscillations of this region , since only hard x - rays are seen to exhibit qpos .",
    "we therefore believe that shocks should be an important ingredient of an accreting system",
    ". however , if the disk is cool and keplerian very far away , the specific energy must be negative .",
    "so the problem is not whether shocks should exist , the problem seems to be how to energize keplerian matter as it becomes sub - keplerian , by , say , magnetic energy dissipation , pre - heating etc .",
    "these work is in progress and would be reported elsewhere .    from the observers point of view",
    ", our work could also be useful , since the steady spectra , qpo frequencies , etc .",
    "are , in principle , determined analytically from a few free physical parameters . in future , we shall apply our understanding to obtain spectral properties and qpo behaviors more quantitatively .",

    "the procedure of obtaining an analytical solution of a quartic equation , @xmath136 is to first obtain a solution of the following cubic equation :                      one can now write a quadratic equation using any one of the real solutions of the cubic equation ( see , spiegel , 1968 ) as follows : @xmath154 this is a quadratic equation which can be solved easily . since we applied this procedure both of the sonic points and shocks , we denoted quantities like , @xmath46,@xmath93 and @xmath94 by @xmath47,@xmath155 and @xmath156 for sonic ( critical ) points and @xmath92,@xmath95 and @xmath96 for shocks respectively ."
