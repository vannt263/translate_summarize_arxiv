    "uncertainty relations date back to the work of weyl and heisenberg who showed that a signal can not be localized simultaneously in both time and frequency .",
    "this basic principle was then extended by landau , pollack , slepian and later donoho and stark to the case in which the signals are not restricted to be concentrated on a single interval @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty principle has deep philosophical interpretations .",
    "for example , in the context of quantum mechanics it implies that a particle s position and momentum can not be simultaneously measured . in harmonic analysis",
    "it imposes limits on the time - frequency resolution @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a surge of research into discrete uncertainty relations in more general finite - dimensional bases @xcite .",
    "this work has been spurred in part by the relationship between sparse representations and the emerging field of compressed sensing @xcite .",
    "in particular , several works have shown that discrete uncertainty relations can be used to establish uniqueness of sparse decompositions in different bases representations .",
    "furthermore , there is an intimate connection between uncertainty principles and the ability to recover sparse expansions using convex programming @xcite .",
    "the vast interest in representations in redundant dictionaries stems from the fact that the flexibility offered by such systems can lead to decompositions that are extremely sparse , namely use only a few dictionary elements .",
    "however , finding a sparse expansion in practice is in general a difficult combinatorial optimization problem .",
    "two fundamental questions at the heart of overcomplete representations are what is the smallest number of dictionary elements needed to represent a given signal , and how can one find the sparsest expansion in a computationally efficient manner . in recent years , several key papers have addressed both of these questions in a discrete setting , in which the signals to be represented are finite - length vectors @xcite .",
    "the discrete generalized uncertainty principle for pairs of orthonormal bases states that a vector in @xmath0 can not be simultaneously sparse in two orthonormal bases .",
    "the number of non - zero representation coefficients is bounded below by the inverse coherence @xcite .",
    "the coherence is defined as the largest absolute inner product between vectors in each basis @xcite .",
    "this principle has been used to establish conditions under which a convex @xmath1 optimization program can recover the sparsest possible decomposition in a dictionary consisting of both bases @xcite .",
    "these results where later generalized in @xcite to representations in arbitrary dictionaries and to other efficient reconstruction algorithms @xcite .",
    "the classical uncertainty principle is concerned with expanding a continuous - time analog signal in the time and frequency domains .",
    "however , the generalizations outlined above are mainly focused on the finite - dimensional setting . in this paper ,",
    "our goal is to extend these recent ideas and results to the analog domain by first deriving uncertainty relations for more general classes of analog signals and arbitrary analog dictionaries , and then suggesting concrete algorithms to decompose a continuous - time signal into a sparse expansion in an infinite - dimensional dictionary .    in our development , we focus our attention on continuous - time signals that lie in shift - invariant ( si ) subspaces of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "such signals can be expressed in terms of linear combinations of shifts of a finite set of generators : @xmath3\\phi_\\ell(t - nt),\\ ] ] where @xmath4 are the si generators , and @xmath5 $ ] are the expansions coefficients .",
    "clearly , @xmath6 is characterized by infinitely many coefficients @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the finite results which provide bounds on the number of non - zero expansion coefficients in pairs of bases decompositions are not immediately relevant here .",
    "instead , we characterize analog sparsity as the number of active generators that comprise a given representation , where the @xmath7th generator is said to be active if @xmath5,n \\in { { \\mathbb{z}}}$ ] is not identically zero .    starting with expansions in two orthonormal bases ,",
    "we show that the number of active generators in each representation obeys an uncertainty principle similar in spirit to that of finite decompositions .",
    "the key to establishing this relation is in defining an analog coherence between the two bases .",
    "our definition replaces the inner product in the finite setting by the largest spectral value of the sampled cross - correlation between basis elements , in the analog case .",
    "the similarity between the finite and infinite cases can also be seen by examining settings in which the uncertainty bound is tight . in the discrete scenario ,",
    "the lower uncertainty limit is achieved by decomposing a spike train into the spike and fourier bases , which are maximally incoherent @xcite . to generalize this result to the analog domain",
    "we first develop an analog spike - fourier pair and prove that it is maximally incoherent .",
    "the analog spike basis is obtained by modulations of the basic lowpass filter ( lpf ) , which is maximally spread in frequency . in the time domain ,",
    "these signals are given by shifts of the sinc function , whose samples generate shifted spikes .",
    "the discrete fourier basis is replaced by an analog fourier basis , in which the elements are frequency shifts of a narrow lpf in the continuous - time frequency domain .",
    "tightness of the uncertainty relation is demonstrated by expanding a train of narrow lpfs in both bases .",
    "we next address the problem of sparse decomposition in an overcomplete dictionary , corresponding to using more than @xmath8 generators in ( [ eq : model ] ) . in the finite setting , it can be shown that under certain conditions on the dictionary , a sparse decomposition can be found using computationally efficient algorithms such as @xmath1 optimization @xcite . however , directly generalizing this result to the analog setting is challenging .",
    "although in principle we can define an @xmath1 optimization program similar in spirit to its finite counterpart , it will involve infinitely many variables and constraints and therefore it is not clear how to solve it in practice .",
    "instead , we develop an alternative approach by exploiting recent results on analog compressed sensing @xcite , that leads to a finite - dimensional convex problem whose solution can be used to find the analog sparse decomposition .",
    "our algorithm is based on a three - stage process : in the first step we sample the analog signal ignoring the sparsity , and formulate the decomposition problem in terms of sparse signal recovery from the given samples . in the second stage ,",
    "we exploit results on infinite measurement models ( imv ) and multiple measurement vectors ( mmv ) @xcite in order to determine the active generators , by solving a finite - dimensional convex optimization problem .",
    "finally , we use this information to simultaneously solve the resulting infinite set of equations by inverting a finite matrix @xcite .",
    "our method works under certain technical conditions , which we elaborate on in the appropriate section .",
    "we also indicate how these results can be extended to more general classes of dictionaries .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sec : prob ] we review the generalized discrete uncertainty principle and introduce the class of analog signals we will focus on .",
    "the analog uncertainty principle is formulated and proved in section  [ sec : ur ] . in section  [ sec : example ] we consider a detailed example illustrating the analog uncertainty relation and its tightness . in particular",
    "we introduce the analog version of the maximally incoherent spike - fourier pair .",
    "sparse decompositions in two orthonormal analog bases are discussed in section  [ sec : rep ] .",
    "these results are extended to arbitrary dictionaries in section  [ sec : frame ] .    in the sequel",

    "this in turn implies that the sum of the squared elements of @xmath53 is equal to @xmath8 .",
    "since there are @xmath54 variables , the value of the largest can not be smaller than @xmath55 .",

    "this follows from the fact that the discrete fourier transform of @xmath11 is also a spike train with the same spacing .",
    "therefore , @xmath11 can be decomposed both in time and in frequency into @xmath57 basis vectors .    as we discuss in section  [ sec : rep ] , the uncertainty relation provides insight into how sparse a signal @xmath11 can be represented in an overcomplete dictionary consisting of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",

    "this choice of signal resembles the spike train which is known to achieve the uncertainty principle in the discrete setting .",
    "finally , we treated the problem of sparsely representing an analog signal in an overcomplete dictionary .",
    "building upon the uncertainty principle and recent works in the area of compressed sensing for analog signals , we showed that under certain conditions on the fourier domain representation of the dictionary , the sparsest representation can be found by solving a finite - dimensional convex optimization problem .",
    "the fact that sparse decompositions can be found by solving a convex optimization problem has been established in many previous works in compressed sensing in the finite setting .",
