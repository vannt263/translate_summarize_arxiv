    "the properties of galaxy clusters play an important role in constraining cosmological parameters and models of large - scale structure formation . because clusters are the most massive collapsed aggregates in the universe , the cluster mass function and its evolution with redshift constrains the spectrum of density fluctuations ( e.g. eke , cole & frenk 1996 , bahcall & cen 1992 ) .",
    "accurate cluster masses can also constrain the ratio of baryonic to total mass , and thus @xmath4 ( white et al . 1993 ) .",
    "there are several standard ways of computing cluster masses .",
    "optical redshift surveys yield a mass estimate through the application of the virial theorem , on the assumption that the galaxies trace the overall cluster mass distribution ; this method was first applied to coma by zwicky ( 1933 )",
    ". more sophisticated variants of this method include a surface term to account for the unsampled portion of the cluster ( the & white 1986 ) , and use the jeans equation to account for the effects of orbital anisotropy ( e.g. binney & tremaine 1987 ) . for clusters with many hundreds of redshifts , the distribution of infalling galaxies in redshift space measures the gravitational potential of the dark matter halo ( diaferio & geller 1997 ) ; this method has only been successfully applied to coma so far ( geller , diaferio & kurtz 1999 ) . observations of hot intracluster gas in the x - ray provide information about the gravitational potential ; the added assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium yields a mass ( bahcall & sarazin 1977 ) .",
    "gravitational lensing of background galaxies can also be used to estimate cluster masses ( webster 1985 , bartelmann et al .",
    "1996 and references therein ) .",
    "comparing cluster masses derived by these independent methods can provide insight into the internal structure of clusters ( loeb & mao 1994 ) and provides a consistency check on the mass derived by any one method .    while the distribution of total cluster masses constrains global cosmological parameters , knowledge of the density ( or equivalently , mass ) profiles of individual clusters constrains models of cluster formation .",
    "@xmath5-body simulations of hierarchical clustering by navarro , frenk & white ( 1995,1996,1997 , hereafter nfw ) suggest that a universal two - parameter density model can adequately describe clusters over a broad range of masses . until recently , few clusters had enough measured redshifts to constrain the mass profile ; the advent of multi - fiber spectrographs has now made it possible to measure several hundred redshifts in a cluster within a reasonable time .    our goal is to measure the mass profile of the cluster awm  7 , selected by albert et al .",

    "our sample consists of 179 cluster galaxies with measured redshifts ; this work expands the sample of koranyi et al .",

    "( 1998 ) , and fit a nfw mass profile from the projected distribution of radii for comparison with the virial mass profile ; we consider also the effect of orbital anisotropies ( still assuming the nfw profile ) on the mass estimates .",
    "the two profiles agree remarkably well within our restricted context ; the assumption of the nfw model produces self - consistent mass estimates using these two methods . relaxing the assumption that the galaxies trace an underlying nfw dark matter distribution would result in a larger range of admissible masses ( cf . the & white 1986 ) .    in  2 and  3",

    "we use @xmath6  km  s@xmath7  mpc@xmath7 throughout .",
    "we observed a total of 593 distinct targets in the direction of awm  7 from 1995 to 1999 .",
    "we measured redshifts for 492 objects ; 179 are cluster galaxies ( with redshifts in the range 25007500 km  s@xmath7 ) , making awm  7 one of the best - sampled clusters in the sky .",
    "our sample extends over 1.5 degrees in radius from the cluster center , and reaches magnitudes as faint as @xmath8 in the core .",
    "we collected data from three different telescopes , with different sky coverage and different magnitude limits ; we describe the details of each in turn . in each case",
    "we chose the spectral coverage so that both the ca h - k break at @xmath9   and h@xmath10 @xmath11   would fall on the detector at the cluster redshift .",

    "we observed 45 targets with the blue channel spectrograph of the mmt on the nights of 1996 dec . 5 and 6 , using a 2 arcsecond slit and a 300 line  mm@xmath7 grating , resulting in a resolution of @xmath010.6 and spectral coverage of 30008000  .",
    "these targets are in the central @xmath14 @xmath15  mpc ) of the cluster , and are complete to @xmath16 in that region .",
    "these data have been previously published in koranyi et al .",

    "we observed 250 targets ( under the queue observing scheme ) with the hydra multi - fiber bench spectrograph mounted on the wiyn telescope at kitt peak on the nights of 1998 dec .",
    "20 and 21 ; these data are new to this paper .",
    "there were 4 separate fiber configurations ; 60 objects were observed in more than one configuration .",
    "there were either four or five 25-minute exposures for each configuration .",
    "we used 3 arcsecond fibers , and a 400 line  mm@xmath7 grating , resulting in a resolution of @xmath07   and spectral coverage of 38007000  .",
    "the four configurations were observed under strongly varying conditions , resulting in dramatic differences in throughput .",
    "two of the configurations suffered from wind shake , and a third from cirrus .",
    "the remaining configuration was observed under stable , clear skies with good seeing and resulted in a redshift for almost every target .    in total , we were able to measure redshifts for 154 of the 250 targets ( 152 new ) , sometimes by combining spectra of the same object observed under different configurations .",
    "only 22 of these are cluster members .",
    "the hydra targets are all within the central @xmath17 of the cluster .",
    "the magnitude completeness of the hydra sample is complicated .",
    "not only were we unable to measure a redshift for every target , but the original target list itself did not include every galaxy ( up to some limit ) in a magnitude - ordered list because of physical constraints in allocating fibers to objects .",
    "moreover , the initial magnitude ranking was not by total galaxy luminosity , but rather by luminosity within the central 3 arcseconds subtended by the fibers",
    ". we will discuss the photometry and luminosity function of awm  7 in a later paper ; here , we are interested primarily in the kinematics of the cluster and the incompleteness is not a limitation on the analysis .",
    "we reduced all spectra using the * xcsao * task of the rvsao package in iraf ( kurtz & mink 1998 ) . *",
    "xcsao * measures redshifts by cross - correlating the observed spectra against a suite of template spectra .",
    "the quality of the match is measured by the parameter @xmath18 , an estimate of the ratio of the highest peak to the average noise peak in the correlation function .",
    "the template spectra are themselves empirically derived from an archive of fast observations , and are thus strictly speaking directly applicable only to other fast spectra . for the fast velocities , the instrumental velocity offset with respect to the night sky lines is less than 10 km  s@xmath7 and is indistinguishable from zero ( kurtz & mink 1998 ) .",
    "we have found that the fast template spectra are reliable also for the mmt and hydra spectra ; for those objects observed with several spectrographs , the redshifts derived from the separate spectra all agree within the errors .",
    "many of the hydra spectra have very low signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "we assess the robustness of the redshifts as follows : for each object , we construct all @xmath19 possible ( non - zero ) combinations of spectra from the @xmath5 individual exposures .",
    "@xmath5 is 4 or 5 for most objects , and 8 , 9 or 10 for objects observed in two configurations .",
    "for the few objects observed in 3 configurations , with @xmath5 as large as 13 , we examine only a subset of the 8191 possible combinations .",
    "we measure the redshift independently from each of these combined spectra .",
    "we accept a redshift for a target only if the following criteria all hold : ( 1 ) the @xmath18-value increases with the number of individual spectra contained in the combined spectrum ; ( 2 ) the velocity of the combined spectra stabilizes as the number of constituent individual spectra increases ; ( 3 ) the best combined spectrum has an @xmath18-value @xmath203 .",
    "the comparatively narrow spectral range of the hydra observations means that h@xmath10 is shifted off the edge of the detector for @xmath21  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "cross - correlating emission line galaxies at these redshifts with the standard emission - line template results in a spurious redshift because the strongest remaining line in the spectrum is usually fit to h@xmath10 .",
    "we solved this problem by constructing a new template that differs from the standard emission - line template only by the absence of the h@xmath10-nitrogen complex and the @xmath22  6717,6731   sulfur lines .",
    "we add an extra term of 65  km  s@xmath7 in quadrature to the errors of velocities determined from emission - line templates because the line emitting region may be offset in velocity from the systemic velocity of the galaxy ( kurtz & mink 1998 ) .",
    "emission - line galaxies preferentially yield redshifts because an emission - line galaxy can be robustly matched to an emission template even when the signal - to - noise in the continuum is too low for a believable correlation with an absorption template .",
    "thus , the completeness limit for emission - line galaxies is effectively fainter than for galaxies with no emission . the hydra configuration observed through cirrus yielded few redshifts , resulting in a brighter effective magnitude limit ; this effect is minor because there is considerable overlap on the sky among the four configurations .",
    "we divide our spectra into two broad classes , emission ( em ) and absorption ( ab ) , based on the presence or absence of h@xmath10 in the spectrum .",
    "h@xmath10 is `` present '' if its equivalent width exceeds 5 .",
    "the robustness of this criterion is clearly a function of the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectrum ; galaxies with low signal or with intrinsically weak h@xmath10 emission may be misclassified as absorption - line galaxies if the h@xmath10 peak does not rise appreciably above the noise .",
    "the misclassification is all in one direction : although some emission line galaxies may be misclassified as absorption , no absorption - line galaxy will be mistakenly classified as having emission .",
    "figure  [ fig : velhist ] ( upper panel ) shows the velocity distribution of all the observed galaxies . the cluster awm  7 , defined as in koranyi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to consist of galaxies with redshifts in the range 25007500 km  s@xmath7 , is cleanly and unambiguously distinguished from the background .",
    "the lower panel shows the velocity histogram of the cluster galaxies only ; the solid histogram indicates the distribution of the entire sample , and the shaded histogram indicates the em galaxies alone .",
    "our cluster sample consists of 179 galaxies ; we classify 42 as em and 137 as ab .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test indicates that the probability of the em and ab samples being so discrepant if drawn from the same distribution is small @xmath23 ; we conclude that the underlying distributions are different at the @xmath04@xmath24 confidence level .",
    "we compute the mean velocity and dispersion for the different galaxy populations following the prescription of danese , de zotti , & di tullio ( 1980 ) ; the results are in table  [ tab : velhist ] .",
    "the em galaxies have a much larger dispersion ( @xmath01100 km  s@xmath7  vs. @xmath0600 km  s@xmath7 ) , and are systematically offset in redshift by @xmath0400 km  s@xmath7  from the ab population ( 4800 km  s@xmath7  vs. 5200 km  s@xmath7 ) .",
    "the extrema of the em galaxies velocity histogram are almost equidistant from the ab mean velocity , but near 3800 km  s@xmath7there is an excess of em galaxies above the otherwise almost uniform distribution ; this excess decreases the mean redshift . neither the 17 em galaxies with @xmath25 km  s@xmath7nor the 12 with @xmath26 km  s@xmath7evince any strong clustering on the sky .",
    "absent independent distance measurements to these galaxies , it is difficult to determine whether they are foreground interlopers , or whether the cluster em galaxy population is indeed offset in velocity .    the cd galaxy near the cluster center",
    ", ngc  1129 , has a redshift of @xmath27  km  s@xmath7 , which , within the errors , is at rest with respect to the absorption - line galaxy population .",
    "the peak of the rosat pspc hard x - ray emission map , defined as the center of the pixel containing the greatest flux , is @xmath28 from the nominal position of ngc  1129 .",
    "we therefore adopt its position , @xmath2902:54:27.50 , + 41:34:42.50 ) , as the center of the cluster .",
    "figure  [ fig : skypos ] shows the distribution of galaxies with measured redshifts on the sky .",
    "open circles and filled triangles denote ab and em galaxies in the cluster , respectively ; crosses denote foreground or background galaxies .",
    "we do not plot targets for which we were unable to measure a redshift .",
    "the enhancement in the surface number density near the center of the cluster is due to the fainter magnitude limit reached by the mmt and hydra observations ; most hydra targets turned out to be background sources .",
    "the em galaxies are distributed much more uniformly on the sky than the ab galaxies ; the projected surface density of the ab galaxies increases strongly toward the center , but the em galaxies show no such enhancement .",
    "a two - dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov test ( press et al . 1992 ) indicates that the probability of drawing two such discrepant samples from the same underlying distribution is less than @xmath30 .",
    "the distribution of ab galaxies is strongly flattened ; there is a pronounced elongation in the east - west direction .",
    "the x - ray emission from awm  7 is similarly elongated ; mohr et al .",
    "( 1995 ) compute an axial ratio of @xmath31 at a position angle of @xmath32 from the x - ray flux within @xmath33 of the cluster center , in perfect agreement with the value of 0.67 computed by dellantonio et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for an isothermal ellipsoid model density distribution .",
    "mohr et al . ( 1995 ) report x - ray ellipticities for 58 clusters ; awm  7 is more flattened than both the mean and median clusters , but there are 10 clusters that are more flattened still . in our case",
    "it is difficult to measure the flattening quantitatively from our optical sample for comparison with the x - ray results because the completeness limit varies across our survey .    redshifts of cluster galaxies plotted against distance from the cluster center define a trumpet - shaped locus delimited by caustics ( kaiser 1987 ) .",
    "galaxies inside the caustics are bound to the cluster ; those outside are unbound .",
    "we construct such a plot in figure  [ fig : posvel ] ( top panel ) ; again , squares are ab galaxies and triangles are em galaxies .",
    "although one can discern by eye where the caustics probably lie , they are in practice poorly defined .",
    "their accurate determination requires many more galaxies than our sample contains ( diaferio 1999 , diaferio & geller 1997 , geller , diaferio & kurtz 1999 ) .    from the velocity histograms and the position - velocity diagrams",
    "it is clear that the em and ab galaxies are not equivalent tracers of the cluster mass .",
    "a friends - of - friends algorithm ( huchra & geller 1982 ) for finding substructure suggests that many of the em galaxies are contained in smaller subgroups distinct from the main cluster ( not shown ) ; these may be accreting onto the cluster now , and , not yet being virialized , do not follow the dark matter distribution as closely as the ab galaxies .",
    "there is considerable radial segregation of ab and em galaxies ; the radial distribution of em galaxies is more uniform and has a greater mean and median distance from the cluster center than that of the ab galaxies .",
    "this behavior is observed in other clusters ( mohr et al .",
    "1996 , adami et al .",
    "1998 ) , in groups ( mahdavi et al . 1999 ) , and in the field as the morphology - density relation ( dressler 1980 ) .",
    "moreover , the velocity dispersion of the em galaxies remains large with increasing radius while that of the ab galaxies declines ( see  5 ) .",
    "these considerations suggest that the em galaxies are not virialized tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution . because our goal is an accurate determination of the mass profile",
    ", we exclude the em galaxies from further analysis , following mohr et al .",
    "we will revisit the issue of substructure in and around awm  7 and other poor clusters in a subsequent paper .",
    "figure  [ fig : posvel ] ( middle panel ) shows the velocity dispersion profile constructed only from the ab galaxies .",
    "we sort the galaxies by distance from the cluster center , then evaluate the velocity dispersion in a sliding bin containing 11 galaxies ; we plot the dispersion as a function of the mean distance to the galaxies in the bin .",
    "neighboring points are strongly correlated , as they share 10 of their 11 galaxies ; every 11th point ( distinguished by error bars ) is independent .    two large excursions from the overall trend",
    "dominate the profile .",
    "two outlier galaxies , one at projected distance @xmath34  @xmath1  mpc  and low velocity , the other at @xmath35  @xmath1  mpc  and high velocity ( circled in the top panel of the figure ) produce these excursions .",
    "it is clear that these two galaxies are responsible because the number of data points in each excursion equals the width of the sliding bin used to compute the profile .",
    "we therefore define a subset of the ab sample , ab@xmath36 , excluding these two galaxies .",
    "we shall henceforth refer to the entire sample of 137 ab galaxies as ab@xmath37 .",
    "the velocity dispersion profile for ab@xmath36 appears in the lower panel ; the overall dispersion of these 135 galaxies is @xmath38  km  s@xmath7within @xmath39  @xmath1  mpc . after some fluctuations near the core ,",
    "the profile becomes smooth and shows the characteristic declining profile seen in poor groups by mahdavi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and in some @xmath5-body simulations ( e.g. crone , evrard & richstone 1994 ) .",
    "the decline in dispersion at small radii matches that of the `` type  c '' clusters of girardi et al .",
    "we revisit the issue of the cold core in  6 .",
    "we compute the mass profile of awm  7 in two largely independent ways .",
    "first , we assume that the mass profile follows the functional form predicted by the hierarchical clustering simulations of navarro , frenk & white ( 1995,1996,1997 ) .",
    "this model has two parameters which we derive separately from the observations under the assumption that the ab galaxies are virialized and that they trace the dark matter distribution . while this is a restrictive assumption ,",
    "there is growing evidence that the nfw profile is applicable beyond the hierarchical clustering regime in which it was proposed .",
    "huss , jain & steinmetz ( 1999 ) find from high - resolution @xmath5-body simulations that virialized dark matter halos with different formation histories nevertheless evince similar density and velocity dispersion profiles , and that this `` universal '' density profile is well described by the functional form of the nfw model .",
    "the collapse history of the cluster seems immaterial in determining the ultimate cluster profile .",
    "more concretely , geller , diaferio & kurtz ( 1999 ) show that this profile describes the coma cluster well for @xmath40 @xmath1  mpc . for comparison",
    ", we also fit a non - singular isothermal sphere to awm  7 .",
    "we also compute the mass profile from the virial theorem alone . at small radii , this method gives incorrect results if not corrected for the exclusion of the outer cluster regions from the computation .",
    "the mass profile can be corrected with a surface term , which depends on both the mass and velocity dispersion profiles .",
    "these last two profiles are linked to the velocity anisotropy profile through the jeans equation ( e.g. binney & tremaine 1987 ) , but the data are insufficient to constrain the problem completely .",
    "usually one makes some assumptions about one or more of the profiles and solves for the others ( e.g. binney & mamon 1982 , the & white 1986 , binney & tremaine 1987 , girardi et al .",
    "1998 ) . here",
    ", we make these assumptions only for the computation of the surface term correction to the virial mass estimator .",
    "the spherically symmetric nfw density distribution is @xmath41 resulting in the enclosed mass profile @xmath42    \\label{eq : nfwm}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the critical density of the universe , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the two parameters of the model , corresponding to the overall normalization and the core radius , respectively . the radial scale in the context of cluster simulations is often quoted in units of @xmath46 , the radius where the mean cluster density has dropped to 200@xmath43 .",
    "nfw claim , on the basis of numerical experiments , that this radius approximately separates the virialized and infall regions ( see also cole & lacey 1996 ) .",

    "a simple dynamical argument suggests that cold cores arise naturally from the nfw density profile . assuming virial equilibrium to hold in the core , @xmath127 . modeling the density profile at small radii as a power law @xmath128 yields @xmath129 , so @xmath130 . for the nfw profile @xmath131 in the core ,",
    "resulting in a rising velocity dispersion profile .    because the velocity dispersion profile , mass profile , and orbital anisotropy profile are coupled through the jeans equation , it is difficult to derive a mass profile without making some assumptions about the form of one or more of these functions along the way .",
    "the projected velocity dispersion profile is directly observable , but it is sensitive to outliers and substructure , and requires either extensive smoothing or a large number of galaxies for a robust determination .",
    "the anisotropy profile is also difficult to constrain , with some evidence for a variety of profiles possible in clusters ( girardi et al .",
    "the mass profile can be estimated from x - ray observations , but these tend to have few data points , large errors , and cover only the inner regions of clusters ; consequently , they can be fit by a wide range of models , resulting in large uncertainties in mass when extrapolated to large cluster radii .",
    "it seems difficult to avoid circular logic in computing the surface term , as it depends on both the anisotropy profile and the density distribution that one is trying to determine .",
    "one can make a self - consistency argument , as we do here , to verify that the assumed density profile used to correct the virial mass profile agrees with the virial profile so corrected ; if the surface term were small , this circularity would be less troublesome , because the assumed density profile would affect the virial mass profile only through that small correction .",
    "but as fig .",
    "[ fig : surfterm ] illustrates , the surface term correction is often significant , particularly at small radii .",
    "not only is the correction large , but it is also uncertain , sensitive to uncertainty in the anisotropy profile alone .",
    "the coupling between the mass profile and the surface term is thus quite strong ; even with the assumption of a density profile ( which in principle renders the whole exercise redundant because the mass profile is then already known ) , the surface term correction is too poorly constrained to produce a reliable mass profile . only at the edges of the cluster",
    "does the surface term correction become reliable , but by then it is no longer very important .",
    "accurate determination of cluster masses from the virial estimator , then , requires broad angular coverage ; dense sampling of the core is not enough .",
    "we derive the mass profile of awm  7 in two independent ways from an optical sample of 179 galaxies with redshifts within 1.7 @xmath1  mpc  of the cluster center ; we use only the 137 absorption - line galaxies ( and a 135-element subset of them ) in the analysis .",
    "one method uses the surface number density and global velocity dispersion ; the other uses individual velocities and pairwise distances . both assume and underlying nfw profile .",
    "the two methods yield remarkably consistent mass estimates , particularly at the outer limit of our sample ; the enclosed mass within a projected radius of 1.7 @xmath1  mpc  agrees within 15% for both samples .",
    "the mass estimates are sensitive to the inclusion of two outliers in the sample ; both the nfw and virial masses increase by @xmath015% when they are included . including the em galaxies , with their larger dispersion , in the calculation results in a virial mass larger by a factor of two .",
    "the cluster mass within 1.7  @xmath1  mpc  is @xmath0@xmath132  @xmath133m@xmath3 .",
    "the surface term correction to the virial mass estimator is sensitive to noise in the velocity dispersion profile and to the assumed velocity anisotropy profile .",
    "the surface term at small radii is too unreliable for the virial mass estimator to be used for measuring mass profiles ; at large radii , where the surface term is more certain , it is no longer an important correction to the enclosed mass .",
    "the virial mass estimator is thus reliable for measuring total cluster masses , but not enclosed mass profiles ; to overcome the limitations of the surface term at small radii , cluster redshift samples must have broad angular coverage .",
    "dense sampling of cluster cores can reduce the scatter in the surface term if there are enough galaxies in the core , but our experience with awm  7 ( 22 cluster members out of 154 hydra redshifts ) suggests that telescope time is better spent probing the outskirts of the cluster .    untangling",
