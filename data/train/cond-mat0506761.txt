    "spintronics in molecular conductors is a field attracting more and more attention , both from fundamental physics as well as from application - oriented material science @xcite . here",
    "the quantum - mechanical electronic spin is the central object controlling transport properties . for a conductor sandwiched between ferromagnetic leads ,",
    "a different resistance can be observed depending on the relative orientation of the lead magnetizations . quite often , the resistance is larger in the antiparallel configuration than in the parallel one , but sometimes also the reverse situation can be observed .",
    "it is useful to define the tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) , @xmath1 , as the relative difference between the corresponding resistances .",
    "a particularly interesting material in that context is provided by carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) , see refs .",
    "@xcite for general reviews .",
    "quite a number of experimental studies concerning spin transport through individual multi- ( mwnt ) or single - walled ( swnt ) nanotubes contacted by ferromagnetic leads have been reported over the past few years @xcite .",
    "in particular , the experiments of the basel group @xcite use thin - film pdni alloys as ferromagnetic leads in order to contact either swnts or mwnts , where the shape anisotropy and the geometry of the setup allow for the study of the spin - dependence of electrical transport .",
    "these experiments have revealed _ oscillatory _ behavior of the tmr as a function of the external gate voltage .",
    "similar oscillations were predicted as a consequence of the gate - voltage - tunable rashba spin - orbit ( so ) interaction @xcite in a classic paper by datta and das some time ago @xcite .",
    "since datta - das oscillations have still not been observed experimentally so far , a thorough theoretical investigation of this effect in nanotubes is called for and provided here . unfortunately , from our analysis below , we find that the weakness of so couplings in nanotubes excludes an interpretation of these data in terms of the datta - das effect  they can , however , be explained in terms of quantum interference effects @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we show that the presence of multiple bands in cnts is not detrimental , and under certain circumstances , the effect may be sufficiently enhanced to be observable , e.g. , by a tuning of the number of bands via external gates along the lines of ref .  @xcite . in the original datta - das proposal @xcite , subband mixing was ignored so that different channels just add up coherently , but subband mixing has later been argued to spoil the effect @xcite . in cnts ,",
    "the special band structure requires a careful re - examination of the datta - das idea in this context , and we shall show that the arguments of refs .",
    "@xcite do not necessarily apply here .",
    "recent theoretical studies of spin - dependent transport in cnts have mainly focused on the single - channel limit , taking into account electron - electron interactions within the framework of the luttinger liquid theory @xcite ( see also @xcite for related discussions on interacting quantum wires with rashba so coupling ) . here",
    "we confine ourselves to the noninteracting problem in order to not overly complicate the analysis , but study the many - band case and details of the band structure .",
    "interactions can be taken into account within the luttinger liquid approach at a later stage , and may enhance the effect of so couplings @xcite .",
    "we shall also neglect disorder effects .",
    "mean free paths in high - quality swnts typically exceed @xmath2 m , while in mwnts this may be a more severe approximation for some samples . however , high - quality mwnts with ultra - long mean free paths have also been reported recently @xcite .",

    "[ sec2 ] we derive the rashba spin - orbit hamiltonian from microscopic considerations .",
    "the resulting tight - binding so hamiltonian will be studied at low energy scales in sec .",

    "[ sec4 ] , the consequences with regard to datta - das oscillations in the tmr are analyzed .",
    "we shall always consider the zero - temperature limit , and ( in most of the paper ) put @xmath3 .",
    "we start by noting that transport effectively proceeds through the outermost shell of a mwnt only , such that we can take a single - shell model even when dealing with a mwnt .",
    "experimentally and theoretically , it is understood that such a model works very well in good - quality mwnts @xcite , essentially because only the outermost shell is electrically contacted and tunneling between different shells is largely suppressed @xcite .",
    "naturally , a single - shell description is also appropriate for swnts , where we assume a sufficiently large radius @xmath4 such that occupation of multiple subbands can be possible .",
    "( for a mwnt , @xmath4 denotes the radius of the outermost shell . )",
    "depending on the electrochemical potential @xmath5 ( doping level ) , we then have to deal with @xmath0 spin - degenerate bands .",
    "we assume full quantum coherence ( no dephasing ) , so that the usual landauer - bttiker approach applies , and exclude external magnetic fields or electric field inhomogeneities , say , due to the electrodes . we proceed to derive the rashba so interaction , @xmath6 , for this problem .",
    "notice that this is different from the intrinsic atomic so interaction discussed in refs .",
    "in particular , the so coupling in refs .",
    "@xcite vanishes in the limit of large radius , which is not the case for the rashba so coupling we discuss below . though ando s so coupling @xcite could straightforwardly be included in our analysis , being gate - voltage independent it could not change our conclusions relative to the gate - voltage dependent oscillations in the magnetoresistance and is neglected in what follows .",
    "we first define a fixed reference frame @xmath7 , with unit vector @xmath8 pointing in the axis direction and @xmath9 perpendicular to the substrate on which the cnt is supposed to be located .",
    "next we introduce a second , local reference frame @xmath10 relative to each lattice site @xmath11 on the tube surface , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are unit vectors along the local normal and tangential ( around the circumference ) directions at @xmath11 , respectively . using polar coordinates in the plane transverse to the tube axis ,",

    ", external gates generally produce an electric field perpendicular to the tube axis and the substrate .",
    "as it has been shown in detail in previous works @xcite , polarization effects of the cnt itself due to a transverse field result in a reduction of the externally applied field described by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the unscreened transverse static polarizability .",
    "since @xmath35 is approximately proportional to @xmath36 , the factor in front of @xmath37 practically equals a constant , @xmath38 @xcite .",

    "@xmath40 acting in spin space , @xmath41    we proceed to derive the second - quantized spin - orbit hamiltonian within the tight - binding approximation . for that purpose , we need the matrix element of the momentum operator between two @xmath26 orbitals @xmath42 , from which we get the following form for the so hamiltonian : @xmath43 c_j , \\ ] ] where the fermionic operator @xmath44 destroys an electron with spin @xmath45 in the @xmath26 orbital centered at @xmath11 , and @xmath46 . for calculational convenience , the matrix element @xmath47 can be written as @xmath48 , where the spin - orbit vectors @xmath49 and @xmath50 are defined as @xmath51 note that the modulus of @xmath49 and @xmath50 has dimension of energy , and their sum ( but not necessarily each term separately ) is antisymmetric under exchange of @xmath32 and @xmath52 .",

    "the relation of these 1d fermions with the original operator @xmath166 is given by @xmath187 notice that , while in general the unitary transformation from sublattice space to the conduction / valence band description depends on longitudinal momentum , in the continuum limit , one can use the transformation directly at the fermi momenta .",
    "this is consistent with the neglect of band curvature effects implicit in the linearization of the dispersion relation , which is unproblematic away from van hove singularities associated with the onset of new subbands @xcite . at these points , the concept of @xmath186-movers breaks down , and some of our conclusions below may change .",
    "next we express the rashba hamiltonian ( [ soham ] ) in terms of @xmath186-movers .",

    "this term contains a rapidly oscillating factor @xmath190 and therefore is strongly suppressed by momentum conservation . the second term in eq .  ( [ soham ] )",
    "again contains the oscillating phase factor @xmath191 , which leads to a drastic suppression of @xmath192 at low energies and long wavelengths .",
    "of course , this argument relies in an essential way on the smallness of the coupling @xmath123 , as one expands around the hamiltonian @xmath167 .",
    "we conclude that away from van hove singularities , the only important rashba term is given by @xmath193 in eq .",
    "( [ rasb ] ) .",
    "this term has the appearance of a static homogeneous but _ channel - dependent magnetic field_.",
    "in this section we will analyze the consequences of our findings regarding spin - orbit couplings in cnts , see eqs .",
    "( [ rasb ] ) , for the observability of spin precession effects encoded in the datta - das oscillations of the tmr . based on our expressions , it is possible to estimate the order of magnitude of this effect .    for a concrete estimate ,",
    "let us put @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is the gate - tube distance , @xmath196 the gate voltage , and @xmath197 denotes the dielectric constant of the substrate . for a given channel @xmath147 , the rashba - induced energy splitting is then easily estimated as @xmath198 where @xmath199  m is the compton length . plugging in the definition of @xmath200 , we get @xmath201 bands with small @xmath147 are only weakly split , and hence do not contribute to oscillatory tmr behavior .",
    "this argument suggests that datta - das oscillations in principle could survive in a cnt , even when there are many channels .",
    "the major contribution will come just from the few bands with the largest @xmath147 .    to estimate the accumulated phase difference due to the different precession length of the two split eigenstates ,",
    "let us put @xmath202 , which represents the dominant contribution , and set @xmath203 .",
    "then eq .  ( [ splitting ] ) gives as order - of - magnitude estimate @xmath204 even when assuming a very close - by gate , this gives only a tiny splitting , in retrospect justifying perturbation theory .",
    "this splitting now translates into a momentum splitting @xmath205 , and hence into a precession phase mismatch along the cnt of length @xmath206 @xcite . for the @xmath147th band",

    "away from a van hove singularity , eq .  ( [ phase ] ) predicts that oscillations appear on a gate voltage scale of the order of @xmath209 to @xmath210  v for @xmath211 , which would make datta - das oscillations unobservable .",
    "this argument also shows that this interpretation can be ruled out for the parameters relevant for the basel experiment @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ phase ] ) , we can then suggest several ways to improve the situation .",
    "first , one should use very long cnts , while at the same time keeping the gate very close , and second , an enhancement can be expected close to van hove singularities . of course , very close to a van hove singularity , some of our arguments above break down , but the general tendency can nevertheless be read off from eq .",
    "( [ phase ] ) .",
    "furthermore , electron - electron interactions can also enhance spin - orbit effects @xcite .    to conclude",
    ", we have presented a detailed microscopic derivation of rashba spin - orbit coupling in carbon nanotubes .",
    "it turns out that the rashba so coupling is small , and therefore the prospects for observing spin - precession effects like datta - das oscillations in the tunneling magnetoresistance are not too favorable .",
    "however , for very long cnts , close - by gates , and in the vicinity of a van hove singularity , the requirements for observability of these effects could be met in practice .",
