    "we conjecture that @xmath229 is an invariant functional similar to ( [ 1.1 ] ) and is constructed from intrinsic and extrinsic geometrical structures of @xmath16 .",
    "let us emphasize that the bulk geometries @xmath164 , @xmath16 are the same as in the ryu - takayanagi setup and they do not depend , therefore , on the order parameter @xmath1 .",
    "it is the form of the functional which is allowed to contain @xmath1 .",
    "this differs our approach from the recent conjecture of @xcite where @xmath1 enters the metric of the bulk solutions .    the simplest case which illustrates our idea is the holographic formula for rnyi entropy of a 2d cft .",
    "one can check that the following area functional : @xmath230 reproduces ( [ 6.6a ] ) if we choose @xmath231 .      to find a holographic representation of the rnyi entropy in 4d cft we also need an invariant functional dual to @xmath36 , see ( [ 6.9 ] ) .",
    "the problem is that @xmath36 is an integral of the scalar curvature of @xmath12 .",
    "this integral is a topological invariant only in @xmath44 when @xmath12 has dimension 2 . in other dimensions",
    "@xmath36 is neither topological nor weyl invariant . on the other hand ,",
    "the pbh transformations require that liner combinations of curvatures in ads in any dimension correspond to weyl invariant structures on the boundary , as in case of eqs .",
    "( [ 7.12])-([7.14 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the bulk functional corresponding to @xmath36 can not be among local invariants linear in curvatures . the only local structure which produces @xmath36 is the volume @xmath15 , see ( [ 7.9 ] ) .",
    "however , the coefficient by @xmath15 is fixed by the leading ( area ) term in ere .    by taking this into account one",
    "should look for _ non - local _ bulk functionals .",
    "for example , for ere with entangling surface @xmath12 having topology of @xmath104 ( @xmath141 ) one can choose @xmath237 equation ( [ 7.9 ] ) can be used to show that @xmath238 certainly , ( [ 7.23 ] ) is not a single option and other non - local structures are possible .",
    "the choice of ( [ 7.23 ] ) seems to be the simplest .",
    "the logarithmic term in a holographic ere is similar to logarithmic corrections to the bekenstein - hawking entropy , which are a rather common consequence of quantum effects , see e.g. @xcite-@xcite .",
    "now one can check with the help of ( [ 7.9 ] ) , ( [ 7.17 ] ) , ( [ 7.18 ] ) , and ( [ 7.24 ] ) that the following functional : @xmath239 @xmath240 @xmath241 @xmath242 reproduces ( [ 6.6 ] ) , ( [ 6.8 ] ) , ( [ 6.11 ] ) , ( [ 6.10 ] ) at large @xmath225 .",

    "coincides with ryu - takayanagi formula ( [ 1.1 ] ) in the limit @xmath245 .",
    "it is also important to note that @xmath246 , like ( [ 1.1 ] ) , depends only on low - energy constants @xmath247 and @xmath190 which enter gravity action ( [ 7.1 ] ) .",
    "0    we suggest ( [ 7.21 ] ) as a holographic formula for the entanglement rnyi entropy .",
    "one should emphasize that @xmath229 reproduces at least the divergent part ( [ 1.2 ] ) of ere in the conformal theory in four dimensions .",
    "thus , additional terms may be needed in @xmath229 to go beyond the given approximation .",
    "one may note some differences between ( [ 7.21 ] ) and ryu - takayanagi expression ( [ 1.1 ] ) . unlike ( [ 1.1 ] ) , the form of @xmath229 explicitly depends on the dimension @xmath11 .",
    "this can be seen by comparing ( [ 7.21 ] ) with a possible formula of holographic ere for 2d cft , see ( [ 7.21a ] ) . in ( [ 7.21a ] ) the leading term remains finite in the limit @xmath248 while in ( [ 7.21 ] ) the volume term vanishes .",
    "another distinction between ( [ 1.1 ] ) and ( [ 7.21 ] ) is that the minimal hypersurface @xmath16 is not an exact extremal hypersurface for functional ( [ 7.21 ] ) .",

    "this term depends only on the volume @xmath15 .",
    "however @xmath229 includes also terms with @xmath250 and @xmath251 which depend on curvatures .",
    "let us emphasize that the choice of @xmath16 as an argument in the holographic ere functional was crucial for finding the correspondence between bulk and boundary quantities .    what happens if @xmath16 is replaced by a genuine extremal surface ?",
    "let us define ( [ 7.21 ] ) on a set of codimension 2 hypersurfaces @xmath252 in @xmath164 specified by the same boundary condition as @xmath16 , that is @xmath253 .",
    "such hypersurfaces have infinitely large volume in the limit @xmath254 .",
    "we also require that for @xmath252 the following restrictions are satisfied at @xmath199 : @xmath255 and @xmath256 .",
    "these restrictions allow @xmath16 to belong to the given set .",
    "they also guarantee that terms with @xmath250 and @xmath251 in functional @xmath257 are small compared to the volume term . to see",
    "this one should take into account that main contributions to integrals are picked up in a neighborhood of @xmath258 .",
    "suppose that @xmath257 has an extremum on some hypersurface @xmath252 from the considered set .",
    "extremal hypersurfaces may depend on @xmath1 , in general . since terms with @xmath250 and @xmath251 are small one can represent @xmath252 as @xmath16 with a small perturbation , @xmath259 . up to terms which are of the second order in the perturbation , @xmath260 .",
    "the second order terms are given by some ( non - local ) functional on @xmath16 quadratic in curvatures which enter @xmath250 and @xmath251 .",
    "it is important that the second order terms are small compared to @xmath229 .",
    "therefore , once @xmath229 is used to reproduce ere only in the logarithmic approximation it is safe to replace it with the extremal value @xmath257 .",
    "the entanglement rnyi entropy @xmath246 can be defined by formula ( [ 2.4 ] ) in terms of an entanglement partition function @xmath57 .",
    "it is interesting to discuss if there is a holographic representation for @xmath57 which results in functional @xmath229 .",
    "we use a line of reasonings suggested in @xcite to show that such a representation may be possible .",

    "the boundary condition does not fix @xmath268 uniquely . by taking @xmath1 identical copies of @xmath164 with the same cut @xmath268 and gluing them along the cuts one gets a space @xmath264 with the required boundary condition @xmath270 .",

    "other class of geometries which contribute to ( [ 8.2 ] ) and are regular in the bulk one should use another action .",
    "one should also note that ( [ 8.7 ] ) does not coincide with a classical action ( [ 7.1 ] ) naively taken on @xmath264 . in this case",
    "one would not get in ( [ 8.7 ] ) @xmath249 , @xmath250 and @xmath251 terms .",

    "variations of the two terms in ( [ 8.7 ] ) are required to vanish independently .",
    "variations of @xmath279 $ ] are subject to certain boundary conditions near conical singularities to preserve their structure .",
    "they result in the standard bulk gravity equations for ( [ 7.1 ] ) .",
    "that is , locally @xmath264 is one of solutions of ads gravity .",
    "minimization of @xmath257 implies that @xmath252 is an extremal hypersurface , thus , in the leading approximation we recover the holographic entanglement entropy @xmath229 from @xmath280 .    although the above derivation of holographic ere is based on a number of assumptions it may be a plausible scenario .",
    "an explanation of ryu - takayanagi formula ( [ 1.1 ] ) seems to be its particular case which follows in the limit @xmath245 .",
    "this gives a further support to earlier arguments presented in @xcite and allows one to avoid their criticism in @xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to understand the behaviour of ere in a strong coupling regime .",
    "our approach to the holographic description of ere should hold in this case but functions @xmath281 , @xmath282 , @xmath283 in ( [ 7.21 ] ) may be different .",
    "the reason is that the logarithmic terms in the renyi entropy for @xmath284 are not determined solely by the conformal anomaly .",
    "they are not protected from both perturbative and non - perturbative corrections , as was pointed out in @xcite .",
