    "many interesting non - equilibrium physical phenomena ( shock wave dynamics , boundary driven phase transitions , etc . ) can be observed already in simplest models such as driven diffusing particle systems , recent review of which can be found e.g. in @xcite .",
    "these systems have a unique ability to feel the dynamics of the boundaries thanks to the presence of a flux of particles which brings information from boundaries to the bulk . in absence of a flux , indeed , boundaries would play marginal role , as in ordinary equilibrium statistical mechanics , but in presence of a flux the boundaries may dominate the bulk with the possibility to give rise to boundary driven phase transitions .",
    "these phenomena were indeed observed in one - species driven diffusive models @xcite and in some models containing more than one species of particles ( many - species models ) @xcite . in a more general context , the problem was addressed in @xcite , where it was shown that the stationary state of systems with one species of particles with open boundaries in non - equilibrium depends only on the stationary flux .",
    "this implies that an extremum principle for the stationary flux can be formulated @xcite and the properties of the stationary state can be obtained directly from the hydrodynamic limit . in this approach",
    "the stochastic model is mapped into a viscousless conservation law equation which is ill - defined ( the corresponding cauchy problem admits multiple solutions ) . since the dynamics of stochastic system ( markov process ) is unique , the problem of regularization , i.e. how to single out the physical solution from a set of multiple solutions , arises .",
    "as is well known , this problem is resolved by adding a phenomenological small dissipative term ( of order @xmath0 ) to the conservation law equation and then taking the limit @xmath1 . for this purpose , a linear viscous term of the form",
    "@xmath0 @xmath2 is usually considered , although nonlinear terms of the type @xmath0 @xmath3 @xmath2 , with @xmath3 being an arbitrary convex function , are also possible . for one - species systems",
    "this regularization procedure is quite robust in the sense that different choices of the viscosity term can be shown to lead to the same physical solution . for many - species models , however , this is not trivial . in this case",
    "the hydrodynamic limit is is described by a system of conservation laws ( one for each particle species ) and the regularization is usually achieved by adding a diagonal diffusion matrix of the form @xmath0 @xmath4 , to the system . in spite of its simplicity , there is no evidence that this approach works also for these more complicated systems and the regularization problem of multi - species driven diffusive systems is still open .",
    "the aim of the present letter is two - fold .",
    "from one side , we introduce a new class of multi - species driven diffusive models which generalize the single chain asymmetric exclusion process ( asep ) .",
    "these models possess nice properties such as product measure stationary state and particle - hole symmetry . from a physical point view",
    ", they describe the motion of particles in multi - channel cables with the particles in adjacent cables creating an effective barrier potential for the particles in a given cable to flow . from the other side , we study the hydrodynamic limit of these models by showing that the conventional regularization of the conservation law equations leads to wrong hydrodynamic results .",
    "general arguments which support this failure will be provided . on the contrary , we show that an alternative regularization , obtained directly from the microscopic dynamics , leads to correct results .",
    "a detailed comparison of the hydrodynamic predictions ( both with conventional and alternative regularization ) with direct monte carlo simulation of the original stochastic model confirms these results .",
    "although the mapping from _ hydrodynamic equations _ to _  stochastic processes _ is not unique , it is likely that our alternative regularization may work also for other multi - species driven diffusive models .",
    "to introduce the model , we consider @xmath5 discrete chains on which particles can hop preferentially in one direction .",
    "the hopping between adjacent chains is forbidden but particles can move from a site @xmath6 to an empty site @xmath7 on the same chain with rates that depend on the particle configuration at adjacent sites of `` neighboring '' @xmath8 chains ( the results will be qualitatively the same for other possibilities of next - neighboring hopping ) .",
    "notice that such a dynamics does not satisfy detailed balance condition meaning that the system is far from thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the hopping rates for different configurations can be expressed in terms of a single parameter @xmath9 measuring the strength of the interaction between the chains .",
    "let us denote with @xmath10 the hopping rate from site @xmath6 to site @xmath7 on the same chain , in presence of a total number @xmath11 of particles in adjacent chain sites .",
    "we restrict our search to the models having stationary product measures . in this case",
    ", calculation shows that the rates @xmath10 have to satisfy the condition @xmath12 for any @xmath11 . moreover",
    ", the rates @xmath10 turn out to depend only on @xmath11 and not on the particular configurations the @xmath11 particles can assume . with @xmath8 chains - neighbors , any given pair of consecutive sites @xmath13 can have from @xmath14 up to @xmath15 particles - neighbors .",
    "an example of the hopping process with the corresponding rates is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_16_rates ] for the case @xmath16 . in general , for a chain having @xmath8 chains - neighbors @xcite , the rates of hopping ( normalized to @xmath17 ) can be parametrized as @xmath18 notice that for @xmath19 the rates become independent on @xmath11 ( i.e. the interchain interaction becomes zero ) and the system splits into @xmath20 parallel uncoupled totally asymmetric exclusion processes ( tasep ) @xcite . for @xmath21 , the rates ( [ rates ] ) monotonically decrease with number of particles - neighbors @xmath11 , i.e. the presence of adjacent particles creates an effective barrier potential which slows down the particle movement .    , with their rates .",
    "four out of @xmath22 possible configurations are shown .",
    "the rates ( [ rates ] ) depend only on the total number of particles in the neighboring four sites . ]",
    "the driven diffusive models described by ( [ rates ] ) possess the following properties . _",
    "i ) product measure .",
    "_ one can easily check that the model admits a stationary distribution in the class of product measures .",
    "this means that the stationary state of the model is spatially uncorrelated , both in the longitudinal and in the transverse direction .",
    "this property allows to obtain a simple analytic expression for the stationary flux ( see below ) .    _",
    "ii ) particle - hole symmetry .",
    "_ it is easy to check that an exchange of particles with holes plus the substitution @xmath23 leaves the model invariant .",
    "since parameter @xmath9 must be is in the range @xmath24 ( the rates in ( [ rates ] ) are nonnegative ) , the present property allows to further restrict @xmath9 to the range @xmath25 only . in the limit of the strongest interaction @xmath26",
    "the hopping of a particle in completely saturated environment becomes impossible @xmath27 .",
    "let us consider some specific examples .",
    "_ case @xmath28 .",
    "_ in this case there is one `` neighboring '' chain for each given chain .",
    "this can happen if there are only two chains ( @xmath29 ) or if in the model with @xmath20 consecutive chains , the hopping along one chain depends only on the state of the next chain .",
    "due to the property ( i ) , the stationary flux on a given chain for @xmath28 can be computed straightforwardly as @xmath30{cc}% j(\\rho,\\sigma ) & = \\rho(1-\\rho)(1+(\\beta-1)\\sigma ) \\end{array } \\label{fluxs1}%\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are average densities of particles on a given chain and on a chain `` neighboring '' to it , respectively .",

    "from a physical point of view the case @xmath41 corresponds to a coaxial cable with many fibers , on which particles move , each fiber having @xmath8 fibers - neighbors surrounding it .",
    "a real system is always finite , so that boundary conditions , where particles can enter or exit the system must be imposed . to model boundaries , we couple model ( [ rates ] ) with stationary particle reservoirs of densities @xmath44 on the left boundary of chain @xmath36 , from where particles can be injected , and of the densities @xmath45 on the right boundary of it , where they can be extracted .",
    "the rates of extraction and injection are obtained from the boundary densities and for specific cases were given in @xcite .",
    "to proceed further , we fix the total number of chains , @xmath20 , the number of chains - neighbors of a given chain @xmath8 , the right and left boundary densities @xmath46 and study bulk stationary densities that is , in the limit when time tends to infinity @xmath47 @xcite , as the interchain interaction varies from @xmath19 ( non interacting case ) to @xmath26 ( case of maximal interaction ) .",

    "an adequate regularization is obtained by averaging exact lattice continuity equations of the stochastic process @xmath63 for occupation number operators @xmath64 of any given chain , making the lattice constant infinitesimally small @xmath65 . for the case ( [ rates ] ) , the local flux operator @xmath66 between the sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 reads ( see @xcite for a derivation of ( [ flux_operator ] ) in the case @xmath57 ) : @xmath67 here @xmath68  @xmath69 are occupation number operators for a site @xmath6 of the chains neighboring to a given one .",

    "we obtain that , while the agreement between the monte carlo predictions and the numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ hydro ] ) is excellent , the comparison with the standard hydrodynamic limit gives rise to inconsistencies ( see discussion below ) both in the stationary regime and during relaxation towards stationarity .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig_piccolo_chain2 ] for system of two and in fig.[fig_piccolo_chain3 ] for three chains with @xmath28 . from these figures",
    "it is clear that the choice of the viscosity is indeed crucial to obtain correct results , since different choices will produce different answers .",

    "( [ hydro ] ) gives results which coincide , up to non - universal boundary layer and interface width , with monte carlo simulations also for other values of @xmath55 , and we believe this fact is valid in general",
    ".    the above analysis can be easily generalized to the case in which the hopping along the chains occurs in both directions . in this case the corresponding flux to the left is obtained from the one to the right by exchanging @xmath82 in ( [ fluxs ] ) with the term @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 denote the particle hopping rates on the @xmath36-th chain to the right and to the left in the empty environment ( the general conditions for a product measure state can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to discuss why a diagonal diffusion matrix leads to inconsistent results for multi - species systems . to this regard",
    ", we remark that one can formally obtain a diagonal diffusion matrix in taylor expansion of ( [ lattice_continuity_equation ] ) by adding to the flux ( [ flux_operator ] ) an additional term as , e.g.@xmath86 if one substitutes the above expression into ( [ lattice_continuity_equation ] ) and performs the same analysis as before , one obtains the resulting equation in the form ( [ cons2 ] ) . in this case",
    ", however , the factorization becomes invalid because the flux operator ( [ naive ] ) describes different process with correlations in the stationary state and therefore with a stationary flux different from ( [ fluxs ] ) .",
    "thus , by making the diffusion matrix diagonal one expects inconsistencies .",
    "this can be seen by considering a microscopic state with all but one chains completely filled with particles , the chain partially filled having an empty region separated by a completely filled one , @xmath87 ,  @xmath88 and @xmath89 ,  @xmath90 . according to the dynamic rules in fig.[fig_16_rates ] ,",

    "notice that although the choice of the second term in eq .",
    "( [ naive ] ) is not unique , the above arguments for inconsistency would still be valid in presence of alternative choices .",
    "these inconsistencies are clearly seen on fig.[fig_piccolo_chain2 ] , where a comparison between stationary densities of the two chain system ( @xmath92 obtained from monte carlo calculations and hydrodynamic equations ( [ cons2],[hydro ] ) is made , as a function of the interchain interaction @xmath93 .",
    "the naive description ( [ cons2 ] ) shows a phase transition at @xmath94 , while monte carlo and  ( [ hydro ] ) show no effect .",
    "the occurrence of a phase transition to high densities can be understood as follows . since the right boundary density of particles of chain",
    "@xmath95 is high ( @xmath96 , it becomes more and more difficult for the particles of chain @xmath97 to exit the chain with increasing interaction , so that `` traffic jam '' occurs at the exit , this leading to the phase transition .",
    "this effect is greatly overestimated by the naive hydrodynamic description ( [ cons2 ] ) ( in physical system the transition happens for higher left boundary density @xmath98 ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have introduced a class of models which generalize the asymmetric simple exclusion process for an arbitrary number of chains and with hopping rates given as a function of the local configuration in the neighboring chains ( [ rates ] ) describing the effective friction a particle encounters moving in a dense environment . for these models we derived the stationary flux , and modified the conventional choice of the viscosity term in the hydrodynamic limit ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) in order to get a good agreement with monte carlo simulations of the original stochastic process .",
    "although the problem of the hydrodynamic limit has been discussed on the specific example of the introduced models , the results are expected to be valid in general ( the advantage of using our model is only for computational convenience since the product measure property allows to obtain the bulk flux , boundary conditions , etc .",
