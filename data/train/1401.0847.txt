    "alpha centauri is a remarkable hierarchical triple star system , a little more than a parsec from the sun .",
    "the central binary consists of a solar - mass yellow dwarf ( g2  v : `` a '' ) and a slightly less massive orange dwarf ( k1  v : `` b '' ) , separated by about 20  au ; orbited at great distance ( @xmath4  au ) by a dim , low - mass red dwarf ( m6  v : `` c '' aka `` proxima , '' nearest star to the sun ) . given the closeness of @xmath1  cen , an age only slightly older than the sun , similar hk activity , and bracketing the sun in mass , ab are important solar analogs .",
    "characteristics of the system , and a history of its myriad observations , can be found in the comprehensive review by beech ( 2012 ) .",
    "the present report examines long - term changes in @xmath1  cen s coronal x - rays .",
    "this is a follow - on to a previous study of coronal activity of ab ( ayres 2009 ; where additional details specifically relevant to the present work can be found ) .",
    "interest in the activity cycle of especially b has heightened recently with the proposed discovery of a close - in hot earth - mass planet in orbit around the star ( dumusque et al .",
    "2012 ; but see also hatzes 2013 ) .",
    "the doppler - reflex measurements were obtained when b was at the peak of its current cycle , and the increased spottedness of the k dwarf was a key systematic effect the authors had to confront in isolating the subtle radial velocity signal .",
    "robrade , schmitt , & favata ( 2012 ) have described the x - ray history of the @xmath1  cen components through mid-2010 , as part of a larger study of coronal cycles of solar - like dwarfs , based on measurements exclusively from _ xmm - newton .",
    "_ unfortunately , the small  and closing  separation of ab ( 4.4@xmath5 at end of 2013 ) in the current arc of their 80  year orbit is challenging for @xmath6-resolution _ xmm - newton , _ and its european photon imaging camera ( epic ) has poor sensitivity for very soft coronal sources like @xmath1  cen a ( see ayres 2009 ) .",
    "the authors proposed a period of 89 years for the more cleanly observed ( x - ray brighter ) b component , and 1215 years for fainter , blended a. dewarf , datin , & guinan ( 2010 ) have investigated the long - term high - energy activity of specifically @xmath1  cen  b , incorporating additional tracers such as `` subcoronal '' ultraviolet fluxes .",
    "they proposed a cycle of 8.8@xmath20.4  yr . these estimates compare with ayres ( 2009 ) tentative nine year period for b , based on the aggregated x - ray measurements then available ( 2008 december ) , from _ rosat , xmm - newton , _ and _ chandra .",
    "_    the present work extends the _ chandra _ time line by five years , showing a definitive minimum , rise , peak , and turn down of the @xmath1  cen b x - rays . together with previous high states seen sequentially by _",
    "rosat _ and _ xmm - newton , _ the new peak implies a well - defined cycle of @xmath7  yr for b over the past two decades .",
    "further , the sun - like a component finally appears to be emerging from an extended coronal low state ( originally noted by robrade , schmitt , & favata [ 2005 ] , and somewhat ominously described by them as the `` darkening of the solar twin '' ) .",
    "_ chandra _ pointings on @xmath1  cen utilized the high - resolution camera ( hrc ) , either in direct imaging mode ( hrc - i ) ; or recording the zeroth - order spatial image , and 5175    soft x - ray spectrum , with the low - energy transmission grating spectrometer ( letgs ) and hrc - s camera ( `` letg0 '' for the zeroth - order image)0.7 times less sensitive than hrc - i for soft coronal sources , based on paired hrc - i and letgs pointings on @xmath1  cen in 2007 and 2011 . ] .",
    "thanks to _",
    "chandra s _ 1@xmath5 resolution , there is little or no cross - talk between the ab event clouds ( unlike _ xmm - newton _ for which the ab sources have been badly blended since 2005 ) .",
    "characteristics of the instrument and general circumstances of the observations have been summarized by ayres ( 2009 ) .",
    "table  1 catalogs the full complement of _ chandra _ hrc - i and letgs exposures to date .",
    "figure  1 is a schematic streak image of the hrc pointings , from the `` first - light '' letgs observation early in the _ chandra _ mission ( raassen et al .",
    "2003 ) to the most recent hrc - i exposure in 2013 december .",
    "the large proper motion of ab to the west dominates , but parallactic wobbles also can be seen , emphasized by the six - month cadence of the program and the large parallax ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the slower orbital dance of the pair also is evident : ab are drawing toward a close approach on the sky in 2016 , with a minimum apparent separation of only @xmath9 .",
    "hrc captures the hierarchical , and in some instances subtle , motions of the system with a typical residual displacement of only 0.5@xmath5 ( relative to the pourbaix et al .  [ 2002 ] ephemeris and luyten [ 1976 ] proper motion ) ; testament to the high accuracy of the _ chandra _ aspect reconstruction .",
    "there are several improvements in the current work over the earlier ayres ( 2009 ) study .",
    "first , an average x - ray flux was extracted from each hrc event list by filtering out periods of apparent flare activity .",
    "this is especially relevant to the more recent pointings on b , during the peak of its starspot cycle when flares are more common .",
    "second , the x - ray light curves were corrected for dead time effects .",
    "these were ignored in the previous study , and generally are not important ( the dead time fraction normally is @xmath10% ) . however , closer examination uncovered one instance where the dead time fraction was unusually high ( @xmath1150% ) for the entire observation ( obsid  6375 : causing a spurious @xmath12 dip in the earlier ayres [ 2009 ] time series ) ; a second which had a cluster of dead time spikes in the middle of the sequence ( obsid  10980 ) ; and a few other , albeit more minor , anomalies .",
    "third , as described in more detail later , it has been possible to use the letgs spectra of @xmath1  cen , and two other low- to moderate - activity coronal stars , to undertake a recalibration of the hrc - i energy conversion factors ( ecf ) , which translate count rates into energy fluxes in a specific bandpass .",
    "figure  2 ( modeled after fig .  4 of robrade et al .",
    "2012 ) concatenates all the _ chandra _ pointings , with 300  s binning for the hrc - i events and 2100  s for letg0 .",
    "counts were collected in a @xmath13 detect cell , centered on the source , corresponding to 95% encircled energy ( ee ) .",
    "an average background was determined in a @xmath14 annulus , as measured from the geometrical center of the binary in each epoch . in all cases",
    "the background , scaled to the tiny detect cell , was less than 1% of the ( fainter ) a signal .",
    "the pipeline dead time corrections ( 2.1  s cadence ) were averaged in the same way as the source counts , and divided into the binned light curves .",
    "these x - ray measurements have high precision , because many events are accumulated into the averages for each epoch ; but potentially low accuracy , because short - term coronal fluctuations  due to flares , rotational modulation of inhomogeneous surface structures , or active region emergence and decay  can add significant systematic bias when a long - term trend is measured only infrequently with snapshot observations .",
    "this fundamental sampling issue is addressed quantitatively later .    within each time series",
    ", a mean level was determined from the main body of the count rate ( cr ) distribution , ignoring any high - cr tail resulting from transitory flare activity .",
    "the light curves in fig .  2 indicate that b was experiencing heightened flare activity as it rose in x - ray luminosity between 20102013 , as noted by robrade et al .",
    "( 2012 ) ; whereas a only recently has begun to climb out of an extended x - ray minimum , still displaying few , if any , discernible coronal transients .",
    "the obvious b flares typically are relatively brief compared with the @xmath1110  ks exposures , allowing a clear reading of the `` non - flare '' level .",
    "the resulting flare - filtered crs of ab are listed in table  1 , together with x - ray luminosities taking into account the distance and activity - dependent ecfs described later .",
    "a new letgs spectrum of ab was taken in mid-2011 , when the secondary star was near the peak of its long - term coronal cycle . the 2011 exposure , and previous two letgs epochs ( late-1999 and mid-2007 ) , are illustrated schematically in figure  3 .",
    "the plus and minus arms of the spectrum were folded onto each other , and divided by the effective exposure time at each merged wavelength , taking into account the detector gaps . also displayed are two comparison stars from the _ chandra _ archive : low - activity procyon ( @xmath1  cmi ; hd61421 : f5  iv - v ; obsid s 10994 and 12042 ) and moderate - activity @xmath15  eridani ( hd22049 : k2  v ; obsid 1869 ) .",
    "( these comparison spectra were used in the recalibration of the hrc - i ecf described later . ) the 2007 ab spectrum was especially instructive . as noted by ayres et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , @xmath1  cen a lacked the normal high - energy features in the `` iron l - shell '' region ( 12 kev ) , but still had significant emissions longward of 30   .",
    "this offered an explanation why _ xmm - newton _ saw such a dramatic `` fainting '' of the solar twin : the epic cameras must use a thick blocking filter to suppress visible photon contamination from bright optical sources like @xmath1  cen , and the filter potentially could cut out more of the soft x - rays than anticipated .",
    "( _ chandra s _ hrc is a different design specifically immune to `` red leak '' and does not require a blocking filter or other extraordinary measures for bright stars . )",
    "the 2011 spectrum finds a still in a low state ( i.e. , mainly lacking the fe l - shell features ) , while b had brightened up significantly below 20    compared with 2007 , now rivaling @xmath15  eri ( in appearance , although lower in @xmath3 ) .",
    "the letgs spectra have value in two important ways .",
    "first , calibrated line fluxes can be modeled using the differential emission measure ( dem ) approach ( as described by ayres [ 2009 ] for the two earlier @xmath1  cen letgs exposures , and those of the comparison stars mentioned above ; and raassen et al .  [ 2003 ] for the first - light [ late-1999 ] letgs spectrum of @xmath1  cen ) .",
    "a dem model provides insight into the distribution of material with temperature in the stellar corona , which in turn is related to the global heating and cooling processes that shape the hot outer atmosphere .",
    "second , the detailed x - ray spectral distribution of an object plays a key role in establishing an appropriate ecf ( erg  @xmath16  count@xmath17 ) to translate an hrc - i count rate into an energy flux .",
    "the existence of an letgs spectrum , in effect , compensates for the lack of innate energy discrimination in the hrc detectors . to determine an ecf , an x - ray spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the object",
    "is required : either the observed letgs spectrum itself , or an sed calculated from a best - fit dem model .",
    "the first option is preferred , if there is sufficient signal - to - noise in the observed spectrum , because even the most comprehensive line emissivity tabulations ( e.g. , the astrophysical plasma emission database [ aped ] : smith et al . 2001 ) still are missing many of the numerous weaker features , and occasionally the underlying atomic physics data are found to be inaccurate for even the stronger species ( e.g. , beiersdorfer et al .",
    "( the most recent version of aped [ 2.0.2 : foster et al .",
    "2012 ] was utilized in the dem modeling that follows . )",
    "a related issue is that of instrument cross - calibration . the ecf calculation ( e.g. , eq .  5 of ayres 2009 ) is a ratio of integrals in which the sed appears in both numerator and denominator",
    "thus , the ecf is first - order independent of the absolute level of the sed , caring mainly about the relative spectral distribution .",
    "the absolute part of the ecf comes from the energy - dependent effective area curve of the instrument . nevertheless , if the letgs and hrc - i are properly calibrated , the integral of the resolved letgs flux densities over some reference energy band , say 0.22  kev , should equal the energy flux derived from a point - source hrc - i measurement fluxed with the corresponding ecf .",
    "this is an important issue here , because of the starkly different results obtained for @xmath1  cen a , in its low state , with hrc - i compared with the _ xmm  newton _ epic imagers .",
    "it is possible that the higher fluxes obtained by _ chandra _",
    "might result from an inaccurate low - energy calibration of hrc - i ( see robrade et al .",
    "2012 ) , as opposed to the ayres et al .",
    "( 2008 ) suggestion that the _ xmm  newton _ thick - filter transmission instead might be at fault .",
    "this issue was addressed by undertaking a recalibration of the letgs spectra , as processed through the custom software ( in idl ) utilized here .",
    "the approach is described in general terms by ayres ( 2009 ) and has the heritage of beuermann et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who promoted the value of hot white dwarfs , like hz43 , and the neutron star rxj1856.6 - 3754 ( hereafter rxj1856 ) , for calibrating the soft response of letgs ; and of pollock ( 2004 ) , who similarly advocated the value of power - law agn sources for establishing the higher energy behavior of x - ray grating instruments .    to carry out the updated calibration , all the available letgs pointings on hz43 , rxj1856 , and the blazars mrk421 and pks2155 - 304 , from y2000 to the present , were collected from the _ chandra _ archive , processed through the custom pipeline , and coadded ( multiple observations were available for all the objects ) .",
    "this yielded high - resolution distributions of count rates with wavelength for each object type .",
    "the measured count rate densities ( @xmath18 , in count s@xmath17 @xmath17 ) are related to the ( ideally well - known , independently determined ) true photon flux densities ( @xmath19 , in pht @xmath16 s@xmath17 @xmath17 ) by , @xmath20\\,\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath21 is a redistribution matrix that describes the scattering of photons into higher diffraction orders relative to the first order ; @xmath22 is the grating efficiency for first order ; and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the effective area curve for all the instrumental components other than the grating assembly itself .",
    "@xmath21 differs from the more familiar `` response matrix , '' which for a grating instrument would have a nearly pure diagonal structure , with weaker adjacent off - diagonals reflecting the broadening of an input @xmath25-function source according to the wavelength dependent spectral point response function of the instrument . here",
    ", the higher - order redistribution matrix also is diagonally dominant ( all diagonal elements are unity , since the redistribution coefficients are defined relative to first order ) , but contains far - off - diagonal elements fanning out from the origin ( @xmath26 ) and located according to integer divisors of the input wavelength , @xmath27 for order @xmath28 , and populated by the relative grating efficiencies , @xmath29 , reflecting the photons scattered into wavelength @xmath30 from shorter wavelengths in the higher orders .    the @xmath21 matrix was constructed using revised values of the grating efficiencies for orders 125 in the file `` letgd1996-11-01greffpr001n0007.fits '' available from the _ chandra _ calibration database .",
    "the fundamental wavelength scales ( 1200   ) were built with a constant step of 25  m , about three points per letgs spectral resolution element .",
    "a constant wavelength bin is crucial for the success of the matrix approach , because an unresolved emission line that subtends @xmath31   at wavelength @xmath30 in first order , also will occupy the same @xmath31 in any higher order @xmath28 , because the resolution of the higher order increases as @xmath28 , but so does the output wavelength , @xmath32 , thus @xmath31 remains constant .",
    "in fact , the innate letgs resolution in first order also increases in proportion to @xmath30 , thus instrumental - resolution emission features at their native first - order wavelengths are indistinguishable from any higher - order , also unresolved , features diffracted to those wavelengths .",
    "finally , given an independent measurement of the target x - ray absolute photon densities in the letgs range , the effective area curve can be deduced from the observed @xmath18 by dividing by the product @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "one can provide the @xmath34 spectrum at the nominal wavelength - dependent letgs resolution , to avoid having to introduce additional line - spread terms directly into @xmath35 ; but this is irrelevant for the calibrators used here , which all are smooth continuum sources .",
    "beuermann et al .  ( 2006 ) tabulated consensus seds for hz43 and rxj1856 .",
    "the authors also provided a model for the latter based on a dominant @xmath36  ev black - body plus a @xmath37  ev `` hot spot , '' absorbed by an interstellar column , @xmath38 @xmath16 .",
    "more recently , kaastra et al .",
    "( 2009 ) published model atmospheres for hz43 ; their `` model  2 '' agrees best with the beuermann et al .",
    "photon densities . finally , pollock ( 2004 ) listed photon power law indices ( describing the photon flux density in pht @xmath16 s@xmath17 kev@xmath17 ) and galactic columns for several blazars including mrk421 and pks2155 - 304 .",
    "the letgs blazar spectra utilized here were coadded over various x - ray luminosity states , but the assumption was made that the average spectrum still could be modeled by a single photon power law .",
    "having the two sets of blazar spectra provided an independent check .",
    "the strategy was to let hz43 define @xmath23 for @xmath39   ; use rxj1856 to extend @xmath23 down below 40   ; then scale the blazars , which cover @xmath40    well , to match rxj1856 in the interval of overlap .",
    "in essence , rxj1856 served as a transfer standard between the best understood spectrum  that of the hot white dwarf  and the well - characterized blazar power laws .",
    "in fact , rxj1856 matched the soft end of the hz43 @xmath23 very well , although a small adjustment of @xmath111% was applied to the rxj1856 curve based on the wavelengths in common with hz43 .",
    "in short , @xmath23 was stitched together over several different types of calibrators , but fundamentally tied to the white dwarf model fluxes .",
    "then , any arbitrary @xmath18 spectrum can be translated to absolute photon flux densities according to the solution of eq .",
    "1 for @xmath19 ( which includes a matrix multiplication of @xmath41 against the @xmath18 spectrum to , in effect , delete the higher order photons ) . the flux density , @xmath42 ( erg @xmath16 s@xmath17 @xmath17 ) , can be obtained trivially from @xmath19 by multiplying by the energy per photon , @xmath43 .    as part of the calibration process ,",
    "the systematic @xmath44% decline in hrc - s sensitivity over the _ chandra _",
    "mission was taken into account , as follows .",
    "there are 14 letgs spectra of hz43 , taken between early 2002 and early 2011 , which were used in the letgs calibration .",
    "once the full effective area curve was derived from the stitched - together calibrators , each of the individual hz43 spectra then was fluxed , and integrated in several 1530    bands covering the wavelength region 55155    where the s /",
    "n of the white dwarf is high .",
    "the bandpass fluxes displayed a systematic decline of @xmath45% yr@xmath17 , independent of wavelength , relative to the mean epoch of the calibration , 2004.8 ( where the letgs fluxes identically match the wd calibration model ) . a linear correction in time",
    "then was incorporated in the letgs fluxing procedure to remove the ( albeit small ) systematic error that otherwise would be present in the @xmath1  cen letgs series ( covering an 11  year span ) .",
    "figure  4 illustrates results of the radiometric calibration procedure for selected bright lines of @xmath1  cen ab from the three epochs of letgs spectra .",
    "because the longwavelength ends of the two more recent ab observations are partially blended ( e.g. , at @xmath30171 and @xmath30174 ) , the normal `` bow - tie '' extraction template was replaced with a one - sided bow , extending in the direction opposite to the other spectral stripe , and the extracted counts were adjusted for the reduction in collecting area . similarly ,",
    "the off - spectrum background was collected in a one - sided manner , again opposite to the other spectrum in the cross - dispersion direction .",
    "the bow - tie extraction template , itself , was determined from a super - coaddition of all the reference spectral images ( white dwarf , neutron star , and the blazars ) , each registered in the cross - dispersion direction by centroiding .",
    "the boundaries of the high - s / n super - coadd were traced such that at any wavelength , about 95% of the counts were collected .",
    "this is a compromise between maximizing the 1-d cross - dispersion `` encircled energy , '' while minimizing the background ( which depends linearly on the width of the extraction template , and becomes increasingly a factor at the longer wavelengths where the bow broadens significantly ) .",
    "table  2 lists fluxes of representative letgs lines that were incorporated in the dem modeling described below .",
    "the letgs spectra divide , conveniently , into low and high states for both stars : epochs 2007 + 2011 for a - low , 1999 for a - high , 1999 + 2007 for b - low , and 2011 for b - high .",
    "the pairs of letgs spectra for the two sets of low states were averaged to improve s / n for those fainter epochs .",
    "the specific features in the table were selected on the basis of line strength , relative freedom from apparent blends in the observed spectra as well as in the emissivities , good coverage of coronal temperatures , and representing both low- and high - fip species .",
    "the formation temperature listed represent a weighting by both the emissivities and the dem model(s ) , so can differ significantly from the peak emissivity temperature ( noted in fig .",
    "4 ) if , for example , the dem is sharply peaked at a lower or higher temperature .",
    "the features , themselves , were measured in the fluxed letgs spectra using a gaussian fitting procedure , or  in cases where a feature was weak or absent  numerical integration over the effective width of an instrumental - resolution feature .",
    "three - sigma upper limits were assigned if the measured flux did not achieve that significance .    despite the updated letgs calibration effort ,",
    "the new x - ray line fluxes generally are in good agreement with the comparable measurements reported in ayres ( 2009 ) , although somewhat higher ( up to @xmath1120% ) in several cases .",
    "table  2 also provides far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) fluxes , of li - like @xmath301548 , @xmath301238 , and @xmath301031 , for the low and high states of ab .",
    "the fuv resonance lines form between 13@xmath46  k. they serve as a lower boundary condition for the dem modeling , tying into the he - like and h - like cno features of the letgs region .",
    "the fuv fluxes were measured from archival _ hubble _ space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) e140m-1425 echellegrams of ab , particularly those taken since 2010 , which cover the high state of b and low state of a ; the a high state was captured by stis in 1999 .",
    "the b low state was inferred from earlier long term _",
    "iue _ measurements ( see , e.g. , ayres et al .",
    "the fluxes were based on archival _ fuse _ data , in some cases ( i.e. , activity states not represented by the available spectra ) scaling from the other , longer wavelength , fuv features .",
    "the exact values of the fuv fluxes are not crucial , however , since they serve mainly as a distant boundary condition for the dem modeling , as described next .",
    "the final step , as a prelude to evaluating the time history of the @xmath1  cen x - ray fluxes , was to derive ecfs for the range of hrc - i count rates recorded from the two stars .",
    "a common way to derive the conversion factors is to utilize a synthetic spectrum , simulated either from an isothermal model or ",
    "better yet  from an emission measure distribution constructed to match , say , letgs line fluxes .",
    "a dem model has value in its own right , for the insight it can provide on the structure of the stellar corona , so the second approach was followed here .",
    "the modeling approach has been described in detail by ayres ( 2009 ) .",
    "the present version has been updated for the new selection of reference x - ray features , and the availability of an improved set of line emissivities ( aped2.0.2 ) .",
    "figure  5 summarizes the results of the dem modeling exercise . observed and simulated fluxes were normalized both by the bolometric flux of each star , @xmath47 , to remove the bias of the different stellar sizes , and by the @xmath48-integrated radiative power curve , @xmath49 , of the particular feature to allow the disparate species , which cover a wide range of intrinsic emissivities , to be compared on a more - or - less common scale ( see ayres 2009 ) .",
    "initially , a full spectrum at letgs resolution was created at each aped temperature step , by summing up all the line emissivities , treated as gaussian profiles of the appropriate resolution centered at the respective line wavelengths .",
    "then , the temperature - resolved spectra were individually integrated over the same wavelength band as the observed spectra for each specific target feature ( e.g. , @xmath501fwhm for a gaussian fit , or the wavelength bandpass for a numerically integrated measurement ) .",
    "these temperature - resolved , species - dependent power curves were the fundamental atomic - physics input to the dem modeling .",
    "calculated fits to the observed fluxes in fig .",
    "5 are separated according to high - fip and low - fip . in all cases a low - fip abundance enhancement of 2 was applied ( see ayres [ 2009 ] ) .",
    "the high - fip species for each star and activity state are closely reproduced by the illustrated dem distributions , and the low - fip species fall into place as well , given the uniform abundance enhancement .",
    "the new models are qualitatively similar to those derived in the previous study .",
    "they all show a characteristic deep minimum at temperatures just below @xmath51  k ; with coronal peaks at around @xmath526.16.3  k ; but display progressively more material at hotter temperatures moving up the ladder from a - low to b - high ; rather than , say , simply an increase in the peak-@xmath53 dem with increasing activity .",
    "the a low state perhaps could be interpreted as a `` basal '' corona lacking any magnetic active regions ( i.e. , starspots and surrounding `` plage '' ) , as is characteristic of the sun during one of its decadal spot minima .",
    "the a high state ( and both b states ) might then represent the situation of adding active regions to the basal circumstance : on the sun , sunspot groups have notably higher coronal temperatures , 23  mk , than the @xmath111  mk quiet corona .",
    "the emission of the fuv `` transition zone '' species also rises with increasing activity ( a - low to b - high ) , but more slowly than the coronal ( @xmath54  mk ) counterparts .",
    "this is a well - known activity trend ( e.g. , ayres et al .",
    "1995 ) , and undoubtedly also is tied to an increasing prevalence of active regions .      finally , the pieces are available to solve the ecf puzzle .",
    "an hrc - i ecf can be calculated for each activity - specific state of ab , which applies to one or more of the individual letgs spectra ( e.g. , there are two a - low and two b - low cases ) , by dividing the integrated spectral flux , say 6.262    ( corresponding to the familiar 0.22  kev `` _ rosat _ '' band ) , by a convolution of the hrc - i effective area with the photon spectrum , integrated over all wavelengths for which @xmath23 is non negligible .",
    "( the formalism applies specifically to a sensor , like hrc , lacking any energy discrimination . )",
    "the trick is to find an appropriate reference sed .",
    "this is a challenge because a dem - motivated aped model is not a perfect representation of the intrinsic stellar x - ray spectrum , owing to missing lines and/or incomplete atomic physics ; but , an letgs spectrum also is not a perfect representation of the intrinsic stellar sed , because unavoidable photon noise can masquerade as real signal , or noise can mask true spectral structure , such as a weak but ubiquitous bremsstrahlung continuum .",
    "in fact , it could be important to consider wavelengths beyond the nominal limits of an letgs spectrum ( 5175   , for the custom extractions here ) , depending on how far to longer , or shorter , wavelengths the hrc - i effective area extends . the tabulation provided by",
    "the caldb starts at 1.1   , and ends at 200   , where the area is about 0.5% of the peak and dropping toward longer wavelengths , but not precipitously .",
    "an aped spectrum for a 1  mk soft source , like @xmath1  cen a , has significant coronal emission beyond 200   , and interstellar absorption is not much of a help in attenuating the longer wavelengths for these very nearby stars .",
    "nevertheless , in the absence of additional information , the hrc - i effective area was assumed to vanish beyond 200   .",
    "experiments showed that extrapolating @xmath23 out to 250   , based on the apparent slope below 200   , caused about a 3% decrease in the ab ecfs ; a small uncertainty , to be sure , in the overall scheme .",
    "recall that the hrc - i ecf depends mostly on the shape of the coronal sed , rather than its absolute level .",
    "thus , it is essential to empirically validate the cross - calibration of hrc - i relative to letgs .",
    "this requires finding pairs of letgs and hrc - i pointings on soft coronal targets taken close enough in time that variability issues are minimized .",
    "unsurprisingly , a search of the _ chandra _ archive revealed very few suitable pairs . it would be unusual to take an hrc - i exposure of a target bright enough to record an letgs spectrum , unless it were for calibration purposes : letgs not only provides diagnostically valuable energy resolution , but also spatial information through the zeroth - order image ; rendering a companion hrc - i pointing , well , pointless .",
    "thankfully , however , the two recent letgs spectra of @xmath1  cen were paired with hrc - i exposures relatively close in time ( obsids 7432 + 7433 , @xmath55  d ; 12332 + 12333 , @xmath56  d ) ; potentially suitable material for the cross - calibration piece of the ecf .",
    "furthermore , there is a single hrc - i exposure of the presumably very constant neutron star rxj1856 ( actually several pointings , but only one  obsid 4288  was taken on - axis with the target in focus ) , to match against the collection of letgs spectra used in the recalibration exercise .",
    "rxj1856 is especially important for the cross - calibration validation , because its black - body spectrum covers the key range 2070   , closely corresponding to the soft end of the 0.22  kev band , and matching the peak of the @xmath1  cen a low state spectrum .",
    "because the neutron star thermal emission falls almost exclusively within that relatively confined wavelength interval , there is no issue with out - of - band flux .",
    "the hrc - i ecf calculated for rxj1856  based on the theoretical model , which was normalized to the observed average letgs flux distribution , and matches it very well  is 6.5 ( in units of @xmath57 erg @xmath16 count@xmath17 ) , compared with the `` neutral '' value 7.3 ( in same units ) for a constant source spectrum between 6.262    and zero flux elsewhere . because the hrc - i @xmath23 is itself relatively flat between 570  ",
    ", the ecf responds mainly to the mean energy of the source photons . for a spectrum tilted toward higher energies , like the blazers",
    ", the ecf will increase from the neutral value , whereas for a source sloping toward lower energies , like rxj1856 , the ecf will be lower .",
    "these considerations also are affected by out - of - band flux , such as for the low - activity stars discussed here , because significant counts can be collected outside the reference band , particularly 65200    for soft aped - like sources , thus causing the bandpass flux to be ` diluted , ' implying a lower ecf ( the ecfs for the @xmath1  cen stars are @xmath58 , as shown later ) .",
    "given the ecf calculated for rxj1856 , and the integrated flux in the reference band derived from the empirically normalized model , the predicted hrc - i count rate ( @xmath59 ) is 1.70  cps .",
    "the observed cr is 1.82  cps , measured from obsid  4288 ( 1.6@xmath5 detect cell , accounting for 95% ee factor ) , implying that the theoretical ecf is too large by @xmath60% .",
    "that , in turn , would suggest that the hrc - i @xmath23 is understated ( on average , in the 0.22  kev band ) by the same amount .",
    "this compares with the 6% uncertainty in the hrc - i quantum efficiency at low energies cited in the _ chandra _ caldb documentation .",
    "turning back to the more normal stellar coronal sources , there are legitimate concerns , as alluded earlier , over choosing for the reference sed a purely theoretical aped spectral model versus a purely empirical , observed letgs spectrum . to balance these concerns ,",
    "a hybrid approach was taken .",
    "first , a best - fit dem was developed for each of the target examples ( low and high states of ab , and including the coadded letgs spectrum of soft source procyon and the single letgs exposure of more active @xmath15  eri ) .",
    "then , the resulting aped spectral distribution was normalized to the observed letgs tracing over the range 6.262   considering only those wavelengths for which the observed flux densities exceeded 2@xmath61 with respect to the assigned photometric errors .",
    "finally , the portions of the full letgs spectrum that survived the 2@xmath61-cut were spliced into the normalized model sed . in this way ,",
    "all the brightest lines of the empirical spectrum were preserved , even those that might not be well reproduced by the aped simulation ; but the low flux , noisy regions of the empirical spectrum were replaced by the ( noiseless ) theoretical fluxes , including the faint but ubiquitous bremsstrahlung continuum and those weaker lines captured by aped ( although certainly not a complete set of those features ) .    taking the aped simulation shortward of the lower effective limit of the letgs , @xmath115    for these soft sources , and beyond the instrumental upper limit , @xmath11175   , out to the 200    cutoff of @xmath23 , accounted for the possible influence of those `` missing '' parts of the soft x - ray spectrum .",
    "ism attenuation of the dem - derived spectrum was included , with @xmath62 ( in units of @xmath63 @xmath16 ) for @xmath1  cen ab ; 0.8 for procyon ; and 0.6 for @xmath15  eri ( redfield & linsky 2008 ) .",
    "the 2@xmath61 cut is a balance between wanting to include as much of the empirical spectrum as possible , while minimizing wavelengths that might be compromised by spurious fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless , ecfs calculated with cuts at 1.5@xmath61 or 2.5@xmath61 differed from the 2@xmath61 result by less than 3% in all cases .",
    "however , the hybrid spectrum ecfs were systematically @xmath1110% lower than predicted by the purely dem - derived aped seds for the @xmath1  cen stars , although nearly identical for procyon and @xmath15  eri .",
    "next , the hybrid ecfs were compared against an activity index , defined as the predicted hrc - i count rate ( i.e. , the denominator of the ecf ratio ) divided by the bolometric flux of the star ( 2.87 for a , 0.96 for b , 1.82 for procyon , and 0.105 for @xmath15  eri [ native units are @xmath64 erg @xmath16 s@xmath17 ] ) .",
    "the ecfs displayed a systematic trend with the reduced count rate , @xmath66 , characterized by a power law index of 0.16 .",
    "then , `` empirical '' ecfs ( i.e. , dividing the bandpass integrated 2@xmath61-cut hybrid flux by an hrc - i cr from a pointing close in time to the letgs exposure ) were constructed for the two pairs of @xmath1  cen spectra .",
    "compared to the derived power law , the empirical ecfs fell below by 6@xmath23% ( uncertainty is a standard error of the mean : three of the values were consistently @xmath44% low , the other , a few percent high ) , similar to rxj1856 . recall that the theoretical / empirical validation of the ecfs relies on source constancy between the letgs and hrc - i pointings ; certainly a good assumption for rxj1856 , but less so for the @xmath1  cen stars .",
    "since the majority of the four ab offsets , and their average , agree with the more reliable 7% deficit indicated by rxj1856 , the constant coefficient in the initial power law was reduced by 7% yielding a consensus conversion factor , @xmath67 in the units mentioned earlier .",
    "compared with the earlier _ chandra _ study , these ecfs are systematically 2030% smaller for the various activity states of @xmath1  cen",
    ". the empirical validation increases confidence that the letgs and hrc - i fluxes now are consistent , and ultimately traceable back to the fundamental calibration of hz43 .",
    "the new ecf subsequently was applied to the hrc - i measurements of ab .    in the chain of argument that led to this result ,",
    "essentially all of the uncertainties are of the systematic type , because random errors due to photon statistics are negligible owing to the high quality exposures of the original calibrators , as well as of @xmath1  cen ab and the other comparison coronal stars .",
    "an example of a potential systematic error was the decision to adopt the small offset between theoretical and empirical ecfs indicated by the calibration target rxj1856 , and supported by three of the @xmath1  cen letgs / hrc - i pairs ( but not the fourth ) .",
    "the potential size of this systematic error could be as large as the 7% adopted for the offset .",
    "there are additional possible systematic errors , especially those associated with the letgs calibration and the choice of the `` 2@xmath61-cut '' hybrid spectrum approach , which could contribute comparable levels of uncertainty .",
    "if the systematics combine incoherently , the cumulative systematic error could be less than @xmath1115% ; but if the systematics reinforce each other , the total uncertainty could be larger .",
    "figure  6 summarizes the time history of the @xmath1  cen coronal emissions , including the previous _ rosat _ era ( in two cases  1996.13 and 1996.64  averaged over month - long campaigns with 12 day sampling ) ; all the _ chandra _ measurements ( hrc - i flare - filtered averages and letgs integrated fluxes ) ; and the _ xmm - newton _",
    "s published by the hamburg group ( robrade et al .",
    "a factor of 1.28 was applied to the latter to match the apparent _ chandra _ cycle of b , reflecting an  albeit small  lingering disagreement between the ecf s of the thick - filtered epic cameras compared to hrc . to be sure",
    ", the discrepancy is smaller than proposed in the earlier ayres ( 2009 ) study ( which was more like a factor of 2 ) , at least for @xmath1  cen b ; and comparable to the potential systematic errors described above .",
    "this certainly is a positive outcome for the updated letgs / hrc - i cross - calibration .",
    "note , however , that even with the scaling to match b , the _ xmm - newton _",
    "s for a , between 20052010 , still fall significantly below the _ chandra _ values , perhaps adding weight to the earlier suggestion that the _ xmm - newton _ thick - filter calibration might be an issue for very soft sources , like a s low state .",
    "the upper panel of the figure reports solar 0.22  kev x - ray luminosities over the past two decades obtained from the flare irradiance spectral model ( fism ) tabulations , daily values integrated over the 6.262    reference bandpass and averaged in 81-day bins ( 3 solar rotations ) .",
    "error bars are standard deviations within each time bin and illustrate the average amplitude of variability associated with rotational modulations and active region evolution ; solar flares are too modest , too short in duration , and too infrequent to significantly affect these @xmath61 s .",
    "a long - term average over the preceding three solar cycles is presented as well ( see ayres [ 2009 ] for details ) .    the depression of the _ xmm - newton _ a coronal luminosities relative to _ chandra _ perhaps can be likened to the dramatic contrast between _ yohkoh _ x - ray images of the sun at cycle minimum ( uniformly dark disk , only a few scattered bright points ) compared with softer imagers like the _ soho_/eit 195    channel ( ` fuzzy green ball : ' substantial , ubiquitous coronal emission still present at minimum )",
    "nevertheless , all the instruments , stellar and solar , should be able to report consistent fluxes for any specified reference band within their sensitivity range , if calibrated properly .",
    "it is worth recalling that the _ chandra _ hrc microchannel - plate sensors were specifically designed to have excellent soft response , if only because at least hrc - s must record the letgs spectrum with good sensitivity out to 175    ( well beyond the @xmath1135    limit of the reflection grating spectrometer on _ xmm - newton _ ) . at the same time",
    ", one must be somewhat wary of a non - energy - resolving detector , like hrc , that can collect significant counts from out - of - band photons ( i.e. , outside the 0.22  kev reference interval ) , because , for example , dominant flux from the apparently less volatile coronal emissions beyond @xmath68    could mask a sudden drop in intensity at the shorter , already intrinsically fainter wavelengths .",
    "that is where the letgs spectra have provided an essential grounding point , to show explicitly how the @xmath1  cen seds evolve from the a low state to the b high state .",
    "also illustrated in fig .",
    "6 are sinusoidal fits in @xmath69 to the ab x - ray light curves , including for b  but not a  the scaled _ xmm - newton _ values .",
    "as seen in the upper panel , the solar cycle shape is only roughly log - sinusoidal . despite that , the simple model provides a good match to the b x - ray time series , with apparent peaks in 199596 in the _ rosat _ era , _ xmm - newton _ circa 2004 , and now _ chandra _ in 2012 .",
    "the resulting period is @xmath7  yr , somewhat smaller than the earlier estimates .",
    "( the period uncertainty was estimated by a monte carlo approach , exploiting the empirical `` snapshot variability '' described below . )",
    "the x - ray minimum - to - peak contrast is about 4.5 , roughly half the typical solar amplitude , although b is several times more active than the sun in @xmath3 . b s cycle is reminiscent of the k5  v star 61  cygni a ( [ hd201091 ] p@xmath117  yr ; contrast@xmath113 : robrade et al .",
    "2012 ) .    as for @xmath1  cen a , only a single peak",
    "possibly has been seen ( 19982000 ) .",
    "the long interval of low , nearly constant @xmath12 might indicate a lack of cycling , as in a maunder minimum ; or a delayed rise , like that experienced by the sun transitioning to contemporary cycle  24 . blindly applying the log - sinusoidal model suggests a period of @xmath70  yr , about 70% longer than solar normal .",
    "the minimum - to - peak contrast is smaller than b s , about 3.4 .",
    "the solar twin does appear to be recovering in @xmath12 compared with 20052010 , so it remains to be seen whether it reestablishes a sun - like cycle , or continues in a more leisurely coronal holding pattern .",
    "the average deviation of the observed @xmath12 s with respect to the best - fit log - sinusoidal model is an empirical estimate of the snapshot variability . for the _ rosat _ plus _ chandra _ epochs , the deviation of the a luminosities from the best - fit model was about 10% , while for b , now including _ xmm - newton _ , it was about 22% .",
    "additionally , the standard deviation of the a luminosities over the two campaigns in 1996 , of nearly daily visits by _",
    "rosat , _ was @xmath1113% ; while for b , @xmath1119%",
    "the potential influence of these@xmath111020% short - term coronal fluctuations on the @xmath71% long - term trends thus appears to be minor , supporting the semiannual sampling used here with _",
    "chandra , _ and by the _ xmm - newton _ group in their broader survey .",
    "the @xmath1  centauri stars are quite sun - like in their fundamental stellar properties , and at least b displays a solar - like x - ray activity cycle , although with a somewhat shorter period ( a `` class 1 '' variable in the notation of the hk project : baliunas et al .",
    "in contrast , @xmath1  cen a has been behaving as if in a maunder minimum , or perhaps just has an over - long normal cycle ( `` class 3 '' variable ) . even at",
    "the minimum of a s contemporary variation ( or lack of same ) , its @xmath12 ( and @xmath3 ) still is similar to the sun s during the extended minimum at the conclusion of cycle  23 .",
    "this supports the conclusion of ayres et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and ayres ( 2009 ) that the `` fainting of the solar twin '' witnessed by _ xmm - newton _ perhaps is more related to calibration issues , than a true indication that a had fallen into an ultra - deep minimum , well below anything seen so far on the sun .",
    "if the latter were the case , it would suggest that the pure convectively driven surface dynamo of the star ( on the sun responsible for the ubiquitous quiet corona , outside of active regions , present even at sunspot minimum , and relatively constant over the cycle : e.g. , snchez almeida & martnez gonzlez [ 2011 ] , and references therein ) had at least partly failed .",
    "this certainly is a possibility , given our present incomplete knowledge concerning the inner workings of dynamo processes ; but also not a theoretical path that necessarily needs to be pursued , given _",
    "chandra s _ alternative , less catastrophic , view of the @xmath1  cen a fainting episode .    with regard to the putative earth - mass companion of @xmath1",
    "cen b , the next few years should find the k dwarf approaching a minimum of its x - ray cycle .",
    "the decreasing spottedness would mitigate one of the key systematic errors that affects the subtle doppler - reflex measurements . countering that advantage",
    ", ab will be passing through a mutual close approach on the sky , increasing scattered light contamination of b s visual spectrum by brighter a.    in short , both components of @xmath1  cen appear to be exhibiting symptoms of coronal variability seen historically on the sun through the lens of sunspot counts ( and on other stars through hk monitoring ) : regular cycles mixed with occasional extended minima featuring few if any spots .",
    "as such , @xmath1  cen ab  with the most detailed stellar x - ray histories to date",
    " will continue to serve as keystone examples of the coronal counterparts of starspot cycles , to balance against the more accessible , but generally more subtle , chromospheric hk records .",
