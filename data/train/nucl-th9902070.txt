    "in the last years , many efforts have been focussed on the study of high energy nuclear collisions , resulting in a better understanding of the strongly interacting matter at high energy density .",
    "large acceptance detectors provide a detailed analysis of the multiplicity of produced particles ; this in turn can be related to possible signatures of the formation of a new phase of matter , the so  called quark ",
    "gluon plasma ( qgp ) , in the early stages of high energy heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting experimental results is that high energy nucleus ",
    "nucleus ( a+a ) collisions can not be described in terms of superpositions of elementary nucleon ",
    "nucleon ( n+n ) interactions ( proton  proton or proton  antiproton ) .",
    "the different conditions of energy density and temperature at the early stage of the pb+pb and of the p+p collisions ( to mention just two extreme examples ) generate collective effects that modify the features of freeze  out observables .",
    "of course the most appealing explanation would be to interpret the presence of these evident experimental differences as an indirect consequence of the formation of qgp in the early stages of heavy ion collisions .",
    "it is an experimentally established fact @xcite that the slope parameter of the transverse momentum distribution significantly increases with the particle mass when going from p+p to central pb+pb collisions . on the other hand ,",
    "the preliminary results of the na49 collaboration @xcite indicate that the transverse momentum fluctuations in central pb+pb collisions at 158 a gev have a quite different physical origin with respect to the corresponding fluctuations in p+p collisions .",
    "let us also recall that the observed @xmath0 suppression increases continuously and monotonically from the lightest ( p+p ) to the heaviest ( s+u ) interacting nuclei , but it exhibits a clear departure from this `` normal '' behavior for central pb+pb collisions @xcite .",
    "these experimental features have been explained in terms of collective effects in the hadronic medium ( such as the presence of a transverse hydrodynamical expansion ) and considering the strong influence of secondary rescatterings in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "it is a very important issue to understand whether the system is able to reach full thermalization ; up to now this question has been the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "however several experimental observables , such as transverse mass spectrum , multiplicity of particles , three  dimensional phase  space density of pions , are well reproduced in the framework of local thermal equilibrium in a hydrodynamical expanding environment @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we start from the hypothesis that memory effects and long  range forces can occur during high energy heavy ion collisions : in this case the strong influence of collective effects on the experimental observables can be understood in a very natural way in the framework of the generalized nonextensive thermostatistics . in this context",
    "we show that the transverse momentum correlations of the pions emitted from central pb+pb collisions can be very well reproduced by means of very small deviations from the standard equilibrium extensive statistics .    in sec.[kin_sec ]",
    "we summarize the main assumptions contained in the derivation of the dynamical kinetical equations and their relevance to the determination of the equilibrium phase  space distribution . in sec.[qcd_sec ] we examine whether these conditions are met in the high energy heavy ion collisions and which experimental observables can be sensitive to the presence of nonextensive statistical effects . in sec.[tsa_sec ] we introduce the nonextensive tsallis thermostatistics which is considered the natural generalization of the standard classical and quantum statistics when memory effects and/or long range forces are not negligible . in sec.[ptm_sec ] we show how the generalized distribution function modifies the shape of the transverse mass spectrum and in sec.[phi_sec ] we investigate the influence of nonextensive particle fluctuations in the determination of the measure of the transverse momentum correlations .",
    "finally , a discussion of the results and some conclusions are reported in sec.[conclu_sec ] .",
    "assuming local thermal equilibrium , the freeze  out observables are usually calculated within the extensive thermostatistics . in particular , the equilibrium transverse momentum distribution is assumed to be , in the classical case , the standard maxwell  boltzmann ( jttern ) distribution .",
    "if the emitted particles are light enough , such as pions , to have noticeable quantum degeneracy , one must use the bose ",
    "einstein ( or fermi  dirac , for fermions ) distribution .",
    "when the system approaches equilibrium , the phase  space distribution should be derived as a stationary state of the dynamical kinetical evolution equation .",
    "if , for sake of simplicity , we limit our discussion to the classical case , the maxwellian distribution is obtained as a steady state solution of the boltzmann equation .",
    "let us now briefly review the principal assumptions in the derivation of the boltzmann equation and examine how these approximations can affect the determination of the equilibrium distribution @xcite .",
    "one important assumption concerns the collision time , which must be much smaller than the mean time between collisions .",
    "this request can be expressed by the condition @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the density and @xmath3 is the effective range of the interactions .",
    "this condition has two important physical consequences .",
    "a ) there is no overlapping between subsequent collisions involving a given particle and the interactions can be described as a succession of simple binary collisions .",
    "b ) it is always possible to define a time interval in which the single particle distribution does not change appreciably and its rate of change at time @xmath4 depends only on its instantaneous value and not on its previous history .",
    "hence this property reflects the markovian character of the boltzmann equation : no memory is taken into account .",
    "the second assumption is analoguous to the first one , but for the space dependence of the distribution function : its rate of change at a spatial point depends only on the neighborhood of that point . in other words",
    "the range of the interactions is short with respect to the characteristic spatial dimension of the system .",
    "the last important assumption is the so  called bolzmann s stosszahlansatz : the momenta of two particles at the same spatial point are not correlated and the corresponding two body correlation function can be factorized as a product of two single particle distributions .",
    "this assumption is very important because it allows us to write down the collisional integral ( which is equal to the total time rate of change of the distribution function ) in terms of the single particle distribution only .",
    "the above assumptions , namely the absence of non  markovian memory effects , the absence of long  range interactions and negligible local correlations , together with the boltzmann s h theorem ( based on the _ extensive _ definition of the entropy ) lead us to the well  known stationary maxwellian distribution .",
    "the basic assumption of standard statistical mechanics is that the system under consideration can be subdivided into a set of non  overlapping subsystems . as a consequence the boltzmann ",
    "gibbs entropy is extensive in the sense that the total entropy of two independent subsystems is the sum of their entropies .",
    "if memory effects and long range forces are present , this property is no longer valid and the entropy , which is a measure of the information about the particle distribution in the states available to the system , is not an extensive quantity .    in the next section , we will see whether the above assumptions are implemented during high energy nuclear collisions and if there appear experimental signals that can be interpreted as a consequence of the presence of a nonextensive regime .",
    "it is a rather common opinion that , because of the extreme conditions of density and temperature in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions , memory effects and long  range color interactions give rise to the presence of non ",
    "markovian processes in the kinetic equation affecting the thermalization process toward equilibrium as well as the standard equilibrium distribution @xcite .",
    "a rigorous determination of the conditions that produce a nonextensive behavior , due to memory effects and/or long  range interactions , should be based on microscopic calculations relative to the parton plasma originated during the high energy collisions . at this stage",
    "we limit ourselves to consider the problem from a qualitative point of view on the basis of the existing theoretical calculations and experimental evidences .    under the hypothesis that qgp",
    "is generated in the high energy collisions , the quantities characterizing the plasma , such as lifetime and damping rates of quasiparticles , are usually calculated within finite temperature perturbative qcd . this approach is warranted by the fact that at high temperature ( beyond a few hundred mev ) the strong qcd coupling @xmath5 becomes very small and `` weak coupling '' regime takes place . in this regime ( @xmath6 ) the longitudinal gluon propagator is characterized by a debye mass @xmath7 , and the corresponding screening length ( @xmath8 ) is much larger than the mean interparticle distance ( @xmath9 ) ( for a review , see e.g. , ref.@xcite ) . therefore a great parton number is contained in the debye sphere and the ordinary mean field approximation of qgp ( debye  hckel theory ) holds .",
    "nevertheless , in the proximity of the phase transition , the qgp is no longer a system of weakly interacting particles and non  perturbative qcd calculations become important .",
    "recently it has been shown @xcite that for temperature near the critical one ( @xmath10 ) non  perturbative calculations imply an effective quark mass very close to @xmath11 , sensibly different from the value , proportional to @xmath12 , obtained in perturbative regime . near the phase transition",
    "the characteristic quantity @xmath13 should then be very close to one and only a small number of partons is present in the debye sphere : the ordinary mean field approximation of the plasma is no longer correct and memory effects are not negligible . in addition , we observe that in high density quark matter the color magnetic field remains unscreened ( in leading order ) and long  range color magnetic interaction should be present at all temperatures .    from the above considerations it appears reasonable",
    "that , if the deconfining phase transition takes place , non  markovian effects and long range interactions can influence the dynamical evolution of the generated fireball toward the freeze  out stage",
    ". moreover they will affect the equilibrium phase ",
    "space distribution function if thermal equilibrium is attained .",
    "a signature of these effects should show up in physical observables . in this context",
    ", we notice that the authors of ref.@xcite raise a controversy on the markovian description of the multiple scattering processes , one of the assumptions of the urqmd model .",
    "this example concerns ( @xmath14 ) scattering , where a determination of the angular distribution based on the markovian approximation of the transport theory leads to wrong results @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to suggest a possible interpretation of the above mentioned difference between the correlactions / fluctuations of the pion transverse momentum measured in p+p and pb+pb collisions @xcite as a signature of the nonextensivity of the system .",
    "in fact , it has been shown @xcite that , whether the equilibrium condition is realized or not , the measure of the correlations / fluctuations strongly depends on the factorization of the multiparticle distributions and on the event by event multiplicity of the particles under consideration .",
    "such property implies that the ( multi)particle distribution functions are not inclusive ( the distribution functions of one , two , or more bodies , depend on the presence of the other particles of the system ) . in turn , this is a manifestation of a nonextensive behavior of the system .    in addition",
    "we notice that , from a recent analysis of the average pion phase ",
    "space density at freeze  out in s  nucleus and pb  pb collisions at sps , the experimental data indicate a slower decrease with increasing @xmath15 than the bose  einstein curve @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the same quantity in @xmath16p collisions seems , instead , to be consistent with the standard expectations .",
    "we remind that in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors show that by assuming the standard jttern momentum distribution of emitted particles in high energy collisions one is led to unrealistic consequences and the physical freeze  out is actually not realized .    from the foregoing considerations we conclude that both theoretical calculations and experimental observables agree with the existence of nonextensive features in high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "several new developments in statistical mechanics have shown that in the presence of long  range forces and/or in irreversible processes related to microscopic long  time memory effects , the extensive thermodynamics , based on the conventional boltzmann ",
    "gibbs thermostatistics , is no longer correct and , consequently , the equilibrium particle distribution functions can show different shapes from the conventional well known distributions .",
    "standard sums , or integrals , which appear in the calculation of thermostatistical quantities , like the partition function , the entropy , the internal energy , etc . can diverge .",
    "these difficulties are well known in several physical domains @xcite since long time .    a quite interesting generalization of the conventional boltzmann ",
    "gibbs statistics has been recently proposed by tsallis @xcite and proves to be able to overcome the shortcomings of the conventional statistical mechanics in many physical problems , where the presence of long  range interactions , long  range microscopic memory , or fractal space  time constraints hinders the usual statistical assumptions .",
    "among other applications , we quote astrophysical self  gravitating systems @xcite , the solar neutrino problem @xcite , cosmology @xcite , many  body , dynamical linear response theory and variational methods @xcite , phase shift analyses for the pion ",
    "nucleus scattering @xcite .",
    "the tsallis generalized thermostatistics is based upon the following generalization of the entropy @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the probability of a given microstate among @xmath19 different ones and @xmath20 is a fixed real parameter .",
    "the new entropy has the usual properties of positivity , equiprobability , concavity and irreversibility , preserves the whole mathematical structure of thermodynamics ( legendre transformations ) and reduces to the conventional boltzmann ",
    "gibbs entropy @xmath21 in the limit @xmath22 .",
    "the deformation parameter @xmath20 measures the degree of nonextensivity of the theory .",
    "in fact , if we have two independent systems @xmath23 e @xmath24 , such that the probability of @xmath25 is factorized into @xmath26 , the global entropy is not simply the sum of their entropies but it is easy to verify that @xmath27    for a better appreciation of the meaning of nonextensivity in a physical system , we discuss here another important property . let us suppose that the set of @xmath19 microstates is arbitrarily separated into two subsets having @xmath28 and @xmath29 microstates ( @xmath30 ) , respectively , and define as @xmath31 and @xmath32 the corresponding probabilities : hence @xmath33 .",
    "it is then easy to show that @xmath34 where the sets @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the conditional probabilities .",
    "this is a generalization of the famous shannon s property but for the appearance of @xmath37 and @xmath38 instead of @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the second and third terms of the right hand side of ( [ shann ] ) . since the probabilities @xmath41 are normalized , @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 : as a consequence values of @xmath43 ( @xmath45 ) will favour rare ( frequent ) events , respectively .",
    "the single particle distribution function is obtained through the usual procedure of maximizing the tsallis entropy under the constraints of keeping constant the average internal energy and the average number of particles . for a dilute gas of particles and/or for @xmath46 values",
    ", the average occupational number can be written in a simple analytical form @xcite @xmath47^{1/(q-1)}\\pm 1 } \\ ; , \\label{distri}\\ ] ] where the @xmath48 sign is for fermions , the @xmath49 for bosons and @xmath50 . in the limit @xmath22 ( extensive statistics )",
    ", one recovers the conventional fermi ",
    "dirac and bose ",
    "einstein distribution .",
    "let us remind that the tsallis generalized statistics does not entail a violation of the pauli exclusion principle and does not modify the inclusive behavior of the bosons , but it modifies , with the generalized nonextensive entropy ( [ tsaen ] ) , the extensive nature of the standard statistics .",
    "at the equilibrium , the nonextensive statistics implies a finite temperature particle distribution different from the standard fermi  dirac and bose ",
    "einstein distributions ; in the classical limit , one has the following generalized maxwell ",
    "boltzmann distribution @xcite : @xmath51^{1/(1-q ) } \\;. \\label{distribz}\\ ] ] when the entropic @xmath20 parameter is smaller than @xmath52 , the distributions ( [ distri ] ) and ( [ distribz ] ) have a natural high energy cut  off : @xmath53+\\mu$ ] , which implies that the energy tail is depleted ; when @xmath20 is greater than @xmath52 , the cut  off is absent and the energy tail of the particle distribution ( for fermions and bosons ) is enhanced .",
    "hence the nonextensive statistics entails a sensible difference of the particle distribution shape in the high energy region with respect to the standard statistics .",
    "this property plays an important rle in the interpretation of the physical observables , as it will be shown in the following .",
    "the applicability of the equilibrium statistical mechanics relies on the recognition that the experimental transverse mass spectrum and the relative abundance of charged particles ( pions , kaons , protons , etc . )",
    "can be described within the equilibrium formalism .",
    "the single particle spectrum can be expressed as an integral over a freeze  out hypersurface @xmath54 @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the degeneracy factor and @xmath57 is the phase  space distribution .    indeed , by assuming a purely thermal source with a boltzmann distribution , the transverse mass spectrum can be expressed as follows : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the first order modified bessel function . in the asymptotic limit , @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) ,",
    "the above expression gives rise to the exponential shape @xmath63 which is usually employed to fit the experimental transverse mass spectra and provides an indication of a thermal energy distribution .",
    "although , from a general perspective , the experimental distribution of particle momenta in the transverse direction is described by an exponentially decreasing behavior , at higher energies the experimental data deviate from the usual boltzmann slope .",
    "this discrepancy can be cured by introducing the dynamical effect of a collective transverse flow which predicts the so  called blue shift factor , i.e. , an increase of the slope parameter @xmath11 at large @xmath64 .",
    "the experimental slope parameter measures the particle energy , which contains both thermal ( random ) and collective ( mainly due to rescattering ) contributions .",
    "the thermal motion determines the freeze  out temperature @xmath65 , namely the temperature when particles cease to interact with each other . in the presence of a collective transverse flow @xcite one",
    "can extract @xmath65 from the empirical relation @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a fit parameter which can be identified with the average collective flow velocity ; the latter is consistent with zero in @xmath68 reactions , but can be large in collisions between heavy nuclei ( where rescattering is expected to be important ) . in eq.([tslope ] ) , @xmath69 is the mass of the detected particle ( e.g. pions , kaons , protons ) .",
    "let us consider a different point of view and argue that the deviation from the boltzmann slope at high @xmath15 can be ascribed to the presence of nonextensive statistical effects in the steady state distribution of the particle gas ; the latter do not exclude the physical effect of a collective flow but rather incorporates a description of it from a slightly different statistical mechanics analysis .",
    "if long tail time memory and long  range interactions are present , as already discussed in sec.[qcd_sec ] , the maxwell  boltzmann distribution must be replaced by the generalized distribution ( [ distribz ] ) .",
    "we consider here only small deviations from standard statistics ( @xmath70 ) ; then at first order in @xmath71 the transverse mass spectrum can be written as @xmath72   \\right\\ } \\ ; , \\label{mpt}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the modified bessel function of the third order . in the asymptotic limit , @xmath62 ( but always for @xmath20 values close to 1 , such that @xmath74 )",
    ", we obtain the following generalization of eq.([mps ] ) : @xmath75    from the above equation it is easy to see that at first order in @xmath71 the generalized slope parameter becomes the quantity @xmath76 , defined as @xmath77 hence nonextensive statistics predicts , _ in a purely thermal source _ , a generalized @xmath20blue shift factor at high @xmath64 ; moreover this shift factor is not constant but increases ( if @xmath45 ) with @xmath78 , where @xmath69 is the mass of the detected particle .",
    "we have in this case an effect very similar to the one described by the phenomenological eq.([tslope ] ) .",
    "we remark that the proposed distribution of eq.([mpst ] ) , based on the nonextensive thermostatistics , has the same high @xmath15 dependence of the parameterization reported in ref.@xcite to fit the transverse distribution for central pb+pb collisions .",
    "the value of the entropic parameter @xmath20 is a measure of the nonextensivity of the system and , as a consequence , it should be fixed by the reaction under consideration . on the basis of the above considerations , at a fixed reaction energy , one should find that larger value of @xmath20 are required for heavier colliding nuclei , because at higher energy density we have a larger probability for the phase transition to be achieved .",
    "a quantitative description of the particle production in nonextensive statistics goes beyond of the scope of this paper ; it is fair to assume that eq.([mpst ] ) , for @xmath45 value , can be in good agreement with experimental results in heavy ion collisions . in this framework , indeed , one can understand the slower decrease ( for heavier colliding nuclei ) of the pion phase  space distribution with increasing @xmath15 .",
    "it is worth noticing that for small deviations from the standard statistics ( @xmath79 ) the experimental midrapidity transverse mass distributions are well reproduced with the same slope parameter of ref .",
    "@xcite , within the statistical errors .    in the next section",
    "we shall calculate the measure of the transverse momentum fluctuations in the framework of the equilibrium nonextensive statistics .",
    "we notice that , since small nonextensive statistical effects are consistent with the experimental transverse mass spectrum , we can use , in what follows , the same temperature extracted from the standard analysis of the experimental results .",
    "in ref.@xcite , gadzicki and mrwczyski have introduced a quantity @xmath80 , which measures the event  by  event fluctuations and does not explicitly depend on the particle multiplicity , but appears to be sensitive to the correlations .",
    "it is defined as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a variable such as energy or transverse momentum , @xmath83 is a single particle variable and @xmath84 is the corresponding sum  variable , @xmath85 being the number of the particles in the event .",
    "a non  vanishing value of the measure @xmath80 implies that there is an effective correlation among particles ( dynamical or statistical ) which alters the momentum distribution .",
    "it is usually assumed that if the experimental value of @xmath80 turns out to be constant in going from n+n to a+a collisions , then nucleus  nucleus collisions can be described as an incoherent superposition of elementary n+n scattering processes and the correlations among particles are unchanged @xcite .",
    "we wish here to point out that this might not be the case : indeed it will be shown that similar values of @xmath80 can be attributed to different statistical correlations , which in turn reflect distinct dynamical situations .",
    "recently the correlation measure @xmath86 of the pion transverse momentum has been measured by na49 collaboration .",
    "the experimental results correspond to a value @xmath87 mev for pb+pb at 158 a gev and to @xmath88 mev in the preliminary measurements of the p+p collisions at the same energy @xcite .",
    "however , in their most recent analysis of the pb+pb data , the na49 collaboration has estimated a contribution of @xmath89  mev from the statistical two  particle correlation function alone and an `` anti  correlation '' contribution of @xmath90  mev , stemming from the limitation in the two  track resolution of the na49 apparatus @xcite .",
    "hence it appears that the actual physical values both for p+p and for pb+pb collisions are nearly equal . in any case , as it was observed in the same paper , the physical origin of transverse momentum fluctuation remarkably changes from pb+pb to p+p collisions and , although the pion transverse correlation measure has been studied within many different theoretical approaches , the obtained results are somewhat controversial and not well understood @xcite",
    ".    we will show in the following that the physical differences in the origin of the pion transverse momentum fluctuations in pb+pb collisions with respect to the p+p ones can be understood in the framework of the nonextensive statistics .",
    "for this purpose , keeping in mind that the whole mathematical structure of the thermodynamical relations is preserved in the nonextensive statistics , it is easy to show that the two terms in the right hand side of eq.([phix ] ) can be expressed in the following simple form @xmath91 and @xmath92 where the quantity @xmath93 is the average transverse momentum , @xmath94 in the above equations we have indicated with @xmath95 the mean occupation number of eq.([distri ] ) extended to the continuum and with @xmath96 the generalized particle fluctuations , given by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the relativistic energy @xmath99 . for @xmath100 , one recovers the well  known text ",
    "book expression for the fluctuations of fermions ( @xmath49 ) and bosons ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "eq.([qz2 g ] ) shows that the correlation measure @xmath80 arises from the particle fluctuations ; this result does not come as a surprise since it is well known that the particle fluctuations are related to the two  body density or to the isothermal compressibility by means of the so  called ornstein",
    " zernike relation @xcite .    in the standard extensive statistics ( @xmath100 ) ,",
    "one obtains that the correlation measure @xmath80 is always negative for fermions and positive for bosons , while it vanishes in the classical standard statistics @xcite .",
    "indeed @xmath101 is defined in terms of the fluctuations @xmath102 , which , for the ideal fermi  dirac ( bose  einstein ) gas , are suppressed ( enhanced ) with respect to the classical case . in the nonextensive tsallis statistics , the fluctuations of an ideal gas of fermions ( bosons ) , expressed by eq.([fluc ] ) , are still suppressed ( enhanced ) by the factor @xmath103 ; this effect , however , is modulated by the factor @xmath104^{-1}$ ] in the right hand side of eq.([fluc ] ) .",
    "therefore the fluctuations turn out to be increased for @xmath43 ( we remind that due to the energy cut  off condition the above factor is always positive ) and are decreased for @xmath45 .",
    "the measure @xmath80 does not have , both for bosons and fermions , a constant sign and it is positive or negative depending on the value of the entropic parameter @xmath20 . in the classical nonextensive case we also have @xmath105 .",
    "the quantity @xmath106 is greater than @xmath107 for @xmath43 , and smaller for @xmath45 and the correlation measure @xmath80 can be different from zero for @xmath108 .",
    "this is essentially due to the intrinsic nature of the system in the presence of memory effects and/or long  range forces and to the dependence of the ( multi)particle distribution functions upon the surrounding medium .",
    "we use eqs.([qz2p ] ) and ( [ qz2 g ] ) to evaluate the correlation measure @xmath86 for the pion gas ( @xmath109 mev ) , which we can compare with the experimental results measured in the central pb+pb collision by the na49 collaboration @xcite .",
    "let us notice that the values of @xmath86 , which depends on @xmath11 , @xmath110 and the entropic parameter @xmath20 , are very sensitive to small variations of @xmath20 .",
    "this is mainly due to the modified expression ( [ fluc ] ) of the fluctuations in the nonextensive statistics .    in fig .",
    "[ qmute ] we show @xmath86 as a function of the parameter @xmath20 , at different ( fixed ) values of the temperature and chemical potential .",
    "the experimental data are reported up to a maximum value of the transverse momentum @xmath111  gev : hence we have limited the integration up to the upper limit of @xmath112 gev .",
    "concerning the temperature @xmath11 , we use the slope parameter derived from the fit of the transverse momentum spectra @xcite . with @xmath113  mev and @xmath114 mev",
    "( according to the suggestion of @xcite ) , we obtain @xmath115 mev with @xmath116 , while the usual extensive statistics , with @xmath100 , gives @xmath117 mev ( we remind that a non  vanishing value of @xmath110 implies that there is no chemical equilibrium ) .    by choosing @xmath118 mev one can obtain the same value @xmath119 mev with a smaller @xmath20 ( @xmath120 ) . in this case , with @xmath100 , @xmath121 mev .",
    "thus , a very little deviation from the standard bose ",
    "einstein distribution is sufficient to obtain theoretical estimates in agreement with the experimental results .",
    "we notice also that the value employed , @xmath46 , justifies , a posteriori , the approximation of the analytical form of the distribution function ( [ distri ] ) and the validity of eq.([mpt ] ) for the transverse mass spectrum .",
    "the correlations are much more affected by deviations from the extensive statistics than the single particle observables , such as the transverse mass distribution .",
    "we can obtain a very good agreement with the experimental results of @xmath86 , still being consistent with the other single particle measurements .    in this context",
    ", it is worth noticing that , even for small deviations from the standard statistics , an appreciable difference in the distribution function and in the fluctuations ( with respect to the standard ones ) appears _ especially _ in the region of high transverse momenta .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the interpretation of the nonextensive statistics effects , since the detected high energy pions should be essentially the primary ones , hence more sensitive to the early stage of the collisions . in order to show this fact ,",
    "we have evaluated the partial contributions to the quantity @xmath86 , by using eq.s ( [ qz2p ] ) and ( [ qz2 g ] ) , and by extending the integration over @xmath15 to partial intervals @xmath122  gev .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[isto ] , at @xmath113 mev and @xmath114 mev . in the standard statistics ( dashed line ) , @xmath86 is always positive and vanishes in the @xmath15intervals above @xmath123 gev . in the nonextensive statistics ( solid line ) , instead , the fluctuation measure @xmath86 becomes negative for @xmath15 larger than @xmath124 gev and becomes vanishingly small only in @xmath15intervals above @xmath125 gev .    in view of these considerations ,",
    "we suggest an analysis of the pb+pb measurements which allows to disentangle the contributions to @xmath86 in different @xmath15 s intervals . a negative value of @xmath86 at high transverse momentum intervals could be a clear evidence of the presence of a nonextensive regime .",
    "the nonextensive statistics appears suitable to evaluate physical observables recently measured in heavy ion collision experiments .",
    "the spectrum of the transverse momentum can be reproduced by means of the nonextensive distribution , which naturally takes into account typical collective effects in heavy colliding nuclei such as the increasing of the slope parameter with high @xmath15 and high particle masses . the calculated correlation measure @xmath86 agrees with the experimental value by considering a small deviation from the standard statistics . within the nonextensive approach we have also found negative partial contributions to @xmath86 at high @xmath15 ( larger than @xmath124 gev ) . in this regime",
    "the @xmath86 value is not affected by resonance decays : hence an experimental confirmation of our prediction would be an unambiguous signal of the validity of nonextensive statistics in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the quantity @xmath20 is not just a free parameter : it depends on the physical conditions generated in the reaction and , in principle , should be related to microscopic quantities ( such as the mean interparticle interaction length , the screening length and the frequency collision into the parton plasma ) .",
    "we have found that a value of @xmath20 slightly larger than one characterizes the correlation measure @xmath80 , both by suppressing the boson fluctuations in eq.([qz2 g ] ) and by enhancing the importance of the region of large transverse momenta in eq.([qz2p ] ) . in the diffusional approximation ,",
    "a value @xmath45 implies the presence of a superdiffusion among the constituent particles ( the mean square displacement is not linearly proportional to time , having , instead , a power law behavior @xmath126 , with @xmath127 ) .",
    "effects of anomalous diffusion are strongly related to the presence of non  markovian memory interactions and colored noise force in the langevin equation @xcite . in this context",
    ", we note that in ref.@xcite , the qcd chiral phase transition is analyzed in analogy with the metal ",
    "insulator one and it is shown that an anomalous diffusion regime can take place .",
    "the meaning of anomalous diffusion can be found in the presence of multiparticle rescattering , which is very large in pb+pb collisions @xcite .",
    "the early stage of the p+p collision is believed to be radically different from the pb+pb case and the influence of the nonextensive statistics appears not negligible in the last reaction . in these terms the anomalous medium effects and the remarkable experimental differences between light and heavy ion collisions should be better understood .    finally we notice that , for a given value of the deformation parameter @xmath20 , the greater is the mass of the detected particle , the more strongly modified are the fluctuations . for this reason , the present calculation predicts more important nonextensive effects for the correlations of heavier mesons and baryons , than for light particles : future measurements of @xmath86 for these heavier particles should give a more clear evidence of this effect .",
    "furthermore , the nonextensive statistics could imply a sizable modification of the hadronic mass compressibility , since this quantity is strongly related to particle fluctuations ( being more sizably suppressed for particles of heavier masses , of the deformation parameter , we can estimate a reduction of the standard bose ",
    "enhancement factor @xmath128 of about @xmath129 for pions , of @xmath130 for kaons and of @xmath131 for @xmath132 mesons . ] ) @xcite .",
    "we also remind that the nonextensive statistics implies , for @xmath45 , a suppression of the standard boson fluctuations given in eq.([fluc ] ) , which is more effective at high transverse momentum whereas it appears negligible for low momenta .",
    "shuryak suggests@xcite that enhanced fluctuations for low @xmath15 bins , in the pion @xmath15 histograms , are a possible manifestation of disoriented chiral condensation .",
    "we may argue that this effect could be much more evident if one assumes the validity of the generalized statistics .",
    "new data and investigations are necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the high energy heavy  ion observables .",
