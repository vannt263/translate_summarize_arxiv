    "we vary @xmath2 using a 15 m tall atwood machine in which one of the counterweights is a wireless granular laboratory ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the laboratory consists of a cylindrical bucket ( @xmath7 cm diameter by @xmath8 cm depth ) filled with expanded polystyrene beads ( average diameter @xmath95 mm ) . when the bucket is allowed to rise or fall , the granular media and the equipment inside it  feel \" , for a few seconds , a gravitational acceleration @xmath2 different than @xmath5 ( larger if the bucket is rising and smaller if it is falling ) .",
    "as the bucket rises / falls , we release a sphere held at rest just above the free surface and let it sink into the granular medium .",
    "the sphere houses a three - axis wireless accelerometer in its interior , which allows us to record its instantaneous acceleration in real time .",
    "the total mass of the impactor / accelerometer is @xmath10  g , light enough to prevent the `` infinite penetration '' encountered by pacheco _",
    "_ @xcite .    in fig .",
    "2(_a _ ) we plot the time - dependence of the sphere s acceleration @xmath11 vs.  time @xmath12 relative to the bucket ( normalized by earth s gravity @xmath13  9.8  m / s@xmath1 ) for six representative values of @xmath2 ( note we define positive acceleration as pointing downward ) .",
    "each curve has three well defined sections : ( i ) an initial region of positive slope corresponding to the release of the sphere ( this is caused by magnetic forces of the release mechanism and occurs in the first @xmath950 ms ) , ( ii ) a second region of negative slope , where most of the penetration process takes place , and ( iii ) a third region of positive slope which includes the sudden stopping of the sphere ( note this sudden arrest was also seen in previous experiments performed at @xmath14 ) .",
    "in contrast with most studies in the literature , our ultralight granular medium permits us to observe the initial positive segment during which the frictional forces on the granular medium are small .",
    "we also note the presence of a brief , damped oscillation that occurs near the instant the sphere comes to rest , which suggests a `` shock '' against a jammed granular  wall \" ( as shown later , this feature is reproduced in our dem simulations ) .",
    "the oscillations in the @xmath11 vs. @xmath12 curves are not symptomatic of the resolution of our accelerometer but instead are real fluctuations from the granular medium ( we confirm this in the simulation results , which show similar oscillations ) .    .",

    "comparison of the different curves in fig .",
    "2(_a _ ) shows that as @xmath2 decreases from the blue curve ( near uranus gravity ) to the red curve ( near mars gravity ) , the peak acceleration increases while the depth of the minimum decreases .",
    "what s more , the duration of the process as a whole increases .",
    "this point is made particularly clear in fig .",
    "2(_b _ ) , where we integrate @xmath11 vs. @xmath12 and plot the velocities @xmath15 vs. @xmath12 , which also shows that the maximum speed of the sphere increases with higher @xmath2 . in fig .",
    "2(_c _ ) , we integrate once more to plot the distance travelled below the surface @xmath16 vs. @xmath12 , which reveals the key observation that the final penetration depth @xmath18 is essentially the same for all @xmath2 ( average value @xmath19 cm ) .",
    "if instead of plotting the acceleration vs. @xmath12 we plot it against @xmath16 ( normalized by @xmath2 , as in fig .",
    "2(_d _ ) ) , we collapse the data to a line with slight upward curvature ( apart from the brief initial and final moments , corresponding to sections ( i ) and ( iii ) , respectively ) .",
    "figure  3(_a - d _ ) shows the corresponding simulation results for similar gravitational accelerations to those used in the experiments . with the exception of the brief time period in which the magnet turns off ( which we did not simulate ) , the simulation results are strikingly similar to the experiments .",
    "several experimental features are reproduced quantitatively with no free parameters , _",
    "e.g. _ the duration of the penetration process , the size of the acceleration peaks , the maximum velocities and the final penetration depth .",
    "even the sudden drop to zero acceleration and the acceleration fluctuations ( which could have been interpreted as noise ) are present .",
    "closer inspection here also reveals that the fluctuations in the acceleration become stronger as the sphere motion comes closer to stopping .",
    "this behavior may be associated with the building up and breaking down of force chains during the penetration process , suggesting the stopping and eventual static support of the intruder is associated with the medium transitioning from a fluidized to jammed state @xcite .    .",

    "( d ) normalized sphere acceleration @xmath17 vs. penetration distance @xmath16 . ]      in fig .  4 , we present the combined experimental and simulation results for the final sink depth @xmath18 ( fig .  4(a ) ) and sink time @xmath20 ( fig .  4(b ) ) , which shows that @xmath18 is essentially independent of @xmath2 while @xmath20 scales like @xmath21 .",
    "the fact that the penetration depth of the sinking sphere is independent of @xmath2 is both surprising and puzzling . to begin to explain it , we look to the work of pacheco - vzquez _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who proposed a simple equation of motion for an object impacting into a granular medium , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the impactor mass , @xmath24 characterizes any intertial drag , @xmath25 is a friction - like coefficient related to the pressure in the granular medium ( units [ n / m ] ) , and @xmath26 is a characteristic length of the order of the width of the container holding the medium .",
    "( the exponential term arises from the well - known janssen effect in which the pressure in a granular system saturates at a finite depth owing to redistribution of weight to the container walls @xcite . ) in recent experiments of a sphere falling through a tall silo of polystyrene beads at earth gravity , it was found that the combination of the inertial drag term ( @xmath27 ) and the saturating , depth dependent pressure term ( _ i.e. _ the exponential ) can lead to `` infinite penetration '' of the projectile at a constant , terminal velocity if its mass is sufficiently large . here",
    ", however , because the sphere starts at rest and is relatively light , we can ignore the drag term ( the maximum velocity we see is @xmath28 m / s and the small values of @xmath24 involved @xcite put the term @xmath29 approximately one order of magnitude smaller than the other terms during the whole penetration process ) .",
    "thus , the equation of motion can be approximated as @xmath30 this proposed form quickly explains the shape of the @xmath17 vs. @xmath16 curves shown in fig .",
    "2(_d _ ) ( and in particular reproduces the slight upwards curvature ) . by fitting each of the @xmath17 vs. @xmath16 curves with eq .",
    "[ eq : pachecosmallv ] while using the bucket radius for the parameter @xmath26 and leaving @xmath25 as a free parameter , we find the linear relationship @xmath31 , where @xmath32  ns@xmath33m@xmath1 , as shown in fig.4(_c _ ) .",
    "this linear relationship has been proposed before ( see , for example , @xcite ) , but here we demonstrate its validity at different gravities for the first time .",
    "other experiments that have imitated effective gravities ( by flowing air upwards through the grains @xcite or with granular - liquid mixtures @xcite ) have interpreted this relationship as arising from the loading of frictional forces in grain - grain contacts inside the granular media , and our findings explicitly confirm this is the case .    beyond being consistent with the @xmath11 vs.  @xmath16 curves from the experiments and simulations , this model also predicts the observation that the total sink time scales like @xmath34 . to show this , we begin by rewriting eq .",

    "consequently , we conclude that @xmath42 .",
    "finally , we can also show that the final sink depth of the sphere , @xmath18 , is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "when the sphere reaches its resting spot , the velocity vanishes and thus we can set the lefthand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : scott2 ] to zero , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath43 this is a well - known transcendental equation that can not be solved analytically .",
    "however , quick inspection of it reveals immediately that @xmath18 is _ independent _ of the gravitational acceleration as @xmath2 does not appear anywhere in the equation . though we ca nt get an analytic solution for @xmath18 , we can use the experimental parameters @xmath44 m and @xmath45 ns@xmath1/m@xmath1 to solve eq .",
    "[ eq : z_sink ] numerically for our system , which gives @xmath46",
    "m , close to what we actually measure .",
    "the fact that it is somewhat larger may result from ignoring the velocity term in eq .",
    "[ eq : pacheco ] , which would tend to make the sphere stop a little earlier .",
    "( indeed , numerically solving the the differential equation [ eq .  [ eq : pacheco ] ] directly with the value for @xmath24 from pacheco _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite gives the value @xmath47 m , in better agreement still with the data from the experiments and simulations . )",
    "our work here is the first report on the full penetration dynamics of an object sinking into granular media at different gravitational accelerations . by using a freely - falling experimental laboratory , we are able to investigate gravitational environments both larger and smaller than that of earth , ranging roughly from the conditions of mars to uranus .",
    "we reproduce and extend the range of these results with the aid of dem simulations , which highlight the importance of transient force fluctuations in the penetration process that may be related to the continual build up and break down of granular force chains . in both the experiments and simulations , we make a counter - intuitive observation in the sinking process that has important implications for extraterrestrial navigation and engineering , namely that the final sink depth of an object set at rest on granular media is _ independent _ of the ambient gravitational acceleration .",
    "we are able to explain this peculiar observation with a force law which includes a depth dependent frictional term that is proportional to @xmath2 , which effectively removes any gravitational term from the equation of motion at the point of static equilibrium .",
    "this finding in particular suggests that earth - based experiments aimed at reproducing the conditions of a robot navigation on or a structure being built on another planet or asteroid should be performed without  adjusting \" the mass of the device for the new gravity conditions .",

    "the granular media consists of expanded polystyrene particles with a density of @xmath50  g / cc and a diameter distribution ranging from approximately @xmath51 to @xmath52 mm ( with a peak at @xmath53  mm ) . to ensure that the system has a similar initial configuration each experiment , we use the following procedure adapted from torres _",
    "et al . _",
    "first , we inject air from below through a wire mesh with a pressure ramp just until the top of the bed just becomes fluidized .",
    "then we slowly lower the pressure until there is zero flow .",

    "this process repeatably produces a volume fraction of @xmath57 and maximum angle of stability of @xmath58 .",
    "the sphere is quickly released into free - fall with the aide of a magnetic latch .",
    "the exact moment of release is determined by remotely observing the bucket acceleration with a computer and , once it is confirmed that the bucket moves with constant acceleration @xmath2 , deactivating the latch .",
    "care is taken to ensure that little lateral motion occurs and that at release the bottom of the sphere is just gently touching the free granular surface .",
