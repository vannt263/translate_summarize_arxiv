    "the casimir effect is the physical manifestation of the change in the zero point energy of a quantum field for different configurations .",
    "the zero point configuration refers to one in which there does not exist any on - shell physical excitation of the field .",
    "the difference in the configurations could arise either from the imposition of different boundary conditions on the fields , or the presence of non - trivial spatial backgrounds ( _ e.g. _ solitons ) . in 1948",
    "casimir predicted the existence of this effect as an attractive force between two infinite parallel uncharged perfectly conducting plates in vacuum @xcite .",
    "this effect was subsequently observed experimentally by sparnaay in 1958 @xcite ( for a general review on the casimir effect , see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "recently , similar measurements have been done for other geometries , and their precisions have been greatly improved @xcite .",
    "the manifestations of the casimir effect have been studied in many different areas of physics .",
    "for example , the magnitude of the cosmological constant has been estimated using the casimir effect @xcite .",
    "the effect has been also studied within the context of string theory @xcite .",
    "recently this effect has been investigated in connection with the properties of the space - time with extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "the majority of the investigations related to the casimir effect concern the calculation of this energy or the resulting forces for different fields in different geometries , such as parallel plates @xcite , cubes @xcite , cylinders @xcite , and spherical geometries @xcite .",
    "an interesting question is the determination of the conditions under which the forces acting on the boundaries for closed geometries are attractive or repulsive in arbitrary spatial dimensions @xcite . we should mention that in the calculations of the casimir energy many different regularization schemes or renormalization programs have been used to remove the divergences , and some of these techniques",
    "have been compared with each other @xcite . however , there are sometimes ambiguities associated with the analytic continuation techniques .",
    "ambjrn and wolfram @xcite were the first to calculate the casimir energy in higher space - time dimensions , and in particular derived an expression for the change in the vacuum energy due to a rectangular box with p sides in d - dimensions for a massless and a massive scalar field by summing the zero point energy of the eigenmodes .",
    "the divergences were removed by using the following regularization and analytic continuation procedures : zeta function regularization , dimensional regularization , and the reflection formula .",
    "the results are given in terms of the epstein zeta function@xcite .",
    "then , using analogies between em and massless scalar fields , the casimir energy for the em radiation was indirectly deduced for the te and tm modes in a perfectly conducting rectangular box .    for the case of cavities ,",
    "this energy has been calculated directly for both the em field and scalar fields .",
    "usually two different methods are used .",
    "the more routine one involves the aforementioned regularization and analytic continuation procedures .",
    "the main ingredient of the second method is the subtraction of two comparable configurations , sometimes supplemented by some regularization procedures , such as the use of convergence factors .",
    "the latter procedure was first used by boyer for the calculation of the the em casimir energy in a spherical cavity@xcite , where he subtracted the zero point energies of two concentric spheres , but with different sized inner cores .",
    "analogous methods were used for two parallel plates @xcite and rectangular cavities @xcite .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to directly derive a closed form expression for the casimir energy for the em field in a open - ended rectangular geometry in three spatial dimensions , which we shall henceforth call a waveguide .",
    "we do this by directly finding the em modes , quantizing the resulting field , and calculating the zero point energy .",
    "we then obtain the casimir energy using first the usual program which involves complicated analytic continuation techniques including zeta function and reflection formula , and second , a slight modification of the boyer s method , henceforth called the box subtraction scheme ( bss ) .",
    "as we shall show , in the latter procedure there is no need for any use of analytic continuation techniques , and all of the divergences can be removed without any ambiguities .",
    "both of the results turn out to be equivalent to those of @xcite .",
    "therefore , the secondary purpose of our work is to check the complicated analytic continuation techniques in common use .",
    "however , either of our direct approaches to the problem has the advantage of being easily extendable to higher orders in perturbation theory@xcite .    in the section 2",
    ", we calculate the em modes and the resulting zero point energy in a rectangular waveguide . in section 3 ,",
    "we first calculate the casimir energy using the zeta function regularization , and then introduce the bss to recalculate this energy .",
    "we then compare our results with those of @xcite .",
    "we then show that our results for a rectangular waveguide of cross sectional area @xmath0 agrees with the established results for a cavity in the appropriate limit .",
    "then , we show that our results for the waveguide reduces to those of the two infinite parallel plates , in the appropriate limit .",
    "we then plot the casimir energy per unit volume , its contour plot per unit volume , and the casimir energy per unit length , all as a function of the cross - sectional lengths of the waveguide .",
    "we then define and calculate the pressures on different sides and plot them .",
    "we also present a physical discussion about the rather peculiar effect of the change in the sign of one of the pressures as a function of the shape of the cross - sectional area .",
    "we summarize our results in section 4 .",
    "the lagrangian density for the electromagnetic field is : @xmath1 for a conducting uncharged waveguide the electric and magnetic fields can be easily written in terms of the vector potential for example in coulomb gauge(see ref.@xcite ) . therefore to derive the em modes , it is sufficient to calculate the vector potential in the waveguide .",
    "however it is easier to find the physical fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and then calculate the corresponding vector potential .",
    "this is due to the fact that it is easier to impose the boundary conditions on the physical fields . for this purpose ,",
    "we need only compute @xmath4 for tm modes , and @xmath5 for te modes , where @xmath6 is defined to be the main axis of the waveguide .",
    "the rest of the components can be calculated using the maxwell equations .",
    "explicit expressions for all components of the em fields are shown in[calculation1 ] .",
    "now , for each mode the vector potential @xmath7 can be written in terms of the electric field as : @xmath8 and its conjugate momenta is defined as : @xmath9 where @xmath10 indicate \\{te , tm } modes , respectively , and @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 define the cross - sectional dimensions of the rectangular waveguide . since the set of all modes in the waveguide are complete and orthonormal , one can expand the classical em field in terms of them @xcite , @xmath14 }    \\\\    \\hspace{-1 cm }    \\dd + \\sum\\limits_{m = 1}^\\infty \\int   { \\frac{{ldk_z } } { { 2\\pi } } }    { \\left [ { c^{te } \\left ( { \\bf{k } } \\right){\\bf{a}}_{m0}^{te }    \\left ( { { \\bf{x}},t } \\right ) + c.c . }",

    "we use the canonical quantization method to quantize the field in the waveguide . for this purpose",
    "we let , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are creation and annihilation operators .",
    "now we impose the usual canonical commutation relations on the fields and their conjugate momenta , @xmath20 & = & \\left [ { \\pi _ i^\\lambda    \\left ( { { \\bf{x}},t } \\right),\\pi _ j^{\\lambda ' } \\left (    { { \\bf{x'}},t } \\right ) } \\right ] = 0,\\nonumber\\\\\\left [ { { a}_i^\\lambda \\left (    { { \\bf{x}},t } \\right),\\pi _ j^{\\lambda ' } \\left ( { { \\bf{x'}},t }    \\right ) } \\right ] & = & i\\hbar \\delta _ { \\lambda \\lambda ' } \\delta _ { ij }    \\delta \\left ( { { \\bf{x } } - { \\bf{x ' } } } \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and this will result in the usual canonical commutation relations between the @xmath19 and @xmath18@xcite .",
    "using this relation along with eq.([e7 ] ) we can find the normalization coefficients @xmath21 .    according to eq.([lagrangian den . ] ) , the hamiltonian is : @xmath22 integrating over the volume of the waveguide gives the energy , and the vacuum expectation value of energy inside the waveguide is : @xmath23 which simply means that the electromagnetic vacuum energy inside the waveguide is the sum of the zero point energies of all possible modes .",
    "this sum , and its analogues in any quantum field theory , always turn out to be infinite .",
    "we obtained an expression for the zero point energy for the em field in a rectangular waveguide in the previous section .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the main purposes of this paper is to first obtain the casimir energy using directly the em field , and to avoid any use of analytic continuation techniques , utilizing bss .",
    "now we calculate the resulting casimir energy by two different methods .",
    "first is the conventional method involving the usual regularization programs and the ensuing analytic continuations , and second is our method .",
    "we shall find that these two methods yield identical results for the leading order case , which agrees with the results obtained indirectly in @xcite .",
    "the total energy of the vacuum for the em field inside the waveguide is given in eq.([e12 ] ) .",
    "high frequency modes render these sums formally divergent .",
    "our first procedure involves the usual zeta function regularization .",
    "that is , we shall compute the following expression @xmath24 which is convergent for @xmath25 . by calculating the integral in eq.([zeta.reg . ] ) and using the definition of the epstein zeta function @xcite we obtain , @xmath26.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the simple analytic continuation @xmath27 leads to divergent result ! however , we can use a simplified version of the reflection formula@xcite applicable to this problem , @xmath28 the analytic continuation embedded in the reflection formula eliminates all of the infinities , and the final expression for the casimir energy in terms of the epstein zeta function can be written as@xcite : @xmath29.\\ ] ]    as outlined above , the first method uses complicated analytic continuation techniques .",
    "we share the point of view with some authors that in general the use of analytic continuation techniques could lead to ambiguities @xcite .",
    "this ambiguity has already shown up in our calculations , as explicitly stated in the sentence below eq.([eps.zeta . ] ) .",
    "this is why we think it is worthwhile to obtain the casimir energy by a method which does not use such techniques . as a first step towards this goal , we introduce two similar configurations , each of which consists of a waveguide enclosed in a larger one of cross - sectional area @xmath30 , as shown in fig.([fig.1 ] ) .",
    "the casimir energy can now be defined as : @xmath31,\\ ] ]     left figure is  @xmath32 configuration \" and right one is ",
    "@xmath33 configuration\".,width=302 ]     left figure is  @xmath34 configuration \" and right one is ",
    "@xmath35 configuration\".,width=302 ]    where @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is the energy of configuration a ( b ) , and @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "subtraction of the zero point energy of b from a is equivalent to the work done in deforming the configuration b to a. therefore , having chosen the same @xmath40 for both configurations , we expect this quantity per unit length to be finite on physical grounds and to depend only on the dimensions of the original waveguide . to calculate the casimir energy",
    "it is necessary to have an expression for all the em modes in the whole configuration .",
    "however , calculation of the em modes in the middle regions is very cumbersome .",
    "therefore , to simplify the task , without any loss of generality , we define an alternative set of configurations in fig.([fig.2 ] ) .",
    "we can then define the casimir energy as in eq.([e14 ] ) , but with following replacement @xmath41 and @xmath42 . as we shall show explicitly in [ calculation2 ] ,",
    "as expected , all of the infinities automatically cancel each other out upon subtracting the zero point energies of the two configurations , even for finite values of @xmath43 .",
    "it is important to note that for any finite value of @xmath40 the casimir energies of the two sets of configurations depicted in figs.([fig.1 ] ) and ( [ fig.2 ] ) will differ by a finite amount , after the automatic cancelation of all the infinities .",
    "however , as we shall show explicitly in [ calculation2 ] , the difference between the remaining finite terms due to the boundary waveguides in the @xmath44 configuration go to zero in the limit @xmath45 .",
    "therefore the difference in the energies of the two sets of waveguides in the @xmath44 configuration in the limit @xmath45 , is only due to the difference between the two inner waveguides and this can be properly defined to be the casimir energy .",
    "we can solve the problem using bss by first using the abel - plana summation formula ( apsf ) @xcite for the sums in our main equation for the zero point energy , eq.([e12 ] ) , @xmath46   = \\mathop { \\lim } \\limits_{\\frac{b_1}{a},\\frac{b_2}{a } \\to \\infty }    \\left\\ { { \\mathop { \\lim } \\limits_{\\frac{r}{b } \\to \\infty } \\frac{{\\hbar c}}{2}\\int   { \\frac{{ldk_z } } { { 2\\pi } } }    \\left [ { \\sum\\limits_{n = 1}^\\infty   { g\\left ( n \\right ) } } \\right ] } \\right\\ } \\\\ \\hspace{-2.5 cm }    & = & \\dd\\mathop { \\lim } \\limits_{\\frac{b_1}{a},\\frac{b_2}{a } \\to \\infty }    \\left\\ { { \\mathop { \\lim } \\limits_{\\frac{r}{b } \\to \\infty } \\frac{{\\hbar c}}{2}\\int { \\frac{{ldk_z } } { { 2\\pi } } }    \\left [ { \\frac { { - 1}}{2}g\\left ( 0 \\right ) + \\int_0^\\infty   dx{g\\left ( x \\right ) } { \\rm { } } +    i\\int_0^\\infty   dt{\\frac{{g\\left ( { it } \\right ) - g\\left ( { - it } \\right)}}{{e^{2\\pi t }   - 1 } } } { \\rm { } } } \\right ] }    \\right\\},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is defined in the [ calculation2 ] . the calculations for each term in the integrand is very lengthy , and are done in the [ calculation2 ] .",
    "however , here we like to briefly outline the calculations , especially the cancelation of infinities . the first term in the integrand contains infinite terms some of which , as expected , cancel each other out due to the bss .",
    "however a few infinite terms remain .",
    "similar cancelations occur for the second term .",
    "the remaining infinite terms of these two terms exactly cancel each other out .",
    "the third term ( the branch - cut term ) is finite .",
    "therefore all the infinities cancel each other out due to the bss , without resorting to any analytic continuation techniques , and more surprisingly , even without resorting to any regularization scheme .",
    "the casimir energy can be easily obtained by collecting all the finite pieces from the above three terms which are all of branch - cut types and obtained explicitly in the [ calculation2 ] .",
    "the final expression for the casimir energy , after taking the appropriate limits is , @xmath48     the casimir energy , per unit volume , for the em field inside a perfectly conducting rectangular waveguide in three spatial dimensions with cross - sectional area @xmath49 , in units @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",

    "one can also easily show that the casimir energy obtained here directly from the second quantized form of the em field for any waveguide in three spatial dimensions , using any of our two programs , is identical with the results obtained indirectly in @xcite using analogies between massless scalar field and the em field . as mentioned before , the casimir problem inside a rectangular cavity with perfectly conducting walls has been solved directly and exactly , although the final result is not in a closed form@xcite .",
    "they have computed the limit of their expression reducing to a waveguide with square cross section .",
    "we have computed the limit of their results for the slightly more general case of a waveguide with rectangular cross section and the results are identical to ours .",
    "the other extreme limit of the waveguide is when one of the sides approaches infinity , for example @xmath13 .",
    "then , our result eq.([e18 ] ) , turns out to be exactly the casimir energy for two infinite parallel plates@xcite , @xmath57 the casimir energy density is plotted in fig.([fig.3 ] ) and its contour plot is illustrated in fig.([fig.4 ] ) .",
    "note that in fig.([fig.4 ] ) the regions shaded darker correspond to lower energies .",
    "we can define the casimir pressure @xmath58 on the plate of the waveguide whose perpendicular direction is @xmath59 , and its area is @xmath60 by : @xmath61     the casimir energy , per unit length , as a function of @xmath13 for the em field inside a conducting rectangular waveguide , in units @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",

    "note the existence of a maximum indicates that as @xmath13 increases for fixed @xmath67 , the pressure @xmath63 increases from a negative ( inwards ) to a positive value ( outwards ) , while @xmath68 approaches the value appropriate for the parallel plate problem ( fig.[pressure . ] ) .",
    "analogous findings have been reported for the rectangular cavity problem @xcite .",
    "we have come up with the following physical reasoning for this phenomena : as @xmath13 increases , for fixed @xmath67 , past a critical threshold of about @xmath69 , the total energy starts to decrease although , any two opposite pairs of sides always attract each other .",
    "that is , with any further increase in @xmath13 , the increase in the energy due to the attraction of the sides labeled @xmath70 is more than compensated by the reduction in the energy due to the attraction of the sides labeled @xmath71 .",
    "in this paper , we have obtained the casimir energy for em field in a rectangular waveguide by directly finding the em modes inside the waveguide , and summing over the zero modes of the corresponding second quantized em field operator .",
    "we compute the sums using two completely different methods .",
    "first is the zeta function analytic continuation method .",
    "second , is the bss whose basis is confining the waveguide inside a large one and computing the difference in the vacuum energies in two comparable configurations .",
    "the results of these two techniques are identical",
    ". however , the latter provides a mechanism by which precise cancelations of divergences occur without using any analytic continuation or regularization schemes .",
    "our results also turn out to be identical to those of @xcite in the appropriate limit .",
    "however in reference @xcite the results were obtained indirectly by using some analogies between the em field and massless scalar fields .",
    "the direct method has the added advantage of being easily extendable to calculations of radiative corrections to the casimir energy .",
    "we have also computed and displayed the results for the casimir energy , its density , and pressures as a function of the cross sectional sides of the waveguide .",
    "the physical reasons for the phenomena of the change in the sign of one of the pressures are also given .",
