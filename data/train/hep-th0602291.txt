    "the quantum field theory underlying the strong force of nature is widely accepted as being quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) which is a non - abelian generalization of quantum electrodynamics . at large energy the constituent fields , the quarks and gluons ,",
    "behave as free particles which is a property known as asymptotic freedom . in this case one",
    "performs calculations in qcd based on a vacuum which is empty and which is known as the perturbative vacuum .",
    "however , it is accepted @xcite that the true vacuum of qcd is more complicated and is not the perturbative one .",
    "an indication of this is that in the true vacuum gauge invariant operators condense .",
    "indeed the two operators which receive wide attention are the operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the gluon field strength , @xmath3 is the quark field and @xmath4 is the stong coupling constant .",
    "consequently , it is possible to incorporate the vacuum expectation values @xmath5 and @xmath6 into the operator product expansion in order to determine the effects they have in the measurements of physical quantities and qcd sum rules , @xcite .",
    "indeed it is possible to extract numerical estimates for them .",
    "whilst these operators are the main ones of interest , it has been pointed out more recently that additionally one can construct a dimension two operator in qcd which is gauge invariant , @xcite . however , this is also believed to condense giving rise to @xmath7 power corrections in the operator product expansion and other quantities , @xcite",
    ". specifically the operator is @xmath8 { \\cal v}^{-1 }    \\label{nonlocop}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 represents the set of all gauge configurations and @xmath10 is constructed in such a way that it is in fact gauge invariant .",
    "consequently , unlike @xmath11 and @xmath1 , the operator is non - local but can be written in terms of the usual gluon gauge field yielding a power series in @xmath12 when evaluated explicitly .",
    "this dimension two operator has been the subject of intense study in recent years , mostly from the point of view of trying to estimate a value for its vacuum expectation value , @xcite .",
    "further , the role a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value of a dimension two operator had on the estimate of glueball masses in the coulomb gauge had been discussed earlier in @xcite .",
    "having a non - zero vacuum expectation value for this operator has interesting implications for trying to understand the properties of qcd and for phenomenology .",
    "one area of study has been on the lattice where there appears to be numerical evidence for @xmath13 power corrections in a variety of quantities @xcite .",
    "for example , an effective strong coupling constant , @xmath14 , requires a @xmath13 correction to correctly fit lattice data in the range @xmath15-@xmath16 gev , @xcite .",
    "this necessitates a dimension two object on dimensional grounds .",
    "another consequence is that such a dimension two condensate would imply that the gluon has an effective mass which is generated dynamically , @xcite . estimates for the value of such a mass have been summarized in table @xmath17 of field s article @xcite .",
    "these have been extracted from phenomenology where one includes a gluon with a mass in order to fit experimental data more accurately .",
    "however , one of the main interests in understanding gluon mass is its relationship to the confinement mechanism .",
    "whilst there are various ideas about what underlies this property of qcd and the strong force , the actual situation has not been determined yet .",
    "one point of view is that of abelian dominance @xcite .",
    "essentially this is based on the premise that in the infrared the abelian sector of the gluon field dominates .",
    "it is then believed that the infrared sector of qcd could be described by a dual superconductor , whereby a monopole condensation would give rise to confinement via the dual meissner effect . moreover , in the context of the generation of an effective gluon mass , one viewpoint is that in the infrared the gluons associated with the centre of the colour group remain massless whilst the off - diagonal gluons gain a mass dynamically .",
    "indeed there appears to be some preliminary lattice evidence for such a scenario , @xcite . to investigate such a hypothesis in qcd from a field theory point of view requires both a calculational technique to handle dimension two operator condensation as well as a way of focusing on the centre gluon fields .",
    "for the former , the local composite operator ( lco ) method has been developed both for qcd , @xcite , and for models such as the two dimensional gross - neveu model @xcite , where one has the exact mass gap to justify the approach . to examine the differing nature of the gluon field",
    ", one can choose to fix in the maximal abelian gauge ( mag ) where the gauge fixing differentiates between centre and off - diagonal gluons .",
    "in the main in this article we review the procedures and recent results in using the lco method to study the consequences of the condensation of a dimension two operator in qcd in various gauges , concentrating on those aspects which relate to the renormalization group which underpins the technique .",
    "the lco method is a procedure for including low dimension operators , such as @xmath43 , in the underlying quantum field theory and determining its effective potential . in this way one can examine to what extent",
    "the operator condenses by calculating whether the energy of the true vacuum when the operator is present is less than that of the true vacuum in its absence . for qcd",
    "it turns out that it leads to a modification of the lagrangian so that new interactions are introduced which lead to an effective gluon mass .",
    "part of the justification in applying the lco method to qcd in a variety of gauges , such as the landau , curci - ferrari or mag , lies in the treatment of the two dimensional @xmath44 gross - neveu model .",
    "there the mass gap is known exactly and the lco approach obtains values for the mass gap to a few percent for a large range of @xmath45 , @xcite .",
    "we now summarise the application of the method in the case of qcd in the landau gauge .",
    "one of the advantages of this gauge is that the gauge invariant non - local operator ( [ nonlocop ] ) truncates to a single term local composite operator @xmath43 , @xcite . in this instance one couples the operator to a source @xmath46 yielding the energy functional @xmath47 $ ] @xmath48 } & = & \\int { \\cal d } [ a_\\mu \\psi \\bar{\\psi } c \\bar{c } ] \\ , \\exp \\left [   \\int d^d x \\left ( l_{\\mbox{\\footnotesize{gf } } } - \\frac{1}{2 } z_m j   a_\\mu^{a \\ , 2 } + \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\xi + \\delta \\xi ) j^2 \\right ) \\right ] ~. \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this , @xmath47 $ ] satisfies a renormalization group equation @xmath49 w[j ] ~=~ 0\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the anomalous dimension of the operator derived from the corresponding renormalization constant @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the renormalization scale introduced when one uses dimensional regularization in @xmath53  @xmath33  @xmath54  @xmath35  @xmath55 dimensions which is the regularization employed here .",
    "to ensure renormalizability one requires the additional term quadratic in @xmath46 .",
    "this is because the vacuum energy in the presence of the operator is divergent with divergences proportional to @xmath56 appearing .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath56 is defined as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the counterterm and is at present not fixed , @xcite .",
    "however , one can define a renormalization group function for the infinities associated with the @xmath56 term which are encoded in the related quantities @xmath59 and @xmath60 by @xmath61 in order to have a homogeneous renormalization group equation for @xmath47 $ ] the as yet undetermined parameter @xmath57 must satisfy @xmath62 whence @xmath63   w[j ] ~=~ 0 ~.   \\label{wrge}\\ ] ] therefore solving ( [ xidef ] ) will determine @xmath64 once @xmath50 and @xmath60 are known and this ensures that @xmath64 runs as @xmath65 runs .",
    "more importantly the homogeneity of ( [ wrge ] ) ensures that one retains an energy interpretation so that an effective action and thence an effective potential can be constructed for the operator in question , @xcite .    for practical calculations it would be more appropriate to have a functional with a linear source .",
    "this can be achieved by a hubbard - stratonovich transformation which introduces a scalar field @xmath66 via @xmath67 ^ 2 \\right)\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath68 are chosen appropriately to cancel the @xmath56 term . consequently in the landau gauge one obtains the renormalizable lagrangian for @xmath66 , and therefore the operator @xmath43 as @xmath69 once the expressions for @xmath50 and @xmath64 are known then the effective potential can be constructed .",
    "though for a two loop potential one requires the renormalization group functions at three loops .",
    "as the lco method relies on requiring explicit values of the renormalization group functions at large loop order it is important to study the renormalization of qcd in the context of the operator @xmath43 and in various gauges . for the landau gauges all the information to construct @xmath50 in fact",
    "is in place .",
    "this is due to an observation from explicit calculations and the general formalism of algebraic renormalization which demonstrate that to all orders in perturbation theory the anomalous dimension of @xmath43 is not independent , @xcite . more specifically @xmath70 in the landau gauge .",
    "this curious property is not restricted to this gauge as in the mag the anomalous dimension of the analogous dimension two operator , based on off - diagonal fields , involves the anomalous dimensions of the diagonal gluon and diagonal ghost , @xcite . in the more general curci - ferrari gauge",
    "we have observed a generalization of ( [ opstid ] ) in an explicit three loop @xmath71 renormalization , @xcite , which is @xmath72 where we note that unlike the linear covariant gauges the anomalous dimension corresponding to the renormalization of the gauge parameter , @xmath73 , is non - zero .",
    "unfortunately it has not been established whether this latter relation remains valid beyond three loops .",
    "one issue which arises when one is working with the renormalization of operators and this is the question of operator mixing .",
    "the brst invariant mass operator involves the two terms @xmath43 and @xmath74 . in principle",
    "it could be the case that the combination @xmath75  @xmath33  @xmath43  @xmath35  @xmath76 does not renormalize multiplicatively .",
    "however , in linear covariant gauges it turns out that the mixing matrix is triangular , @xcite , but not in the curci - ferrari gauge . indeed in @xcite the one loop mixing matrix for @xmath77 was determined where @xmath78  @xmath33  @xmath43 and @xmath79  @xmath33  @xmath74 .",
    "we have extended that calculation to two loops for potential future extensions of the operator product expansion analysis of @xcite .",
    "if we set @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the mixing matrix of renormalization constants . with @xmath82 then we have @xmath83 where @xmath84 @xmath33 @xmath85 , @xmath86 @xmath33 @xmath87 , @xmath88 @xmath33 @xmath89 and @xmath90 @xmath33 @xmath91 . these results were obtained by renormalizing the operators in the curci - ferrari model where there is a non - zero infrared regulating mass , by inserting them into gluon and ghost two - point functions . the curci - ferrari model has the advantage that external momenta can be nullified without introducing spurious infrared infinities as a consequence .",
    "it remains merely to extract the infinities from the resultant vacuum bubbles .",
    "not only did we reproduce the one loop matrix of kondo , @xcite , but we obtained the result that @xmath92 at two loops , thus verifying that @xmath75 is multiplicatively renormalizable at this order .    for three loop calculations the massive propagator approach is tedious and we produced an equivalent method based on the mincer algorithm , @xcite , which is implemented in the symbolic manipulation language form , @xcite .",
    "for example , one can determine @xmath58 by treating the term @xmath93 of ( [ siglag ] ) as an interaction and computing the divergence structure of the @xmath46 two - point function with massless internal fields but not internal @xmath46 propagators , @xcite .",
    "the explicit feynman diagrams are generated automatically with the qgraf package , @xcite .",
    "the mincer algorithm was especially appropriate for the three loop renormalization of qcd in the mag , @xcite , which is necessary for the construction of the two loop effective potential for the analogous dimension two brst invariant operator .",
    "unlike the linear covariant gauges the full three loop renormalization was determined only recently , @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was a significantly large computation requiring the evaluation of @xmath94 feynman diagrams compared with of the order of @xmath95 for a linear covariant gauge three loop renormalization .",
    "having detailed the renormalization group aspects underlying the lco formalism we now briefly summarize recent results of determining estimates for the gluon mass in various gauges , @xcite . first , for the landau gauge the effective potential for @xmath66 is , @xcite , @xmath118 \\frac{g^2 n_a \\sigma^{\\prime \\ , 2}}{\\pi^2 } ~+~ o(g^4 ) \\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where space has restricted us to the one loop expression and @xmath119 @xmath33 @xmath120^{-1}$ ] , @xmath121  @xmath33  @xmath122^{-1}$ ] , @xmath123  @xmath33  @xmath124^{-1}$ ] and @xmath66  @xmath33  @xmath125 .",
    "examining the solution to @xmath126 @xmath33 @xmath42 there are two possibilities which are @xmath127 @xmath33 @xmath42 or @xmath127 @xmath128 @xmath42 . for the former",
    "this is the original classical vacuum but the latter corresponds to a new vacuum which has an energy lower than the former .",
    "thus in the presence of the @xmath43 operator the effective potential produces a new vacuum which is stable unlike the now unstable ( perturbative ) classical vacuum .",
    "moreover , boundedness of the potential requires that @xmath129 $ ] needs to be positive , @xcite .",
    "interestingly this corresponds to the landau gauge one loop gluon anomalous dimension which has been suggested as part of the necessary criterion underlying confinement when that problem is considered from a renormalization group perspective , @xcite . consequently if one defines @xmath130",
    "@xmath33  @xmath131 as an effective gluon mass then for @xmath132 yang - mills @xmath133",
    "@xmath33  @xmath134 from the two loop potential @xcite .",
    "this is within @xmath135 of the one loop estimate indicating a degree of stability in the approach . as an alternative",
    "one can compute the gluon pole mass by first redefining @xmath136 in terms of the pole mass and demanding the alternative condition , @xcite , @xmath137 interestingly at one loop this produces a yang - mills mass which is independent of the renormalization scale , @xcite .",
    "though at two loops , like the effective mass of @xcite , the pole mass derived from the effective potential is scale dependent .    for the mag",
    "the analysis is not fully complete as only the one loop potential for @xmath138 has been determined , @xcite .",
    "however , the situation there is encouraging in that for pure yang - mills a mass is generated for the off - diagonal gluons which is @xmath133  @xmath33  @xmath139 .",
    "this is not dissimilar to the landau gauge @xmath138 estimate of @xmath133  @xmath33  @xmath140 .",
    "in addition the off - diagonal ghost and diagonal gluon remain massless .",
    "the appearance of the potential diagonal gluon mass operator , @xmath141 , in the lco action used for the mag , @xcite , is excluded by the diagonal @xmath142 ward identity deriving from the algebraic renormalization analysis , @xcite .",
    "we are unable to prove the renormalizability of the action supplemented with a mass term like @xmath143 .",
    "indeed overall this mass generation scenario appears to be consistent with @xmath138 lattice studies in the maximal abelian gauge , @xcite .",
    "we conclude with various observations . first , we have given an overview of the current status of the application of the local composite operator method to the condensation of a renormalizable dimension two operator in qcd in various gauges , concentrating on the underlying renormalization group aspects .",
    "one main feature is the construction of a two loop effective potential for the operator which requires knowledge of the three loop anomalous dimensions of qcd . whilst these are known for linear covariant gauges , to examine the abelian dominance hypothesis in the infrared , the more appropriate maximal abelian gauge needs to be used .",
    "this has required the full three loop renormalization of qcd in the mag , which is a significantly larger computation from the point of view of the number of feynman diagrams to be evaluated .",
    "moreover , it opens up the possibility of examining the generation of a mass for the off - diagonal gluon at the two loop level and for gauge groups other than @xmath138 .",
    "whilst this may seem to be a feature of this gauge , the issue of whether one can access abelian dominance in a covariant gauge , where the properties of the centre of the group are not explicit in the fields one uses , has recently been studied using the lco formalism , @xcite . in particular the presence of ghost condensates in @xmath138",
    "appears to be central in the dynamical generation of a mass for the off diagonal gluons which is different from that of the diagonal gluons .",
    "indeed there would appear to be evidence from a recent lattice study to support this point of view , @xcite .",
