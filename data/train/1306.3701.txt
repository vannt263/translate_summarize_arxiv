    "stellar rotation is observed to be both a strong function of mass and evolutionary state .",
    "the rotation rates of stars respond to the loss of angular momentum over time and changes to the stellar structure as objects evolve .",
    "furthermore , the fundamental structural differences between hot and cool stars , namely the presence or absence of a convective envelope , produce period distributions with a strong dependence on mass .",
    "the fact that rotation is such a sensitive function of stellar mass and evolutionary state means that it can be used as a powerful tool to understand the stars themselves .",
    "rotation is already routinely exploited as a diagnostic of stellar ages in gyrochronology @xcite , in which the strong stellar - spin down due to magnetized winds in cool ms stars is used as a clock .",
    "our focus is different : we aim to show that rotation is not only a useful diagnostic for these cool main sequence stars , but also a powerful tool for studying hot and evolved stars .",
    "on the main sequence there are two rotational regimes , distinguished by effective temperature .",
    "cool stars ( @xmath0 k ) are typically slow rotators , with periods of 10 s of days .",
    "these rotation periods are far slower than those one would expect were the star to conserve its angular momentum throughout its pre - main sequence collapse and contraction , and far slower than observed rotation periods in very young clusters ( compare the mt .",
    "wilson sample of old field stars in @xcite to @xcite for the pleiades ) .",
    "furthermore , observations of the rotation period distributions in clusters at a number of different ages have confirmed that these cool stars lose angular momentum and spin down over time ( for an extensive compilation , see * ? ? ?",
    "this angular momentum loss proceeds via magnetized stellar winds @xcite and is often parameterized using loss laws of the form @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the angular momentum loss scales strongly with the rotation velocity , which forces a convergence in the rotation periods for all objects of the same mass at late times : objects born with slow rotation rates lose angular momentum slowly , whereas those born rapidly rotating quickly spin down .",
    "therefore , even a population of cool stars born with a wide range of rotation periods will be slowly rotating with a narrow range of allowed periods at late times @xcite .",
    "it is this characteristic of the spin - down that makes gyrochronology possible : it ensures both that rotation will be a strong function of age , and that sensitivity to initial conditions for old objects will be minimal .",
    "in contrast , hot stars ( @xmath2k ) are rapidly rotating .",
    "this transition between slow and rapid rotation , known as the kraft break @xcite , occurs at roughly @xmath3 , where surface convective envelopes become vanishingly thin , and the stars are unable to generate the magnetic winds and drive angular momentum loss . as a result",
    ", these objects are rapidly rotating from birth with periods that evolve only mildly over the course of the main sequence .",
    "studies that observed stars at or beyond this boundary have confirmed this general picture @xcite .",
    "while the evolution of the rotation periods on the main sequence is driven by the presence ( or lack of ) angular momentum loss through winds , structural changes become an important contributor for evolved stars .",
    "as stars leave the main sequence their cores contract and envelopes expand , resulting in an increase in their moments of inertia . even in the most simplistic case in which the star conserves angular momentum and rotates rigidly",
    ", this increase in the moment of inertia would lead to a decrease in the surface rotation rate as the star evolves across the subgiant branch .",
    "the addition of winds on the subgiant branch allow for further spin - down .",
    "because objects above the kraft break develop convective envelopes on the subgiant branch , there can be wind - driven angular momentum loss for both main sequence rotational regimes in evolved stages .    in the era of _ kepler _ @xcite and _ corot _",
    "@xcite we will have access to thousands to tens of thousands of rotation periods ( * ? ? ?",

    "2013 , in prep . ) , all of which will be drawn from a population of stars with many different masses , ages , and evolutionary states . in order to understand the underlying stellar populations and interpret their rotation distributions ,",
    "we first need a basic set of theoretical predictions for the behavior of rotation across large regions of the hr diagram .",
    "our approach is to choose a prescription for tracking rotational evolution that minimizes our model complexity , allowing us to produce basic predictions for the rotation periods of models across a wide range of masses with minimal assumptions .",
    "we will assume that all stars rotate as solid bodies at all times , and that angular momentum is lost through magnetized winds for all objects with sufficiently thick convective envelopes .",
    "we draw our initial distribution of rotation periods ( as a function of mass ) from open clusters where the sensitivity to the somewhat complex pre - main sequence evolution is minimal .    with this set of predictions",
    "we show that the strong mass dependence of the surface rotation rate on the main sequence persists onto the subgiant branch , and provides a useful test for the mass scale in asteroseismology and means of identifying more massive stars in the crossing region . by considering evolved objects we show both that there is a strong period - age relationship among subgiant stars that has not been appreciated in the literature , and that the application of the standard gyrochronology relations must be done with some care to avoid mistaking a crossing subgiant for an unevolved dwarf and applying an inappropriate period - age relationship . additionally , the importance of the envelope expansion in determining the rotation period of stars on the subgiant branch results in a strong correlation between rotation period and radius , which will be particularly useful in the case of transiting planet hosts , in which errors on the stellar radius translate directly into errors on the planet size .",
    "finally , once we are able to compare large datasets of rotation periods to these model predictions , disagreements between our models and the data will motivate the inclusion of missing physics and additional model complexity .",
    "in section [ sec : methods ] we describe the construction of our model grid and treatment of angular momentum evolution , as well as grids to test the effects of variations on the standard physics . in section [ sec : results ] we show that our simple assumptions preserve the observed rotational properties of both cool and hot stars , and in particular that the kraft break is naturally recovered .",
    "we discuss the manner in which reasonable variations in the input physics affect our results . in section [ sec : tool ] we elucidate the many ways in which we can use stellar rotation as a tool in the context of stellar populations : as a test of the mass scale , age indicator , and constraint on stellar radii .",
    "the relationship of these new tools to the existing framework of gyrochronology is discussed .",
    "we discuss uncertainties in our models and future prospects in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in order to investigate the evolution of the surface rotation rates of a population of stars over time we must specify a reasonable set of starting conditions , here empirically motivated by data from open clusters .",
    "we also need a prescription by which we evolve these initial conditions forward in time , which includes processes such as angular momentum ( am ) loss , structural evolution , and internal am transport as a function of mass and composition . in the following section we motivate our initial conditions and prescription for am evolution .",
    "we use observed rotation periods in clusters to calibrate our am loss law to reproduce both the upper and lower envelopes of the rotation distribution .",
    "this calibration sets our starting conditions , and we apply this loss law to a grid of models to examine rotation as a function of age and mass .",
    "treatments of am evolution can be complex .",
    "we opt to construct a set of models based on the simplest set of assumptions that are consistent with the data .",
    "there are strong trends in the rotation distribution as a function of effective temperature and gravity that should exist for a variety of reasonable am evolution models .",
    "we choose the simplest case so that we can first investigate the expected range of rotation rates in a base case .",
    "stars are born with a range of initial rotation periods , and pre - ms am evolution is complex . at",
    "ages less than @xmath4 myr stars are thought to shed angular momentum through coupling with their protostellar disks .",
    "both accretion - powered stellar winds @xcite and disk - locking @xcite are possible mechanisms for the coupling , but in either case the stellar am is regulated by interaction with the disk on the timescale of the disk lifetime .",
    "the duration of this disk - locking period differs among stars , resulting in a spread in rotation rates , with rapid rotators having been released from their disks at earlier times than slow rotators . there is also evidence that the am loss law saturates for rapid rotators @xcite , and that differential rotation with depth is necessary to reproduce the young cluster data @xcite .",
    "rotational evolution on the ms is comparatively simple .",
    "cool stars below the kraft break rotate slowly , and have therefore forgotten their initial conditions by @xmath5 gyr @xcite .",
    "hot stars above the break do not lose am and the scatter in initial rotation period persists .",
    "we have little information about the internal rotation profiles of stars on the ms save that of the sun .",
    "the sun ( down to @xmath6 * ? ? ? * ) and the rapidly rotating upper envelope of open cluster stars are well approximated as a solid bodies , although uncertainties about the validity of the solid body treat remain for evolved and hot stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in cases",
    "in which there are strong internal magnetic fields , solid body rotation is the expectation @xcite .",
    "we therefore make the following simplifying assumptions .",
    "we draw our starting conditions from intermediate age open clusters ( @xmath7 gyr ) m37 , praesepe , and the hyades , supplemented with data from the pleiades ( 125 myr ) for rapid rotators .",
    "the upper and lower bounds of this period distribution give us a fair indicator of the mean and range of periods as a function of mass , which accounts for the complex pre - ms evolution without requiring that we model it .",
    "this distribution can be evolved forward under the simplifying assumption of solid body rotation on the ms for ages @xmath8 gyr .",
    "we carry the assumption of solid body rotation onto the sgb in our base model .",
    "we also make several simplifying assumptions in the stellar modeling itself .",
    "we do not construct fully rotating models .",
    "stellar parameters are tracked with underlying non - rotating models that do not include diffusion , overshoot , or the effects of rotational mixing or deformation .",
    "the evolution of the surface rotation period is tracked separately assuming a starting period and appropriate am loss law . in the following sections we detail our methods for extracting starting conditions from cluster period distributions , the form or our am loss law on the ms and sgb , and the underlying stellar models that we use to track stellar parameters .      in practice , to compile a set of rotation periods across a large mass range ( @xmath9 ) we must look to several datasets collected in fundamentally different ways .",
    "cool stars are heavily spotted , and therefore have significant spot - modulation in their light curves .",
    "dedicated photometric surveys are capable of determining rotation periods through regular observations of a set of stars .",
    "hot stars , however , generally have only a few spots , if any , and rotation rates for these stars are instead determined using rotational broadening of spectral lines , which are subject to a @xmath10 ambiguity .",
    "we are therefore forced to draw data from multiple sources to cover the entire mass range of interest .",

    "these stellar models provide the necessary information about radius , luminosity , and moment of inertia as a function of mass and age , but do not include the structural effects of rotational deformation , or account for the effects of rotational mixing .",
    "we must define a set of rules by which we evolve our starting conditions forward in time , which includes both assumptions about the internal transport of am and the loss of am via magnetized winds .",
    "we will make the assumption of efficient transport of am for all masses on the ms and sgb ; this amounts to treating all models as rigid rotators ( in both radiative and convective zones ) .",
    "we assume that there is angular momentum loss whenever the star supports a sufficiently thick convective envelope . in practice",
    "this means that cool stars are subject to magnetic braking throughout their ms lifetimes and onto the sgb .",
    "hot stars born above the kraft break have very thin convective envelopes on the ms and therefore do not spin down on the ms , but do develop winds on the sgb as their convective envelopes deepen .",
    "there are a number of prescriptions for angular momentum loss through magnetized winds in the literature .",
    "@xcite assumes that wind losses are proportional to the magnetic flux , and arrives at the functional form @xmath1 .",

    ", the @xcite loss law assumes that the loss is proportional to the magnetic field strength , and therefore derives a form of the loss law that is far more radius - dependent than kawaler - type variants .",
    "however , both formulations fail to adequately reproduce the rapid rotation of stars near the cool side of the kraft break .",
    "we adopt the @xcite magnetized wind formulation as updated in @xcite .",
    "we scale the coronal magnetic field strength and mass loss rate relative to the sun following the prescription of pinsonneault et al .",
    "2013 ( in prep .",
    ", hereafter pmm ) . to briefly summarize",
    ", the magnetic field is assumed to be linearly proportional to the rotation rate up to a saturation threshold @xmath32 , and proportional to the square root of the atmospheric pressure ( due to equipartition considerations ) .",
    "the mass loss rate is assumed proportional to @xmath33 @xcite , and we adopt @xmath34 @xcite , again up to a saturation threshold .",

    "the term @xmath41 is drawn from the @xcite prescription and sets the centrifugal correction ; it is a small correction for slowly rotating stars , and we set @xmath42 .    in practice",
    "we track the surface convective envelopes of our models only to a limiting depth , which becomes a problem for stars near the kraft break .",
    "the model fitting point between the envelope and interior can not be set at arbitrarily small masses ( and thus depths ) without inducing numerical instability , which in practice means that convective envelopes are tracked only until they pass beyond the fitting point .",
    "we have chosen a default fitting point of @xmath43 for all of our models , and assume that am loss ceases when the base of the convection zone moves beyond the fitting point .",
    "this value of the fitting point was chosen such that if we assume instead that @xmath39 is held constant ( as opposed to set to zero ) at its last value before the cz moved beyond the fitting point , that the difference between the constant and zero @xmath39 model periods would be less than one day in the periods on the ms and sgb .",
    "note that this is unimportant for low mass stars , which always have thick convective envelopes , and for high mass stars far above the kraft break , where convective zones are always negligibly thin on the ms .",
    "we must tune the parameters in our loss law to produce reasonable torques and to reproduce cluster and solar data .",
    "we consider two fits to the data : a fit to the rapidly rotating envelope , and a fit to the mostly slowly rotating stars , in order to characterize the range of reasonable rotation periods as a function of mass and time .",
    "the fits include 4 free parameters : the saturation threshold @xmath32 , the scaling factor @xmath38 , used to normalize the loss rate to reproduce the solar value , the initial disk period @xmath44 , and disk - locking timescale @xmath45 .",
    "we use the pleiades at 125 myrs , m37 at 550 myrs and the sun with a rotation rate of @xmath46 days at @xmath47 gyr as the reference datasets for the rapid rotators .",
    "we fit the most rapidly rotating sequence allowing all 4 free parameters to vary .",
    "we determine the mean rotation rates for the most rapidly rotating 10% of stars in each cluster in bins of 0.1 @xmath48 in the mass range of @xmath49 , with uncertainties on the mean determined using 1000 bootstrap resamplings ( shown as large , red points in fig .",

    "we allow only @xmath44 and @xmath45 to vary , exclude the pleiades from the fit , and limit the fit to mass above @xmath54 since slow rotators in this young cluster are affected by core - envelope decoupling , which is not accounted for in our models , and is more important for low masses @xcite .",
    "we add additional points to the fit at masses above the kraft break ( @xmath55 in steps of @xmath56 ) with rotation velocities of 50 km / s to capture the behavior of the slowly rotating a - star sequence @xcite .",
    "we infer a disk - locking timescale of @xmath57 myr and period of @xmath58 days for the slow rotators , while @xmath38 and @xmath32 are held at the values derived for the fast rotators .    for comparison , we also fit a more standard modified kawaler law @xcite : @xmath59 using the same procedure , with the same free parameters . for the modified kawaler law",

    "there are two subsets of models :    1 .",
    "we create an alternate set of models that do not lose angular momentum on the sgb .",
    "these models are allowed to lose am on the ms , but conserve am once they have passed the turnoff , defined here to be when the central hydrogen @xmath64 .",
    "we construct two grids of interiors models with different compositions : one at solar metallcity , and the other at the mean metallicity of the _ kepler _ stars , @xmath65 } = -0.2 $ ] , @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "the rotational evolution of both grids is treated in exactly the same manner : the same initial conditions are applied to both populations , and the same prescription for rotational evolution is applied .",
    "we do not account for differences in the initial rotation rates of stars as a function of metallicity , which remain observationally ambiguous .",
    "we present the results of our stellar models with rotation , and show that the chosen form of the wind law naturally reproduces the kraft break , without fine - tuning .",
    "we compare our model predictions to existing observational data both in clusters and the field .",
    "finally , in section [ subsec : isochrones ] , we present tables with our rotation predictions .",
    "we begin by considering a small subset of models , and show predictions for the total angular momentum , moments of inertia , and rotation periods as a function of time for a few representative masses in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro_panels ] under the `` fast launch '' conditions . in the second panel ( angular momentum as a function of time )",
    ", we see that more massive stars ( bluer/ greener curves ) lose very little angular momentum on the main sequence , while low mass stars ( red curves ) undergo substantial loss .",
    "high mass stars , which have no winds on the ms , develop deep surface convection zones for the first time on the sgb and begin to lose angular momentum , marked by the steep downturn in the curves of the most massive models after the main sequence turnoff .",
    "the second important ingredient in the determination of the surface rotation rate , the moment of inertia , gradually increases over the course of the ms , followed by a steep increase on the sgb as stars undergo envelope expansion . for solid body models ,",
    "an increase in the moment of inertia results directly in an increase of rotation period .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : intro_panels ] shows the results for these two effects combined : low mass objects spin down and are slowly rotating on the ms , and spin down further on the sgb .",
    "high mass objects do not lose angular momentum to stellar winds on the ms , are born rapidly rotating and remain so until they undergo expansion and wind losses on the sgb .",
    "our primary results for the full set of models are given in figure [ fig : teffvlogg_colors ] , where we show period ( encoded by color ) across many different masses and evolutionary states on a @xmath31 diagram .",
    "the diagram is populated by selecting tiles with @xmath68 and @xmath69 k , calculating the mean rotation period of all models that pass through each box in log(g)-@xmath70 , and coloring each box accordingly .",
    "the top panel shows the distribution for models evolved with fast launch conditions defined by the loss law fitted to the rapidly rotating cluster sequences .",
    "the middle panel shows the same , but for models evolved under the slow launch conditions .",
    "the bottom panel shows the simple difference in mean period , tile by tile , between the fast and slow starting conditions .",
    "the location of the kraft break is clearly visible in the top panel as the abrupt transition between red ( rapidly rotating ) and green ( intermediate rotation ) regions .",
    "one should note that the break itself is imprinted on the ms starting conditions ( denoted by the curve labeled `` launch '' ) , but persists well onto the subgiant branch , due to the differences in the angular momentum loss between stars with and without convective envelopes . in the slow launch case",
    "the same basic patterns are still present , but the contrast between the rotation rates of objects above and below the kraft break on the ms is smaller .",
    "this contrast is further diminished by the envelope expansion and wind losses on the sgb .",
    "the bottom panel illustrates an important feature : stars born below the kraft break , regardless of whether they are born rapidly or slowly rotating , have a very narrow range of predicted periods on the majority of the ms and onto the sgb .",
    "this is the result of strong @xmath1 dependence in the loss law : rapidly rotating objects are quickly spun down , whereas slowly rotating objects undergo less angular momentum loss .",
    "this forces a convergence in the rotation rates at relatively early times ( @xmath71 gyr ) , and renders the starting conditions unimportant .",
    "this insensitivity to initial conditions is one of the reasons that these cool dwarfs are suitable for gyrochronology .",
    "in contrast , the period differences between fast and slow launch conditions for objects born above the kraft break can be substantial .",
    "these objects undergo little or no angular momentum loss , and so ms scatter in the initial rotation periods is preserved well onto the sgb . in practice , this means that we expect to see a range of rotation periods for the hot stars , in comparison to the well - converged cool star sequence .",
    "figure [ fig : zamsteffplot ] presents the same models in slices through the data at particular evolutionary stages .",
    "we show period as a function of the zams @xmath70 for the starting conditions , at the terminal age ms ( tams ) and end of the subgiant branch ( base of the red giant branch , brgb ) . in this case , all models are at the same metallicity , and so @xmath70 can also be viewed as a proxy for mass .",
    "again we see that objects above the kraft break begin rapidly rotating , with periods of less than a day for the fast launch , compared to the cool stars which have more modest few - to - ten day periods . at the tams ( dotted curve in fig . [",
    "fig : zamsteffplot ] ) , the objects above the kraft break have spun down very little , while the cool stars have periods of @xmath72 days .",
    "all objects undergo significant spin down on the sgb .",
    "the rotation period increases by two orders of magnitude for the hot stars by the brgb ( dashed curve ) due the combined effects of envelope expansion and stellar winds , while cool stars undergo a similar but more modest response .",
    "the difference in the magnitude of the sgb spin down between hot and cool stars is due to two effects .",
    "first , the moment of inertia increase is far more substantial for the hot stars ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : intro_panels ] ) , and second , the hot stars develop convective envelopes while rapidly rotating ( in comparison to the cool stars , which always have convective envelopes , and are already rotating very slowly by the sgb ) , which means that the onset of stellar winds is more important for the massive stars .",
    "we compare our models to representative young and intermediate - aged open clusters in figure [ fig : clusters ] . for reference",
    "we also indicate the mass dependence that would have been predicted from an extrapolation of a rossby - scaled kawaler - style angular momentum loss law .    the upper envelope , given by the red curve in figure [ fig : clusters ] , is a fit to the @xmath73 range , and is , by construction , designed to reproduce the low - mass rapidly rotating sequences in the pleiades and m37 .",

    "winds are less effective and therefore drain less am , and the models have shorter lifetimes over which to lose am . we therefore expect that at fixed mass and age , the differences between models of different metallicity can be large .    however , if we view the impact of metallicity in terms of observables , namely @xmath79 and @xmath70 , the differences in the periods induced by composition are somewhat muted . because rotational behavior is closely linked to effective temperature , we expect that the differences between the two compositions viewed in this plane will be smaller , although not zero , due to age differences .",
    "figure [ fig : met_compare ] shows the difference in rotation period as a function of surface gravity and effective temperature between models at solar composition and those at @xmath65 } = -0.2 $ ] .",
    "we construct this diagram in a similar fashion to figure [ fig : teffvlogg_colors ] , except that each tile is now the difference between the average model period in a given @xmath31 box for a solar and @xmath65}=-0.2 $ ] grid . as expected , models with higher metallicities tend to rotate more slowly than those of lower metallicities . on average , the low metallicity models at",
    "any given location on the diagram are younger , as shown in the bottom panel of the same figure .",
    "the period differences are most severe for objects at the base of the giant branch ; at a fixed effective temperature , a more metal rich object has expanded more than a metal poor one due to metallicity dependent shifts in the location of the hayashi track .",
    "the lower ms , while unevolved , contains old objects that have had a long time to accumulate differences in their periods due to age and cz depth differences .",
    "finally , there is a discrepant patch at @xmath118 k due to the fact that the appearance of hooks in the stellar tracks ( due to convective cores ) is shifted to lower temperatures at higher metallicities , and the morphology of these hooks affects the exact pattern of am loss , since objects effectively cross from one side of the kraft break to the other and back over the course of their evolution through the hook . in this region one",
    "is comparing stars that do and do not undergo evolution through a hook , and therefore have different rotation periods .",
    "we have considered reasonable distributions of rotation periods for single stars on the ms , and quantified a reasonable range in period .",
    "we have , not , however , accounted for several classes of astrophysical background sources that will inevitably be present in large datasets of rotation periods :    1",
    ".   synchronized binaries : tidally synchronized binary systems will have rotation periods less than 10 days , and they are relatively common .",
    "@xcite , for example , found binaries with periods less than 10 days to be @xmath119 of the sample in the field , compared with 11% in the hyades .",
    "these objects will contaminate the rapidly rotating sample .",
    "rv variability or sed information from photometry should permit us to quantify and distinguish this population from massive single stars .",
    "stellar mergers : the rotation rates of mergers are not radically distinct from those of other massive stars ( see for example * ? ? ? * for the old open cluster ngc 188 ) . for low mass stars , however , mergers could produce unusually rapid rotation for stars of the same mass and age .",
    "@xcite estimated that @xmath120 of sub - turnoff stars in old open clusters could be merger products , and such stars would rotate more rapidly on average than single stars .",
    "a comparable fraction of halo dwarfs are severely over - depleted in li @xcite , which is consistent with this estimate .",
    "li abundances , for some mass ranges , should allow us to discriminate between normal and blue straggler stars .",
    "3 .   slowly rotating massive stars :",
    "there are two mechanisms that can produce slow rotation in massive stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a good discussion ) .",
    "a sub - population of stars have very high magnetic fields @xcite , which leads to very slow surface rotation .",
    "these stars have peculiar spectra caused by element segregation in their outer layers @xcite .",
    "tidally synchronized binaries will also rotate unusually slowly .",
    "such stars also are subject to unusual surface abundance patterns and are typically referred to as am stars @xcite .",
    "both phenomena appear at surface rotation rates below 90 - 120 km / s .",
    "stars with an angular momentum history different from that in our models will therefore be reasonably common in massive stars .",
    "@xcite find that @xmath121 of the overall population of a0-a1 stars fall under one category or another .",
    "the frequency of chemically peculiar stars rises into the early f domain .",
    "the most likely explanation is not a mass dependent trend in frequency , but instead the onset of slower surface rotation , which in turn induces unusual surface abundances .",
    "each of these classes of objects represents both a background and an opportunity : while they will contaminate any large sample of rotation periods and make interpretation of those periods more challenging , we may also be able to use their unusual rotation rates to identify them as interesting subsets of objects for further study .",
    "we have neglected several physical effects in our models that could be important if we intend to utilize stellar rotation as a precise diagnostic of stellar parameters .",
    "apart from the uncertainties in the modeling of the am loss and evolution that we have already discussed , we have also neglected the effects of stellar rotation on the structure itself , and considered models with no diffusion , both of which may be important for stars at and above the kraft break .",
    "rotation reduces the effective gravity of the star , and rotating stars have lower effective temperatures and luminosities than non - rotating stars of the same mass and composition . for a @xmath122 model run in yrec s fully rotating configuration , with solid body rotation and no wind losses and a zams rotation velocity of @xmath123 km / s , the corrections to the effective temperature and gravity at the ms turnoff are within @xmath124 k throughout the ms and sgb , with @xmath125 on the ms , @xmath126 on the sgb .",
    "rotation has substantially weaker effects on the structures of low mass stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "these effects will need to be taken into account before the mapping between temperature and mass is trustworthy , but the general trends that we focus on throughout this paper regarding mass , evolutionary state , and period should remain qualitatively unchanged .",
    "diffusion and gravitational settling are another class of physical effects that we have neglected in our treatment that may induce uncertainty into relationships between @xmath70 , @xmath79 , age , and rotation period .",
    "diffusion has the effect of deepening the convection zone and shortening the lifetime of a model with respect to the no diffusion case , both of which , as we have shown for metallicity , affect the predicted rotation period .",
    "in section [ sec : tool ] we discussed the many ways in which rotation can be used as a tool to understand stellar populations . in this section",
    "we discuss additional applications of rotation rates that may represent interesting tools in the near future .",
    "measurements of rotation period could serve as useful diagnostics in the context of asteroseismology .",
    "there are two primary diagnostics of the global oscillation pattern in asteroseismology can provide information on the mass and radius of the star .",
    "the frequency of maximum power , @xmath127 , is the location of the peak ( in power ) of the envelope of oscillation modes .",
    "the large frequency separation , @xmath128 , is the spacing in frequency between modes of same degree and consecutive radial order .",
    "together , measurements of these quantities in conjunction with the scaling relations @xcite : @xmath129    @xmath130    provide a measure of the mass and radius .",
    "these scaling relations are very general , model independent , and an extremely useful tool for determining stellar parameters .",
    "it is , however , important that they be verified .",
    "interferometric measurements of stellar radii have helped to confirm the validity of the scaling in radius ( see * ? ? ? * for example ) , but there have been limited tests of the seismic mass scale ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "because of the nature of the sharp transition between slow and rapid rotation as a function of mass , even on the subgiant branch , measurements of rotation period could provide a means to verify stellar masses derived via the scaling relations .",
    "we have presented here a set of very simple physical models : we consider only solid body rotation and am losses from winds , both of which are well motivated by observations .",
    "our previous discussion of the uses of rotation as a tool relies on the assumption that our models are correct . while our simple case is well motivated ,",
    "there are more complicated effects , such as differential rotation , that could also be important , and we may find that our theoretical predictions do not agree with the data and motivate additional model complexity .    if we were to consider the addition of differential rotation , for example , we might consider 1 ) models that have internal differential rotation on the ms , and rapidly rotating cores on the sgb , 2 ) models that begin as solid bodies on the ms but develop internal differential rotation in radiative zones over the course of the sgb , or 3 ) models that allow for differentially rotating convective zones as well radiative zones .",
    "each of these combinations would produce a different signature in the surface rotation rates of stars evolving on the sgb , and a pattern of departures from the simple , first - order case we have presented here .",
    "case 1 ) would result in objects with faster rotation rates than we predict , as the base of the convective envelop dredges up material from deeper , more rapidly rotating regions of the star as the object evolves across the subgiant branch .",
    "in contrast , case 3 ) , coupled with wind losses , could produce rotation periods longer than those of the solid body case , because surface layers depleted of am would not be quickly resupplied with am from the deeper interior .",
    "case 2 ) is among the simplest to address in a more qualitative way .",
    "we evolve a solid body model in yrec s fully rotating configuration of a 1.6 @xmath131 star to the msto .",
    "the model is then allowed to develop differential rotation as it undergoes core contraction and envelope expansion on the sgb .",
    "radiative zones are assumed to conserve specific angular momentum , while convective zones always rotate as solid bodies .",
    "we neglect winds both on the ms and sgb for this exercise .",
    "models of this form rotate a maximum of about 1.2 times more slowly ( at @xmath132 k ) than a solid body model evolved under yrec s fully rotating configuration ( which accounts for rotational deformation , unlike our standard models ) .",
    "this period difference is the result of a larger effective reservoir of am available in the solid body case .",
    "there am transport is assumed to be instantaneous , and therefore and am that would otherwise be sequestered in the core is redistributed throughout the star immediately . in the case of the differentially rotating model ,",
    "only the angular momentum of the outermost envelope is available , and thus we would observe a slower rotation rate . as the convective envelope deepens in both models the differences in the rotation rates",
    "decrease , because limited am is located in the core of even the differentially rotating case , and both models have large envelopes rotating as solid bodies .",
    "there are many other possibilities suitable for investigation that are beyond the scope of this paper . in the absence of large rotation datasets",
    "it has been impossible to determine which of these cases is most correct , and it is difficult to motivate the inclusion of additional model complexity . with enough observational data , it will be possible test more complex interiors models by recognizing the pattern of departures between the data and a simple set of models , such as those that we have provided in this paper .",
    "we have begun here with a very simple test case ; as large datasets inform our theory , we may find that we are finally well motivated to include more complicated physics in our models .",
    "measurements of rotation are highly complementary to the precise stellar parameters that will be obtained by the gaia mission .",
    "luminosities derived through parallaxes suffer from a mass - composition degeneracy , which means that although the object may be well - placed on a hr - diagram , fundamental parameters such as age and mass remain uncertain . furthermore , luminosity in sensitive to helium , which unlike metal content , is not easily measured .",
    "as we have shown , rotation is also sensitive to composition , but its dependence is different : luminosity is set by the mean molecular weight , where rotation is set by the effective temperature and age of the star .",
    "the addition of rotation information can break the mass - composition degeneracy .",
    "rotation also remains a means to identify unusual objects , such as stellar mergers and interacting systems , that fall in otherwise typical regions of the hr diagram but have unusual rotation periods ( e.g. subturnoff mergers , see * ? ? ?",
    "gaia will be able to identify likely binaries based on their hr diagram locations with respect to the single star ms , but rotation will be able to determine the fraction of those binaries that have synchronized .",
    "massive binaries will appear as anomalously slowly rotating , whereas low mass binaries will have inflated rotation rates .",
    "our predictions for typical rotation periods , coupled with observations and the precise hr diagram locations provided by gaia , allow for interesting studies of binary evolution by isolating both pre- and post - merger objects .",
    "photometric rotation information from gaia itself will be limited @xcite , and the periods of solar analogs largely misidentified .",
    "however , @xcite suggests that for rapidly rotating objects with @xmath133 days , the information from the satellite photometry alone may be adequate to identify the period , meaning that massive stars or synchronized binaries may have measured rotation periods . for broader populations , large - scale spot - modulation or rotation velocity surveys will be necessary to take full advantage of the constraining power of stellar rotation rates",
    "massive and precise datasets produced by spacecraft such as _ kepler _ and _ corot _ are transforming stellar and planetary astrophysics . unlocking the full potential of these rich datasets",
    "requires the ability to sort through the complicated mixture of stars observed in field studies . as always , the challenge of sample characterization is to find an observable that varies strongly as a function of the parameters we wish to infer , and to exploit it .",
    "rotation represents such an observable .",
    "historically , it has been impractical to measure rotation in bulk field samples , but modern surveys will yield rotation periods for an unprecedented number of stars , making rotation a viable and useful tool .",
    "rotation periods are shaped by stellar mass , age , and evolutionary state .",
    "a transition from rapid rotation at high mass to slower rotation at lower mass ( the kraft break ) is imprinted on the ms and linked to the onset of am loss from magnetized winds in the cool stars .",
    "such winds progressively spin down cool stars as they age .",
    "as stars evolve , their moments of inertia also change , resulting in substantial changes in their surface rotation periods .",
    "mass , age , and evolutionary state are therefore imprinted on the measured surface rotation rates .",
    "we are already accustomed to using rotation as an age diagnostic in gyrochronology , but when we expand our studies beyond the realm of traditional gyrochronology and consider a mixed field population of both evolved and unevolved stars at many different masses , rotation can be used as a tool for a far broader set of investigations .",
    "it can provide constraints on stellar mass , evolutionary state , and radius in addition to its use as an age diagnostic , and becomes particularly useful on the subgiant branch , where these quantities can be otherwise difficult to obtain .",
    "these qualities make period measurements immediately useful for characterization of the hosts of transiting planets , where precision stellar radii are essential , and for the verification of the asteroseismic mass scale .      1 .    @xmath95 days : young solar - like _ or _ massive stars born above the kraft break 2 .",
    "@xmath72 days : ms solar - like stars or crossing massive and intermediate mass subgiants .",
    "@xmath97 days : primarily solar/ low - mass subgiants    a star s period , in combination with an effective temperature , therefore immediately makes suggestions regarding its birth mass and current evolutionary state . these regimes also demonstrate that the presence of subgiants will be an important consideration when dealing with large , mixed stellar samples .",
    "subgiants are numerous in magnitude - limited surveys , and represent an important background in the prime period range for gyrochronology ( 10 - 40 days ) . for effective temperatures in the range @xmath134",
    "k , a survey with a magnitude limit of @xmath103 will consist of roughly 35% subgiants . the fraction in bright ,",
    "seismically interesting samples ( @xmath108 ) is even higher , at @xmath135 . any conclusions regarding the age distributions of a field sample determined through gyrochronology that do not account for presence of subgiants will be erroneous .",
    "it is essential that the contribution of subgiants to period distributions be recognized : they are paradoxically both an important contaminant and a population of stars for which stellar parameters are highly accessible through measurements of their rotation periods .",
    "we have presented here a set of predictions for the most simplistic physically motivated model of the evolution of the surface rotation rate , based on the existing rotation data . a sample of bright _ kepler _",
    "stars with both measured rotation periods and seismic information will be available in the near future , and the exquisite precision of the data will provide powerful tests of these predictions that were not possible in the past . during the preparation of this manuscript ,",
    "several large samples of rotation period have become available @xcite .",
    "although beyond the scope of this paper , our next step is to compare these datasets with our theoretical predictions . the reality of stellar rotation may be far more complex than our simple model : it may be that stars leave the ms with substantial internal differential rotation .",
    "this would result in anomalously high observed rotation rates on the sgb as the convective envelope eats into the rapidly rotating interior of such a star .",
    "likewise , it may be the case that the convective envelopes of these evolved stars support substantial differential rotation ( as opposed to the theoretical expectation of solid body rotation ) .",
    "while the signature of this differential rotation would be present on the sgb as anomalously slow rotation , it could be confused with other effects , such as unexpectedly efficient winds , which could complicate the interpretation .",
    "we can however , examine the surface rotation rates giants after first dredge up ; these objects would be sufficiently slowly rotating that winds should not be important , and the presence of differential rotation in the convective envelope could be more clearly identified . in this way ,",
    "comparison of large datasets to our simple theoretical model will inform us as to whether or not additional complexity is needed to explain the observed distribution of rotation periods across the hr diagram , and we will then be able to motivate the inclusion of additional physics with observations .",
    "we stand to learn as much from disagreements between data and models as perfect agreement .",
    "once we have made these initial comparisons and refinements using small but excellent rotation datasets , rotation - based diagnostics will continue to be useful beyond the era of _ kepler _ and _ corot _ , and even in the presence of precise parallaxes ( e.g. gaia ) .",
    "rotation depends on mass and composition in a fundamentally different manner than luminosity , which will help to break degeneracies between mass and metallicity that will exist even with exceptional parallax measurements . for large time - domain surveys",
    "in which parallaxes or extensive spectroscopic follow - up is unavailable , rotation remains a means to differentiate between dwarf and subgiant , evolved and unevolved , low - mass and high - mass stars .",
