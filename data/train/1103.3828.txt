    "one of the most evident manifestations of the dark matter existence is the detection of huge invisible halos ( with density profiles @xmath4 ) surrounding galaxies @xcite .",
    "our galaxy also has such a halo .",
    "we symbolize the orbital radius of the solar system , the average velocity of the galaxy rotation , and the escape velocity at this radius by @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "we also denote the radial and tangential components of a dark matter particle velocity by @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "velocity distribution of the dark matter particles ( hereafter dmps ) inside the halo is poorly known ; it is usually supposed to be maxwell with a cut - off when @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 we accept @xmath12  kpc , @xmath13  km / s , @xmath14  km / s .",
    "@xmath15 is a normalizing constant , and for the chosen parameters @xmath16 .",
    "it is worthy of noting that @xmath17 remains almost constant throughout the halo .",
    "distribution ( [ 11b1 ] ) faces with difficulties .",
    "in fact , in the framework of collisionless dynamics it can be naturally obtained from profile @xmath4 , subject to the condition , however , that function @xmath18 is isotropic , i.e. @xmath18 depends only on @xmath19 ( so called isothermal model ) .",
    "this assumption seems highly improbable .",
    "indeed , if ( [ 11b1 ] ) is true , the majority of the dark matter particles has large specific angular momentum @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "the average angular momentum of the particles ( and , consequently , of the halo ) is zero .",
    "however , the root - mean - square momentum is @xmath21 at @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , since in this model @xmath22 and @xmath17 is constant in the halo if @xmath4 , the root - mean - square angular momentum reaches an incredibly huge value @xmath23 at the edge of the halo ( @xmath24  kpc ) .",
    "meanwhile , according to modern cosmological conceptions , not only the total angular momentum of the halo but also the momentum of each particle should have been negligibly small on the linear stage of the structure formation @xcite .",
    "the halo could gain some angular momentum later , as a result of tidal perturbations or merging of smaller halos ; numerical simulations show , however , that it can not be large @xcite .",
    "some results of stellar dynamics are frequently used in order to show that the dark matter particles could gain a large angular momentum during the galaxy evolution .",
    "the parallels between dmp and stellar dynamics , however , are not universally true .",
    "the point is that stars are compact objects , and their gravitational field can be strong , at least , locally . on the contrary ,",
    "the small - scale gravitational field of the dark matter is always small @xcite .",
    "therefore important relaxation mechanisms of stellar systems like close pair approaches or an interaction with the interstellar medium are completely ineffective for dmps .",
    "so called violent relaxation @xcite is perhaps the only way to impart significant angular momentum to the dark matter particles .",
    "however , it acts also on the halo stars ; moreover , its efficiency decreases with radius , and it should stronger affect the star distribution since the stellar halo is more compact .    to summarize : all halo objects",
    "initially had @xmath25 and later gained some angular momentum because of various processes like relaxation or tidal effects .",
    "all the mechanisms increased @xmath26 of the halo stars , at least , as much as of the dmps , while some mechanisms affected only the stars , and not the dmps .",
    "consequently , velocity distribution of the oldest stellar halo population should be closer to the maxwellian one , than the distribution of the dark matter particles .",
    "in particular , the tangential velocity dispersion @xmath27 of the dmps can not be larger than that of the halo stars at the same radius .",
    "modern observations of the oldest halo stars  subdwarfs  confirm the above reasoning @xcite .",
    "their tangential dispersion @xmath28  km / s , which corresponds to @xmath29 , is two times lower than in ( [ 11b1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the distribution widely differs from the maxwellian : @xmath30 is much larger than @xmath27 .",
    "consequently , @xmath27 of the dark matter particles on the outskirts of the solar system does not exceed @xmath31  km / s and can be even smaller .",
    "second , the observations show that the halo stars have not yet relaxed and their orbits are rather prolate . on the other hand , if distribution ( [ 11b1 ] ) is correct , the ellipticity of the majority of dmp orbits is small , and then the dark matter is the only class of halo objects that move almost circularly .",
    "it seems much more natural to assume the opposite , and we come to the premises we use throughout this article :    \\1 ) the specific angular momentum @xmath32 of , at least , the main part of the particles is fairly small , and their orbits are rather prolate ( below we will express this supposition quantitatively ) .",
    "\\2 ) the galactic halo is stationary and spherically symmetrical .",
    "the latter supposition is not quite accurate : a part of dark matter can form a so - called thick disk @xcite , moreover , the influence of the star disk also takes place .",
    "however , our assumption is quite acceptable for an estimative consideration .",
    "\\3 ) in accordance with observations @xcite , we assume that the density profile of the galaxy is @xmath33 up to some large enough radius @xmath34 .",
    "the profile can not be valid for an arbitrary large @xmath35 , since in the opposite case the halo mass would be infinite .",
    "starting from some radius ( we denote it by @xmath34 ) , the halo density drops much faster .",
    "as we will see , this is the main parameter defining the dmp velocity distribution . the profile @xmath36 has an another demerit : the predicted annihilation signal ( which is proportional to @xmath37 ) diverges when @xmath38 .",
    "however , as it will be shown below , the velocity distribution of dmps on the outskirts of the solar system weakly depends on the density profile inside the solar orbit .",
    "therefore we will not discuss a very complex question of the dark matter profile near the galactic centre .",
    "\\4 ) we assume that the dark matter mass outside of the radius @xmath34 is negligibly small as compared with the total halo mass .",
    "this supposition is the most discussable ; however , there are strong arguments in favour of it .",
    "first , experimental data show @xcite that @xmath36 up to very large distances .",
    "second , in order that the total halo mass is finite , the density must fall much faster than @xmath39 ( at least , faster than @xmath40 ) at large distances .",
    "for instance , one of the most popular einasto profile predicts an exponential density decreasing @xcite .",
    "third , the outer regions of the halo are respectively weakly bound in the gravitational field and can easily be torn away by tidal effects .",
    "these four suppositions turn out to be sufficient to derive the velocity distribution more or less unambiguously .",
    "all our calculations are , of course , focused on determination of the dmp velocity distribution on the outskirts of the solar system .",
    "for our galaxy we accept @xmath41  kpc , which corresponds to the total mass of the galaxy @xmath42 .",
    "the module of gravitational potential on the edge of the halo is equal @xmath43 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath44 . since @xmath4",
    ", the mass inside some radius can be found as @xmath45 , gravitational field is equal @xmath46 , and we obtain the gravitational potential inside the halo : @xmath47 let us start our consideration from the case when the dmps have no angular momentum at all .",
    "then their trajectories are radial ( @xmath48 ) , and the task becomes one - dimensional .",
    "therefore the particle distribution in the halo can be entirely described by a single function @xmath49 , so that @xmath50 gives the total mass of dark matter in the element of phase space @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 differs from the standard distribution function only by a insignificant multiplier  the dmp mass @xmath53 .",
    "since we suppose that the dark matter particles are propelled only by the gravitational force , @xmath53 is not important for us , the calculations are formally valid even for the dark matter consisting of primordial black holes , and such a definition of @xmath52 allows us to avoid of the undesirable dependence on the dmp mass .",
    "the halo density is bound with the function @xmath52 by a trivial relation @xmath54 here we introduced a more convenient variable @xmath55 instead of @xmath56 , @xmath57 if @xmath4 . in our case @xmath58 , and we obtain a determining condition on @xmath52 : @xmath59 each dark matter particle executes a radial oscillation around the galactic centre .",
    "we denote by @xmath60 the maximum distance it moves off the centre .",
    "its velocity in potential ( [ 11a2 ] ) is equal to @xmath61 and we obtain useful equations : @xmath62 here @xmath63 is the time required for the particle to fall from @xmath60 to the centre .",
    "we introduce a distribution function @xmath64 of the particles throughout parameter @xmath60 , so that @xmath65 is the total mass of dmps which apoapsis lies in the interval @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "the r - coordinate of these particles varies between @xmath67 and @xmath60 , and they give a yield into the halo density over all this interval .",
    "indeed , the fraction of time the dmps from the subsystem under consideration pass in an interval @xmath68 $ ] is equal to @xmath69 .",
    "since the total particle mass of the subsystem is @xmath65 , the contribution to the halo mass in interval @xmath70 is equal to @xmath71 velocity interval @xmath72 that is covered by the particles of the subsystem at radius @xmath35 is @xmath73 . substituting this to ( [ 11a8 ] ) and taking into account that @xmath74 , we obtain the general equation for @xmath49 : @xmath75 now we substitute here equations ( [ 11a5 ] ) and ( [ 11a7 ] ) : @xmath76   \\label{11a10}\\ ] ] we can easily find function @xmath64 if we suppose that the halo boundary is sharp , i.e. the density obeys the law @xmath4 up to radius @xmath34 and is equal to zero just after it . then the maximum velocity the halo particles may have at radius @xmath35 is @xmath77 it is a matter of direct verification to prove that function @xmath78 satisfies condition ( [ 11a4 ] ) .",
    "this function has a peculiarity at @xmath79 .",
    "so the main part of dmps comes to us from the very edge of the halo .",
    "the distribution function is @xmath80 where @xmath81 is defined by ( [ 11a11 ] ) , @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "the distribution through the radial velocity @xmath83 can be easily obtained from ( [ 11a12 ] ) : @xmath84 , where @xmath85 $ ] .",
    "normalized velocity distribution on the outskirts of the solar system is equal to @xmath86 the distribution has a peculiarity at @xmath87  km / s , which is a result of the supposition that the density after @xmath88 immediately drops to zero .",
    "in actuality there is a characteristic length @xmath89 of density decreasing out of @xmath34 , for instance , if the decreasing is exponential @xmath90 we can use @xmath91 as @xmath89 .",
    "then the cusp at @xmath81 transforms into a smooth peak .",
    "since the free fall acceleration at @xmath88 is @xmath92 , we can easily estimate the width of the peak : @xmath93 near the solar system @xmath94  km / s .",
    "it is natural to assume that @xmath95 ( actually , it follows from supposition 4 in the _ introduction _ ) , so the distribution is still very narrow .    to illustrate the above reasoning ,",
    "let us consider the following density profile : @xmath96 in this case , we can not determine the distribution @xmath97 analytically .",
    "however , if @xmath98 , we can neglect the change in the gravitational field on the scale of @xmath91 and then find an approximate solution .",
    "[ fig1 ] represents distributions ( [ 11b2 ] ) ( for the sharp halo edge , solid line ) and for density profile ( [ 11g1 ] ) ( dotted line , we accepted @xmath99  kpc ) .",
    "one can see that in the case of smoothed halo edge the peculiarity at @xmath100  km / s is transformed into a smooth peak , which is , however , quite narrow , and the general shape of the distribution remains the same .",
    "we will discuss the influence of the halo density profile on the velocity distribution in the beginning of the _ discussion _ section .",
    "the angular momentum of the dark matter particles hardly can be exactly equal to zero .",
    "if a particle possesses some specific momentum @xmath32 , its velocity in gravitational field ( [ 11a2 ] ) is equal to : @xmath101 since ( [ 11b3 ] ) is distinct from ( [ 11a5 ] ) , distribution ( [ 11a6 ] ) , strictly speaking , is not valid anymore .",
    "however , we may use it if the difference between ( [ 11b3 ] ) and ( [ 11a5 ] ) is small .",
    "mathematically it can be written as : @xmath102 as we have already discussed in the _ introduction _ , specific angular momentum of the majority of the dark matter particles hardly can be larger than @xmath103 . substituting @xmath79 , @xmath104 to the inequality",
    ", we can see that its right part is equal to @xmath105 , while its left part is @xmath106 .",
    "hence the inequality asserts near the solar system , the influence of the angular momentum on the radial dynamics is still negligible for the majority of dmps , and we can use ( [ 11a6 ] ) up to @xmath107 as before .",
    "thus the dmp distribution throughout @xmath8 in this approximation coincides with ( [ 11b2 ] ) .",
    "however , the particles have also some distribution throughout @xmath108 .",
    "for simplicity we will suppose that @xmath109 where @xmath31  km / s , though the distribution can be much narrower .",
    "then the normalized dmp distribution near the solar system can be closely approximated by @xmath110 where @xmath111 $ ] , @xmath112  km / s .",
    "distribution ( [ 11b6 ] ) is strongly anisotropic and actually describes two colliding beams of particles .",
    "fig .  [ fig1 ] represents distributions ( [ 11b2 ] ) and ( [ 11b1 ] ) ( solid and dashed lines , respectively ) .",
    "one can see that ( [ 11b2 ] ) is much narrower and has much higher average velocity .",
    "the physical reason of it is obvious : in the case of maxwell distribution ( [ 11b1 ] ) the particles move almost circularly , which is why only a few of dmps from the edge of the halo reach the solar orbit . on the contrary , in the case considered in this article the majority of dmps comes from the halo edge and",
    "thus are much more accelerated by the gravitational field .",
    "consequently , the question of what of the distributions , ( [ 11b1 ] ) or ( [ 11b2 ] ) , is correct , can be reduced to whether the particles from the halo edge can reach the solar orbit or not .",
    "in addition to the arguments presented in the _ introduction _ we note that , according to ( [ 11b3 ] ) , a particle falling from @xmath88 should have a specific angular momentum @xmath113 , lest the particle can reach @xmath114  kpc .",
    "this value is huge , it far exceed not only the characteristic momentum of halo objects , but even the momentum of the disk , and thus looks very unlikely .",
    "so particles from the edge of the halo freely reach the earth , and their spectrum should be closer to ( [ 11b2 ] ) .",
    "a similar consideration allows us to examine the dependence of velocity distribution ( [ 11b2 ] ) on the density profile .",
    "our assumption of the existence of a large region with @xmath33 is approximately correct for massive spiral galaxies , such as the milky - way @xcite .",
    "however , we obtained ( [ 11b2 ] ) on the additional assumption that the edge of the halo is more or less sharp .",
    "meanwhile , the outer region of the halo can have a density profile steeper than @xmath39 , but not steep enough to be considered as a cutoff .",
    "as an instance , one can consider a double power - law halo @xcite .",
    "how can it influence on the velocity profile ?",
    "the answer depends on the mass fraction of this steeper region with respect to the total mass of the halo .",
    "if the fraction is small , the distribution differs little from ( [ 11b2 ] ) , as we demonstrated with distribution ( [ 11g1 ] ) .",
    "let us consider the case when the fraction is significant .",
    "we indicate the radius where the profile gets steeper than @xmath39 by @xmath115 ; hereafter we will name outer halo the region out of @xmath115 . as we could see , in the model with sharp halo edge the majority of the particles comes from the edge of the halo . expressing this fact mathematically , distribution @xmath116 is small for @xmath117 and goes to infinity at the edge of the halo ( [ 11a6 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to show that in the case of the presence of a massive outer halo dark matter particles mainly come from it , and the fraction of the particles with @xmath118 is respectively small .",
    "let us consider a system of particles with @xmath119 . according to ( [ 11a8 ] ) , their contribution to the halo mass in interval @xmath70 depends on @xmath35 only as @xmath120 .",
    "@xmath120 , however , changes rather slowly inside the region where @xmath33 , since the potential there ( see ( [ 11a2 ] ) ) depends on @xmath35 only logarithmically . therefore ,",
    "the particles falling from the edge of halo provide almost the same contribution to the halo mass on each radius inside the region @xmath121 , which corresponds to @xmath122 .",
    "function @xmath116 should be chosen so that it reproduces the density profile , in particular , it should provide @xmath33 .",
    "however , as we could see , the particles from the outer halo by themselves give a very similar profile , and we need relatively few of particles with @xmath118 in order to make it exactly @xmath39 .",
    "consequently , @xmath116 is small for @xmath118 , and a significant fraction still comes from the halo edge .",
    "thus , this property of the distribution does not depend on the exact density profile , being only a result of the assumption of strong anisotropy of the velocity distribution and of the flatness of potential ( [ 11a2 ] ) .",
    "function @xmath116 unambiguously determines the velocity distribution of the dark matter particles , and the above - mentioned common properties of @xmath116 directly correspond to characteristics of @xmath123 . for the milky way galaxy @xmath115",
    "is large ( @xmath124  kpc , @xcite ) , which corresponds to @xmath125  km / s for a terrestrial observer . below this speed the distribution as a whole is similar to ( [ 11b2 ] ) , and it does not depend much on the density profile of the outer halo , since it is created by the particles with @xmath118 . on the contrary , the distribution in region @xmath126  km / s strongly depends on the density distribution on the edge of the halo and can differ drastically from ( [ 11b2 ] ) .",
    "however , now we can estimate what distribution @xmath123 looks like if profile @xmath33 is valid only up to @xmath127  kpc , and then the halo has a massive outer region , for instance , a navarro - frank - white tail .",
    "we can expect that @xmath123 is similar to ( [ 11b2 ] ) below @xmath128  km / s and is totaly defined by the density profile of the outer halo for @xmath129  km / s . since the outer halo is rather extensive , we can expect that a cusp in ( [ 11b2 ] ) is strongly smoothed , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] illustrates all these properties , though we made rather a small modification of the density profile ( [ 11g1 ] ) .",
    "so the main characteristic features of distribution ( [ 11b2 ] ) are not sensitive to the density profile : the distribution is completely not maxwell , a significant fraction of particles comes from the edge of the halo forming a high - velocity bump in @xmath123 .",
    "the difference between ( [ 11b1 ] ) and ( [ 11b2 ] ) is important for various aspects of the dark matter physics . in the case of direct dark matter",
    "search the signal , roughly speaking , can be represented as a product of a part depending almost not at all on the dmp distribution and an integral @xcite @xmath130 here @xmath131 is the minimal dmp speed , to which the detector is sensitive , @xmath132 is the distribution in the earth s frame of reference , obtained from ( [ 11b1 ] ) or ( [ 11b2 ] ) by a galilean transformation ( see details in @xcite , section 3.3 ) . because of the earth s orbital motion @xmath133 varies with a year period , and it is this variation that is observed in the direct detection experiments . fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the ratio between the double amplitudes @xmath134 of direct detection signals calculated for anisotropic distribution ( [ 11b6 ] ) and maxwell distribution ( [ 11b1 ] ) , as a function of @xmath131 .",
    "one can see a very significant difference .",
    "the difference between distributions ( [ 11b1 ] ) and ( [ 11b2 ] ) can also be important for the indirect dark matter search .",
    "neutrino observations , for instance , are trying to detect the dark matter annihilation going on in the centre of the sun .",
    "the signal depends on the number of the dmps captured by the sun .",
    "very roughly speaking , it is proportional to @xmath135 .",
    "one can see that for distribution ( [ 11b2 ] ) @xmath135 is approximately @xmath136 times smaller than for the conventional maxwell distribution ( [ 11b1 ] ) .",
    "if the @xmath137-channel of the dark matter annihilation dominates ( which is typical ) , @xmath138 , and the signal is not sensitive to dmp distribution . however , if the @xmath139-channel prevails , @xmath140 , and the signal is proportional to the averaged velocity of the particle collision . @xmath141 in the case of distribution ( [ 11b2 ] ) and @xmath142 in the case of maxwell distribution ( [ 11b1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath81 relates to @xmath17 by ( [ 11a11 ] ) , and one can see that @xmath143 predicted by anisotropic distribution ( [ 11b2 ] ) is much lower at the halo edge and much higher in the central region than the maxwell one . near the solar system , however , they are nearly equal .",
    "finally , sommerfeld effect is inversely proportional to @xmath143 , and if it plays any role in the dark matter annihilation , it is also sensitive to the particle distribution .",
    "we wish to thank g. b ' elanger for a very valuable help in this work ."
