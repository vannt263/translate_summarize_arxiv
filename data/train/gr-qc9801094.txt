    "our current understanding of the formation of structures in the universe rests on the remarkable evolution of vacuum fluctuations during the inflationary phase . while stretched by the rapid expansion from microscopic to astronomical scales , these fluctuations supposedly decohere , and start to behave as ( the source of ) classical density perturbations .    to date , several physical pictures and formalisms have been put forward as a means to understand this quantum to classical transition.@xmath7 most authors approached the problem within the general framework of decoherence of a subsystem coupled to the environment .",
    "two early applications of this idea to density perturbations in inflationary cosmology are those of sakagami @xcite , and brandenberger et al .",
    "@xcite . unruh and zurek",
    "@xcite examined the classical transition in the case of a scalar field coupled to a thermal bath .",
    "the general criteria for decoherence and the study of cosmological perturbations in the squeezed state formalism were given by albrecht et al .",
    "hu and calzetta @xcite introduced the technique of a closed time path for evaluating the decoherence functional , and studied in depth the mutual influence of particle production , dissipation , and decoherence .",
    "the same method was applied to the problem of density perturbations by hu et al .",
    "other related works are those of calzetta and mazzitelli @xcite , who considered decoherence due to particle production , calzetta and hu @xcite who studied the decoherence of a mean field by its quantum fluctuations , and calzetta and gonorazky @xcite , who investigated fluctuations in a model with non - linear coupling .",
    "a phenomenological model for the decoherence of density perturbations was constructed by kubotani et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another category of decoherence studies in inflationary cosmology starts with the pioneering work of guth and pi @xcite , who showed that at late times the wave functions for long - wavelength modes behave as classical gaussian probability distributions . around the same time",
    "lyth @xcite pointed out that the wave packet for massless modes in de sitter space does not spread , and the quantum uncertainty becomes negligible .",
    "more recently , polarski and starobinsky @xcite and lesgurges et al .",
    "@xcite examined particle production in de sitter space and found a strong squeezing of long wavelength modes which makes their behavior essentially classical . in all of these cases one",
    "looks at the free fields , and the classical evolution emerges due to a particular property of the de sitter background .",
    "polarski and starobinsky @xcite call this decoherence without decoherence,@xmath7 to stress that classical features may emerge even in the absence of an interaction which is deemed essential in usual decoherence studies .    a similar but complementary line of reasoning emerges within the stochastic approach to inflation @xcite which dramatically exhibits the influence of quantum fluctuations on semiclassical evolution .",
    "starobinsky @xcite already pointed out the negligible canonical commutator of long wavelength modes .",
    "nambu @xcite constructed a statistical operator for the coarse - grained field , and argued that its evolution is effectively classical . in a different picture , ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the random walk of a highly peaked wave function for a coarse - grained field , in accord with the langevin equation .",
    "finally , matacz @xcite constructed a new formulation of stochastic inflation and investigated the resulting semiclassical evolution .",
    "all these different physical pictures provide much welcomed complementary insights into the problem , and often have vastly different powers in explaining slightly modified or more general situations . some differences in the results and interpretations should not be overemphasized at this time .",
    "we are still in the phase of collecting new evidence through studies of different models , and testing of various decoherence criteria and their comparison .    in this spirit",
    ", i will aprroach here the decoherence of vacuum fluctuations in de sitter space using the most traditional technique of quantum field theory in curved spacetime : particle production in an expanding universe @xcite .",
    "one elementarty criteria for the semiclassical behavior is to look at the magnitude of the particle occupation number . when this number is large , the canonical coordinate and momentum operators approximately commute , and the system behaves semiclassicaly . our goal here is to investigate the decoherence of vacuum fluctuations in de sitter space according to this criteria .",
    "our basic model consists of fluctuations of a massive scalar field",
    ". we will establish how decoherence depends on the mass or conformal coupling of the scalar field .",
    "calculations of particle production usually deal with comparing the particle number at asymptotically early and late times , or with respect to vacuum states defined in two different frames . in the de sitter case ,",
    "the calculation of the latter kind has been done by lapedes @xcite who in this way rederived the existence of a thermal bath seen by an observer in the static frame @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a different quantity is calculated here : the time dependent , one - mode occupation number in a spatially flat , expanding frame .",
    "this will allows us to follow the eventual buildup of ( quasi)particle occupation number in the course of the cosmological expansion .",
    "the method to do so is not new , but apparently it has not been applied before to the de sitter case .",
    "the probable reason is that since the pioneering works in ref .",
    "@xcite most efforts concerning fluctuations in inflationary cosmology have been to compute the spectrum and the evolution of density perturbations in various models , and to confront these results with the observational constraints on the microwave background anisotropy and large scale structure .",
    "the classical nature of fluctuations is usually assumed , or argued for in passing , by invoking gibbons - hawking radiation @xcite , or the horizon in de sitter space .",
    "we will return to these and other arguments at the end of this paper .",
    "for now , our main goal is to consider the simplest of all inflationary scenarios , that of a massive field on a true de sitter background , and to study the conditions under which vacuum fluctuations in this model evolve into classical fluctuations .",
    "the essence of the method is given in sec .",
    "ii , and its specification to the de sitter case in sec .",

    "the explicit form of the spatial modes depends on the geometry of the three - dimensional space . in either case",
    "the field amplitudes are those for a set of harmonic oscillators with time dependent frequencies :    @xmath15    with @xmath16    since , for a free field , the modes decouple and each of them may be considered separately , from now on we can drop the subscript @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath18 denotes the canonical momentum of a mode @xmath19 we may define the one - mode creation and annihilation operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 :    @xmath22    @xmath23    these definitions agree with the standard ones when the frequency is real , and the potential is upright .",
    "this assures that we will have the same initial vacuum states and particle excitations as in the textbook cases . when the frequency is imaginary , and the potential upside - down , the presence of @xmath24 rather than @xmath25 assures that @xmath20 and @xmath21 obey the creation / annihilation algebra , and that the particle number still makes sense in that regime .",
    "one should be aware though that when the frequency is imaginary , the hamiltonian of the excitations is nothing like @xmath26 .",
    "this is the price that we have to pay for having the sensible definition of creation and annihilation operators for an upside - down oscillator , and a sign of the very different physics in this case .",
    "we can now define the one - mode number operator @xmath27 .",
    "its rate of change , for our case , is found to be    @xmath28    the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ dn ] ) describe the two sources of particle production : the possible upside - down shape of the potential , and the possible change in curvature of the potential , either upside - down or upright , with time .",
    "in particular , if the initial state is the fock vacuum with @xmath29 , a finite value may develop in time .    in most of the cases that have been considered before @xcite only the second term contributes . in some of them",
    "the rate of change of frequency is small , and the particle number may still be defined as an adiabatic invariant . however ,",
    "if the frequency is imaginary , there will be some particle production due to the first term , and the adiabatic invariance of the particle number will not apply .",
    "it will be seen in a moment how this works in the de sitter case .    although eq .",
    "( [ dn ] ) provides a good illustration of what is going on , it does not offer an easy way to calculate the time evolution of the number operator . for this i will use the method of ref.@xcite , with a slight generalization to cover the case of the upside - down potential .",
    "let @xmath30 and @xmath31 be the initial conditions at some @xmath32 , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the two independent solutions of the oscillator equation ( [ osceq ] ) .",
    "the general solution may be written as    @xmath35    with time dependent coefficients @xmath36",
    "@xmath37 @xmath38    using @xmath39 and @xmath40 one can calculate the off - diagonal bogoliubov coefficient @xmath41 :    @xmath42    the one - mode occupation number is then given as    @xmath43    where @xmath44 refers to the fock vacuum at the initial time @xmath32 .",
    "this is the main quantity we are interested in .",
    "if the occupation number is large , we have that @xmath45 $ ] , so , to a high accuracy @xmath20 and @xmath21 commute , @xmath19 and @xmath18 also approximately commute , and the behavior of the mode is essentially classical .",
    "this elementary criteria for classicality has been used before in the schroedinger picture by guth and pi @xcite .",
    "another schroedinger picture criteria , developed by lyth @xcite , will be discussed in the appendix .",
    "note that the canonical commutator has the same form for any choice of creation and annihilation operators , so the above criteria for classicality is immune to the usual ambiguity of defining particles in curved spacetime .",
    "the particle production in this case leads to the formation of a classical condensate , and quantum fluctuations are effectively decohered .",
    "we would like to know what the conditions for this to happen in de sitter space are so that such decohered quantum fluctuations may serve as the source of classical density perturbations in inflationary cosmology .",
    "for spatially flat de sitter expansion the scale factor evolves as @xmath47 , with @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . introducing a new independent variable @xmath50 ,",
    "the one - mode frequency ( [ omega ] ) becomes    @xmath51    the modes themselves are well known :    @xmath52    @xmath53 are hankel functions , and @xmath54 .",
    "these modes are normalized so that @xmath55 at all times . the minus sign in the definition of variable @xmath56 is to avoid complications due to the branch cut of hankel functions on the negative real axis .",
    "thus , the flow of time is from large to small values of @xmath56 . at early times , when @xmath57 , the modes reduce to plane waves    @xmath58    the expression for the off - diagonal bogoliubov coefficient is now simplified ,    @xmath59 + \\frac { 1}{2 |\\omega|^{1/2 } } [ a^{\\prime}(z ) + i b^{\\prime}(z ) ] ~~,\\ ] ]    and a straightforward calculation leads to our final expression for the number of particles produced in course of the expansion    @xmath60    this expression does not depend on the initial moment @xmath61 , but it correctly reproduces the initial vacuum condition @xmath62 in the limit @xmath63 .",
    "however , it is the opposite regime , @xmath64 , the regime of large expansion , that is of most interest , as at that time the wavelength of the mode exceeds the hubble radius .",
    "this is one way that inflation solves the horizon problem .    the behavior of frequency eq .",
    "( [ omegads ] ) in this regime may be seen from fig .",
    "there are two cases : real frequency and bounded classical motion for @xmath65 , and imaginary frequency and rolling down the hill @xmath7 for @xmath66 .",
    "the first term in eq . ( [ dn ] ) affects the particle number at @xmath67 only for @xmath66 , and is absent for larger masses .",
    "the moment when these effects turns on is about or after the moment at which the fluctuation crosses the hubble radius .",
    "the frequency vanishes at @xmath68 .",
    "compared to the moment of crossing the hubble radius , the two scale factors are related as    @xmath69    the scalar field which drives inflation is supposed to have a very low mass , @xmath70 , and in that case , and up to a mass as large as @xmath1 , the one - mode frequency turns imaginary just before the mode crosses the hubble radius .",
    "however , for @xmath71 , the rolling down the hill@xmath7is postponed to later times , well after the physical wavelength of the mode equals the hubble radius . either way , it is the evolution at @xmath72 that decides the fate of the fluctuation .",
    "the other source of change in the particle number is the variation of frequency with time .",
    "this is given as    @xmath73    figure  [ fig2 ] shows the behavior of this function for several characteristic values of @xmath74 .",
    "the universal growth as @xmath75 is due to the accelerating expansion of the de sitter universe .",
    "for all values of mass the rate of change of frequency exceeds unity very soon after the mode crosses the hubble radius .",
    "thus , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ dn ] ) gives the major contribution to the change in particle number at @xmath72 for all values of mass .",
    "there is another regime with a large frequency change in the @xmath66 case , near point @xmath76 where the frequency vanishes .",
    "this period lasts just an e - fold of expansion or so , before the rate of change in frequency drops close to unity and then starts to grow with @xmath64 . in this case",
    "we have a shrinking size of the phase space cell , rather than its large occupancy , so the expected spike in particle number should be considered as a spurious effect .",

    "in fact , for intermediate mass fields , case ( d ) above , this is the only source of decoherence .    another curiosity has to do with the kinematic argument that rapid expansion leads to the accumulation of modes with low , and almost indistinguishable frequencies .",
    "this infrared divergence@xmath7 supposedly leads to a large occupation number for long - wavelength modes , hence to their highly classical behavior .",
    "this is a puzzling argument , since it does not depend on the mass of the field , so one would expect the formation of a classical condensate in all cases .",
    "the answer is that while the occupation number in the massless case indeed looks as if it can be understood by a kinematic argument @xmath169 for a finite mass the exponent is smaller , and precludes kinematic interpretation .",
    "the decoherence argument which is often considered to be the most trustworthy is the demonstration of the effectively diagonal form of the reduced density matrix obtained by tracing out some uninteresting degree(s ) of freedom other than inflaton field .",
    "this general scheme appears to be the most satisfactory approach to the classic measurement problem@xmath7 in quantum mechanics , and its application to the creation of density perturbations in inflationary cosmology has been investigated by several authors , e.g. , brandenberger _",
    "@xcite , sakagami @xcite , and hu _ et al .",
    "a common conclusion to all these approaches is that the decoherence is proportional to the strength of the coupling , and it is supposed to disappear if the coupling goes to zero .",
    "the analysis of free models done here shows that in the de sitter background there will be some decoherence which does not depend on the magnitude of the coupling constant .",
    "the interaction or self - interaction may be sufficient but not a necessary condition for the decoherence .",
    "a similar conclusion may be reached by utilizing the stochastic approach of starobinsky @xcite for the analysis of long - wavelength quantum fluctuations in an inflationary universe @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a plausible physical argument for the decoherence of quantum fluctuations in an inflationary universe was pointed out by lyth . @xcite he considered a massless , minimally coupled scalar field , initially in the state of minimal uncertainty .",
    "subsequently , the wave function of this time - dependent oscillator will spread . by treating this",
    "spread approximately as in the case of a free particle in flat spacetime , lyth was able to show that times taken for the width to reach values that are large compared to the initial spread are themselves quite large compared to the hubble time . due to technical restrictions",
    "the argument applies only for a period of a few hubble times after the fluctuation crosses the hubble radius , but , as lyth remarked , it seems plausible [ ... ] that if the wave packet is already extremely classical when this stage is reached , it will remain so for 60 or so hubble times that the field survives .",
    "indeed , this argument is quite robust , and for a massless case it is equivalent to the criteria used here . to see this , recall that lyth uses the field amplitude before rescalling @xmath170 . in the massless case , @xmath171 is given by eq .",
    "( [ masslesschi ] ) , so we have        at late times , @xmath171 diverges , while @xmath8 freezes . the latter property has often been used in early studies as a heuristic argument for the scale invariant nature of fluctuations in an inflationary universe .",
    "the expectation value for the heisenberg operator @xmath173 will also approach a constant . in the schroedinger picture",
    "this property translates into the freezing out of the width for the one - mode wave function .",
    "therefore , the rolling down the hill@xmath7 in the @xmath19 representation , which is responsible for the growth of the particle number , is equivalent in the massless case to the lyth s criteria ( in @xmath8 representation ) of a wave packet which does not spread appreciably .",
    "the two criteria for classical behavior are in agreement .",
