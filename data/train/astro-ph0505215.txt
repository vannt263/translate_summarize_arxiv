    "quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) have been observed in many low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "they give important clues to understand disk structures as well as to evaluate the mass and spin of the central neutron stars or black holes .",
    "although the mechanism of the qpos is still under debate , recent observations suggest that they can be attributed to disk oscillations .",
    "observations further suggest that some resonant processes are involved in the mechanism of the qpos , and many disk oscillation models in this direction have been proposed since abramowicz and kluzniak ( 2001 ) , e.g. , lamb and miller ( 2003 ) and kluzniak et al .",
    "in previous papers ( kato 2003 , 2004a , 2004b ) we have proposed that the qpos are disk oscillations excited on a warped disk by a resonant process .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine how much the warp model is compatible with observations .",
    "we consider a relativistic warped disk . on the disk we superpose disk oscillations .",
    "then , some of these disk oscillations have resonant interactions with the disk at particular radii through non - linear coupling with the warp ( kato 2003 , 2004a , 2004b )",
    ". when the warp has no precession ( this is the case considered in the above papers ) the resonances occur at radii where one of the relations of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath2 is satisfied , where @xmath3 is the epicyclic frequency and @xmath4 is the angular frequency of disk rotation , @xmath5 being the radius from the disk center . in the case of relativistic keplerian disks , these radii are , in turn , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ( kato 2003 , 2004a ) , where @xmath9 is the schwarzschild radius , defined by @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the mass of the central object .",
    "kato ( 2004b ) subsequently showed that among the resonant oscillations mentioned above , those at @xmath1 are excited spontaneously by the resonance process , itself .",
    "kato ( 2004b ) further showed that the high - frequency qpos in black - hole x - ray binaries , which are usually a pair and have a frequency ratio close to 2 : 3 , can be explained by this warped model .    in this paper",
    "we extend the warped disk model to the case where the warp has precession .",
    "we demonstrate that by this extension the main important characteristics of qpos in x - ray binaries ( neutron - star and black - hole x - ray binaries ) can be qualitatively explained . among three types of resonances , which tend , in the limit of no precession , to @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath2 ,",
    "we focus our attention in this paper on the middle one , since the resonances in this case spontaneously excite oscillations , as mentioned above .",
    "details of the resonance process on warped disks are presented by kato ( 2003 , 2004a , 2004b ) in the case where the warp has no precession .",
    "the essence of the resonance processes is the same , even when a warp has precession .",
    "we thus present here only an outline .",
    "an overview of our non - linear resonance model in the case where the warp has precession is sketched in figure 1 of kato ( 2004c ) .",
    "we consider geometrically thin disks rotating with angular velocity @xmath4 . the epicyclic frequency on the disk is denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "the oscillations on geometrically thin disks are generally classified into g - mode and p - mode oscillations ( see , e.g. , kato et al . 1998 ; kato 2001 ) .",
    "in simplified disks the oscillations are further classified by the set of ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , where @xmath15(0 , 1 , 2 ... ) is the number of nodes in the azimuthal direction , and @xmath16(0 , 1 , 2 ... ) is a number related to nodes in the vertical direction .",
    "that is , @xmath14 represents the number of nodes that @xmath17 ( the radial component of velocity associated with oscillations ) has in the vertical direction .",
    "it is noted , however , that @xmath18 ( the vertical component of velocity associated with oscillations ) has ( @xmath19 ) nodes in the vertical direction , and @xmath20 in the case of @xmath21 .",
    "a warp is a global deformation of disks with @xmath22 .",
    "the warp is assumed to have a precession whose angular frequency is @xmath23 , on a disk deformed by the warp we superpose g - mode oscillations with arbitrary @xmath13 and @xmath14 . a g - mode oscillation with frequency @xmath24 and ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) has a relatively large amplitude , global pattern only around the radius where @xmath25 is satisfied .",
    "this can be understood if the dispersion relation for local perturbations is considered ( e.g. , kato et al . 1998 ; kato 2001 ) .",
    "that is , the region of @xmath26 is a evanescent region of the oscillations . in the region where @xmath27 is smaller than @xmath28 , on the other hand , the oscillations have very short wavelengths in the radial direction in geometrically thin disks .",
    "a non - linear interaction of this g - mode oscillation with the warp produces an oscillation with @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( these oscillations are called hereafter intermediate oscillations ) .",
    "these intermediate oscillations resonantly interact with the disk at the radius where the dispersion relation for these intermediate oscillations is satisfied [ see kato ( 2004b ) for detailed discussions ] .",
    "there are two types of resonances .",
    "one is resonances that occur through motions in the vertical direction , and the other is those through motions in the radial direction ( see kato 2004a , referred to paper i ) . here , we are interested in resonances in the horizontal direction .",
    "the horizontal resonances occur around the radius where @xmath34 is satisfied . combining equations ( [ 1.1 ] ) and ( [ 1.2 ] ) , we find that the resonances occur at the radius of @xmath35 ( cf .",
    "paper i ) .",
    "after this resonance the intermediate oscillations feedback to the original oscillations , amplifying or dampening the original oscillations ( kato 2004b ) .",
    "hereafter , we consider the case of @xmath36 .",
    "a detailed examination shows that when @xmath30 of the intermediate oscillation is @xmath37 , i.e. , @xmath38 , the oscillations that resonantly interact with the disk at @xmath12 are those satisfying @xmath39 at the resonant radius . on the other hand ,",
    "the oscillations that resonantly interact with the disk at @xmath12 are those satisfying @xmath40 there , when @xmath41 ( see paper i ) .    here , we consider non - axisymmetric oscillations . among them",
    "we are particularly interested in oscillations of a small number of @xmath13 .",
    "typical ones are @xmath42 ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) , @xmath45 ( @xmath43 , @xmath46 ) , and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) . as shown below , we identify these oscillations , in turn , to the horizontal branch qpos , upper - frequency khz qops , and lower - frequency khz qpos in the case of z sources . considering this",
    ", we introduce the following notations : @xmath50",
    "we consider a relativistic keplerian disk with the schwarzschild metric , and examine the radii where the resonance condition , @xmath12 , is satisfied as functions of @xmath23 .",
    "the condition is satisfied at two different radii when @xmath51 .",
    "( in the case of @xmath52 , we have only one radius , i.e. , @xmath53 .",
    "the other one is @xmath54 . ) as @xmath23 increases , the inner radius becomes larger than @xmath53 , while the other one decreases from infinity . at a certain critical value of @xmath23 ,",
    "both radii coincide and above the critical value of @xmath23 , there is no solution of @xmath12 .",
    "the results are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the unit of the abscissa is @xmath55 .",
    "the critical value of @xmath23 is @xmath56 hz when @xmath57 , while @xmath58 hz when @xmath59 .",
    "the branch of larger value of @xmath5 on the @xmath5@xmath23 plane is hereafter called the upper branch and that of the lower one the lower branch . the frequencies ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) at radii of the lower branch decrease as @xmath23 increases , since the resonance radius moves outward . on the other hand , the frequencies at radii of the upper branch increase as @xmath23 increases . to compare with observations , the @xmath61@xmath60 , @xmath62@xmath60 and @xmath23@xmath60 relations",
    "are shown in figure 2 , which is free from precession . for a comparison , the straight line of the @xmath60@xmath60 relation is also added .",
    "values of @xmath55 are shown , for convenience , at some points on the @xmath23@xmath60 curve .. the trancated curve on the upper - right corner is the first harmonic of @xmath62 , i.e. , it represents the @xmath63@xmath60 relation .",
    "the curve extends to the left , but is cutted in order to avoid complexity of the figure .",
    "it is useful to compare this figure with figure 2.9 of van der klis ( 2004 ) .",
    "we take the standpoint that the variation of the precession is the cause of time variations of qpo frequencies in a single object .    as the precession frequency changes , the frequencies @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 vary along the curves in figure 2 .",
    "observations show that the changes of the horizontal branch qpos and lower - frequency khz qpos are correlated so that the former frequencies are @xmath64 0.08-times the latter ones ( psaltis et al .",
    "hence , for a comparison , the curve of the @xmath65@xmath60 relation is shown in figure 2 .",
    "figure 2 shows that the curve of the @xmath65@xmath60 relation crosses the curve of the @xmath62@xmath60 relation at @xmath66 hz , which corresponds to @xmath67 hz .",
    "it is noted that the curves shown in figure 2 are mass - independent , since the axes are normalized by @xmath68 .",
    "that is , the results hold in a wide range of frequency by changing the mass .",
    "in luminous neutron - star low - mass x - ray binaries ( the z sources ) , we typically have four distinct types of qpos .",
    "these are the @xmath6920 hz normal branch oscillation ( nbo ) , the 1560 hz horizontal branch oscillation ( hbo ) , and the @xmath701200 hz kilohertz qpos that typically occur in pairs .",
    "the qpos in the atoll sources ( less luminous neutron - star low - mass x - ray binaries ) can also be classified into similar types of oscillations .",
    "in addition , in the atoll sources the hectohertz qpos are observed in the frequency range of 100 hz200 hz . in the z sources ,",
    "however , the presence of hectohertz qpos is uncertain , or ambiguous . in black - hole x - ray binaries",
    ", we have high - frequency qpos in the range of 100 hz to 450 hz , which usually appear in pairs .",
    "a comprehensive review on qpos is presented by van der klis ( 2004 ) .",
    "one of important characteristics of qpos in the z sources is the presence of a strong correlation between kilohertz qpos and hbos .",
    "that is , the frequency of the lower khz qpo and that of hbo are correlated in each object so that the former is @xmath71-times the latter .",
    "this correlation extends from neutron - star to black - hole x - ray binaries in nearly three orders of magnitude in frequency ( psaltis et al .",
    "1999 , see figure 2 of their paper ) . in our resonance model this correlation can be explained if variation of precession frequency occurs around 115@xmath72 hz , say , @xmath73 hz @xmath64 @xmath74 hz .",
    "a question is whether such a precession has been observed . in relation to this issue , it it interesting to note that the observed hectohertz qpos are roughly in the frequency range mentioned above .",
    "this suggests that the hectohertz qpos might be a manifestation of the warp .",
    "one of the characteristics of the hectohertz qpos is that their frequencies are nearly constant ( e.g. , van der klis 2004 ) . in our resonance model ,",
    "the relation of @xmath75 is realized over in a wide range of @xmath60 without much changing the value of @xmath23 , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the warp represents the hectohertz qpos .",
    "the precession of disks in x - ray binaries is theoretically expected , since the radiation force from central star gives torques on warped disks ( pringle 1996 ; maloney et al . 1996 ) .",
    "it is not clear , however , whether such a high - frequency precession as required here is generally expected .",
    "we suppose that the frequency of the precession is related to rotation of the central star .",
    "a non - axisymmetric pattern on a rotating stellar surface will give rise to a precession of the disk through the effects of a radiative force or a magnetic field .",
    "another important characteristic of qpos in neutron - star x - ray binaries is that the frequency ratio of the pair khz qpos is close to 3 : 2 , but changes with time so that the ratio decreases with an increase of the frequency .",
    "this observational trend is realized in our model . in our model",
    "the ratio @xmath76 is 1.5 at @xmath77 hz , and becomes larger than 1.5 for smaller @xmath60 . for larger @xmath60",
    "the ratio tends to unity as the resonant radii approaches to @xmath78 @xmath9 ( i.e. , @xmath52 ) .",
    "next , let us consider black - hole x - ray binaries .",
    "the pair of high - frequency qpos in these objects changes little their frequencies , keeping the ratio close to 3 : 2 .",
    "this is different from the case of neutron - star x - ray binaries .",
    "our resonance model qualitatively explains this .",
    "considering their mass and the observed frequencies of qpos , we think that in the case of black - hole x - ray binaries the observed qpos are those resulting from the lower branch of the @xmath5@xmath23 relation ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "that is , the resonance radius is close to 4.0 @xmath9 .",
    "this case corresponds to the upper - right corner of figure 2 . in the limit of @xmath52 ,",
    "the resonance occurs at @xmath79 and the frequency ratio of @xmath61 and the first harmonic of @xmath62 is just 3 : 2 .",
    "( it is noted that the first harmonic of @xmath62 has been also observed in the z sources . )",
    "these qpos change little their frequencies for a change of precession frequency , since as shown in figure 1 the resonance radius remains close to @xmath53 for a large change of @xmath23 .",
    "another explanation of little change of frequencies of high - frequency qpos in black - hole binaries is that the precession is really small in the case of black holes , since the radiation force from the central object is absent .",
    "it is noted that in our model the modes of the pair qpos in the black - hole binaries are different from those in neutron - star binaries .",
    "that is , the pairs in the former are @xmath80 and @xmath63 , while those in the latter are @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we have restricted our attention only to the resonances at @xmath12 , since the analyses of growth rate of resonant oscillations suggest that the resonances at @xmath81 and @xmath82 are not spontaneously excited ( kato 2004b ) .",
    "however , examinations of these cases are worthwhile . as an example",
    ", some results in the case of @xmath81 are shown in figure 3 . for simplicity , in this figure ,",
    "only the resonant oscillations resulting from the upper branch of the @xmath5@xmath23 curve are shown .",
    "the frequency of precession required to obtain @xmath75 is around 50@xmath72 hz100@xmath72 hz .",
    "our model predicts that some qpos that are not yet observed are present in neutron - star and black - hole x - ray binaries . in our model",
    "the observed qpos in neutron - star x - ray binaries are the resonance oscillations at resonant radii belonging to the upper branch of the @xmath5@xmath23 diagram ( figure 1 ) .",
    "resonances coming from a resonance radius of the lower branch are also expected .",
    "they have higher frequencies compared with the observed ones . the observed qpos in black - hole x - ray binaries , on the other hand ,",
    "are interpreted to be resonant oscillations belonging to the lower branch of the @xmath5@xmath23 relation .",
    "resonant oscillations resulting from radii of the upper branch are also expected .",
    "these oscillations have lower frequencies compared with the observed ones .      in the present paper",
    "we have considered horizontal resonances of g - mode oscillations . in this model ,",
    "the precession required is retrograde .",
    "furthermore , time variation of the precession is required in order to explain time variation of qpo frequencies . in the case of vertical resonances of g - mode oscillations , however , the observed qpo frequencies and their time variations can be explained as a result of time change of disk structure in the vertical direction , without appealing to precession .",
    "this is discussed in a subsequent paper ."
