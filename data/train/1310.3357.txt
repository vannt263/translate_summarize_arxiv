    "the resolution of systems of algebraic equations with symmetry groups appears in the mathematical treatment of many models , @xcite .",
    "these groups consist of transformations that map solutions of the algebraic system into other solutions .",
    "some consequences of the existence of such symmetry groups , from an analytical point of view , have been described in e.  g. @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is discussing the influence of the symmetries in the numerical procedures to approximate the solutions of the system .",
    "this is surely a question that is more or less implicitly observed but , to our knowledge , not formally discussed , except in particular cases , @xcite .",
    "the study is focused on fixed - point iteration algorithms .    from this numerical setting ,",
    "two main points of discussion emerge . on the one hand ,",
    "the formation of the corresponding orbits by the group is an obstacle to assume local uniqueness for the solutions of the system .",
    "( this is necessary for some classical local convergence results . ) on the other hand , the symmetry group incorporates a zero eigenvalue in the jacobian of the system at the solution , which implies the existence of the eigenvalue one in the iteration matrix of the corresponding iteration operator if a fixed - point system is considered .",
    "this property prevents the application of many results of convergence , @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the following points of the paper are emphasized :    * because of the existence of a symmetry group in the system of algebraic equations , the solutions can not be isolated , since any transformed solution by the symmetry group is also a solution .",
    "therefore , this property forces to talk in terms of orbits of solutions ( or orbits of fixed points in the case of a fixed - point system ) instead of isolated solutions . via this symmetry group and the corresponding partition of the space into orbits",
    ", the system of equations is associated to a reduced system , whose solutions consist of the orbits of the solutions of the original one . *",
    "several points of influence of the symmetry group on the iterative resolution of the system are analyzed .",
    "it is first shown that the infinitesimal generators of the group at any solution are eigenvectors of the corresponding jacobian of the system , associated to the zero eigenvalue .",
    "( when the system is of fixed - point type , the infinitesimal generators are eigenvectors associated to the eigenvalue equals one of the corresponding iteration matrix . ) when the associated eigenspace is spanned by these infinitesimal generators , the jacobian can be interpreted in terms of the jacobian of the reduced system at the corresponding orbit .",
    "the rest of the spectrum is preserved by the symmetry group action . + the main consequence , in the numerical resolution , is the concept of orbital convergence .",
    "this means local convergence to some element of the orbit of a solution of the system , that is , convergence modulo symmetries of the group .",
    "the iterative algorithms are analyzed in the reduced space for the orbit solutions of the reduced system , leading to the derivation of classical convergence results but in the orbital sense .",
    "the limit point may be estimated , in a first approximation , by the component of the initial iterate in the eigenspace associated to the eigenvalue equals one of the iteration matrix of the fixed - point iteration function .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec:1 ] the definition of a symmetry group of a system of algebraic equations , along with several related concepts , are reminded .",
    "the orbit of a point by the group , the infinitesimal generators and the reduced system by the symmetries are emphasized .",
    "some properties of the spectrum of the jacobian matrix of the system at a solution are described ; in particular , the existence of the zero eigenvalue because of the symmetry group and the structure of the associated eigenspace .",
    "this information is used in section [ sec:2 ] , where fixed - point iterations for the numerical resolution of this kind of systems are analyzed .",
    "( now , the zero eigenvalue becomes one for the iteration matrix of the corresponding iteration function .",
    "the reduction by symmetries preserves the rest of the spectrum of the iteration matrix . )",
    "thus , from the introduction of the concept of orbital convergence , classical results , like the contraction mapping theorem , can be stated in an orbital sense .",
    "the limit point is an element of the orbit of the fixed point and section [ sec:2 ] is finished off with some remarks about the structure of the error and estimates on this limit point .",
    "finally section [ sec:3 ] is devoted to some numerical illustrations .",
    "two examples are considered .",
    "the first system appears in the modelization of an @xmath0-body problem and involves a one - parameter symmetry group of rotations .",
    "the second example concerns the numerical generation of traveling waves in nonlinear dispersive wave equations and takes the bona - smith system of boussinesq equations as a case study .",
    "for details related to the definitions and properties mentioned in this section , see e.  g. @xcite . throughout this paper",
    ", @xmath1 will stand for a domain in @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath4 will denote a @xmath5-parameter ( @xmath6 ) lie group of transformations @xmath7 acting on @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath4 is assumed to satisfy the following conditions :    * @xmath4 is abelian , connected and global .",
    "* @xmath4 acts regularly on @xmath1 .",
    "the second property in ( a1 ) means that @xmath4 is connected when its structure of manifold is considered and excludes discrete groups in our study . on the other hand",
    ", the global action implies that each element @xmath8 is a diffeomorphism on @xmath1 .",
    "finally , it is said that @xmath4 acts regularly if the associated orbits @xmath9 are of the same dimension and for each @xmath10 one can find a neighborhood @xmath11 such that each orbit intersects @xmath11 in a pathwise connected subset .",
    "this property and the global action imply that the orbits ( [ na2 ] ) are regular @xmath5 dimensional submanifolds of @xmath1 .",
    "the infinitesimal generators of ( [ na1 ] ) play a relevant role in the present paper .",
    "they are the vector fields @xmath12 and provide a local representation of the group , in the sense that the flow associated to each vector field ( [ na3 ] ) is a one - parameter symmetry group and any element of ( [ na1 ] ) is locally a composition of these transformations . note that under the previous hypotheses on @xmath4 , for each @xmath10 , the vectors @xmath13 are linearly independent and since @xmath4 is abelian , these one - parameter subgroups commute .",
    "finally the action of ( [ na1 ] ) can generate the quotient space @xmath14 .",
    "this consists of identifying points that belong to the same orbit and consequently its elements are orbits in the original manifold @xmath1 .",
    "the hypotheses assumed on @xmath4 imply that the quotient space @xmath14 is a ( @xmath15 ) dimensional manifold .",
    "considered now are systems of algebraic equations on @xmath1 on the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is assumed to be @xmath18 on @xmath1 . in the sequel ,",
    "an equivalent fixed point system @xmath19 for some @xmath18 iteration function @xmath20 , will also be considered .",
    "the equivalence between ( [ na4 ] ) and ( [ na5 ] ) is understood in the sense that @xmath21 is a solution of ( [ na4 ] ) if and only if @xmath22 is a fixed point of ( [ na5 ] ) , that is , @xmath23 the group ( [ na1 ] ) is said to be a symmetry group of ( [ na4 ] ) if each element @xmath24 has the property of transforming solutions of ( [ na4 ] ) into solutions , that is , @xcite @xmath25 equivalently , the symmetry group condition for ( [ na5 ] ) is @xmath26      the presence of the symmetry group ( [ na1 ] ) has some consequences in the structure of ( [ na4 ] ) that are relevant for our analysis .",
    "note first that differentiating ( [ na6 ] ) with respect to @xmath27 and evaluating at @xmath28 we obtain that if @xmath22 is a solution of ( [ na4 ] ) then @xmath29 where @xmath30 stands for the jacobian of @xmath31 at @xmath22 and the @xmath32 are given by ( [ na3 ] ) .",
    "this means that @xmath30 is singular and the vectors @xmath33 belong to @xmath34 .",
    "equivalently , using ( [ na7 ] ) , the iteration matrix @xmath35 , corresponding to the fixed point system ( [ na5 ] ) , admits @xmath36 as eigenvalue with the @xmath33 as eigenvectors .",
    "the second consequence concerns the way the systems ( [ na4 ] ) , ( [ na5 ] ) can be reduced in the quotient space @xmath14 .",
    "this can be described by using local coordinates , @xcite .",
    "the hypotheses ( a1 ) , ( a2 ) allow to construct , in some neighborhood @xmath37 of @xmath22 , a system of local coordinates @xmath38 for which the group @xmath4 corresponds to translations in the first @xmath5 variables , @xmath39 this implies that , locally , the infinitesimal generators are the first @xmath5 vectors of the canonical basis in @xmath2 , @xmath40 where @xmath41 has all the components equals zero except the one in the @xmath42-th position , which values one .",
    "note then that the symmetry group condition implies that close to @xmath43 , the system ( [ na4 ] ) is independent of the first @xmath5 variables ( @xmath44 ) and can be written in the form @xmath45 such that the first @xmath5 equations in ( [ na9 ] ) are functionally dependent on the remaining ones .",
    "this implies a reduction of the first @xmath5 variables and the characterization of ( [ na4 ] ) in terms of the @xmath15 variables @xmath46 and the last @xmath15 functionally independent equations , that make up the so - called reduced system .    in terms of the fixed point system ( [ na5 ] )",
    "the reduction process means that near the fixed point @xmath43 ( [ na5 ] ) can be written in the form @xmath47 where ( [ na11 ] ) is a local representation of the reduced fixed point system and ( [ na10 ] ) is functionally dependent on ( [ na11 ] ) .      in some cases",
    ", this reduction can be described more explicitly .",
    "this is the case of the following system in @xmath48 : @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "system ( [ etna5b ] ) is a particular case of the one considered in the example 1 of section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "some explanations about the related physical model will be then relegated to there , since here we are only interested in illustrating the reduction process .",
    "system ( [ etna5b ] ) admits the group of rotations @xmath51 as a symmetry group . in this case , the reduction can be carried out by using polar coordinates @xmath52 thus , in terms of the variables @xmath53 , where @xmath54 , the reduced system is of the form @xmath55",
    "the reduced fixed point system will mainly determine the local behaviour of the corresponding fixed point iteration for ( [ na5 ] ) .",
    "note that due to the local reduced form ( [ na10 ] ) , ( [ na11 ] ) and the hypotheses on @xmath4 , in a neighborhood of @xmath22 , the iteration matrix @xmath35 is similar to a block matrix of the form @xmath56 where @xmath43 , @xmath57 stands for the @xmath58 identity matrix and @xmath59 denotes the jacobian of @xmath60 with respect to the variables @xmath46 at @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "consequently , the spectrum of the iteration matrix @xmath35 consists of the eigenvalue @xmath36 , associated to the presence of the symmetry group @xmath4 and the spectrum of the iteration matrix of the reduced fixed point system at the orbit of @xmath22 .",
    "in particular ( see also @xcite ) ,    [ lemma21 ] assume the hypotheses ( a1 ) , ( a2 ) . if @xmath36 is not an eigenvalue of the iteration matrix of the reduced fixed point system at the orbit of @xmath22 , then the geometric and algebraic multiplicities of @xmath36 as eigenvalue of @xmath35 equals @xmath5 with the vectors in ( [ na3 ] ) forming a basis .",
    "the previous results are oriented to analyze the influence of the symmetries in the numerical resolution of ( [ na4 ] ) with the fixed - point iteration @xmath63 and given initial data @xmath64 .",
    "the concept of orbital convergence is now introduced .",
    "if @xmath21 is a solution of ( [ na4 ] ) , the iteration ( [ na12 ] ) is said to be orbitally convergent to @xmath22 if there are a neighborhood @xmath65 of @xmath22 and @xmath66 such that if @xmath67 then @xmath68 , defined by ( [ na12 ] ) , converges to @xmath69 .",
    "that is , orbital convergence means that the iteration converges locally to some element of the orbit of @xmath22 by the symmetry group ( [ na1 ] ) .",
    "orbital convergence looks to be the natural concept to treat the convergence for this kind of problems , since this must be understood in the quotient manifold @xmath14 .",
    "the structure of the iteration matrix @xmath35 , previously described , clarifies the procedure to obtain results on orbital convergence , since the spectrum of the iteration matrix of the reduced system at the orbit of @xmath22 coincides with the part of the spectrum of @xmath35 which is not associated to the symmetry group .",
    "for instance , the contraction mapping theorem , applied to the reduced system , leads to the following result ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "[ theorem1 ] assume that lemma [ lemma21 ] holds and any other eigenvalue of @xmath35 , different from @xmath36 is in magnitude below one .",
    "then the iteration ( [ na12 ] ) converges orbitally to @xmath22 .",
    "the structure of the iteration errors @xmath70 suggests an estimate , at first order , of the element of the orbit of @xmath22 to which the iteration converges .",
    "let us assume that theorem [ theorem1 ] holds .",
    "let @xmath71 and suppose that the initial error @xmath72 satisfies @xmath73 . by using the spectrum of @xmath35 , we can decompose @xmath74 for some @xmath75 .",
    "the term @xmath76 is the component of @xmath77 in the supplementary subspace @xmath37 of ker@xmath78 in @xmath2 , consisting of the other @xmath35 invariant generalized eigenspaces associated to the eigenvalues different from @xmath36 . on the other hand ,",
    "the second term of the error sequence can be written in the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 . if we assume that @xmath81 , @xcite , then @xmath82 can be written @xmath83 where @xmath84 . therefore , the second iterate is of the form @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "the previous arguments can be applied to a general step .",
    "we assume that @xmath87 with @xmath88 .",
    "then @xmath89 .",
    "now @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "now , if @xmath92 , then @xmath93 can be written @xmath94 where @xmath95 . therefore , the general @xmath96-th iterate is @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "thus , at @xmath99 order , @xmath100 approximates the element @xmath101 , associated to the projection of the initial iteration @xmath102 onto ker@xmath78 , plus a term @xmath103 that , according to theorem [ theorem1 ] , converges to zero .",
    "the previous results are illustrated by two examples .      given @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 we consider the @xmath107 system @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a @xmath107 diagonal matrix with the indicated diagonal elements , @xmath110 with @xmath111 and @xmath112 system ( [ etna41 ] ) , ( [ etna41b ] ) appears in the modelization of the @xmath0-body problem , where @xmath113 stands for the position of the @xmath42-th body with mass @xmath114 ( assuming a planar configuration ) and where @xmath115 denotes a central mass , which is supposed to be at the origin , @xcite .",
    "( the example considered in section [ sec:1 ] is a particular case with @xmath116 .",
    "this will be used again in the numerical experiments below . ) in the case of ( [ etna41 ] ) , the solutions correspond to a configuration where bodies form regular polygons around the mass @xmath115 , see figure [ nbody1 ] . assuming for simplicity that @xmath117 , a solution of ( [ etna41 ] ) , ( [ etna41b ] ) is of the form , @xcite @xmath118 the dynamics of the corresponding solution of the @xmath0-body system with initial data given by @xmath119 corresponds to a uniform rotation around @xmath120 with angular velocity given by @xmath121 , @xcite .        by way of first illustration of the orbital convergence , an iterative method for ( [ etna41 ] ) , ( [ etna41b ] ) is implemented with the goal of approximating the exact solution ( [ etna42 ] ) and its corresponding orbit . note that system ( [ etna41 ] ) can be written in the form ( [ na5 ] ) with @xmath128",
    "observe that @xmath129 is an homogeneous function of @xmath130 with degree @xmath131 .",
    "in particular , this implies that @xmath132 and therefore @xmath131 is an eigenvalue of the iteration matrix @xmath133 .",
    "this means that the fixed - point algorithm with iteration function @xmath129 will not be convergent in general .",
    "a typical alternative for this kind of homogeneous systems is the so - called petviashvili method .",
    "this method was originated in the context of the generation of lump solitary waves in the kp - i equation , @xcite , and it is widely used in this context , where nonlinearities with homogeneous functions are frequent .",
    "the application of the method to ( [ etna41 ] ) , ( [ etna41b ] ) is as follows . from @xmath134 , a sequence of approximations to @xmath119",
    "is generated by the formulas @xmath135 where @xmath136 is a free parameter and @xmath137 stands for the euclidean inner product in @xmath138 .",
    "the analysis of the method has been carried out in several papers and for some cases @xcite .",
    "essentially , local convergence , in both the classical and orbital sense , is obtained when @xmath139 is simple and is the only eigenvalue of @xmath133 with modulus greater than one and @xmath136 is chosen under the condition @xmath140 , with the best rate of convergence when @xmath141 .",
    "the arguments to obtain this result rely on the effect of the so - called stabilizing factor ( [ etna45 ] ) on the spectrum of @xmath133 .",
    "this factor acts like a filter , eliminating the direction of divergence provided by the eigenspace associated to @xmath139 , @xcite .",
    "thus , the jacobian of the iteration function of the procedure ( [ etna45 ] ) , ( [ etna46 ] ) at the fixed point shares the spectrum of @xmath133 except the harmful  ( from the point of view of the convergence ) eigenvalue @xmath139 , which is transformed to an eigenvalue with modulus below one ( eventually zero in the case @xmath141 ) .",
    "the procedure ( [ etna45 ] ) , ( [ etna46 ] ) is written as a fixed - point algorithm with iteration function given by @xmath142 .",
    "it will be considered to illustrate the orbital convergence for the system ( [ etna41 ] ) , ( [ etna41b ] ) .",
    "first , and according to the previous comments , the convergence can be checked from tables [ tab_na4 ] and [ tab_na1 ] . for @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and several values of @xmath115 ,",
    "these tables display , respectively , the eigenvalues of @xmath133 and of the iteration matrix @xmath145 , evaluated at the exact @xmath119 given by ( [ etna42 ] ) .       a final experiment , related to the profiles ( [ e426 ] ) , checks the local convergence and the effect of the components of the initial iteration associated to the symmetry on the limit profile .",
    "initial iterations of the form @xmath146 and several ( small ) values of @xmath147 , the phase shift of the final iterates have been computed and are shown in table [ tab_etna3 ] .",
    "the resulting displacements @xmath148 correspond , as @xmath147 decreases , to the limit profile @xmath149 associated to a spatial translation of @xmath147 .",
    "a second group of experiments checks the accuracy of the method to approximate solitary wave profile solutions of ( [ e422 ] ) for which explicit formulas are not known .",
    "we have taken @xmath150 and two speeds , @xmath151 . by using as initial iterations",
    "the profiles ( [ e426 ] ) with @xmath150 , the final iterates are shown in figure [ examp2f6 ] .",
    "for the first speed , figure [ examp2f6](a ) , the profiles are displaced with a phase shift ( the same , up to ten digits , for both @xmath152 and @xmath153 ) of @xmath154 , while for the waves of figure [ examp2f6](b ) , corresponding to the second value of the speed , the computed phase shift , for both components , is below the machine precision , therefore no displacement is assumed .",
    "the accuracy of the computed waves is checked in figures [ examp2f7 ] and [ examp2f8 ] .",
    "figure [ examp2f7 ] shows the residual error ( [ e4211 ] ) as function of the number of iterations and in logarithmic scale , for the computed profiles displayed in figure [ examp2f6 ] .",
    "as is known , ( [ e4211 ] ) measures the error generated by the iterations in the formula ( [ e424 ] ) for the profiles .",
    "the method gets a residual error of order of about @xmath155 in less iterations in the case @xmath156 than for @xmath157 .",
    "( the number of iterations depends , among others , on the preconditioning parameter @xmath158 in ( [ po ] ) .",
    "an optimal value of it may be different for different speeds . )    finally , a necessary test to check the accuracy of the computed profiles as solitary wave solutions of the bona - smith system ( [ bse ] ) consists of taking them as initial conditions of a code to integrate ( [ bse ] ) numerically .",
    "figure [ examp2f8 ] illustrates the evolution of the solution , by displaying the form of the corresponding approximation at different times .",
    "( the experiment corresponds to @xmath156 . )",
