    "there have been several surveys to directly image extrasolar planets for the ground with adaptive optics ( ao ) and from space with hst . until very recently all surveys returned null results , and so it was generally assumed that wide , massive , extrasolar planets would be rare ( at least around sun - like stars ) past 20 au ( @xcite ; @xcite and references within ) .",
    "however , in november 2008 @xcite announced the discovery of 3 planets orbiting the a5v star , based on near - ir imaging at the keck and gemini telescopes . using data from keck in 2004 - 2008 and gemini in 2007 - 2008 , they were able to establish common - proper motions ( assuming the non - common motion component of @xmath9 mas / yr for b and c was due to orbital motion of the planets around the star ) .",
    "the three planets , hr 8799b , c , and d orbit at approximately 68 , 38 and 24 au respectively .",
    "@xcite estimate effective temperatures of 870 , 1090 , and 1090k for the three planets , and arrive at estimates for mass of 7 , 10 , and 10 @xmath3 .",
    "these estimates are based on the estimated 30 - 160 myr age of hr 8799 and hybrid theoretical cooling tracks ( luminosity vs. age ) for giant planets @xcite .",
    "it is possible that additional companions could be discovered during a search at wider separations .",
    "the binary fraction of late a stars is at least 70% @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have predicted a population of giant planets at large separations ( 100 au - 10,000 au ) from stars hosting relatively close - in planets , where the distant objects are dynamically scattered / pumped to large separations after system assembly .",
    "such effects may explain the very wide , low mass , companions gq lup b at @xmath10 au @xcite and/or ab pic b at @xmath11 au @xcite .",
    "there is certainly the possible existence of low mass , reddened , stellar companions that have not yet been detected .",
    "it is even possible that hr 8799 has a small , common - proper motion group , around it . given the unique nature of the hr 8799 system , a search for wide ( @xmath10 au ) companions is important and motivated this paper .",
    "on oct . 30 1998 ut hst",
    "/ nicmos observed hr 8799 with its coronagraph , and 2 candidate companions were identified @xcite in the roll subtracted images .",
    "these faint point sources where reported at 13.7and 15.7(540 au and 619 au ) with h magnitudes of 21.6 and 20.4 , respectively .",
    "these are much wide separations than the 3 confirmed planets which were not discovered in the nicmos data at the time @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows our own roll subtraction of the otherwise already pipeline reduced nicmos data with the 2 objects identified .",
    "hr 8799 s high galactic latitude ( @xmath12 ) indicates that there is a finite chance one ( or both ) are not background objects ( see fig [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "however , we need to determine if these are real common proper motion companions or simply background objects . for lack of a better nomenclature",
    "we have elected to call the closest candidate `` hr 8799b '' and the farther one `` hr 8799c '' , however , the use of these labels does not imply they are physical companions .",
    "in october 25 , 2007 @xcite obtained 118x30s angular differential imaging ( adi ; @xcite ) dataset of hr 8799 on the gemini - north telescope with the altair ao system and niri nir camera .",
    "typically an adi dataset would not be the ideal method of imaging faint companions at 13.7and 15.7since there will be a risk of rotational blurring of the images in the azimuthal direction .",
    "however , in this hr 8799 dataset the integrations of 30s were short enough that only minimal azimuthal blurring occurred and only then in the fastest rotating images near transit .",
    "therefore , we were able to create a new custom `` adi - like '' iraf pipeline to produce `` wide field '' adi images ( wifi adi ) to image faint companions at the very edge of adi datasets . since the focus of wifi adi is wide companions",
    "there is no need to use more advanced adi reductions like loci @xcite .",
    "our wifi adi pipeline is very similar to standard adi reduction and runs in a standard iraf environment . in adi",
    "the telescope rotator is disabled and so the median of the images gives an estimate of the master psf without `` contamination '' from real objects on the sky .",
    "then one must subtract the master psf off each individual frame after a cross correlation alignment of each frame as in @xcite .",
    "once the frames have the psf removed they need to be rotated by the parallactic angle and median combined ( the subroutine to calculate the rotation angle is a custom script developed for gemini data in @xcite ) .",
    "one way that the wifi adi pipeline differs from the standard is that it is optimized to preserve any faint off - axis objects that might fall past the _ edge _ of the ir array in the majority of the individual adi frames .",
    "for example , the code accurately masks many bad pixels in the corners of the niri array and uses a final median combine of all 118 re - rotated ( master psf subtracted ) images with no pixel clipping or rejection ( so even the corner pixels of the individual frames are utilized in the final wifi image ) .",
    "we also carefully offset each image by the mode of the outer region of each image , this allows the final median combine to be most sensitive in the outer regions of the image .",
    "our wifi adi pipeline when used with the niri detector with its 0.0219/pixel scale is then capable of creating a round wifi adi fov of 31.71 in diameter when there is at least 90 degrees of field rotation during the adi observation , and the object is centered in the detector . in the case of the oct .",
    "25 2007 gemini hr 8799 data of @xcite the above assumptions are all true and our pipeline produced a final image ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) of all @xmath13 objects within @xmath14 of hr 8799 .",
    "as is clear from figure [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] there are two faint objects near hr 8799 . based on detailed search of the literature and the vlt / gemini / subaru / hst archives",
    "we have concluded that there has not been any published attempt to recover `` b '' or `` c '' until now .",
    "hr 8799a has a total proper motion of 119 mas / year so the recovery of the two candidate companions at the same separations as in 1988 wrt hr 8799a would be an unambiguous confirmation of their physical association .",
    "these objects are both fainter than the hd8799b - d planets ( they would have masses of 3 and 5 @xmath15 on the 0.1 gyr @xcite cond tracks ; which predict reasonable luminosities at these ages for higher mass objects ; @xcite ) , consistent with being scattered by the heavier , close - in , planets .    in figure [ figadia ] and [ figadib ] the 2007 positions of these two faint companions are shown . in both cases",
    "the current positions are much closer to the locations calculated for distant background objects rather than physical companions .",
    "therefore , our astrometry proves that the nicmos companions of @xcite appear to be faint background objects unrelated to hr 8799a ( see table [ tbl-1 ] for a detailed list of our astrometric measurements ) .      in the direction of pegasus",
    "most nearby stars appear to be moving towards the east south east .",
    "this is due to the sun s motion in the opposite direction wrt the lsr .",
    "in fact , the sun s space motion causes a stationary object ( wrt lsr ) at 39.9 pc to have a measured proper motion of 95.51 mas / yr to the east and 38.51 mas / yr to the south based on values for the solar motion given by @xcite . while it is clear that planets hr 8799b and hr 8799c have similar proper motions on the sky to hr 8799a ( see left side of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , once we subtract the solar motion there is less agreement ( see right side of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "however , this lack of common proper motion can be explained by increased velocity due to orbital motion of b and c around a @xcite .    for the planet",
    "hr 8799b ( which has the largest timeline of observations ) , there appears to be some `` scatter '' in its measured position from a from the nearly straight line expected for b s long period orbit .",
    "the exact solution for a stable orbit of the massive planets b , c , and d is still somewhat uncertain @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we consider the question what would this `` scatter '' resemble if b was actually a background object at 100 pc that had similar proper motions , by chance , to hr 8799a ( at a distance of 100 pc hr 8799b would roughly have the normal luminosity and colors of a background l dwarf ) . in this model",
    "b s position should show a `` reverse '' parallax w.r.t .",
    "hr 8799a with an amplitude of 60% that of hr 8799a s parallax .",
    "we calculate parallax of hr8799 in the usual manner @xcite and then multiply by -0.6 to calculate `` reverse '' parallax .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show two models for the nature of hr 8799b motion : a background object at 100 pc ; and a simple `` linear '' planetary arc .",
    "the small triangles in fig . [ fig5 ] denote time stamps in the 100 pc model to each observation date over the 9.885 yr period since the detection of b in a loci analysis of the nicmos dataset by @xcite .",
    "we note how neither the slightly curving `` linear '' orbit or the 100 pc background model fit all data points simultaneously inside the 1@xmath16 errorbars .",
    "the `` linear '' orbit is a simpler model with a better fit , but it certainly is not perfect since the reduced of @xmath17 gives an @xmath18 chance that it is the correct model assuming no unknown systematic errors in the astrometry . on the other hand , a background source at 100 pc model can be rejected with 99.95% confidence ( @xmath19 ) . while there is still significant scatter in the linear orbit fit for b , we can not reject it ( we also do not , at this time , know what orbit to fit it to @xcite ) .",
    "however , we can reject the hypothesis that this scatter in hr 8799b s position is reverse parallax due to it being a background object at 100pc ( assuming , of course , the reported astrometric values and errors are correct ) .",
    "even though the `` b '' and `` c '' objects are clearly background , there exists the possibility of other wider companions to hr 8799a that might be found by searching nearby for similar proper motion .",
    "we searched 12875 objects within @xmath20 of hr 8799 in the the us naval observatory merged astrometric dataset ( nomad ) catalog @xcite with non - zero proper motions .",
    "see figure [ fig7 ] for a plot of the resulting proper motion vectors .",
    "most objects inside @xmath21 of hr 8799 are background and so do not have as large a proper motion as hr 8799 , which is dominated by the sun s motion w.r.t the lsr . in figure [ fig7 ]",
    "we have highlighted those objects which have proper motion vectors within a circle of radius 20 mas / yr around hr8799 s proper motion .",
    "this yields a list of 15 objects , two of which may warrant follow up observations .",
    "we further discuss these objects below .    to increase our sensitivity to fainter objects that might have been missed by previous surveys we manually examined the palomar optical sky survey ( poss ) poss1 ( 1951 august 12 08:12:00 ut ) and poss2 ( 1991 october 02 05:47:00 ut ) red dss images to search for objects within 1 square degree of hr 8799a with similar proper motions .",
    "the poss1 image has a plate scale of @xmath22 per pixel , whereas poss2 has @xmath23 per pixel .",
    "we first magnified the poss1 image to match the poss2 plate scale .",
    "next 25 background stars were selected , and their positions measured by centroiding in each image .",
    "we then compared their positions on the two images to determine the optimum rotation ( @xmath24 degrees ) to apply to the poss1 image .",
    "we then selected an additional 25 background stars for a total of 50 stars spread across the images to build a background reference frame .",
    "proper motions were then measured for individual stars by determining the average relative change in offset from the 50 background stars between the 2 images    a different sample of 30 background stars was selected to test our technique . these were each compared to the 50 reference stars in each frame , and their proper motions were calculated from the average change in offset from the reference stars .",
    "the overall average of these measurements was @xmath25 mas / yr and @xmath26 mas / yr . we subtract these offsets from the proper motion measurements made for individual stars .    for bright stars",
    "there is a @xmath27 pixel uncertainty in centroid position ( estimated from @xmath28 , and for the faintest objects that we considered a @xmath29 pixel uncertainty .",
    "given the 40.139 year baseline between the two positions this amounts to @xmath30 mas / yr of proper motion uncertainty for bright stars , and @xmath31 mas / yr for faint objects .",
    "we combine these in quadrature with the standard error of our reference stars estimated from the 30 test stars above to obtain an estimated uncertainty of @xmath32 mas / yr and @xmath33 mas / yr . the bright star case compares favorably with other poss based proper motion surveys , e.g. @xcite with @xmath34 mas / yr .    the @xmath35 x @xmath35 area of sky centered on hr8799 was searched manually by blinking between the registered poss1 and poss2 images . in order to compensate for subtle changes in magnification and field distortion ,",
    "the image was re - centered on convenient background stars in each small area being searched .",
    "when a proper motion candidate was identified , its position was measured by centroiding and then its average change in offset relative to the 50 reference background stars was calculated .    as a check on our measurements",
    ", we compared our measurements of proper motion for 2 bright high proper motion stars in the field , nltt 55870 and nltt 55853 , with poss based proper motion measurements @xcite .",
    "we measured ( @xmath36 ) = ( 184.7 , -43.5 ) and ( 178.2 , -61.4 ) respectively compared to the values of ( 185 , -44 ) and ( 164 , -63 ) reported by @xcite .",
    "these measurements are consistent with each other within our bright star uncertainty of @xmath32 mas / yr .    we note that we are comparing measurements of proper motion relative to a sample of background stars , which is not the true absolute proper motion . @xcite discuss this systematic effect and attribute it to bulk motion of the reference stars .",
    "taking nltt 55870 and nltt 55853 as an example , they apply correction offsets of @xmath37 mas / yr and @xmath38 mas / yr to determine the absolute motion .",
    "we have not determined offsets for our own sample of reference stars , but given the agreement of our relative measurements with @xcite we apply the same offsets .",
    "the only definitive way to overcome this systematic effect for our purposes would be to simultaneously measure the proper motion of hr 8799 itself ( which has accurate hipparcos motions ) , however it is badly saturated in the poss images rendering measurements of its position uncertain to several pixels .",
    "we attempted to measure the proper motion of hr 8799 by determining best fit intersection of the horizontal and vertical diffraction spikes , obtaining a very uncertain estimate ( @xmath36 ) = ( 110 , -43 ) .",
    "this is close to the hipparcos value of hr 8799 s motion : ( @xmath36 ) = ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) mas / yr @xcite .",
    "though we did identify several faint candidate objects on the poss images with no obvious counterparts in nomad , only one appears worthy of further investigation with respect to the goals of this paper .",
    "this object is at a separation of 4.6@xmath41 from hr 8799a , with proper motions of @xmath42 .",
    "it is a very faint object , detected in the poss images with @xmath43 . in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )",
    "database it is designated j230716.69 + 210509.1 . through the sdss we also located it in the usno - b1 catalog @xcite . in usno - b1 it is not given a proper motion measurement .",
    "it quite clearly moves between poss images relative to nearby background stars , and it is close to nltt 55870 ( discussed above ) , which gives confidence that our detection of motion is not due to a local data reduction artifact .",
    "@xmath44 is @xmath45 from the expected value of a common proper motion companion of hr 8799a , however its proximity warrants further attention .",
    "we discuss this object in more detail below in section 4.1 .",
    "the large mass of the three planets combined implies a very large initial stellar nebula , and their large orbital radii present challenges for both the core accretion @xcite and the gravitational instability theories of planet formation @xcite .",
    "this system could perhaps be our best evidence for a new `` non - core - accretion '' mode of planet formation  hence the detection of any additional companions ( planetary or higher in mass ) is very important .",
    "the observations of marois et al .",
    "raise several interesting questions .",
    "the photometry shows a conspicuous lack of absorption by methane redwards of 1.6 @xmath46 m , which is expected for such relatively cool ( @xmath47 k ) objects like hr 8799b by all the `` hot - start '' @xcite or `` core - accretion '' @xcite synthetic spectra models .",
    "having performed photometry at several bands , they attempted to fit spectral energy distributions ( seds ) generated by a hybrid atmospheric modeling code .",
    "the best fit seds produced effective temperatures over 1400k ( @xcite on - line supplement ) .",
    "the authors argue that such high temperatures can not be supported by the observed low luminosities unless the objects are unreasonably small or each has significant dust extinction and reddening .",
    "they claim 3 edge - on dust disks which would be misaligned with the plane of their orbits ( which is nearly face - on) could explain such reddening , and so they rejected this dust reddening idea .",
    "we find that hr 8799 appears to be reddened by no more than @xmath48 mag ( from 2mass colors in @xcite compared to a zams a5 ) , making it impossible that line of sight extinction to hr 8799a alone is the cause .",
    "however , the lack of a `` reverse '' parallax in the astrometric residuals of b s separation from a ( see fig . [ fig5 ] ) offers strong proof that hr8799b is a physical companion of a. hence , it is unclear why hr8799b appears underluminous for its best fit model temperatures .",
    "perhaps strongly non - lte effects suppress @xmath49 in the outer atmosphere @xcite . in any case , the discovery of other wide reddened ( or underluminous ) companions would be very interesting in this system .",
    "therefore we need to investigate the properties of each proper motion candidate .",
    "the nomad database contains 15 objects with similar ( @xmath50 mas / yr ) proper motion to hr 8799a .",
    "nomad # 1115 - 0634383 ( see table [ tbl-2 ] ) has a wide @xmath51 separation from hr 8799a .",
    "it is red , with v = 16.64 and b - v color of 1.61 from the nomad magnitudes .",
    "nomad # 1108 - 0634609 is a tycho 2 star , tyc 1717 - 1120 - 1 .",
    "it is noteworthy due to its relatively bright v = 10.62 .",
    "though very likely not gravitationally bound to hr 8799a ( since at projected separations @xmath52x@xmath53 au from hr 8799a they would be wider than the widest known binaries ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ) , these objects may warrant further study to determine if they are co - moving with the hr 8799 system .",
    "the other objects in table [ tbl-2 ] appear to be a combination of too faint and too widely separated to warrant such speculation .",
    "our 1 square degree manual search of the poss images around hr8799 discovered one nearby object within @xmath45 of hr8799 .",
    "we will briefly discus this `` common proper motion '' candidate ( sdss j230716.69 + 210509.1 ) noted in table [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "we converted the sdss photometry using the relations given by @xcite , obtaining @xmath54 mag and @xmath55 mag .",
    "it is not in the 2mass point source catalog , however there are @xmath56 detections just above the non - gaussian noise in the j and ks 2mass images .",
    "though our measurement of its proper motion is marginally similar to hr 8799 , it appears to be too faint / blue to have a physical association based on its colors and magnitude it may be more distant than 39.9 pc .",
    "we by no means claim that this is definitive , as color based parallaxes are very uncertain . due to its relative proximity to hr8799 and the high interest in this system , further effort to confirm our proper motion measurement , obtain ir photometry , and perhaps obtain a radial velocity is warranted .    in summary , a cursory inspection of the proper motions and available photometry for these objects yields no strong candidates for a bound stellar companion to hr 8799 .",
    "nonetheless , given the importance of the hr 8799 system and the many astrophysical puzzles it presents , at least these 3 objects warrant further scrutiny .",
    "there is still a need for future work in the search for wide companions to hr 8799 . due to",
    "the brightness of hr 8799 on survey images there exists an annulus from @xmath57 which has not been adequately explored in this paper for stellar companions let alone planetary mass objects .",
    "the discovery of any such objects in this annulus could provide new insights into the planetary companions of hr 8799 .",
    "we have made the first direct comparison of newly wifi adi reduced archival gemini ao images to archival hst / nicmos coronagraphic images . with 9 years between these epochs",
    "we can accurately assess the proper motion nature of each companion .",
    "we find that both objects are unbound to hr 8799 and are background . in this paper",
    "our major conclusions are :          \\4 .",
    "while we identify no clearly bound companions to hr 8799a in our images ( beyond the extrasolar planet hr 8799b ) , our search yields 16 objects within 1 degree in the usno catalog or poss plates with similar ( @xmath8 mas / yr ) proper motions to hr 8799a .",
    "three of which merit follow - up observations .    the authors would like to thank glenn schneider for helpful discussions about nicmos coronagraphic data and andy skemer for helpful discussions about the lsr .",
    "this paper utilized data from the hst and gemini archives .",
    "this paper extensively used iraf , the dss , 2mass , sdss and simbad databases .",

    "<S> these objects are considerably fainter ( h=20.4 , and 21.6 mag ) and more distant ( projected separations of 612 , and 534 au ) than the three known planetary companions b , c , and d ( 68 - 24 au ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that these two objects could be lower mass planets ( of mass @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath3 ) that have been scattered to wider orbits . </S>",
    "<S> we make the first direct comparison of newly reduced archival gemini adaptive optics images to archival hst / nicmos images . with nearly a decade between these epochs </S>",
    "<S> we can accurately assess the proper motion nature of each candidate companion . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both objects are unbound to hr 8799 and are background . </S>",

    "<S> while we identify no bound companions to hr 8799 , our search yields 16 objects within 1 degree in the nomad catalog and poss dss images with similar ( @xmath8 mas / yr ) proper motions to hr 8799 , three of which warrant follow - up observations . </S>"
