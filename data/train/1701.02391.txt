    "recently , we introduced chem1d , a program for electronic structure calculations on one - dimensional ( 1d ) molecules .",
    "@xcite unlike previous workers who used softened@xcite or otherwise altered@xcite interelectronic interactions in their studies of 1d chemical systems , chem1d  employs the unadorned coulomb operator @xmath0 .",
    "this potential introduces a non - integrable singularity which requires special treatment . building on compelling arguments from the mathematical physics community ,",
    "@xcite our program avoids coulombic divergences by solving the schrdinger equation with dirichlet boundary conditions that require the wavefunction to vanish wherever two particles  electrons or nuclei  touch .",
    "the dirichlet conditions have three chemically interesting consequences .",
    "first , that molecular energies are spin - blind , i.e.  they are invariant with respect to spin - flips .",
    "second , that a `` super - pauli '' exclusion rule applies , i.e.  an orbital can not be occupied by more than one electron .",
    "third , that the nuclei become impenetrable , i.e.  electrons are unable to tunnel through them .",
    "@xcite     the severity of these effects means that this model does not reflect the same type of experimental systems as the `` quasi-1d '' methods characterised by softened coulomb interactions , which permit the nuclei to be penetrable and electrons to pair within spatial orbitals .",
    "this reflects situations where the 1d confinement is not strict , and so they are well suited to modelling confined experimental systems such as ultracold atoms confined within a 1d trap.@xcite     in contrast , the coulomb interaction used in this work describes particles which are _ strictly _ restricted to move within a 1d sub - space of three - dimensional space",
    ". early models of 1d atoms using this interaction have been used to study the effects of external fields upon rydberg atoms@xcite and the dynamics of surface - state electrons in liquid helium .",
    "@xcite this description of 1d chemistry also has interesting connections with the exotic chemistry of ultra - high magnetic fields ( such as those in white dwarf stars ) , where the electronic cloud is dramatically compressed perpendicular to the magnetic field.@xcite in these extreme conditions , where magnetic effects compete with coulombic forces , entirely new bonding paradigms emerge .",
    "@xcite    unfortunately , our previous investigation @xcite of 1d chemistry suffered from debilitating numerical stability issues .",
    "the chem1d  program uses basis sets related to the exact wavefunctions @xcite of the hydrogen molecule cation but these quickly develop near - linear - dependence problems that prevent chem1d  from achieving basis set convergence even for relatively modest molecular systems .",
    "in this paper we describe leglag , a more numerically stable version of chem1d , which can be applied to a wider range of molecules to gain deeper insight into 1d chemistry . in sec .  [",
    "sec : theory ] we introduce the orthogonal set of basis functions which leglag  employs and then briefly discuss the structure of the program . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we undertake an extensive study of 1d molecules , identifying multiple classes of stable species and the factors which lead to their stability . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : rules ] , we present a set of rules that govern chemical bonding in 1d .",
    "unless otherwise stated , atomic units are used throughout .     the ground state of the molecule .",
    "black circles represent the nuclei .",
    "each coloured region represents a singly - occupied orbital and the corresponding coloured diamond shows the most likely position of the electron.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "under dirichlet boundary conditions , nuclei are impenetrable to electrons and each electron in a molecule is therefore confined to a ray or line segment by the nuclei closest to it . in this way , the @xmath1 nuclei divide 1d space into two semi - infinite domains and @xmath2 finite domains .",
    "each domain supports a set of orbitals that vanish at the boundaries of the domain and outside it .",
    "figure [ fig : orbital_example ] illustrates this for a small diatomic molecule .    in order to specify the constitution of a molecule",
    ", we employ a notation in which atomic symbols indicate nuclei and subscripts indicate the numbers of electrons in the intervening domains .",
    "for example , is a triatomic with a lithium , boron and hydrogen nucleus arranged from left to right in that order .",
    "there is one electron to the left of the lithium nucleus , four electrons between the lithium and the boron nuclei , three electrons between the boron and the hydrogen nuclei and one electron to the right of the hydrogen nucleus . in the present work ,",
    "we consider only ground states and assume that the @xmath3 electrons within a domain singly occupy the @xmath3 lowest - energy orbitals .",
    "there are three types of domain  left , right and middle  and we require a set of basis functions for each .",
    "the functions should vanish at the domain boundaries and form a complete set .",
    "chem1d  uses the functions    [ eq : chem1dbasis ] @xmath4    where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the reduced coordinates in the left , right and middle domains respectively , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the positions of the leftmost and rightmost nuclei , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the center and halfwidth of a middle domain , @xmath12 is an exponent , and @xmath13 is the pochhammer symbol .",
    "@xcite the @xmath14 and @xmath15 functions are used in the left and right domains , respectively . @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "are used in the middle domains .",
    "one disadvantage of these functions is their increasing linear dependence as the size of the basis set grows , which creates numerical instability in the orthogonalisation step of the pople - nesbet hartree - fock ( hf ) method .",
    "@xcite this limits the size of basis set that can be employed before unacceptable numerical precision is lost .",
    "a second disadvantage of this basis set is that , because the @xmath16 and @xmath17 functions are increasingly peaked around the middle of the domain , they struggle to describe details of the molecular orbitals near domain boundaries .",
    "this becomes particularly problematic when the domain contains more than one electron .",
    "@xcite    in contrast , leglag  uses the basis functions    [ eq : lrm - bf ] @xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are second - order associated laguerre and legendre polynomials .",
    "@xcite ( our package s name stems from its use of legendre and laguerre polynomials . )",
    "the @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 functions are used in the left , right and middle domains , respectively , and are mutually orthogonal .",
    "the @xmath23 are evenly distributed across the domain , as fig .",
    "[ fig : bf_comparison ] shows .      in earlier work , we discovered @xcite that hf calculations @xcite give unexpectedly accurate results in 1d .",
    "it also appears , in contrast to the situation in 3d,@xcite that the mller - plesset ( mp ) perturbation series @xcite in 1d often converges rapidly to the exact energy .",
    "@xcite however , to perform such calculations it is necessary to evaluate the integrals    [ eq : ints ] @xmath24    where @xmath25 , @xmath26 is a density component , @xmath27 is the kinetic energy operator and @xmath28 is the kronecker delta function .",
    "@xcite    if the four basis functions are in the same domain , the singularity of the coulomb operator causes @xmath29 to diverge .",
    "however , the antisymmetrized integral @xmath30 is finite and can be found from quasi - integrals @xcite using @xmath31    because @xmath22 is the image of @xmath21 under inversion through the molecular mid - point , formulae involving only @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be found from the equivalent formulae involving @xmath21 and @xmath23 .",
    "we will therefore not discuss the former .",
    "integral formulae are given in appendix [ app : ints ] and most of the necessary special functions are evaluated by calling external libraries .",
    "however , because we invariably need a range of values for the @xmath32 and @xmath33 parameters in the tricomi confluent hypergeometric functions @xcite @xmath34 required for coulomb integrals involving the @xmath21 functions , it is more efficient to compute these functions recursively",
    ". it has been shown that backwards recurrence in the @xmath32 parameter is numerically stable and our algorithm exploits this.@xcite to obtain the starting values for this recurrence we use an asymptotic expansion that is valid when @xmath35 is large and positive.@xcite our numerical experiments have shown that for arguments @xmath36 this expansion converges at an unacceptable rate .",
    "our algorithm therefore uses miller s method@xcite when @xmath37 .",
    "we detect and avoid computing negligible integrals using the coulomb upper bound@xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the maximum potential of @xmath40 in the domain of @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the integral of @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath44 and @xmath45 values can be found using expressions in section [ app : prop ] .",
    "aside from integral evaluation , leglag  closely follows the algorithms employed in chem1d . for a comprehensive description of these ,",
    "see the paper by ball and gill .",
    "@xcite    leglag  has been implemented using the python programming language ( version 3.41 ) in combination with the cython language extension for compute - intensive bottlenecks .",
    "it employs the external numpy library for data structures and linear algebra operations and the scipy library for computing some of the special functions .",
    "a significant feature of leglag  is that it can be easily controlled by external python scripts . in generating the data presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we have made extensive use of scripts that use the numerical function minimiser available in scipy to optimize molecular geometries .     the exclusion potential ( red ) of a atom ( blue ) .",
    "the blue regions show the occupied orbitals when computing the exclusion potential at the position of the red dot.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      in 3d , the molecular electrostatic potential@xcite ( mesp ) is the limit of the ratio of the coulomb energy of a test particle to the magnitude of its charge , as that charge approaches zero .",
    "it is a potent tool for understanding chemical behaviour and can reveal , for example , electrophilic or nucleophilic regions . unfortunately , however , the mesp diverges at all points in a 1d system except where the electron density vanishes .",
    "@xcite therefore , to define a meaningful potential in a 1d molecule , we must insist that the test particle create a new dirichlet node at its position .",
    "we call the resulting potential the `` exclusion potential '' to emphasise that , in contradistinction to the 3d analog , the test particle in 1d excludes electrons from its neighbourhood and thereby significantly perturbs the system .    figure  [ fig : potential_construction ] shows the exclusion potential for a atom as well as the perturbed orbitals for a given position of the test particle .",
    "note how the dirichlet node created by the test particle compresses the right orbital , and prevents the electron which occupies it from extending to the right .",

    "the first three are bound and , in each , at least one of the atoms presents its electron - deficient side to the other atom .",

    "it follows that two nobles will not bind , as neither has an electron - deficient side . in 3d ,",
    "noble gas atoms can bind weakly through dispersion interactions , @xcite but we have not seen evidence of this in 1d .",
    "this may be an artefact of the ( 30,50 ) basis but we believe that such binding , if it exists , is likely to be very weak .    nuclear shielding ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bonding_diagrams]b ) is also critical .",
    "lighter atoms bind more strongly because their nuclei are less shielded and this is true _ a fortiori _ of the completely unshielded h atom . as the shielding increases ,",

    "the and molecules each hold a single electron in the internuclear domain and , naively , one might expect that would be more strongly bound because of its shorter bond and greater attraction between the bonding electron and nuclei . however , the bond strength in , where the atomic dipoles are favourably aligned , exceeds that in by roughly 50 m@xmath52 .",
    "similar arguments explain the relative strengths in and .",
    "the rare instances , e.g.  , where a diatomic forms with opposed dipoles are driven by the attraction between two electron - deficient sides .    the number of occupied domains ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bonding_diagrams]d ) is also relevant , as the very different bond energies in the hb diatomics show .",
    "why , for example , is is so much more weakly bound than , despite both having favourable dipole alignments ?",
    "the answer is that the six electrons are squeezed into two domains in , rather than three in . to form the former from the latter ,",
    "the electron from the left domain is promoted into a high - energy orbital in the right domain and this incurs a large energy cost .        in our earlier",
    "work,@xcite we discovered a few surprisingly long bonds .",
    "however , the results in table [ tab : diatomics ] show that gargantuan bond lengths are not at all uncommon in 1d .",
    "figure  [ fig : bondlengths ] reveals a strong correlation between the length of the middle domain of a diatomic and the number of electrons occupying it . if the data are grouped into those with aligned dipoles , those with opposed dipoles and those with a noble atom , strong parabolic trends emerge .",
    "similar behaviour is found for estimates of atomic radii .",
    "@xcite    this similarity might suggest that there is no significant distortion of atomic densities during the formation of a diatomic molecule .",
    "figure  [ fig : diatomic_densities ] depicts the difference in a selection of diatomic electron densities and the corresponding sum of atomic densities , showing that , in the majority of cases , this is true .",
    "more specifically , this assertion is true when the bonding alkali , i.e. the alkali with its electron deficient side in the bonding domain , is heavier than . in these cases",
    "we see the outermost electron of the other atom occupies the position of the lumo of the bonding alkali .",
    "the orbital that this electron occupies does not appreciably change in shape , however . as a result",
    "the bond length is completely determined by the shape of the atomic species .",
    "the exception to this are those diatomics where the bonding alkali is an atom .",
    "the unshielded proton of the atom is significantly more reactive than other species , an effect we also see when looking at bond strengths .",
    "this results in the outer electron of the other atom occupying an orbital similar to the lumo of the atom , rather than the homo of its parent atom .",
    "this creates a noticeable distortion of the atomic electron densities in such cases .",
    "the fact that each electron is largely isolated within its local domain provides little opportunity for complicated interelectronic interactions . as a result , we find that the qualitative and quantitative effects of electron correlation are usually small .",
    "the correlation energy in 1d constitutes a much smaller fraction ( typically less than 0.1% ) of the total energy than in 3d .",
    "moreover , it largely cancels between reactants and products so that correlated bond energies are typically within 1 m@xmath52  of their uncorrelated values .",
