    "jets are important tools in qcd for investigating the partonic substructure of hadrons and interactions among partons .",
    "there is no unique way to define a jet .",
    "it is thus important to compare and contrast the different available algorithms .",
    "the jet algorithms can be divided into two broad classes ; ( i ) successive combination @xcite : in this scheme , one defines a distance between a pair of objects and a beam distance for every object as follows : [ dist1 ] d_ij = ( k_t , i^2 p , k_t , j^2 p ) r_ij^2r^2 ,   d_ib= k_t , i^2 p. @xmath2 is called the distance between two particles @xmath3 and @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the distance between the beam and the particle ; @xmath6 is the transverse momentum of the @xmath3-th particle with respect to the beam direction and [ rij ] r_ij^2= ( _ i-_j)^2 + ( _ i-_j)^2 . at each step ,",
    "the smallest of all distances is determined . if it is a beam distance , the object",
    "is called a jet and is removed from the event ; otherwise the two objects @xmath7 are combined into a single one . examples of successive combination algorithms are the @xmath8 algorithm @xcite , where @xmath9 , and the anti-@xmath8 algorithm @xcite for which @xmath10 .",
    "\\(ii ) cone algorithms : in these algorithms the jet is defined in terms of stable cones as circles of fixed radius in the @xmath11-@xmath12 plane , such that the sum of the @xmath13-momenta of the particles in it points in the direction of the center of the cone .",
    "one defines the jet by all particles @xmath4 that satisfy @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the pseudo - rapidity and azimuthal angle of the jet , respectively .",
    "higher order qcd corrections are important as the dependence on the factorization and renormalization scales is expected to be reduced when the corrections are included . in the case of jet production ,",
    "higher order corrections are particularly important , as only at nlo the qcd structure of the jet starts to play a role in the theoretical description of the process .",
    "in fact , some of the popular cone algorithms are known to be collinear and infra - red unsafe at nnlo or when multiple jets are considered .",
    "single inclusive large @xmath0 jets in longitudinally polarized @xmath1 collisions at rhic are important tools to gain access to the polarized gluon distribution in the nucleon .",
    "the cross section for single inclusive jet production at rhic has been calculated at nlo using a monte - carlo technique @xcite in the cone algorithm .",
    "however a largely analytic technique was developed in @xcite in the limit when the cone opening is relatively small ( small cone approximation ) .",
    "this is advantageous because it leads to much faster and more efficient computer codes as the singularities in the intermediate steps cancel analytically and one does not have to treat them through delicate numerical techniques .",
    "the basis of such an analytic calculation is the observation that the inclusive jet production proceeds through the same partonic subprocesses as single inclusive hadron production and it is possible to convert an nlo cross section for single inclusive hadron production to the one for jet production .",
    "the main difference between the two cases is the fact that in single inclusive hadron production , one integrates over the full phase space of the unobserved partons .",
    "this leads to collinear singularities , which are absorbed in the parton to hadron fragmentation functions .",
    "in contrast , for a jet , final - state particles that move in roughly the same direction will jointly produce the jet .",
    "this makes the cross section more inclusive , and ( for a proper jet definition ) final state singularities must cancel .",
    "the cross section for single inclusive hadron production can however be transformed into that for single inclusive jet production @xcite . in the limit of small cone",
    "size , this transformation can even be performed analytically .",
    "we have recently extended the above analytic technique to the more widely used successive combination schemes ( for example , @xmath8 or anti-@xmath8 ) , assuming again that the jet parameter @xmath17 used to define the distance between two objects in this algorithm is not too large @xcite .",
    "when systematically expanded around @xmath18 , the dependence of the partonic cross sections on @xmath17 is of the form @xmath19 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath21 are calculated analytically , and the remaining terms @xmath22 and beyond are neglected .",
    "we refer to this approximation as `` narrow jet approximation '' ( nja ) .",
    "the nja gives a very accurate description of the single inclusive jet cross sections at rhic , tevatron and even at the lhc @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the cross sections for single inclusive jet production in the cone and the successive recombination algorithms differ by calculable finite terms .",
    "we have also given numerical estimates of the cross section both for unpolarized and longitudinally polarized collisions at rhic , and examined the effect of the choice of jet algorithm on the double longitudinal spin asymmetry .",
    "here we give a brief report of @xcite .",
    "we consider single - inclusive jet production in hadronic collisions , @xmath23 , where the jet has a transverse momentum @xmath24 , rapidity @xmath15 , and azimuthal angle @xmath16 .",
    "note that on top of the choice of jet algorithm one also has to define how objects are to be merged to form the jet . we choose to define the four - momentum of the jet as the sum of four - momenta of the partons that form the jet for both algorithms ( `` @xmath25 recombination scheme ''  @xcite ) .    in order to calculate the single - inclusive jet cross section at nlo ,",
    "we start from the nlo single - parton inclusive cross sections @xmath26 , relevant for single - inclusive hadron production process @xmath27 and analytically known . for a jet cross section , the observed final state should not be given by parton @xmath28 only , but by partons @xmath28 and @xmath29 jointly , when the two are close to each other ( as two partons together can form the jet ) . in order to calculate this",
    "one first considers a `` jet cone '' characterized by a jet parameter @xmath17 around the observed parton @xmath28 and notices that in the nlo single - parton inclusive cross section there is a configuration where an additional parton @xmath29 is inside the cone ( we use the term `` cone '' for simplicity , the considerations apply to any jet definition ) .",
    "one subtracts these contributions and replaces them by terms for which partons @xmath28 and @xmath29 are both inside the cone and form the observed jet together . for a given partonic process @xmath30",
    "we then have , @xmath31\\nonumber\\\\[1 mm ] & + &   [ d \\hat{\\sigma}_d -d \\hat{\\sigma}_{d(c)}- d \\hat{\\sigma}_{d(e)}]\\nonumber\\\\[1 mm ] & + & [ d   \\hat{\\sigma}_e -d \\hat{\\sigma}_{e(c)}- d \\hat{\\sigma}_{e(d)}]\\nonumber\\\\[1 mm ] & + & d \\hat{\\sigma}_{cd } + d \\hat{\\sigma}_{ce}+ d \\hat{\\sigma}_{de } . \\label{jetform}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath32 is the single - parton inclusive cross section where parton @xmath4 is observed ( which also includes the virtual corrections ) , @xmath33 is the cross section where parton @xmath4 is observed but parton @xmath34 is also in the cone , and @xmath35 is the cross section when both partons @xmath4 and @xmath34 are inside the cone and jointly form the jet .",
    "one has to note that the single - parton inclusive cross section contains a subtraction of final - state collinear singularities in the modified minimal subtraction ( @xmath36 ) scheme .",
    "one has to perform an @xmath36 subtraction also of the singularities in the @xmath37 .",
    "the difference between the cone and @xmath8 type algorithms resides entirely in the @xmath35 , which can be calculated analytically in the nja .",
    "the reason for this difference is as follows : for the @xmath8-type algorithms the two partons @xmath7 are merged into one jet if their distance defined in  ( [ dist1 ] ) is smaller than their respective beam distances @xmath5 and @xmath38 defined in  ( [ dist1 ] ) . for @xmath35",
    "this has to hold , and we arrive at the condition [ j1 ] r_jk^2r^2 k_t , with @xmath39 defined in eq .",
    "( [ rij ] ) .",
    "this condition is true for _ all _ @xmath8-type algorithms . whereas in cone algorithm , eq .",
    "( [ eq : conedef ] ) is valid : [ j2 ] r_jj^2 r^2 r_kj^2 r^2 .",
    "we find that the difference in the cross sections calculated for the two algorithms is finite , as it must be .",

    "we use the cteq6.6 m parton distributions  @xcite for the unpolarized cross section and the `` dssv '' helicity parton distributions of ref .",
    "@xcite for the polarized case .",
    "we define the ratio _ , where the jet parameter @xmath17 is the same for both cross sections .    figure  [ fig : ratio2pol ] shows the ratio @xmath40 for polarized collisions at rhic , calculated for the factorization and renormalization scales as @xmath44 , as a function of @xmath24 in bins of @xmath24 , for @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we present results for two values of c. m. s. energies at rhic , @xmath47  gev ( left ) and @xmath48  gev ( right ) .",
    "@xmath40 is around 90% at high @xmath24 , but deviates largely from one in the bin around @xmath49  gev .",
    "the reason for this is that for the dssv set of parton distributions the polarized jet cross section changes sign around @xmath50  gev .",
    "depending on the jet algorithm , the zero is at a slightly different value of @xmath0 .",
    "this shows that in regions where the polarized cross section is very small it is very sensitive to the choice of jet algorithm .",
