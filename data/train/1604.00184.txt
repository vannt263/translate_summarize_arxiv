    "<S> * the importance of antiferromagnetic fluctuations are widely acknowledged in most unconventional superconductors @xcite . in addition , cuprates and iron pnictides often exhibit unidirectional ( nematic ) electronic correlations @xcite , including stripe and orbital orders , whose fluctuations may also play a key role for electron pairing @xcite . however , these nematic correlations are intertwined with antiferromagnetic or charge orders , preventing us to identify the essential role of nematic fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this calls for new materials having only nematicity without competing or coexisting orders . here </S>",
    "<S> we report systematic elastoresistance measurements in fese@xmath0s@xmath1 superconductors , which , unlike other iron - based families , exhibit an electronic nematic order without accompanying antiferromagnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the nematic transition temperature decreases with sulphur content @xmath2 , whereas the nematic fluctuations are strongly enhanced . near @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , the nematic susceptibility diverges towards absolute zero , revealing a nematic quantum critical point . </S>",
    "<S> this highlights fese@xmath0s@xmath1 as a unique nonmagnetic system suitable for studying the impact of nematicity on superconductivity . *    in underdoped cuprate superconductors , unidirectional electronic correlations ( stripe correlations ) </S>",
    "<S> appear in the pseudogap state , whose relation with superconductivity is a centre of debate . </S>",
    "<S> it has become more complicated after the charge density wave ( cdw ) order has been observed in a portion of this pseudogap region of the phase diagram @xcite . in iron pnictides , </S>",
    "<S> the tetragonal - to - orthorhombic structural transition always precedes or coincides with the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) transition @xcite . below the structural transition temperature @xmath4 , electronic nematicity that represents a large electronic anisotropy breaking the @xmath5 rotational symmetry , </S>",
    "<S> is observed @xcite , which may have a similar aspect with the stripe correlations in underdoped cuprates . in both cases , however , the nematicity is largely coexisting and intertwined with other cdw and afm orders . </S>",
    "<S> large nematic fluctuations have been experimentally observed in bafe@xmath6as@xmath6 systems above @xmath4 , and these nematic fluctuations are strikingly enhanced with approaching the end point of the structural transition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests the presence of a nematic quantum critical point ( qcp ) , but in this case the nematic qcp coincides with , or locates very close to the afm qcp , where antiferromagnetic fluctuations are also enhanced @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this raises a fundamental question as to which fluctuations are the main driving force of the cooper pairing in this system .    </S>",
    "<S> recently there is growing evidence that the iron - chalcogenide fese displays remarkable properties . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting transition temperature of @xmath7k at ambient pressure is largely enhanced up to 38k under pressure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further enhancement of @xmath8 has been reported in monolayer fese @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> what is important in this system is that despite its high nematic transition temperature of @xmath9k @xcite , no magnetic order occurs down to @xmath10k . above @xmath4 , </S>",
    "<S> large nematic fluctuations are reported but , unlike iron pnictides , no sizable afm fluctuations are observed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the enhanced nematic fluctuations most likely have an orbital origin , because a momentum - dependent orbital polarization has been found in angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy in the nematic phase below @xmath4 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , it has been shown that the high - energy spin excitations measured by the inelastic neutron scattering do not show significant temperature dependence above @xmath4 @xcite , which indicates no direct correlations between dynamical spin susceptibility @xmath11 and the nematic susceptibility , inconsistent with the spin - nematic scenario @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although these results point to that the nematic transition in fese is orbital driven , the most important issue , namely the presence of a nonmagnetic nematic qcp at which the nematic fluctuation diverges with @xmath12k , remains open . </S>",
    "<S> the presence or absence of such a qcp should provide pivotal information on the superconductivity of iron - based high-@xmath8 materials . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown very recently that the applying pressure leads to the suppression of @xmath4 , but near the critical pressure at which @xmath4 vanishes , the magnetic ordering is induced @xcite , preventing our understanding of the interplay between nematicity and superconductivity .    </S>",
    "<S> recent advances in the crystal growth of iron chalcogenides by using the chemical vapour transport technique @xcite allow us to grow high - quality single crystals of fese@xmath0s@xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the high quality of the obtained crystals is evidenced by the observation of quantum oscillations in a wide range of @xmath2 ( kasahara , s. _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ , and coldea , a.i . </S>",
    "<S> _ et al . _ , unpublished results ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we report that the partial substitution of isoelectric s for the se site @xcite leads to the complete suppression of this nematic transition without inducing the afm order . </S>",
    "<S> moreover @xmath14 shows a maximum at @xmath15 in fese@xmath0s@xmath13 , suggesting the presence of superconducting dome . </S>",
    "<S> therefore fese@xmath0s@xmath13 appears to be a key material to investigate a possible correlation between the nonmagnetic nematic fluctuations and the superconductivity .    </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the in - plane resistivity @xmath16 in these high - quality crystals shows a kink at the nematic transition at @xmath4 , which is gradually decreased to lower temperatures ( fig.1a ) . at high concentrations @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> , the kink anomaly of @xmath16 disappears , which is more clearly seen in the temperature derivative @xmath18 ( fig.1b ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the physical pressure case where another clear anomaly at a temperature different from @xmath4 is reported indicating the appearance of a magnetic transition , we find no such anomaly in the entire @xmath2 range of this study , which implies that the ground states of this system are nonmagnetic up to at least @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> an elegant way to evaluate experimentally the nematic fluctuations has been developed by the stanford group , that is based on the elastoresistance measurements by using a piezoelectric device @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we utilize this technique in our fese@xmath0s@xmath13 to extract the temperature dependence of the so - called nematic susceptibility @xmath20 . here </S>",
    "<S> the change in the resistance @xmath21 induced by the strain that can be controlled by the voltage applied to the piezoelectric device is measured as a function of strain @xmath22 ( fig.2a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity @xmath23 is proportional to the nematic order parameter , and thus its fluctuations can be quantified by the nematic susceptibility @xmath24 , which is given by the slope of the @xmath25 versus @xmath22 curve @xcite . to cancel the effect of anisotropic strain induced in the piezoelectric device ( the poisson effect ) @xcite , we measured the resistance changes @xmath26 and @xmath27 for two current directions orthogonal each other in fese ( @xmath28 ) crystals ( figs.2a , b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the nematic susceptibility data obtained from @xmath26 and @xmath27 are essentially identical to those from @xmath26 alone ( fig.3a ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we measure only @xmath26 for substituted samples @xmath29 to avoid the effect of small difference of the composition @xmath2 in different crystals from the same batch . </S>",
    "<S> the sign of the nematic susceptibility above @xmath4 is positive , which corresponds to the positive value of @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 represent the orthorhombic crystal axes ( @xmath33 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this positive sign is consistent with the previous results in fese @xcite and fete@xmath34se@xmath35 @xcite , but is opposite to the co - doped bafe@xmath6as@xmath6 case @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this sign difference may be related to the difference of fermi surface structure , which determines the anisotropic scattering of quasiparticles in the nematic state @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the obtained nematic susceptibility shows a systematic trend as a function of the sulphur content @xmath2 ( figs.3a - e ) . in the tetragonal state above @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath36 can be fitted to the curie - weiss type temperature dependence given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath31 are constants , and @xmath39 is the weiss temperature , which represents the electronic nematic transition temperature without the lattice coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the observed changes in the resistance is given by @xmath40 , the last two terms on the right hand side represent geometric factors related to changes in the length @xmath41 and cross - sectional area @xmath42 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these terms contribute to the temperature - independent term @xmath43 in eq.(1 ) , which is dominant in simple metals . in the present fese@xmath0s@xmath13 system , however , @xmath36 has strong temperature dependence , indicating that nematic fluctuations are very large . with a proper choice of @xmath43 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath44 follows nearly @xmath45-linear dependence in a wide temperature range of the tetragonal phase , consistent with the curie - weiss law ( eq.(1 ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the obtained phase diagram based on our single - crystal study is given by fig.4 . </S>",
    "<S> the nematic transition temperature @xmath4 monotonically decreases and vanishes at @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the weiss temperature @xmath39 crosses the zero line and changes sign at @xmath3 , where the magnitude of @xmath20 is strongly enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> these results provide clear evidence that the nematic qcp is present near this composition @xmath47 , where nematic fluctuations are diverging toward @xmath10k . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the present measurements are performed under identical conditions in a series of samples with similar dimensions and thus the obtained systematic results represent intrinsic properties of this system . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the recent quantum oscillations and low - field magnetoresistance experiments indicate that the electronic structure of high - concentration samples ( @xmath48 ) is quite different from that of low-@xmath2 crystals ( kasahara , s. _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ , and coldea , a.i . </S>",
    "<S> _ et al . _ , unpublished results ) , which is indicative of distinctly different ground states in the two regimes , consistent with the quantum phase transition found in the present study .    </S>",
    "<S> near the qcp , the @xmath36 data exhibit some deviations from the curie - weiss temperature dependence ( grey regions in figs.3c - e , h - j ) . </S>",
    "<S> such deviations have also been frequently found in iron - based superconductors when @xmath4 becomes low @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of these deviations from the curie - weiss law has not been fully understood , but one should consider possible effects of impurity scattering that may be modified by quantum criticality . in the theory of magnetic quantum critical point , </S>",
    "<S> various physics quantities show non - fermi liquid behaviour , and magnetic susceptibility may deviate from the curie - weiss law @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic susceptibility directly couples to the correlation length , which depends on dimension and dynamical exponent of the system according to the hertz - millis theory @xcite . in analogy to this </S>",
    "<S> , the nematic correlation length in the presence of disorder would have some characteristic temperature dependence different from the fermi - liquid behaviour , and then the deviations from curie - weiss law may be expected in the nematic susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> when the effects of disorder is strong , it has been discussed that the so - called griffith singularity may occur , which modifies the critical behaviour @xcite . in any case , these disorder effects should weaken the divergent behaviour especially near the qcp , which is consistent with our results .    </S>",
    "<S> the present results provide evidence that a nonmagnetic nematic qcp lies in the superconducting phase , which has the same topology as the phase diagrams of iron pnictides @xcite and heavy fermions @xcite in which afm qcp locates inside the superconducting dome . </S>",
    "<S> however , this new kind of qcp has several different aspects from the well - studied afm qcp . </S>",
    "<S> first , the resistivity data ( fig.1a ) shows non-@xmath49 dependence for all the sample we measured , and we find no significant enhancement in the residual resistivity near the nematic qcp , which appears to be different from the expectations in the magnetic qcp case @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , in iron pnictides @xmath8 shows the maximum at around the afm qcp @xcite , where s in the present system @xmath8 shows a maximum deep inside the nematic ordered phase , not at the nematic qcp . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the critical nematic fluctuations do not have simple correlations with the @xmath14 enhancement , although some theoretical calculations propose a @xmath14 peak at a nematic qcp @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> possible origins of this unexpected result are related to the fact that the nematic order is most likely a ferro - type order with the wave vector @xmath50 , which is different from afm order with a finite @xmath51 . in a ferro - type order , </S>",
    "<S> the fermi surface change is not as dramatic as in the antiferro - type order in which band - folding occurs , and thus the competition between superconductivity and ferro - nematic order may be much more modest . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the unusual lack of coupling between superconductivity and orthorhombic distortion in nonmagnetic fese has been reported by the thermal expansion measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another factor which may be relevant here is the enhanced quasiparticle damping effect near a ferro - type qcp , that can suppress @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , such a scenario has been discussed in ferromagnetic superconductors , such as uge@xmath6 , in which the peak of the @xmath8 dome is not located at a ferromagnetic end point @xcite . however , the resistivity curves do not show a dramatic change near the present nematic qcp , and thus further studies are necessary to clarify this point .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that in cuprate superconductors the importance of nematic electronic correlations has been suggested as well @xcite , and the quantum criticality of the cdw or the pseudogap phase has been discussed @xcite . in yba@xmath6cu@xmath52o@xmath53 @xcite and yba@xmath6cu@xmath54o@xmath55 </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , however , opposite correlations between @xmath8 and the quasiparticle mass enhancement associated with the putative quantum phase transition have been reported , causing controversy on the relationship between quantum fluctuations and superconductivity in cuprates . to solve this issue </S>",
    "<S> it would be important to separate the effects of cdw order from the nematic correlations in the pseudogap state .    </S>",
    "<S> the present discovery of the nematic qcp and enhanced ferro - type nematic fluctuations without coexisting or competing magnetic order in fese@xmath0s@xmath13 may provide a unique avenue to study the unconventional superconductivity mediated by exotic mechanisms other than spin fluctuations . </S>"
