    "on the contrary , since the transverse pressure is used ( in both the semi - analytic model and the numerical estimates ) to _ calculate _ the energy density and radial tension any discrepancy in these quantities must be ascribed to actual error ( either numerical roundoff of something more systematic ) rather than failure of the fit  @xcite .",
    "there is an important consistency check that the semi - analytic model should pass : elster has calculated  @xcite the total luminosity of a black hole against scalar emission using standard techniques  @xcite which are totally orthogonal to the present analysis . at each frequency",
