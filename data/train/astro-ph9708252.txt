    "a key part of measuring the hubble constant , @xmath9 is to look out far enough so that the bulk velocities of galaxies are trivial compared to the hubble flow itself . due to the virgo cluster infall pattern ,",
    "observation of the unbiased hubble flow can only be contemplated at distances in excess of @xmath10 km s@xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , bulk flows on even larger scales , such as those associated with the great attractor , may bias measurement of @xmath11 turner , cen , & ostriker ( 1992 ) and shi , widrow , & dursi ( 1996 ) , for example , show that under standard theories of structure formation , measurements of @xmath6 can depart significantly from its true `` global '' value due to the inhomogeneous distribution of matter in the universe , unless care is taken to sample deeply with large angular coverage .",
    "indeed , a common concern with many recent @xmath6 determinations is that they are not truly sampling the distant hubble flow ( bartlett et al .",
    "1995 ) .    characterizing the far - field requires observing large numbers of objects at large distances so that the hubble diagrams are insensitive to random peculiar velocities or bulk flows .",
    "hubble diagrams at present are largely based on the tully - fisher or @xmath12 relationships , the luminosities of supernovae ( sn ia or sn ii ) , and brightest cluster galaxies ( bcg ) .",
    "tully - fisher distances are available out to @xmath39,000 km s@xmath0 and have been recently used to measure a far - field @xmath6 ( giovanelli et al , 1997 ) , while @xmath12 have full - sky coverage out to only @xmath36,000 km s@xmath13 only a few sn ii have been observed in sufficient detail at large distances ( schmidt et al .",
    "1994 ) , but the snia hubble diagram is becoming richer with time and provides some sampling of the hubble flow out to @xmath330,000 km s@xmath4 ( riess , press , & kirshner 1996 ; hamuy et al .",
    "1996 ) . at present",
    ", however , calibration of the snia distance scale remains controversial ( see sandage et al .",
    "1996 ) , and the sn ia diagrams remain relatively sparse at large distances . in this work",
    "we focus on calibrating the bcg hubble diagram , which is based on a recent characterization of bcg as relative distance estimators ( postman & lauer 1995 ) .    in the classic work of sandage ( 1972 ) and",
    "sandage & hardy ( 1973 ) , bcg were used to show that the hubble flow was linear over a large range in redshift .",
    "lauer & postman ( 1994 ) observed bcg to define a frame for measuring the peculiar velocity of the local group , but as this work was in progress they realized that they could test for @xmath6 variations with distance with greater precision than was previously available in response to the concerns of turner , cen , & ostriker ( 1992 ) .",
    "lauer & postman ( 1992 ) presented a hubble diagram based on the 114 bcg that defined the volume - limited full - sky sample of abell clusters within 15,000 km s@xmath0 which is shown again here in figure [ bcg_hub ] . in brief , the absolute magnitudes of bcg , @xmath14 measured in apertures of fixed metric size , @xmath15 can be predicted from @xmath16 ( hoessel 1980 ) .",
    "figure [ bcg_hub ] shows the metric luminosities as apparent fluxes , corrected by the @xmath17 relationship to a standard value of @xmath18    the bcg hubble diagram slope is @xmath19 of the expected value , consistent with a uniform hubble flow over @xmath20 lauer & postman ( 1992 ) limit any variation in the _ apparent _ or local @xmath6 ( the hubble constant measured over a limited depth ) as compared to @xmath6 measured globally over the entire volume , to @xmath21 the snia hubble diagram also shows no evidence for @xmath6 variations with distance ; riess , press , & kirshner ( 1996 ) show its slope ( relative to euclidean ) to be @xmath22 the full - sky coverage of the abell cluster sample is crucial , as any dipole pattern caused by large bulk flows ( such at that advanced by lauer & postman 1994 ) will integrate out of the hubble diagram to first order .",
    "the linearity of the bcg hubble diagram shows that an excellent estimate of the far - field @xmath6 can be obtained once the zero point of the diagram is calibrated .",
    "we note that bcg presently provide the only volume - limited sample that explores the hubble flow at these distances .",
    "a hubble constant can be obtained from the bcg hubble diagram once an absolute distance is known to a subset of the galaxies . in essence , one transfers the full sample to a common distance , and finds the average absolute luminosity of the bcg on the assumption that the calibrating set is typical . random velocities and bulk flows of the bcg contribute to the `` cosmic scatter '' in their luminosity distribution , but cause no systematic offset ( with the caveats discussed in @xmath23[far_enough ] ) .",
    "we contrast this approach to others that use the apparent distance ratio between the virgo and coma clusters , or any other near and far aggregate of galaxies , to reach the far - field .",
    "instead , we are using the bcg as complete probes of the hubble flow over a large volume .",
    "we chose to calibrate the bcg hubble diagram with surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) distance estimates to four of the nearest bcg . the sbf method ( tonry & schneider 1988 ) uses the ratio of the second to first moments of the stellar luminosity function within early - type stellar systems as a distance estimator .",
    "the ratio of moments corresponds to an apparent magnitude , , that in the near - ir corresponds to the brightness of a typical red giant star .",
    "when the images are deep enough such that a star of apparent luminosity  contributes more than a single photon to an observation , the random spatial point - to - point surface brightness fluctuations in a galaxy image are dominated by the finite number of stars it comprises , rather than photon shot noise .",
    "a power spectrum of the sbf pattern provides .",
    "use of the sbf method on galaxies with distances known from other methods ( see jacoby et al .",
    "1992 for additional details ) provides the zero point , allowing absolute distances to be computed from .",
    "the most recent calibration of the sbf method is presented by tonry et al .",
    "major components of this work are : 1 ) understanding how  varies with stellar population , 2 ) determining the zero point of the method , and 3 ) establishing the universality of the calibration .",
    "tonry et al .",
    "observe in the @xmath1 band , which minimizes variations in with stellar population _",
    "ab initio .",
    "_ they also show that variations in  are fully characterized by the ( @xmath24 ) colors of the stellar systems .",
    "based on 149 nearby galaxies they find @xmath25.\\ ] ] this relationship has scatter of only 0.05 mag and agrees well with the theoretical calculations of worthey ( 1993a , 1993b ) both in slope _ and _ zero point .",
    "tammann ( 1992 ) was concerned that an earlier sbf calibration based on @xmath26 was incomplete and that  additionally depended on the galaxies @xmath27 indices . in response ,",
    "tonry et al .",
    "use their extensive sample to show that there is no correlation between the residuals of equation ( [ eqmibar ] ) and @xmath28 the zero point of equation ( [ eqmibar ] ) is based on cepheid distances to seven spiral galaxies with bulge sbf observations .",
    "tonry et al .",
    "present numerous comparisons of sbf to pnlf , tully - fisher , @xmath29 , snia , and sn ii distances , finding no evidence for any systematic offset between sbf bulge and elliptical galaxy measurements , nor any other systematic effect that challenges the calibration .",
    "although the nearest bcg are too far away for the sbf method to work from the ground , the high spatial resolution of _ hst _ allows sbf to be used beyond the 15,000 km s@xmath4 depth of the lauer & postman ( 1994 ) sample .",
    "an important caveat is that there is no direct match to the @xmath1 filter among the wfpc2 filter set .",
    "the f814w filter is a close analogue to @xmath1 ( see holtzman et al .",
    "1995a ) , but requires additional calibration to tie it to the tonry et al .",
    "( 1997 ) zero point .",
    "ajhar et al .",
    "( 1997 ) accomplished this task in preparation for the present work , by comparing _",
    "f814w sbf observations to the @xmath1 results for 16 galaxies in the tonry et al . sample .",

    "is the steeper relationship between 8bar and @xmath31 which ajhar et al .",
    "show is consistent with the differences between the f814w and @xmath1 filters .",
    "calibration of _ hst _ for sbf work is thus crucial for the present work .",
    "we selected the bcg in four abell clusters , a262 , a3560 , a3565 , and a3742 for observation . these are among the nearest of the lauer & postman ( 1994 ) sample so as to minimize _ hst _ exposure time .",
    "we also wanted to minimize the effects of bulk flows on placement of the calibrating bcg within the hubble diagram , so we selected bcg positioned such that their mean photometric offset about the hubble line in figure [ bcg_hub ] is largely insensitive to whether the hubble diagram is constructed from velocities referenced to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , local group ( lg ) , or the abell cluster ( ac ) frame solution of lauer & postman ( 1994 ) .",
    "figure [ bcg_hub_frame ] shows how the positions of the bcg in the hubble diagram change with changing velocity system .",
    "complete frame invariance of the results is difficult to achieve with only four bcg , however ; we discuss this issue later where our results are affected by it .",
    "the bcg properties are given in table [ tabsamp ] .",
    "photometry , details of bcg identification , and so on are discussed by postman & lauer ( 1995 ) .",
    "velocities are given in the cmb , lg , and ac frames ( see lauer & postman 1994 ) .",
    "the velocities are a weighted average of all galaxies selected to be within the given abell cluster ; the estimated velocity error is 184 km s@xmath4 ( see postman & lauer 1995 ) .",

    "the galaxies were centered in the high - resolution pc1 chip . while suitable data were obtained in the flanking wfc ccds ,",
    "we chose to analyze the pc data only , given its superior resolution , and the greater brightness of the central portions of the bcg with respect to the sky .",
    "at the bcg distances , the apparent luminosity of an f814w sbf `` star , '' 8bar , is extremely faint , thus long exposures are required ; the total exposures are given in table [ tabsamp ] .",
    "although our ideal criterion is to obtain at least five photons per 8bar star , our data contained only 2.33.8 photons per 8bar .",
    "the reasons for the shortfall were 1 ) _ hst _ was 5%  less sensitive through f814w than prelaunch numbers suggested , 2 ) the galaxies were about 5%  more distant than we had guessed from their redshifts , and 3 ) 8bar  was significantly fainter ( 0.65 mag in the case of a262 ) because the galaxies were redder than anticipated and 8bar was more sensitive to color than our assumptions .",
    "nevertheless , all four galaxies yielded a strong sbf signal that could be accurately determined .",
    "because compact artifacts can strongly affect the sbf power spectrum , we built the total exposures from sets of `` dithered '' half - orbit images to eliminate hot - pixels , ccd defects , as well as cosmic - ray hits .",
    "each individual exposure was typically 1200s long , with the actual exposure time set to maximize the total exposure obtained with two roughly equal exposures per orbit . the dither pattern consisted of moving the telescope between exposures in a skewed - square - spiral pattern , designed to achieve integral - pixel shifts in the wfc ccds .",
    "the pattern optimized removal of fixed - pattern ccd defects , while preserving the exact shape of any sbf pattern from exposure to exposure .",
    "while one might argue for an approach that would instead optimize information recovered with sub - pixel stepping , we did not have the exposure time available to obtain an equal number of the required @xmath33 0.5-pixel steps and were concerned with the effects on the sbf pattern from any _ ad hoc _ interpolation scheme that might be required to assemble the completed image from a random set of offsets .",
    "ironically , we did not use the wfc images in the present analysis , given the excellent quality and superior resolution of the pc1 images ; however , this was a decision made after the data were in hand .",
    "in the dither pattern , each exposure would be shifted from the previous one , by @xmath34 wfc pixels ( @xmath35 ) in either the row or column direction , spiraling around the original pointing , with the exact shift adjusted by @xmath36 wfc pixel to avoid having any object land on the same row or column that it may have fallen on in a previous exposure .",
    "this latter criterion also meant that the exposure was simultaneously stepped @xmath36 pixel in a direction perpendicular to the major step , resulting in the spiral being skewed from perfect alignment with wfc row and column axes .",
    "the detailed shifts in all cases reflected the slight misalignment of the wfc ccds with respect to perfect quadrature with the _ hst _ sky axes ( see holtzman et al .",
    "1995b ) .",
    "integral pixel offsets for the wfc produce non - integral steps in pc1 , but for f814w , the pc1 images are nearly nyquist - sampled , so shifting the images to a common center may be done with little error . as it is , however , we chose to stack the pc1 images with centering only to the nearest pixel to avoid the complexity of patching in the defects prior to interpolation .",
    "while this produces a slight blurring at the one - pixel scale , this has little effect on measurement of the sbf signal , because the final composite image remains photon shot - noise limited at the highest - spatial frequencies .",
    "this can be simply understood by considering the enclosed energy curve of the psf .",
    "holtzman et al . ( 1995b ) show that only 32%  of the light within the f814w psf falls within its central core , corresponding to only a single photon for the typical exposure time in the present work .",
    "the final composite pc1 images were assembled with an algorithm that looks at the statistical properties of the data set at any pixel location , and rejects extreme values as might be caused by cosmic ray hits or hot pixels .",
    "the bcg images are shown in figures [ bcgpic1 ] to [ bcgpic4 ] , with the galaxies themselves largely subtracted to emphasize fine detail .",
    "globular clusters are readily visible into the centers of all images .",
    "this is the strength of using _ hst _ for sbf work  globulars , background galaxies , and dust clouds are easily recognized and excluded when measuring the sbf power spectrum .",
    "dust clouds are also visible in three galaxies , a262 , a3560 , and a3565 ; indeed , their centers are completely or nearly obscured by dust .",
    "although sbf are measured from the pc1 images , we do need the wfc images to measure the sky levels , which are required as part of the analysis .",
    "sky levels were measured from a @xmath37 patch extracted from the far corner of wf3 .",
    "this is the corner of wf3 diagonally opposite the wfpc2 vertex , and is thus the portion of the wfpc2 field most distant from the bcg centers ; the typical displacement of the sky patch from the galaxy centers is @xmath38 the galaxies still contribute light to the sky measurements at this modest distance ; however , their contribution to the sky is readily estimated and corrected for using ground - based surface photometry extending to much larger radii .",

    "measurement of the fluctuation signal was straightforward , following the steps detailed in tonry et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and ajhar et al .",
    "once the pc images were cleaned of cosmic rays and stacked , we subtracted sky ; fitted elliptical profiles to the galaxy light ; generated and subtracted a synthetic galaxy ; ran dophot ( schechter et al . 1993 ) to detect stars , globular clusters , and background galaxies ; determined a luminosity function of these objects and created a mask for removing objects brighter than a completeness cutoff ; and then performed the fluctuation analysis .",
    "the basic step in measuring fluctuations is to model the object s power spectrum as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a constant giving the background level , and @xmath63 is another constant used to scale the power spectrum of the psf , @xmath64 ( properly speaking , @xmath65 is an expectation power spectrum that incorporates the galaxy profile and the mask that has been applied to the data . )",
    "there are several sources of uncertainty in deriving the fluctuation power .",
    "the first is the normalization and match of the psf to the data .",
    "the second arises in fitting the power spectrum : the lowest wavenumbers are always corrupted , but there is no fluctuation signal at high wavenumbers , so the choice of precisely which wavenumbers to fit introduces uncertainty .",
    "finally , the raw @xmath63 variance is corrected for the variance from residual , undetected point sources , and this correction also carries an error .",
    "we used the same psf as ajhar et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , which was constructed from several f814w star images obtained in 1995 .",
    "the wings of the psf were provided by archive exposures of stars centered in pc1 to provide routine monitoring of the f814w filter zero point calibration .",
    "the core of the psf was constructed from four pc1 images of the quadrupole gravitational lens 2237 + 0305 , which were dithered in a @xmath33 pattern of 0.5 pc pixel steps .",
    "this data set allowed the core to be recovered with `` perfect '' centering on a pc pixel .",
    "the composite psf has a total exposure of @xmath66 photons .",
    "it is an excellent match to the observed power spectra of the galaxies with the highest signal to noise , a3560 and a3565 , over the wavenumbers where sbf dominates , so we deemed it to be suitable for all our observations .",
    "we performed experiments with synthetic psf images ( created by software developed by jah ) with calibrated amounts of defocus and miscentering .",
    "we found that the results are completely insensitive to where the psf was centered , but that @xmath63 became larger as the psf became defocussed , as would be expected from its more compact power spectrum . using a psf from the extreme secondary displacement caused by `` breathing '' of the ota quoted by stsci , we found that  brightened by about 0.3 mag . a synthetic psf with perfect focus gave nearly the same results as the observed psf , but was still about 0.1 mag brighter , revealing a bit _ less _ high wavenumber power than the observed psf .",
    "ajhar et al .",
    "also demonstrate that the observed psf will give very consistent results applied to a variety of observations , and indeed , we are working differentially with respect to those results anyway .",
    "we thus conclude that the observed psf is appropriate to use for the fluctuation analysis , with mismatch and normalization error amounting to about 0.05 mag .",
    "an observed power spectrum always has excess power at wavenumbers below 10 or so ( wavelengths longer than @xmath67 pixels ) , arising from poor flattening , poor galaxy subtraction , dust , etc . with the exception of a262 we found very good agreement with the psf beyond these contaminated wavenumbers .",
    "we normally use the rms variation in @xmath63 as a function of where we begin the power spectrum fit as an additional error component . in the case of a262",
    "there is a range of @xmath63 values that are allowed by the power spectrum ; this range is reflected in the larger error budget for this galaxy .",
    "psf fits to the power spectra of the bcg are shown in figure [ sbfpow ] .",
    "the contribution from the residual point sources was small  always less than a 0.20 mag correction to @xmath63 , and more typically 0.10 mag .",
    "since we think we know this variance contribution quite well , at least to 25% , the contributed error is small . as a test of this",
    ", we routinely analyze different annuli independently , and except for a262 we used 4 annuli at 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8  mean radius ( the central annulus was obscured by dust for a262 ) .",
    "if we have an error in the residual point source correction ( or an unknown source of variance which does not scale with galaxy brightness ) it will show up as a radial gradient in .",
    "a3560 had a gradient of about 0.1 mag in each of the outer annuli , but the other three had no gradient at the 0.05 mag level , giving us confidence that we have modeled the residual variance well and we have no unforeseen source of variance .",
    "the gradient in a3560 may very well be real ; there is a 0.04 mag color gradient in @xmath68 from the center to @xmath69 in radius , which would produce a gradient in  consistent with what we see .",
    "the estimates and errors for  are derived from the averages of the values determined for each annulus , and the formal uncertainty in the @xmath63 fitting procedure added in quadrature to 0.05 magnitude for the psf uncertainty . with the exception of a3560 , where we think we see a real gradient in , the scatter between the different annuli is consistent with the error estimates .",
    "we list the apparent sbf 8bar fluxes in table [ tabsbf ] uncorrected for extinction and prior to k - correction . the sbf signal strength in electrons",
    "is also given .",
    "a262 has the weakest sbf signal , which is reflected in its larger error bars .      as discussed above",

    "_ 1995 ) and applying an uncertainty of 0.1  mag , yields an estimate of @xmath86 , also in good agreement with the bcg value .",
    "the present data set permits two separate approaches to measuring @xmath11 the first and most obvious approach is simply to form hubble ratios for the four bcg and average them in an optimal way .",
    "the bcg all have velocities in excess of 4,000 km s@xmath4 ( in the cmb frame ) , and may be far enough away so that their average hubble ratio might be close to the true value of @xmath11 at the same time , this approach does not make use of the bcg hubble diagram , nor does it transfer the results to the 15,000 km s@xmath4 far - field .",
    "the bcg instead are simply treated as test particles , without reference to their photometric properties ( although we do use cluster averages for the velocities ) .",
    "the second approach is to use the bcg as distance estimators to avoid any use of the velocities of the four sbf bcg themselves , in an effort to skip over the near velocity field  this is the approach promised by the title of our paper .",
    "the frame independence of both the bcg hubble diagram and @xmath17 relationship argues that we can successfully reduce the bcg to a common distance .",
    "the sbf distances then permit calibration of the bcg as absolute rather than relative distance estimators .    in either approach , the mathematical formalism used to derive",

    ", we compute a distance measurement in mpc , @xmath87 , from the expression @xmath88 where 8bar and 8bar are corrected for extinction and k - dimming .",
    "the hubble ratio is then just @xmath89 where @xmath90 is either the observed velocity of the bcg in the appropriate reference frame ( for the first approach ) or the estimated velocity of the bcg using the prescription in postman & lauer ( 1995 ) and summarized in  3.2 ( for the second approach ) .      the bcg @xmath53 colors and the f814w sbf calibration of equation [ eqm8bar ] allow us to predict the absolute fluctuation magnitude 8bar . using a 8bar  k - correction of @xmath91 ( tonry et al .",

    "the errors listed here include the estimated velocity error of 184 km s@xmath4 plus a nominal 100 km s@xmath4 allowance for peculiar velocity with respect to the local velocity field ( added in quadrature ) , although this term could plausibly be as large as 5% .",
    "there is no allowance for bulk flow since we are explicitly trying to remove this by examining different reference frames .",
    "the average hubble ratios are the weighted logarithmic averages , and the errors are those expected given the individual distance errors .",
    "while this sample is too small to solve for a preferred reference frame at 4,000 km s@xmath4 , we do see the insensitivity of the average hubble ratio among the three frames because of the sampling over the sky .",
    "it is also apparent that @xmath92 prefers the cmb frame to the local group or abell cluster frame , but again the numbers are small . because these sbf distances appear to be extremely consistent and accurate , a larger sample observed by _",
    "hst _ throughout the sky could give a precise measure of peculiar velocities ; we discuss this issue further in @xmath93 our preferred value for @xmath6 is derived from the cmb frame since it has the lowest value of @xmath92 : @xmath94 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath95 the error is discussed in detail below .",
    "the premise behind seeking the far - field is that the near - field may be strongly affected by random peculiar velocities or bulk flows .",
    "one measures distances in the near - field , but avoids using the corresponding near - field velocities by forming distance ratios between near and far objects , and then forming a hubble ratio based purely on the far velocities .",
    "the classic example of this approach is using the distance to the nearby virgo cluster , but adopting the velocity of the much more distant coma cluster by finding the ratio of the virgo to coma distance from some form of relative distance estimator , such as the @xmath12 method .    in the present case ,",
    "the transference to the far field is somewhat less obvious as we are not making an explicit comparison of the four sbf bcg to , say , the most distant bcg in the lauer & postman ( 1994 ) sample at 15,000 km s@xmath13 instead , we will implicitly compare the sbf bcg to the entire lauer & postman sample on the presumption that all bcg can be transferred to a common distance based on their observed velocities and a simple linear hubble flow model .",
    "one can add a bulk flow to this model , but in the end , this makes little difference , as we discuss below .",
    "the bcg @xmath17 distance estimator presented in lauer & postman ( 1992 , 1994 ) and postman & lauer ( 1995 ) , indeed is based on comparing the physical properties of bcg after adopting a linear hubble flow and an _ ad hoc _ @xmath11 the @xmath17 relation works by allowing @xmath96 to be predicted based on @xmath97 as measured at the metric radius @xmath98 the scatter in @xmath96 is 0.24 mag , which translates into a typical distance error of @xmath99 this is larger than the error expected for a pure inverse - square distance estimator , as an error in the metric radius also implies an error in the apparent luminosity within the metric radius ( gunn & oke 1975 ) .",
    "the @xmath17 relation is equivalent to assuming that bcg all have the same average enclosed surface brightness as a function of physical radius for a given value of @xmath100 postman & lauer ( 1995 ) showed that they could estimate bcg redshifts ( that is a relative distance expressed as a velocity ) to 17% accuracy from a surface brightness curve of growth by finding the angular aperture at which the enclosed surface brightness and @xmath97 were consistent with the @xmath17 relationship , then using the aperture size as a metric distance estimator .",
    "figure [ zest ] shows the plot of estimated versus observed redshift presented by postman & lauer ( 1995 ) . the estimated redshift results from calculating the velocity required to bring a given bcg onto the ridge line of the @xmath17 relation .",
    "the scatter in @xmath101 thus reflects the scatter of the bcg about the ridge line .",
    "lauer & postman ( 1994 ) showed that this scatter is strongly dominated by random photometric differences between the bcg rather than random peculiar velocities or velocity errors  photometric scatter is constant with redshift , as are the residuals about the @xmath17 relationship , while the decreasing relative importance of random velocities with increasing hubble velocity would cause the scatter to decline with redshift .",
    "the estimated redshifts for the four sbf bcg ( given in table [ tabho ] ) imply the velocity scaling required to bring their photometric properties onto the @xmath17 ridge line ; hubble ratios can then be calculated , based on the sbf distances .",
    "the implied far - field hubble ratios are given in table [ tabho ] .",
    "again , the average value is best estimated with a error - weighted logarithmic average of the ratios .",
    "the far - field hubble constant implied is @xmath102 the error will be discussed in detail in the next section , but in this case it is dominated by the bcg photometric scatter about the @xmath17 relationship . in this context , it is worth noting that a262 is among the most deviant bcg with respect to its position in the @xmath17 relationship , a conclusion echoed in the highly deviant hubble ratio that it yields using its photometric redshift as the velocity ( see the last column in table [ tabho ] ) .",
    "the @xmath92 value for the far - field @xmath6 is also large .",
    "deleting a262 , yields a lower far - field @xmath103 this value is consistent with the former value , but does suggest that a more complete sampling of the nearby bcg may be an attractive way to improve the accuracy of the bcg far - field @xmath11    as the far - field @xmath6 does not explicitly depend on the velocities of the individual sbf bcg , it is explicitly independent of the velocity frame",
    ". there may be _ implicit _ dependences on frame , since different choices of hubble velocity will affect the particular placement of any given bcg within the @xmath17 relationship ; however , such effects are tiny . for example , at @xmath104 the ridge line value of @xmath96 varies by only 1% among the three frames .",
    "more to the point , the @xmath101 varies by only 2% for a262 , and less than 1% for the other bcg over the various frames .",
    "this result is not surprising , as any dipole pattern caused by a large bulk flow superimposed on the bcg recession velocities will integrate out of the @xmath17 relationship because it is defined from the full sky .",
    "a more relevant question is whether the nearby sbf bcg set may be offset from the more distant bcg by some global perturbation of the hubble flow that is limited to within , say , 5,000 km s@xmath4 or some other small fraction of the 15,000 km s@xmath4 limit of the abell cluster sample .",
    "this was the sort of problem posed by turner , cen , & ostriker ( 1992 ) and addressed by the lauer & postman ( 1992 ) bcg hubble diagram .",

    "the strong dependence of 8bar on @xmath26 puts a premium on accurate colors .",
    "we do not have multiple ground observations of the bcg , but previous experience plus the quality of the standard star solutions argues that the error in @xmath26 is likely to be close to 0.012 mag .",
    "we also include a 10%  uncertainty in @xmath107 and @xmath108%  errors in the @xmath26 and 8bar k - corrections .",
    "the final net color error gives a typical @xmath109 mag error for estimating 8bar from equation [ eqm8bar ] ; this is added in quadrature to the measurement error in 8bar given in table [ tabsbf ] to give the total random distance error .",
    "calculation of the hubble ratios also includes a 184 km s@xmath4 velocity error and 100 km s@xmath4 peculiar velocity term for the sbf - alone measures , and a 17% redshift error for the hubble diagram values , as noted above .",
    "the errors in the individual hubble ratios given in table [ tabho ] reflect the random error contributions only .",

    "the systematic error associated with the psf is 0.05 mag , as discussed in @xmath112 if we add these errors in quadrature , we get a total systematic uncertainty of 0.13 mag in predicting distances .",
    "we include no systematic error in velocity for @xmath6 estimated from the hubble diagram . for the sbf - alone",

    "indeed we find @xmath2 just from hubble ratios based on the sbf distances and observed recession velocities to the four sbf - calibrated bcg at @xmath34,000 km s@xmath4 alone , a result consistent with our far - field result .",
    "the present @xmath6 rests on calibration of the sbf method and an understanding of its systematic effects . at the fundamental level ,",
    "we are tied to the nearby cepheid calibrators .",
    "changes in the cepheid scale will propagate to the present results through the tonry et al . and ajhar et al .",
    "calibrations . as noted in the introduction , tonry et al .",
    "( 1997 ) sbf calibration is tied to seven spiral galaxies with cepheid distances .",
    "further , tonry et al . have observed enough galaxies to perform an exhaustive series of tests , finding no systematic offsets between sbf observations of bulges and elliptical galaxies .",
    "a weaker link is transferring the ground @xmath1 method to the wfpc2 f814w filter , a task accomplished by ajhar et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ; we will attempt to refine this calibration as more nearby systems are observed with _",
    "hst . _ we conclude that the major uncertainties in the distance scale are those close to home rather than far away .",
    "we thank guy worthey and barbara ryden for helpful discussions , and john blakeslee for the photometry of a262 .",
