    "a simple description for consensus in an interacting population is based on endowing each individual , or agent , with discrete opinion states that evolve by kinetics in which neighboring agents tend to agree .",
    "perhaps the best studied such example is the 2-state voter model @xcite , in which a randomly - selected agent adopts the state of one of its neighbors .",
    "this update is repeated until a finite system necessarily reaches consensus .",
    "when the densities of agents of each state are equal , the time to reach consensus in @xmath4 dimensions scales linearly in the number of agents @xmath2 for @xmath5 , as @xmath6 for @xmath7 , and as @xmath8 for @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "another classical description for consensus formation is the ising model with zero - temperature glauber kinetics @xcite . here",
    ", a randomly - picked agent adopts the state of the majority in its local interaction neighborhood ; in case of a tie , the initial agent flips with probability 1/2 .",
    "while this updating promotes agreement , consensus does not necessarily arise .",
    "in fact , the system almost always gets stuck in infinitely long - lived metastable states for spatial dimension @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "recently , another prototypical model for consensus formation , majority rule ( mr ) , was introduced @xcite . in mr ,",
    "a system consists of 2-state agents , corresponding to two distinct opinions .",
    "agents evolve by the following two steps : first , pick a group of agents with fixed odd size @xmath0 ; this group is an arbitrary set of agents in the mean - field limit , or a contiguous group for finite spatial dimension .",
    "second , all agents in this group adopt the local majority state .",
    "these two steps are repeated until consensus is reached @xcite .",
    "the mr model is analogous to the majority rule of the ising model with zero - temperature glauber kinetics , except that more than one agent can flip in a single update step .",
    "a related multi - spin kinetics occurs in the sznajd model @xcite , where a small contiguous group of same - species spins induces all spins on the group boundary to flip .",
    "a perhaps desirable feature of the mr model is that the group - based kinetics ensures that consensus is always reached in a finite system .",
    "-state system with group size @xmath11.,scaledwidth=25.0% ]    in this work , we study two natural extensions of majority rule ( fig .  [ process ] ) .",
    "the first is to allow each agent to have more than 2 equivalent states , _",
    "i.e. _ , each agent possesses a potts - like opinion variable that may be in any of @xmath1 states @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the update step is similar to that in the original mr model .",
    "a group of @xmath0 agents , with @xmath0 an odd number , is first identified .",
    "if a local majority in this group exists , that is , if @xmath13 or more agents in the group are in a single state , then all agents adopt this local majority state .",
    "however , if there is no local majority , then the group does not evolve .",
    "a new feature of the multi - state compared to the 2-state model is the possibility of static groups in which there is no local consensus . because of this feature",
    ", a finite system does not necessarily reach consensus .",
    "one of our goals will be to characterize the dynamics of mr with more than 2 states and to determine whether the final outcome is consensus or a frozen state .",
    "a second extension is plurality rule ( pr ) , which is meaningful only if the number of spin states is 3 or greater . in a single update step of pr",
    ", a group of size @xmath0 is first identified .",
    "next the state with the most representatives in that group  the plurality state  is determined .",
    "all agents in this group then adopt this plurality state . in case of a tie",
    ", the agents all adopt one of the multiple plurality states equiprobably .",
    "this type of evolution mimics how consensus might be achieved in parliamentary systems when there are more than two parties .",
    "clearly , the pr model avoids the freezing phenomenon that can occur in the multistate mr model .",
    "we will investigate how the pr model approaches consensus and the basic differences between mr and pr dynamics .    in sec .",
    "ii , we study the mr and pr models in the mean - field limit and show generically that the consensus time grows logarithmically with @xmath2 . then in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the change from diffusive domain coarsening , when the number of opinion states @xmath1 and the group size @xmath0 are small , to ballistic domain evolution , and finally to no evolution as @xmath1 and @xmath0 increase . in sec .",
    "iv , we present simulation results about the consensus time distribution for the multi - state mr model that illustrate these two regimes of behavior . in sec .",
    "v , we discuss the dynamical behavior of the pr and compare with the mr model .",
    "we conclude in sec .  vi .",
    "we begin with the mean - field solution for the 2-state mr model in the continuum @xmath14 limit .",
    "while the mean - field solution for the @xmath15-state mr model with a finite number of agents was obtained previously @xcite , the continuum solution is much simpler , while still exhibiting nearly all of the features of the discrete solution .    for simplicity , consider first the case of group size @xmath16 . in an update step ,",
    "the number of agents in state @xmath17 , @xmath18 , increases by 1 if the group state is @xmath19 , while this number of agents decreases by 1 if the group state is @xmath20 .",
    "thus @xmath21 , where @xmath17 and @xmath22 now denote the global densities of agents of each type , and the factor of 3 accounts for the 3 permutations of agents in the group .",
    "if there is local consensus in a group , then @xmath18 does not change in an update .",
    "we increment the time by @xmath23 in an update so that each agent typically flips once in a single time unit . with these preliminaries ,",
    "the rate equations for the agent densities are @xmath24    since the total density @xmath25 , we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ rate2 ] ) as @xmath26 in the latter form , we see that @xmath27 are stable fixed points , while @xmath28 is unstable . thus starting from any @xmath29 ,",
    "the system is quickly driven to consensus because of the non - zero bias inherent in eq .",
    "( [ rate-1 ] ) .",
    "the existence of a bias contrasts with the voter model , where the average magnetization is conserved @xcite , and purely diffusive dynamics governs the evolution .    to determine the time until consensus is reached , we rewrite eq .",

    "there are 7 such points ; a globally unstable fixed point at @xmath53 , three saddle points @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , and 3 stable points @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 ( fig .  [ triangle ] ) .",

    "[ triangle ] .",

    "similarly , the time to go from @xmath68 to @xmath73 asymptotically scales as @xmath74 . thus the total time to go from @xmath75 to consensus",

    "following the same line of reasoning , the consensus time from @xmath75 to @xmath77 directly along the path where @xmath78 always , asymptotically scales as @xmath79 .",

    "the rate equations ( [ rate3 ] ) become @xmath80 plus cyclic permutations . here",
    "@xmath81 now denotes the density of the @xmath82 species .",
    "again , we compute the consensus time along a sequential path in which one species disappears first while the remaining species have equal densities , as well as along a direct path in which @xmath83 species have equal densities that all go to zero simultaneously .    for the first leg of the sequential path , the densities satisfy the conditions @xmath84 and @xmath85 . then eq .",
    "( [ rate - s ] ) reduces to @xmath86 integrating from the unstable fixed point to the fixed point where the density of one species is zero , the transit time equals @xmath87 . repeating this calculation as each species",

    "if species are eliminated one by one , the coefficient grows quadratically with @xmath1 , while if one species dominates and the remaining @xmath83 all disappear at the same rate , the coefficient grows linearly with @xmath1 .",
    "qualitatively similar results arise for larger group sizes .      finally , we study plurality rule ( pr ) which first becomes distinct from mr when number of states @xmath93 and the group size @xmath94 .",

    "( [ rate - mr ] ) except that the last two terms , corresponding to states with no global majority , are absent .",

    "let us now determine the transit time from @xmath100 along the path @xmath69 for the case @xmath95 for both the pr and mr models . using @xmath69 and @xmath70 ,",
    "the rate equation for @xmath101 reduces to @xmath102 to determine the transit time simply , note that the driving flow in the rate equation vanishes linearly near the fixed points and that the coefficient of the linear dependence determines the coefficient of @xmath3 in the transit time .",
    "we thereby find @xmath103 for pr , while @xmath104 for mr .",
    "as expected , pr evolves faster than mr because there are fewer possibilities for frozen groups .",
    "finally , to reach consensus via @xmath105 , the rate equations for both the pr and mr models are @xmath106 , so that the time to go from @xmath68 to @xmath73 is @xmath107 .",
    "thus the consensus time from @xmath67 is @xmath108 for pr and @xmath109 for mr .",
    "thus there is only a quantitative difference between the pr and mr models in the mean - field limit .",
    "we now investigate the multi - state mr model on the square lattice . while the rate equations predict that the number of states and the group size do not qualitatively affect the evolution , simulations on the square lattice show very different behaviors for systems with small @xmath1 and/or @xmath0 and those with large @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( figs .",

    "as the number of states is increased , the consensus time distribution in pr continues to be described by two distinct time scales .",
    "an example for the case of the @xmath142 pr model is shown in fig .",
    "[ pdf2_pr ] , whose behavior strongly contrasts that of the @xmath142 mr model ( bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ pdf2 ] ) .",
    "a final feature worth noting is that the characteristic time scales decrease with @xmath0 , reflecting the fact that larger groups necessarily lead to quicker consensus formation .",
    "we studied two extensions of the 2-state majority rule ( mr ) model for consensus formation , namely , multi - state majority rule ( mr ) and plurality rule . in the mean - field limit , both these models reach consensus in a time that grows logarithmically with the number of agents @xmath2 .",
    "variations in the microscopic evolution rules , such as majority or plurality rule , the number of spin states @xmath1 , and the group size @xmath0 , merely lead to a quantitative difference in the amplitude of @xmath3 in the consensus time .    for finite spatial dimension , the mr model has two distinct regimes of behavior that are delineated by the relative values of @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath2 . for small @xmath1 or small @xmath0 , many groups have local majorities in a typical initial state .",
    "these groups are the nuclei of domains whose long - time dynamics is governed by diffusive coarsening . for this range of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , the multi - state mr model thus evolves in a manner similar to that in the @xmath15-state mr model .",
    "the distribution of consensus times has two widely separated time scales  the most probable consensus time and the asymptotic decay time of the consensus time distribution .",
    "the dependences of these two time scales on @xmath2 is quite close to those in the 2-state mr model .    on the other hand , for sufficiently large @xmath1 and @xmath0",
    ", it becomes prohibitively unlikely that a finite system will contain even a initial single group with a local majority .",
    "thus essentially all realizations of the system are frozen . as the boundary between these two regimes",
    "is approached , a typical realization will contain either zero or one initial group with a local majority . in the latter case ,",
    "this domain quickly imposes its state on the entire system .",
    "this phenomenon has a number of unfortunate historical examples , such as germany in 1933 , italy in 1922 , and russia in 1917 , where a well - organized , extremist , and initially minority party ultimately imposed its will upon a deadlocked political system .",
    "we also investigated the dynamics of plurality rule ( pr ) , where a group adopts the state of its plurality members in an update event . in the mean - field limit , pr and mr were observed to have qualitatively similar behavior . for finite spatial dimension , however , all groups in pr are active",
    ". thus the evolution of the system for any @xmath1 and @xmath0 is qualitatively similar to that of mr in which the number of states and the group size is small .",
    "as one should expect , a voting system based on plurality rule facilitates the achievement of ultimate consensus ."
