    "+ 2em transitions between energy levels in a two energy level system evolving in time are of great importance from many points of view .",
    "on one side such systems provide us with the simplest models to investigate transition amplitudes between different energy levels by different approaches @xcite . on the other side these systems play an important role in experimental investigations of basic principles of quantum mechanics @xcite . recently a lot of effort has been devoted to obtain more rigorous results on the adiabatic limit of transition amplitudes for these systems @xcite .",
    "in particular in a series of recent papers joye have studied this problem by the hilbert space methods .",
    "such two energy level systems are formally equivalent to a one - half spin system put into time dependent magnetic field",
    ". however good approximate results and the more so the exact ones are difficult to obtain for such systems even for simple time evolutions of the effective magnetic field .",
    "therefore each opportunity of improving this situation is worth trying .",
    "a treatment of the problem by a method of fundamental solutions ( so fruitful in its application to stationary problems of 1-dim schrdinger equation @xcite ) is of first importance , the more so that to our knowledge , the method was not used so far to this goal .",
    "a possibility of application of the method is related to the fact that a linear system of first order differential equations describing time evolution of transition amplitudes can always be transformed into a system of decoupled second order equations having a form of the stationary schrdinger equation , one for each amplitude .",
    "this allows us to apply all advantages of the fundamental solution method @xcite .",
    "the only obstacle related with this approach is a complexity of effective potentials which appear in the final system of the schrdinger - type equations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in the next section the problem of transitions in two energy level systems",
    "is stated and corresponding assumptions about the effective magnetic field are formulated .",
    "a linear system of two differential equations for the transition amplitudes is rewritten in a form of two decoupled equations of the schrdinger type .    in sec .",
    "3 properties of the fundamental solution method are recalled .    in sec.4",
    "some subtleties of the application of the fundamental solution method to the problems considered in the paper are discussed .",
    "the method is first applied to a particular system of the atom - atom scattering within a frame of the nikitin model @xcite in sec.5 .    in sec.6 results of sec.5",
    "are next generalized to systems with an algebraic time dependence of the effective magnetic field .    in sec.7 another two examples of two energy level systems",
    "are considered with corresponding magnetic fields depending exponentially on time .",
    "these examples show that a way the magnetic fields depend on time does not affect a form of the transition amplitudes .",
    "this form is not affected either by the number of ( complex ) energy level crossings on the stokes lines closest to the real axis of the complex time plane .",
    "the latter result confirms the one of the previous section .",
    "such a dependence resulting with some interference effects has been announced by joye @xcite .",
    "in sec.8 we consider an example of the magnetic field with an explicit contribution of the geometrical ( berry ) phase to the transition probability .",
    "we summarize and discuss our results in the last section .",
    "in particular we show there that the results of joye , mileti and pfister [ 4 ] on the effects of interference from many level crossings are incorrect .",
    "+ 2em in general , any two energy level system is formally equivalent to a one - half spin system put into an external magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , we shall consider just such a system .",
    "its hamiltonian @xmath3 is given then by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 are pauli s matrices so that two energy levels @xmath6 of @xmath3 are given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "when the adiabatic transitions between the two energy levels @xmath6 are considered then the following properties of the field @xmath9 are typically assumed to be :    @xmath10 @xmath9 is real being defined for the real @xmath11 , @xmath12 ;    @xmath13 @xmath9 can be continued analytically off the real values of @xmath11 as a meromorphic function defined on some @xmath11-riemann surface @xmath14 .",
    "a sheet of @xmath14 from which @xmath9 is originally continued is called physical ;    @xmath15 on the physical sheet @xmath9 is analytic in an infinite strip @xmath16 , without roots in the strip and achieves there finite limits for @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 in the strip ;    the field @xmath9 depends additionally on a parameter @xmath19 i.e. @xmath20 which introduces a `` natural '' scale of time to the system , so that its time evolution is expressed most naturally in units of @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath21 is small in comparison with the actual period of the process considered then the latter is `` fast '' or `` sudden '' .",
    "if , however , @xmath21 is large in this comparison then the process is `` slow '' or `` adiabatic '' .    in the adiabatic process of the system",
    "the following is assumed about @xmath22 :    @xmath23 a dependence of @xmath22 on @xmath21 is such that a rescaled field @xmath24 has the following asymptotic behavior for @xmath25 @xmath26 while its @xmath27-riemann surface @xmath28 approaches smoothly the topological structure of the riemann surface corresponding to the first term @xmath29 of the expansion ( [ 2.1 ] ) .    @xmath30 with respect to its dependence on @xmath27 the field @xmath29 satisfies properties @xmath31 above with substitutions @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    note that condition @xmath15 excludes periodic fields @xmath9 .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation induced by @xmath3 takes therefore a form @xmath34    the adiabatic regime of evolution of the wave function @xmath35 corresponds now to taking a limit @xmath25 in ( [ 2.2 ] ) .",
    "the main problem of the adiabatic limit in the considered case is to find in this limit the transition amplitude between the two energy levels of the system for @xmath36 under the assumptions that @xmath37 coincides with one of the two possible eigenstates @xmath38 of @xmath39 and that there is no level crossing for real @xmath11 i.e. @xmath40 .",
    "known approximate solutions of this problem are that of landau @xcite and zener @xcite in a form of the so called landau - zener formula and that of dykhne @xcite who have shown that such an amplitude should be exponentially small in the limit @xmath25 . in the next sections",
    "we shall show how to get an exact ( i.e. not approximate ) result for this amplitude as well as its adiabatic limit with the help of the fundamental solutions .    a typical way of proceeding when the adiabatic limit is investigated is using eigenvectors @xmath41 of @xmath42 satisfying @xmath43 .",

    "the structure of @xmath70 can turn out to be much simpler in this limit . despite this supposed complexity of @xmath64 and of their riemann surfaces we shall introduce and discuss the fundamental solutions to the equations ( [ 2.9 ] ) without simplifications",
    ". we shall do it for the @xmath59 case of ( [ 2.12 ] ) .",
    "an extension of the discussion to the @xmath62 case will be obvious .",
    "a standard way of introducing the fundamental solutions is a construction of a stokes graph @xcite related to a given @xmath59 .",

    "( otherwise the corresponding @xmath79-term is put to zero ) .",

    "the stokes graph corresponding to the function @xmath80 consists now of stokes lines emerging from roots ( turning points ) of @xmath80 .",
    "stokes lines satisfy one of the following equations : @xmath81 with @xmath82 being a root of @xmath80 .",
    "we shall assume further a generic situation when all the roots @xmath82 are simple .",
    "stokes lines which are not closed end at these points of @xmath75 ( i.e. have the latter points as their boundaries ) for which the action integral in ( [ 3.2 ] ) becomes infinite . of course such points are singular for @xmath80 and they can be its finite poles or its poles lying at an infinity .",
    "each such a singularity @xmath83 of @xmath80 defines a domain called a sector .",
    "this is the connected domain of @xmath75 bounded by stokes lines and @xmath83 itself .",

    "the langer @xmath79-term appearing in ( [ 3.1 ] ) and ( [ 3.5 ] ) is necessary to ensure all the integrals in ( [ 3.4 ] ) to converge when @xmath83 is a first or a second order pole of @xmath90 or when the solutions ( [ 3.3 ] ) are to be continued to such poles . as it follows from ( [ 3.5",
    "] ) each such pole @xmath83 demands a contribution to @xmath97 of the form @xmath98 , what has been already assumed in the corresponding construction of @xmath97 .",
    "+ 2em consider now the consequences of taking the large-@xmath21 limit for the above description .",
    "we assume that for a given @xmath80 and its riemann surface @xmath75 the corresponding stokes graph @xmath99 is drawn .",
    "it is drawn , of course , on the riemann surface @xmath100 corresponding to @xmath101 .",
    "first let us notice that singular points of @xmath80 such as its branch points and poles depend in general on @xmath21 .",
    "for both kinds of these singularities this also means a dependence on @xmath21 of jumps of @xmath80 on its cuts as well as the @xmath21-dependence of coefficients of its poles .    according to the property @xmath23 of the magnetic field @xmath67 ( see sec .",
    "2 ) we can expect that the singular structure of @xmath80 , i.e. positions of its roots and poles , as well as the cut jumps and pole coefficients , change smoothly in this limit to their final positions and values respectively .",
    "this limit structure is defined by the singularity structure of @xmath102 ( see expansion ( [ 2.13 ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , both the topology of @xmath100 and the associated stokes graph @xmath99 change accordingly to coincide eventually with the riemann surface @xmath103 and with the stokes graph @xmath104 corresponding to @xmath105 .",
    "this limit structure can be achieved in the following ways :    * a*. some of branch points and poles of @xmath80 escape to infinities of @xmath75 ;    * b*. some of branch points and poles of @xmath80 approach the respective singularities of @xmath102 ;    * c*. some of branch points and poles of @xmath80 disappear because their respective jumps and coefficients vanish in the limit @xmath106 .",
    "being more specific we expect that for @xmath21 large enough a set @xmath107 of all singular points of @xmath80 ( i.e. containing all its branch points and poles ) consists of three well separated subsets @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the points of @xmath108 run to infinities of @xmath75 when @xmath25 .",
    "those of @xmath109 disappear in this limit while those of @xmath110 coincide in this limit with the set @xmath111 of the singular points of @xmath102 .",
    "let us remove the points contained in @xmath112 from the riemann surface @xmath75 , i.e. let us consider these points as regular for @xmath80 .",
    "then @xmath75 will transform into @xmath113 - a riemann surface which singular points coincide with those of the set @xmath110 .    together with the previous operation",
    "let us remove from @xmath100 also the stokes lines generated by the points of @xmath112 so that the remaining stokes lines can be uniquely continued to form the stokes graph @xmath114 generated by the set @xmath115 .",
    "it is clear that the graph @xmath114 coincides with @xmath104 in the limit @xmath25 .",
    "the above two operations will be called the adiabatic limit reduction or simply the reduction operation .    as we have mentioned earlier",
    "there is a set of sectors and a corresponding set of fundamental solutions defined in them associated with the graph @xmath99 . by the reduction operation",
    "both sets can be reduced i.e. under this operation some sectors of @xmath99 transform into corresponding sectors of @xmath114 whereas the others disappear . obviously , the latter sectors are those which disappear when the limit @xmath25 is taken",
    ".    the following assumption should stabilize the corresponding results obtained with the help of the fundamental solution method .",
    "@xmath116 among a full set of fundamental solutions associated with the stokes graph @xmath99 there is a subset of them associated with graph @xmath114 which allows us to solve the basic problem of the adiabatic transition and which is invariant under the reduction operation .",
    "the dynamical systems described by the hamiltonian @xmath3 satisfying assumption @xmath116 will be called the adiabatic limit reducible ( alr-)systems .",
    "the above assumption means that to solve the problem of the adiabatic transitions in the alr - system we can first perform the reduction operation and next work with the simplified stokes graphs @xmath114 .",
    "a set of fundamental solutions associated with this graph which can be used to solve the problem considered coincide with the corresponding ones of the full graph @xmath99 .",
    "the procedure used to construct a solution of the problem with the help of the latter graph is not affected by the reduction operation , i.e. it looks the same when the simplified graph @xmath114 is used instead of @xmath99 .",
    "therefore the aim of the reduction operation is to make easier choosing the proper set of fundamental solution solving the problem .",
    "the results obtained in this way can be still exact if the integration paths taken on the graph @xmath114 can be mapped properly on the stokes graph @xmath99 restoring in this way the exact condition of the problem .",
    "however , if such a map is not known or is difficult to construct ( because of the complicated structure of graph @xmath99 ) the result obtained in this way can be considered only as an approximation i.e. valid only in the limit @xmath117 .    according to the above assumptions we can conclude from ( [ 2.12 ] ) and ( [ 2.13 ] ) that there is one - to - one correspondence between the stokes graphs @xmath99 and @xmath104 and the corresponding sets @xmath115 and @xmath111 .",
    "namely , this correspondence is built by aggregations ( blobs ) of singular points of @xmath115 , i.e. the branch points and poles of @xmath80 , which are transformed into single points of @xmath111 when the limit @xmath117 is taken .",
    "also there are sheaves of stokes lines of @xmath114 emerging from the blobs and transformed into single lines of @xmath104 in the same limit .    therefore in the limit @xmath117 we can eventually consider for potentials ( [ 2.12 ] ) stokes graphs corresponding to first terms @xmath118 of the asymptotic expansions for @xmath64 .",
    "the first terms of the asymptotic expansions corresponding to @xmath118 and @xmath64 are the same in this limit and equal , according to ( [ 2.1 ] ) , to @xmath119 .",
    "let us note that properties @xmath120 above can be satisfied by the field @xmath67 for which @xmath121 is a @xmath122 function of @xmath11 .",
    "we shall assume just such a dependence of @xmath67 on @xmath11 and of the corresponding rescaled field @xmath24 on @xmath27 .",
    "however , for simplicity , instead of continuing our considerations in their most general form we shall investigate first a particular example of the field @xmath22 which , as it seems to us , will illustrate our method in a satisfactory way .",

    "namely , for this case we have : @xmath165    from ( [ 8.1 ] ) it follows easily that for this case the transition probability ( [ 6.7 ] ) takes the form @xmath166    it is the second term of ( [ 8.2 ] ) which is responsible for the berry phase contribution to the transition probability ( [ 8.3 ] ) .",
    "we shall calculate this contribution in the adiabatic limit only and for @xmath167 close to @xmath168 .",
    "this assumption allows us to calculate the corresponding path integral : @xmath169 from point @xmath145 to the closest root @xmath170 of the polynomial @xmath171 , lying in the second quadrant of the @xmath27-plane . for @xmath167 close to @xmath168 we can simplify the integration expanding suitably the square root in the integrand of ( [ 8.4 ] ) and the root @xmath172 as well .",
    "it is easy to check that under the above assumptions the net result of such calculations is : @xmath173    obviously ,",
    "the above berry phase contribution to the transition probability ( [ 8.3 ] ) modifies its prexponential factor multiplying it by the following additional one : @xmath174",
    "+ 2em we have shown in this paper that the fundamental solution method has turned out to be very effective also in its application to the problems of the transition amplitudes in two energy level systems .",
    "in particular it has enabled us to obtain compact and exact formulae for these amplitudes and to get easily their adiabatic approximations as well . due the clear way of their obtaining and their compact forms ,",
    "the formulae allow us to claim that there are no particular effects coming out of the many complex level crossings i.e. there are no of individual contributions of any kind to the transition amplitude from each such crossing leading to any particular interference effects in these amplitudes .",
    "just the opposite , such a contribution is controlled totally by the stokes line closest to the real axis of the @xmath11-plane which is however built by these crossing points of the two energy levels .",
    "this result is independent of both the number of complex level crossings ( i.e. finite or infinite ) and of the particular type of the @xmath11-dependence of the effective magnetic field ( i.e. algebraic or exponential ) . in this way",
    "the respective results of joye , mileti and pfister [ 4 ] have not been confirmed by our approach .",
    "this last difference seems to be rather dramatic and , as it seems to us , its origin lies in an erroneous calculation of the transition amplitude by the authors mentioned .",
    "namely , it is the formula ( 6.21 ) of their paper [ 4 ] for the transition matrix @xmath175 which is wrong , particularly if applied further in their _ lemma 6.1 _ to get the general formula of it .",
    "this can be seen if we rewrite our results in terms of the transition matrix .",
    "namely , let us denote the r.h.s . of the formula ( 28 ) by @xmath176 and the result",
    "we obtain calculating @xmath177 with the help of the second of eqs.(5 ) and of ( 28 ) by @xmath178 .    reversing the problem we have solved in our paper by assuming that for @xmath179 the vanishing amplitude is rather @xmath177 than @xmath180 we obtain by exactly the same methods as used in sec.3 and the further ones the remaining elements @xmath181 and @xmath182 which construct the transition matrix @xmath183 . for the choice we have done in our paper we have of course : @xmath184=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}u_{11}(s ,",
    "t)&u_{12}(s , t)\\\\u_{21}(s , t)&u_{22}(s , t)\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\0\\end{array}\\right ] \\label{9.1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    matrix @xmath183 is of course unitary ( for real @xmath27 ) and @xmath185 .",
    "it should be clear that the order of @xmath181 as a function of its arguments is the _ same _ as that of @xmath176 , the latter element being given by the r.h.s .",
    "of ( 28 ) so that the adiabatic limit of @xmath183 is given by : @xmath186 \\label{9.2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    therefore this matrix is _ not _ a triangular one in this limit , as it is the case of @xmath175 mentioned earlier , which does _ not _ contain the _ non vanishing _ element @xmath187",
    ".    moreover we can not apply matrix @xmath188 directly to continue the solution ( [ 9.1 ] ) along the central strip of the corresponding stokes graph from point @xmath27 to another one @xmath48 .",
    "the proper continuation is of course the following : @xmath189    in particular , if it is possible to continue the solution @xmath190 along , say , the upper stokes line limiting the central strip ( i.e the level crossings @xmath191 met along this line are not an obstacle to such a continuation ) then continuing @xmath190 in this way to @xmath192 we get : @xmath193=   { \\bf    u}(+\\infty , t)\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\0\\end{array}\\right]\\nn\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the above results show that _ none _ of the contributions from the _ individual _ level crossings lying on the considered stokes line survive on the way of continuation .",
    "on the other hand writing both formula ( 6.21 ) and the respective result of _ lemma 6.1 _ of [ 4 ] in terms of the quantities introduced above , we get : @xmath194 \\label{9.5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath195 \\label{9.6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    comparing the last two formulas with the respective ( [ 9.2 ] ) and ( [ 9.4 ] ) ones we see that formulas ( [ 9.5 ] ) and ( [ 9.6 ] ) are wrong .",
    "particularly , it is the incorrect formula ( [ 9.6 ] ) which gives rise to the interference effects in the amplitudes of joye , mileti and pfister [ 4 ] .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that , as we have shown this in sec.8 there are contributions to the transition probabilities originating from the geometrical ( berry ) phase [ 16 ] although their geometrical meaning in the context of the transition amplitudes is not clear .",
