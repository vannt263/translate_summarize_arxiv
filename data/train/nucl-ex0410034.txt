    "an enhanced production of multi - strange baryons and antibaryons in ultrarelativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions with respect to proton - induced reactions has been predicted long time ago as a signal of quark - gluon plasma formation  @xcite .",
    "enhancements increasing with the strangeness content of the particle have been first observed by wa97 at 158 @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 beam momentum  @xcite . with the na57 experiment",
    "those measurements have been extended over a wider centrality range and to lower beam momentum  @xcite . +",
    "the na57 apparatus was designed to detect strange and multi - strange hyperons by reconstructing their weak decays into final states containing only charged particles ( @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 , @xmath5 @xmath3 @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath3 @xmath8 with @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 and the corresponding decays for antiparticles ) .",
    "tracks are measured in the silicon telescope , a 30 cm long array of pixel detector planes with 5 @xmath9 5 @xmath10 cross section : the acceptance coverage corresponds to about half a unit of rapidity at central rapidity and medium transverse momentum .",
    "additional pixel planes and double - sided silicon microstrip detectors , placed behind the telescope , were used as a lever arm detector to improve the momentum resolution for high momentum tracks .",
    "the centrality trigger , based on a scintillator petal system placed 10 cm downstream of the target , selected the most central 60% of the inelastic cross section for pb - pb collisions .",
    "the centrality of the collision is estimated from the charged particle multiplicity sampled at central rapidity by two stations of silicon strip detectors .",
    "the apparatus was placed inside the 1.4 tesla magnetic field of the goliath magnet .",
    "further details can be found in  @xcite . in the following section we give some details of the analysis procedure ,",
    "then in section 3 we show the dependence of the k@xmath11 , @xmath2 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 yields on centrality and energy for the pb - pb collisions .",
    "the na57 yields are also compared with results from the higher energy data on au - au collisions at rhic . finally , the centrality dependence of hyperon enhancements at both energies are presented and discussed in section 4 .",
    "the results on pb - pb collisions presented in this paper are based on the full statistics collected at 158 and 40 @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 beam momentum . samples of p - be collisions at low energy have been also collected , while for the reference data at 158 @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 the p - be data from wa97 have been used .",
    "+ clean particle signals with negligible residual background have been obtained with geometrical and kinematical cuts : for details see @xcite .",
    "+ the pb - pb sample has been divided into five centrality classes . as an estimate of the number of participant nucleons we use the number of wounded nucleons ( @xmath14 ) computed from the event multiplicity and the measured trigger cross section via the glauber model : for details on the multiplicity analysis see @xcite",
    ". going from the most peripheral ( class 0 ) to the most central ( class 4 ) bin , the average @xmath14 for the pb - pb collisions at 158 @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 are 58 @xmath15 4 , 117 @xmath15 4 , 204 @xmath15 3 , 287 @xmath15 2 and 349 @xmath15 1 respectively .",
    "the most central class and the full range covered by all the five classes correspond to 5% and 53% most central collisions respectively . for each selected particle",
    "a weight is calculated by means of a monte carlo procedure based on geant  @xcite used to estimate geometrical acceptance and reconstruction efficiency losses .",
    "+ the double - differential distributions in rapidity @xmath16 and transverse mass @xmath17=@xmath18 for each particle type have been fitted according to the following expression :    @xmath19    the inverse slope parameters ( @xmath20 ) have been extracted using the maximum likelihood method , assuming a flat rapidity distribution within our acceptance region .",
    "results on the inverse slope parameters both in pb - pb and in p - be collisions , together with a study of the transverse mass spectra for pb - pb in the framework of a blast wave model , are discussed in @xcite .",
    "+ particle yields have been calculated as the number of particles per event extrapolated to a common phase space window , covering full @xmath17 and one unit of rapidity around midrapidity :    @xmath21    the hyperon yields measured in p - be collisions allow to determine the strangeness enhancement factors .",

    "ranges used in star ( i.e. most central 6% , 5% , 10% , 11% collisions for k@xmath11 , @xmath2 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively ) , we can compare results over a wide energy range : in figure [ figyiecomp ] our yields per unit rapidity at 40 @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 ( @xmath23 = 8.8 gev ) and 158 @xmath0 gev/@xmath1 ( @xmath23 = 17.3 gev ) are shown togheter with those from star at @xmath23 = 130 gev .",
