    "complex oxides have propelled a vast research field , in establishing itself as next frontiers in electronic materials by offering unique prospects to control and manipulate new functionalities across their heterointerfaces @xcite .",
    "these materials , typically of the form abo@xmath0 , exhibit strong correlations between the charge , spin , orbital and lattice degrees of freedom , leading to modulation of their device properties and are emerging as strong contenders for beyond moore technology .",
    "interfaces coupling complex oxides exhibit novel functionalities , not present in their parent compounds @xcite .",
    "these primarily stem from broken symmetries at the interface , which when carefully tailored , can lead to unique device functionalities . in this",
    "regard , srruo@xmath0 is a canonical metallic system that has been studied extensively for its growth and physical properties and is widely used as an electrode in complex oxide devices @xcite .",
    "interestingly , srruo@xmath0 undergoes a ferromagnetic transition at 140 k ( t@xmath1 ) and presents a distorted orthorhombic structure _ pbnm _ below 820 k. the microscopic origin of ferromagnetism is supported by the distortions of the oxygen octahedra that are coupled to the degree of hybridization between o @xmath2 and the ru @xmath3 orbitals @xcite.this strongly influences its magnetic and electronic properties on either side of the t@xmath1 and provides an interesting opportunity to study the correlation between magnetism and transport in srruo@xmath0 across its t@xmath1 when integrated in an electronic device .",
    "+ in this work , we employ a nanoscale transport probe to study such complex correlation across an interface between srruo@xmath0 on semiconducting nb : srtio@xmath0 ( nb : sto ) .",
    "principally , this technique allows us to study any material system , whose electronic properties are susceptible to a temperature driven phase transition , while simultaneously allowing us to investigate its homogeneity across such buried interfaces with a semiconductor , at the nanoscale .",
    "this is an important approach for material systems such as complex oxides where small changes in the geometrical properties with thickness or temperature can produce large changes in the electric and magnetic properties .",
    "we perform a systematic experimental study to understand the effect of thickness and temperature on electronic transport across thin films of srruo@xmath0 ( t = 6 , 8 , 9 and 10 unit cells ) with nb : sto and observe an order of magnitude increase in the transmission in the same device , across its ferromagnetic phase transition .",
    "surprisingly though , we find that this increase originates from an enhanced transmission at the interface between srruo@xmath0 and nb : sto , rather than in the bulk of srruo@xmath0 , and manifests as two different transport lengths at room temperature and below t@xmath1 .",
    "we combine these findings with density functional theory ( dft ) calculations to quantitatively understand the role of interface reconstruction , octahedral distortions and exchange splitting in the observed features in electronic transport .",
    "we have grown high quality films of srruo@xmath0 of varying thicknesses , 6 , 8 , 9 and 10 unit cells ( u.c . ) on 0.01 wt.% nb : sto substrates using pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) .",
    "the substrates are chemically treated to ensure a uniform tio@xmath4 termination and characterized for their surface quality with atomic force microscopy ( afm ) @xcite .",
    "this process assumes critical importance because a clean , defect free starting surface is highly desirable for the growth of crystalline epitaxial films of srruo@xmath0 and determines a uniform electronic transport across such a metal - semiconductor ( m - s ) interface .",
    "however , thermal annealing often causes local sro terminations commonly occurring at the terrace edges of the annealed substrates . with unequal growth rate of srruo@xmath0 on sro and tio@xmath4 terminations , clear trenches along local sro terminating sites",
    "are observed where srruo@xmath0 grown is thinner than on tio@xmath4 terminations @xcite .",

    "the root - mean - square surface roughness of the 6 u.c . and",
    "10 u.c . films , outside the trenches , are found to be 0.21 nm and 0.15 nm respectively .",
    "the grown srruo@xmath0 films were characterized for their electronic transport and magnetic properties using standard van der pauw method and superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometry , respectively .",
    "the electrical resistivity studies on the films show a typical metallic behavior for all thicknesses .",
    "resistivities of 6 and 10 u.c .",
    "srruo@xmath0 films , measured from 300 k down to 15 k , are shown in figure 1c .",
    "their electrical properties are strongly affected by the film thickness , evidenced by a higher resistivity observed for the 6 u.c .",
    "film that decreases for the 10 u.c .",
    "a study of the temperature variation of resistivity shows a kink indicating the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition , with the corresponding t@xmath1 ( marked by black arrows ) derived from the temperature dependence of the derivative of resistivity plots ( not shown ) .",
    "the curie temperature ( t@xmath1 ) determined for the 6 u.c .",
    "film is 135 k , and for 10 u.c .",
    "is 142 k. from squid magnetometry studies , the magnetic properties of the films were studied in an applied field of 0.1 t on field cooling for a temperature range between 5 k to 300 k ( figure 1d ) .",
    "the t@xmath1 for the 6 u.c . and 10 u.c .",
    "films determined from these plots ( derivative of magnetic moment with temperature , not shown ) are found to be 135 k and 142 k respectively , and demonstrates the coupled magnetic and electric properties in srruo@xmath0 .",
    "the high value of the saturation magnetic moment obtained from experiments arises due to the strained films on ( 001 ) srtio@xmath0 , which decreases the orbital overlap via increased bond angle in ru - o bonds , in such ultrathin films of srruo@xmath0 .",
    "this has been reported earlier in srruo@xmath0 films @xcite .",
    "thus , through a combination of surface characterization technique and physical property measurements , we establish the high quality of the films used in our work . + in order to probe electronic transport of the deposited srruo@xmath0 films ,",
    "they are patterned with standard uv lithography and further ion beam etched to be defined as devices as shown in figure 1e .",
    "our experimental nanoscale transport probe is known as ballistic electron emission microscopy ( beem ) ( figure 1c ) which uses the scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) tip to inject a distribution of hot electrons with energies higher than the fermi energy ( e@xmath5 ) @xcite . in this study , we use a modified ultra high vacuum ( uhv ) stm system from rhk technology and the measurements are performed at 300 k and 120 k using ptir metal tips .",
    "an electrical contact between the stm tip and srruo@xmath0 measures the tunnel current .",
    "the device design necessitates an additional contact at the rear - end of nb : sto , for the collection of the transmitted electrons .",
    "these injected hot electrons , driven by the applied bias _",
    "v@xmath6 _ with respect to the fermi level of the metal , travel across the metallic base to reach the m - s interface ; if their energy is sufficient to overcome the schottky barrier , they can be collected into the semiconductor conduction bands ( figure 1f ) . to obtain the beem spectra ,",
    "the stm tip is held at a fixed location while _",
    "v@xmath6 _ is varied within a voltage range and the collector current is recorded in the constant current mode . as these hot electrons propagate through the srruo@xmath0 films , they undergo scattering , which influences the collected current .",
    "the collected electrons in nb : sto are primarily those whose momentum parallel to the interface is conserved , the rest are back - scattered into the srruo@xmath0 base layer .",
    "these electrons serve as an important parameter to study strong correlations in such metallic oxide thin films and provide information on the homogeneity of the interface electronic structure with high spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "the determination of the relative strengths of such scattering processes ( elastic / inelastic ) enables a comprehensive understanding of electron transport in complex oxides and allows for designing of new oxide based electronic devices . +      the hot electron distribution encounters elastic and inelastic scattering while transmitting through the srruo@xmath0 metallic base . in this process ,",
    "the momentum distribution at the m - s interface is broadened , as compared to the injection interface , adding to the reduction of the collected beem current ( i@xmath7 ) @xcite.these effects get more pronounced as the thickness ( d@xmath8 ) of the base layer is increased .",
    "the normalized beem transmission follows an exponential behavior as described by @xcite :    @xmath9\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 is the energy - dependent hot electron attenuation length , i@xmath7 is the collected beem current , i@xmath6 is the injected tunnel current and c is a constant that is the kinematic transmission factor representative of electron transport across the m - s interface .",
    "figure 2 shows the beem transmission data for various thickness of srruo@xmath0 thin films , in their paramagnetic ( 300 k ) and ferromagnetic ( 120 k ) phases .",
    "first we discuss the observation for the paramagnetic phase ( figure 2a ) .",
    "the transmission for all film thicknesses is low up to a certain bias voltage beyond which , the transmission increases rapidly .",
    "this onset in bias voltage corresponds to the local schottky barrier height ( sbh ) at the m - s interface . in accordance to the bell - kaiser ( b - k ) model , a plot of the square root of beem current versus the bias voltage yields the value of sbh , which in this case is 1.13@xmath110.03 ev ( inset , figure 2a ) @xcite .",
    "it matches well with our previously extracted values for such an interface @xcite . as the thickness of srruo@xmath0 films",
    "is increased , a decrease in transmission is observed .",
    "however , the local sbh extracted from measurements on films of different thicknesses are found to be the same , thus providing yet another proof of a high quality growth of atomically sharp m - s interfaces .",
    "the representative beem spectra shown for each thickness are averages of several spectra taken at different devices and locations .",
    "+ electronic transport across the ferromagnetic phase transition in srruo@xmath0 thin films was studied across its interface with nb : sto , in the same set of devices , by performing similar beem measurements at 120 k. the characteristic beem spectra are shown in figure 2b .",
    "similar to our earlier observations , the beem transmission progressively decreases with increasing thickness of the films .",
    "we find that the hot electron transmission increases by an order of magnitude as compared to its corresponding values at 300 k. the extracted sbh at 120 k , at these interfaces , is found to be 1.14@xmath110.03  ev ( inset , figure 2b ) , which is the same as that obtained in its paramagnetic phase .",
    "one can thus safely discard the origin of the enhanced beem transmission in srruo@xmath0 at 120 k , due to differences in the sbh across its magnetic phase transition .",
    "+      an exponential fit of the beem transmission for varying thicknesses of srruo@xmath0 films allows us to extract the ( energy dependent ) transport length scale known as attenuation length ( equation 1 ) . above e@xmath5 , the transmission of hot electrons in srruo@xmath0 films is mostly governed by inelastic scattering , originating from the availability of increased phase space for hot electrons to decay into @xcite .",
    "the extracted attenuation length of the carriers reflects the combined effects of inelastic , elastic as well as quasi - elastic scatterings .",
    "we plot the transmissions for the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phase of srruo@xmath0 at a certain bias voltage of -2 v , shown in figure 3a .",
    "an important observation is that the beem transmission starts to deviate appreciably at 120 k from that at 300 k , with decreasing thickness .",
    "this has not been observed earlier in other metallic systems using beem .",
    "extrapolation of the data for zero srruo@xmath0 thickness shows two orders higher transmission , at the interface for ferromagnetic srruo@xmath0 .",
    "an exponential fit using equation 1 , yields an attenuation length of 1.6@xmath110.2 u.c . in the paramagnetic phase and 0.88@xmath110.4 u.c . in the ferromagnetic phase at -2 v. in figure 3b ,",
    "we plot the energy dependence of the attenuation length by fitting the data obtained in figure 2 with equation 1 for energies above the sbh .",
    "we find that the attenuation length decreases with increasing energy , consistent with the enhancement of the density of states ( dos ) at higher energies @xcite .",
    "what is surprising is that in - spite of the enhanced transmission in the ferromagnetic phase , the attenuation length in srruo@xmath0 is shorter , for all energies at 120 k , than at 300 k. this apparent conundrum is explained by our _ ab initio _ calculations , taking into account the characteristics of geometries and electronic structures at the interface between srruo@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0 along with the quasiparticle renormalization of attenuation length .",
    "+      we have performed _ ab initio _ density functional calculations with a specific focus on correlating the structural and electronic properties at the interface to the beem transmission and to understand the origin of the flipping of the attenuation lengths at 120 k and 300 k. in order to simulate srruo@xmath0 thin films grown on srtio@xmath0 ( 001 ) substrates , we fix the lattice parameter @xmath12 to the experimental value of the srtio@xmath0 substrate . 3 , 6 and 9 unit cells of srruo@xmath0 have been considered in the low temperature ferromagnetic and room temperature ( rt ) paramagnetic phases . as",
    "a paramagnetic phase with disordered local moments is difficult to simulate within our computational technique , we study the nonmagnetic phase as the rt phase and ferromagnetic phase calculated at 0 k will represent the low temperature ( lt ) phase .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : figure1th]a the supercell with 6 layers of srruo@xmath0 on 3 layers of srtio@xmath0 . in the following discussions",
    ", we will follow the notation shown in figure [ fig : figure1th]a , where we denote stol ( or srol ) with l=1,2 , ... , the l - th layer from the srtio@xmath0/srruo@xmath0 interface .",
    "+ to determine the energy dependent attenuation length @xmath13 , we calculate the mean value over the bands and k - points , at a given energy @xmath14 , of the product of the modulus of the group velocity along the @xmath15 axis @xmath16 and the lifetime @xmath17 , which is expressed as : @xmath18 where the lifetime is proportional to the inverse of the cumulative density of states from the fermi level to the energy @xmath14@xcite . we have only considered the z - component , as the beem transmissions across the m - s interface are measured along this direction . as seen in figure [ fig : figure1th]b , the attenuation length @xmath13 is almost constant in the range between 1.6 and 2.2 ev ( above e@xmath5 ) and is greater at 120 k than at rt . in recent works @xcite ,",
    "the importance of dynamical correlations in srruo@xmath0 have been discussed with the aid of dynamical mean field theory . whereas the dynamical correlations and hence , the temperature dependent quasiparticle weight z are beyond the scope of lda , we note that this weight is 1 in lda and is a multiplicative factor of the spectrum and the velocity . assuming the same quasiparticle weight for the @xmath19 manifold and neglecting its influence on @xmath20 , we get a reduction of the attenuation length , which is more pronounced at lower temperatures . in figure",
    "[ fig : figure1th]b we plot the attenuation length multiplying @xmath21 by @xmath22 and observe that under these assumptions , the attenuation length at rt is greater than at 120 k , in agreement with the experimental findings . +      to understand the experimentally observed enhancement in the interface transmissions at 120 k and 300 k , we calculate the electronic and geometric structures of srruo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interfaces . considering the variation in the geometric and magnetic properties , we can divide the srruo@xmath0 thin films in three regions along the c - axis : surface , inner layer and interface region .",
    "our calculated densities of states of srruo@xmath0 along with that of srtio@xmath0 are shown in figure [ fig : figure4th]a for 9 u.c .",
    "of srruo@xmath0 in the lt ferromagnetic phase and the rt nonmagnetic phases .",
    "it is observed that between 1  ev and 2.2  ev ( above e@xmath5 ) , the dos in srruo@xmath0 is dominated by @xmath19 electrons whereas in srtio@xmath0 , the @xmath23 electrons dominate with a larger dos between 1.2 and 1.4  ev ( above e@xmath5 ) in the nonmagnetic phase of srruo@xmath0 .",
    "the exchange split @xmath19 state produces a smaller dos at lt between 1.2 and 1.4  ev ( above e@xmath5 ) .",
    "while we observe the differences between lt and rt phases in all sro layers , sro1 layer at the interface needs an extra attention .",
    "a distinct feature of @xmath24 character ( marked by the shaded area ) is observed for rt phase in the sro1 layer along with the renormalization of @xmath19 dos between 1.2 and 1.3 ev ( above e@xmath5 ) .",
    "this is not an energy shift but is due to an enlargement of the bandwidth .",
    "our calculated hopping parameters , for example , for the 6 u.c . at rt are 580  mev between the @xmath25-@xmath26 orbitals ( corresponding wannier function shown in figure [ fig : figure1th]a ) in the sro1 layer and 540 - 543  mev for other layers .",
    "also , the hopping mismatch between interface ( 575 mev ) and inner layers ( 554 - 561 mev ) is reduced at lt .",
    "thus , we can clearly see that the mismatch between the interface and inner layers is larger at rt .",
    "we further note from our dos calculations that the mismatch of the electronic states at the interface between srruo@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0 is larger at rt than at lt .",
    "such elastic scattering effects will lead to a reduction in the beem transmission at rt .",
    "all these differences in the electronic structures of the two phases strongly suggest the importance of the prefactor c in equation 1 , which influences the beem transmission at lt and rt phases .",
    "+ the difference in the characteristics at the interface for lt and rt phases is quite evident also in the structural properties shown in figure [ fig : figure4th]b .",
    "the interface reconstruction makes this aspect more evident in the in - plane bond angles compared to the out - of - plane bond angles . for a slab of reasonable thickness ( 9 u.c . in our case ) , one can quantitatively identify the surface , inner layers and interface regions by the evolution of the ru - o - ru bond angle in the _ ab _ plane along the c - axis as shown in figure [ fig : figure4th]b . for the 9 u.c .",
    "case , a large region of inner layers ( properties similar to bulk ) exists while this region is not distinctly observed in the 3 u.c .",
    "case . due to the interface reconstruction , the interface layer sro1",
    "is characterized by a ru - o - ru in - plane bond angle having a value between the srruo@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0 bulk values .",
    "the properties of the inner layers are closer to the bulk . at the surface",
    ", we always obtain a bond angle larger than the bulk .",
    "apart from the general differences between bond angles for different regions of the slab , an important observation can be made regarding the bond angles for the lt and rt phases .",
    "+ it is clearly seen that the difference in bond angle between sro1 and other sro layers is larger for the rt phase compared to the lt one .",
    "for example , in the 6 u.c .",
    "case , the difference in the bond angle between sro1 and sro5 is 1.5@xmath27 for the lt phase , while it is 3.0@xmath27 for the rt phase ( figure [ fig : figure4th]b ) .",
    "this influences the hopping of electrons ( as evident from the calculated hopping parameters mentioned above ) and hence the transport properties at the interfaces @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the differences in the geometries and electronic structures between sro1 and other sro layers are less dramatic in the lt phase compared to the rt one , which may effectively lead to an enhanced transmission of hot electrons across the interface at lt .",
    "the larger mismatch at rt between interface and inner layers will yield a smaller transmission factor ( c factor in equation 1 ) in the rt phase .",
    "such a substantial influence of geometric and structural changes at the interface leading to strong temperature dependent transport characteristics across the magnetic phase transition in srruo@xmath0 is a remarkable finding , not observed before in any oxide heterostructure .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the beem transmission through thin films of srruo@xmath0 of various thicknesses , interfaced with srtio@xmath0 across its magnetic transition . the increase in beem transmission at 120",
    "k compared to rt is accompanied by a surprising flipping of the attenuation length .",
    "our first principles calculations indicate strong geometrical reconstructions at the interfaces characterized by ru - o - ru bond angles along with distinct features in electronic structures of the ru - d orbitals , both of which are strongly dependent on the magnetic phases . as a consequence , the importance of the transmission factor in the expression for beem current",
    "is realized to explain the experimentally observed beem transmission data .",
    "moreover , the inclusion of the temperature dependent quasiparticle weight for the calculation of the attenuation length correctly describes the experimental observation at 120 k and rt .",
    "the evolution of such unique features in electronic transport in complex oxide heterostructures , across a magnetic phase transition , opens new possibilities to manipulate the electronic and spin degrees of freedom by a selective choice and tailoring of their interfaces .",
    "this approach of tuning heterointerfaces by coupling structural , electronic and magnetic properties can be extended to other material systems with promising prospects for future oxide electronic and spintronic devices .",
    "_ experimental details _ we grow srruo@xmath0 films of different thickness by pulsed laser deposition .",
    "all the devices were grown on [ 001 ] nb doped srtio@xmath0 substrates with 0.01 wt.@xmath28 of nb .",
    "the nb : sto substrates used for deposition were treated chemically to obtain uniform tio@xmath4 terminations , and were annealed at 960@xmath27 c which rendered a clean surface with uniform straight terraces . the cleanliness and uniformity of the interface becomes critical in electronic transport across the heterointerface .",
    "the films were grown using pld with a krf excimer laser with a repetition rate of 1 hz at an oxygen pressure of 0.13 mbar at 600@xmath27 c. their corresponding thicknesses were determined _ in - situ _ by reflection high energy electron diffraction .",
    "electrical resistivities of the films were obtained by standard van der pauw method within a temperature range of 15 k to 300 k. magnetic measurements were performed using a quantum design mpms xl-7 squid . in order to fabricate devices , patterns of 100x150 @xmath29 m@xmath30 areas",
    "were defined using standard ultraviolet ( uv ) lithography technique where 100 nm of au was deposited for making the top contact , providing the pathway for the stm current . thereafter , device areas of 200x300 @xmath29 m@xmath30 were defined with the au pads on top of it , and the samples were ion beam etched ( ibe ) with a pre - calibrated etch - stop .",
