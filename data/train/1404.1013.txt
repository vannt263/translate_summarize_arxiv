    "in the short and mid - term future , top quark studies will be mainly driven by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments  @xcite .",
    "exploration of top quarks will , however , be an integral part of particle physics studies at any future facility  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore an interesting question how much improvement in the measurement of the top - quark mass , @xmath0 , can be accomplished at the lhc .",
    "we present possible improvements both for running conditions foreseen in the near and medium future and for various @xmath1 measurement techniques developed at the lhc .",
    "projections are provided for the expected integrated luminosity of 30 fb@xmath2 , 300 fb@xmath2 , and 3000 fb@xmath2 at a center - of - mass energy , @xmath3 = 13 - 14 tev .",
    "for the first two scenarios the pileup conditions are assumed to be somewhat elevated , while for the latter ( _  high - luminosity lhc or phase ii \" _ ) scenario the pileup is assumed to be much more severe , requiring an upgraded detector to maintain good physics performance  @xcite .    with the dataset up to 5 fb@xmath2 at 7 tev",
    "the lhc experiments have already achieved results comparable in precision to those from the tevatron collider .",
    "the tevatron experiments have reported a combined precision of 0.87 gev ( 0.50% )  @xcite and the lhc experiments have reached a precision of 0.95 gev ( 0.55% )  @xcite .",
    "the dominant contributions to systematic uncertainty are the jet - energy scale ( jes ) calibration and qcd modeling .",
    "recently , the first world combination of @xmath1 measurements has been performed by the cdf and d@xmath4 experiments at the tevatron and the atlas and cms experiments at the lhc .",
    "the resulting combined measurement is 173.34 @xmath5 0.27 ( stat . )",
    "@xmath5 0.71 ( syst . ) gev , with a total uncertainty of 0.76  gev ( 0.44% )  @xcite .",
    "since the experimental sensitivity is entering the sub - gev range , issues of theoretical interpretation have become important .",
    "existing measurements rely on complex techniques required by the difficult hadron collider environment , while measurements at a lepton collider use either the invariant mass or a threshold scan that can give a clean theoretical interpretation of the result .",
    "new experimental techniques developed at the lhc help to mitigate this issue , but they typically have larger statistical uncertainties .",
    "thus we estimate how the alternative methods may profit from large integrated luminosities .",
    "the extrapolations presented here are based on optimistic assumptions , anticipating improvements in the understanding of systematic uncertainties that are believed to be realistically possible with the large data samples .",
    "they also assume no new irreducible systematic uncertainties , as well as no known limit of experimental uncertainties .",
    "a lot of detailed study and dedicated work will be needed to achieve an understanding sufficient to claim the level of precision presented here  @xcite .",
