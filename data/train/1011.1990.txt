    "this paper concerns the fluid dynamic limit to the compressible euler equations for two physical models , that is , the compressible navier - stokes equations and the boltzmann equation . in the first part",
    ", we consider zero dissipation limit of the compressible navier - stokes system for viscous and heat conductive fluid in the lagrangian coordinates : @xmath0 where the functions @xmath1 represent the specific volume , velocity and the absolute temperature of the gas respectively .",
    "and @xmath2 is the pressure , @xmath3 is the internal energy , @xmath4 is the viscosity coefficient , @xmath5 is the coefficient of the heat conductivity . here , both @xmath6 and @xmath7 are taken as positive constants .",
    "and we consider the perfect gas where @xmath8 with @xmath9 denoting the entropy of the gas and @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the gas parameters .",
    "formally , as the coefficients @xmath7 and @xmath6 tend to zero , the limiting system of is the compressible euler equations @xmath12    the study of this limiting process of viscous flows when the viscosity and heat conductivity coefficients tend to zero , is one of the important problems in the theory of the compressible fluid .",
    "when the solution of the inviscid flow is smooth , the zero dissipation limit can be solved by classical scaling method .",
    "however , the inviscid compressible flow usually contains discontinuities , such as shock waves and contact discontinuities .",
    "therefore , how to justify the zero dissipation limit to the euler equations with basic wave patterns is a natural and difficult problem .    keeping in mind that the navier - stokes equations can be derived from the boltzmann equation through the chapman - enskog expansion when",
    "the knudsen number is close to zero , we assume the following condition on the viscosity constant @xmath6 and the heat conductivity coefficient @xmath7 in the system , cf .",
    "also @xcite : @xmath13 now we briefly review some recent results on the zero dissipation limit of the compressible fluid with basic wave patterns . for the hyperbolic conservation laws with artificial viscosity",
    "@xmath14 goodman - xin @xcite verified the viscous limit for piecewise smooth solutions separated by non - interacting shock waves using a matched asymptotic expansion method .",
    "for the compressible isentropic navier - stokes equations , hoff - liu @xcite first proved the vanishing viscosity limit for piecewise constant solutions separated by non - interacting shocks even with initial layer .",
    "later xin @xcite obtained the zero dissipation limit for rarefaction waves and wang @xcite generalized the result of goodmann - xin @xcite to the isentropic navier - stokes equations .",
    "for the inviscid limit of the full compressible navier - stokes equations , jiang - ni - sun @xcite justified the zero dissipation limit of the system for centered rarefaction waves .",
    "wang @xcite proved the zero dissipation limit of the system for piecewise smooth solutions separated by shocks using the matched asymptotic expansion method introduced in @xcite .",
    "recently , xin - zeng @xcite considered the zero dissipation limit of the system for single rarefaction wave with well prepared initial data and obtained a uniform decay rate in terms of the dissipation coefficients . and",
    "ma @xcite obtained the zero dissipation limit of a single strong contact discontinuity in any fixed time interval with a decay rate .",
    "however , to our knowledge , so far there is no result on the zero dissipation limit of the system for superposition of different types of basic wave patterns . in the first part of this paper",
    ", we investigate the fluid dynamic limit of the compressible navier - stokes equations when the corresponding euler equations have the riemann solution as a superposition of two rarefaction waves and a contact discontinuity . for this , we need to study the interaction between the rarefaction waves and contact discontinuity .    in the second part of the paper",
    ", we study the hydrodynamic limit of the boltzmann equation @xcite with slab symmetry @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the density distribution function of particles at time @xmath18 with location @xmath19 and velocity @xmath20 , and @xmath4 is called the knudsen number which is proportional to the mean free path .",
    "remark that the notation @xmath6 here is same as the viscosity of the compressible navier - stokes equations ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) , but it has different physical meanings from ( [ ( 1.1 ) ] ) in different equations and related contexts . for monatomic gas , the rotational invariance of the particles leads to the following bilinear form for the collision operator @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the velocities after an elastic collision of two particles with velocities @xmath23 before the collision . here , @xmath24 is the angle between the relative velocity @xmath25 and the unit vector @xmath26 in @xmath27 .",
    "the conservation of momentum and energy gives the following relation between the velocities before and after collision : @xmath28 \\ ; \\gamma , \\\\[3 mm ]   \\xi_*'= \\xi _ * + [ ( \\xi-\\xi_*)\\cdot \\gamma ] \\ ; \\gamma .",
    "\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    in this paper , we consider the boltzmann equation for two basic models , that is , the hard sphere model and the hard potential including maxwellian molecules under the assumption of angular cut - off .",
    "for this , we assume that the collision kernel @xmath29 takes one of the following two forms , @xmath30 and @xmath31),~n\\ge 5.\\ ] ] here , @xmath32 is the index in the potential of inverse power law which is proportional to @xmath33 with @xmath34 being the distance between two concerned particles .",
    "formally , when the knudsen number @xmath6 tends to zero , the limit of the boltzmann equation is the classical system of euler equations @xmath35_t+[\\rho u_1(e+\\f{|u|^2}{2})+pu_1]_x=0 , \\end{array } \\right . \\label{(1.5)}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 here , @xmath37 is the density , @xmath38 is the macroscopic velocity , @xmath39 is the internal energy of the gas , and @xmath40 with @xmath41 being the gas constant is the pressure .",
    "note that the temperature @xmath42 is related to the internal energy by @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are the collision invariants given by @xmath45 that satisfy @xmath46    how to justify the above limit , that is , the euler equation ( [ ( 1.5 ) ] ) from boltzmann equation ( [ ( 1.4 ) ] ) when knudsen number @xmath6 tends to zero is an open problem going way back to the time of maxwell .",
    "for this , hilbert introduced the famous hilbert expansion to show formally that the first order approximation of the boltzmann equation gives the euler equations . on the other hand , it is important to verify this limit process rigorously in mathematics . for the case",
    "when the euler equation has smooth solutions , the zero knudsen number limit of the boltzmann equation has been studied even in the case with an initial layer , cf .",
    "ukai - asano @xcite , caflish @xcite , lachowicz @xcite and nishida @xcite etc .",
    "however , as is well - known , solutions of the euler equations ( [ ( 1.5 ) ] ) in general develop singularities , such as shock waves and contact discontinuities .",
    "therefore , how to verify the fluid limit from boltzmann equation to the euler equations with basic wave patterns becomes an natural problem . in this direction ,",
    "yu @xcite showed that when the solution of the euler equations ( [ ( 1.5 ) ] ) contains only non - interacting shocks , there exists a sequence of solutions to the boltzmann equation that converge to a local maxwellian defined by the solution of the euler equations ( [ ( 1.5 ) ] ) uniformly away from the shock in any fixed time interval .",
    "in this work , the inner and outer expansions developed by goodman - xin @xcite for conservation laws and the hilbert expansion were skillfully and cleverly used .",
    "recently , huang - wang - yang @xcite proved the fluid dynamic limit of the boltzmann equation to the euler equations for a single contact discontinuity where the uniform decay rate was also obtained .",
    "and xin - zeng @xcite proved the fluid dynamic limit of the compressible navier - stokes equations and boltzmann equation to the euler equations with non - interacting rarefaction waves . about the detailed introductions of the boltzmann equation and its hydrodynamic limit ,",
    "see the books @xcite , @xcite etc .    in this paper , we will study the hydrodynamic limit of the boltzmann equation when the corresponding euler equations have a riemann solution as a superposition of two rarefaction waves and a contact discontinuity .",
    "more precisely , given a riemann solution of the euler equations ( [ ( 1.5 ) ] ) with superposition of two rarefaction waves and a contact discontinuity , we will show that there exists a family of solutions to the boltzmann equation that converge to a local maxwellian defined by the euler solution uniformly away from the contact discontinuity for strictly positive time as @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , a uniform convergence rate in @xmath6 is also given .",
    "as mentioned above for the compressible navier - stokes equations , we also need to study the detailed wave interactions through this limiting process .    for later use , we now briefly present the micro - macro decomposition around the local maxwellian defined by the solution to the boltzmann equation , cf .",
