    "in studying brane configurations related to large @xmath0 @xmath1 pure gauge theories with eight supercharges , the authors of ref.@xcite considered the bps supergravity solutions which ought to result in taking @xmath14 large , where @xmath15 is the string coupling , and @xmath0 is the number of constituent branes .",
    "such supergravity solutions are afflicted by a naked singularity known as a `` repulson''@xcite which is unphysical , and incompatible with the physics of the gauge theory .    upon closer examination ( by investigating",
    "how such a geometry could have arisen by constructing it out of a large number of its constituent bps parts ) it was argued@xcite that the repulson is not present .",
    "the supergravity solution may only be taken as physical down to a radius of closest approach . at that locus of points ( in the case of a @xmath16dimensional gauge theory ,",
    "it is a @xmath17sphere , @xmath18 ) , there is an enhanced gauge symmetry in the parent string theory and new physics , consistent with the related @xmath1 gauge theory , takes over .",
    "that locus of points called the `` enhanon'' is new type of hypersurface essentially made of d  branes .",
    "the entire curved geometry is produced by a large number of identical bps objects .",
    "an individual unit , when separated from all the others , is an object which has a simple description in terms of ( roughly ) a pair of d  branes , one of which is partially wrapped on a @xmath19 surface , and the other which is induced by the wrapping ( see later ) .",
    "it it therefore a sharply localised and heavy object . upon approaching the geometry produced by a large number of its counterparts , the unit becomes lighter and less sharply defined , ultimately going to zero mass while spreading out completely at the enhanon locus .",
    "@xcite also went on to display a variety of familiar dual situations in string theory ( with related gauge theory physics ) in which the enhanon phenomena described above play a crucial role .",
    "for this reason , and also because it is a genuinely new mechanism by which string theory avoids an important class of spacetime singularity@xcite , the enhanon deserves to be better understood and characterised .",
    "we show in this paper that enhanons also arise naturally in similar situations pertaining to large @xmath0 @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath16dimensional gauge theories , and construct these new classes using orientifolds .",
    "it is therefore clear that enhanons may be broadly classified into types @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and  @xmath8 .",
    "( there is no natural @xmath20type which has a smooth geometrical interpretation , since the rank of those groups can not be made arbitrarily large in order to make contact with a supergravity discussion . )",
    "the latter three types differ globally from type @xmath5 by having an extra @xmath9 identification , making them into @xmath21 instead of @xmath18 .",
    "all types can be distinguished locally by examining their subleading behaviour in @xmath0 .    as a concrete example",
    ", we shall focus in particular on @xmath10 dimensional gauge theory for @xmath0 large .",
    "the reason that we focus on this case is that we can explicitly write the relevant part of the supergravity solution , using the fact that one of the relevant orientifold 6planes has a smooth m  theory realization as the atiyah ",
    "hitchin manifold@xcite , while d6branes are related to taub ",
    "while much of the structure of the final result can be deduced on general grounds ( the overall global @xmath9 is the main feature ) , we show that a whole family of @xmath11 corrections can be completely characterised using the construction that we present .",
    "an overview is as follows : in the next section , we orient the reader and set up our notation by reviewing the salient features of ref.@xcite . in section  3",
    ", we discuss generally how orientifolds yield the other types of enhanon .",
    "crucially , we use a familiar gauge theory fact to help us make a general statement about the result of wrapping branes and orientifolds on @xmath19 .    in section 4 , in preparation for the device of using the atiyah ",
    "hitchin manifold to construct the eleven dimensional solution for the @xmath22 dimensional @xmath23 gauge theory cases , we lift the @xmath5type case to m  theory and reconsider it in m ",
    "theory terms .",
    "in particular , we observe that while in ten dimensions there is a discussion of the geometry in terms of its constituents being dynamical objects ( d  branes ) , there is no analogous discussion involving dynamical objects in m  theory .",
    "the geometry can be discussed only in terms of the non ",
    "dynamical @xmath19 and multi  taub  nut . taking a probe to be an m2brane fails to show the enhanon , since the geometry",
    "can not be constructed out of them .",
    "fortunately , long before one reaches the `` repulson '' singularity in the geometry , there is a sensible dual heterotic string description ( one of the duals in ref.@xcite ( see also refs.@xcite ) ) , where the geometry again has natural brane probes revealing the enhanon .",
    "so we see again that the enhanon mechanism resolves the physics of a supergravity situation , this time by driving eleven dimensional supergravity back to string theory .    in section 5 ,",
    "we show how to modify the discussion to make it pertinent to the orientifolded enhanon , using the atiyah ",
    "hitchin manifold combined with multi ",
    "taub  nut . on returning to string theory",
    ", we study the supergravity solution , and extract the expression for the enhanon radius and the leading @xmath11 correction which follows from the orientifold s presence .",
    "we point out that an entire class of @xmath11 corrections can be concisely summarised in terms of the exponentially small differences between the smooth atiyah ",
    "hitchin manifold and the ( negative mass ) taub  nut solution .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have such control over all of the corrections present in the geometry .",
    "we also present the result of a probe computation analogous to that performed in ref.@xcite which yields the one  loop result for the metric on a subspace of the coulomb branch of moduli space for the @xmath23 gauge theories .",
    "again , they differ from the @xmath1 case by a global @xmath9 action , and the leading behaviour for the @xmath11 corrections we computed . in all cases ,",
    "there is a related monopole moduli space problem , in the spirit of refs.@xcite .",
    "consider wrapping @xmath0 coincident d6branes on a @xmath19 surface of volume @xmath24 .",
    "this results in an effective 2 + 1 dimensional object , with @xmath25 units of d2brane charge , due to the interaction@xcite @xmath26 on the d6brane world  volume .",
    "the precise value @xmath25 comes about since @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and because for @xmath19 @xmath30 integrates to @xmath31 .",
    "we will call this wrong  sign d2brane a `` d2*brane '' .",
    "it preserves the same supersymmetries as a correct sign d2brane with the same orientation , and therefore is _ not _ an anti  d2brane .",
    "it is useful to think of it as a brane which is bound inside the d6brane worldvolume , resulting from the curvature of the @xmath19 .",
    "it is quite analogous to the ( correct sign ) d2brane which would be bound inside the worldvolume of a d6brane if there was a field theory instanton configuration , due to the term@xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "an instanton in the 6 + 1 dimensional gauge theory has @xmath34 , and consequently has the charge of a single d2brane . in the limit where the instanton shrinks to zero size",
    ", there is a good description@xcite in the full string theory corresponding to a fully localised pointlike d2brane .",
    "similarly , one would recover pointlike d2*branes from wrapping the d6branes if @xmath19 s curvature was located at a finite number of points , such as in an orbifold limit .",
    "this situation ( no doubt ) has a good string theory description , and is worth investigating . in the present case ,",
    "the curvature of the @xmath19 is distributed everywhere , and correspondingly the d2*branes are delocalised everywhere on it .",
    "imagine that the @xmath19 surface lies in the @xmath35 directions , and that the remaining ( unwrapped ) part of the d6brane lies in the @xmath36 directions .",
    "there is an @xmath1 gauge theory on the @xmath22 dimensional worldvolume , with eight supercharges .",
    "the gauge supermultiplet consists of a gauge field @xmath37 and three scalars @xmath38 , where @xmath39 .",
    "the scalars parameterise the positions of the d6d2 * system in the transverse directions , @xmath40 .",
    "this vector supermultiplet transforms in the adjoint representation of @xmath1 .",
    "the gauge theory has a scalar potential of the form @xmath41 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "supersymmetric solutions of the theory , giving a moduli space of vacua , may be found by choosing vacuum expectation values ( `` vevs '' ) of the scalars such that they are in the cartan subalgebra of @xmath1 .",
    "this breaks @xmath42 , giving the `` coulomb branch '' of moduli space .",
    "classically , the moduli space is @xmath43 where the @xmath44 factors represent the periodic scalars resulting from dualising the gauge fields ( recall that we are in @xmath22 dimensions ) .",
    "the @xmath45 is the weyl group of @xmath1 , which acts as permutations of the @xmath46 eigenvalues of the @xmath47 s , which are now in the cartan subalgebra .",
    "@xmath48 is the gauge symmetry on @xmath0 separated , but wrapped d ",
    "branes , where the extra @xmath49 we would naively expect corresponds to the overall centre of mass of the system .",
    "we will focus on the situation where all of the branes are coincident , which is to say that the vev s of all of the fields are given the same value , except for a complete set of four making a multiplet giving the location of a probe brane in the background of all the others . in the gauge theory ,",
    "this is equivalent to focusing on a particular subspace of the relative moduli space . in another , equivalent description@xcite , it is the four dimensional @xmath50 subspace representing relative moduli space of the full moduli space of @xmath0 @xmath51 monopoles ; @xmath46 of them are coincident , and one is separated .",
    "the classical moduli space is then @xmath52 one of the results of ref.@xcite ( see below ) is the computation of the one  loop result for the metric on this moduli space . here",
    ", we shall compute a closely related version , representing a similar subspace of the coulomb branch of the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , or @xmath4 gauge theory .",
    "these will also have an interpretation as multimonopole moduli spaces , where the monopoles are of an @xmath51 gauge theory with a @xmath9 identification .",
    "for @xmath14 large , ( @xmath15 is the closed string coupling ) we have a chance of obtaining a good description of the geometry of the system in terms of a ten dimensional type  iia supergravity solution , which is @xmath53 here , @xmath54 ; @xmath39 and the @xmath35 directions contain @xmath55 , the ( unknown ) metric of a unit volume @xmath19 .",
    "the 345harmonic functions representing the d2* and d6branes respectively are : @xmath56 ( recall that the d2 * s are delocalised in @xmath19 ) , with @xmath57 the latter are written so as to give the masses of the bps object which is formed when we wrap a d6brane to make the d6d2 * object : @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "there are a number of things to note about this supergravity solution .",
    "first , note that @xmath15 appears as the asymptotic value of the string coupling far away from the core of the solution ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the actual string coupling in the interior of the solution is given by the value of @xmath61 , as usual , and varies with @xmath62 .",
    "similarly , the volume of @xmath19 is a function of @xmath62 : @xmath63 , which approaches @xmath24 asymptotically , and decreases , becoming zero at the singularity @xmath64 .",
    "one of the key points noticed in ref.@xcite is that while a naive examination of the supergravity solution shows an unsettling naked singularity ( the `` repulson''@xcite ) at @xmath64 , this part of the geometry is actually non  physical",
    ". the geometry should only be taken at face value down to radius @xmath65 this is the radius at which a number of special things happen :    * the volume of @xmath19 is equal to the special value @xmath59 . *",
    "the 5 + 1 dimensional @xmath19compactified string theory has an r ",
    "r sector @xmath49 which becomes enhanced to an @xmath51 gauge symmetry . *",
    "a d6d2 * probe is a monopole of this @xmath49 , and becomes massless at the enhanced symmetry point .",
    "it also ceases to be pointlike , and dissolves into the `` enhanon '' locus at  @xmath66 , which is an @xmath67 .",
    "the interpretation of these and other facts uncovered in ref.@xcite is that there are no brane sources for @xmath68 , and therefore the supergravity solution inside that radius is simply the trivial flat solution with no r ",
    "r fields switched on .",
    "the smooth interpolating region between the two solutions in the neighbourhood of the enhanon radius is described by the relatively innocuous ( but nonetheless interacting ) monopole physics .    on the one hand",
    ", this situation represents another remarkable method by which string theory rids itself of potentially troublesome singularities , while on the other hand , it potentially teaches us something about gauge theories . for example , in seeking for a limit in which the gauge theory decouples from the rest of bulk physics , we take @xmath69 while holding fixed the 2 + 1 dimensional gauge coupling given by : @xmath70 and hold fixed @xmath71 . in this limit , it was found that the metric on the moduli space , as seen by the d6d2 * probe , can be read off from the effective lagrangian for the monopole probe moving in the transverse space with coordinates @xmath72 : @xmath73 where instead of the @xmath0 which appears in the supergravity solution  ( [ sixtwo ] ) and also in the probe result exhibited in ref.@xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , there are @xmath46 d6d2 * units being probed by one separated unit , giving @xmath0 in total .",
    "the difference is a @xmath11 effect , not considered in ref.@xcite , but should be included here since we will later be discussing a family of corrections at that order . ]",
    "@xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 . here",
    ", @xmath77 and @xmath78 is a @xmath49 monopole potential .",
    "the metric in ( [ moduli ] ) is the euclidean taub ",
    "nut metric , with a negative mass .",
    "it is a hyperkhler manifold , because @xmath79 , where @xmath80 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath81 is periodic with period @xmath82 , and is the dual of the @xmath49 centre  of  mass gauge field on the 2 + 1 dimensional worldvolume of the monopole probe .",
    "this result is completely in accord with the expectation from gauge theory , being the one  loop result for the metric on moduli space , in the special case where the @xmath46 coordinates parameterising the cartan subalgebra are chosen to be equal , corresponding to making all of the branes coincident .",
    "the enhanon is at @xmath83 , and corresponds to the landau pole , representing in gauge theory the place where the one  loop correction makes the gauge coupling diverge .    in the equivalent monopole language",
    ", this is ( an approximation to ) the metric on a subspace @xmath84 ( described above eqn .",
    "( [ monopole ] ) ) of the full moduli space of @xmath0 @xmath51 monopoles .",
    "this @xmath51 is the enhanced gauge symmetry from whence comes the name `` enhanon '' .",
    "there are exponential corrections to this metric which will remove the singular behaviour and complete it into a smooth hyperkhler manifold , @xmath84 .",
    "this space generalises the atiyah ",
    "hitchin manifold , which is the metric on the relative two  monopole moduli space @xmath85 which governs the case of @xmath51 gauge theory@xcite .",
    "a natural question arises about the nature of the story for the case where one studies gauge groups other than @xmath1 .",
    "it is straightforward to construct gauge groups @xmath4 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 in perturbative string theory by combining d  branes with orientifolds . studying the wrapping of such a system on @xmath19",
    "should therefore be our first step in answering the question .",
    "let us do that .",
    "on general grounds , one expects a similar story to that which was constructed above , as all of the constituent features which are present to make the physics work as it should are still present after we insert an orientifold six  plane ( o6plane ) parallel with the d6branes .",
    "of course , the details of precisely where the enhanon is located ( corresponding to where in @xmath86 the @xmath19 volume reaches the value @xmath87 ) will be modified , but only at subleading order in @xmath0 .",
    "globally , the orientifold will also place a @xmath9 identification on @xmath86 ( @xmath9 acts by multiplying each of @xmath40 by @xmath88 ) , turning the @xmath67 of the enhanon into @xmath89 .",
    "the basic problem is to understand the nature of the supergravity solution in the presence of the orientifolds , which we will do below in a particular case .",
    "first , let us understand the physics of the perturbative string theory description , containing the weakly coupled gauge theory . for small @xmath14 ,",
    "we have @xmath0 d6branes , and an o6plane parallel to them .",
    "this gives a gauge group @xmath2 , @xmath3 or @xmath4 . in the latter case ,",
    "the o6plane has negative charge , equal to @xmath90 and is often denoted o6@xmath91 .",
    "we can obtain the former case by trapping a half d6brane on the o6@xmath91plane : this combination is often referred to as an @xmath92plane , with charge @xmath93 . in the middle case ,",
    "the o6plane has charge @xmath94 and is written o6@xmath95 . to be concise",
    ", we will use the symbol @xmath96 to denote these o6charges , measured in d2brane units .",
    "it takes the values @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "we now wrap the whole system on @xmath19 .",
    "this results in the induced d2*branes as described above , but with an additional contribution .",
    "this is due to a curvature coupling , this time on the world ",
    "volume of the o6plane@xcite , similar to eqn.([induced ] ) .",
    "the couplings are different in each case @xmath98 , o6@xmath95 , o6@xmath91 : @xmath99 which , after wrapping on @xmath19 will induce some @xmath100 charge , @xmath101 , which in d2brane units , is respectively @xmath102 .",
    "this will modify the contribution to the effective amount of d2*brane present identification on the @xmath19 part of the spacetime , which is hard to justify as the result of a smooth wrapping process .",
    "the most economical interpretation is the one presented here . ] .",
    "note that we can introduce extra ( correct sign ) d2branes parallel to the d2*branes into the story while preserving the eight supercharges .",
    "open strings stretching between these new branes and the wrapped system play the role of extra hypermultiplets in the 2 + 1 dimensional gauge theory . for @xmath103 d2branes , we have @xmath103 species of such hypermultiplets . for consistency , in the presence of the orientifold",
    ", these d2branes will have the _ opposite _ orientifold projection acting on them from that acting on the d6 s , as follows from t  duality to the situations studied in refs.@xcite .",
    "so , for example , while there is an @xmath4 ( or @xmath3 ) gauge symmetry on the d6branes , the @xmath103flavour sector has a @xmath104 ( or @xmath105 ) symmetry .",
    "this is indeed correct from the perspective of gauge theory@xcite , and this fact has featured in the physics of orientifolds before . in ref.@xcite",
    ", it was shown to correspond to the phenomenon that the orientifold must change its sign when it passes through an ns5brane .",
    "actually , one of the dual realizations of the enhanon story involves ns5branes@xcite .",
    "we display it with the inclusion of the orientifold in figure  [ bendy ] , where our case here is @xmath106 .",
    "the d3branes in the interior are dual to the d6d2 * units , while the those on the exterior ( supplying matter multiplets ) are dual to the ordinary d2branes .",
    "the orientifold runs through the whole system , having a minus sign on the interior ( giving @xmath4 ) and a plus sign on the exterior , giving @xmath104 .",
    "so we see that the sign flip of the o3plane on either side of the ns5brane is dual to the fact that the o6plane has the opposite projection on the d2 s from that on the d6 s .",
    "of course , this discussion clearly generalises to all d@xmath107branes and d@xmath107*branes with orientifolds , and the dual situation involving d@xmath16branes stretched between ns5branes with an o@xmath16plane passing through .    in this way",
    ", we see that we can consistently construct wrapped d  brane and orientifold systems giving gauge groups @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 . the amount of d2*branes induced from the wrapping is modified from @xmath25 ( for the @xmath1 case ) to @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively .",
    "the changes are to be thought of as @xmath11 corrections to the original case , and are different for each type of orientifold .",
    "we can now consider taking @xmath14 large , and expect that the phenomena which occurred for @xmath1 will happen again , giving an enhanon for each case .",
    "we shall name the types of enhanon which can occur in each situation the @xmath5type ( for @xmath1 ) , @xmath6type ( for @xmath2 ) , @xmath7type ( for @xmath3 ) and @xmath8type ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "of course , there is no natural definition of an @xmath20type , for ( at least ) two reasons : there is no known perturbative way to make @xmath111 gauge symmetry with d  branes , and furthermore , the enhanon as a smooth geometric object is a large @xmath0 phenomenon , which is incompatible with the fact that the maximum rank of the exceptional groups is eight .",
    "the next step in our story will be to write down the geometry corresponding to the large @xmath14 physics of the wrapped system of d  branes and orientifolds .",
    "the observation that we shall use to achieve this is the fact that for the o6@xmath91 case ( giving 2 + 1 dimensional @xmath4 ) , the supergravity geometry of the system can be written down accurately enough for us to make progress . along the way",
    ", we will see that we can study cases @xmath2 and @xmath3 accurately enough for our purposes using similar techniques .",
    "before we proceed to the new types , let us pause for a moment to consider the @xmath5type enhanon story in eleven dimensional terms .",
    "recall that the metric of the taub  nut space , made into an eleven dimensional supergravity solution ( by adding @xmath112 for the world  volume directions ) is ( defining an eleventh direction @xmath113 ) : @xmath114 where , with @xmath115 , @xmath116    reducing along the @xmath117circle , the relation between eleven dimensional metrics and ten dimensional type iia fields is@xcite : @xmath118 and so we recover the now standard fact@xcite that taub",

    "the wrapping induced some d2*branes , completely delocalised in the @xmath19 .",
    "we were able to probe the geometry of the supergravity solution  ( [ msoln ] ) with one of its basic constituents , a single d6d2 * bps object .    from the point of view of the eleven dimensional supergravity solution ,",
    "everything is geometry : there are no branes here .",
    "nut part lies in the 345@xmath127 directions , while @xmath19 lies in the 6789 directions .",
    "together , they act as a source for the three  form potential @xmath124 , due to the supergravity term@xcite : @xmath128 given that for taub  nut of charge @xmath0 , @xmath129 and , as stated before , for @xmath19 we know that @xmath130 , we get @xmath25 units of @xmath124 charge , as the solution shows . this fits , as ( [ minduced ] ) is the m  theory ancestor of the brane world  volume term  ( [ induced ] ) .",
    "sadly , there is no natural extended dynamical object which we can use as a candidate for the basic constituent of the geometry .",
    "thus , we can not perform a world  volume probe computation to deduce the true geometry .",
    "it is tempting to read the @xmath131 part of the geometry as representing a `` wrong sign '' m2brane which is otherwise dynamical , ( perhaps restoring a @xmath132 behaviour to make it also localised in the @xmath133 direction . )",
    "unfortunately , this can not work .",
    "the putative m2*brane necessarily would have negative tension at all locations in @xmath86 , and since there is no larger wrapped brane with positive tension to combine it with to made a positive tension object , we can not write a sensible worldvolume action .",
    "of course , a probe computation with a correct sign m2brane ( which preserves the same amount of supersymmetry ) gives a sensible result : simply the pure ( with mass parameter of @xmath134 ) taub  nut metric , as it should , with no sign of either enhanon or repulson .",
    "this is in accord with our expectation that the repulson ( still present at @xmath64 ) is an artifact , while the enhanon should be invisible to an m2brane because its world ",
    "volume theory does _ not _ relate to the @xmath1 gauge theory .",
    "to get at the enhanon , there is a pertinent supergravity question to be asked all the same : can we envision a supergravity mechanism by which the troublesome repulson singularity at @xmath64 is avoided ? in the string theory situation , we saw that the @xmath19 reached the natural value @xmath59 , before it reached its singular value ( zero ) , and the physics of the enhanced gauge symmetry took over .",
    "is there a special value for the volume of @xmath19 in this case ? here , the natural length scale is of course set by the planck length , @xmath135 , which the system again reaches before the singular value of zero . once @xmath19 has shrunk to that size",
    ", we should search for a better description than eleven dimensional supergravity .",
    "the alternative to using the full ( unknown ) m  theory is to search for a dual description .",
    "happily , eleven dimensional supergravity on such a small @xmath19 is well described@xcite by the heterotic string on @xmath136 .",
    "the distinguished @xmath117circle which is fibred to make the taub ",

    "so we see that again , stringy physics ( now heterotic ) takes over before we get to the repulson radius , and repairs the geometry with the same @xmath51 physics that we saw in type iia string theory .",

    "the space made by imposing the @xmath9 identification ( [ identification ] ) is the atiyah  hitchin space , and it is free of conical singularities .    while a closed form for the metric can not be written , for large @xmath62 the metric becomes@xcite @xmath144 where @xmath145 which we recognise as the metric for taub  nut , but with a negative mass .",
    "clearly , it can be reduced to ten dimensions in the same way as before , and we see @xcite that it has @xmath146 units of d6brane charge , which is in accord with our knowledge of the charge of an o6@xmath91plane from perturbative string theory .",
    "( the actual appearance of @xmath147 in the metric instead of @xmath148 follows from the fact that the displayed metric is the double cover of the actual solution : recall that we must divide by the @xmath9 action . )",
    "now we are in a position to construct the geometry which gives rise the the @xmath8type enhanon .",
    "we simply combine the geometry of the atiyah  hitchin manifold with that of @xmath0 coincident  centred taub  nut .",
    "the exact smooth metric certainly exists ( the @xmath149 case is known , and is dancer s manifold@xcite ) , but we need not be able to write it exactly to get at the physics we require . the radius at which the enhanon appears can be tuned to be arbitrarily large by making @xmath0 as large as we like , so we can rest assured that if we take the approximate expression for the atiyah ",
    "hitchin manifold , we can capture the essential physics for large @xmath0 .",
    "once we relax the condition of exactness , and focus on the large @xmath62 part of the solution , we can include the cases of the @xmath6 and @xmath7type enhanons . while a precise relation to a cousin of the smooth atiyah  hitchin@xmath150taub  nut geometry is not known , at large  @xmath62",
    ", the difference is immaterial , as only the leading behaviour is needed to characterise the enhanon at large enough @xmath0 .",
    "we can simply use the same supergravity solution as before , but with different numbers inserted into the @xmath11 corrections to the harmonic functions .",
    "it is clear therefore , that for all cases our solution can be written ( for large enough  @xmath62 ) in the covering space in the precise form of eqn .",
    "( [ msoln ] ) , but with the replacement of @xmath131 and @xmath151 by ( respectively ) : @xmath152 here is the same in each case .",
    "we do not know if this has any physical significance .",
    "later , in eqn .",
    "( [ newradius ] ) , we shall see that it is @xmath153 which controls the leading @xmath11 correction to the enhanon in each case .",

    "@xmath102 , and @xmath97 for types @xmath154 , respectively .",
    "we have deduced @xmath155 s asymptotic form  type case ) precisely how the harmonic function of @xmath156 gets corrected into the smooth atiyah  hitchin+taub ",
    "nut solution , we do not know how @xmath157 , which owes its presence to the @xmath19 part of the eleven dimensional geometry , gets corrected . in its current form , it must be there in order to measure the correct mass and charge at large @xmath62 , but the small @xmath62 details are unknown to us . ] from the fact that it must give the correct induced d2*brane mass and charge at large @xmath62 in the string theory limit .",
    "this should be taken to mean the metric on the covering space of our solution , and we must divide by the @xmath9 action in order to reconstruct the correct solution , as before .",
    "this also accounts for the factors of two we have inserted into the harmonic functions .",
    "notice that the contribution to the harmonic functions of ( what will become ) the orientifolds is simply a  @xmath11 correction to the geometry .",
    "this will turn into part of the family of @xmath11 corrections to the location and shape of the enhanon locus , once we return to string theory .",
    "the final step is clear .",
    "we return to type iia string theory by reducing on the @xmath117circle , recovering a supergravity solution representing the large @xmath14 geometry of system of wrapped d6brane and and o6@xmath91plane , as promised in section 2 .",
    "the solution is simply the geometry ( [ sixtwo ] ) with @xmath158 and @xmath159 replaced by their @xmath11 corrected counterparts in ( [ corrected ] ) with the factors of @xmath15 and @xmath160 removed . crucially , there is a @xmath9 identification on the @xmath142 directions , making it globally distinct from the @xmath5type case , in addition to the different structure of the subleading behaviour in @xmath0 .",
    "again , in string theory , the natural object to construct this geometry out of is the d6d2 * at large @xmath14 , now in the presence of an orientifold , and we may examine the nature of the geometry as seen by the probe by a computation precisely along the lines of ref.@xcite . the structure of the computation is almost identical to that carried out there , and we refer the reader to that work for the details .",
    "a crucial difference is that we are working on the _ covering space _ of the actual geometry , and so we should insert a mirror image of the probe at the image position obtained by reflecting through the orientifold fixed point .",
    "the result is structurally identical : @xmath161 where now @xmath162 with @xmath163 where we have shifted @xmath0 to @xmath46 to represent separating off the probe ( see footnote 1 ) . here",
    ", @xmath164 is the fourth modulus obtained by dualising the world ",
    "volume centre of mass gauge field .",
    "the location @xmath165 of the @xmath8type enhanon can be read off as the place in @xmath62 where the mass of the probe becomes zero ( equivalent to @xmath166 ) : @xmath167 with @xmath168 in each case @xmath154 .",
    "( the analogous expression for the @xmath5 case with the @xmath11 correction from separating off the probe ( _ c.f . _ eqn .  (",
    "[ enhanced])) has @xmath169 .",
    "note that for case @xmath6 the effect of the o6plane is precisely cancelled by the effect of the d2*brane contribution which is produces from wrapping , giving the same leading @xmath11 contribution as for type @xmath5 . )",
    "correspondingly , when we take the limit where we decouple the gauge theory with @xmath170 holding @xmath171 fixed , we recover the prediction for the metric on the moduli space of the gauge theory at large @xmath0 ( in the coincident limit ) : @xmath172 where @xmath173 this is the one  loop expression for the metric on moduli space for the @xmath2 , @xmath3 or @xmath4 2 + 1 dimensional gauge theory . on general grounds ,",
    "the classical moduli space has the geometry @xmath174 where there is a natural @xmath9 action reflecting the @xmath0 eigenvalues into ( minus ) themselves . in the subspace where we set all the vev s ( but four ) to be equal ,",
    "we are reduced to @xmath175 for the classical moduli space .",
    "our metric above , with the @xmath9 action ( imposed , recall , for smoothness of the atiyah",
    " hitchin manifold representing the o6@xmath91plane ) , is the one  loop expression for the metric on the full moduli space .",
    "finally , we point out that once again , these results have a dual interpretation as an approximate result for the metric on moduli space of @xmath0 monopoles@xcite . this time",
    ", they are monopoles of a spontaneously broken @xmath51 theory which has an identification by @xmath9 , which can be understood as follows : the relation between the moduli space of @xmath22 dimensional gauge theories and that of monopoles is readily seen in the string realization of such theories by d3branes stretched between ns5branes@xcite .",
    "the spontaneously broken @xmath51 lives on the world  volume of the ns5branes .",
    "the ends of the d3branes in the ns5brane worldvolumes are the monopoles .",
    "we need only look at the orientifolded version of that picture , drawn in figure  1 , to see the origin of the @xmath9 action on the @xmath51 theory . by passing through the world ",
    "volume of the ns5branes , the o3plane places a spacetime @xmath9 identification on the @xmath51 gauge theory .",
    "the enhanon locus which appears in the study of spacetime geometry associated to @xmath1 @xmath16dimensional gauge theory ( at large @xmath0 ) with eight supercharges has three natural counterparts : those pertaining to @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 gauge theory .",
    "the four classes deserve to be called types @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "( there is no natural @xmath20type which has a smooth geometrical interpretation , since the rank of those groups can not be made arbitrarily large . )",
    "we presented the general scenario for the case of @xmath16dimensions and exhibited and studied the orientifolded enhanon for the case of 2 + 1 dimensional gauge theory .",
    "guided by the case of the @xmath8type , where the fact that the o6@xmath91plane has a known eleven dimensional supergravity description in terms of the atiyah ",
    "hitchin manifold , we were able to study aspects of all three new types : while the atiyah  hitchin manifold can not be written explicitly , it reduces to ( negative mass ) taub  nut at large @xmath62 ( up to exponentially small corrections in @xmath62 ) which was enough for us to study explicitly the relevant features of the supergravity solution which results from placing many d6branes and an o6plane on @xmath19 .",
    "this multi  taub ",
    "nut solution can also be reliably modified to capture the local asymptotic behaviour of the @xmath6 and @xmath7type cases .",
    "the atiyah ",
    "hitchin structure imposes a global @xmath9 identification on the entire geometry .",
    "correspondingly , we found that there is a global @xmath9 identification inherited by the enhanon locus , making the enhanon a natural @xmath176 geometry , in contrast to the @xmath67 geometry of the @xmath5type .",
    "( we should also note that we observed that in all cases @xmath177 or @xmath8 , the apparent repulson singularity in eleven dimensional supergravity is naturally removed ; not by m ",
    "branes , but by being forced back to ten dimensional heterotic string theory because the @xmath19 becomes small .",
    "the heterotic string phenomena dual to the enhanon@xcite then take over the description . )",
    "we displayed some leading @xmath11 corrections to the location of the all three types of orientifolded enhanon , as compared to the location of the @xmath5type , and hence also the @xmath11 corrections to the one  loop metric on moduli space .",
    "note that the @xmath5type enhanon already has a series of exponential corrections of the form @xmath178 . on general grounds ,",
    "our new types have a similar class of corrections , which can be phrased in terms of field theory instanton corrections@xcite , and equivalently , in terms of corrections from d1brane world  sheets@xcite .",
    "it is amusing to note that the @xmath11 corrections we studied here , which are of a different type , can all be written in terms of exponential corrections too .",
    "this follows from the fact that the part of the geometry of the atiyah  hitchin ( like ) manifold that we neglected in writing the explicit supergravity solution is a series of exponential corrections in @xmath62 .",
    "these corrections should also have an interpretation in terms of an instanton problem .",
    "perhaps one can always organise the exponential corrections to these geometries in terms of structures reminiscent of the geometry of the atiyah ",
