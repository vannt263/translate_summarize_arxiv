    "randomness is commonly used in the design of multiple - access schemes .",
    "for example , in slotted aloha , each user transmits a packet with probability @xmath0 independently .",
    "implementations of such random access schemes in practice usually substitute random variables by pseudo - random numbers .",
    "however , high - quality pseudo - random number generation may be too complicated for applications , such as wireless sensor networks , where computing power is limited .",
    "the objective of this paper is to construct binary pseudo - random sequences , called protocol sequences , that are tailored to the quality - of - service requirements of interest , such as high throughput and bounded delay .",
    "protocol sequences are used in multiple - access in the collision channel without feedback  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider a time - slotted system , consisting of a number of transmitters and one receiver .",
    "a user sends a packet within the boundaries of a time slot .",
    "if exactly one user transmits in a time slot , the received packet is received successfully .",
    "if two or more users transmit in the same time slot , a collision is incurred , and the received packet is assumed unrecoverable . if no user transmits in a time slot , that time slot is idle . since there is no feedback from the receiver , collision resolution algorithm such as the stack algorithm is not possible .",
    "each user repeats his assigned binary protocol sequence periodically , and transmits a packet if and only if the value of the protocol sequence at that time slot equals one .",
    "we note that the transmission schedule is independent of the data being sent and there is no cooperation among the users .",
    "the capacity of the collision channel without feedback is characterized by massey and mathys in  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the zero - error sum - capacity is @xmath1 .",
    "they use protocol sequences having the special property that the hamming cross - correlation is independent of relative delay offsets .",
    "in fact , the hamming cross - correlation they considered is a generalized notion of hamming cross - correlation , which is defined for all nonempty subsets of users , not just for pairs of users .",
    "protocol sequences with this property are called _ shift - invariant _ sequences  @xcite .",
    "shift - invariant protocol sequences have the advantage that there is no fluctuation in throughput no matter what the delay offsets are , and hence have the largest worst - case system throughput .",
    "constructions of shift - invariant protocol sequences are considered in  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , shift - invariant protocol sequences have the drawback that the period grows exponentially in the number of users  @xcite . even if we relax this requirement and consider protocol sequence sets with only pairwise hamming cross - correlation being constant , it is shown in  @xcite that the period grows exponentially in the number of users as well .",
    "long period length has the disadvantage that individual or system throughput is invariant only if it is averaged over a long period .",
    "individual users may suffer short - time starvation . in order to achieve short period length ,",
    "we must seek for protocol sequences with some small variance in hamming cross - correlation allowed .",
    "after the seminal work of  @xcite , more constructions of protocol sequences are given in  @xcite , sometime under the name of _ cyclically permutable constant - weight codes _ , or _",
    "optical orthogonal codes_. the main difference between these works in the literature and our construction is that , the protocol sequences in these papers are required to have small hamming cross - correlation and auto - correlation . in our construction , hamming auto - correlation may be very large .    another class of protocol sequences , called _ wobbling sequences _",
    "@xcite , has period equal to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of users , with worst - case system throughput provably larger than a positive constant that is approximately equal to 0.25 when @xmath3 is large .",
    "the result in this paper improves upon the wobbling sequences by constructing protocol sequences of order @xmath4 or @xmath5 , depending on the models of user activity , while the guarantee of the worst - case system throughput remains the same .",
    "the construction proposed in this paper is based on the chinese remainder theorem ( crt ) , and thereby the constructed sequences are called _",
    "crt sequences_. we remark that the use of crt in the construction of protocol sequences is not new .",
    "the constructions of optical orthogonal codes in  @xcite also employ crt .",
    "however , the specific construction proposed here is novel .",
    "although the analysis of crt sequences is quite involved , the generation of such sequences requires no more than computing linear operations in modular arithmetics    the proposed crt sequences have two special features , _ user - identification _ and _ frame - synchronization _ capability .",
    "the sender of each successfully received packet can be identified by looking at the channel activity only , without looking into the packet contents .",
    "also , we can determine the start time of a protocol sequence , again , based on the channel activity only .",
    "one potential application based on this property is tracking targets by detecting energy pulses coming from multiple distributed sources , for example , as in a multistatic radar system or in a ultrasound based sensor network .",
    "while it may be difficult to identify the transmitting source of a single pulse , if each source employs a crt sequence and sends multiple pulses according to the corresponding protocol sequence , then the identifiability property ensures that a detector can identify the transmitting sources of the pulses and make use of the information for more accurate tracking of the targets .",
    "the main construction is given in section  [ sec : crt ] .",
    "one of the key ingredients in the construction is the one - to - one correspondence between one - dimensional sequence and two - dimensional arrays via crt .",
    "the correlation property of the constructed sequences is analyzed in section  [ sec : cross - correlation ] .",
    "applications to the collision channel without feedback are addressed in section  [ sec : throughput ] with two different user activity models  @xcite . in the first model , an infinite backlog of data",
    "is assumed and the users are active throughout the transmission .",
    "we show in theorem  [ thm : throughput1 ] that under this user activity model , we can achieve a throughput of 0.25 with @xmath6 sequence period , where @xmath3 is the number of users .    in the second model ,",
    "users become active only if they have data to send , and remain idle otherwise .",
    "if a user becomes active , it is required that the user remains active for at least one period of the protocol sequence assigned .",
    "we show in the second part of section  [ sec : throughput ] that if the number of active users is no more than one half of the number of potential users , and if the protocol sequences are sufficiently long , namely @xmath5 , the receiver can detect the set of active users and determine their starting time correctly , even without any packet header .    to facilitate comparison between different protocol sequences , we introduce in section  [ sec : uniform ] a notion called @xmath7-uniformity , which measures the variation of hamming cross - correlation .",
