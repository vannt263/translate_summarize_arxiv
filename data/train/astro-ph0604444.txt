    "selection biases have had a serious influence in our understanding of the universe .",
    "this is especially true with regards to star formation in the local universe .",
    "attempts at a global census of star formation depend critically on the limitations of the methods used .",
    "for example , prism - based emission line samples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are biased toward systems with high equivalent widths ; ultraviolet ( uv ) selected samples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are biased against very dusty systems ; and far - infrared ( fir ) selected samples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are biased against low - dust ( and perhaps low - metallicity ) systems .",
    "broad - band optical surveys have a well - known bias against low surface brightness ( lsb ) systems @xcite that are at least as common as normal and `` starburst '' galaxies @xcite .",
    "conversely , the techniques used to discover lsb systems tend to discard compact and high surface brightness galaxies @xcite , as do surveys that distinguish galaxies from stars by optical structure @xcite .",
    "broad - band surveys from the optical , uv , and infrared also suffer from spectroscopic incompleteness .",
    "the missed galaxies are typically faint , may be at low distances , and hence may make major contributions to the faint end of the luminosity function .",
    "large fiber - spectroscopy surveys such as 2df @xcite and sdss @xcite are affected by the selection function for placing fibers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , large aperture corrections ( which are variable even for galaxies of similar morphology ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; hereafter b04 ) , `` fiber collisions '' @xcite , and the requirements for classification as `` star forming '' ( b04 ) .",
    "while these effects are mostly small and well studied ( e.g.  b04 ) , they may still introduce subtle biases in our understanding of the phenomenology of extra - galactic star formation .",
    "finally , the different tracers of star formation ( uv , fir , , x - ray and radio emission ) result from different physical processes , and often trace different masses of stars .",
    "imprecise knowledge of the physics of these processes and particularly the initial mass function ( imf ) may result in systematic errors in the star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "a more complete census of star formation in the local universe would be sensitive to all types of star - forming galaxies . here",
    "we report initial results from the survey for ionization in neutral gas galaxies ( singg ) , which we will show meets this requirement .",
    "singg surveys hi - selected galaxies in the light of  and the @xmath0-band continuum . traces the presence of the highest mass stars ( @xmath2 ) through their ability to ionize the interstellar medium ( ism ) . for any metallicity ,  ( at rest wavelength @xmath3 )",
    "is one of the main emission line coolants in star forming regions and typically the strongest at optical wavelength .",
    "the modest typical levels of extinction ( @xmath4 mag ) found in previous  surveys @xcite suggest that dust absorption corrections are manageable , perhaps even in extremely dusty systems @xcite .",
    "the starting point for singg is the recently completed hi  parkes all - sky survey ( hipass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the largest survey to select galaxies entirely by their hi  21-cm emission . @xcite have also obtained @xmath0 and  observations ( as well as @xmath5 band data ) of a sample of hipass  galaxies similar in number to those whose images we present here . since",
    "their goals were more oriented toward studying low surface - brightness galaxies , their sample selection was less comprehensive than ours .",
    "our sample is more inclusive , for instance having no angle of inclination selection , and our observations generally have higher quality and are deeper .",
    "because interstellar hydrogen is the essential fuel for star formation , hipass  is an ideal sample to use in star formation surveys .",
    "hi  redshifts are available for all sources thus allowing a consistent measurement of distance .",
    "furthermore , because it is a radio - selected survey , it is not directly biased by optical properties such as luminosity , surface brightness , or hubble type . instead , the distribution of these properties that we find will be determined by their dependence on the hi  selection criteria we adopt .",
    "this paper describes singg and presents initial results for a subsample of targets .",
    "section [ s : samp ] describes the sample selection process and lists the full singg sample .",
    "the rest of the paper concentrates on the first sub - sample of singg data that has been fully reduced and analyzed .",
    "it consists of 93 singg targets observed over four observing runs .",
    "since we are releasing these data , with the publication of this paper , we refer to this data set as singg release 1 , or sr1 .",
    "section [ s : data ] describes the sr1 data and their reduction and analysis .",
    "a database of the measured properties is presented in section [ s : measres ] which includes a detailed discussion of data quality and errors .",
    "science results are discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : results ] .",
    "chief among them is that all targets in sr1 are detected in .",
    "these cover a wide range in  luminosity , surface brightness and equivalent width , verifying that an hi - selected sample is well suited for star formation surveys .",
    "we discuss the implications of this result and how the relationship between star formation and hi  may arise .",
    "the paper is summarized in sec .",

    "the full list of singg targets was selected from hipass  source catalogs .",
    "hipass  used the 64-m parkes radio telescope with a multibeam receiver @xcite to map the entire southern sky for neutral hydrogen emission from -1280 to 12,700  in heliocentric radial velocity ( ) .",
    "the original survey , and the source catalogs used for singg , extend from @xmath690  to @xmath72  in declination .",
    "the northern extension of the survey , @xmath72  to @xmath725  in declination , has recently been cataloged @xcite .",
    "processing of the hipass  data resulted in cubes 8  @xmath8 8  in size with a velocity resolution of 18.0 , a spatial resolution of @xmath9 , and a 3@xmath10 limiting flux of 40 mjy beam@xmath11 .",
    "@xcite determined the completeness of the survey using a fake source analysis : fake sources were inserted into the hipass  data cubes and the hipass source finder was used to determine whether the source was detected .",
    "the fake sources had a wide range of peak fluxes , integrated fluxes , random velocities , and a variety of velocity profile shapes ( gaussian , double - horn , and flat - top ) and fwhm velocity widths ranging from 20 to 650 . integrated over all profile shapes and widths , the 95%completeness level for integrated flux is @xmath12 @xcite and corresponds to an hi  mass limit of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the distance in mpc .",
    "the details of the observing and reduction methods of hipass are outlined in @xcite . in this section",
    "we describe how the full singg sample was chosen from the hipass catalogs , while the rest of the paper focuses on the targets comprising sr1 .",
    "the primary goal of singg is to uniformly survey the star formation properties of hi - selected galaxies across the entire hi  mass function sampled by hipass  in a way that is blind to previously known optical properties of the sources .",
    "an essential aspect of the project is its ability to measure not only mean star formation quantities , but also the distribution about the mean among galaxies of different hi  mass ( ) , hubble type , surface brightness , and environment .",
    "our goal is to image 180 targets per decade of .",
    "the available sources found by hipass  allow this goal to be obtained over the mass range @xmath15 to 10.6 . a sample this size allows the width in the  emissivity ( @xmath16 , where  and  are the integrated  and hi  fluxes ) distribution to be measured to statistical accuracy better than 10%  per decade of  and allows sensitive tests for non - gaussian distributions .",
    "this is important for testing models such as the stochastic self - propagating star formation scenario of @xcite which predicts a wider range of star - formation properties with decreasing galaxy mass .",
    "a large sample also makes the selection of rare systems more likely , including extreme starburst and dormant systems .",

    ", we created a set of normalized correction images .",
    "for each affected run , at least 15 object images using the 6568/28 filter were selected , preferably those where the target galaxy was small , and did not extend into the hump region .",
    "each image was masked for bad pixels , smoothed with a 7@xmath87 box median to remove cosmic rays , sky subtracted and then normalized to have a peak in the hump of 1.0 .",
    "the images for each observing run were then combined ( with rejection ) to remove stars , galaxies , and other sources , and the resulting image was again median - smoothed ( 9@xmath89 ) to remove any remaining artifacts of the combine process .",
    "each affected image was manually adjusted by subtracting a scaled version of this correction image .",
    "typically , the scaling was determined from the intensities of @xmath38 2500 pixels surrounding the brightest point of the feature , after a first pass background sky subtraction .",

    "continuum subtraction is performed using the algorithm given by @xcite .",
    "the frame with the best seeing is convolved with a kernel that matches it to the psf of the frame with the worst seeing , and the scaled continuum image is subtracted from the nb frame .",
    "the flux scaling is implemented by setting the sum of the convolution kernel to the appropriate scale factor .",
    "se catalogs were matched to the u.s .",
    "naval observatory a2.0 database @xcite .",
    "typically , on the order of 100 sources were matched resulting in an rms accuracy of @xmath380.4  ( about one pixel ) to the coordinate system zeropoint .",
    "identification of emission line galaxies ( elgs ) was done visually using color composite images .",

    "this assignment is used in all color images presented here .",
    "the display levels are scaled to the noise level in the frames allowing sources to be discerned to a consistent significance level in all images .",
    "we define an elg to be a discrete source that is noticeably extended in at least the @xmath0-band and contains at least one emission line source .",
    "this phenomenological definition is deliberately broad and allows an extended galaxy with one unresolved hii  region to be considered an elg .",
    "the aim is to find any star - forming galaxies associated with the hisource .",
    "however , we can not be certain that the elgs correspond to the location of hi  within the parkes beam .",
    "similarly , we could also detect background sources in some other emission line redshifted into the passband of the nb filter ( e.g.  5007 , , or 3727  at @xmath44 0.3 , 0.4 , and 0.8 respectively ) .",
    "further spectroscopic and hi  imaging follow - up would be required to unequivocally determine which elgs are associated with the hipasssources . despite these concerns , the rich morphology of extended distributions of hii  region in the vast majority of the elgs is consistent with them being associated with the hipass  targets .",
    "we also frequently find emission line sources that are unresolved or barely resolved in both the @xmath0 and nb images and projected far from any apparent host galaxies .",
    "we classified these sources as `` eldots '' which is a phenomenological shorthand description for their appearance - emission line dots .",
    "the nature of the eldots is not immediately apparent ; they could be outlying hii  regions in the targeted galaxy , or background line emitters .",

    "we determine the sky level in an annulus around the galaxy that is set interactively .",
    "we use color images to define the brightness peak as well as four points that specify the major and minor axes of the aperture that encompasses all the apparent emission in both  and the @xmath0 band . in most cases",

    "the semi - major axis size parameterizes the inner size of the sky annulus .",
    "next ,  is tweaked using crude radial surface brightness profiles ; the images are divided into @xmath45 pixel boxes , the 3@xmath10 clipped mean level of each box is plotted as a function of semi - major axis distance , and the distance at which the mean intensity levels off in both the net and @xmath0 band images is selected as the new . in some cases there are slight radial gradients in the sky , due to scattered light , and the mean intensity level does not level off . in those cases",
    "we do not reset .",
    "the outer sky radius is set so that the sky annulus has an area equal to that interior to .",
    "the exceptions are very large galaxies , where the available sky area is limited by the ccd boundaries , and small galaxies , where we set the minimum area to 16 arcmin@xmath46 .",
    "the sky level is the 3@xmath10 clipped average of the mean level in each box wholly within the sky annulus , rejecting boxes that have had pixels rejected in the clipping within the box .",
    "the pixel - to - pixel noise of each image is taken to be the average clipped rms values within the boxes .",
    "the large scale ( @xmath47 35 pixels ) uncertainty in the sky is taken as the dispersion in the mean levels in the boxes used to define the sky ; this represents the uncertainty due to imperfect flat - fielding and scattered light .",
    "we use two types of masks , exclusion and inclusion , to indicate how to use pixels when integrating fluxes .",
    "these masks rely heavily on se catalogs as well as `` segmentation images '' produced by se which indicate which source each pixel belongs to .    for the @xmath0 and nb images",
    ", the exclusion mask uses the position , se flag values , source size , stellarity parameter ( star / galaxy classification ) , flux , and @xmath0/nb flux ratio to identify the pixels to exclude .",
    "the se segmentation image is displayed , and allows interactive toggling of which sources are masked or kept . to make the final exclusion mask ,",
    "this mask is grown by convolving it with a circular top hat function with a radius equal to the seeing width ( or a minimum of 1.2 ) so that the fringes of unrelated stars and galaxies are also rejected .",
    "the net h@xmath48 image requires less exclusion masking , because most of the faint foreground and background sources are adequately removed with continuum subtraction .",
    "our algorithm uses the uncertainty in the continuum scaling ratio to determine which pixels masked in the @xmath0-band are likely to have residuals greater than 1.5 times the pixel - pixel sky noise .",
    "in addition , we exclude pixels corresponding to concave sources resulting from residuals around bright stars . the bad pixels are grown as described above to make the final  exclusion mask .",
    "the inclusion mask is needed primarily to account for hii  regions that are detached from the main body of a galaxy . in many cases ,",
    "a simple aperture that is large enough to include all of a large galaxy s hii   regions would result in a sky uncertainty that is so big that the derived total flux would be meaningless .",
    "the inclusion mask is based on an se analysis of the net  image .",
    "we use a logic similar to that adopted to find sources that are most likely foreground , background , or artifacts , and take all other sources to be part of the galaxy being measured .",
    "the grow radius of the inclusion mask is twice the seeing width or a minimum of 2.4 .",
    "the algorithm for defining the masks is straight forward but not perfect .",
    "objects at the edge of frames , satellite trail residuals , and the wings of bright stars are sometimes mistakenly placed in inclusion masks , while occasionally portions of the target galaxy , such as line - free knots , are excluded .",
    "therefore , each set of masks were examined by two of us ( g.r.m .  and d.j.h . ) .",
    "this was done by examining color images of ( a ) the entire field , ( b ) only the pixels included in total @xmath0 band flux measurements , ( c ) only the pixels not included in total @xmath0 flux measurements , ( d ) only the pixels included in the net flux , and ( e ) only the pixels not included in the total  flux .",
    "these images were compared to determine if there were regions that should or should nt be included in the masks . mistakenly excluded or included se sources were toggled . in some cases circular or polygon",
    "shaped areas were added as needed to the masks to insure that the measurements recover as much of the true flux while excluding obvious contaminating features .",
    "the ideal way to measure total  fluxes is to just use a simple aperture ( e.g.  circular or elliptical ) that is large enough to encompass all hii  emission .",
    "in addition to being easy to specify , this technique has the advantage of including all emission in the aperture , including that from faint hii  regions and diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) that may be below the apparent detection limit of the observations .",
    "in contrast , measuring  fluxes by summing the light from hii regions typically underestimates the true flux by 30%  50%  because of the neglected dig @xcite .",
    "however , as alluded to above , using large apertures may result in very low s / n due to the sky uncertainty over the very large aperture needed to contain the outermost hii  regions .",
    "we have developed a hybrid approach that uses the sum of the aperture flux where the s / n level is reasonable , supplemented with the flux of hii  regions outside of this aperture that are within the inclusion mask described above .",
    "the method is similar in concept to that employed by @xcite .",
    "surface brightness and curve of growth ( enclosed flux ) profiles are extracted for each source using concentric , constant shape elliptical apertures .",
    "the shape and centers of the apertures are the same as those set in the sky determination .",
    "the difference in flux between apertures defines the surface brightness profile .",
    "the curve of growth profiles are corrected for the excluded pixels in each annulus by adding the missing area times the mean unmasked intensity in the annulus . in the majority of elgs ( 96 of 111 ) the curve of growth plateaus at or very close , and",
    "we terminate the profiles at a maximum radius @xmath49 . in some cases the profiles plateau inwards of , or the @xmath25 of the enclosed flux",
    "hence , our adopted algorithm for determining  is to use the smallest of ( a ) where the curve of growth flattens , ( b ) , or ( c ) where @xmath50 . here",
    "the noise is crudely estimated from the large scale sky variation ( sec .",

    "[ s : fluxerr ] below , this overestimates the error in the enclosed flux , hence the actual @xmath25 is higher ) . beyond",
    ", we still include the flux of pixels indicated by the inclusion mask in our total flux measurements .",
    "figure  [ f : exmask ] shows an example of how pixels are masked and which pixels are included when measuring total  fluxes .",
    "we find some  flux outside of  in 30%  of the elgs studied here .",
    "however , in most cases the fractional  flux outside of  is negligible ; it is greater than 0.1 , 0.05 , 0.01 in 3 , 6 , and 16 cases respectively .",
    "the most extreme case is hipassj1217@xmath700 ( fig .",

    "the use of improved stellar models should then move the model lines in the correct direction .",
    "it is also possible that older populations could also contribute significantly to the dust heating , but not the ionization .",
    "these could result from a star formation history that is declining with time .",
    "this would be in the correct sense compared to compilations of the cosmic sfr density evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , the offset could be due to the inadequacy of the dust model to account for all star formation .",
    "then , the fact that our balmer - decrement based models do nt recover this star formation would indicate that it is totally hidden by dust .",
    "our model adequately models the trend of the  extinction for galaxies having @xmath76 abmag , but is not capable of self - consistently accounting for the fir emission .",
    "the singg elgs that have been detected by iras are on average 2.7 , 4.8 times brighter in the fir than predicted by our model for galaxies less and more luminous than @xmath80 abmag respectively .",
    "as noted above there are a variety of explanations for this offset .",
    "if the zeropoint offset is removed , then at the faint end , our dust absorption model predicts the @xmath81 ratio , and by inference the sfr , to within an a factor of 1.7 .",
    "this is sufficient for our purposes - we wish to determine star formation rates that can be inferred from  fluxes and quantities that can be inferred from optical wavelength observations .",
    "recovery of the star formation that is totally obscured by dust , is beyond the scope of this survey .",
    "our adopted dust absorption model is conservative in that it does not over - predict the fir emission .",
    "since hii  regions represent star formation sites , where dust and gas concentrations are particularly strong , they represent enhanced dust absorption compared to that seen in the older stellar populations in the galaxy .",

    "what we need is a correction for  absorption appropriate to the integrated spectra of galaxies . for this",
    "we turn to the sdss , whose fiber spectra typically account for one third of the flux in nearby galaxies , as shown by b04 .",
    "they show that adopting a uniform  absorption correction corresponding to @xmath87  could cause systematic errors in sfr determinations with stellar mass .",

    "since the nb filters and continuum filters have similar mean wavelengths , and to first order the spectral properties of foreground and background sources should not vary significantly from field to field at the high latitudes of our survey , then we take the fractional error due to continuum subtraction , @xmath143 to be the field to field dispersion in the continuum scaling ratio normalized by the mean continuum ratio .",

    "<S> the survey consists of  and @xmath0-band imaging of a sample of 468 galaxies selected from the hi  parkes all sky survey ( hipass ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sample spans three decades in hi  mass and is free of many of the biases that affect other star forming galaxy samples . </S>",
    "<S> we present the criteria for sample selection , list the entire sample , discuss our observational techniques , and describe the data reduction and calibration methods . </S>",
    "<S> this paper focuses on 93 singg targets whose observations have been fully reduced and analyzed to date . </S>",
    "<S> the majority of these show a single emission line galaxy ( elg ) . </S>",
    "<S> we see multiple elgs in 13 fields , with up to four elgs in a single field . </S>",
    "<S> all of the targets in this sample are detected in  indicating that dormant ( non - star - forming ) galaxies with @xmath1 are very rare . </S>",
    "<S> a database of the measured global properties of the elgs is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the elg sample spans four orders of magnitude in luminosity (  and @xmath0-band ) , and surface brightness , nearly three orders of magnitude in @xmath0 surface brightness and nearly two orders of magnitude in  equivalent width ( ew ) . </S>",
    "<S> the surface brightness distribution of our sample is broader than that of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spectroscopic sample , the ew distribution is broader than prism - selected samples , and the morphologies found include all common types of star forming galaxies ( e.g.  irregular , spiral , blue compact dwarf , starbursts , merging and colliding systems , and even residual star formation in s0 and sa spirals ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus singg presents a superior census of star formation in the local universe suitable for further studies ranging from the analysis of hii  regions to determination of the local cosmic star formation rate density . </S>"
