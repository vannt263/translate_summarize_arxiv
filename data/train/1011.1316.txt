    "the soliton is ubiquitous in nature and its existence is due to the balance of two physical features , the dispersion and the nonlinearity in a nonlinear system , as observed by zabusky and kruskal @xcite .",
    "the particle - like nature of the soliton has attracted much attention in the last decades since its potential application in optical soliton communication @xcite and its rich dynamics shown in different systems .",
    "particularly , the realization of the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in 1995 @xcite provided an ideal ground to study the dynamics of the soliton by using the feshbach resonance @xcite , a technique to change the scattering length of atoms , and by tuning the harmonic external potential applied .",
    "this system can be well described by the so - called nonautonomous nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation with the harmonic external potential .",
    "the dynamics of the soliton governed by this equation shows quite complicated behavior in comparison with its canonical counterpart @xcite . while some early studies @xcite have already broken the concept of the canonical soliton , the study of exact soliton - like solutions of nonautonomous nls equation and discussion of their nature have attracted much attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "after the systematic ways to find the exact soliton - like solutions of the nonautonomous nls equation have been proposed @xcite , the attention has been focused on the nature of the solutions obtained . in 2003 , kruglov et al . argued that the self - similar solutions they obtained were not soliton solutions because of the non - integrability of the equation . however , under certain conditions the nonautonomous nls equation is integrable @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these soliton - like solutions are quite different from the canonical ones , they move with varying amplitudes and speeds .",
    "thus serkin , hasegawa and belyaeva @xcite proposed the concept of nonautonomous soliton . thus a question arises naturally : could the nonautonomous and canonical solitons be viewed in a unified way ?    in this paper",
    "we indicate that the unified view is actually the concept of balance between different features .",
    "first of all , we consider the single - component gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation with the time - dependent dispersion , nonlinearity and harmonic external potential . although the integrability condition of this equation has been obtained in the literature @xcite , its physical meanings has not been discussed in a deep way . here",
    "we point out that in the presence of harmonic external potential such as bec , the stability of the nonautonomous soliton can be attributed to two kinds of competitions and their balance .",
    "one is the competition between the nonlinearity and the dispersion , which is the standard one , and the other is the competition between the kinetic energy ( dispersion ) and the harmonic external potential .",
    "the latter one has not been pointed out explicitly in the literature . to further deepen understanding of the picture",
    ", we consider two - component gp equation , which includes the intra- and inter - interactions .",
    "the procedure obtaining the integrability condition by using the painlev analysis @xcite in this case is proved to be nontrivial but the result is physically straightforward , namely , for each component the competition between the kinetic and potential energies balance the competitions between all possible combinations of the dispersion and nonlinearity including intra- and inter - components ( see below ) .",
    "this result shows sufficiently that nonautonomous soliton and its canonical counterpart can be viewed in a unified way from the point of view of balance .",
    "finally , based on the integrability condition in two - component case we explore the dynamics of nonautonomous two solitons and the spatial separation of binary becs in both integrable and non - integrable cases .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we reformulate the integrability condition of single - component nonautonomous nls case . in section iii",
    "we explore the integrability for the double - component case .",
    "the integrability condition is composed of the combinations of different competition features , in which the basic form is similar to the single - component case . in section",
    "iv we consider some applications in obtaining nonautonomous soliton solution of the two - component nonautonomous nls equation and phase separation of binary becs .",
    "finally , section v is devoted to a brief summary .",
    "below we first consider the one - dimensional nonautonomous nls equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are dispersion and nonlinearity coefficients in the standard nls equation and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are dispersion and nonlinearity managements , respectively .",
    "@xmath5 is the time - dependent harmonic external potential .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) has been extensively studied in the literature by various methods like the lax pair @xcite and the similarity transformation @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we used the painlev analysis to explore the integrability condition of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and proposed a systematic way to find the exact solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) directly from the known solutions of the standard nls equation .",
    "these solutions can be obtained only under the integrability condition @xmath6 eq . ( [ eq2 ] ) is proved to be equivalent to that in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the absence of the harmonic external potential , eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) is reduced to the balance condition between the dispersion and nonlinearity . in this case , one obtains @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are two constants determined by the initial dispersion and nonlinearity .",
    "if one takes @xmath10 and @xmath11 , then @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) clearly manifests the balance between the dispersion and nonlinearity .",
    "in contrast to the canonical case both the dispersion and nonlinearity can be time - dependent but the system is still integrable and the soliton keeps stable while its shape and velocity change , as shown in ref .",
    "when the external potential is present , as in the case of bec , it can be balanced by the kinetic energy ( dispersion term ) , as shown in the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) . as a result ,",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) can be viewed as the competitions between the kinetic energy and external potential and between the dispersion and nonlinearity .",
    "this can be further demonstrated by considering two - component nonautonomous nls equation below .",
    "the balance can be further clarified by considering two - component nls equation @xmath14 where the subscripts @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the two components , respectively . as in the single component case ,",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 represent the time - dependent dispersion and nonlinearity in the intra - component and @xmath19 is the harmonic external potential .",
    "besides the intra - component interaction , there is also inter - component interaction @xmath20 .    to explore the integrability of eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) we follow the painlev analysis @xcite .",
    "first of all one can expand @xmath21 and their complex conjugate @xmath22 on a non - characteristic singularity manifold @xmath23 as follows @xmath24 inserting eqs .",
    "( [ eq5a ] ) and ( [ eq5b ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , performing the standard leading - order analysis and studying the polynomial of @xmath25 , one obtain the compatibility condition for the two - component nls equation as follows @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be obtained by exchanging the indices of @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the expressions of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is complicated but there is a simple picture , it consists of the balances between the kinetic energy and potential energy and the possible pairs of dispersions and nonlinearities in the two - component system , namely , @xmath37",
    "@xmath38 with harmonic external potential . ]    here the expression of each @xmath39 is obtained by interchanging the subscripts of 1 and 2 of the left term given in each row correspondingly in the right of the above equation , and @xmath40 .",
    "four @xmath41 functions for the component @xmath32 read @xmath42 respectively . by the similar way , the @xmath41 functions of the component @xmath33 can be obtained by inter - exchanging the indices of @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the above four functions .",
    "these equations uncover the basic features for the integrability condition of the two - component nls equation , as in the single - component case . that is the balance between the competition between the kinetic energy and the harmonic external potential and the competition between the dispersion and nonlinearity . in the two - component case , for each component there is one pair for the kinetic energy and the harmonic external potential , which competes with the different pairs of the dispersion and the nonlinearity , namely , @xmath43 , a contribution from the intra - component ; @xmath44 , a contribution from the inter - component ; @xmath45 and @xmath46 , due to the existence of the component @xmath33 and relevant competitions between the dispersion and the nonlinearity in it . to clarify the above features , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show schematically this picture and make comparison with the cases in the single - component and the standard nls equations .",
    "this result indicates that the integrability condition in these equations can be viewed as a unified picture , irrespective of the standard or nonautonomous systems .",
    "the generalized integrability condition of eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) for the two - component nonautonomous nls equation has not been reported in the literature .",
    "it can be used to investigate unique phenomenons in many practical two - component nonlinear systems . to further explore it ,",
    "first we consider the symmetric case , such as @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . thus eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) reduces to @xmath51 which is the same as that in the single - component case . furthermore ,",
    "if @xmath52 and @xmath53 , eq . ( [ eq8 ] ) gives a constraint condition on the applied external potential @xmath54 this expression is completely consistent with those reported in the literature @xcite by using different methods . under this condition",
