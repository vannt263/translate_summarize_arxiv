    "in some uranium compounds with @xmath2 configuration ( @xmath3 ) the cef ground - state can be a nonmagnetic singlet .",
    "the cef singlet is also realized in some praseodymium compounds with @xmath4 configuration ( @xmath5 ) . in these cases",
    "the spin entropy of the system can go to zero as temperature decreases even though interactions with conduction electrons or with f electrons at other sites are absent .",
    "this is in striking contrast with the case of cerium compounds with @xmath6 configuration ( @xmath7 ) ; the entropy does not disappear at zero temperature if a ce ion is isolated because of the kramers degeneracy associated with the @xmath1 configuration . as a result the system chooses , depending on the interaction between ce sites , among a magnetically ordered state , a fermi liquid state , a superconducting state , and so on in which the entropy vanishes at zero temperature .    in these lattice fermion systems , which we call the @xmath0 lattice hereafter ,",
    "the itinerant state is also possible if the hybridization is large enough .",
    "thus both the localized f - electron picture and the band picture can be a starting point to understand the actual compounds with @xmath8 configuration .",
    "the most interesting situation occurs when the energy scale of the cef singlet state is comparable to that of the itinerant state .",
    "then both states compete for the stability .",
    "suppose we have the cef singlet as the ground state of the @xmath8 lattice , but its energy is only a little lower than the itinerant state .",
    "if the itinerant state is metallic , the entropy increases linearly as temperature increases .",
    "the temperature scale here is the kondo temperature , and is related to the large density of states at the fermi surface . on the other hand increase of the f - electron part of the entropy in the cef state follows the exponential law , and is much less significant in a low temperature range .",
    "thus there is a possibility for a phase transition to occur from the cef singlet state to the itinerant state as temperature increases in the @xmath0 lattice system .",
    "even if the itinerant state is a kondo insulator , the entropy can increase more rapidly than that in the cef state since the energy gap decreases with temperature . in the latter case the system changes from a metal to an insulator as temperature increases .",
    "this is opposite to the case of the mott transition where the low - temperature phase is an insulator .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the presence of a phase transition between the cef singlet and itinerant states in the @xmath0 lattice system at zero and finite temperatures . as the first step to explore an @xmath0 lattice system",
    ", we take the simplest possible approach and apply the mean field approximation with account of both itinerant and localized characters of f electrons .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the next section , we introduce the model and derive the mean - field equations .",
    "the same approximation scheme is applied to the two - impurity kondo system with @xmath9 configuration at each site in section 3 .",
    "it turns out helpful to compare the electronic states of both models .",
    "the relative stability of different phases in both the @xmath8 lattice system and the two - impurity kondo system is studied in section 4 .",
    "presence of the phase transition at finite temperatures is demonstrated .",
    "the final section is devoted to discussion of results with attention to possible experimental relevance .",
    "we introduce an @xmath0 lattice model as follows : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the site index , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are channels of conduction and f electrons , respectively .",
    "we express the cef singlet and triplet using a pseudo - spin operator of f electrons for each channel : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the vector composed of pauli matrices .",
    "the spin operator of conduction electrons is given by @xmath16 .",

    "is reproduced correctly in the mean - field approximation . here , @xmath20 is a half width of a conduction band and @xmath21 is the density of states per spin of conduction electrons at the fermi level .",
    "we note that the sum of the spin exchange and potential scattering terms is half of the permutation operator whose eigenvalue is 1 for the quasi - spin triplet and is @xmath22 for the singlet .",
    "the last term with @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamil ] ) represents the cef splitting .",
    "this splitting @xmath24 is also correctly given by the mean - field approximation due to the term @xmath25 .",
    "the restriction @xmath26 is imposed on eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamil ] ) to simulate the strong coulomb repulsion between f electrons .",
    "we take a mean field as @xmath27 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this mean field represents the fictitious hybridization between f and conduction electrons .",
    "we say `` fictitious hybridization '' in the sense that the real hybridization is absent in the model with fixed occupation of f states .",
    "however we neglect in this paper the phase fluctuation which makes the mean field vanish .",
    "the physical motivation for the neglect will be discussed in the final section .",
    "another mean - field is given by @xmath30 which expresses the mixing between two f orbitals on each site .",
    "this mixing gives rise to bonding - antibonding splitting of localized levels .",

    "we discuss this aspect of the mean - field theory again in the final section of the paper .    assuming equivalence of different sites and channels",

    "here we represent the magnitude of the hybridization between different channels of f electrons via conduction electrons by the parameter @xmath46 .",
    "let us take the bases in which the on - site hybridization between f and conduction electrons occurs only with the same channel .",
    "even for this case , the intersite hybridization between the channels 1 and 2 of f electrons can occur .",
    "this is because the point group symmetry around each site is not relevant to intersite interactions . from a detailed analysis",
    "we find that @xmath47 and @xmath46 can be chosen real .",
    "then we can assume @xmath48 in the following .",
    "we derive the mean - field equations by requiring the free energy to be stationary against variation of @xmath49 and @xmath47 . as a result",
    "three characteristic states appear : first the kondo state is the itinerant state where f - electrons hybridize with conduction electrons ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) .",
    "secondly the cef state is the localized state where f - electrons form the singlet of quasi - spins at each site ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) .",
    "thirdly the mixed state has a character interpolating between the kondo and cef states ( @xmath50 , @xmath53 ) . for the cef state we always have the solution @xmath54 and @xmath55 . here , @xmath56 is the fermi distribution function with energy @xmath57 .    in the following",
    "we consider the case where the number @xmath58 of conduction electrons is twice the number of lattice sites , and the conduction bands without hybridization have constant density of states @xmath59 between the band edges @xmath60 .",
    "then the system has the insulating ground state if f electrons form energy bands , since f and conduction electrons have the hybridization gap at the fermi level .",
    "this is called the kondo insulator .",
    "if f electrons are localized , on the other hand , the fermi level lies in the middle of the conduction band , and the system becomes metallic .",
    "for the kondo and mixed states , each conduction band is split into two pieces with a band gap between them .",
    "we use the notation @xmath61 , and @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "the band edges after splitting are given by @xmath66 then the mean - field equations are given by @xmath67 we solve eqs.([eq : mf1])-([eq : mf3 ] ) for various values of dimensionless parameters @xmath68 and @xmath46 at zero and finite temperatures .",
    "we note that the mixed state is metallic because the condition @xmath69 requires a finite density of states between bonding and antibonding f levels .",
    "in the course of understanding the electronic state in the @xmath8 lattice system , a necessary step is to clarify the difference from the @xmath8 impurity system .",
    "this impurity system is further related to the two - impurity kondo system with @xmath9 configuration at each site .",
    "namely , the @xmath8 impurity is considered as the short - distance limit of two kondo impurities .",
    "fortunately we have detailed knowledge about the two - impurity system by the mean - field theory @xcite , the quantum monte carlo @xcite , and the numerical renormalization group @xcite . in this paper",
    "we derive the ground state and the free energy in the same level of approximation as is used for the @xmath8 lattice system . then by comparing the electronic state of the @xmath8 lattice system and that of the impurity system",
    ", we obtain information about the influence of the lattice periodicity .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the two - impurity anderson model was solved by the mean - field theory .",
    "it was shown that the intersite hybridization gives smooth change from the limit of two independent kondo states ( kondo pair ) to the pair singlet state as the intersite interaction increases .",
    "physically we expect the same situation even though the occupation of f electrons at each site is very close to unity .",
    "the limiting case is described by the two - impurity kondo model .",
    "although the anderson lattice model is more general than the kondo lattice model , the cef state is harder to treat in the mean - field theory .",
    "since we have adopted the kondo lattice model with @xmath8 configurations , we need to solve the two - impurity kondo model for comparison .",
    "the two - impurity model is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 labels sites of f electrons .",
    "there is only a single conduction band since even in this case different screening channels are present around each impurity .",
    "we take the mean - fields in the form analogous to the @xmath0 lattice system : one is given by @xmath73 which represents the fictitious hybridization between f and conduction electrons at each site . the other",
    "is given by @xmath74 which expresses the mixing between two f electrons .",
    "as before the lagrange multiplier terms @xmath75 are added to eq . ( [ eq:2imph ] ) to enforce the constraints on the number of f electrons .",
    "there are two dimensionless parameters @xmath76 which represent the intersite hybridization effect via conduction electrons . namely we define @xmath77\\delta .",
    "\\label{eq : ab}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the magnitudes of @xmath78 and @xmath79 depend on both the distance @xmath80 between f sites and the band structure of conduction electrons , but they are always less than unity @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath78 causes asymmetry in the density of states of bonding and antibonding f states : in the case @xmath81 , with @xmath82 @xmath83 the density of states of the bonding states becomes wider ( narrower ) than that of the antibonding states . on the other hand the parameter @xmath79 controls the splitting between bonding and antibonding f states .",
    "the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ab ] ) is analogous to the term with @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi ] ) if one interchanges sites in the former with channels in the latter . in the two - impurity system",
    "there are three characteristic states : the first is the kondo - pair state where the kondo effect occurs independently at each site ( @xmath84 ) ; the second is the pair - singlet state where the pair - singlet of f electrons is formed without help of conduction electrons ( @xmath85 ) ; the third is the mixed state which interpolates the above two states ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "we have solved the mean - field equations numerically at zero temperature both for the @xmath8 lattice and the two - impurity systems .",
    "table [ table : para ] summarizes the parameters used in the calculation .",
    "figure [ fig : t0phase](a ) shows the ground - state energy per site in the @xmath0 lattice system at zero temperature .",
    "the origin of energy is taken to be that of the fermi sea without f electrons .",
    "the abscissa represents the bare cef splitting in units of @xmath87 .",
    "the notations @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 represent the ground - state energies of kondo , cef and mixed states , respectively .",
    "the effect of intersite hybridization @xmath46 depends only on its absolute value .",
    "thus results of @xmath90 with @xmath91 and @xmath92 are shown as representative cases in fig .",
    "[ fig : t0phase](a ) .",
    "we find that @xmath90 is larger than @xmath88 and @xmath89 for all combinations of parameters @xmath68 and @xmath46 .",
    "therefore the change from the kondo state to the cef state occurs discontinuously at the critical point @xmath93 .",
    "the mixed state which would have interpolated the kondo and cef states smoothly is not stabilized actually ; with increasing intersite hybridization , the mixed state with energy @xmath90 becomes larger in the mean - field theory .",
    "this is seen by the fact that @xmath90 with @xmath92 is larger than that with @xmath91 in fig .",
    "[ fig : t0phase](a ) .",
    "the reason is the following : if @xmath94 and @xmath81 , the density of states of the bonding f states has a larger width than that of the antibonding f states .",
    "the ground - state energy is given by the sum of single - particle energies of occupied states .",
    "namely , we integrate the total density of states multiplied by @xmath57 from @xmath95 to 0 .",
    "since the integral without @xmath57 is fixed by the number conservation , the total energy increases by the asymmetry induced by @xmath46 .",
    "similarly in the case of @xmath96 and @xmath81 , the asymmetry of the density of states in the opposite direction increases the energy again .",
    "for comparison , fig.[fig : t0phase](b ) shows the ground - state energy of f electrons in the two - impurity system at zero temperature .",
    "we have tried various values of @xmath78 and confirmed that @xmath78 does not influence the relative stability of the phases . on the contrary",
    "the value of @xmath79 drastically affects the ground state .",
    "hence , we fix @xmath97 and vary @xmath79 as a free parameter",
    ". we note that if @xmath98 , @xmath90 is larger than both @xmath88 and @xmath99 for any value of @xmath68 .",
    "this situation is analogous to that in the @xmath8 lattice system . as a result",
    "an abrupt change from the kondo - pair state to the pair - singlet state occurs as @xmath68 is increased . at the critical point of @xmath100 ,",
    "the two kinds of singlet states are degenerate .",
    "thus one observes the divergence of physical quantities such as the susceptibility and the specific heat coefficient .",
    "we have checked that this level - crossing behavior remains the same as long as @xmath101 . on the contrary , if the hybridization effect is large ( @xmath102 ) , the kondo - pair state connects continuously with the pair - singlet state through the mixed state . in this case",
    "no divergence occurs .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig : t0phase](b ) by the result that @xmath103 is lower than both @xmath88 and @xmath99 for any value of @xmath68 .",
    "these results obtained in the mean - field approximation agree with those in refs .",
    "@xcite for the two - impurity anderson model .",
    "we note that @xmath78 controls asymmetry of the density of states of f electrons with respect to the fermi level , just as @xmath46 does in the @xmath0 lattice system .",
    "we have confirmed that @xmath90 becomes larger as @xmath104 increases with @xmath79 being fixed .",
    "thus the parameter @xmath78 plays the same role as @xmath46 in the @xmath0 lattice system .",
    "however in the lattice system we do not have the parameter corresponding to @xmath79 in the impurity system .",
    "hence there is no stable mixed state in the @xmath0 lattice system in our calculation .",
    "mathematically the ineffectiveness @xmath46 in stabilizing the mixed state comes from the absence of @xmath105-summation in the self - energy of the @xmath0 lattice system .",
    "the mean - field equations are solved numerically also at finite temperatures , and the free energies are derived .",
    "figure [ fig : free](a ) shows temperature dependence of free energies per site for three different states in the @xmath0 lattice system : kondo , cef and mixed states .",
    "even though the cef singlet is the ground state , there is a case where the itinerant state is realized at higher temperatures .",
    "we find that the free energy of the mixed state is larger than those of the other two states for all values of parameters @xmath68 and @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , the transition between the kondo and cef phases occurs as a first - order one .",
    "figure [ fig : free](b ) shows free energies in the two - impurity system .",
    "the notations @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 represent the free energies of the kondo - pair , pair - singlet and mixed states , respectively .",
    "it is seen that with @xmath98 , @xmath108 is larger than @xmath106 and @xmath109 . as in the case of zero temperature ,",
    "the mixed state is not stabilized as long as @xmath110 for all values of @xmath68 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath108 with @xmath111 in fig .",
    "[ fig : free](b ) is lower than both @xmath106 and @xmath112 .",
    "we have checked that with @xmath113 the mixed state is stabilized at all temperatures .    from these results",
    "we infer that the parameter @xmath79 in the two - impurity system plays a decisive role also at finite temperatures .",
    "furthermore in the @xmath0 lattice system there is no temperature region where the mixed state is stabilized . in other words ,",
    "the hybridization effect which mediates between kondo and cef phases is ineffective , and the transition occurs discontinuously .",
    "in considering the relevance of the mean - field theory , we first take the case of impurity systems . the physical difference between the two - impurity kondo and anderson models",
    "is whether there is charge fluctuations of f electrons or not .",
    "reliable knowledge is available for both models from several numerical calculations .",
    "computation using the numerical renormalization group derived a level crossing between the kondo - pair state and the pair - singlet state @xcite . as a result divergence of the staggered susceptibility occurs at zero temperature . on the contrary , a quantum monte carlo calculation for the two - impurity anderson model @xcite found continuous behavior in physical quantities .",
    "this apparent conflict was resolved by sakai et al .",
    "@xcite who identified the origin of the continuous crossover as the bonding - antibonding splitting of f orbitals . in the kondo model ,",
    "the splitting is absent because there is no charge degrees of freedom for f electrons .",
    "thus the divergent behavior is purely a formal consequence of the model since there should always be some amount of charge fluctuations in real systems .    for our purpose of studying a new type of phase transition , we regard our model given by eq.([eq : hamil ] ) only as a simplified form of anderson - type models which are more difficult to analyze by the mean - field theory .",
    "then the finite order parameters for various phases are rather to be regarded as properties of a corresponding anderson - type model . in formally exact treatment of eq.([eq : hamil ] ) , all of our order parameters would vanish identically in contrast with the results of the mean - field theory .",
    "however by the same reason as explained above for the two - impurity models , we would rather accept the results of the mean - field theory as a physically possible consequence for more realistic models .",
    "it is instructive to take the limits @xmath114 and @xmath115 in eq.([eq : hamil ] ) .",
    "then the system becomes equivalent to two independent kondo lattices . in the half - filled case",
    "the ground state is either the kondo insulator or a magnetically ordered phase .",
    "the latter state is due to the rkky interaction which is not taken into account by the mean - field theory . we note that the ordered state can be either metallic or insulating depending on the magnetic structure .",
    "if it is ferromagnetic , the half - filled conduction band leads to the metallic state .",
    "as one increases @xmath116 from zero , the ground state should change from the magnetically ordered state to the insulating one .",
    "subsequently the nature of f electrons changes from the localized character to the itinerant one .",
    "since the entropy is different in the two phases , a phase transition can occur from one phase to the other as a function of temperature .",
    "let us compare this phase transition with another one which is known as an artifact of the mean - field theory .",
    "namely , as temperature increases in the mean - field theory , the order parameter @xmath117 of the kondo insulating phase decreases continuously to zero around the temperature @xmath118 . in the exact theory",
    "the local gauge fluctuation washes away the transition completely .",
    "we emphasize that the possible transition between the kondo insulator and the magnetically ordered phase should survive the fluctuation effect .",
    "now we consider the case of finite @xmath24 and @xmath46 . in the mean - field theory",
    ", the kondo insulating phase does not feel the effect of @xmath24 and @xmath46 .",
    "the resultant state is the same as the direct product of the two @xmath9 lattices .",
    "hence the second - order transition around @xmath119 is again fictitious .",
    "one can ask at zero temperature how the magnetic state changes as @xmath24 increases continuously from 0 . for small @xmath24 , we have the ordered induced moment which arises by mixing of the singlet and triplet levels . at certain critical value of @xmath24 , the cef singlet will become more stable than the induced moment .",
    "the situation is analogous to the spin chain problem where exchange interactions of alternating strength form dimers with an excitation gap .",
    "we note that the f electrons are always localized for any value of @xmath24 .",
    "thus the change to the kondo insulator can occur as a phase transition , although both states are spin singlets .      in actual @xmath0 lattice systems there should always be charge fluctuation as discussed above .",
    "then any exact eigenstate has some amount of hybridization between f and conduction electrons .",
    "however , there can still be two different kinds of hybridized states : the first one can be reached by perturbation theory with respect to hybridization .",
    "this state is connected with the localized @xmath0 state .",
    "the other state is the itinerant state which is not accessible by such perturbation theory .",
    "the latter state instead is simply described by the band picture of f electrons .",
    "thus possibility of the phase transition remains even though effects of charge fluctuations are included .",
    "we note that the transition to the cef singlet phase is of first order",
    ". a first - order transition should be less sensitive to fluctuation effects than a second - order one .",
    "we plan to check the robustness of the phase transition by using theories @xcite more reliable than the mean - field theory .      with respect to experimental relevance , we have to consider also the case where the number of conduction electrons deviates from @xmath120 . in the anderson lattice model with dominant @xmath8 configurations",
    ", the itinerant state then has a finite density of states of f electrons at the fermi level , and hence is metallic . in this case",
    "the fermi level is shifted from the center of the hybridization gap , and the average occupation of f electrons per site also deviates from 2 . thus in reality the transition from the itinerant state to the localized one is not always an insulator - metal transition .    concerning possible relevance of our theory , we mention two uranium compounds : unisn and @xmath121 . in the former case ,",
    "the insulating state at high temperatures changes via a first - order transition into a metallic state at @xmath122 k. in contrast to our model , however , the metallic state shows the antiferromagnetic order @xcite .",
    "as long as the localized picture applies to the low - temperature phase , the driving force of the transition may be similar to the one discussed in this paper .",
    "it is necessary to include the induced moment for more detailed analysis of unisn . in the latter case of @xmath121 , the cef singlet model accounts for gross features of highly anisotropic susceptibility and metamagnetic transition @xcite .",
    "the high - temperature phase is metallic showing the kondo effect in the resistivity .",
    "a clear anomaly in the specific heat is observed at temperature @xmath123 @xmath124 @xcite , and the resistivity shows the metallic behavior also below @xmath125 . by neutron scattering",
    "@xcite the antiferromagnetically ordered magnetic moments were observed below @xmath126 .",
    "the magnitude of the moment is only @xmath127 which is smaller by two orders of magnitude than the usual magnitude observed in similar compounds @xmath128 .",
    "moreover , the growth of moments with decreasing temperature does not follow the mean - field behavior .",
    "strangely , the nmr does not probe the internal field below @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "thus there is a possibility that the apparent antiferromagnetism is not a true long - range order , but due to very slow fluctuation of u moments .    in any case",
    "the specific heat jump at @xmath126 is too large to be accounted for by the tiny magnetic moment .",
    "thus , the proper order parameter in this ordered phase remains to be identified @xcite .",
    "we note that the inelastic neutron scattering @xcite probed a feature which looks like a cef excitation below @xmath126 .",
    "this fact may be a key to identify the order parameter .",
    "the phase transition seems to be of second order .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the phase transition from the itinerant state to the cef singlet state occurs as temperature decreases in the @xmath0 lattice system in the frame of the mean - field theory .",
    "properties of the @xmath0 lattice system were discussed in comparison with the two - impurity system at zero and finite temperatures .",
    "we suggest that the competition between localized and itinerant states of f electrons is the fundamental driving force for phase transitions in some uranium compounds such as unisn and @xmath129 . it remains to see to",
    "what extent the fluctuation effect beyond the mean - field theory affects the phase transition .",

    "<S> a new kind of phase transition is proposed for lattice fermion systems with simplified @xmath0 configurations at each site . </S>",
    "<S> the free energy of the model is computed in the mean - field approximation for both the itinerant state with the kondo screening , and a localized state with the crystalline electric field ( cef ) singlet at each site . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a first - order phase transition is demonstrated in which the itinerant state changes into the localized state toward lower temperatures . in the half - filled case , the insulating state at high temperatures changes into a metallic state , in marked contrast with the mott transition in the hubbard model . for comparison , </S>",
