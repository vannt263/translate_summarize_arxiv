    "dust is ubiquitous in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies but it constitutes only about 1% of the total mass of the ism . notwithstanding , dust plays an important role in galaxies : it is a tracer of star formation and stellar evolution , and contributes to the evolution of galaxies @xcite .",
    "interstellar dust grains span a wide range of sizes ( @xmath30.001 - 0.25  @xmath0 m ) and temperatures ( @xmath320 - 200  k ) .",
    "dust causes extinction of starlight : it dims and reddens the galaxy light at ultraviolet ( uv ) and optical wavelengths , but re - radiates about 90% of the absorbed galaxy energy into the infrared and submillimeter wavebands .",
    "interstellar dust can thus be observed in different galactic environments by mapping the re - radiated emission at mid - infrared , far - infrared and submillimeter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "contrary to the belief that early - type galaxies are  red and dead \" with little interstellar medium and star formation @xcite , recent studies have revealed that more than 30% of nearby early - type galaxies are rich in molecular clouds , gas and dust @xcite due to past merger events that contribute to interstellar and nuclear activities .",
    "ngc  1316 ( fornax  a , pks 0320 - 37 , arp  154 ) is a peculiar dusty early - type radio galaxy located in the outskirts of the fornax cluster ; roughly 2  mpc from the core of the cluster and at an adopted distance of 21.0  mpc @xcite .",
    "it is one of the two most luminous galaxies in the fornax cluster and the third most powerful nearby radio source besides centaurus  a and virgo  a. it has a pair of radio lobes lying outside the optical galaxy @xcite and a two - sided radio jet in the central 30@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the galaxy has a disturbed outer morphology with numerous loops , ripples , tidal tails and shells @xcite .",
    "spectroscopy of the brightest globular clusters suggests that a major merger took place about 3  gyr ago @xcite .",
    "other studies @xcite peg a merger event about 0.5  gyr ago . the abundance of molecular gas and the different kinematics of the stars and the gas @xcite support the idea of a recent merger with a companion gas - rich galaxy .",
    "ngc  1316 displays prominent dust patches in the central 2@xmath2.4 x 2@xmath2.4 , with an inner dust lane of about 2@xmath2 oriented along the apparent optical minor axis at a position angle of @xmath3  140@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "massive dust - heating stars are being formed in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the amount of dust estimated from optical extinction measurement is @xmath3 @xmath5 , that from _ iras _ total flux densities is @xmath6 and the estimate from the integrated flux densities at _ spitzer / mips _ is @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "co emission has been detected in two regions ( @xmath3 30@xmath1 southeast and @xmath345@xmath1 northwest ) of the nucleus , with corresponding molecular hydrogen masses of @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations in the energy range 0.3 - 8.0  kev have revealed a low - luminosity agn ( @xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "agn feedback may inhibit star formation @xcite .",
    "ngc  1316 is therefore a self - contained laboratory for studying galaxy formation and evolution , gas settling toward equilibrium after a merger activity , and feedback from agn on the star - forming ism .",
    "ngc  1316 was observed in june 2012 for 8  hours and 10  minutes with laboca @xcite , a bolometer camera operating on the apex 12  m submillimeter telescope @xcite at 5105  m elevation in the atacama desert in chile , one of the driest places on earth .",
    "laboca observes in the continuum at a central wavelength of 870  @xmath0 m ( 345  ghz ) in total - power scanning observing mode .",
    "the angular resolution is 19.@xmath15 and the field of view is 11.@xmath24 .",
    "its passband has a full width half maximum of about 60  ghz ( @xmath3150  @xmath0 m ) to match the corresponding atmospheric window .",
    "the version 2.12 - 2 of crush-2 @xcite was used to reduce the data and produced the full and detailed map of the dust . crush-2 a is comprehensive bolometric data reduction utility and imaging software package for ground - based telescopes .",
    "iteratively , crush-2 removed correlated noise from the raw data in the digitized time - streams , identified and flagged problematic data pixels and provided clean and independent bolometer signals in the individual ( @xmath370 ) scans , which were then co - added to produce the final maps .",
    "the flux measurement , signal - to - noise ratio and the root - mean - square analyses and estimations were all done with crush-2 .",
    "( wide - field infrared survey explorer : @xcite ) is a space infrared telescope that mapped the whole sky in four mid - infrared bands at central wavelengths of 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22  @xmath0 m labeled @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "the angular resolutions are 6.1 , 6.4 , 6.5 and 12@xmath1 respectively @xcite .",
    "the _ wise _ all - sky data products and atlas images are archived by the nasa ipac ( infrared processing and analysis center ) in the irsa ( infra - red science archive ) . however , reduced drizzled and cleaned _ wise _ images of ngc  1316 in the four bands were used for the study ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the ellipse task in the iraf ( image reduction and analysis facility ) isophote package was used to extract the flux information in the respective _ wise _ bands following the guidelines provided in the _ wise _ explanatory supplement @xcite .",
    "as one moves to longer wavelengths ( @xmath13 m ) , stars contribute less and less to the observed emission , and the ism dust component begins to dominate .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath14 bands ( 3.4 and 4.6 @xmath0 m ) are nearly extinction - free bands that are mostly sensitive to the evolved stellar population : the rayleigh - jeans part of the black - body emission of cool stars ( @xmath15  k ) .",
    "the emission in @xmath16 is dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) at 11.3  @xmath0 m and warm continuum dust emission from small grains .",
    "the @xmath12 band ( 22 @xmath0 m ) is more sensitive to the warm dust emission , which comes from photon - dominated regions ( or ultraviolet radiation fields ) in the ambient ism .",
    "laboca , at 870  @xmath0 m , is sensitive to cold dust that tends to dominate the bolometric luminosity in star - forming galaxies .",
    "the measured fluxes are given in table  [ measurements ] .",
    "the values measured in the four _ wise _ bands are comparable to those measured in the respective spitzer bands ( at 3.6 , 4.5 , 8 and 24  @xmath0 m ; see @xcite ) for our chosen elliptical apertures .",
    "the _ wise _ flux measurements were obtained by performing elliptical aperture photometry with the ellipse task in the iraf isophote package to get the total counts in each band ( in data number ( dn ) units ) after background subtractions , and applied the respective band corrections @xcite .",
    "the associated errors were estimated from the corresponding uncertainty maps @xcite .",
    "the measured flux in each _ wise _ band came from an ellipse centered on the image ( with position coordinates ( 03h  22 m  41.7s , @xmath1737@xmath4  12@xmath2  30@xmath1 ) ) .",
    "both the ellipticities and position angles were held constant during the elliptical isophotal fittings ( see table  [ table ] ) .",
    "the laboca flux was estimated in a circular aperture of about @xmath18 .",
    "we used the software galfit @xcite to identify the stellar component .",
    "we perform a two - dimensional fit of the superposition of a srsic model , a point - source and sky background to the @xmath11 image , following the same method as @xcite in their analysis of _ spitzer _ images .",
    "we then fixed all the parameters of the srsic model from the @xmath11 fit except the amplitude and center , and did a fit to the @xmath16 image ( see figure  [ image ] ) .",
    "the @xmath16 dust map of the galaxy , shown in figure  [ dustmaps ] , was obtained by subtracting the srsic model ( identified as the stellar contribution ) and the sky component .",
