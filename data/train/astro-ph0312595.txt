    "a disc galaxy is primarily a set of stars which rotate around the centre at near - circular orbits at the angular velocity @xmath1 .",
    "the observed spiral and bar - like structures are customarily treated as perturbations in such a differentially rotating disc .",
    "thus , one might expect that the typical pattern speeds of these structures , @xmath0 , should be of the order of some average star angular velocity , @xmath2 . in reality",
    ", however , the pattern speeds @xmath0 are of the order of the characteristic precession speed of star orbits , @xmath3 , which is only a small fraction of @xmath2 . recall that @xmath4 for near - circular orbits , where @xmath5 is the epicyclic frequency .    according to lynden - bell ( 1979 ) , if stars involved in the formation of the structures satisfy the inequality @xmath6 then each star orbit as a whole , but not the individual stars , participates in the perturbations .",
    "consequently , for studying such structures , it is more reasonable to use the model of the disc of star orbits precessing with different speeds than the commonly used concept of the differentially rotating disc of individual stars .",
    "the main conjecture of the present paper is that the galactic spirals and bars are the normal modes in such a model of the disc galaxy . in view of its simplicity , this approach , as we will see below , allows one to clarify the underlying physical mechanisms in the formation of galactic structures .",
    "the lynden - bell inequality ( [ in1 ] ) mentioned above are justified by results of numerous calculations ( e.g. , athanassoula & sellwood ( 1986 ) for bar - modes or lin , yuan & shu ( 1969 ) for spirals ) .     and",

    "fig.[fig_shust]b represents the ratios @xmath8 ( @xmath14 ) for these modes . for the first mode localized inside the circle @xmath15 ( thin dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_shust]b ) , typical ratios are of the order of 0.1 . for the second mode ( mean pattern speed ) , these ratios are typically of the order of 0.2 .",
    "even for the fastest mode ( @xmath16 ) , typically , @xmath17 , taking into account that this mode is more concentrated to the centre .",
    "therefore it is little wonder that the pattern speeds calculated below ( section 5 ) in the framework of our approach repeat very accurately those of athanassoula & sellwood ( 1986 ) in all cases , including the most rapid bar - modes .",
    ", for the model of the galaxy from lin , yuan , & shu ( 1969).,width=529 ]    on the other hand , it is evident from the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig_shust]b that the inequality ( [ in1 ] ) and hence our approach fail at sufficiently large radii .",
    "this is certainly of no importance for determining the pattern speeds , since the bar - modes are mainly localized near the centre . roughly speaking",
    ", the ratio @xmath8 becomes of the order of 1 near the corotation radius ( i.e. , at @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , for the first , second , and third modes , respectively ) .",
    "fig.[fig_shmidt]a , b show similar graphs for the classical spiral example from lin , yuan & shu ( 1969 ) where the model of our galaxy was considered .",
    "the pattern speed used here corresponds to the mean of the interval ( @xmath20 km s@xmath21 kpc@xmath21 ) suggested in the cited paper , i.e. , the horizontal line in fig.[fig_shmidt]a is @xmath22 km s@xmath21 kpc@xmath21 .",
    "fig.[fig_shmidt]b shows that the analysis of the eigen - modes of galactic disc for this model could be performed in the framework of our approach ( without the restrictions of the wkbj theory ) .",
    "note that substantially higher values of @xmath0 , compared to those from lin et al .",
    "( see , e.g. , blitz 1983 ) , are most likely due to an independent peripheral stage of the spiral structure .",
    "such structures can be analyzed using the integral equations described in the end of section 2 .",
    "we picture the disc as comprising a large number of slowly deforming and rotating elliptical rings , along which an individual stars moves so fast it is no more than a blur . small changes with radius in the shape or orientation of rings give rise to regions of enhanced surface density ( see , e.g. , fig 6 - 11 of binney & tremaine 1987 ) . in the absence of self gravity any initial pattern of over - densities",
    "will wind up because the part of the pattern at radius @xmath23 will pecess at a rate @xmath24 that varies significantly with @xmath23 .",
    "rings that have inclined minor axes exert gravitational torques on one another .",
    "these torques cause the angular momenta and radial actions of the rings slowly to change , thus deforming the rings and altering any initial pattern of surface density .",
    "the torques also affect the precession rates of the ring s the minor axes . the interaction between rings is strongest when the rings are physically adjacent , i.e. , have similar values of the actions . if we neglect the non - negligible range of the interaction , the disc has something in common with a goods train of deformable wagons connected by springs .",
    "self gravity allows waves of ring deformation to propagate through the disc just as the springs permit waves of wagon displacement and deformation to propagate down the train .",
    "we show that these waves can generate a pattern that rotates rigidly at an angular frequency that is larger than the fastest precession rate in the disc .",
    "the picture has points in common with lynden - bell s ( 1979 ) theory of bar formation in that it focuses on slowly precessing orbital rings , but it does not conclude , with lynden - bell , that the bar rotates at a rate that compromises between the fastest and slowest precession rates of the consituent rings . instead we find that both bars and spirals , in common with many wave phenomena , move faster than the underlying medium .",
    "several studies have shown that the rotation rates of bars in n - body models conform to our predictions rather than those of lynden - bell .",
    "the model of precessing orbits can be introduced directly as is done in section 2 after eq .",
    "( [ kern ] ) .",
    "however , this model is rigorously justified by the use of the regular procedure of the perturbation theory in the small lynden - bell parameter @xmath25 from ( 1 ) , with averaging over fast radial oscillations of stars .",
    "this programme is implemented in the beginning of section 2 .",
    "the resulting integral equations for disc normal modes derived in two ways , namely , ( i ) directly in the model of precessing orbits , and ( ii ) with the help of averaging , are identical .",
    "lynden - bell ( 1979 ) showed that the quantity @xmath26 ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the usual actions ) is an adiabatic invariant , provided that the inequality ( [ in1 ] ) is satisfied , i.e. , for sufficiently slow perturbations .",
    "this means that the orbits evolve by the action of the potential of low - frequency modes only through change in the angular momentum @xmath29 , with @xmath30 held constant .",
    "assume that in the initial moment @xmath31 the distribution function of orbits is @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 be a small variation of the orbit angular momentum owing to the action of a small potential perturbation for the time from @xmath31 to the current moment @xmath34 .",
    "the flow of the phase fluid is incompressible , so the phase element with the initial density @xmath35 should come into the point @xmath36 at the moment @xmath34 . accordingly , the euler differential of the distribution function , i.e. , its perturbation , is equal to @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "@xmath39 depends on the derivative @xmath40 .",
    "so it is not suprising that just this derivative is found to be critical to our theory of disc slow modes .",
    "henceforth , this derivative is referred to as the lynden - bell derivative of the distribution function . ] .",
    "it turns out that the behaviour of the lynden - bell derivative determines the type of eigen - modes ( bar - like or spiral ) .    to develop the above considerations , immediately resulting from the remarkable paper by lynden - bell ( 1979 ) , into the theory of low - frequency disc modes",
    ", one should invoke the dynamical equations and the expression for the 2d disc potential ( see sections 2,3 ) . as a result",
    ", we obtain the integral equations for these eigen - modes ( see eqs .",
    "( [ ie1 ] ) and ( [ ie2 ] ) below ) .",
    "if a potential satisfies these integral equations , the orbits evolve in such a way that the pattern rotates uniformly , with a certain angular speed @xmath0 .",
    "the physics of our bar - like and spiral solutions consists just in the fact that these are ( slow ) normal modes .",
    "all specificity ( compared to general modes ) is concerned with their slowness .",
    "the ensuing sections of this paper present the following material . in section 2 , we derive the basic integral equation of the theory ( by two methods ) .",
    "the basic integral equation is then reduced to the form of the classical eigen - value problem .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the analysis of the general properties of the basic integral equation .",
    "in particular , the crucial role of the lynden - bell derivative of the distribution function is revealed . in section 4 , this derivative is examined in more detail by the example of the schwarzschild model . in two following sections ,",
    "the specific solutions of the basic integral equation are given . to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed theory , test models studied earlier by the @xmath10-body method ( athanassoula & sellwood 1986 ) are adopted ( section 5 ) .",
    "the theory gives results in close agreement with results of the @xmath10-body simulations .",

    "the question now arises of whether there are some external reasons for growth of bar - modes .",
    "it is found that the growth can be due to the exchange by the angular momentum with the resonance stars at the corotation and the outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) .",

    "the self - gravity also extends the resonance spirals by @xmath213 ( polyachenko 2002b ) .",
    "therefore , the total angular length is about @xmath214 , which is typical for the majority of sb galaxies ( see , e.g. , sandage 1961 ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that above we consider only the linear stage of the formation of structures in sb galaxies .",
    "the observed galaxies can have strongly nonlinear bars .",
    "the length of such bars is apparently determined by 4:1 resonance .",
    "this is exactly the case , e.g. , for the nonlinear bar - modes computed by sellwood & athanassoula ( 1987 ) . for a symmetric bar which is free of odd fourier harmonics , in particular @xmath215 harmonic , the resonance 4:1 is the nearest to the centre , and thus is the most important one .",
    "let us say that @xmath191 becomes negative in some regions of the phase space .",
    "for the realistic distribution function ( see section 4 ) , these regions , if they exist , can occupy only a small fraction of the total volume of the phase space . then , in addition to the fast bars described above , the spiral - like solutions can occur .",
    "contrary to the bars , these new modes grow due to their intrinsic instability , which is inherent to the mode itself . as follows from ( [ imom2 ] ) , for an unstable mode ( @xmath216 ) , the angular momentum @xmath217 , i.e. the contributions to @xmath195 from the regions with opposite signs of the lynden - bell derivative @xmath191 cancel each other exactly : @xmath218 .",
    "obviously , the instability is due to the inner lindblad resonance , since the criterion of instability , @xmath219 , coincides exactly with the lynden - bell & kalnajs condition of wave exitation at ilr ( see ( [ er1 ] ) when @xmath220 ) .",
    "this resonance becomes the source of spiral waves in the case under consideration , contrary to the commonly accepted view of the role of ilr .",

    "the simplest case is that with one narrow domain of the negative derivative @xmath191 . using the latter equality of ( [ gamma2 ] ) and approximating the integrals as the products of the average values of the integrands and small volume of the phase space domain",
    ", we obtain : @xmath226 where @xmath33 is the width of the region with @xmath227 , and @xmath228 is calculated at the narrow region of the phase space of interest .",
    "this estimate is consistent with the explanation of the physical mechanism of the angular momentum exchange at the ilr given by lynden - bell & kalnajs ( 1972 ) .",
    "however , two more points need to be made : ( i ) the sign of the effect is opposite to that in the cited paper , in accordance with the fact that @xmath227 , and ( ii ) strictly speaking , their explanation is appropriate only for the case of near - circular star orbits , although , as we demonstrate below , the very elongated orbits play an essential role .",
    "nevertheless , their considerations can readily be generalized to such a case .",
    "let us consider the generalized schwarzschild distribution function ( shu 1970 ) @xmath229 where @xmath230 is the star energy , @xmath231 is the radius of the guiding centre : @xmath232 , @xmath233 is the star energy at the circular orbit , @xmath234 is the circular velocity , @xmath235 is the equilibrium potential .",
    "the specific model is given by the functions @xmath236 and @xmath237 ; in the epicyclic limit , when @xmath238 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 , where @xmath241 and @xmath242 are the surface density and radial velocity dispersion respectively",

    "it is provided by the term @xmath245 in ( [ lbd1 ] ) .",
    "for example , in the case of the flat rotation curve ( @xmath246 ) , this term equals @xmath247 . since @xmath238 almost everywhere in disc galaxies ,",
    "this term is dominant .",
    "however , there may exist some narrow regions , in which such predominance is broken .",
    "firstly , this is possible in the regions where the function @xmath248 is sufficiently small .",

    "note the obvious causes of such peculiarities in the rotation curves : ( i ) a changeover from the potential of the spherical component to the potential of the disc , and ( ii ) a sharp edge of one of the disc components .",
    "secondly , the function @xmath237 increases rapidly when approaching the galactic centre , so that the rotation velocity @xmath251 in the central parts becomes of the order of @xmath252 .",
    "relatively small deviations in the behaviour of the rotation curve may lead to very different solutions of the basic equation .",
    "some other factors are also very important .",
    "the excess of the pattern speed above the maximum precession rate is due to self - gravity .",
    "thus the solutions have the bar - like form only in sufficiently massive discs , while for discs with relatively small masses we can obtain only spiral modes .",
    "the number of very elongated orbits plays the essential role .",
    "for example , the excess of such orbits over the number prescribed by the generalized schwarzschild distribution function ( [ schw ] ) strongly increases the growth rate of the spiral modes due to increase of @xmath253 for these orbits . besides",
    ", it is seen from ( [ lbd1 ] ) that @xmath254 ( @xmath227 ) increases with @xmath255 .",

    "the unknown function @xmath256 as well as the kernel @xmath257 are considered on the @xmath258 grid in the phase space @xmath259 .",
    "then the obtained matrix equation can be solved using standard methods of linear algebra .",
    "it is advisable to put aside the distribution function ( [ schw ] ) until the next section and demonstrate the capabilities of the theory by applying it to test models .",
    "for such a role , we choose two models investigated by the @xmath10-body simulations of athanassoula & sellwood ( 1986 ) .",
    "the equilibrium potential for all the models is the plummer potential , @xmath9 .",
    "first of all , we are dealing with a kalnajs ( 1976 ) model , which athanassoula & sellwood ( 1986 ) have denoted by ( @xmath260 , @xmath261 , @xmath262 , @xmath263 ) ( see their table 1 ) .",
    "the computed spectrum of the matrix equation , which consists of @xmath264 eigen - values , is shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",

    "they are located in the interval between the minimum and maximum values of the precession speed : @xmath265 .",
    "these modes are the stable solutions of the form @xmath266 .",
    "the peculiar van kampen modes are of no interest in studying the bar modes .",
    "thus , in the @xmath10-body simulations of athanassoula & sellwood , the bar is always one of the modes of discrete spectra .",

    "the figure shows that the pattern speeds of the first and second modes ( counting from the right ) coincide with the pattern speeds obtained in the @xmath10-body simulations to within 6% .",
    "it is found ( see below ) that the growth rates of the other 3 modes are much lower , so they could not be observed in the numerical experiments .",
    "rough estimates of growth rates for the most rapid modes , in which we assumed that the star orbits are circular , give @xmath267 , @xmath268 .",

    "note that in this case , the olr terms are dominating .",
    "the mode with the maximum pattern speed has the highest growth rate . obviously , the reason is that such a mode possesses the smallest corotation radius , where the disc surface density is high .",
    "the estimate for the growth rate of the most rapid mode is nearly twise as much as one obtained by athanassoula & sellwood ( 1986 ) in the @xmath10-body simulations . for the second mode ,",
    "the `` experimental '' and `` theoretical '' growth rates are quite close . among the reasons of the possible discrepancy",
    ", one can mention the use of the circular orbit approximation .",
    "recall that the estimates obtained by athanassoula & sellwood ( 1986 ) within the swing amplification approach are twice as little than their `` experimantal '' values .",

    "it is clear that bars can form in galaxies with sufficiently massive discs . in this case , the necessary inequality @xmath279 can be fulfilled , otherwise the inner lindblad resonances occur .",

    "note that the fulfillment of the inequality @xmath279 is made difficult not only for low - mass discs but also for discs with a high concentration of mass at the centre .",

    ". they can be either trailing or leading spirals , the latter are the majority .",
    "narrowly - localized van kampen solutions of the continuous spectrum , which occupy the wide band of real frequencies , @xmath300 , can be both the trailing and leading spirals since for each of these modes , effectively , the gravitational constant @xmath301 everywhere in the galactic disc with the assumed parameters . ] . when employing the concept of eigen - modes , just the packets of leading van kampen waves participate in the classical swing amplification process described in the original papers by goldreich & lynden - bell ( 1965 ) , julian & toomre ( 1966 ) , and toomre ( 1981 ) . if the dispersion of orbit speeds , @xmath302 , is sufficiently small ( that is always assumed ) , we obtain quasi - monochromatic packets of van kampen waves . just such wave packets moving with some group velocity from the central regions and approaching the corotation , can be amplified by the resonance effects under the transformation from the leading form to trailing one .",
    "though each of the van kampen modes is essentially kinematic ( @xmath303 ) , the finite packets of these waves are governed by their self - gravity .",
    "in particular , the local dispersion relation of lin  shu ",
    "kalnajs should be valid for them ( away from the resonances ) .",
    "here we touch on those improvements , which the present theory can introduce into the original scheme of the swing amplifier .",
    "they are connected with the possibility of unstable discrete leading spiral modes . in particular",
    ", there is then no need to reflect the short trailing waves somewhere in the central regions to close the feedback loop .",
    "given that the discrete leading modes are monochromatic , the efficiency of the resonance amplification should grow in comparison with quasi - monochromatic packets of the van kampen waves .",
    "these modes might be the  embryo \" waves for their subsequent resonance growth due to the swing amplifier .",
    "then , apparently , from the full set of these waves , the mode with the maximum potential perturbation at the corotation is selected .",
    "let us emphasize again the  inversed \" role of the ilr ( compared to the commonly accepted one ) , which acts as the generator of spiral waves .",
    "the growth rates of spiral modes for the standard model are rather low : they provide the growth of the amplitude @xmath304 times , typically for @xmath305 years ( taking into account that @xmath306 corresponds to the rotation period @xmath307 years ) .",
    "the main reason for such low values of growth rates follows from fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "this figure shows that the curve @xmath308 ( for a typical unstable spiral mode ) intersects the strip of negative values of the lynden - bell derivative , @xmath191 , deep inside the phase space of the system under consideration , at @xmath259 corresponding to highly elongated orbits .",
    "but the number of such orbits in the schwarzschild distribution function ( decreasing exponentially with the ratio @xmath309 ) is small .",
    "the growth rates of the spiral modes can be significantly increased if one takes into account that the number of such orbits is actually very much larger .",
    "indeed , we are dealing with the central regions of spiral galaxies , where the contribution of the spherical component , i.e. stars of population ii that have the radially elongated velocity diagram , is essential .",
    "it implies that the spherical component can play an important active role , instead of the passive role of a rigid halo as is commonly accepted .",
    "computation with the standard model that is accordingly modified , leads to tenfold growth rates .",
    "the modification consists in the substitution @xmath310 provided that @xmath311 .",
    "for such a modification , the observed surface density and radial velocity dispersion are almost unchanged .",
    "it is also important that this modification leads to the predominance of trailing spiral modes .",
    "the observed galactic spirals are most likely just these modes ( or similar spirals in other modifications of the standard model ) .",
    "for instance , the modes are most often the trailing half - turn spirals as in the majority of observed galaxies .",
    "in particular , an interesting modification consists of forming the  peak \" on the curve @xmath24 at sufficiently large @xmath23 , where the lynden - bell derivative can be either positive or negative ( in fig.[fig3 ] , the upper right corner of the @xmath259 phase plane ) .",
    "we omit descriptions of the variety of cases , restricting ourselves to the only picture of the typical spiral mode ( fig.[fig4 ] ) .        in conclusion",
    "let us touch on one very important aspect of the problem .",
    "fig.[fig2]c shows that the `` generalized '' lynden - bell derivative @xmath293 at @xmath312 can be made negative more easily compared to the case @xmath313 .",
    "this effect is due to the inverse dependence of the large positive term @xmath314 in the expression ( [ lbd1 ] ) on @xmath182 .",
    "hence , in the outer parts of galaxies ( for our galaxy , just beyond the solar circle ) the additional multi - arm structures are generated , which are independent from the central spiral structure ( the latter usually has two arms ) in fig.[fig2]c are shown only at sufficiently large radii to emphasize that modes with @xmath312 can not typically occupy as wide a region as the two - arm mode does .",
    "this is explained by the different behaviour of @xmath7 and @xmath315 for @xmath312 . ] .",
    "furthermore , one can expect that several modes will be generated there simultaneously leading to formation of the so - called flocculent structures ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1982 , 1987 ) .",
    "all the aforementioned agrees with observations of galaxies ( see , for example , the hubble atlas of galaxies , sandage ( 1961 ) ) . as a rule , in the central part of the disc , the regular two - arm spiral",
    "is seen , which is then superseded by a multi - arm or disordered structure .",
    "it is appropriate to mention here that elmegreen ( 1992 ) has clearly demonstrated that three - arm spiral structures appear only on the periphery of galaxies beyond the inner lindblad resonance for the @xmath215 mode .",
    "the new approach to the study of structures in spiral galaxies suggested above is based on a view of a galactic disc as a set of precessing orbits . following this model ,",
    "we have obtained the simple integral equation that is a very convenient tool for studying galactic structure .",
    "non - axisymmetric structures are considered as the normal modes of the basic integral equation ( [ ie2 ] ) .",
    "it is found that the properties of solutions depend crucially on the behaviour of the lynden - bell derivative , @xmath191 , at the phase space of the disc .",
    "the solutions have bar - like or spiral form depending on whether @xmath191 is positive everywhere or negative somewhere in the phase space .    within the framework of the suggested approach , which does not include the swing amplifier , we succeeded in calculating the pattern speeds and growth rates of all the modes obtained earlier in the @xmath10-body simulations by athanassoula & sellwood ( 1986 ) , the coincidence of results being very high .",
    "thus , it is shown that the bar - mode grows due to the immediate action of its gravity on the stars in the vicinity of corotation leading to the angular momentum exchange between these stars and the bar - mode .",
    "note that athanassoula & sellwood ( 1986 ) could readily calculate exact growth rates of all the modes they computed by the formulas ( [ gr1 ] , [ er1 ] ) .",
    "however , they preferred the language of swing amplification for rough estimates of the growth rates .    to avoid confusion , we should emphasize that here we deal only with the standard fast bars .",
    "as for the slow bars of lynden - bell ( 1979 ) , they are most likely the central parts of the unstable spiral modes ( in this sense , they are secondary ) .",
    "note that here we leave aside the possibility of the slow bar formation in very hot centres of galactic discs ( in full analogy to the ellipsoidal deformation of spherical systems under the action of the radial orbit instability ) .",
    "in contrast , the fast bars are primary while the adjacent spirals are secondary since the spirals form as the response of the disc near the corotation to the bar gravity .",
    "the commonly used approach to the problem of formation of the normal spiral structures consists in using either the swing amplification mechanism ( toomre 1981 ) or its weaker counterpart ( overreflection with reference to the waser mechanism ",
    "see , e.g. , bertin & lin 1996 ) . note that the swing amplification mechanism is sometimes the only way for growth of the initial perturbations .",
    "it seems likely that such galaxies do not have any organized spiral structure of the mode nature .",
    "certainly , this mechanism can effectively amplify transient wave perturbations .    in traditional mechanisms , the region of corotation plays the central role . in our approach , we draw attention to ilrs that can under certain conditions cause the excitation of a great variety of spiral modes . unlike the usual epicyclic idea of ilr as a certain circle , ilr in our unstable modes extends over wide regions of the galactic disc .",
    "this is due to participation of a variety of orbits including highly elongated orbits ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) . on the one hand",
    ", ilr can give rise to leading spiral modes , which in turn can be the  embryos \" for further work of the swing amplifier .",
    "on the other hand , ilr can provide a variety of trailing spirals including those in the region between two ilrs ( see fig.[fig2]b ) .",
    "with thanks to v.l .",
    "polyachenko for useful discussions .",
    "the perturbed distribution function @xmath316 is represented as a fourier series that contains resonance denominators : @xmath317 it is natural to name the terms with @xmath318 , @xmath220 , and @xmath319 as `` ilr '' , `` cr '' , and `` olr '' terms , respectively . in section 2 , we have restricted ourselves to the only ilr term . as it was shown in section 4 , this leads to the correct results ( with an accuracy of 10% ) in determination of the pattern speeds .",
    "thus , one can conclude that the ilr - term has a dominant role .",
    "the ratio of the denominator of the ilr term to the denominator of the cr term ( closest to ilr ) is @xmath320 where the quantity @xmath321 was already used in the introduction . strictly speaking",

    ". they can be adequate even beyond the framework of rigorous validity of our approximate theory .",
    "for the other two modes from fig.[fig1s ] , the ratio is considerably smaller than 1 only in the central regions .",
    "nevertheless , we can hope that the approach is still valid even for these modes , at least quantitatively , taking into account that the perturbation amplitude decrease with radius , being relatively small at the corotation .",
    "besides , there is one more factor that weakens the role of cr term ; it is considered in the next point .",
    "the coefficient @xmath325 in the expansion ( [ dfe1 ] ) is proportional to the linear combination of the derivatives of the unperturbed distribution function @xmath326 ( see below , item 5 ) : @xmath327 where @xmath328 thus , for the bi - symmetric mode @xmath102 one should actually calculate the ratio @xmath329 rather than ( [ ratio ] ) . in the epicyclic approximation , which is valid everywhere beyond the very central parts of galactic discs : @xmath330",
    "fortunately , for the cr term @xmath331 , so the ratio ( [ ratio2 ] ) contains the additional small factor ( compared to ( [ ratio ] ) ) .",

    "the particular number of harmonics , needed for the mode computation , is determined `` experimentally '' .",

    "then , the influence of a particular resonance can be `` measured '' separately by omitting an unnecessary term .",
    "in such a way , we study the influence of cr term , switching off the olr term ( run 2 ) .",
    "after that we study the impact of the olr term , omitting cr term ( run 3 ) . in all these three cases , when the principal ilr term is present , the pictures of the unstable modes in the complex @xmath370-plane resemble each other .",
    "the situation has changed when we dropped the ilr term . in the result we obtained unrealistic picture of a sea of unstable modes with growth rates less than @xmath371 .",
    "this fact certainly confirms the dominating role of the ilr term .          *",
    "all pattern speeds gained small positive biases , compared to the pattern speeds obtained from the basic integral equation ( [ ie2 ] ) .",
    "* when all three terms are taken into account , both the pattern speed and the growth rate of the most unstable mode ( mode 1 ) is determined with very good accuracy .",
    "separate consideration of cr and olr ( runs 2 and 3 ) shows that the contribution of olr term into the growth rate exceeds one of cr .",
    "* from comparing the eigen - frequency of mode 2 obtained in runs 1 and 3 , it follows that mode s growth is entirely due to the interaction of the gravitational potential of the mode with the resonance stars at olr .    in principle , equations ( [ bs2 ] ) allow to consider any number of terms , although it can be checked that the terms with @xmath332 are of less importance .",
    "for example , taking account of terms @xmath372 will not lead to any new unstable modes .",
    "the fastest modes become rather more unstable : @xmath373 , @xmath374 ."
