    "there is a first - order phase transition between in - plane and c - axis order at @xmath170 , where @xmath123 is the lattice coordination number .",
    "this transition continues to finite @xmath100 and terminates at at bicritical point.@xcite to efficiently sample all spin configurations close to this first - order phase transition , we employ the parallel - tempering algorithm.@xcite the thermal transition at the bicritical point is in the 3d heisenberg universality class , i.e. , the o(3 ) symmetry is restored here .",
    "we notice that when crossing the first - order line upon heating up the system , we always favor the state which is the ground state for @xmath171 , which has a higher entropy because both spin angles are unlocked .",
    "we now turn to the behavior of the anisotropic magnetic susceptibilities , fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] . motivated by the experimental results to yb(rh@xmath2co@xmath3)@xmath0si@xmath0 , we only consider magnetic order along the c axis . for all results in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] , we consider @xmath172 and the effects of the single ion anisotropy are encoded by the parameter @xmath168 . in figs .",
    "[ fig : chi]a - c we see that as we approach the bicritical point , the fluctuations in @xmath64 are enhanced .",
    "interestingly , in [ fig : chi]a - b , we even have @xmath173 at intermediary temperatures above @xmath18 , with the two curves crossing only very close to the transition .",
    "this difference between @xmath64 and @xmath101 is further enhanced if we increase the single - ion anisotropy @xmath168 , figs .",
    "[ fig : chi]d and [ fig : chi]e ( in both of them we keep the ratio @xmath174 the same as in fig .  [ fig : chi]a so we do not move too far away from the bicritical point ) .",
    "finally in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi]f we consider both @xmath168 and @xmath97 negative and we always have @xmath175 for @xmath124 .    therefore , we see that model naturally describes the crossing of the susceptibilities above @xmath18 as a result of the proximity to a bicritical point . while it is true that the splitting between @xmath64 and @xmath101 above the crossing point is small , it is still remarkable that a purely local moment description is able to capture such crossover , an observation which motivates us to associate this crossing to the proximity of a bicritical point .",
