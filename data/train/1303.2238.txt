    "the iter device is a tokamak designed to study controlled thermonuclear fusion . roughly speaking ,",
    "it is a toroidal vessel containing a magnetised plasma where fusion reactions occur .",
    "the plasma is kept out of the vessel walls by a magnetic field which lines have a specific helicoidal geometry",
    ". however , turbulence develops in the plasma and leads to thermal transport which decreases the confinement efficiency and thus needs a careful study .",
    "plasma is constituted of ions and electrons , which motion is induced by the magnetic field .",
    "the characteristic mean free path is high , even compared with the vessel size , therefore a kinetic description of particles is required , see _ dimits _ @xcite .",
    "then the full 6d vlasov - poisson model should be used for both ions and electrons to properly describe the plasma evolution . however , the plasma flow in presence of a strong magnetic field has characteristics that allow some physical assumptions to reduce the model .",
    "first , the larmor radius , i.e. the radius of the cyclotronic motion of particles around magnetic field lines , can be considered as small compared with the tokamak size and the gyration frequency very fast compared to the plasma frequency .",
    "thus this motion can be averaged ( gyro - average ) becoming the so - called guiding center motion . as a consequence",
    ", 6d vlasov - poisson model is reduced to a 5d gyrokinetic model by averaging equations in such a way the 6d toroidal coordinate system @xmath0 becomes a 5d coordinate system @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the parallel and @xmath3 the perpendicular to the field lines components of the particles velocity , @xmath4 the angular velocity around the field lines and @xmath5 the magnetic momentum depending on the velocity norm @xmath6 , on the magnetic field magnitude @xmath7 and on the particles mass @xmath8 which is an adiabatic invariant . moreover ,",
    "the magnetic field is assumed to be steady and the mass of electrons @xmath9 is very small compared to the mass of ions @xmath10 .",
    "thus the cyclotron frequency @xmath11 is much faster for electrons than for ions @xmath12 .",
    "therefore the electrons are assumed to be at equilibrium , i.e. the effect of the electrons cyclotronic motion is neglected and their distribution is then supposed to be constant in time .",
    "the 5d gyrokinetic model then reduces to a vlasov like equation for ions guiding center motion : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the ion distribution function for a given adiabatic invariant @xmath15 with @xmath16 , velocities @xmath17 and @xmath18 define the guiding center trajectories .",
    "if @xmath19 , then the model is termed as conservative and is equivalent to a vlasov equation in its advective form : @xmath20 this equation for ions is coupled with a quasi - neutrality equation for the electric potential @xmath21 on real particles position , with @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 the larmor radius ) : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an equilibrium electronic density , @xmath26 the electronic temperature , @xmath27 the electronic charge , @xmath28 the boltzmann constant for electrons and @xmath29 the cyclotronic frequency for ions .",
    "+ these equations are of a simple form , but they have to be solved very efficiently because of the 5d space and the large characteristic time scales considered .",
    "this work is then a contribution in this direction , following _ grandgirard et al _ who develops the gysela 5d code that solves this @xmath30 gyrokinetic model , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "looking at the model , one notices that the adiabatic invariant @xmath15 acts as a parameter .",
    "therefore for each @xmath15 we have to solve a 4d advection equation as accurately as possible but also taking special care on mass and energy conservation , especially in this context of large characteristic time scales . the maximum principle that exists at the continuous level for the vlasov equation",
    "should also be carefully studied at discrete level : @xmath31 with @xmath32 the value at @xmath33 in cell @xmath34 at time @xmath35 .",
    "there is no physical dissipation process in the gyrokinetic model that might dissipate over / undershoots created by the scheme and the loss of this bounding extrema of the solution at @xmath36 may even eventually crash a simulation .",
    "those studies will be achieved in this paper on a relevant reduced model , the 4d drift - kinetic model described in section [ use ] , which has the same structure than equations .",
    "the geometrical assumptions of this model for ion plasma turbulence are a cylindrical geometry with coordinates @xmath37 and a constant magnetic field @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the unit vector in @xmath40 direction .",
    "this 4d model is conservative and will be discretized using a conservative semi - lagrangian scheme , the parabolic spline method scheme ( psm , see _ zerroukat et al _ @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it is a fourth order scheme which is equivalent for linear advections to the backward semi - lagrangian scheme ( bsl ) currently used in the gysela code ( see _ grandgirard et al _ @xcite ) and introduced by _ cheng - knorr _ @xcite and _ sonnendrcker et al _ @xcite ) .",
    "this conservative psm scheme based on the conservative form of the vlasov equation will be described in section [ use ] and properly allows a directional splitting .",
    "+ in this paper , the bsl and psm schemes will be detailed with an emphasis on their similarities and differences .",
    "we will see that one difference is about the maximum principle .",
    "the bsl scheme satisfies it only with a condition on the distribution function reconstruction and the conservative psm scheme does not satisfy it without an extra condition on the volumes conservation in the phase space .",
    "the last condition is equivalent to try to impose that the velocity field is divergence free at the discrete level .",
    "a scheme is given to satisfy this constraint in the form of an equivalent finite volume scheme .",
    "moreover , we have designed a slope limiting procedure , slope limited splines ( sls ) , to get closer to a maximum principle for the discrete solution , by at least diminish the spurious oscillations appearing when strong gradients exist in the distribution function profile .",
    "+ the outline of this paper is the following : in section [ section_bslvspsm ] will be recalled some important properties of vlasov equations at the continuous level .",
    "then bsl and psm schemes will be described and compared , according to properties of the discrete solutions . in section [ stability ] , a numerical method will be given to improve the respect of the maximum principle by vlasov discrete solutions when using the psm scheme and particularly to keep constant the volume in the phase space .",
    "in section [ use ] , practical aspects of the psm scheme use will be described in the context of the 4d drift - kinetic model and at last we will comment on numerical results .",

    "that means that the scheme turns to order 1 when an extrema exists , i.e. the slope ratio @xmath134 .",
