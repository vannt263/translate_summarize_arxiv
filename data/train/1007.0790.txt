    "the nature of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) vacuum is one of the most intriguing aspects of modern physics . besides , it is very hard to get a full understanding of its properties , because its most important characteristics , namely chiral symmetry breaking and color confinement , have a non - perturbative origin , and the use of perturbative methods is useless .",
    "one of the best strategies to overcome this problem is offered by lattice qcd simulations at zero chemical potential ( see  @xcite for several examples and see also references therein ) . at vanishing quark chemical potential",
    ", it is almost established that two crossovers take place at nearly the same temperature ; one for quark deconfinement , and another one for the ( approximate ) restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "it is still under debate whether two crossovers should occur at exactly the same temperature , see for example the report in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to the physics of strong interactions , which is capable to capture some of the non - perturbative properties of the qcd vacuum , at the same time being easy to manage mathematically , is the nambu - jona lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite , see also refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews . in this model ,",
    "the qcd gluon - mediated interactions are replaced by effective interactions among quarks , which are built in order to respect the global symmetries of qcd . since dynamical gluons",
    "are absent in this model , it is not a gauge theory .",
    "however , it shares the global symmetries of the qcd action ; moreover , the parameters of the njl model are fixed to reproduce some phenomenological quantity of the qcd vacuum : in its simplest version , the pion decay constant , the vacuum pion mass and the vacuum chiral condensate are reproduced .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable that the main characteristics of its phase diagram represent , at least qualitatively , those of qcd .    critically speaking",
    ", the worst aspect of the njl model is that it lacks confinement : massive quark poles of the quark propagator are present at any temperature and/or chemical potential . it is well known that color confinement can be described in terms of the center symmetry of the color gauge group and of the polyakov loop  @xcite , which is an order parameter for the center symmetry .",
    "motivated by this property , the polyakov extended nambu - jona lasinio model ( p - njl model ) has been introduced  @xcite , in which the concept of statistical confinement replaces that of the true confinement of qcd , and an effective interaction among the chiral condensate and the polyakov loop is achieved by a covariant coupling of quarks with a background temporal gluon field . in the literature , there are several studies about various aspects of the p - njl model .",
    "its phase structure with two flavors and symmetric quark matter has been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite ; pnjl model with a van der monde term has been considered in  @xcite ; phase structure with 2 + 1 flavors has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite ; possible realization of the quarkyonic phase  @xcite has been discussed in  @xcite ; mass dependence of the phase diagram , and a possible emergence of the quarkyonic phase , is investigated in  @xcite ; phase diagram with imaginary chemical potential has been studied in  @xcite ; dual quark condensate has been computed in  @xcite ; neutral phases have been investigated in  @xcite ; phase diagram with asymmetric quark matter have been studied in  @xcite ; non - local extension has been introduced in  @xcite ; role of eight - quark interactions in the pnjl context has been elucidated in  @xcite .",
    "the modification of the qcd vacuum , and of its thermal excitations as well , under the influence of external fields , is an attractive topic .",
    "firstly , it is extremely interesting to understand how an external field can modify the main characteristics of confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "lattice studies on the response to external magnetic fields can be found in  @xcite .",
    "qcd in chromo - magnetic fields has been investigated on the lattice in  @xcite .",
    "previous studies of qcd in magnetic fields , and of qcd - like theories as well , can be found in refs .",
    ". a self - consistent model calculations of magnetic catalysis and of deconfinement pseudo - critical temperature in magnetic field , has been performed firstly in  @xcite within the pnjl model , and then in  @xcite using the polyakov extended quark - meson model .",
    "effective models in chromo - magnetic fields have been considered in  @xcite .",
    "besides , strong magnetic fields might be produced in non - central heavy ion collisions  @xcite . in this case , it has been argued that the non - trivial topological structure of thermal qcd gives rise to chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) @xcite .    beside the polyakov loop ,",
    "it has been suggested  @xcite that another observable which is an order parameter for the center symmetry , hence for confinement , is the dressed polyakov loop . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", the dressed polyakov loop is built from the canonical ( called _ thin _ ) polyakov loop , by dressing it with higher order loops , which wind once around the compact temporal direction . in this context , the order of a loop is given by its length ; the thin polyakov loop corresponds to the shortest one .",
    "the dressing becomes more important when quark masses are finite ( polyakov loop is an exact order parameter for confinement - deconfinement only in the ideal case of static quarks with infinite masses ) . in refs .",
    "@xcite the dressed polyakov loop has been computed within the scheme of truncated schwinger - dyson equations , with a model for resummed quark - gluon vertex and in - medium gluon propagator computed on the lattice . within the nambu - jona lasinio model , in which the qcd interaction among quarks is replaced by a contact four - fermion interaction ,",
    "@xmath2 has been computed at finite temperature and chemical potential in  @xcite .",
    "finally , the dressed polyakov loop has been computed within the pnjl model in  @xcite at finite temperature .    in this article , we compute the phase structure and the dressed polyakov loop of hot quark matter at zero chemical potential , in an external magnetic field . to compute the effective potential ,",
    "we rely on the pnjl model of strongly interacting quarks .",
    "we will limit ourselves to the one - loop approximation ( saddle point ) , which is enough to draw a phase structure .",
    "the novelty of the present article is manyfold .",
    "firstly , we introduce the eight - quark interaction  @xcite in the pnjl model in an external magnetic field ( previous studies of the pnjl model in magnetic and chromomagnetic fields neglected this kind of interaction ) . within the nambu - jona lasinio model",
    ", it has been shown that the eight - quark interactions naturally lowers the pseudo - critical temperature for ( approximate ) chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "magnetic catalysis in the njl model with multi - quark interactions has been investigated in  @xcite . however , in those studies , the computation of quantities relevant for deconfinement crossover is lacking .",
    "on the other hand , in  @xcite the polyakov extended njl model with multi - quark interaction has been investigated , but without magnetic field .",
    "it is of interest , then , to study the response of quark matter to magnetic fields in the framework of the pnjl model with eight - quark interaction . in doing this",
    ", we will consider quarks with finite values of bare mass , fixed to reproduce the vacuum pion mass , while in a previous study  @xcite this problem was studied only in the chiral limit .",
    "moreover , we compute the dressed polyakov loop , @xmath2 , in a magnetic field . along this line , we anticipate one of our results , namely that the dressed polyakov loop , @xmath2 , is capable to feel both the polyakov loop and the chiral condensate crossovers , whatever the strength of the magnetic field is .",
    "this occurs despite the tiny split of the two crossovers , which we observe at sufficiently strong magnetic field strength .",
    "therefore , in view of an effective theory for finite temperature qcd in terms of just one order parameter , our results are encouraging .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the model we use . in section iii ,",
    "we show and discuss our numerical results . finally ,",
    "in section iv , we draw our conclusions .",
    "in this article , we model quark matter by the following lagrangian density @xmath3 \\nonumber \\\\          & & + g_8\\left[(\\bar q q)^2 + ( \\bar q i \\gamma_5 \\bm\\tau          q)^2\\right]^2~ , \\label{eq : lagr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which corresponds to the njl lagrangian with multi - quark interactions  @xcite . the covariant",
    "derivative embeds the quark coupling to the external magnetic field and to the background gluon field as well , as we will see explicitly below . in eq .",
    ", @xmath4 represents a quark field in the fundamental representation of color and flavor ( indices are suppressed for notational simplicity ) ; @xmath5 is the bare quark mass , which is fixed to reproduce the pion mass in the vacuum , @xmath6 mev .",
    "our interaction in eq .   consists of a four - quark term , whose coupling @xmath7 has inverse mass dimension two , and an eight - quark term , whose coupling constant @xmath8 has inverse mass dimension eight .",
    "the evaluation of the bulk thermodynamic quantities requires we compute the quantum effective action of the model .",
    "this can not be done exactly .",
    "hence , we rely ourselves to the one - loop approximation for the partition function , which amounts to take the classical contribution plus the fermion determinant .",
    "the one - loop thermodynamic potential of quark matter in external fields has been discussed in  @xcite , in the case of canonical antiperiodic boundary conditions ; following  @xcite , it is easy to generalize it to the more general case of twisted boundary conditions : @xmath9    in the previous equation , @xmath10 ; @xmath11 is a non - negative integer which labels the landau level ; @xmath12 counts the degeneracy of the @xmath13th landau level .",
    "we have put @xmath14 with @xmath15  .",
    "the arguments of the thermal exponentials are defined as @xmath16 with @xmath17 defined in eq .  .",
    "the vacuum part of the thermodynamic potential , @xmath18 , is ultraviolet divergent .",
    "this divergence is transmitted to the self - consistent equations which determine the chiral condensate and the expectation value of the polyakov loop . in this article",
    ", we use a smooth regularization procedure by introducing a form factor @xmath19 in the diverging zero - point energy .",
    "our choice of @xmath19 is @xmath20 we choose two values of @xmath21 , namely @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the potential term @xmath24 $ ] in eq .   is built by hand in order to reproduce the pure gluonic lattice data  @xcite . among several different potential choices  @xcite",
    "we adopt the following logarithmic form  @xcite , @xmath25 = t^4\\biggl\\{-\\frac{a(t)}{2 }    \\bar\\phi \\phi \\\\   & \\qquad + b(t)\\ln\\bigl [ 1 - 6\\bar pp + 4(\\bar p^3 + p^3 )    -3(\\bar pp)^2 \\bigr ] \\biggr\\ } \\ ; ,   \\end{split } \\label{eq : poly}\\ ] ] with three model parameters ( one of four is constrained by the stefan - boltzmann limit ) , @xmath26 the standard choice of the parameters reads  @xcite ; @xmath27 the parameter @xmath28 in eq .   sets the deconfinement scale in the pure gauge theory , i.e.  @xmath29 .",
    "following  @xcite , in order to define the dressed polyakov loop , we work in a finite euclidean volume with temperature extension @xmath30 .",
    "we take twisted fermion boundary conditions along the compact temporal direction , @xmath31~ , \\label{eq : phi}\\ ] ] while for spatial directions the usual periodic boundary condition is taken .",
    "the canonical antiperiodic boundary condition for the quantization of fermions at finite temperature , is obtained by taking @xmath32 in the previous equation .",
    "the dual quark condensate , @xmath33 , is defined as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an integer .",
    "the expectation value @xmath36 denotes the path integral over gauge field configurations .",
    "an important point is that in the computation of the expectation value , the twisted boundary conditions acts only on the fermion determinant ; the gauge fields are taken to be quantized with the canonical periodic boundary condition .    using a lattice regularization , it has been shown in  @xcite that eq .",
    "can be expanded in terms of loops which wind @xmath35 times along the compact time direction . in particular , the case @xmath37 is called the dressed polyakov loop ; it corresponds to a sum of loops winding just once along the time direction .",
    "these correspond to the thin polyakov loop ( the loop with shortest length ) plus higher order loops , the order being proportional to the length of the loop .",
    "each higher order loop is weighed by an inverse power of the quark mass . because of the weight , in the infinite quark mass limit",
    "only the thin polyakov loop survives ; for this reason , the dressed polyakov loop can be viewed as a mathematical dressing of the thin loop , by virtue of longer loops , the latter being more and more important as the quark mass tends to smaller values .    if we denote by @xmath38 an element of the center of the color gauge group , then it is easy to show that @xmath39 .",
    "it then follows that , under the center of the symmetry group @xmath40 , the dressed polyakov loop is an order parameter for the center symmetry , with the same transformation rule of the thin polyakov loop .",
    "since the center symmetry is spontaneously broken in the deconfinement phase and restored in the confinement phase  @xcite ( in presence of dynamical quarks , it is only approximately restored ) , the dressed polyakov loop can be regarded as an order parameter for the confinement - deconfinement transition as well .    for later convenience , we scale the definition of the dressed polyakov loop in eq .  , and",
    "introduce @xmath41 where @xmath42 corresponds to the expectation value of the @xmath43 field computed keeping twisted boundary conditions for fermions .",
    "in this section , we show our results .",
    "the main goal to achieve numerically is the solution of the gap equations , @xmath44 this is done by using a globally convergent algorithm with backtrack  @xcite . from the very definition of the dressed polyakov loop , eq .",
    ", the twisted boundary condition , eq .  , must be imposed only in @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , we firstly compute the expectation value of the polyakov loop and to the chiral condensate , taking @xmath46 . then , in order to compute the dressed polyakov loop using eq .",
    ", we compute the @xmath17-dependent chiral condensate using the first of eq .  , keeping the expectation value of the polyakov loop fixed at its value at @xmath46  @xcite .",
    ".[tab : para]parameters of the model for the two choices of the uv - regulator . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the picture discussed in the previous section is made clear by the phase diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd7 ] .",
    "we measure an increase of both deconfinement and chiral crossovers ; the tiny split of the two critical temperatures is of the order of @xmath1 for the largest value of the magnetic field strength considered here .",
    "it is instructive to compare our results with those obtained in a different model .",
    "the shape of the phase diagram drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd7 ] is similar to that drawn by the polyakov extended quark - meson model , see e.g. fig .",
    "13 of ref .",
    "@xcite . in that reference ,",
    "an interpretation of the split in terms of the interplay among vacuum and thermal contribution , is given .",
    "we totally agree with those arguments , which are reproduced within the pnjl model as well , as the final results on critical temperatures show . in the case of the quark - meson model , however , the picture can change even qualitatively , depending on the fate of vacuum energy contribution .",
    "if they are not included , then a simultaneous first order transition is observed at every value of @xmath47 ( only if @xmath47 is very small the transition is a smooth crossover ) , and the deconfinement temperature as a function of the magnetic field strength _",
    "decreases_. this picture confirms the scenario anticipated in a previous work  @xcite . in the case of the pnjl model ,",
    "we can not reproduce the latter scenario , because of a technical reason : indeed , in our case the vacuum contribution can not be subtracted ( as a matter of fact , we do not have a further effective potential term at zero temperature , which leads to spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry when vacuum quark contributions are subtracted ) .",
    "therefore , we can limit ourselves only to a comparison with the quark - meson model with vacuum contributions taken into account .",
    "we have computed , for the first time in the literature , the dressed polyakov loop for hot quark matter in external magnetic field . to compute the finite temperature effective potential in magnetic field ,",
    "we have used the polyakov extended nambu - jona lasinio model , with a logarithm effective action for the polyakov loop . in the quark sector , we have used both a four - quark and an eight - quark interactions .",
    "bare quark masses are fixed to reproduce the physical value of the vacuum pion mass .",
    "this model allows to treat self - consistently both chiral symmetry breaking and ( effective , or statistical ) confinement .",
    "we improve the previous work  @xcite in three ways : we set the vacuum pion mass to its physical value ; we introduce eight - quark interaction ; finally , we compute the dressed polyakov loop .",
    "our results on the dressed polyakov loop , @xmath2 , in magnetic field show that this quantity is capable to describe both polyakov loop and chiral crossovers .",
    "this is resumed in the double peak structure of the effective susceptibility @xmath48 , see figs.[fig : s3d ] and  [ fig : pd7 ] .",
    "moreover , we find that @xmath2 is capable to feel both the polyakov loop crossover and the chiral condensate crossover , and suggests itself as the the possibly unique order parameter of effective qcd .    the results on the pseudo - critical temperatures as a function of @xmath47 are resumed in the phase diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd7 ] .",
    "these results were anticipated in a previous work  @xcite in which only the chiral limit was considered , and the eight quark interaction was neglected .",
    "our results agree qualitatively with those of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which a quark - meson model coupled to the polyakov loop is considered .    as improvement of our results , it would be interesting to consider the effects of non - locality  @xcite . in that case , however , the computation of the fermion spectrum in the magnetic field is not trivial because of the non - local structure of the action .",
    "another interesting possibility is the use of montecarlo methods to compute the pnjl partition function in magnetic field , going beyond the saddle approximation .",
    "encouraging results along this research line in the context of the pnjl model have been reported in  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it might be interesting to extend the computation of  @xcite to the case of quarks in external magnetic field .",
    "even more , we expect that the running coupling introduced by the kyushu s group  @xcite would help ( at least partly ) to get closer crossovers in magnetic field .",
    "a numerical investigation of this subject is left to a future study .",
    "finally , the extension of our calculation to finite quark chemical potential , and to quark matter in external chromo - magnetic fields , the latter being motivated by lattice results  @xcite , would deserve further attention .",

    "<S> we evaluate the dressed polyakov loop for hot quark matter in strong magnetic field . to compute the finite temperature effective potential </S>",
    "<S> , we use the polyakov extended nambu - jona lasinio model with eight - quark interactions taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the bare quark mass is adjusted in order to reproduce the physical value of the vacuum pion mass . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the dressed polyakov loop is very sensitive to the strenght of the magnetic field , and it is capable to capture both the deconfinement crossover and the chiral crossover . </S>",
    "<S> besides , we compute self - consistently the phase diagram of the model . </S>",
    "<S> we find a tiny split of the two aforementioned crossovers as the strength of the magnetic field is increased . </S>",
    "<S> concretely , for the largest value of magnetic field investigated here , @xmath0 , the split is of the order of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> a qualitative comparison with other effective models and recent lattice results is also performed . </S>"
