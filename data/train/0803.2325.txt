    "this paper deals with _ isostatic _ frameworks , i.e. , pin - jointed bar assemblies , commonly referred to in engineering literature as truss structures , that are both kinematically and statically determinate .",
    "such systems are minimally infinitesimally rigid and maximally stress free : they can be termed ` just rigid ' .",
    "our ultimate goal is to answer the question posed in the title : when are symmetric pin - jointed frameworks isostatic ? as a first step ,",
    "the present paper provides a series of _ necessary _ conditions obeyed by isostatic frameworks that possess symmetry , and also summarizes conjectures and initial results on _ sufficient _ conditions .",
    "frameworks provide a model that is useful in applications ranging from civil engineering ( graver , 2001 ) and the study of granular materials ( donev et al . , 2004 ) to biochemistry ( whiteley 2005 ) .",
    "many of these model frameworks have symmetry . in applications ,",
    "both practical and theoretical advantages accrue when the framework is isostatic . in a number of applications ,",
    "point symmetry of the framework appears naturally , and it is therefore of interest to understand the impact of symmetry on the rigidity of the framework .",
    "maxwell ( 1864 ) formulated a necessary condition for infinitesimal rigidity , a counting rule for 3d pin - jointed structures , with an obvious counterpart in 2d ; these were later refined by calladine ( 1978 ) .",
    "laman ( 1970 ) provided sufficient criteria for infinitesimal rigidity in 2d , but there are well known problems in extending this to 3d ( graver et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "the maxwell counting rule , and its extensions , can be re - cast to take account of symmetry ( fowler and guest , 2000 ) using the language of point - group representations ( see , e.g. , bishop , 1973 ) .",
    "the symmetry - extended maxwell rule gives additional information from which it has often been possible to detect and explain ` hidden ' mechanisms and states of self - stress in cases where the standard counting rules give insufficient information ( fowler and guest , 2002 ; 2005 , schulze 2008a ) .",
    "similar symmetry extensions have been derived for other classical counting rules ( ceulemans and fowler , 1991 ; guest and fowler , 2005 ) .    in the present paper",
    ", we will show that the symmetry - extended maxwell rule can be used to provide necessary conditions for a finite framework possessing symmetry to be stress - free and infinitesimally rigid , i.e. , isostatic .",
    "it turns out that symmetric isostatic frameworks must obey some simply stated restrictions on the counts of structural components that are fixed by various symmetries . for 2d systems ,",
    "these restrictions imply that isostatic structures must have symmetries belonging to one of only six point groups . for 3d systems , all point groups are possible , as convex triangulated polyhedra ( isostatic by the theorems of cauchy and dehn ( cauchy 1813 , dehn 1916 ) ) can be constructed in all groups ( section  [ sec:3diso ] ) , although restrictions on the placement of structural components may still apply .    for simplicity in this presentation",
    ", we will restrict our configurations to realisations in which all joints are distinct .",
    "thus , if we consider an abstract representation of the framework as a graph , with vertices corresponding to joints , and edges corresponding to bars , then we are assuming that the mapping from the graph to the geometry of the framework is injective on the vertices .",
    "complications can arise in the non - injective situation , and will be considered separately ( schulze , 2008a ) .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : maxwell s rule , and its symmetry extended version , are introduced in section  [ sec : back ] , where a symmetry - extended version of a necessary condition for a framework to be isostatic is given , namely the equisymmetry of the representations for mechanisms and states of self - stress . in section  [ sec : calc ]",
    "the calculations are carried out in 2d , leading to restrictions on the symmetries and configurations of 2d isostatic frameworks , and in 3d , leading to restrictions on the placement of structural components with respect to symmetry elements . in section  [ sec : laman ] we conjecture sufficient conditions for a framework realized generically for a symmetry group to be isostatic , both in the plane and in 3d .",
    "maxwell s rule ( maxwell , 1864 ) in its modern form ( calladine , 1978 ) , @xmath0 expresses a condition for the determinacy of an unsupported , three - dimensional pin - jointed frame , in terms of counts of structural components . in equation  ( [ eq : calladine ] ) ,",
    "@xmath1 is the number of bars , @xmath2 is the number of joints , @xmath3 is the number of infinitesimal internal mechanisms and @xmath4 is the number of states of self - stress .",
    "a statically determinate structure has @xmath5 ; a kinematically determinate structure has @xmath6 ; isostatic structures have @xmath7 .",
    "the form of ( [ eq : calladine ] ) arises from a comparison of the dimensions of the underlying vector spaces that are associated with the equilibrium , or equivalently the compatibility , relationships for the structure ( pellegrino and calladine , 1986 ) .",
    "firstly , the equilibrium relationship can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the _ equilibrium _ matrix ; @xmath10 is a vector of internal bar forces ( tensions ) , and lies in a vector space of dimension @xmath1 ; @xmath11 is an assignment of externally applied forces , one to each joint , and , as there are @xmath12 possible force components , @xmath11 lies in a vector space of dimension @xmath12 ( this vector space is the tensor product of a @xmath2-dimensional vector space resulting from assigning a scalar to each joint , and a @xmath13-dimensional vector space in which a 3d force vector can be defined ) . hence @xmath9 is a @xmath14 matrix .",
    "a state of self - stress is a solution to @xmath15 , i.e. , a vector in the nullspace of @xmath9 ; if @xmath9 has rank @xmath16 , the dimension of this nullspace is @xmath17    further , the compatibility relationship can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the _ compatibility _ matrix ; @xmath20 is a vector of infinitesimal bar extensions , and lies in a vector space of dimension @xmath1 ; @xmath21 is a vector of infinitesimal nodal displacements , there are @xmath12 possible nodal displacements and so @xmath21 lies in a vector space of dimension @xmath12 . hence @xmath19 is a @xmath22 matrix .",
    "in fact , it is straightforward to show ( see e.g. , pellegrino and calladine , 1986 ) that @xmath19 is identical to @xmath23 .",
    "the matrix @xmath19 is closely related to the rigidity matrix commonly used in the mathematical literature : the rigidity matrix is formed by multiplying each row of @xmath19 by the length of the corresponding bar .",
    "of particular relevance here is that fact that the rigidity matrix and @xmath19 have an identical nullspace .",
    "a _ mechanism _ is a solution to @xmath24 , i.e. , a vector in the left - nullspace of @xmath9 , and the dimension of this space is @xmath25 .",
    "however , this space has a basis comprised of @xmath3 internal mechanisms and @xmath26 rigid - body mechanisms , and hence @xmath27 eliminating @xmath16 from ( [ eq : s ] ) and ( [ eq : m ] ) recovers maxwell s equation ( [ eq : calladine ] ) .",
    "the above derivation assumes that the system is @xmath13-dimensional , but it can be applied to @xmath28-dimensional frameworks , simply replacing @xmath29 by @xmath30 : @xmath31      the scalar formula ( [ eq : calladine ] ) has been shown ( fowler and guest , 2000 ) to be part of a more general symmetry version of maxwell s rule . for a framework with point group symmetry",
    "@xmath32 ,    3d : @xmath33 ( )    where each @xmath34 is known in applied group theory as a _ representation _ of @xmath35 ( bishop , 1973 ) , or in mathematical group theory as a _ character _ ( james and liebeck , 2001 ) . for any set of objects @xmath36",
    ", @xmath37 can be considered as a vector , or ordered set , of the traces of the transformation matrices @xmath38 that describe the transformation of @xmath36 under each symmetry operation @xmath39 that lies in @xmath35 . in this way , ( [ eq : sm ] )",
    "may be considered as a set of equations , one for each class of symmetry operations in @xmath35 .",
    "alternatively , and equivalently , each @xmath37 can be written as the sum of irreducible representations / characters of @xmath35 ( bishop , 1973 ) . in ( [ eq : sm ] ) the various sets @xmath36 are sets of bars @xmath1 , joints @xmath2 , mechanisms @xmath3 and states of self - stress @xmath4 ; @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the translational and rotational representations , respectively . calculations using ( [ eq : sm ] ) can be completed by standard manipulations of the character table of the group ( atkins , child and phillips , 1970 ; bishop , 1973 ; altmann and herzig , 1994 ) .",
    "the restriction of ( [ eq : sm ] ) to @xmath28-dimensional systems ( assumed to lie in the @xmath42-plane ) is made by replacing @xmath40 with @xmath43 and @xmath41 with @xmath44 , as appropriate to the reduced set of rigid - body motions .",
    "2d : @xmath45 ( )    examples of the application of ( [ eq : sm ] ) , ( [ eq : sm2 ] ) , with detailed working , can be found in fowler and guest ( 2000 ; 2002 ; 2005 ) , and further background , giving explicit transformation matrices , will be found in kangwai and guest ( 2000 ) .    in the context of the present paper , we are interested in isostatic systems , which have @xmath46 , and hence obey the symmetry condition @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , the symmetry maxwell equation ( [ eq : sm ] ) , ( [ eq : sm2 ] ) gives the necessary condition @xmath48 , as it can not detect the presence of paired equisymmetric mechanisms and states of self stress .",
    "the symmetry - extended maxwell equation corresponds to a set of @xmath49 scalar equations , where @xmath49 is the number of irreducible representations of @xmath35 ( the number of rows in the character table ) , or equivalently the number of conjugacy classes of @xmath35 ( the number of columns in the character table ) .",
    "the former view has been used in previous papers ; the latter will be found useful in the present paper for deriving restrictions on isostatic frameworks .",
    "that existence of symmetry typically imposes restrictions on isostatic frameworks can be seen from some simple general considerations .",
    "consider a framework having point - group symmetry @xmath50 .",
    "suppose that we place all bars and joints freely ( so that no bar or joint is mapped onto itself by any symmetry operation ) . both @xmath1 and @xmath2 must then be multiples of @xmath51 , the order of the group : @xmath52 , @xmath53",
    "can such a framework be isostatic ?",
    "any isostatic framework obeys the scalar maxwell rule with @xmath54 as a necessary condition . in three dimensions",
    ", we have @xmath55 , and hence :    3d : @xmath56     in two dimensions , we have @xmath57 , and hence :    2d : @xmath58     as @xmath59 and @xmath60 are integers , @xmath61 is restricted to values @xmath62 , @xmath28 , @xmath13 and @xmath26 in 3d , and @xmath62 and @xmath13 in 2d .",
    "immediately we have that if the point group order is not one of these special values , it is impossible to construct an isostatic framework with all structural components placed freely : any isostatic framework with @xmath63 ( 2d ) or @xmath64 ( 3d ) must have some components in _ special positions _ ( components that are unshifted by some symmetry operation ) .    in the schoenflies notation ( bishop , 1973 ) , the point groups of orders 1 , 2 , 3 and 6 are    [ cols= \"",

    "some observations on 3d isostatic frameworks , arising from the above , are :    1 .   from ( [ eq:3de ] ) , the framework must satisfy the scalar maxwell rule ( [ eq : calladine ] ) with @xmath54 .",
    "2 .   from ( [ eq:3dv ] ) , each mirror that is present contains the same number of joints as bars that are unshifted under reflection in that mirror .",
    "3 .   from ( [ eq:3di ] ) , a centro - symmetric framework has neither a joint nor a bar centered at the inversion centre .",
    "4 .   for a @xmath74 axis ,",
    "( [ eq:3dc2 ] ) has solutions @xmath80 the count @xmath81 refers to both bars that lie along , and those that lie perpendicular to , the axis .",
    "however , if a bar were to lie along the @xmath74 axis , it would contribute @xmath62 to @xmath81 and @xmath28 to @xmath82 thus generating a contradiction of ( [ eq:3dc2 ] ) , so that in fact all bars included in @xmath81 must lie perpendicular to the axis .",
    "equation ( [ eq:3dcn ] ) can be written , with @xmath83 , as @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "the non - negative integer solution @xmath86 , @xmath87 , is possible for all @xmath88 . for @xmath85",

    "@xmath95 : :    @xmath96    +    @xmath97 implies @xmath98 about the same    axis , and hence @xmath99 , and    @xmath100 . @xmath101 : :    @xmath102    +    @xmath103 implies @xmath104 and    @xmath105 about the same axis , and hence    @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "+ thus @xmath108 is @xmath109 for any @xmath85 , and only in the case @xmath91 may @xmath110 depart from @xmath28 .",

    "the requirement that @xmath125 for each 5-fold axis implies that the framework must include a single orbit of @xmath126 vertices that are the vertices of an icosahedron .",
    "similarly , for a framework with a @xmath127 or @xmath128 symmetry , the requirement that @xmath129 implies that the framework must include a single orbit of @xmath26 vertices that are the vertices of an octahedron .",
    "in contrast to the 2d case , in 3d the symmetry conditions do not exclude any point group . for example , a fully triangulated convex polyhedron , isostatic by the theorem of cauchy and dehn ( cauchy 1813 ; dehn 1916 ) can be constructed to realize any 3d point group .",
    "beginning with the regular triangulated polyhedra ( the tetrahedron , octahedron , icosahedron ) , infinite families of isostatic frameworks can be constructed by expansions of these polyhedra using operations of truncation and capping . for example , to generate isostatic frameworks with only the rotational symmetries of a given triangulated polyhedron , we can ` cap ' each face with a twisted octahedron , consistent with the rotational symmetries of the underlying polyhedron : the resultant polyhedron will be an isostatic framework with the rotational symmetries of the underlying polyhedron , but none of the reflection symmetries .",
    "an example of the capping of a regular octahedron is shown in figure  [ fig : twistcap ] .",
    "similar techniques can be applied to create polyhedra for any of the point groups .",
    "+ ( a ) ( b )    one interesting possibility arises from consideration of groups that contain @xmath130 axes .",
    "equation ( [ eq:3dcn ] ) allows an unlimited number of joints , though not bars , along a 3-fold symmetry axis .",
    "thus , starting with an isostatic framework , joints may be added symmetrically along the 3-fold axes . to preserve the maxwell count ,",
    "each additional joint is accompanied by @xmath13 new bars .",
    "thus , for instance , we can ` cap ' every face of an icosahedron to give the compound icosahedron - plus - dodecahedron ( the second stellation of the icosahedron ) , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : ico ] , and this process can be continued ad infinitum adding a pile of ` hats ' consisting of a new joint , linked to all three joints of an original icosahedral face ( figure  [ fig : cap ] ) .",
    "similar constructions starting from cubic and trigonally symmetric isostatic frameworks can be envisaged .",
    "addition of a single ` hat ' to a triangle of a framework is one of the hennenberg moves ( tay & whiteley 1985 ) : changes that can be made to an isostatic framework without introducing extra mechanisms or states of self stress .     + ( a ) ( b )",
    "for a framework with point - group symmetry @xmath35 the previous section has provided some necessary conditions for the realization to be isostatic .",
    "these conditions included some over - all counts on bars and joints , along with sub - counts on special classes of bars and joints ( bars on mirrors or perpendicular to mirrors , bars centered on the axis of rotation , joints on the centre of rotation etc . ) . here , assuming that the framework is realized with the joints in a configuration as generic as possible ( subject to the symmetry conditions ) , we investigate whether these conditions are sufficient to guarantee that the framework is isostatic .",
    "the simplest case is the identity group ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "for this basic situation , the key result is laman s theorem . in the following ,",
    "we take @xmath132 to define the connectivity of the framework , where @xmath133 is the set of @xmath2 joints and @xmath134 the set of @xmath1 bars , and we take @xmath135 to define the positions of all of the joints in 2d .",
    "[ laman ] ( laman , 1970 ) for a generic configuration in 2d , @xmath135 , the framework @xmath136 is isostatic if and only if @xmath132 satisfies the conditions :    1 .",

    "set of bars @xmath138 , which contacts just the joints in @xmath139 , with @xmath140 and @xmath141 , @xmath142 .",
    "our goal is to extend these results to other symmetry groups . with the appropriate definition of ` generic ' for symmetry groups ( schulze 2008a )",
    ", we can anticipate that the necessary conditions identified in the previous sections for the corresponding group plus the laman condition identified in theorem [ laman ] , which considers subgraphs that are not necessarily symmetric , will be sufficient . for three of the plane symmetry groups ,",
    "this has been confirmed .",
    "we use the previous notation for the point groups and the identification of special bars and joints , and describe a configuration as ` generic with symmetry group @xmath35 ' if , apart from conditions imposed by symmetry , the points are in a generic position ( the constraints imposed by the local site symmetry may remove 0,1 or 2 of the two basic freedoms of the point ) .",
