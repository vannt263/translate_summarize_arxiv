    "the optical and near - infrared spectral energy distributions of very low mass stars and brown dwarfs  late - type m , l and t dwarfs  are distinctly non - blackbody .",
    "overlapping molecular bands and strong line emission produce a rich array of spectral diagnostics for classification and characterization of physical properties .",
    "considerable effort is now being devoted toward decrypting the spectral fingerprints of late - type dwarfs to determine masses , ages , metallicities and other fundamental parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in some cases",
    ", spectral peculiarities arise when an observed source is in fact an unresolved multiple system , with components of different masses , effective temperatures , and other spectral properties . while several classes of stellar multiples are recognized on the basis of their unusual spectral or photometric properties ( u geminorum stars , m dwarf + white dwarf systems , etc . ) , identifying such cases amongst late - type dwarfs is complicated by the influence of other physical effects .",
    "delineation of spectral peculiarities that arise purely from multiplicity as opposed to other physical effects is essential if we hope to unambiguously characterize the physical properties of the lowest luminosity stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "very low mass multiple systems are important in their own right , as they enable mass and occasionally radius measurements ( e.g. , @xcite ) , provide constraints for star / brown dwarf formation scenarios ( e.g. , @xcite ) and facilitate detailed studies of atmospheric properties ( e.g. , @xcite ) . of the roughly 90 very low mass multiple systems currently known",
    ", the majority have been identified through high angular resolution imaging , using the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ; e.g. , @xcite ) , ground - based adaptive optics systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) and more recently aperture masking interferometry ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". however , as the vast majority of very low mass binaries have small separations ( @xmath390% have @xmath4 @xmath5 20  au ; @xcite ) , expanding the population of known binaries to greater distances requires either finer angular sampling or the identification of systems that are unresolved .",
    "the frequency of nearby , tightly - bound binaries is also essential for a complete assessment of the overall very low mass dwarf binary fraction , since imaging studies provide only a lower limit to this fundamental statistic .",
    "such systems are also more likely to eclipse , enabling radius measurements and fundamental tests of evolutionary models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while searches for radial velocity variability via high resolution spectroscopy can be useful in this regime ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in many cases very low luminosity and/or distant late - type dwarfs are simply too faint to be followed up in this manner .",
    "recently , @xcite demonstrated that in certain cases the presence of an unresolved companion can be inferred directly from the morphology of a source s low - resolution near - infrared spectrum .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the spectrum of the peculiar l dwarf sdss  j080531.84 + 481233.0 ( hereafter sdss  j0805 + 4812 ; @xcite ) , which has highly discrepant optical and near - infrared spectral classifications , could be accurately reproduced as a combination of `` normal '' l4.5 + t5 components .",
    "indeed , the binary hypothesis provides a far simpler and more consistent explanation for the unusual optical , near - infrared and mid - infrared properties of sdss  j0805 + 4812 than other alternatives ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the identification of unresolved multiples like sdss  j0805 + 4812 by low - resolution near - infrared spectroscopy is a potential boon for low - mass multiplicity studies , as this method is not subject to the same physical or projected separation limitations inherent to high - resolution imaging and spectroscopic techniques .",
    "this article reports the discovery of a second unresolved very low mass binary system , 2mass  j03202839@xmath00446358 ( hereafter 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 ) , identified by the morphology of its low - resolution , near - infrared spectrum .",

    "the near - infrared spectrum of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 is shown in figure  [ fig_nirspec ] , compared to equivalent data for the optical spectral standards vb  10 ( m8 ; @xcite ) and 2mass  j14392836 + 1929149 ( l1 , hereafter 2mass  j1439 + 1929 ; @xcite ) . despite the poor observing conditions , the data for 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 have exceptionally good signal - to - noise , @xmath17150 in the @xmath18 flux peaks and @xmath1950 in the bottom of the 1.4 and 1.8  @xmath1 h@xmath20o bands . color biases due to telluric cloud absorption do not appear to be present , as indicated by comparison of 2mass photometry and synthetic @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 colors computed from the spectral data , which agree to within the photometric uncertainties .",
    "the morphology of the near - infrared spectrum of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 is typical of a late - type m or early - type l dwarf , with bands of tio and vo absorption at red optical wavelengths ( @xmath24  ) ; prominent h@xmath20o absorption at 1.4 and 1.8  @xmath1 ; feh absorption at 0.99 , 1.2 and 1.55  @xmath1 ; and line absorption in the 1.0 - 1.3  @xmath1 region ; weak lines at 2.2  @xmath1 ; and strong co bandheads at 2.32.4  @xmath1 . for the most part , the spectrum of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 is more consistent with that of 2mass  j1439 + 1929 ; note in particular the similarities in the overall shape of the 1.01.35  @xmath1 @xmath14-band flux peak and the deep 1.4  @xmath1 h@xmath20o band .",
    "however , tio and vo bands are more similar to ( but weaker than ) those seen in the spectrum of vb  10 , while the weak 2.2  @xmath1 lines are rarely seen in l dwarf spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the near - infrared spectrum of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 is also somewhat bluer than that of 2mass  j1439 + 1929 , in line with their respective colors ( @xmath23 = 1.13@xmath20.04 versus 1.21@xmath20.03 ) .",
    "the similarities to 2mass  j1439 + 1929 suggests an l1 near - infrared spectral type for 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 , which is confirmed by examination of the spectral indices and index / spectral type relations defined by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "this classification is fully three subtypes later than the m8 : optical spectral type reported by @xcite .",

    "@xcite and @xcite have found disagreements of up to 1.5  subtypes between optical ( based on the @xcite scheme ) and near - infrared classifications ( based on their own scheme ) for several l dwarfs .",
    "@xcite have discussed a subclass of unusually blue l dwarfs whose optical classifications are consistently 2 - 3 subtypes earlier than their near - infrared classifications .",
    "such discrepancies have been variously attributed to surface gravity , metallicity , condensate cloud or multiplicity effects ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the large @xmath13 of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 , indicating that this source may be somewhat older , suggests that high surface gravity and/or slightly subsolar metallicity could explain the discrepant optical and near - infrared spectral classifications .",
    "however , 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 exhibits one unusual feature not seen in the comparison spectra in figure  [ fig_nirspec ] , a slight dip at 1.6  @xmath1 , that suggests multiplicity is relevant in this case .",
    "the 1.6  @xmath1 feature is nearly coincident with the 1.57 - 1.64  @xmath1 feh absorption band commonly observed in l dwarf near - infrared spectra @xcite . yet",
    "its morphology is clearly different , with a cup - shaped depression as opposed to the flat plateau seen in the comparison spectra of figure  [ fig_nirspec ] .",
    "more importantly , this feature has the same morphology and is centered at the same wavelength as the peculiar feature noted in the spectrum of sdss  j0805 + 4812 @xcite . in that case , the 1.6  @xmath1 feature and other spectral peculiarities were attributed to the presence of a mid - type t dwarf companion .",
    "given the similar discrepancy in optical and near - infrared classifications for sdss  j0805 + 4812 ( l4 and l9.5 , respectively ) , it is reasonable to consider whether 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 also harbors a faint t dwarf companion .      in an attempt to search for faint companions ,",
    "2mass  j0320@xmath00446 was imaged on 2008  january  15 ( ut ) with the sodium lgs ao system @xcite and facility near - infrared camera nirc2 on the 10 m keck telescope .",
    "conditions were photometric with average / below - average seeing .",

    "all observations were conducted using the mko @xmath28-band filter .",
    "the lgs provided the wavefront reference source for ao correction , while tip - tilt aberrations and quasi - static changes were measured contemporaneously by monitoring the @xmath29  mag field star usno - b1.0  0852@xmath00031783 @xcite , located 14  away from 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 .",
    "the lgs , with an equivalent brightness of a @xmath30 mag star , was pointed at the center of the nirc2 field - of - view for all observations .",
    "2mass  j0320@xmath00446 was imaged using two different methods in order to probe the widest possible range of projected separations : ( 1 )  direct imaging and ( 2 )  aperture mask interferometry . in the first case ,",
    "a series of 3 dithered 60-second images was obtained , offsetting the telescope by a few arcseconds between exposures , for a total integration time of 180  seconds .",
    "raw frames were reduced using standard procedures .",
    "normalized flat field frames were constructed from the differences of images of the telescope dome interior with and without continuum lamp illumination .",
    "a master sky frame was created from the median average of the bias - subtracted , flat - fielded images and subtracted from the individual exposures .",
    "individual frames were registered and stacked to form a final mosaic imaged .",
    "the observations achieved a point spread function ( psf ) full - width at half - maximum of 007 and a strehl ratio of 0.21 . with the exception of the primary target , no sources were detected in a @xmath31 region centered on 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 .",
    "aperture mask observations were also obtained with the lgs ao+nirc2 instrumental setup . in this method ,",
    "a 9-hole aperture mask is placed in a filter wheel near a re - imaged pupil plane within the nirc2 camera .",
    "the mask has non - redundant spacing , so each fourier component of the recorded image corresponds to a unique pair of patches on the keck primary mirror .",
    "the primary interferometric observables of squared visibility and closure - phase are therefore calibrated much better than images using the full aperture .",
    "this technique has a long history of achieving the full diffraction limit of a telescope ( e.g. @xcite ) and has been recently applied to natural guide star ao observations at keck @xcite .",
    "this is the first application of aperture mask interferometry to lgs ao observations that we are aware of .",
    "2mass  j0320@xmath00446 was observed in this setup using a two - point dither pattern , with five 50-second integrations at each dither position . the nearby field star 2mass  j03381363@xmath00332508 , which has a similar @xmath28-band brightness and tip - tilt star asterism as 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 ,",
    "was contemporaneously observed to calibrate both instrumental closure phase and visibility .",
    "images of the interferograms formed by the mask were recorded by the nirc2 detector , and squared visibilities and closure - phases were extracted from the image fourier transforms .",
    "raw visibility amplitudes were @xmath190.05 on the longest baselines .",
    "the closure phases for this calibrator star were subtracted from those of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 , while the calibrator s squared visibilities were divided into those of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 .",
    "the one - sigma scatter in the calibrated closure phase was 5@xmath11 . using standard analysis techniques ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", we found no evidence of a binary solution in the data .",
    "upper limits on the presence of a faint companion to 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 were computed separately for the direct imaging and aperture mask observations . for the direct imaging data ,",
    "upper limits were determined by first smoothing the final mosaic with an analytical representation of the psf s radial profile , modeled as the sum of multiple gaussians .",
    "we then measured the standard deviation of flux counts in concentric annuli out to 3@xmath32 in radius centered on the science target , normalized by the peak flux of the science target .",
    "we considered 10@xmath33 these values as the flux ratio limits for any companions , as visually verified by inserting fake sources into the image using translated and scaled versions of the science target .",
    "for the aperture mask data , detection limits at 99% confidence were calculated in three annuli spanning 0@xmath90200@xmath916 in separation ( the lower limit corresponding to the diffraction limit of the aperture mask ) using the monte - carlo approach described in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig_ao ] displays the resulting flux ratio limits for a faint companion as a function of separation for both datasets . at separations",
    "@xmath340@xmath925 , the aperture mask data exclude any companions with @xmath35 3  mag for separations down to 0@xmath904 .",
    "note that better seeing , as opposed to longer integrations , would have provided greater improvement in sensitivity in this range .",
    "the direct imaging observations exclude any companions with @xmath35 7  mag at separations @xmath36 , with the floor set primarily by sky shot noise and detector read noise .",
    "these limits are discussed further in @xmath6  4.1 .",
    "as an alternative method to identify and characterize a possible companion to 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 , a variant of the binary spectral template matching technique described in @xcite was applied to the near - infrared spectral data . in this method ,",
    "the spectrum of a late - type source is compared to a large set of binary spectral templates constructed from empirical data for m , l and t dwarfs .",
    "the component spectra of each binary template were scaled according to empirical absolute magnitude / spectral type relations . to minimize systematic effects , source and template spectra are required to have the same resolution and wavelength coverage , which is facilitated in this case by using a sample of nearly 200 spex prism spectra of m5t8 dwarfs drawn from the literature and our own unpublished observations .",
    "spectral types for the sources in this sample were assigned according to published classifications , based either on the optical classification schemes of @xcite and @xcite for m5l8 dwarfs or the near - infrared classification scheme of @xcite for l9t8 dwarfs ( m and l dwarfs with only near - infrared classifications reported were not included here ) .",
    "the initial spectral sample was purged of low signal - to - noise data as well as spectra of those sources known to be binary or noted as peculiar in the literature ( e.g. , low surface gravity brown dwarfs , subdwarfs , etc . ) .",
    "this left a sample of 132 spectra of 125 sources , listed in table  [ tab_templates ] .      to ascertain",
    "whether an unresolved binary truly provides a better fit to the spectrum of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 , comparisons were first made to individual sources in the spex sample .",
    "all spectra were initially normalized to their peak flux in the 1.21.3  @xmath1 band .",
    "the statistic @xmath37 was then computed between the 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 ( @xmath38 ) and template spectra ( @xmath39 ) , where @xmath40 ^ 2}{f_{\\lambda}(0320)}\\ ] ] ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the summation is performed over the wavelength ranges @xmath41 = 0.951.35  @xmath1 , 1.451.8  @xmath1 and 2.02.35  @xmath1 in order to avoid regions of strong telluric absorption .",
    "the denominator provides a rough estimate of shot noise in the spectral data , which is dominant in the highest signal - to - noise spectra , and therefore makes @xmath37 a rough approximation of the @xmath42 statistic.0446 and template data were taken , we chose not to include this term in our @xmath37 statistic . ] to eliminate normalization biases , each template spectrum was additionally scaled by a multiplicative factor in the range 0.51.5 to minimize @xmath37 .",

    "the fourth - best fit , the l1 2mass  j1493 + 1929 , was shown to provide an adequate match to the spectrum of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 in figure  [ fig_nirspec ] .",
    "the lehpm sources have large proper motions ( @xmath444  yr@xmath10 ) , notably similar to 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 .",
    "all four sources shown in figure  [ fig_single ] provide reasonably good matches to the broad near - infrared spectral energy distribution of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 , but with two key discrepancies : an absence of the 1.6  @xmath1 feature ( inset boxes in figure  [ fig_single ] ) and a shortfall in the peak spectral flux at 1.27  @xmath1 . in the first case",
    ", feh absorption bands are clearly seen in the comparison spectra but do not produce the distinct dip seen in the spectrum of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 . in the second case , the spectrum of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 is consistently brighter in the 1.21.35  @xmath1 range as compared to the ( appropriately scaled ) late - type m dwarf templates .",
    "as demonstrated below , both of these discrepancies can be resolved by the addition of a t dwarf component .",
    "binary spectral templates from the spex prism sample were constructed by first flux - calibrating each spectrum according to established absolute magnitude / spectral type relations . for m5-l5 dwarfs ,",
    "the 2mass @xmath7/spectral type relation of @xcite was used . for l5-t8 dwarfs ,",
    "both of the mko @xmath45/spectral type relations defined in @xcite were considered .",
    "the liu et al .",
    "relations are based on a sample of l and t dwarfs with measured pallaxes and mko photometry , but one relation ( `` bright '' ) was constructed after rejecting known ( resolved ) binaries while the other relation ( `` faint '' ) was constructed after rejecting all known and _ candidate _ binaries as described in that study . as illustrated in figure  3 of @xcite , these two relations envelope the @xmath45 values of currently measured sources ( including components of resolved binaries ) , but diverge by as much as @xmath191  mag for spectral types l8t5 .",
    "nevertheless , the @xcite relations represent our current best constraints on the absolute magnitude / spectral type relation across the l dwarf / t dwarf transition . in all cases ,",
    "synthetic magnitudes to scale the data were calculated directly from the spectra .",
    "binary templates were then constructed by adding together the calibrated spectra of source pairs whose types differ by at least 0.5 subclasses , producing a total of 8248 unique combinations .",
    "the binary templates were then normalized to their peak flux in the 1.21.3  @xmath1 band and compared to the spectrum of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 in the same manner as the single source templates ; i.e. , with additional scaling to minimize @xmath37 .",
    "figure  [ fig_double ] displays the best fitting binary templates constructed from the primaries shown in figure  [ fig_single ] and using the `` faint '' @xmath45/spectral type relation of @xcite . for all four cases , the addition of a mid - type t dwarf secondary spectrum considerably improves the spectral template match . in particular , the 1.6  @xmath1 spectral dip is very well reproduced , while the flux peaks at 1.27  @xmath1 in the binary templates are more consistent with the spectrum of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 . even detailed alkali line and feh features in the 0.91.3  @xmath1 region",
    "are better matched with the binary templates .",
    "figure  [ fig_double2 ] displays the best fitting binary templates using the `` bright '' @xmath45/spectral type relation of @xcite .",
    "there is a small degree of improvement in these fits over those using the `` faint '' @xmath45 relation , although the differences are very subtle due to the very small contribution of light by the t dwarf secondaries ( @xmath46 3.5  mag , depending on the components ) .",
    "this result is fortuitous , as it indicates that the better fits provided by the binary templates are only weakly dependent on the absolute magnitude relation assumed over a spectral type range in which such relations are currently most uncertain .",
    "besides the best - fit comparisons shown in figures  [ fig_double ] and  [ fig_double2 ] , there were many excellent matches ( @xmath47 ) found among binaries templates which had lehpm 1 - 6333 or 2mass  j1124 + 3808 as primaries : 30 for the `` faint '' @xmath45/spectral type relation and 58 for the `` bright '' relation .",
    "the average primary and secondary spectral types for the combinations in this well - matched sample are m8.5@xmath20.3 and t5.0@xmath20.9 , respectively , with no significant differences between analyses using the `` faint '' or `` bright '' @xmath45/spectral type relations .",

    "there is a large difference in the relative magnitudes between these two relations .",
    "if resolved photometry is eventually obtained for this system , such measurements could provide a means of distinguishing which of the absolute magnitude relations proposed in @xcite accurately characterize mid - type t dwarfs .",
    "the origin of the 1.6  @xmath1 feature in the spectrum of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 is clearly revealed in figures  [ fig_double ] and  [ fig_double2 ] : it is a combination of feh absorption in the m dwarf primary and ch@xmath54 absorption in the t dwarf secondary .",
    "specifically , the relatively sharp @xmath55-band flux peak in the spectrum of the t dwarf secondary blueward of the 1.6  @xmath1 ch@xmath54 band contributes light to the 1.551.6  @xmath1 spectrum of the composite system .",
    "this is on the blue end of the 1.55 - 1.65  @xmath1 feh absorption band , producing a distinct `` dip '' feature .",
    "similarly , the apparently brighter 1.21.35  @xmath1 flux in the spectrum of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 can be attributed to the t dwarf companion , which exhibits a narrow @xmath14-band peak between strong 1.1  @xmath1 and 1.4  @xmath1 h@xmath20o and ch@xmath54 bands .",
    "both spectral features are therefore unique to binaries containing late - type m and l dwarf primaries ( in which feh is prominent ) and t dwarf secondaries .",
    "it may be concluded from the analysis above that the near - infrared spectrum of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 , and in particular the subtle feature observed at 1.6  @xmath1 , can be accurately reproduced by assuming that this source is an unresolved m8.5 + t5 binary . but",
    "does this mean that 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 actually is a binary ?",
    "our lgs ao imaging observations failed to detect any faint secondaries near 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 to the limits displayed in figure  [ fig_ao ] .",
    "based on the `` bright '' mko @xmath45/spectral type relation of @xcite and the @xmath28/@xmath25 filter transformations of @xcite , the measured upper limits rule out a t5 companion wider than a projected separation of @xmath190@xmath933 , or roughly 8.3 au at the estimated distance of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 ( see below ) .",
    "this is a relatively weak constraint given that less than 25% of known very low mass binaries have projected separations at least this wide @xcite .",
    "furthermore , 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 could have been observed in an unfortunate geometry , as was originally the case for the l dwarf binary kelu  1 @xcite . on the other hand , if the physical separation of the 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 system is significantly smaller than indicated by the imaging observations , high resolution spectroscopic monitoring could potentially reveal radial velocity signatures , although this depends critically on the component masses of this system .",
    "indeed , the determination of a spectroscopic orbit in combination with the component spectral types deduced here would provide both mass and age constraints for this system , making it a potentially powerful benchmark test for evolutionary models .",
    "an alternative test of the binary hypothesis for 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 is to identify similar spectral traits in a comparable binary system .",
    "fortunately , one such system is known : the m8.5 + t6 binary scr 1845@xmath06357 @xcite .",
    "this nearby ( 3.85@xmath20.02  pc ; @xcite ) , well - resolved binary ( angular separation of 1@xmath91 ) has individually classified components based on resolved spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the relative near - infrared magnitudes of this system ( @xmath56  mag , @xmath57  mag , @xmath58  mag ; @xcite ) are somewhat larger than but consistent with the estimated relative magnitudes of the putative 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 system .",
    "figure  [ fig_scr1845 ] displays the component spectra of this system , scaled to their relative @xmath55-band magnitudes ,- band portion of the spectrum of scr  1845@xmath06357a shown here is slightly reduced relative to the @xmath55- and @xmath28-band spectra as shown to figure  2 in @xcite .",
    "the relative flux calibration between spectral orders applied in that study did not account for missing data over 1.331.50  @xmath1 , slightly inflating the flux levels in the @xmath14-band .",
    "a recalibration of this spectrum was made by scaling each order by a constant factor to match the spex prism spectrum of 2mass  j1124 + 3808 , which has a similar @xmath23 color ( 1.14@xmath20.03 versus 1.06@xmath20.03 for scr  1845@xmath06357 from @xcite ) and optical spectral type ( m8.5 ) .",
    "such recalibration is not necessary for the scr 1845@xmath06357b spectrum due to the strong 1.35  @xmath1 ch@xmath54 and 1.4  @xmath1 h@xmath20o bands in this source .",
    "the recalibration of the scr 1845@xmath06357a @xmath14-band spectrum does not affect the analysis presented here , which depends solely on the relative @xmath55-band scaling of the component spectra .",
    "] as well as the sum of the component spectra .",
    "the composite spectrum shows a relative increase in spectral flux as compared to the primary in both the 1.21.35  @xmath1 and 1.551.6  @xmath1 regions .",
    "indeed , the latter gives rise to the same `` dip '' feature observed in the @xmath55-band spectrum of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 , particularly when the scr 1845@xmath06357ab data are reduced in resolution to match that of the spex prism data ( inset box in figure  [ fig_scr1845 ] ) .",
    "the presence of this feature in the composite spectrum of a known m dwarf plus t dwarf binary lends some confidence to the conclusion that 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 is itself an m dwarf plus t dwarf binary .    assuming then that 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 is a system with m8.5 and t5 dwarf components , it is possible to characterize the physical properties of these components in some detail based on the analysis in @xmath6  3.3 .",
    "synthetic component @xmath18 magnitudes on the mko system assuming the `` bright '' @xmath45/spectral type relation of @xcite were computed from the best - fitting binary templates ( @xmath47 ) and are listed in table  [ tab_component ] .",
    "the m dwarf primary is only slightly fainter than the composite source , while the t dwarf companion is exceptionally faint , @xmath14 = 16.4@xmath20.4  mag .",
    "the low luminosity of the secondary , @xmath59 = -5.0@xmath20.3 dex based on its inferred spectral type @xcite , suggests that 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 could have a relatively low system mass ratio ( @xmath60 m@xmath20/m@xmath61 ) .",
    "however , the mass ratio depends critically on the age of the system , for which the analysis presented above provides no robust constraints . using the evolutionary models of @xcite and component luminosities",
    "as listed in table  [ tab_component ] , primary and secondary mass estimates for ages of 1 , 5 and 10  gyr were derived .",
    "if 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 is an older system , as suggested by its large @xmath13 , its inferred mass ratio @xmath62 @xmath3 0.8 is consistent with the typical mass ratios of very low mass binaries in the field ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "based on the primary s photometry and spectral type , and the @xmath7/spectral type relation of @xcite , a distance of 25@xmath23  pc is estimated for the 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 system .",
    "the subtlety of the peculiar features present in the composite spectra of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 and scr 1845@xmath06357 is due entirely to the considerable difference in flux between their m and t dwarf components . yet in both cases the 1.6  @xmath1 feature , indicating the presence of a t dwarf companion , can be discerned . but for how early of an primary can a binary with a t dwarf companion be identified in this manner , and what variety of t dwarf companions can be discerned in such systems ? to examine these questions ,",
    "figure  [ fig_mtsim ] displays binary spectral templates for four primary types ",
    "m7 , m8 , m9 and l0combined with t0t8 dwarf secondaries . for all cases ,",
    "the 1.6  @xmath1 feature is most pronounced when the secondary is a mid - type t dwarf , spectral types t3t5 .",
    "this is due to a tradeoff in the sharpness of the @xmath55-band flux peak in this component ( i.e. , the strength of 1.6  @xmath1 ch@xmath54 absorption , which deepens with later spectral types ) and its brightness relative to the primary .",
    "not surprisingly , the 1.6  @xmath1 feature is more pronounced in binaries with later - type primaries , making it a useful multiplicity diagnostic for l dwarf + t dwarf systems ( such as sdss  j0805 + 4812 ) but far more subtle in systems with m dwarf primaries .",
    "indeed , the spectra in figure  [ fig_mtsim ] suggest that this feature is basically undetectable in binaries with m7 and earlier - type primaries .",
    "2mass  j0320@xmath00446 and scr 1845@xmath06357 probably contain the earliest - type primaries for which a t dwarf secondary could be identified solely from their composite near - infrared spectra .",
    "it is also important to consider the other prominent spectral peculiarity caused by the presence of a t dwarf companion , the slight increase in flux at 1.3  @xmath1 .",
    "this feature increases the contrast in the 1.4  @xmath1 h@xmath20o band , and therefore serves to bias h@xmath20o spectral indices toward later subtypes .",
    "this effect explains why the near - infrared classification of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 is so much later than its optical classification ( the t dwarf secondary contributes negligible flux in the optical )",
    ". figure  [ fig_mtsim ] shows that the 1.3  @xmath1 flux increase can be discerned for systems with early- and mid - type t dwarf companions .",
    "while it is again more pronounced for systems with later - type primaries , it is still present ( but subtle ) in the spectra of systems with m7 primaries .",
    "a source with unusually strong absorption at 1.35  @xmath1 , or equivalently with a near - infrared spectral type that is significantly later than its optical spectral type , may harbor a t dwarf companion .",
    "however , other physical effects , notably reduced condensate opacity ( e.g. , @xcite ) , can also give rise to this spectral peculiarity .",
    "hence , both the contrast of the 1.4  @xmath1 h@xmath20o band and the presence of the 1.6  @xmath1 dip should be considered together as indicators of an unresolved t dwarf companion .    detecting the near - infrared spectral signature of a t dwarf companion",
    "need not be limited to low - resolution observations .",
    "while the dip feature at 1.6  @xmath1 is less pronounced in the higher - resolution composite spectrum of scr  1845@xmath06357ab from @xcite , individual ch@xmath54 lines may still be distinguishable amongst the many feh and h@xmath20o lines present in the same spectral region .",
    "it may also be possible to identify ch@xmath54 lins amongst the forest of h@xmath20o lines in the 1.30 - 1.35  @xmath1 region ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such detections require significantly higher resolutions , of order @xmath15 @xmath63 20,000 or more , due to the substantial overlap of the many molecular features present at these wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , an improved line list for the ch@xmath54 molecule may be needed @xcite . yet",
    "such observations have the potential to provide an additional check on the existence and characteristics of mid - type t dwarf companions in binaries with late - m / l dwarf primaries .",
    "relevant to the identification of late - type m dwarf plus t dwarf binaries from composite near - infrared spectra is the number of such systems that are expected to exist . as a rough estimate",
    ", we examined the results of the monte carlo mass function and multiplicity simulations presented in @xcite . using the baseline assumptions of these simulations  a mass function that scales as @xmath64 , a component mass range of 0.01 @xmath65 m @xmath65 0.1  m@xmath66 , a flat age distribution over 10  gyr , the @xcite evolutionary models , and a binary mass ratio distribution that scales as @xmath67 ( see @xcite)we found that 12 - 14% of binaries with m8l0 primaries are predicted to contain a t3t5 secondary ; i.e. , detectable with composite near - infrared spectroscopy .",
    "these are primarily older systems whose components that just straddle the hydrogen burning minimum mass limit ( @xmath190.07  m@xmath66 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the overall binary fraction of very low mass stars and brown dwarfs has been variously estimated to lie in the 1035% range ( e.g. @xcite ) , and is thus currently uncertain by over a factor of three . however , within this range the monte carlo simulations predict that 1 - 5% of _ all _ m8l0 dwarfs harbor a t3t5 dwarf companion . while this percentage is small , in a given magnitude - limited survey there may be a similar number of t dwarf companions in these relatively bright systems as compared to faint , isolated t dwarfs .",
    "such companions , based on the analysis above , can be reasonably well - characterized without the need of resolved imaging .",
    "there are many other variables that must be considered if the binary spectral template technique described here and in @xcite is to be used to determine accurate binary statistics for very low mass stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "component peculiarities , such as unusual surface gravities or cloud variations ; intrinsic scatter in absolute magnitude / spectral type relations ; magnetic- or weather - induced photometric variability ; the detailed properties of the still poorly - constrained l dwarf / t dwarf transition ; and the possible presence of tertiary components all contribute in constraining the variety of systems that can be identified from composite near - infrared spectroscopy . furthermore , because brown dwarfs cool over their lifetimes , the detectability of binaries based on component spectral types does not map uniquely to the detectability of binaries based on their mass ratios and ages , resulting in complex selection biases . these issues will be addressed in a future publication .",
    "we have found that subtle peculiarities observed in the near - infrared spectrum of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 , in particular a characteristic bowl - shaped dip at 1.6  @xmath1 , indicate the presence of a mid - type t dwarf companion .",
    "this companion is unresolved in lgs ao imaging observations ( including the first application of aperture mask interferometry with lgs ao ) , indicating a maximum projected separation of 8.3  au at the time of observations .",
    "the binary scenario not only provides a simple and straightforward explanation for the 1.6  @xmath1 feature  also present in the composite spectrum of the known m8.5 + t6 binary scr 1845@xmath06357but also resolves the discrepancy between the optical and near - infrared classifications of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 .",
    "furthermore , empirical binary templates composed of `` normal '' m dwarf plus t dwarf pairs provide a far superior match to the overall near - infrared spectral energy distribution of 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 than any single comparison source . the hypothesis that 2mass  j0320@xmath00446 is an unresolved binary is therefore compelling , and",
    "could potentially be verified through radial velocity monitoring observations . in addition , we estimate that roughly 1 - 5% of all late - type m dwarfs may harbor a mid - type t dwarf companion that could similarly be identified and characterized using low resolution near - infrared spectroscopy and binary spectral template analysis .",
