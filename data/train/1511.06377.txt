    "<S> we have investigated the time - dependent regime of a two - dimensional metamagnetic model at its tricritical point via monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , we obtained the temperature and magnetic field corresponding to the tricritical point of the model by using a refinement process based on optimization of the coefficient of determination in the log - log fit of magnetization decay as function of time . with these estimates in hand </S>",
    "<S> , we obtained the dynamic tricritical exponents @xmath0 and @xmath1 and the static tricritical exponents @xmath2 and @xmath3 by using the universal power - law scaling relations for the staggered magnetization and its moments at early stage of the dynamic evolution . our results at tricritical point confirm that this model belongs to the two - dimensional blume - capel model universality class for both static and dynamic behaviors , and also they corroborate the conjecture of janssen and oerding for the dynamics of tricritical points </S>",
    "<S> .    in the study of phase transitions and critical phenomena , systems which exhibit multicritical behavior have been the subject of a great number of works . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , the tricritical phase transition of the blume - capel @xcite model is one of the most studied . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are other models showing the existence of such multicritical points , for instance , the metamagnetic model @xcite , the blume - capel model with antiferromagnetic exchange interaction and external magnetic field added @xcite , and the random - field ising model @xcite . in order to investigate these phenomena , several techniques have been employed , including series expansions @xcite , linked - cluster expansion wang1984 , mean - field theory @xcite , renormalization group burkhardt1977,yeomans1981,bakchich1992,deoliveira1995 , transfer matrix @xcite , monte carlo simulations @xcite , and monte carlo renormalization group methods @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , the phase transitions of metamagnetic systems such as in the compound febr@xmath4 @xcite have also been studied in order to understand the tricritical behavior that appears as a consequence of a competition between the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic coupling constants present in this magnetic system .    </S>",
    "<S> the two - dimensional spin@xmath5 metamagnetic model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath6where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the spin variables . </S>",
    "<S> the considered model has two sublattices where the first sum extends over all nearest - neighbor pairs ( intersublattice ) and second one over all next - nearest neighbor pairs ( intrasublattice ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic coupling constants , respectively , and @xmath12 is the external magnetic field .    the order parameter of the model is the staggered magnetization , conveniently defined by @xmath13where @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the linear size of the square lattice . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath19 denote the magnetizations of the respective sublattices . </S>",
    "<S> this definition shows that there is an inversion of the meaning of ordered and disordered state . in order to obtain an ordered state </S>",
    "<S> , it is necessary to occupy the sites of the lattice with spins @xmath20 @xmath21 where the sum @xmath22 is odd ( even ) , or vice - versa . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the null magnetization may be obtained when all sites are occupied with the spins of the same kind .    on the contrary of the blume - capel model , </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram of the metamagnetic model has not yet been completely understood . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the controversial results between the experimental and theoretical works concerning the phase transitions of the system . </S>",
    "<S> if on the one hand , this model exhibits a rich phase diagram in the temperature - field plane with a line of second - order phase transitions , a line of first - order phase transitions and a tricritical point which is located at the point where the first and second order transition lines join each other with the same slope , one the other hand the mean - field theory @xcite predicts that such tricritical point depends on the value of the ratio between the coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> they only predicted the existence of a tricritical point for @xmath23 , while for @xmath24  in the mean field approximation the model exhibits two ising - like critical points : a critical endpoint corresponding to a point that ends at the first order line coming from the second order line and a double critical endpoint ( bicritical ) that corresponds to the terminal point of the first order transition line . </S>",
    "<S> although for the three - dimensional metamagnetic model herrmann et al . </S>",
    "<S> hermann1982 showed via monte carlo renormalization group that such critical endpoints exist , experimental works have not found those points in any real metamagnetic system , and also there is no evidence of such points for the two - dimensional metamagnetic systems as verified in different works ( see for example @xcite , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , santos e figueiredo @xcite by using master equation formalism on the context of dynamical pair aproximation , also in two dimensions , did not find any evidence for the decomposition of the tricritical point into the critical and bicritical end points as predicted by the mean field theory . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , other authors exclude the possibility of existence of these two critical endpoints even for three dimensions  geng et al . </S>",
    "<S> geng2008 , by using effective field theory , showed that there is no fourth - order critical point or reentrant phenomenon in the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> finally , other authors @xcite by performing mc simulations showed that there is no evidence of such a decomposition in a critical endpoint and a bicritical endpoint and such simulations produce a tricritical behaviour even for a coupling ratio as small as @xmath25 . *  *    although the previous estimates of the critical exponents for this model support the assertion that it belongs to the same universality class of the blume - capel model , the nonequilibrium critical behavior of this system has not been completely investigated up to date . </S>",
    "<S> santos and figueiredo santos2000 studied a similar layered metamagnetic model far from equilibrium by using short - time monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> they estimated the static critical exponents @xmath3 and @xmath2 and the dynamic critical exponent @xmath1 on the continuous transition line , but the tricritical exponents were not obtained . </S>",
    "<S> they also showed that although the critical exponent @xmath2 remains the same along the continuous transition line , the exponent @xmath3 departs from the expected value as we approach the tricritical point of the model .    </S>",
    "<S> the study of the dynamic critical properties of statistical systems has been a subject of considerable interest in non - equilibrium physics after the works by janssen , schaub and schmittmann @xcite , and huse huse1989 . by using , respectively </S>",
    "<S> , renormalization group techniques and numerical calculations , they showed that universality and scaling behavior are already present in systems since their early stages of the time evolution after quenching from high temperatures to the critical one . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the study of the critical properties of statistical systems became in some sense simpler , because they allow to circumvent the well - known problem of critical slowing down , characteristic of the long - time regime .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic scaling relation obtained by janssen _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ for the _ k_-th moment of the magnetization @xmath26 , extended to systems of finite size @xcite , is written as @xmath27where @xmath28 is the time , @xmath29 is an arbitrary spatial rescaling factor , @xmath30 is the reduced temperature and @xmath15 is the linear size of the lattice . </S>",

    "<S> one has : @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the separability of the variables @xmath48 and @xmath49 in @xmath50 leads to @xmath51 , where the prime means the derivative with respect to the argument . </S>",
    "<S> since the left - hand side of this equation depends only on @xmath49 and the right - hand side depends only on @xmath48 , they must be equal to a constant @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , resulting in @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> returning to the original variables , one has : @xmath56 .    </S>",
    "<S> on one hand , choosing @xmath57 and denoting @xmath58 , at criticality ( @xmath36 ) , we obtain the algebraically behavior of the magnetization , @xmath59    this can be observed by a finite time scaling @xmath60 , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( eq : main_short_time ) , at critical temperature ( @xmath36 ) , which leads to @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> defining @xmath62 , an expansion of the averaged magnetization around @xmath63 results in : @xmath64 . by construction @xmath65 , since @xmath66 and @xmath67 is a constant . discarding the quadratic terms we obtain the expected power law behavior @xmath68 , which is valid only for a characteristic time scale @xmath69 .    </S>",
    "<S> then , in this new universal regime , in addition to the familiar set of critical exponents described above , a new dynamic critical exponent @xmath0 is found . </S>",
    "<S> this exponent , independent of the previously known ones , characterizes the so called critical initial slip , the anomalous behavior of the magnetization when the system is quenched to the critical temperature @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a new critical exponent @xmath70 is introduced to describe the dependence of the scaling behavior on the initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> this exponent represents the anomalous dimension of the initial magnetization @xmath32 and is related to the exponent @xmath0 as @xmath71 .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the choice @xmath72 corresponds to the case which the system does not depend on the initial trace and in which @xmath73 leads to simple power law : @xmath74which corresponds to decay of magnetization at long times ( @xmath75 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> unlike the second - order phase transition , the behavior of a thermodynamic system is more complex at a tricritical point and the corresponding exponent @xmath0 may assume negative values . </S>",
    "<S> this assertion was theoretically deduced by janssen and oerding @xcite and numerically confirmed by da silva _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite through short - time monte carlo simulations at the tricritical point of the blume - capel model . </S>",
    "<S> however , as shown by some researchers , negative values of the exponent @xmath76 can be also found in systems exhibiting continuous phase transitions , as for instance , the baxter - wu @xcite , multispin @xcite , and 4-state potts models @xcite .    at a tricritical point , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization shows a crossover from the logarithmic behavior @xmath77^{-a}$ ] at short times @xmath78 to @xmath79 power law with logarithmic corrections , @xmath80^{-1/4}$ ] in three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the above behavior can be stated in the generalized form janssen1994 </S>",

    "<S> [ eq : magtricritical ] ) the function behave as @xmath83 or @xmath84 for vanishing and large arguments , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> below three dimensions it reduces to the scaling form given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( eq : theta ) , but now the exponent @xmath0 is the exponent related to the tricritical point of the relaxation process at early times .    in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> the simulations were carried out for square lattices with linear dimension @xmath85 and periodic boundary conditions for all performed experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the estimates for each exponent were obtained from five independent bins at the tricritical point , each one consisting of @xmath86 ( number of different time series of magnetization or its upper moments from an initial configuration ) runs and @xmath87 monte carlo sweeps . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars are fluctuations of the averages obtained from those bins and the dynamic evolution of the spins is local and updated by the heat - bath algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> here it is important to mention that finite size scaling effects are negligencible for the considered size @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , by using the eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ decay_ferro ] ) with @xmath88 runs and @xmath89 , we obtained @xmath90 form the time interval @xmath91 $ ] while for @xmath92 we obtained @xmath93 for the same interval and number of runs . </S>",
    "<S> so , within statistical errors we can not distinguish the results for @xmath89 and @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> then , we are very confortable with @xmath85 . other details about simulations will be supplied according to development of this manuscript .    in this paper , we performed time - dependent monte carlo ( mc ) simulations to explore the tricritical behavior of the two - dimensional metamagnetic model . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , we worked on localization of the tricritical point by using a recent refinement process developed by da silva et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . by considering as input the parameter @xmath95 , the supposed tricritical temperature @xmath96 , the resolution @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( a large number of runs is not required to these experiments since relaxation from ordered initial lattices are very stable , differently from evolutions from disordered initial states which demand a lot of runs ) </S>",
    "<S> , we performed mc simulations starting always from the ordered state ( @xmath73 ) in order to estimate the value of the external magnetic field @xmath100 at the tricritical point . with the tricritical set @xmath101 and @xmath100 in hand </S>",
    "<S> , we are then able to estimate some dynamic and static critical exponents of the proposed model .    to reach our goal , the time evolution of the magnetization ( eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( decay_ferro ) ) is obtained for each value of the external magnetic field @xmath102 in a range @xmath103 $ ] , where @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the @xmath100 is obtained by using the so - called determination coefficient of the fit    @xmath107    here , the closer to the unity is the coefficient , the better is the fit and the estimate of @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is simpler to calculate than other schemes , such as the goodness of fit , for example .    in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ determination_coefficient ] ) @xmath108 , @xmath109 , with @xmath110 denoting the magnetization of @xmath111-th run of @xmath28-th mc step , @xmath112 and @xmath29 are the linear coefficient and the slope in the linear fit @xmath113 versus @xmath114 , respectively . in our experiments </S>",
    "<S> we discarded the initial @xmath115 mc steps for better estimate . </S>",
    "<S> in previous work ( ref . </S>",
    "<S> dasilva2012,dasilva2013 ) we performed two successive refinements : one with larger @xmath116 and another more refined ( smaller ) @xmath117 . here </S>",
    "<S> since we have a good initial kick , we performed only one refinement with @xmath118 .    in the first attempt to obtain our set of tricritical parameters ( @xmath119 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we considered the results obtained by landau and swendsen @xcite , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , which were obtained through mc renormalization techniques . </S>",

    "<S> , width=384 ]    the best value corresponding to @xmath122 found by our refinement is @xmath128 which corroborates the value found in literature . </S>",
    "<S> since we have observed that our non - equilibrium method is able to determine the tricritical point , we can now use this estimate to check if , for instance , the exponent @xmath1 is consistent with the results of literature . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we used a function @xmath129 given by @xcite @xmath130where @xmath131 is the dimension of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this approach , that mixes moments of magnetization under different initial conditions , has proved to be very efficient in estimating the exponent @xmath1 for a great number of models dasilva2002,arashiro2003,fernandes2005,dasilva2005,dasilva2004a . </S>",
    "<S> here it is important to mention that the calculation of the second moment @xmath132 must be performed with initial magnetization per spin @xmath133 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the initial configuration of the system must be choosen at random instead of ordered one . as mentioned above , from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( eq : op ) , an initial ordered configuration ( @xmath134 for all sites ) gives @xmath135 and , although this is the simpler way , it is a very correlated one . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the sharp preparation of random initial condition with @xmath133 is also straightforward performed : we distribute randomly , and with same probability , spins @xmath20 and @xmath136 on the lattice sites . </S>",
    "<S> then , an adjustment process is performed : if the magnetization is negative , we choose randomly one site @xmath137 , and while the magnetization remains negative , we flip @xmath138 whether @xmath22 is odd and @xmath139 otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> if the magnetization is positive we make exactly  the opposite : we flip @xmath140 if @xmath22 is odd and @xmath138 otherwise . </S>",
