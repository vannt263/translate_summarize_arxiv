    "owing to the large amount of energy observed , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) were assumed to undergo a stage of fireballs which expand relativistically ( see , e.g. , goodman 1986 ; paczynski 1986 ) .",
    "relativistic bulk motion of the gamma - ray - emitting plasma would play a role in producing the observed phenomena of the sources ( krolik & pier 1991 ) .",
    "it was believed that the doppler effect over the whole fireball surface ( the so - called relativistic curvature effect ) might be the key factor to account for the observed spectrum of the events ( see , e.g. , meszaros & rees 1998 ; hailey et al .",
    "1999 ; qin 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "some simple bursts with well - separated structure suggest that they may consist of fundamental units of radiation such as pulses , with some of them being seen to comprise a fast rise and an exponential decay ( fred ) phases ( see , e.g. , fishman et al .",
    "these fred pulses could be well represented by flexible empirical or quasi - empirical functions ( see e.g. , norris et al .",
    "1996 ; kocevski et al . 2003 ) . fitting the corresponding light curves with the empirical functions ,",
    "many statistical properties of pulses were revealed .",
    "light curves of grb pulses were found to become narrower at higher energies ( fishman et al .",
    "1992 ; link , epstein , & priedhorsky 1993 ) .",
    "fenimore et al .",
    "( 1995 ) showed that the average pulse width is related with energy by a power law with an index of about @xmath2 .",
    "this was confirmed by later studies ( fenimore et al .",
    "1995 ; norris et al .",
    "1996 , 2000 ; costa 1998 ; piro et al . 1998",
    "; nemiroff 2000 ; feroci et al . 2001 ; crew et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in the past few years",
    ", many attempts of interpretation of light curves of grbs have been made ( see , e.g. , fenimore et al . 1996 ; norris et al .",
    "1996 ; norris et al .",
    "2000 ; ryde & petrosian 2002 ; kocevski et al . 2003 ) .",
    "it was suggested that the power law relationship could be attributed to synchrotron radiation ( see fenimore et al .",
    "1995 ; cohen et al .",
    "1997 ; piran 1999 ) .",
    "kazanas , titarchuk , & hua ( 1998 ) proposed that the relationship could be accounted for by synchrotron cooling ( see also chiang 1998 ; dermer 1998 ; and wang et al . 2000 ) .",
    "phenomena such as the hardness - intensity correlation and the fred form of pulses were recently interpreted as signatures of the relativistic curvature effect ( fenimore et al .",
    "1996 ; ryde & petrosian 2002 ; kocevski et al . 2003 ; qin et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "it was suspected that the power law relationship might result from a relative projected speed or a relative beaming angle ( nemiroff 2000 ) . due to the feature of self - similarity across energy bands observed ( see , e.g. , norris et al .",
    "1996 ) , it is likely that the observed difference between different channel light curves might mainly be due to the energy channels themselves .",
    "in other words , light curves of different energy channels might arise from the same mechanism ( e.g. , parameters of the rest frame spectrum and parameters of the expanding fireballs are the same for different energy ranges ) , differing only in the energy ranges involved .",
    "we believe that , if different channel light curves of a burst can be accounted for by the same mechanism where , except the energy ranges concerned , no parameters are allowed to be different for different energy channels , then the mechanism must be the main cause of the observed difference . a natural mechanism that possesses this property might be the doppler effect of the expanding fireball surface when a rest frame radiation form is assumed .",
    "indeed , as shown in paper i , the four channel light curves of grb 951019 were found to be well fitted by a single formula derived when this effect was taken into account . in paper i , the power law relationship between the pulse width and energy was interpreted as being mainly due to different active areas of the fireball surface corresponding to the majority of photons of these channels .",
    "however , how the width is related with energy remains unclear .",
    "presented in the following is a detailed analysis on this issue and based on it predictions on the relationship over a wide band covering those of batse and swift will be made .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we investigate in a general manner how the width and the ratio of the rising width to the decaying width of grb pulses are related with energy .",
    "then we make predictions on the relationship over the batse and swift bands for a typical hard and a typical soft bursts in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "a sample containing 28 fred pulse sources is employed to illustrate the relationship .",
    "a brief discussion and conclusions are presented in the last section .",
    "studies of the doppler effect of the expanding fireball surface were presented by different authors , and based on these studies formulas applicable to various situations are available ( see , e.g. , fenimore et al . 1996 ; granot et al .",

    "is one of them suitable for studying the issue concerned above , where a highly symmetric and expanding fireball is concerned .",
    "it can be verified that the expected flux of a fireball expanding with a lorentz factor @xmath3 can be determined by ( for a detailed derivation for this form of formula one can refer to paper i ) @xmath4 with @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the observation time measured by the distant observer , @xmath11 is the local time measured by the local observer located at the place encountering the expanding fireball surface at the position of @xmath12 relative to the center of the fireball , @xmath13 is the initial local time , @xmath14 is the radius of the fireball measured at @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the distance from the fireball to the observer , @xmath17 represents the development of the intensity measured by the local observer , and @xmath18 describes the rest frame radiation , and @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 being the upper and lower limits of @xmath24 confining @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "( note that , since the limit of the lorentz factor is @xmath3 , the formula can be applied to the cases of relativistic , sub - relativistic , and non - relativistic motions . )",

    "we first employ a local pulse to study the relationship in a much detail and later employ other local pulses to study the same issue in less details .",
    "the local pulse considered in this section is that of gaussian which is assumed to be @xmath30\\qquad \\qquad \\qquad ( \\tau _ { \\theta , \\min } \\leq \\tau _ \\theta ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are constants .",
    "as shown in paper i , there is a constraint to the lower limit of @xmath35 , which is @xmath36 .",
    "due to this constraint , it is impossible to take a negative infinity value of @xmath37 and therefore the interval between @xmath33 and @xmath38 must be limited .",
    "here we assign @xmath39 so that the interval between @xmath33 and @xmath37 would be large enough to make the rising part of the local pulse close to that of the gaussian pulse .",
    "the @xmath40 of the gaussian pulse is @xmath41 , which leads to @xmath42 . in the following , we assign @xmath43 , and take @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , and adopt @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "here we employ the band function ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) with typical indexes @xmath51 and @xmath52 as the rest frame radiation form to investigate how the @xmath1 and the @xmath53/@xmath54 are related with the corresponding energy , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the @xmath1 in the rising and decaying phases of the light curve , respectively .",

    "displayed in figs .",
    "1a and 1b are the @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xmath56 curves , respectively .",
    "one finds from these curves that , for all sets of the parameters adopted here , a semi - power law relationship between each of the two quantities ( @xmath1 and @xmath53/@xmath54 ) and @xmath56 could be observed within a range ( called the power law range ) spanning over more than 1 order of magnitudes of frequency . beyond this range ( i.e. , in higher and lower frequency bands )",
    ", both the @xmath1 and @xmath57 of the observed light curve would remain unchanged with frequency .",
    "we call the unchanged section of the curves in lower frequency band relative to the power law range a lower band platform and call that in higher frequency band a higher band platform . for a certain rest frame spectrum ( say , when the value of @xmath58 is fixed ) , the power law range shifts to higher energy bands when @xmath59 becomes larger",
    ". the power law range could therefore become an indicator of the lorentz factor as long as @xmath58 is fixed ( in practice , as @xmath58 is always unclear , what can be determined is the product @xmath60 which is directly associated with the observed peak energy @xmath61 ; see what discussed below ) .",
    "the power law range shown in a @xmath55 @xmath56 curve is marked by a smooth turning at its lower energy end and a sharp turning at its higher end .",
    "let @xmath62 ( or @xmath63 ) denote the position of the turning at the lower energy end and @xmath64 ( or @xmath65 ) represent that at the higher end .",
    "one finds that @xmath66 would be well defined due to the sharp feature associated with it while @xmath62 would not since the corresponding feature is smooth . according to fig .",
    "1a , we simply define @xmath62 by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the minimum and maximum values of the @xmath1 of the light curves .",
    "listed in table 1 are the values of @xmath62 and @xmath70 as well as @xmath68 and @xmath69 deduced from the curves of fig .",
    "one can conclude from this table that @xmath71 for all the adopted lorentz factors ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) , and @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , for @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "it reveals that @xmath70 is proportional to @xmath75 .",
    "for the same value of @xmath75 , @xmath70 would be independent of @xmath59 or @xmath58 .",
    "the power law range spans over more than 1 order of magnitudes of frequency for all the lorentz factors concerned .",
    "in addition , we find that , for the same value of @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "as shown in qin ( 2002 ) , when taking into account the doppler effect of fireballs , the observed peak frequency would be related with the peak frequency of the typical rest frame band function spectrum by @xmath79 , i.e. , @xmath80 . in terms of @xmath81",
    ", we get from table 1 that @xmath82 and @xmath83 .    in the same way",

    "it also shows that , although both @xmath64 and @xmath62 are proportional to @xmath75 , they are independent of @xmath59 or @xmath58 alone . in terms of @xmath81 , we get @xmath93 and @xmath94 . in addition , we find that , for the same value of @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath78 . suggested by table 2 , the values of @xmath97 and @xmath98 rely only on the local pulse width @xmath76 .    the relation between @xmath63 and @xmath81 or that between @xmath65 and @xmath99 suggests that once we obtain the value of @xmath63 or @xmath65 in the case of the typical rest frame band function spectrum , we would be able to estimate @xmath99 , or vice versa .",
    "it is noticed that a certain value of @xmath56 might correspond to different energies associated with different values of @xmath100 .",
    "let us assign @xmath101 when taking @xmath48 , @xmath102 when taking @xmath103 , and @xmath104 when taking @xmath105 .",
    "in this situation , @xmath106 holds for all these cases . presented in fig .",
    "1c are the curves of fig .",
    "1a in terms of energy , where the power law range confined by @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( see table 1 ) is displayed . shown in fig .",

    "when @xmath75 being the same ( here , @xmath111 ) , the two relationships ( one is that between @xmath1 and energy , and the other is that between @xmath57 and energy ) are independent of the lorentz factor , and the power law ranges of the curves arising from @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 become almost the same .",
    "one can conclude from this analysis that , in the case of adopting the typical band function with @xmath51 and @xmath52 as the rest frame radiation form , there exists a semi - power law relationship spanning over more than one order of magnitudes of energy , between the width of pulses and energy as well as between the ratio of the rising width to the decaying width of pulses and energy .",
    "the upper and lower limits of this power law range are well related with the observed peak energy @xmath0 of a fireball source .",
    "adopted as the rest frame radiation form , let us consider two other spectra which are much different from the band function ( especially in the high energy band ) .",
    "one is the thermal synchrotron spectrum : @xmath112 $ ] , where @xmath113 is a constant including all constants in the exponential index ( liang et al .",
    "the other is the comptonized spectrum : @xmath114 , where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are constants .",
    "typical value @xmath117 ( schaefer et al . 1994 ) for the index of the comptonized radiation will be adopted .",

    "2a and 2b are the @xmath1  @xmath118 and @xmath119  @xmath118 curves , respectively , corresponding to the rest frame thermal synchrotron spectrum and local gaussian pulse ( 3 ) .",
    "a semi - power law relationship could also be observed in both plots . in the case of @xmath120 ( where the turn over could be well defined in the two plots )",
    "we get from fig . 2a that @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath122 , for @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively , and @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 , for @xmath48 , @xmath126 and @xmath50 , respectively , and obtain from fig . 2b that @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , for @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath130 , respectively , and @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , for @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "it suggests that , in the case of the rest frame thermal synchrotron spectrum , @xmath134 is proportional to @xmath135 , and the power law range can span over more than 5 orders of magnitudes of frequency .",
    "shown in figs .",
    "2c and 2d are the @xmath1  @xmath56 and @xmath119  @xmath56 curves , respectively , associated with the rest frame comptonized spectrum and arising from local gaussian pulse ( 3 ) .",
    "a semi - power law relationship could also be detected in both plots . in the case of @xmath136",
    "we deduce from fig .",
    "2c that @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , for @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively , and @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , for @xmath48 , @xmath126 and @xmath50 , respectively , and find from fig . 2d that @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 , for @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively , and @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 , for @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively . in the case of the rest frame comptonized spectrum , @xmath70 is proportional to @xmath149 .",
    "the power law range spans over more than 2 orders of magnitudes of frequency .",
    "it could be concluded that , in the case of adopting a rest frame spectrum with an exponential tail in the high energy band , a semi - power law relationship between the @xmath1 and energy or between @xmath119 and energy could also be observed .",
    "the range ( spanning over more than 2 orders of magnitudes of energy ) would be much larger than that in the case of the band function .",
    "it seems common that , for a rest frame spectrum , there exists a power law relationship between each of the @xmath1 and @xmath150 and energy within an energy range .",
    "the range is very sensitive to the rest frame spectrum and the product of the rest frame peak energy and the lorentz factor .",
    "it has been known that indexes of spectra of many grbs are observed to vary with time ( see preece et al .",
    "we are curious how the relationship would be if the rest frame spectrum develops with time . here , corresponding to the soft - to - hard phenomenon , let us consider a simple case where the rest frame spectrum is a band function with its indexes and the peak frequency decreasing with time .",
    "we assume a simple evolution of indexes @xmath151 and @xmath152 and peak frequency @xmath153 which follow @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 , for @xmath157 . for @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 , while for @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "we take @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath46 respectively ( they correspond to different speeds of decreasing ) and adopt @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 respectively in the following analysis .",
    "let us employ local gaussian pulse ( 3 ) with @xmath168 to study the relationship .",
    "we adopt @xmath169 and @xmath170 and once more assign @xmath171 and @xmath172 ( see what mentioned above ) . displayed in fig .",
    "3 are the expected @xmath1  @xmath173 and @xmath57  @xmath173 curves , where the frequency is presented in units of @xmath174 which is the largest value of @xmath153 adopted .",
    "we find that , when the decreasing speed becomes larger ( say , @xmath175 or @xmath46 ) , the relationships would obviously betray what noticed above .",
    "in this situation , the relationship between the pulse width and energy could show at least two semi - power law ranges with the index of that in the lower energy band being positive , and therefore a peak value of the width marking the two lower energy power law ranges would be observed .",
    "accordingly , the lower band platform noticed above disappears . in the case of the relationship between @xmath57 and @xmath176 , a peak of @xmath57 marking",
    "two higher energy semi - power law ranges could also be detected .",
    "this peaked feature is a remarkable signature of the evolution of the rest frame spectrum .",
    "here we investigate if different local pulses would lead to a much different result .",
    "three forms of local power law pulses are considered .",
    "we choose power law forms instead of other local pulse forms due to the fact that different values of the power law index would correspond to entirely different forms of local pulses .",
    "the first is the local pulse with a power law rise and a power law decay , which is assumed to be @xmath177 where @xmath31 , @xmath178 , @xmath37 , @xmath33 and @xmath179 are constants .",
    "the peak of this intensity is at @xmath33 , and the two @xmath1 positions of this intensity before and after @xmath33 are @xmath180 and @xmath181 , respectively . in the case of @xmath182 ,",
    "the @xmath1 of this local pulse is @xmath183 , which leads to @xmath184 .",
    "the second is the local pulse with a power law rise which is written as @xmath185 the peak of this intensity is at @xmath179 . in the case of @xmath186 , the relation of @xmath184 holds .",
    "the third is the local pulse with a power law decay which follows @xmath187 the peak of this intensity is at @xmath37 . in the case of @xmath186 ,",
    "the relation of @xmath184 holds as well .",
    "we assign @xmath43 and @xmath182 and take @xmath188 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 , to study the width of light curves arising from these forms of local pulses . for local pulse ( 4 ) , we adopt @xmath189 .",
    "we find in the @xmath1  @xmath56 and @xmath57  @xmath56 plots ( which are omitted due to the similarity to fig .",
    "1 ) associated with local pulse ( 4 ) that a semi - power law relationship between each of the two pulse width quantities and frequency could also be observed for all sets of the adopted parameters .",
    "the power law range of frequency is quite similar to that in the case of the local gaussian pulse .",
    "the only significant differences are : a ) the magnitude of the width of the expected light curve is much smaller than that in the case of the local gaussian pulse if the local pulse width is sufficiently large ( when the local pulse width is small enough , the observed width of the light curve would differ slightly ) ; b ) the magnitude of the ratio of widthes of the corresponding light curve is much larger than that in the case of the local gaussian pulse , regardless how large is the local pulse width . from the @xmath1  @xmath56 curves we find that for all the adopted values of the lorentz factor ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) , @xmath190 ; and for @xmath191 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 , respectively . from the @xmath57",

    "the values of @xmath85 and @xmath98 rely only on the local pulse width @xmath76 , being independent of the lorentz factor .",

    "in addition , we find that local pulse forms affect only the magnitude of the width and the ratio of widthes .",
    "we perform predictions on the relationships for a typical hard burst with @xmath227 and a typical soft burst with @xmath303 .",
    "the analysis shows that , generally , for the typical hard burst the power range would be observed in the batse band while for the typical soft burst the power law range would shift to the swift band . in some particular cases",
    "( e.g. , when the rest frame thermal synchrotron spectrum is adopted ) , the power law range could cover the batse as well as swift bands for both typical bursts .",
    "a sample of 28 grbs is employed to study the relationship .",
    "we find that , except # 5541 , sources of the sample either exhibit the platform - power - law - platform feature ( including 17 bursts ) or show the peaked feature ( including 10 bursts ) .",
    "it suggests that , for most sources of this sample , the doppler effect of fireballs could indeed account for the observed relationship . as for # 5541 , we wonder if other kinds of rest frame spectral evolution such as a soft - to - hard - to - soft manner instead of the simple decreasing pattern could lead to its specific feature ( it will deserve an investigation later ) . since the peaked feature is a signature of the development of the rest frame spectrum , we suspect that the 10 sources with the peaked feature might undergo an obvious evolution of radiation , while for the other 17 bursts , the development , if it exists , might be very mild .    in the above analysis",
    ", we consider the evolution of three parameters , the lower and higher energy indexes and the peak energy , of the rest frame band function spectrum .",
    "we wonder what a role each of the three factors would play in producing the peaked feature shown above . here",
    "we study once more the case of the simple evolution of indexes @xmath151 and @xmath152 and peak frequency @xmath153 considered in section 2.3 , but in three different patterns .",
    "they are as follows : a ) @xmath304 for @xmath305 , and @xmath159 for @xmath306 , and @xmath307 for @xmath308 , and @xmath160 and @xmath309 ; b ) @xmath310 for @xmath311 , and @xmath160 for @xmath312 , and @xmath313 for @xmath314 , and @xmath159 and @xmath309 ; c ) @xmath315 for @xmath316 , and @xmath309 for @xmath317 , and @xmath318 for @xmath162 , and @xmath159 and @xmath160 . the first pattern is associated with the evolution of the lower energy index , the second reflects nothing but the evolution of the higher energy index , and the third connects with the evolution of the peak energy , of the rest frame band function spectrum , where , for each of the three cases , the other two parameters are fixed .",
    "in the same way we employ local gaussian pulse ( 3 ) with @xmath250 to study the relationship .",
    "we adopt @xmath319 , @xmath169 and @xmath170 , and assign @xmath39 and @xmath320 . displayed in fig .",
    "8 are the corresponding @xmath1  @xmath321 and @xmath57  @xmath173 curves , where @xmath174 is the largest value of @xmath153 adopted .",
    "one finds from fig . 8 that the peaked feature shown in the relationship between the width and energy ( see fig .",
    "3 ) is mainly due to the evolution of the lower energy index of the rest frame band function spectrum , while that shown in the relationship between the ratio of pulse widths and energy arises from the evolution of the higher energy index .",
    "it is interesting that no contribution from the evolution of the peak energy of the rest frame band function spectrum to the features could be detected ( probably the evolution of the peak energy considered here is too mild to produce an interesting feature ) .",
    "as mentioned above , it was proposed by many authors that the power law relationship observed in grb pulses could arise from synchrotron radiation ( see section 1 ) .",
    "a simple synchrotron cooling scenario is : as the electrons cool , their average energy becomes smaller , which causes the emission peaks at lower energy at later time ( see kazanas et al .",
    "recently , a power law relationship between the total isotropic energy and @xmath0 was revealed ( lloyd et al . 2000 ; amati et al .",
    "it was suggested that this power law relation could be expected in the case of an optically thin synchrotron shock model for a power law distribution of electrons ( see lloyd et al .",
    "these considerations lead to a softening picture of the rest frame spectrum .",
    "does the proposal of synchrotron radiation conflict with the effect discussed above ? to find an answer to this , it might be helpful to remind that the doppler effect of fireballs is only a kinetic effect while that of synchrotron radiation is a dynamic one .",
    "therefore , there is no confliction between the two .",
    "as analyzed in section 2.3 , a softening of the rest frame spectrum coupling with the doppler effect of fireballs would lead to a peaked feature in the relationship between the pulse width and energy if the speed of the softening is fast enough .",
    "the observed data of our sample ( see fig .",
    "7 ) show that this is indeed the case for some events ( at least for some fred pulse grbs ) .",
    "we are wondering if the softening of the rest frame spectrum could lead to a much different value of the power law index .",
    "we thus analyze the power law ranges in the upper panels of fig . 3 and find that the index would be confined within @xmath258  @xmath252 , which is not much different from what obtained above .",
    "we know that light curves of most bursts are complex and do not consists of single pulses .",
    "it was pointed out that superposition of many pulses could create the observed diversity and complexity of grb light curves ( fishman et al . 1994 ; norris et al .",
