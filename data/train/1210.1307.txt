    "quarks and gluons are basic ingredients of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . at low temperature and density , the quarks and gluons are confined in colorless composites , the hadrons . however , at high temperature and/or high density , the quarks and gluons are de - confined and become active degrees of freedom .",
    "hence , for the discussion of strongly interacting matter in various situations , we ought to describe the dynamics of quarks and gluons and at the same time baryons and mesons in order to delineate the corresponding phases .",
    "lattice qcd ( lqcd ) simulations can handle strongly interacting matter at finite temperature and at very small baryon chemical potential . as a consequence of the sign problem in lqcd ,",
    "it is extremely difficult , however , to deal with the qcd quark - gluon matter at finite density covering broad ranges of real baryon chemical potential .",
    "the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite is often used as an alternative , schematic approach to strongly interacting matter  @xcite , based on chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking .",
    "the njl model is further generalized by introducing the polyakov loop to account for important thermodynamical aspects of color confinement  @xcite .",
    "this pnjl model is by now widely used for the discussion of quark - hadron matter at finite temperature and density  @xcite .",
    "the pnjl model results can be compared directly with lattice qcd at finite temperature and zero baryon density .",
    "there is , however , a basic conceptual problem when applying the pnjl model at finite baryon density : color - singlet baryon formation is not accounted for . while color - nonsinglet degrees of freedom are suppressed in the `` baryonic '' phase by the polyakov loop , three quarks coupled to a color - singlet are still delocalized and spread over all space instead of being confined in localized baryonic clusters .    in this context",
    "it is instructive to study the simpler case of two - color qcd . with the gauge group @xmath2 , the corresponding lattice qcd approach",
    "does not have the sign problem , and lqcd simulations can be performed at any baryon chemical potential @xmath3 .",

    "baryons are diquarks ,",
    "_ i.e. _ spin singlet or triplet bosons in this theory .",
    "the resulting physics is qualitatively different from `` real '' qcd with @xmath5 . nonetheless ,",
    "exploring the @xmath6 theory and designing ( p)njl type models in which both mesons ( quark - antiquark modes ) and baryons ( diquarks ) emerge as active hadronic degrees of freedom , can teach important lessons about the thermodynamics and the phase structure of strongly interacting quark - hadron matter at non - zero baryon chemical potential .",
    "several lqcd studies for color @xmath0 are available  @xcite and provide equations of state and hadron masses of two - color quark - hadron matter at both finite temperature and density .",
    "it is then an interesting question to what extent these lqcd results can be understood and interpreted in terms of models , such as the pnjl approach , in order to identify leading mechanisms and basic symmetry breaking patterns .",
    "our work is aimed in that direction .",
    "it presents major steps beyond a previous njl model calculation  @xcite performed in a similar context , and it complements other related two - color qcd studies  @xcite .    in this paper , we study the color @xmath0 njl model using bosonization and renormalization techniques to construct the meson and diquark - baryon effective lagrangian .",
    "the derivation of the complete hadron lagrangian follows the eguchi method @xcite and renormalization lead to a generalized linear @xmath1 model with pauli - grsey symmetry .",
    "the partition function and the thermodynamical potential are derived with and without incorporation of polyakov loop effects .",
    "the equation of state is deduced and the phase diagram is studied in detail .",
    "we investigate the excitation spectrum of quark - hadron matter at various temperatures and densities .",
    "we then include the effect of hadrons in the thermodynamical potential and calculate the pressure and the quark density using the gaussian approximation  @xcite of the hadron lagrangian , taking only the mass terms into account .",

    "is introduced , bosonization is performed and an extended linear @xmath1 model is derived .",
