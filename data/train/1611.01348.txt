    "a possible new kind of exotic nuclear matter called _ mesic nucleus _ consists of a nucleus bound via the strong interaction with a neutral meson such as the @xmath1 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 or @xmath17 meson .",

    "therefore in this article we present results of the analysis optimised for the search of the states with the width ranging from 5 to 50  mev .",
    "moreover , the theories predict @xmath1-nucleus bound states widths which are larger than the binding energies  @xcite .",
    "even though many experimental searches have been carried out until now @xcite , none of them have brought forth a clear evidence for the existence of such bound states .",
    "the discovery of mesonic bound states would enable us to broaden the knowledge of the elementary meson - nucleon interaction in the nuclear medium at low energies .",
    "moreover , it would provide information about the properties of the @xmath1 meson @xcite as well as the @xmath20 resonance  @xcite inside a nuclear medium .",

    "<S> the search for @xmath0-@xmath1 bound states was performed with the wasa - at - cosy facility via the measurement of the excitation function for the @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath2 @xmath4 processes . </S>",
    "<S> the deuteron beam momentum was varied continuously between 2.127  gev / c and 2.422  gev / c , corresponding to the excess energy for the @xmath2 @xmath5 reaction ranging from @xmath6 -70  mev to @xmath6 30  mev . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity was determined based on the @xmath2 @xmath7 reaction and the quasi - free proton - proton scattering via @xmath2 @xmath8 reactions . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation functions , determined independently for the measured reactions , do not reveal a structure which could be interpreted as a narrow mesic nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the upper limits of the total cross sections for the bound state production and decay in @xmath9-@xmath10 @xmath3 and @xmath9-@xmath10 @xmath4 processes were determined taking into account the isospin relation between the both of the considered channels . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the analysis depend on the assumptions of the @xmath11(1535 ) momentum distribution in the anticipated mesic-@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> assuming , as in the previous works , that this is identical with the distribution of nucleons bound with 20  mev in @xmath0 , we determined that ( for the mesic bound state width in the range from 5 mev to 50 mev ) the upper limits at 90% confidence level are about 3  nb and about 6  nb for @xmath12 and @xmath13 channels , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> however , based on the recent theoretical findings of the @xmath11(1535 ) momentum distribution in the @xmath11-@xmath14 nucleus bound by 3.6 mev , we find that the wasa - at - cosy detector acceptance decreases and hence the corresponding upper limits are 5  nb and 10  nb for @xmath12 and @xmath13 channels respectively .    </S>",
