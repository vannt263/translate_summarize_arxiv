    "in contrast , for each real value of @xmath113 one always finds real values of @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , the transport in @xmath49-direction is not affected by the formation of the pseudo - gaps , and depends only on the details of scattering at the metal - graphene interfaces .",
    "the latter effect is , however , weak and falls beyond the scope of our consideration .",
    "we therefore conclude that one - dimensional superlattices have a major impact only on the transport properties along the direction of their periodicity .",
    "the dirac - kronig - penney model has been applied in order to study phase - coherent charge transport in periodically strained graphene samples . using the exact relations for the band - structure in the considered superlattice",

    "the exact quantities are simplified in the thermodynamic limit by neglecting the contribution of evanescent modes and averaging over the fabry - p ' erot oscillations .",
    "the conductance is found to be suppressed at energies corresponding to the positions of the pseudo - gaps in the modified spectra of the superlattice .",
    "the periodic strain and electrostatic potentials are argued to have the largest effect on transport in the direction perpendicular to the equipotential lines .",
    "the vector potentials are shown to play a greater role in confining the dirac quasi - particles due to the suppression of klein tunnelling .",

    "to do so , we generalize the standard methods of elementary band structure theory to the dirac case with its non - trivial matrix structure . we find that for purely scalar potentials , this additional structure prevents the creation of a gap at @xmath219 thus making @xmath220 and @xmath221 more relevant for the transport properties ; this fact can be related to the chirality of the quasi - particles in graphene and the phenomenon of klein tunnelling .",
