    "blazars are an intriguing class of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , dominated by non - thermal radiation over the entire electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "their emission extends from radio to tev energies with a broad band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) typically described by two main components , the first peaking from ir to x - ray bands while the second often dominating the @xmath0-ray energy range in which blazars are the most commonly detected extragalactic sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    the distinguishing observational properties of blazars also include flat radio spectra , high observed luminosity coupled with rapid variability at all frequencies and highly variable radio to optical polarization . in particular , they are a dominant class of extragalactic sources at radio , microwave and @xmath0-ray frequencies where thermal emission processes do not produce significant amounts of radiation @xcite . adopting the blazar classification scheme given in the roma - bzcat catalog[multiblock footnote omitted ]",
    "@xcite , based on the width of optical spectral lines , blazars usually come in two flavors : the bl lac objects and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , with the latter more or less equivalent to the former population except for stronger emission lines , higher radio to optical polarization and higher redshift .",
    "in addition , the high energy component of blazars sed is usually found in the gev band for fsrqs , while it can extend to tev energy for bl lacs .",
    "hereinafter , we adopt the naming convention of the roma - bzcat catalog , referring to bl lacs as bzbs and to the fsrqs as bzqs .",
    "these extreme features have been interpreted as radiation arising from a relativistic jet closely aligned to the line of sight and emitting continuous , doppler - boosted spectra @xcite . for both classes of blazars , according to the widely accepted synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) scenario , the low energy component is produced by inverse synchrotron emission from highly relativistic electrons , while the high energy bump can be attributed to inverse compton scattering of synchrotron photons by the same population of relativistic electrons that produce the synchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "a different theoretical interpretation of the high energy @xmath0-ray bump characteristic of the bzq broad band emission invokes the inverse compton emission of seed photons arising from regions external to the jet ( e.g. , the broad line region , accretion disk ) as emission mechanism for such feature of the sed .",
    "this model is known as the external compton scenario ( ec ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , we showed that in the [ 3.4]-[4.6]-[12 ] @xmath1 m color - color diagram the blazars , which are dominated by non - thermal emission mechanism , cover a distinct region ( hereinafter the _ wise blazar strip _ , wbs ) , well separated from the locus of other extragalactic sources which are dominated by the contribution of thermal radiation@xcite .",
    "this result has been obtained using the blazars listed in the roma - bzcat catalog . in the ir",
    ", we used data from wise @xcite .",
    "the _ wise _  mission observed the sky at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22 @xmath1 m in 2010 with an angular resolution of 6.1@xmath2 , 6.4@xmath2 , 6.5@xmath2 & 12.0@xmath2 in the four bands , achieving 5@xmath3 point source sensitivities of 0.08 , 0.11 , 1 and 6 mjy in unconfused regions on the ecliptic , respectively @xcite .",
    "the astrometric accuracy of _ wise _  is @xmath4 , and 1.4@xmath2 for the four _ wise _  bands , respectively @xcite .",
    "a previous attempt to compare the infrared behavior of blazars with normal galaxies in the j - h - k color - color diagram was performed using the 2mass archival data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , our new approach has three advantages over the study performed using 2mass : 1 ) mid - ir selection is dominated by dusty objects , in particular spiral and starburst galaxies ; 2 ) the blazars population covers a noticeably narrow region in the [ 3.4]-[4.6]-[12 ] @xmath1 m color - color plot that is clearly statistically separated them from the locus dominated by other extragalactic sources @xcite ; 3 ) _ wise _  covers a much larger interval of frequencies and reaches to larger wavelengths than 2mass , yielding a color - color distribution where stars occupy a narrow and well defined locus .    the _ fermi _  large area telescope ( lat ) collaboration has recently released the _ fermi _  lat second source catalog ( 2fgl ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) including about 800 @xmath0-ray sources associated with blazars to a high level of confidence ; 571 of these blazars are also present in the roma - bzcat . in this paper",
    "we investigate how the infrared emission of blazars is related to their high energy @xmath0-ray radiation , by cross - matching the sample of roma - bzcat blazars associated with _",
    "sources with the _ wise _  data archive @xcite . in section",

    "we show how the _ fermi _  detected blazars lie on the _ wise blazar strip _  and we determine the distributions of their ir colors .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : correlation ] , we investigate a possible relation between the blazar ir and @xmath0-ray emissions , as predicted in the ssc and ec radiative scenarios . in section  [ sec : cd ] we estimate the compton dominance ( cd ) parameter for both the bzqs and the bzbs and we also examine the apparent correlation between the cd and the @xmath0 -ray spectral index for bzbs . in section  [ sec : bllacs ] we focus our analysis on the bl lac population and its subclasses .",
    "finally , our summary and discussion are given in section  [ sec : summary ] .    throughout this paper , we assume that the spectral indices @xmath5 , are defined by flux density , @xmath6 . unless otherwise stated , we use cgs units .",
    "we considered all the blazars in the roma - bzcat that have been associated with a _ fermi _  source , as reported in the 2fgl @xcite , for a total number of 571 sources ( i.e. , 330 bzbs and 241 bzqs ) .",
    "the second edition of the roma - bzcat catalog @xcite assembles blazars known in the literature and carefully verified by inspection of their multiwavelength emission .",
    "members of the roma - bzcat catalog are selected on the basis of a set of criteria involving the presence of detection in the radio band down to 1 mjy flux density at 1.4 ghz * ( 2.1 @xmath7 ) * , the optical identification and availability of an optical spectrum for further spectral classification , and the detection of x - ray luminosity @xmath8 ergs@xmath9 .",
    "such criteria do not produce a statistically homogeneous neither complete sample of blazars because of the spatially uneven distribution and the variable depths of observations available , but provides the largest and more carefully selected sample of confirmed blazars available to date",
    ". the selection and spectral classification of blazars can be difficult due to the absence of typical spectral emission features and to the variability of the emission on timescales of a day or even few hours . in the roma - bzcat",
    ", blazars are also classified in three classes , based on prominence of the emission features in the optical spectra of these sources .",
    "the three classes of such classification are : bzb for the bl lac sources , i.e. agns with featureless optical spectra and narrow emission lines ; bzq for flat - spectrum radio quasars with optical spectra showing broad emission lines and typical blazars behavior ; bzu for blazars of uncertain type , associated to sources with peculiar characteristics but also showing typical traits of the blazars .",
    "this spectral classification will be used throughout this paper .",
    "the distinction between bzb and bzq depends on the choice of an arbitrary threshold value of the equivalent width of the emission lines in the optical spectra of the sources .",
    "the 2flg catalog contains primarily unresolved sources detected in the all - sky fermi observations obtained throughout the second year of operation .",
    "the sources , after detection and the localization in the sky , are assigned an integrated flux in the 100 mev to 100 gev energy range , a spectral shape and a significance parameter _ ts _",
    "based on how significantly each source emerges from the background . only sources with _",
    "ts @xmath10 25 _ , corresponding to a significance of @xmath11 , have been included in the catalog .",
    "each of the 1873 2flg sources have been considered for identification with already known astronomical sources available in literature multi - wavelength observations @xcite . for 127 of the 2flg sources",
    "firm identifications have been produced ( namely , reliable identifications based on synchronous periodic variability of the sources , coincident spatial morphologies for extended sources or correlated aperiodic variability ) .",
    "the remaining sources have been investigated for association with sources contained in a list of source catalogs based on different multi - wavelength observations .",
    "the roma - bzcat catalog is one of the catalogs used for the association of the 2flg sources , and 571 _ fermi _  sources have been associated to a bzcat - roma blazar .",
    "we selected all blazars in the roma - bzcat reliably associated to a @xmath0-ray source of the 2fgl catalog .",
    "then , using the more accurate radio position of the roma - bzcat in place of the coordinates from the _ fermi _  catalog , we searched for infrared counterparts of the above blazars in the _ wise _  archive .",
    "the total number of roma - bzcat blazars in the 2fgl footprint falling in the area surveyed by _ wise _  during the first year ( corresponding to 57% of the whole sky ) is 332 ( mostly due to the incompleteness of the sky coverage of the roma - bzcat ) . in order to search for the positional coincidences of blazars in the observed _ wise _  sky , we considered a search radius 2.4@xmath2 , obtained by combining the 1@xmath2 error assumed for the radio position reported in the roma - bzcat @xcite with the error on the fourth _ wise _  band at 22@xmath1 m ( i.e. , 1.4@xmath2 ) ( see also",

    "this gives rise to the distinction between the _  low \" -  intermediate \" -  high \" synchrotron peaked _ non - thermal sources ( lsps , isps , hsps ) , whenever the peak of the synchrotron component lies below 10@xmath49hz * ( @xmath50 ) * , between 10@xmath49hz and 10@xmath51hz * ( @xmath52 ) * , or higher than 10@xmath51hz , respectively @xcite .",
    "even if blazars should most appropriately be classified on the basis of a complete sed , built with simultaneous data , this is not possible in the majority of the cases , but lsp or hsp bl lac objects can still be identified by using radio - optical - x - ray spectral indices @xcite . the frequency of the synchrotron peak is estimated using the broadband spectral indices between radio and optical wavelengths ( @xmath53 ) and the optical and x - ray wavelengths ( @xmath54 ) and extrapolating the spectral shape of bl lacs to infrared frequency , where the peak is expected to be located according to accepted bl lacs sed model .",

    "the three bl lac subclasses of hsps ( green points ) , lsp ( black points ) and isps ( yellow points ) are shown .",
    "( see section  [ sec : bllacs ] for more details).,width=321,height=234 ]    in this paper we adopt the sed classification criterion for the bl lacs for the _ fermi _  - _ wise _  blazars sample distinguishing hsps , isps and lsps according to the 2lac sample @xcite .",
    "for these three families of bl lacs we studied the relation between the two spectral indices @xmath48-@xmath35 .",
    "we notice that , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectralindexirspectralindexgamma_classed ] , there is a clear distinction between the two classes in the @xmath48 , however it is more evident in the @xmath35 distribution ( a 94% level of significance has been obtained with a ks test ) .",
    "a similar distinction between bl lacs subclasses is visible in the color - magnitude plot produced using the [ 3.4]-[4.6 ] @xmath1 m color and the [ 3.4 ] @xmath1 m magnitude in fig .",
    "[ fig : color1mag1_classed ] in the appendix ( section  [ sec : appendix ] ) .",
    "the three families have clearly separated color distributions , with hsps , isps and lsps with average values of the [ 3.4]-[4.6 ] @xmath1 m color 0.72 , 0.94 and 1.02 respectively .",
    "finally , we calculate the correlation coefficient between the variables @xmath48 and @xmath35 , finding @xmath44 ( p - value negligible ) , implying that the two variables are correlated within a high level of significance . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdvspectralindexgamma_classed ] , the three different bl lacs classes in the cd vs @xmath55 plane are shown . in this case , the cd distributions of the hsps and lsps are similar ( at a 70% level of confidence , obtained with a ks test ) , while , for the isps and the hsps , the null hypothesis can be rejected to a 87% level of significance .",
    "we have presented the infrared characterization of a sample of blazars detected in the @xmath0-ray . in order to perform our selection , we considered all the blazars in the roma - bzcat catalog @xcite that are associated with a @xmath0-ray source in the 2fgl @xcite .",
    "then , we searched for infrared counterparts in the _ wise_archive adopting the same criteria described in @xcite ( see also section  [ sec : sample ] for more details ) .",
    "the 296 _ wise _  counterparts of the roma - bzcat - _ fermi _  blazars constitute our sample ( i.e. the _ fermi _  - _ wise _  blazars sample ) .",
    "this more accurate characterization of a sample of blazars , as obtained by combining infrared and @xmath0-ray observations , will provide crucial clues for the understanding the unassociated _ fermi _",
    "objects @xcite , since we expect most of them to be blazars candidates .",
    "we find that the _ fermi _  - _ wise _  blazars cover a very limited region of the [ 3.4]-[4.6]-[12]-[22 ] @xmath1 m color - color plane , narrower than the similar locus found for the complete blazars population of the roma - bzcat seen by _ wise _",
    "( i.e. , the so called _ wise blazar strip _  , massaro et al . 2011b ) ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : color2color1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , we show how the separation between the _ fermi _  - _ wise _  blazars sample and the other extragalactic sources , not dominated by synchrotron emission , is evident even with different choices of infrared colors ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : color1color3 ] and [ fig : color2color3 ] ) . from the three independent infrared colors obtained with",
    "magnitudes , we have derived the values of the spectral indices , finding that the ir spectrum of blazars is clearly consistent with a simple power - law and does not show any evidence of deviation from that .    we investigate the properties of the relation between the spectral indices in the @xmath0-rays and in the infrared .",
    "we found a clear trend between @xmath40 consistent with the expectations of the ssc or the ec scenarios .",
    "in particular , in the @xmath40 plot the dichotomy between the two main classes of blazars , bzbs and bzqs is apparent .",
    "we also calculate the ratio between the infrared flux , integrated over the four _ wise _  bands and the total @xmath0-ray flux as reported in the 2fgl @xcite .",
    "this ratio can be used to estimate the compton dominance ( cd ) parameter .",
    "we find that the cd distribution for the bzb population is more consistent with a synchrotron dominated scenario ; the bzqs , as expected , show values of cd typically higher than unity , in agreement with an inverse compton framework and with the widely accepted ec emission model .",
    "we also considered the bzb subclasses ( i.e. , hsps , isps , lsps ) as defined in @xcite and we investigated their ir - to-@xmath0-ray properties .",
    "we find a strong correlation between the spectral indices and the classification in bzb families ; in particular , the hsps class appears to be very different from the lsps in the @xmath35 distribution .",
    "as already shown in @xcite , blazars can be separated in the _ wise _  ir colors from other sources not dominated by synchrotron emission , however this distinction appears to be more evident when considering those selected on the basis of their @xmath0-ray properties . for this reason , while we are aware that the results discuss in this paper can not be generalized , in principle , to all @xmath0 emitting blazars because of the inhomogeneity of the parent catalog , we deem the peculiar ir features of this large sample of confirmed blazars worth to be investigated and interesting _ per se_. moreover , since blazars constitute the most detected extragalactic sources at @xmath0-ray energies , unidentified _ fermi _  agn candidates or _ fermi _  unassociated objects @xcite are likely to be unknown blazar .",
    "for this reason , we are investigating the possibility of employing this new infrared correlations as diagnostic tools to associate otherwise unassociated _ fermi _  sources with blazars , and so better categorize this interesting class of extragalactic sources @xcite .",

    "<S> blazars constitute the most enigmatic class of extragalactic @xmath0-ray sources , and their observational features have been ascribed to a relativistic jet closely aligned to the line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> they are generally divided in two main classes : the bl lac objects ( bl lacs ) and the flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) . in the case of bl </S>",
    "<S> lacs the double bumped spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is generally described by the synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) emission , while for the fsrqs it is interpreted as due to external compton ( ec ) emission . </S>",
    "<S> recently , we showed that in the [ 3.4]-[4.6]-[12 ] @xmath1 m color - color diagram the blazar population covers a distinct region ( i.e. , the _ wise blazar strip _ , wbs ) , clearly separated from the other extragalactic sources that are dominated by thermal emission . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the relation between the infrared and @xmath0-ray emission for a subset of confirmed blazars from the literature , associated with _ fermi _  sources , for which _ wise _  archival observations are available . this sample is a proper subset of the sample of sources used previously , and the availability of _ fermi _  data is critical to constrain the models on the emission mechanisms for the blazars . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the selected blazars also lie on the _ wise blazar strip _  covering a narrower region of the infrared color - color planes than the overall blazars population . </S>",
    "<S> we then found an evident correlation between the ir and @xmath0-ray spectral indices expected in the ssc and ec frameworks . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we determined the ratio between their @xmath0-ray and infrared fluxes , a surrogate of the ratio of powers between the inverse compton and the synchrotron sed components , and used such parameter to test different emitting scenarios blazars . </S>"
