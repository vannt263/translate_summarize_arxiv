    "recent developments in atomic physics have addressed similar questions by using atom - optical devices ( or atom - chips ) made out of surface - patterned substrates  @xcite or by means of laser manipulation of atoms for trapping  @xcite and atomic lithography  @xcite .",
    "analogous to electronic matter waves , these devices and techniques have the potential to trap and manipulate atomic matter waves down to sub - micron scales . a vast range of phenomena with atoms",
    "can then be studied , several of them bearing close relationships to specific solid state systems .    of particular interest for both bulk and atomic systems",
    "is the quasi-1d regime of quantum coherent _ single mode _ transport . in this ultimate limit ,",
    "the degrees of freedom in the transversal trapping directions are effectively frozen in the quantum - limited ground state of the confining potential .",
    "such one - dimensional system can show distinct physical properties e.g in quasi-1d quantum wires in two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) systems  @xcite and tomonaga - luttinger liquids  @xcite . in elongated gases of ultracold atoms , the one dimensionality is revealed e.g. in magnetic guides  @xcite , in phase fluctuations of quasi - condensates  @xcite , the tonks - girardeau gas of impenetrable bosons  @xcite or one dimensional optical lattices  @xcite . in this broad context , we address two processes that are affected by the quasi-1d geometry .",
    "on one hand , the matter waves can be scattered off e.g. impurities or defects fixed along the guide .",
    "this _ scattering by central fields _ is an important variable in the transport properties and can be strongly affected by the confinement .",
    "this has been revealed by several studies of mesoscopic systems in the context of the landauer approach to the quantized conductance of quantum point - contacts in the presence of impurities  @xcite . on the other hand , two - body _ collision processes _",
    "should be dealt with when the matter wave consists of interacting particles .",
    "a full understanding of these low dimensional systems should therefore deal with both types of scattering .",
    "it should also derive _ ad hoc _ phenomenological parameters such as effective low dimensional coupling strengths from the real 3d character of the interactions .",
    "another context in which such dimensional reduction plays a role is the transmission and reflection of electromagnetic  @xcite and elastic  @xcite waves in transmission lines or resonators .",
    "new light has recently been shed on this subject by studies of atomic collisions in 1d  @xcite and 2d  @xcite .",
    "focusing on a parabolic cylindrical confinement , for which the center of mass can be eliminated , pioneering predictions for collision processes are possible , e.g. that of confinement induced _ scattering resonances _ ( cir ) in 1d .",
    "in such a resonance  @xcite , a total reflection may take place between the colliding atoms .",
    "the @xmath2-wave ( or zero - range ) approximation to the scattering potential  @xcite may be partially lifted , provided the coupling of orbital angular momenta due to the cylindrical geometry are not considered  @xcite .",
    "another property induced by the confinement and closely related to cir is the formation of weakly bound _",

    "rectangular geometries predominate which are most suitable for the growth of semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "similar properties of resonant scattering and weakly localized states are then predicted for non - interacting 2deg systems .",

    "it can treat general cylindrical confinement , parabolic or not , and incorporate all scattering phase - shifts beyond @xmath2-waves , as well as the full couplings of orbital angular momenta due to the broken spherical symmetry .",
    "a comprehensive assessment of the scattering process reveals the most important mechanisms and parameters at play . from this unified description ,",
    "cirs are seen to be a general low energy effect in quasi-1d geometries .",
    "it might be useful e.g. as an alternative gating mechanism in low power transistor - like devices that could incorporate quasi-1d structures  @xcite . the existence of weakly localized bound states and quasi - molecules can , in turn , be extended to include higher orbital angular momentum pairing , whose binding energies _ and _ wavefunctions can be systematically computed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ lowd ]",
    "the present problem of scattering in confined geometries is formulated for both scattering by central fields and collision processes . in section  [ cirpseudo ] , the @xmath2-wave approximation to the scattering potential is briefly reviewed . in section  [ phaseshifts ] , after an overview of the free space scattering , our formalism in terms of green s functions and phase - shifts is developed . in section  [ resonantscatt ] , this formalism is applied to analyze two types of confinement induced effects , namely , cir and weakly localized states . a discussion of the main approximations used is given in section  [ harmonic ] , followed by the conclusions .",
    "in a low energy scattering process under confinement , one expects the scattering potential to affect primarily the degrees of freedom not experiencing external confinement .",
    "the other degrees of freedom are then forced to occupy only one or very few confined states . however",
    ", the very existence of these confined states do play a role due to virtual transitions .",
    "the effects of the latter can become noticeable when properly examining the unconfined degrees of freedom . in this regard",
    "one is lead to calculate effective scattering amplitudes as given by eq.([f1d2 ] ) .",
    "these amplitudes provide a complete description of the quasi-1d problem . for real energies ,",
    "they describe the scattering properties of running waves .",
    "weakly localized states are then found in the complex - energy plane .",
    "consider first the scattering of a _ single _ particle of mass @xmath8 and coordinates @xmath9 by a central field _ fixed _ at the origin .",

    "the hamiltonian is then given by @xmath12 if @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the ranges of @xmath3 and @xmath10 , respectively , then @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 for @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are characteristic energy scales , such as the respective ground state energies ( see fig .",

    "the first condition on the scattering and on the confining potentials assumed in this work is @xmath25 . in this sense , both the potentials @xmath3 and @xmath10 can be relatively _ general _ for this type of scattering process .",
    "this condition implies that there is a distinct region @xmath26 where spherical symmetry still prevails and one can define scattering phase - shifts .",
    "this is an ( intermediate ) asymptotic region , where the effect of the confinement @xmath10 is felt only as a boundary condition to the scattering by @xmath3 ( see section  [ decompose ] ) .",
    "[ guideeigenstates ] depicts the geometry of the problem .",
    "another important condition for the validity of the present approach to scattering in confined geometries is the condition @xmath27 of low total scattering energy @xmath28 ( or fermi energy ) for the hamiltonian @xmath29",
    ". only few excited transverse states @xmath30 above the ground state ( see eq.([eigentrans ] ) ) can be effectively populated .",
    "the scattering process is thus assumed to occur at low temperatures or under sufficiently tight confinement .",
    "alternatively , consider the case of _ collisions _ between e.g. two cold atoms of masses @xmath31 and coordinates @xmath32 , @xmath33 . @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the center of mass ( cm ) and relative coordinates , respectively .",

    "@xmath37 should be _ parabolic _ , so that the cm can be separated exactly .",

    "is not included in eq.([hrelative ] ) .",
    "however , at ultracold temperatures for which only the lowest transversal states of the guide are occupied , the probability to find the atoms in the center of the guide is largest .",
    "consequently , it might be a reasonable zeroth - order approximation to assume on average that the cm coordinates are also confined to the center of the guide",
    ". therefore eq.([hrelative ] ) is a starting point to the dynamics of the relative coordinates for a general interaction @xmath3 , in which the cm fluctuations around the mean value @xmath41 are at the present stage neglected .",
    "because of the symmetry of @xmath42 , the scattering solutions can be restricted to be axially symmetric .",

    "besides cir , a second effect of strong cylindrical confinement is the prediction of weakly bound and localized states . for atom - atom collisions",

    "localized states from higher angular momenta contributions and their _ couplings _ among each other can in principle be systematically obtained by solving eq.([tmatrix ] ) and analyzing the poles of the full amplitude @xmath511 .",

    "here the role of the continuum approximation in section  [ gfunctions ] is discussed by comparing with previous models for scattering under confinement . in the interior of the guide @xmath196 where the confining potential is negligible ,",
    "the green s function @xmath512 under confinement approaches the 3d free space green s function @xmath147 , as shown in eq.([gcgu2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the singularity of @xmath512 as @xmath228 is not only coincident with ( see section  [ cirpseudo ] ) , but it is essentially _ the _ well - known singularity @xmath513 of the 3d scattering scenario without confinement .",
    "in addition , one expects that the details of the confinement , whether parabolic or not , should not be important for the physical understanding .",
    "in fact , the spectrum of _ excited _ transversal states sums up to yield @xmath147 ( integrated over the axial angle @xmath172 ) , as the continuum limit shows .",
    "the only condition is a short - ranged scattering potential @xmath188 or a correspondingly `` flat '' confinement .",
    "the remarkable effects induced by the confinement are in turn directly related to the _ low lying _ transversal states as also demonstrated in  @xcite for a two - dimensional problem .",
    "the discreteness of these states is then captured in the factor @xmath151 and in the correction term @xmath514 , which introduce renormalizations and couplings of orbital angular momenta not accounted for by @xmath147 alone .    for a more quantitative analysis ,",
    "consider the specific case of atom - atom collisions in the low energy @xmath2-wave approximation and under parabolic confinement  @xcite .",
    "as discussed in section  [ cirpseudo ] , the _ discrete _ summation over the transversal states can be dealt with in order to extract the singularity of the scattering solution and to determine the value of the constant @xmath137 in the effective scattering amplitude @xmath515 . on the other hand ,",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath516 in the _ continuum _ limit for this case is @xmath517 ( see eq.(9 ) of  @xcite ) , in agreement with @xmath482 calculated in section  [ bstates ] .",
    "this value @xmath482 arises by using the exact harmonic oscillator energies @xmath518 and @xmath519 .",
    "it can be improved on by e.g. numerically computing @xmath203 . as already pointed out in section  [ gfunctions ] , the exact excited spectrum @xmath216 is substantially different from the `` flat '' potential approximation given in eq.([besselroot ] ) .",
    "however , the discrete sum over this exact parabolic spectrum can be shown  @xcite to have an equal singular behavior @xmath520 as in free space ( see section  [ cirpseudo ] ) .",
    "hence also within the discrete approach , this demonstrates the major role played by the lowest transversal states , whereas the sum over the excited states turns out to be qualitatively confinement - independent .",
    "an analytical treatment of quasi-1d quantum scattering by spherically symmetric and short but finite range potentials in general cylindrical confinement is developed .",
    "the full scattering wavefunction is calculated non - perturbatively without partially resuming perturbative series .",
    "all phase - shifts of the scattering potential can be readily incorporated .",
    "this formalism provides a unified physical picture of the process of confined quasi-1d scattering at low energies and can be applied to impurity scattering in mesoscopic 2deg systems and two - body collisions . following the reasoning related to eq.([gcgu2 ] ) one expects to be able to treat non - cylindrical geometries and quasi-2d scattering in an analogous way . by computing then a few coefficients and functions such as @xmath257 and @xmath203 ( or @xmath198 ) and only the lowest eigenstates of the confining potential , reasonable numerical results are also possible . scattering resonances such as total reflexion , as well as weakly",
    "localized states can be determined . for the particular case of parabolic confinement , the formalism presented here can also be used to obtain e.g. confinement induced two - body weakly bound states . of particular interest is the study of the poles of the scattering amplitude which correlate to orbital angular momenta beyond and how non - parabolic geometries can affect these unconventional pairings due to couplings to the center of mass coordinates .",
