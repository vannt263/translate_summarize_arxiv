    "the lhc has been colliding protons since more than one and a half year with @xmath11 tev and increasing luminosities .",
    "so far , about 5 fb@xmath0 of integrated luminosity have been collected and analyses based on @xmath12 fb@xmath0 of data have been presented by the experimental collaborations in the summer conferences and published afterwards . even though no evidences for the higgs boson nor for new physics ( np ) have been found so far , the @xmath11 tev run has been very successful and started to provide relevant constraints on np models , in particular on low - energy supersymmetry ( susy ) . among those ,",
    "the most stringent ones are the cms  @xcite and atlas  @xcite searches for squarks and gluinos in the missing transverse energy plus multi - jets channel , based on @xmath13 fb@xmath0 of data .",
    "these analyses provide bounds on first and second generation squarks ( @xmath14 ) and gluino ( @xmath15 ) masses of about 1 tev , if @xmath16 , and a bound on the gluino mass , @xmath17 gev , if @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the prospects are that at least 10  fb@xmath0 will be collected before the long shutdown planned in 2013 with the possibility , still under discussion , of increasing the center of mass energy to 8 tev in the 2012 run .",
    "one main motivation for introducing low - energy susy is provided by the stabilization of the electroweak scale .",
    "such a `` natural '' solution of the hierarchy problem , which requires a susy spectrum not far above the electroweak scale , has been already challenged by the negative results of susy and higgs boson searches at lep  @xcite .",
    "however , the degree of fine - tuning required for susy to give the correct @xmath19 mass depends on the actual susy model and can be relaxed in specific models that modify the impact of the lep bound on the higgs mass ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to understand the status of the fine - tuning problem now that the recent susy searches at the lhc started to constrain directly the masses of the superpartners far beyond the previous lep and tevatron bounds .",
    "this important question has been recently addressed by a number of papers  @xcite .",
    "a low degree of fine - tuning is a valuable criterium for discriminating among different susy models and , within a given model , to identify the preferred ranges of the fundamental parameters .",
    "the only experimental evidence that seems to point towards light np is the long - standing discrepancy between the standard model ( sm ) prediction and the experimental determination of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath2 , that is currently above the 3@xmath20 level  @xcite .",
    "the requirement of a sizeable susy contribution to @xmath2 clearly selects a limited portion of the parameter space corresponding , in particular , to quite light electroweak gauginos and sleptons and sizeable values of @xmath21 .",
    ", as well as the interplay of lhc and flavour observables , in the view of the recent susy searches at the lhc , see @xcite . ] within models giving definite relations among different superpartner masses , such as the cmssm , this translates into the requirement of a generically light susy spectrum . the compatibility of the parameter space preferred by @xmath2 with the lhc bounds and a low fine - tuning is an interesting question we are going to address in this paper .",
    "besides the interplay of @xmath2 with natural susy , the main focus of the present work is on the impact of lhc susy searches on the gut scale ratios of the yukawa couplings and their fine - tuning price .",
    "the predictions for high - energy yukawa relations are known to have a sensitive dependence on low - energy susy threshold corrections and thus on the susy spectrum .",
    "such dependence allows us to identify regions of the parameter space preferred by given yukawa relations and , on the other hand , it might provide a powerful tool to test high - energy physics , such as gut or fermion mass models , once signals of susy would be discovered at the lhc . for recent examples of such interplay , see  @xcite . in the view of the present and future susy searches at the lhc , it can be of interest to check whether peculiar yukawa gut ratios , and thus high - energy susy scenarios , are favoured by naturalness considerations . in the following",
    ", we are going to study this problem within the usual cmssm , which is a convenient benchmark model providing a spectrum that is approximately realised in many susy scenarios , such as msugra combined with the assumption of sequestering @xcite , several gut and fermion mass models with non - abelian family symmetries , and it is phenomenologically motivated by the so - called susy flavour problem , which points towards family universal soft susy breaking terms ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the consequences of relaxing the universality assumption , for instance of the higgs mass parameters , which is known to have an impact on yukawa unification , see e.g.  @xcite , will be studied elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we briefly review the used fine - tuning measure and identify low fine - tuning regions of the parameter space .",
    "we show the connection of the latter to the gut @xmath6 yukawa coupling ratios in section 3 before proceeding with a numerical analysis in section 4 .",
    "finally , section 5 is devoted to summarize the results and draw conclusions out of them .",
    "the problem of fine - tuning in the mssm has been extensively discussed in the literature starting with @xcite ( for a more extensive list of references , see @xcite ) : here we just present a short review of the problem in order to introduce on wider grounds our analysis and comment on the corrections on the usual tree - level fine - tuning measures that we have included @xcite .    in the mssm",
    "the z - boson mass can be expressed in terms of the supersymmetric @xmath22 parameter and the soft masses of the up- and down - type higgs by means of the tree - level formula @xmath23 the latter , in the case of large @xmath24 in which we are mainly interested , can be expressed as @xmath25 it is easy to spot that the value of the low energy observable @xmath26 can thus be obtained by the algebraic sum of the rg evolved gut parameters @xmath22 and @xmath27 , that are quantities of order of the susy breaking scale .",
    "it is thus evident that a certain amount of tuning is needed to get the correct value of the @xmath19 boson mass . to quantify the amount of fine - tuning needed in a certain point of the mssm parameter space ,",
    "the following measure has been introduced @xcite @xmath28 @xmath29 reflects the dependence of @xmath26 on the variation of a given gut scale lagrangian parameter @xmath30 .",
    "the value of such a quantity gives exactly what we are interested in : for instance @xmath31 implies a necessary cancellation of @xmath32 part in @xmath33 .",
    "the global measure of fine - tuning in a certain point of the parameter space is then simply defined as the maximum of all the single fine - tunings @xmath34 now we move to discuss the measure for the single parameters . setting aside rg effects for the moment , one can easily obtain from eq .   the fine - tuning in @xmath22 @xmath35 anyway , @xmath22 is not on the same ground as the other input parameters of the theory , since it is usually determined at low energies so that it yields the correct value for the @xmath19 boson mass .",
    "one can thus recast @xmath36 in terms of @xmath27 as @xmath37 from eq .",
    "it is evident that it is necessary to give a closer look at the low energy value of @xmath27 , that depends in a non trivial way on the cmssm parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the latter enter the theory at the gut scale @xmath41  gev .",
    "we can express @xmath27 as a polynomial in the cmssm parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 where the coefficients depend on the susy scale , the yukawa and the gauge couplings .",
    "let us now consider as an example the best - fit cmssm point obtained in  @xcite , with @xmath42  gev , @xmath43  gev , @xmath44  tev , @xmath45 and positive @xmath22 .",
    "for this point we find at the susy scale @xmath46  tev @xmath47 the form of the polynomial can be understood considering one - loop rg equation of @xmath27 .",
    "the coefficients were computed by fitting such a polynomial in a neighborhood of the best - fit point and cross - checked with the semi - analytic formula obtained similarly to @xcite .",
    "the coefficients in this equation depend strongly on the top yukawa coupling and the strong coupling constant .",
    "therefore it is important to consider the fine - tuning also in this quantities @xcite , weighting them properly by their experimental uncertainty .",
    "anyway they turn out to be subleading and hence we do not discuss them further .    due to the presence of the term @xmath48 in the polynomial",
    "the two parameters can not be treated independently in the determination of the fine - tuning . in turn",
    "we consider @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "notice that large gaugino masses as well as large trilinear couplings give large fine - tuning .",
    "another feature is noteworthy , showing the close connection of @xmath40 and @xmath39 . given a specific value for @xmath39 the minimal fine - tuning is obtained for @xmath51 and not as naively expected for @xmath52 , yielding @xmath53 compared to @xmath54 .",
    "this is due to the large negative contribution in the rge running of the stop trilinear coupling @xmath55 provided by gluino - top loops , that usually drives @xmath55 to large and negative low - energy values even with a vanishing inital value at the gut scale .",
    "the discussion so far was very instructive since it gives a general flavour of the main features of the fine - tuning measure , but it has to be refined to take into account loop effects @xcite , which modify the original eq .  .",
    "the effect of going beyond tree - level is two - fold .",
    "on one side there is an obvious modification to the higgs potential ; on the other side loop corrections affect also the higgs vacuum expectation value @xmath56 .",
    "we do not go into detailed calculations here , but we just notice that taking into account all the relevant corrections roughly reduces the fine - tuning by a factor @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the light higgs boson mass .",
    "such effect is clearly sizeable in the parameter region of interest , where @xmath59  gev . in turn",
    "considering the one - loop effects shifts the lowest fine - tuning regions given in terms of @xmath60 , because of the higgs mass dependence on the trilinear soft terms ] .",
    "fine - tuning measures in general should be taken with a grain of salt .",
    "it is a matter of personal taste how much fine - tuning one accepts as `` natural '' and , clearly , changing the fine - tuning measure changes as well the `` amount '' of fine - tuning .",
    "nevertheless , we want to stress here that even in the cmssm there are still regions of the allowed parameter space with a reasonable amount of fine - tuning , rendering them more attractive than others .",
    "it is well known that in the mssm exists a class of one - loop corrections to the yukawa couplings of the down - type quarks and the charged leptons , which are sizeable if @xmath24 is large @xcite .",
    "these corrections obviously depend on the susy breaking parameters , which can be constrained by the requirement of low fine - tuning , as discussed in the last section . here",
    "we estimate the size of the susy threshold corrections in the low fine - tuning region .",
    "we focus here on the third generation : for the bottom quark mass we can write @xmath62 where , neglecting bino and wino contributions and ewsb effects , the correction @xmath63 is given by @xcite @xmath64 where the loop function @xmath65 is defined as @xmath66 the correction @xmath63 becomes bigger if @xmath67 and @xmath55 increase and the sfermion mass parameters decrease .",
    "the restrictions derived from low fine - tuning are strong only for the gluino mass and the soft trilinears : from the tree - level considerations of the previous section indeed we know that small @xmath39 and @xmath68 are preferred .",
    "the dependence of the fine - tuning on @xmath38 and @xmath24 ( for @xmath69 ) is rather weak , while that on @xmath22 is stronger .",
    "anyway , @xmath22 itself is not a free parameter in our setup , being determined from successful ewsb .    to estimate the size of the susy threshold corrections we set therefore @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72  tev , @xmath73  gev .",
    "the choice for @xmath24 was inspired again by the best - fit point of  @xcite , while @xmath38 and @xmath39 were chosen such that the recent collider bounds @xcite are satisfied and the resulting fine - tuning is not very large . from our numerical analysis including loop corrections to the fine - tuning measure we find for this point a fine - tuning of about 25 for either sign of @xmath22 .    using softsusy @xcite for the calculation of the input parameters of eq .",
    ", we find @xmath74 at the gut scale @xmath75 @xcite and hence we find , for the considered point , @xmath76 for @xmath77 and @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "this already tells us that susy threshold corrections to the yukawa coupling ratios for the low fine - tuning region are in the ballpark to correctly reproduce both the common gut prediction @xmath80 as well as the new relation @xmath4 @xcite .    to perfectly reproduce these predictions",
    "we would prefer slightly larger threshold corrections , which can be accomodated by increasing @xmath39 , even though this would make the fine - tuning larger .",
    "these considerations are nevertheless based on the tree - level relations of the previous section ; including loop corrections to the fine - tuning could have some impact on the `` natural '' values of the susy threshold corrections . furthermore considering experimental results will constrain them even more and will rule out , for instance , the @xmath79 case as we will see in the following section .",

    "on the other hand , if the @xmath2 constraint is relaxed to 5@xmath20 , the allowed region includes points with a negative @xmath22 parameter and the range for @xmath105 extends to [ 1.02 , 1.70 ] .",
