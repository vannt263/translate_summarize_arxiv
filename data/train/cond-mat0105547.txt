    "mixtures of hard spheres play a pivotal role in the statistical mechanics of liquids . not only",
    "do they provide a realistic reference system for describing the structure and thermodynamics of simple atomic mixtures and mixture of colloidal particles , they are also of considerable intrinsic interest . in particular , investigating the properties of asymmetric binary hard - sphere mixtures became a topic of much activity when it was recognized by biben and hansen @xcite that such athermal mixtures might afford important examples of pure entropy - driven fluid - fluid phase separation .",
    "the most studied model is that of _ additive _ hard spheres , where the cross diameter @xmath1 and @xmath2 refers to the big - big and @xmath3 to the small - small diameters .",
    "there is now compelling evidence to suggest that additive mixtures , with sufficiently small size ratios @xmath4 , do undergo fluid - fluid phase separation but this transition remains metastable w.r.t .",
    "the fluid - solid transition @xcite .",
    "the other well studied model is the so - called asakura - oosawa ( ao ) model @xcite of a colloid - polymer mixture in which the colloid - colloid interaction is hard - sphere like , with diameter @xmath5 , and the colloid - polymer interaction is also hard with diameter @xmath6 , whereas the polymer - polymer interaction is zero , i.e. @xmath7 , corresponding to ideal interpenetrating coils .",
    "the cross diameter @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the radius of gyration of the polymer .",
    "various approximate theories @xcite and some simulation studies for simplified versions of the ao model @xcite showed that when the size ratio @xmath10 is larger than about @xmath11 fluid - fluid phase separation is stable w.r.t . the fluid - solid transition .",
    "the ao model can be regarded as an extreme _ non - additive _ mixture with @xmath12 .",
    "one can , of course , investigate mixtures with arbitrary non - additivity and recent studies of binary hard - sphere mixtures have indicated that a small degree of positive non - additivity in the cross diameter @xmath13 might be sufficient to induce a fluid - fluid transition @xcite . by employing an effective one - component treatment and a variety of liquid state perturbation theories , louis et .",
    "al @xcite have demonstrated that non - additivity should have a profound effect on both the fluid - fluid and fluid - solid transition in highly asymmetric hard - sphere mixtures . however , their treatment is based on an empirical approximation @xcite for the effective ( depletion ) potential between two big spheres rather than any systematic derivation of an effective one - component hamiltonian for the non - additive hard - sphere mixture . in this paper",
    "we develop such an approach following the path that was trodden in the recent studies of the additive mixture @xcite and in the special case of the ao model @xcite .",
    "we show that the same formal technique of integrating out the degrees of freedom of the smaller species , used in ref .",
    "@xcite , applies equally well to non - additive mixtures ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : formal ] ) .",
    "we were motivated toward such an approach by the following considerations : a ) treating highly asymmetric mixtures by brute force simulation is beset by ergodicity problems and slow equilibration when the packing fraction of the small species is substantial , b ) for small size ratios three and higher body potentials in the effective hamiltonian do not have a significant effect on the phase behavior of the additive @xcite or of the ao @xcite model , i.e. in both models phase transitions are determined primarily by the effective pairwise potential between the big particles and we expect the same to be true for small size ratios in systems with intermediate degrees of non - additivity .",
    "c ) the effective pairwise potential which arises in the formal development of the theory is the depletion potential , introduced into colloid science by asakura and oosawa , and now much studied by theory , simulation @xcite and experiment . indeed a variety of experimental techniques @xcite have been developed to measure the depletion potential between a colloidal particle , immersed in a sea of small colloids or non - adsorbing polymer , and a wall or another big colloid .",
    "interpreting the results of such experiments requires a reliable theory .",
    "recently we have shown @xcite that a density functional approach ( dft ) provides an accurate means of calculating the depletion potential for additive hard spheres . in the present paper",
    "we show ( sec .",
    "[ sec : dft ] ) that the same dft approach remains valid for the non - additive case and can therefore be used to investigate a much wider class of depletion potentials than one might have suspected a priori .",
    "we find that even very small degrees of non - additivity can have a very pronounced effect on the shape of the depletion potential , which leads to significant changes of the magnitude , and sometimes the sign , of the second virial coefficient @xmath0 associated with the total effective potential between two big spheres .",
    "such changes in @xmath0 may , in turn , have repercussions for the phase behavior , and may be directly accessible by experiments .",
    "we begin by defining what we mean by non - additivity .",
    "a non - additive binary hard - sphere mixture is characterized by the diameters ( distances of closest approach of the centers of the spheres ) @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath13 where the subscripts @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote big and small .",
    "these diameters describe the ( pairwise ) interaction potentials between two spheres @xmath16 with @xmath17 .",
    "we follow the usual convention and introduce the non - additivity parameter @xmath18 via @xmath19 and allow @xmath18 to be positive or negative .",
    "additive hard - sphere mixtures have @xmath20 .    in the following we consider two different routes to introducing non - additivity into a binary hard - sphere mixtures . in both routes",
    "we keep the diameter of the big spheres @xmath2 and the number density of the small spheres in the reservoir @xmath21 fixed but allow for * ( a ) * changes in the diameter of the small spheres @xmath3 while keeping the cross diameter @xmath13 constant or * ( b ) * changes in the cross diameter @xmath13 while keeping the diameter of the small spheres @xmath3 constant .",
    "these two types of changes are illustrated in fig s  [ fig : non - add - a ] and [ fig : non - add - b ] respectively .    in the first route * ( a ) * , which was introduced in an earlier letter by two of us @xcite",
    ", we can smoothly follow a path that connects the additive hard - sphere mixture to the asakura - oosawa model@xcite . as mentioned above ,",
    "the small particles are modeled as ideal gas particles with zero diameter @xmath22 and @xmath23 , keeping the same cross diameter as in the additive case , i.e. we require @xmath24 so that @xmath25 the ao limit , defined by @xmath26 , implies @xmath27 , the ( fixed ) size ratio . within route * ( a ) * choosing @xmath28 would give rise to @xmath29 which is unphysical , of course . for a given value of the non - additivity parameter @xmath18 and a fixed number density of the small spheres",
    "@xmath21 it follows that their packing fraction @xmath30 also varies with @xmath18 : @xmath31 where @xmath32",
    ". clearly @xmath33 decreases with increasing @xmath18 in the range @xmath34 . on the other hand , for negative non - additivity , @xmath35 , @xmath33 increases rapidly with increasing @xmath36 and for studies of the fluid phase we should restrict @xmath37 , the value of the packing fraction at the bulk freezing transition of hard - spheres .",
    "if we consider route * ( b ) * , the route used by most previous authors@xcite , both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are kept fixed and the cross diameter @xmath13 becomes a function of @xmath18 through eq .",
    "( [ defna ] ) .",
    "note that this case is very different from case * ( a ) * as the packing fraction @xmath38 of the small spheres remains constant through the whole range of non - additivity and the asakura - oosawa limit can only be reached in the limit of @xmath39 in which the depth of the depletion potential approaches zero as well .",

    "we begin by formally integrating out the degrees of freedom of the small spheres and determine the form of the effective hamiltonian of the one - component fluid .",
    "we demonstrate that each term of the effective hamiltonian of the non - additive system can be determined using a theory for an additive mixture . in a second step",

    "@xmath84 is proportional to the excess ( over ideal ) chemical potential of species @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath87 and , in general , depends on the density of both species .",

    "there is strong evidence from direct simulation studies of the additive binary system that retaining only two - body contributions in the effective hamiltonian provides a very good account of the equilibrium phase behavior for @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions were reached for a lattice version of the ao model@xcite . in this study",
    "we shall focus on such highly asymmetric systems and neglect three and higher - body contributions to the effective hamiltonian . with this assumption",
    "it follows that the structure of the homogeneous fluid ( equilibrium correlation functions of the big spheres ) is determined solely by the effective pairwise potential @xmath121 since @xmath72 and @xmath75 do not depend on the coordinates of the big particles @xcite .",
    "it is also straightforward to show that the _ phase equilibria _ of the binary mixture do not depend on the zero and one - body term @xcite .",

    "<S> we show that the formal procedure of integrating out the degrees of freedom of the small spheres in a binary hard - sphere mixture works equally well for non - additive as it does for additive mixtures . for highly asymmetric mixtures ( small size ratios ) the resulting effective hamiltonian of the one - component fluid of big spheres , which consists of an infinite number of many - body interactions , </S>",
    "<S> should be accurately approximated by truncating after the term describing the effective pair interaction . using a density functional treatment developed originally for additive hard - sphere mixtures we determine the zero , one , and two - body contribution to the effective hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that even small degrees of positive or negative non - additivity have significant effect on the shape of the depletion potential . </S>",
    "<S> the second virial coefficient @xmath0 , corresponding to the effective pair interaction between two big spheres , is found to be a sensitive measure of the effects of non - additivity . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of @xmath0 with the density of the small spheres shows significantly different behavior for additive , slightly positive and slightly negative non - additive mixtures . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the possible repercussions of these results for the phase behavior of binary hard - sphere mixtures and suggest that measurements of @xmath0 might provide a means of determining the degree of non - additivity in real colloidal mixtures . </S>"
