    "cosmic rays in the heliosphere experience changes in their intensities as a function of energy , position , and time due to the out - blowing solar wind and the embedded heliospheric magnetic field ( hmf ) .",
    "this process is known as cosmic - ray modulation .",
    "when cosmic rays enter the heliosphere , they experience four major modulation processes : ( i ) convection , due to the expanding solar wind , ( ii ) energy changes such as adiabatic energy losses , continuous stochastic acceleration and even diffusive shock acceleration , ( iii ) diffusion due to the random walk along and across the turbulent hmf , and ( iv ) drifts , due to the gradient and curvatures in the hmf or any abrupt changes in the field direction such as the current sheet .",
    "cosmic - ray propagation is influenced by solar activity and this leads to 11- and 22-year modulation cycles in the cosmic - ray intensities .",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .    concerning the theoretical description of long - term cosmic - ray modulation , it was shown by @xcite and @xcite that in order to describe cosmic - ray modulation over long periods , some form of propagating diffusion barriers is required .",
    "this is especially true for solar maximum activity periods when step decreases in cosmic - ray intensities are observed .",
    "the largest of these diffusion barriers are called global merged interaction regions ( gmirs ) : @xcite .",
    "equally important to modulation are gradient , curvature , and current sheet drifts @xcite as confirmed by the comprehensive modelling done by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors showed that it is possible to simulate , to first - order , a complete 22-year modulation cycle by including a combination of drifts and gmirs in a time - dependent modulation model .",
    "the conclusion was made that drifts are mainly responsible for time - dependent modulation during moderate to minimum solar conditions with cosmic - ray intensities changing mainly due to changes in the current sheet during @xmath1 polarity cycles .",
    "however , towards solar activity maximum , gmirs cause the intensities to decrease in a step - like manner with drifts becoming less dominant . for reviews see @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite suggested that time - dependent global changes in the hmf magnitude alone might be responsible for long - term modulation .",
    "this was tested by @xcite , who introduced the compound approach , where all the transport ( diffusion and drift ) parameters are scaled with a time - dependent function based on the observed solar magnetic field at earth and the current sheet tilt angle @xcite .",
    "this resulted in diffusion coefficients and drifts changing over a solar cycle , with smaller values for solar maxima compared to solar minima .",
    "as shown by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite this compound approach incorporated in a numerical modulation model yields results in good agreement with spacecraft observations ( _ ulysses _ in particular ) at various energies .",
    "the compound model of @xcite is based on an empirical approach where computed results are compared to observations in order to construct a realistic time dependence in the transport coefficients .",
    "this was done because of a lack of a clear theory on how diffusion and drift coefficients should change over a solar cycle .",
    "however , recent progress by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite gives a much clearer picture of how the diffusion coefficients depend on basic turbulence quantities , such as the magnetic field magnitude and variance , that change over a solar cycle .",
    "these new theories , which have never been tested time - dependently , are introduced in a numerical model to calculate long - term , time - dependent cosmic - ray modulation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have shown that in order to construct a time dependence in the transport coefficients , time - dependent changes in basic turbulence quantities such as the magnetic field magnitude and variance as well as the tilt angle of the current sheet are needed .",
    "these quantities are then transported out into the simulated heliosphere and result in realistic computed modulation on a global scale when compared to observations .    in this work",
    "we will again show that after incorporating recent theoretical advances , the model produces results that are compatible with observations along the _ voyager 1 _ spacecraft trajectory and at earth up to @xmath02004 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , not discussed before is the finding that the model fails to reproduce observations at earth from @xmath02004 onwards .",
    "it will be shown in detail that after varying most of the important model parameters , the model still could not reproduce the observations at earth for the period @xmath02004 onwards using the assumed time dependence in the transport parameters as given by the recent theoretical advances .",
    "it will be shown that in order to fit the observations at earth from @xmath02004 onwards , a different time dependence in the diffusion coefficients is needed and that cosmic - ray modulation in this particular solar cycle is largely dependent on changes in value and rigidity of the diffusion coefficients and not primarily on changing the drift coefficient or the tilt angle of the current sheet ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the above - mentioned modulation processes were combined by @xcite into a transport equation ( tpe ) given as @xmath2 here , @xmath3 is the time , @xmath4 is rigidity , @xmath5 is any particle source inside the heliosphere , @xmath6 is the solar wind velocity , @xmath7 is the isotropic diffusion tensor , and @xmath8 the pitch angle averaged guiding center drift velocity for a near isotropic distribution function [ @xmath9 .",
    "the differential intensity [ @xmath10 is related to @xmath11 by @xmath12 .    this equation is solved numerically in this work in terms of time and rigidity in two - dimensional space @xmath13 with @xmath14 the radial distance and @xmath15 the polar angle .",
    "the rigidity [ @xmath4 ] is defined as the momentum per charge for a given particle _",

    "of primary importance to cosmic - ray modulation is the coupling of the transport parameters to the background magnetic field and turbulence . for the parallel mean free path",

    "although there is no acceleration of cosmic rays considered in this model , the effect of the inner heliosheath is simulated by changing ( decreasing ) the transport parameters across the ts .",

    "it follows that the difference between solar minimum and solar maximum is largely dependent on the magnitude of the drift coefficient given that the diffusion coefficients have the time dependence as described here .",
