    "the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) plays a fundamental role in studies of distant galaxies .",
    "stars with masses near the main sequence turnoff dominate the luminosity of galaxies , and so an imf is normally employed to extrapolate the properties of the turnoff stars ( e.g. , their number , age , and metallicity ) to the more numerous , but fainter low mass stars . with an assumed imf one can then estimate a variety of galactic properties , such as the total star formation rate and stellar mass .",
    "it is standard practice to assume that the imf is universal ( temporally and spatially invariant ) and equal to either the @xcite or milky way ( mw ) disk imf @xcite .",
    "this assumption is supported by the lack of strong evidence for imf variation within the mw @xcite .",
    "this lack of variation has been difficult to reconcile with theoretical expectations , as nearly every model for the imf predicts at least some variation with physical properties , such as the temperature and pressure of molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , despite the broad consensus that imf variation should exist , there is little agreement on the main variables expected to control the variation , or even on the qualitative sense of the expected variation .    in the past several years two independent modeling techniques",
    " stellar population synthesis ( sps ) and dynamical  have pointed toward possible variation in the form of the imf within the early - type / quiescent galaxy population .",
    "in particular , these techniques suggest that the imf becomes increasingly ` bottom - heavy ' ( i.e. , an imf with a greater proportion of low - mass , @xmath4 , stars compared to the mw imf ) with increasing galaxy mass , velocity dispersion , and/or elemental abundance pattern ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "at the same time , several studies have found evidence for ` bottom - light ' imfs in low mass systems @xcite , and perhaps even in the small magellanic cloud @xcite . in the most extreme cases the quoted variation in the imf amongst massive early - type galaxies",
    "would imply a revision in the stellar masses upward by a factor of @xmath5 .    despite the broad qualitative agreement between two independent techniques ,",
    "there is still some room for skepticism .",
    "both dynamical and sps techniques are subject to a variety of systematic uncertainties that are difficult to quantify . only very recently have several groups begun to make direct comparisons between dynamical and sps constraints on imf variation @xcite .",
    "the goal of this _ letter _ is to directly compare dynamical and sps - based mass - to - light ratios for a sample of compact early - type galaxies .",
    "we expect these galaxies to be stellar - dominated , at least within an effective radius .",
    "consideration of compact galaxies is therefore expected to reduce an important source of systematic uncertainty in the dynamical models ( i.e. , the inclusion of a dark halo ) .",
    "the rest of this _ letter _ is organized as follows . in section [",
    "s : data ] we describe the data and sample selection ; in section [ s : methods ] we provide a brief overview of the dynamical and sps techniques .",

    "is assumed with the following parameters : @xmath7 .",
    "the sample of compact early - type galaxies analyzed in this _",

    "stellar velocity dispersions , @xmath0 , are taken to be a weighted mean of the `` sdss '' and `` princeton '' spectroscopic pipelines .",
    "total circularized half - light radii , @xmath8 , are measured via bulge plus disk decompositions provided in @xcite . as a check on these half - light radii , we also consider half - light sizes provided by the sdss photometric pipeline ( specifically , the sizes based on a de vaucouleurs light profile ) .",
    "all sizes are corrected for seeing .",
    "photometric stellar mass - to - light ratios , @xmath9 , are available for this sample from two sources : a catalog produced by one of us ( mendel et al . in prep ) , and a catalog provided by the mpa / jhu group ( available at http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/sdss/dr7/ ) .",
    "the mendel et al .",
    "stellar masses were derived by modeling the sdss @xmath10 total magnitudes ( based on the simard et al .",
    "light profile fits ) employing standard population synthesis techniques . in both catalogs ,",
    "stellar mass - to - light ratios were also computed from the fiber - based photometry in order to compare directly with spectroscopically - based values . in the photometric analyses a @xcite imf was adopted .",
    "we have converted these masses to a @xcite imf by increasing them by 10% , the approximate conversion between the two imfs for old stellar populations .",
    "the quantity @xmath11 will throughout refer to stellar masses assuming a mw @xcite imf .",
    "we focus on compact galaxies in this work because there are several reasons to believe that they should be stellar - dominated at least within an effective radius .",
    "first , their densities are so high that one would require substantial modification to a standard nfw @xcite dark matter density profile in order to achieve central dark matter densities high enough to rival the stellar densities . if these compact galaxies resided within nfw dark matter halos of mass @xmath12 with a concentration of @xmath13 ( expected from the @xmath14 relation ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the dark matter fraction , @xmath15 , within @xmath16 would be 5% .",
    "considering concentrations that lie @xmath17 above the concentration - mass relation ( @xmath18 ) yields @xmath19% . increasing the halo mass to @xmath20 changes these fractions to 7% and 13% .",
    "these numbers do not include the possibility of adiabatic contraction .",
    "we will show in section [ s : res ] that a dark matter fraction of 65% would be required to explain the totality of the trend reported here .",
    "this is incompatible with kinematic models for these galaxies .",
    "they follow the virial fundamental plane , and their observed scaling relations and two - dimensional kinematics can only be fit with mass - follows light models , with an upper limit on the central dm fractions of < 20% ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "these cuts result in a sample of 19,000 galaxies .",
    "we then computed stellar surface mass densities within @xmath16 according to : @xmath26 , where @xmath8 is measured in the @xmath27band and @xmath28 is the photometrically - derived total stellar mass assuming a mw imf .",
    "galaxies were selected to be compact via the cut @xmath29 .",
    "these cuts yield 1100 compact early - type galaxies ( @xmath30 of the early - type galaxy population ) that define the sample used in the present analysis . in the following analysis",

    "these galaxies are remarkably dense and small ; from the lowest to the highest @xmath0 bins , the mean sizes range from 0.6 kpc to 2.3 kpc , corresponding approximately to @xmath37 at the median redshift of the sample ( see table 1 ) . for reference ,",
    "the sdss pixel scale is @xmath38 and the seeing is @xmath39 . only the largest galaxies in our sample are therefore ( just ) resolved within the half - light radius .",
    "note however that half - light sizes can be reliably estimated even for such small galaxies because their total sizes subtend a considerably larger angle on the sky ( see figure [ fig : img ] ) .",
    "the sdss obtains spectra with fibers that have @xmath40 diameters .",
    "despite the fact that our sample is of relatively low redshift , their high surface densities imply that the sdss fibers cover a significant fraction of the galaxy . from the lowest to the highest @xmath0 bins the fiber covers on average the inner 1.9@xmath41 to 0.7@xmath41 ( see table 1 ) . when fitting the data to sps models we utilize spectra that are stacked in bins of @xmath0 .",
    "each spectrum is continuum - normalized and broadened to a common dispersion of @xmath42 , and the stack is created by giving equal weight to each spectrum , after masking strong sky lines .",
    "the resulting stacked spectra have signal - to - noise ratios ranging from @xmath43 @xmath44 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : prop ] we show the robustness of the parameters used to select the compact early - type galaxy sample .",
    "the key point is that sizes , luminosities , velocity dispersions , and stellar masses ( with an assumed mw imf ) are all measured consistently between different images , in different bands , and/or using different photometric pipelines .",
    "therefore , even though we have selected outliers ( i.e. , extremely com- pact galaxies ) , their properties are robust and not due to measurement errors .",
    "note that the derivations of @xmath45 shown below use the full galaxy light profiles , and thus do not depend explicitly on any of these measured parameters",
    "in this section we describe the techniques for computing @xmath45 and @xmath46 for our sample of compact early - type galaxies .",
    "stellar mass - to - light ratios are computed by fitting an sps model to the stacked absorption line spectra of the compact early - type galaxies .",
    "the sps model used herein was developed in @xcite . in its present form the model contains 27 free parameters , including the redshift and velocity dispersion , a two - part power - law imf , two population ages , four nuisance parameters , and the abundances of 17 elements .",
    "these parameters are fit to the data via a markov chain monte carlo fitting technique .",
    "for the purposes of this _ letter _ the most important feature is that the imf is constrained directly by the data , in particular by a variety of spectral features that lie mainly in the red spectral range ( e.g. , numerous tio bands at @xmath47 , na@xmath48i at 8200 and ca@xmath48ii at @xmath49 ) .",
    "the data and models are split into four wavelength intervals and within each interval the spectra are normalized by a high - order polynomial ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "the main result of this fitting procedure is an estimate of the true stellar mass - to - light ratio , @xmath46 ; ` true ' because the imf is included as a parameter determined by the data . for each set of model parameters we also keep track of the stellar mass - to - light ratio that would be expected assuming a mw @xcite imf ,",
    "notice that the ratio between the measured stellar mass and the stellar mass assuming a mw imf , @xmath50 , is sensitive only to the imf .",
    "the resulting best - fit parameters are very well - constrained , with essentially no degeneracies between the imf and other parameters .",
    "quoted errors are @xmath51 limits marginalized over the full posterior distribution .    for each galaxy",
    "we calculate @xmath1 and @xmath45 from the following procedure ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "we start with a galaxy light profile parameterized by circularized and de - projected srsic @xmath52 and @xmath53 components .",
    "then , assuming that mass follows light , we calculate the radial velocity dispersion profile by solving the spherical jeans equations assuming isotropic orbits ( @xmath54 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a purely pressure - supported system .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , due to the large fraction of the galaxy light covered by the fiber , the dynamical masses are only weakly dependent on stellar anisotropy ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "adopting @xmath55 changes @xmath1 by @xmath56% .",
    "we then compute the projected velocity dispersion ( convolved with @xmath57 fwhm seeing , typical for the sdss ) within the @xmath40 diameter aperture used by sdss .",
    "finally , we compute @xmath1 by scaling the model aperture velocity dispersion to match the observed aperture velocity dispersion .",
    "notice that the dynamical masses are completely independent of the sps stellar masses , and since mass follows light , @xmath45 is constant with radius .",
    "we then compute the mean @xmath45 within the sdss fiber aperture in bins of @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to the formal statistical error , we also assign a systematic error of 0.1 dex to the dynamical masses .",
    "the motivation for this error comes in part from figure [ fig : prop ] , where sizes and dispersion can differ by @xmath58 dex depending on assumptions .",
    "in addition , uncertainties in the anisotropy profile , degree of rotational support , etc .",
    ", when combined can be expected to affect @xmath45 at the 0.1 dex level",
    ".    there are four distinct ` mass - to - light ratios ' in this _ letter _ , which we summarize here for clarity .",
    "@xmath45 is based on a dynamical model ; @xmath46 is reserved for the ` true ' stellar mass - to - light ratio inferred from spectral fitting when the imf is left as a free parameter ; @xmath59 is , generically , the stellar mass - to - light ratio assuming a mw imf . in the present work",
    "there are two estimates of this last quantity ; the first from fitting @xmath10 photometry , and the second from fitting the absorption line spectra with the imf fixed to the mw form . in practice",
    "these two techniques provide nearly identical estimates of @xmath59 , so we do not distinguish between these two except where necessary .",
    "finally , notice that all quoted mass - to - light ratios are determined within the same aperture , specifically within the @xmath40 sdss fiber .",
    "` total ' mass - to - light ratios and masses are only used for selecting the sample .",
    "the best - fit mass - to - light ratios , @xmath60 , for the three techniques  photometric , spectroscopic , and dynamical  are shown in figure [ fig : mli ] .",
    "the red lines compare photometrically and spectroscopically derived @xmath59 values , and it is encouraging that they agree well .",
    "the blue lines compare the results from dynamical models to the results from the spectroscopic model , where in the latter case the imf is a free variable derived from the data .",
    "all @xmath60 ratios in this figure were derived within the same aperture ( the spectroscopic fiber ) . as we argued in section [ s : data ] , the expected contribution from dark matter should be small in these compact galaxies , certainly less than the dark matter fractions of @xmath61% that would be required to attribute entirely to dark matter the difference between @xmath45 and @xmath62 at high @xmath0 .    the main result of this _ letter _ is shown in figure [ fig : res ] . in this figure",
    "we compare the best - fit dynamical and sps - based masses as a function of galaxy velocity dispersion , @xmath0 .",
    "the key feature of this diagram is that masses are plotted in units of the stellar mass assuming a mw imf , @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath63-axis is thus insensitive to normal stellar population variation such as stellar age , metallicity , etc .",
    "dotted lines show the expected ratios if the galaxies had @xcite or @xcite imfs . in general @xmath1 will be a mix of stellar mass and dark halo mass , but as we argued in section [ s : data ] , the galaxies analyzed herein are sufficiently dense that @xmath1 is likely dominated by the stars .",
    "we also emphasize that @xmath46 and @xmath45 are completely independent in the sense that the former is derived from absorption line spectra while the latter is derived from a combination of @xmath8 , @xmath64 , @xmath0 , and the detailed light profile shape .",
    "furthermore , while formally the axes are correlated for the @xmath65 vs. @xmath0 relation ( @xmath66 ) , we have simulated the effect of measurement errors and find that the nominal measurement errors ( figure [ fig : prop ] ) have a small effect on the result . if the true random errors were as large as 0.05 dex , then half of the difference between the @xmath1 and @xmath67 relations could be explained by the correlated axes in the former relation .",
    "the key result is that @xmath65 and @xmath68 , and their variation with @xmath0 , agree very well , perhaps even better than expected given expected systematic errors that could plausibly exceed 0.1 dex .",
    "in addition , both masses point toward an imf that becomes increasingly bottom - heavy with increasing @xmath0 . at the highest dispersions",
    "the inferred imf becomes considerably steeper than even the salpeter imf .",
    "we emphasize that not only were the dynamical , photometric and spectroscopic masses derived for the same set of galaxies , but they were also derived for data obtained within the exact same aperture , i.e. , the ( seeing - convolved ) sdss fiber .",
    "figure [ fig : res ] therefore presents the most direct comparison of spectral and dynamically - based imf results to - date .",
    "we caution that the quantitative trend shown here for our sample of 1100 compact early - type galaxies may not to be representative of the entire early - type galaxy population , and in fact there are emerging clues that galaxy compactness may be an important variable governing the imf shape @xcite . in a forthcoming analysis",
    "we will explore the two dimensional manifold of imf variation as a function of @xmath0 and galaxy compactness ( e.g. , @xmath69 and/or @xmath8 ) .",
    "the fact that the same imf variation is seen both via dynamical and sps - based techniques is reassuring and suggests that neither technique suffers from catastrophic systematic errors .",
    "however , we caution that consistency does not necessarily imply that both techniques are correct , as independent systematic errors in the mass measurements could work in the same direction . addressing possible sources of systematic uncertainty",
    "is the subject of ongoing work ."
