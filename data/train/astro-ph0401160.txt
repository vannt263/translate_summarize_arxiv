    "the linear decomposition of an astronomical dataset into a series of basis functions is a fundamental task in many areas of astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "indeed , in the analysis of one - dimensional spectra , two - dimensional images or higher - dimensional datasets , one is often faced with the problem of determining the coefficients in a linear expansion of the dataset in some set of ( sampled ) basis functions . to illustrate our discussion , we will focus here on the important specific example of decomposing a two - dimensional astronomical image , although the general approach that we advocate will be applicable to datasets of arbitrary dimensionality .",
    "the description of a digitised image as a linear combination of a set of sampled basis functions is an everyday problem for astronomers .",
    "for example , one often describes an image in terms of a set of orthogonal fourier modes by calculating the coefficients in the expansion using a discrete fourier transform .",
    "significant attention has also been given to representing an image as a linear combination of discrete wavelets basis functions , both orthogonal and non - orthogonal ( see , for instance , hobson et al .",
    "1999 ; sanz et al 1999a;b ; tenorio et al .",
    "more recently , several authors have investigated the use of gaussian - hermite modes ( or shapelets ) in representing images of galaxies ( refregier 2003 ; refregier & bacon 2003 ) .",
    "although such image decompostion is commonplace , there exist a number of subtleties in the procedure that are not widely appreciated within the astronomical community .",
    "these include the effect of digitisation , or sampling , on familiar notions from the analytic theory of continuous functions , in particular the concepts of completeness and linear independence of sampled basis functions , and the use of non - orthogonal bases .    in this paper , we therefore discuss a general mathematical framework for the linear decomposition of an astronomical image into a set of arbitrary sampled functions ( or modes ) .",
    "these may , in general , form a ` basis ' that is non - orthogonal and either under - complete , perfectly - complete or over - complete . in the under - complete case , the modes do not support all the degrees of freedom in an arbitrary image . by perfectly - complete",
    "we mean that the modes supports all the degrees of freedom without linear dependence between them , whereas for an over - complete mode set there are additional modes relative to the complete case and hence linear dependence in the set .",
    "in particular , we show how to quantify those degrees of freedom in an image that can be supported by any particular mode set , and we explicitly consider how to obtain the optimal set of mode coefficients for representing the image .",
    "these methods present an opportunity for the optimisation of sampling within modal analysis , ensuring that computational operations are reduced to a minimum .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ modal ]",
    ", we outline the modal decomposition problem and present a general prescription for obtaining optimal results , which is based on the singular value decomposition of the matrix of digitised mode vectors . in section  [ one - dim ] , we illustrate our general approach by investigating the decomposition of simple one - dimensional function into gauss - hermite ( shapelet ) modes . this investigation is pursued further in section  [ imagedecomp ] , where we consider the decomposition of images of hubble deep field galaxies into two - dimensional gauss - laguerre ( polar shapelet ) modes . finally , our conclusions are presented in section  [ conc ] .",
    "consider a 2-d digitised image consisting of @xmath0 pixels , which we denote by the @xmath0-dimensional column vector @xmath1 .",
    "our goal is to represent the image , as accurately as possible , in terms of a set of @xmath2 ( two - dimensional ) modes @xmath3 @xmath4 defined at the same points at which @xmath1 is sampled ; thus each @xmath5 is also a column vector of length @xmath0 .",
    "it is convenient to combine the mode vectors into the single @xmath6 mode matrix defined by @xmath7.\\ ] ] our objective is thus to determine a suitable coefficient vector @xmath8 that minimises the residual @xmath9 note that we make no requirement for the mode vectors to be mutually orthogonal , linearly independent , or of unit length .",
    "several cases may arise in this problem .",
    "there may exist a unique coefficient vector @xmath8 that minimises ( [ residualdef ] ) ; this corresponds to the quantity @xmath10",
    "possessing a single well - defined multi - dimensional quadratic minimum in the space of coefficients @xmath11 . surfaces of constant @xmath10 are given by the hermitian form @xmath12 , where @xmath13 ( which is called the gram matrix ) .",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath14 determine the principal directions of this multi - dimensional ellipsoid , and the extent along each principal direction is inversely proportional to the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "if there exist approximate degeneracies in the coefficient - space , some of the eigenvalues become very small and so the multi - dimensional ellipsoid is considerably elongated in these directions ; this leads to a wide range of coefficients vectors @xmath11 for which @xmath15 takes its minimum value to within the numerical precision . in the limiting case of exact degeneracies",
    ", some eigenvalues are identically zero leading to an infinite extent for the ` ellipsoid ' along the corresponding principal directions . in the subspace spanned by these directions",
    "the value of @xmath15 takes its minimum value precisely . in either of the last two cases , to the numerical precision , there exist an infinite number of possible coefficient vectors @xmath8 that minimise ( [ residualdef ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath16 is also of central importance . clearly , if @xmath17 , then the modal expansion @xmath18 provides an exact representation of the original image , whereas if @xmath19 it represents only an approximation to @xmath1 .    which of the above cases occurs is dependent on the completeness and linear dependence of the mode set @xmath20 , and on the particular image @xmath1 being decomposed . clearly , if the @xmath21 then the modes are ` under - complete ' , and so can not represent an arbitrary image , but only an approximation to it .",
    "this may also occur when @xmath22 , however , since the modes may still not form a complete basis as a result of linear dependence between them . nevertheless , even with an under - complete set , the particular image @xmath1 under analysis may lie in the subspace spanned by the modes , and so may be represented exactly .",
    "when @xmath22 cases arise where the modes form a complete basis , in which any image can be represented exactly . in this case , if @xmath23 the modes must linearly independent and form a ` perfectly - complete ' basis . if @xmath24 , some linear dependence must exist between the modes and they form an ` over - complete ' basis .",
    "in general , the degree of completeness of the chosen mode set may not be known at the outset .",
    "fortunately , a straightforward technique exists for determining the degree of completeness of the mode set , and simultaneously determining an ` appropriate ' coefficient vector @xmath8 that minimises ( [ residualdef ] ) .",
    "this is achieved by performing the singular - value decomposition ( svd ) of the mode matrix @xmath25 , which we now discuss .",
    "the svd of the @xmath6 mode matrix @xmath25 ( which may , in general , contain complex - valued entries ) may be written ( see , for example , golub & van loan 1992 ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 is unitary matrix of dimensions @xmath28 , @xmath29 is a unitary matrix of dimensions @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is a @xmath6 matrix ( the same dimensions as @xmath25 ) that is diagonal in the sense that @xmath32 for @xmath33 , where @xmath34 $ ] , and zero otherwise .",
    "the coefficients @xmath35 are the _ singular values _ of the matrix @xmath25 .    as is well - known",
    ", the number @xmath36 ( say ) of non - zero singular values is equal to the rank of @xmath25 , which in turn is the dimensionality of the image subspace that is spanned by the @xmath2 modes @xmath3 ; clearly it must be the case that @xmath37 and @xmath38 . the dimensionality of the nullspace of @xmath25 ( the subspace of vectors @xmath39 in the coefficient space for which @xmath40 ) is given by @xmath41 .",
    "it is thus a simple matter to determine the completeness of the mode set contained in @xmath25 as follows : ( i ) if @xmath42 the modes are under - complete ; ( ii ) if @xmath43 and @xmath23 the modes are perfectly complete ; and ( iii ) if @xmath43 and @xmath24 the modes are over - complete .",
    "moreover , it is straightforward to show that the columns of @xmath27 corresponding to non - zero singular values constitute an orthonormal basis for the range of @xmath25 , and the columns of @xmath29 that do not correspond to a non - zero singular value form an orthonormal basis for the nullspace . in practical numerical problems ,",
    "it is often the case that none of the singular values @xmath35 are identically zero .",
    "instead , one usually sets to zero those singular values for which @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is some small factor ( for example , @xmath46 in single precision arithmetic ) and @xmath47 is the first ( and largest ) singular value .",
    "once the svd ( [ svddef ] ) has been calculated , it is also straightforward to obtain an ` appropriate ' coefficient vector @xmath8 that minimises ( [ residualdef ] ) .",
    "as we outline below , in all cases one should calculate the coefficient vector using @xmath48 where the @xmath49 matrix denoted by @xmath50 is constructed by taking the transpose of @xmath31 in ( [ svddef ] ) and replacing each non - zero singular value @xmath35 by @xmath51 .",
    "it is clear that , with the above construction , @xmath52 is an @xmath53 diagonal matrix with diagonal entries that equal unity for those values of @xmath54 for which @xmath55 , and zero otherwise . using this result",
    "it is straightforward to show that ( [ svdsoln ] ) does indeed minimise the residual ( [ residualdef ] ) . modifying slightly the argument of press et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , suppose we were to add to @xmath8 some arbitrary vector @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the part of the vector that lies in the nullspace of @xmath25 ( if one exists ) and @xmath58 is the part that lies in the complement to the nullspace .",
    "this would result in the addition of the vector @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "we would then have @xmath61\\vect{d}'| \\nonumber \\\\ & = & |(\\bg{\\sigma}\\overline{\\bg{\\sigma}}-\\vect{i } ) \\vect{u}^\\dagger\\vect{d}+\\vect{u}^\\dagger\\vect{d}'| , \\label{xminres}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the last line we have made use of the fact that the length of a vector is left unchanged under the action of the unitary matrix @xmath27 .",
    "now , the @xmath54th component of the vector @xmath62 will only be non - zero when @xmath63 .",
    "however , the @xmath54th element of the vector @xmath64 is non - zero only if @xmath55 , since @xmath65 lies in the range of @xmath25 .",
    "thus , as these two terms only contribute to ( [ xminres ] ) for two disjoint sets of @xmath54-values , its minimum value , as @xmath66 is varied , occurs when @xmath67 ; this requires @xmath68 .",
    "if the image @xmath1 lies in the subspace spanned by the @xmath2 modes @xmath3 , then the minimum value of the residual ( [ residualdef ] ) is zero , and the image is represented exactly by @xmath18 .",
    "clearly , in order to represent an arbitrary image we require @xmath43 ( and so @xmath22 ) . if @xmath1 does not lie in the range of @xmath25 , then @xmath18 yields only an approximate representation of the image ( for this to occur , the modes must be under - complete ; this will always be true if @xmath21 , but may also occur when @xmath22 ) .    in either case , we see from the argument above that , if @xmath25 does not possess a null space , the coefficient vector ( [ svdsoln ] ) is unique in minimising the residual ( [ residualdef ] ) . the condition for this to occur",
    "is that @xmath69 , indicating that the @xmath2 modes are linearly independent ( and hence requiring @xmath70 ) .",
    "if @xmath25 does possess a nullspace , however , any vector @xmath57 in this nullspace can be added to ( [ svdsoln ] ) , without changing the value of the residual .",
    "thus there are an infinite number of coefficient vectors that minimise ( [ residualdef ] ) . the condition for this to occur",
    "is that @xmath71 , indicating linear dependence between the modes ( which may occur for @xmath70 and @xmath24 ) .    in the case where @xmath72 possesses a nullspace , from the infinite number of coefficient vectors that minimise the residual ( [ residualdef ] ) ,",
    "the vector @xmath8 in ( [ svdsoln ] ) is that which contains no contribution from the nullspace .",
    "an equivalent statement is that ( [ svdsoln ] ) is the vector of shortest length that minimises ( [ residualdef ] ) .",
    "consider again adding some arbitrary vector @xmath66 to ( [ svdsoln ] ) .",
    "the length of the resulting vector is @xmath73 where in the last line we again make use of the fact that the length of a vector is left unchanged under the action of a unitary matrix .",
    "the @xmath54th component of the vector @xmath74 will only be non - zero when @xmath55 , whereas the @xmath54th element of the vector @xmath75 is non - zero only if @xmath76 .",
    "thus the minimum length vector has @xmath77 .",
    "although the appropriate coefficient vector may always be obtained straightforwardly from ( [ svdsoln ] ) , it is conceptually appealing to consider coefficient @xmath78 as the scalar product of the image vector @xmath1 with some new mode vector @xmath79 that is dual to the original mode @xmath5 .",
    "in other words , it is often convenient to rewrite ( [ svdsoln ] ) as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the @xmath6 dual mode matrix , which contains the @xmath2 dual mode vectors as its columns , i.e. @xmath82.\\ ] ] from ( [ svdsoln ] ) , we see immediately that the dual mode matrix is given in terms of the svd of the original mode matrix by @xmath83 thus , once a mode set has been defined , the dual mode set can be calculated directly by performing a svd , without reference to any image .",
    "the coefficients for any particular image are then quickly obtained using ( [ dualssoln ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that , in general , @xmath84 where we now start to place subscripts on identity matrices to emphasise their dimensionality .",
    "it is only in the case where the original mode set is complete that @xmath85 , from which it is a simple matter to verify that @xmath86 this , of course , corresponds to the case in which an arbitrary image @xmath1 can be represented exactly , since then @xmath87 otherwise only an approximation to the original image is possible .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that , in general , @xmath88 in other words , the dual modes do _ not _ necessarily obey the standard orthogonality condition @xmath89 with the original mode set .",
    "this orthogonality condition is only satisfied if the original mode set is linearly - independent ( for which @xmath69 and hence @xmath90 ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath91 , from which one quickly finds that @xmath92 , which recovers the standard result that the dual modes form the reciprocal basis of the original mode set .",
    "this corresponds to the case where ( [ dualssoln ] ) is unique in minimising the residual ( [ residualdef ] ) . if , in addition , we have @xmath23 and so the basis perfectly complete , @xmath25 is invertible and it follows that @xmath93 .",
    "we reiterate , however , that all possible cases are automatically accommodated using svd .",
    "so far , we have imposed no restrictions on the orthogonality , normalisation or the number of members of our original mode set @xmath3 .",
    "it is worth investigating , however , the simplifications that occur in the case where the modes are mutually orthogonal and each mode is unique ( so @xmath70 ) .",
    "hence , we have @xmath94 .    in this case , the mode set is automatically linearly - independent and so the coefficient vector ( [ svdsoln ] ) or ( [ dualssoln ] ) is unique in minimising the residual .",
    "moreover , the dual modes and original modes obey the standard orthogonality condition @xmath92 . in the case of orthogonal modes ,",
    "it is clear that , in addition , this condition is satisfied if the dual modes are given by @xmath95 thus , for orthogonal modes ( even with @xmath21 ) , we see that each dual is simply proportional to the original mode . in the event that the original modes are normalised to unit length , this proportionality becomes an equality , and the dual modes are identical to the original modes , so that @xmath96 and hence @xmath97 this last result is , of course , the reason for the common practice , in the case of orthonormal modes , of calculating the @xmath98th mode coefficient @xmath78 by simply evaluating the scalar product of the image @xmath1 with the @xmath98th mode @xmath5 .",
    "of course , when @xmath23 , a set of orthogonal modes also forms a perfectly complete basis .      throughout our discussion",
    ", we have adopted the practical approach of working with finite dimensional vectors , rather than continous functions .",
    "thus , both the image @xmath1 and the modes @xmath5 are considered simply as @xmath0-dimensional vectors .",
    "this allows the direct application of our approach to a wide variety problems in the decomposition of digital astronomical images .",
    "the image pixel values @xmath99 correspond to samples of the underlying continuous distribution @xmath100 at a particular set of points @xmath101 . in practice , it is most often the case that sample points are regularly spaced , but this restriction is not necessary .",
    "the entire approach can just as easily be applied to the case where the pixels values correspond to samples that are not regularly spaced . in an analogous manner ,",
    "the elements of each mode vector @xmath5 are the sample values from some underlying continuous mode function @xmath102 at the same set of points @xmath101 .",
    "it is clear that the positions of the sample points will have a profound effect on whether the linear - independence , orthogonality , or other properties of the original set of continuous mode functions @xmath103 are inherited by the mode vectors @xmath3 .",
    "consider , for example , a set of continuous mode functions @xmath103 that are orthonormal over some continuous domain @xmath104 , so that @xmath105 even in the case where the sample points @xmath101 are evenly spaced , the spacing between them and the extent of the domain @xmath106 that is sampled are important in determining whether the corresponding mode vectors @xmath3 are orthonormal . indeed , as we shall see below , in some applications it is common for the corresponding mode vectors _ not _ to be orthonormal .",
    "if this is the case , then it is is no longer true that the dual mode vectors are identical to the original mode vectors , and so it is incorrect to calculate the coefficient vector @xmath8 using ( [ standardsoln ] ) , i.e. by taking the scalar product of the data @xmath1 with the mode vectors .",
    "this will lead to a modal decomposition of the image that is unnecessarily inaccurate .",
    "instead , one must return to using the general result ( [ dualssoln ] ) , where the mode coefficients are calculated by taking the scalar product of the data with the corresponding dual mode vectors .    finally , a crucial point is that the converse may also occur .",
    "for example , if a set of continous mode functions are not orthogonal , by sampling them at a particular set of ( non - uniform ) points one can arrive at a set of mode vectors that are orthogonal , in which case the duals are trivially obtained .",
    "although the main focus of this paper is the modal decompostion of two - dimensional astronomical images , it will be informative first to illustrate the discussion given above by investigating the decompostion of one - dimensional sampled functions ( which may be considered as cuts through some image ) .",
    "in particular , we will focus our numerical investigations in this section on decompostions using one - dimensional gaussian - hermite ( or shapelet ) mode functions , as recently advocated by refregier ( 2003 ) for representing images of galaxies .    in this case ,",
    "the continuous mode functions are given by @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "the quantity @xmath109 is some fixed ` characteristic scale ' for the set of mode functions and the function @xmath110 reads @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a hermite polynomial of order @xmath98 . from these expressions",
    "it is clear that the mode functions are real and that @xmath109 is equal to the dispersion ` @xmath113 ' of the @xmath114 gaussian mode function .",
    "it is also straightforward to show that the mode functions are orthonormal over the domain @xmath115 , i.e. @xmath116 we note that , for convenience , the mode functions are centred at @xmath117 .",
    "it is , of course , possible to centre them about some arbitrary point @xmath118 , but in most cases the coordinate system is chosen so that the centroid of the galaxy image ( say ) is located at the origin .",
    "the first six mode functions are shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] for @xmath119 .",
    "let us now consider the decomposition of a one - dimensional pixelised ` image ' into shapelets . in any such decomposition ,",
    "one is free to choose both the characteristic scale @xmath109 of the modes set and the total number @xmath2 of modes used ( note that @xmath120 ) . as shown by refregier ( 2003 ) , such a set of shapelet modes is suitable for describing features in an image on scales between the two limits @xmath121 thus , if the image has features on scales ranging from @xmath122 ( e.g. the pixel size or the size of the point spread function ) to @xmath123 ( e.g. the size of the image or the overall extent of the structure it contains ) , then a good choice of @xmath109 and @xmath2 is @xmath124 for each of the pixelised test images we consider below , we take the coordinate positions of the @xmath0 ( regularly - spaced ) sample points to be @xmath125 thereby giving an image of spatial extent of @xmath0 , with a pixel size of unity . in each case , we take @xmath126 . taking into account that our test images contain structure on the order of the image size , but do not contain structure on scales less than a few pixels , acceptable choices for the scale parameter and the number of modes to use are @xmath127 and @xmath128 . for convenience ,",
    "we fix @xmath129 , and investigate mode sets for which @xmath130  20 in steps of unity . in each case",
    ", the elements of the corresponding pixelised mode vectors are easily calculated from @xmath131 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plot the elements of the first six mode vectors for @xmath119 .",
    "we see that , even for this modest value of @xmath109 , the support of the mode vectors for @xmath132 exceeds the length of the image .",
    "indeed , as @xmath98 increases the support of the mode vectors increases according to ( [ scalesdef ] ) , and so this effect becomes extremely pronounced for the high-@xmath98 modes . as a result , we would expect the mode set does not satisfy the discretized form of the orthogonality condition ( [ orthogdef ] ) .",
    "we will show below that this is indeed the case .",
    "it is also of interest to investigate the structure of the mode vectors for different values of @xmath109 . as an illustration , in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot the highest-@xmath98 mode vector in the set ( @xmath133 ) for six different values of the scale parameter @xmath109 .",
    "in particular , we note that the mode vector is severely undersampled for @xmath134 and @xmath135 , in which case the mode set may again fail to be orthogonal .",
    "moreover , since the highest-@xmath98 mode in the set has the largest spatial extent , we see that , in fact , for @xmath136 the support of the mode set exceeds the length of the image , once again suggesting a loss of orthogonality .",
    "since we have chosen @xmath137 , the mode vectors clearly can not form a complete basis for the image space .",
    "nevertheless , it is of interest to investigate formally the linear - dependence and orthogonality of the mode vectors @xmath5 @xmath138 for various values of the scale parameter @xmath109 . to this end , for each value of @xmath109 under consideration , we construct the corresponding mode matrix @xmath25 and then determine its rank @xmath36 by calculating its svd and counting the number of non - zero singular values . if the mode vectors are linearly independent , one would expect @xmath69 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we plot the value of @xmath36 as a function of the parameter @xmath109 .    since the number of mode vectors is @xmath139 , we see that the mode vectors form a linearly - independent @xmath140 set only if the scale parameter lies in the range @xmath14111 . for smaller values of @xmath109",
    ", the undersampling of the underlying continuous mode functions leads to linear dependence in the resulting mode set . for large @xmath109 ,",
    "linear dependence occurs since the support of ( some of ) the mode vectors exceeds the length of the image .    to investigate whether the mode vectors are orthonormal we calculate the gram matrix @xmath142 for each value of @xmath109 under consideration",
    ". clearly , for an orthonormal set of mode vectors would expect @xmath143 . in fig  [ fig5 ] ( top ) ,",
    "for each value of @xmath109 , we plot the logarithms of the largest and smallest diagonal elements of @xmath14 . for mode vectors of unit length",
    ", we would expect all the diagonal elements to equal unity , and so the two plotted curves should coincide at @xmath144 .",
    "we see that this occurs only if the scale parameter lies in the range @xmath1456 .     +    in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we plot the value of the logarithm of the largest off - diagonal element of @xmath14 as a function of @xmath109 . for an orthogonal set of mode vectors , one would expect all the off - diagonal elements of @xmath14 to be zero in the ideal case , or below the machine precision in a numerical implementation .",
    "we see that this is only the case if @xmath1454 , although the off - diagonal elements remain reasonably small for @xmath1466 . for other values of @xmath109 , however , we see that there exist off diagonal elements with absolute values greater than @xmath147 , which is a clear indication that the corresponding mode sets are not orthogonal .",
    "we also note that there exist values of @xmath109 for which the modes are non - orthogonal , but still have full rank .      since for mode sets with @xmath148 or @xmath149 the mode vectors are not orthogonal ,",
    "the corresponding dual mode vectors are not simply some multiple of the original modes .",
    "it is therefore of interest to investigate the form of the dual modes in these cases . as an illustration , in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we plot the first six dual mode vectors for the case @xmath119 .",
    "these should be compared with the corresponding original mode vectors plotted in fig .",
    "we see that the form of each dual is very different from the corresponding original mode vector .",
    "in particular , we note that the form of the duals is determined by the entire original mode set . as a result",
    ", the large spatial extent of the large-@xmath98 original mode vectors has an effect on the form of the low-@xmath98 dual mode vectors , even though the support of corresponding low-@xmath98 original mode vectors does not exceed the length of the image .",
    "thus , for example , the @xmath114 and @xmath150 dual vectors are markedly different from the correspondinig original mode vectors , even though the latter lie completely within the image length .",
    "although clear from the discussion in section  [ dualmodes ] , it is worth pointing out once more that the dual modes are _ not _ the basis set in terms of which an image is described . in the approach",
    "presented , the image is still represented as a linear combination of the original gauss - hermite ( or shapelet ) mode vectors .",
    "it is simply that the value of the coefficient @xmath151 in the linear combination is given by the scalar product of the image vector @xmath1 with the @xmath98th dual mode @xmath79 , rather than with the original mode vector @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the advantageous properties of the gauss - hermite modes ( or any other mode set under consideration ) can still be used in the analysis of the resulting modal decomposition . from fig.[fig6 ] , however , it is clear that the dual vectors may not possess the same localisation as the basis vector to which they relate .",
    "consequently , for the @xmath114 mode for example , a feature towards the edge of the field will affect the coefficients of the mode even though the original mode vector falls to zero there .",
    "now that we have discussed the properties of the mode vectors and their duals for various values of the scale parameter @xmath109 , it is of interest to investigate the effect of taking proper account of linear dependence and non - orthogonal . to this end",
    ", we perform the modal decomposition of some simple one - dimensional test functions using both the method advocated in section  [ svd ] and the standard approach in which the coefficients in the decompostion are obtained simply by taking scalar products of the image vector with the original mode vectors ( see e.g. refregier 2003 ) .",
    "the test functions considered , although simple , are relevant to the decomposition of astronomical images .",
    "we begin by considering the modal decomposition of a uniform signal .",
    "the issue of accommodating ( nearly ) uniform background emission is clearly relevant in an astronomical context .",

    "the minimum residual is identical for the two methods , since the original mode set is linear - independent and orthonormal to machine precision .",
    "our final one - dimensional illustration is that of a @xmath109-model profile .",

    "[ fig11 ] , we see again that the svd methods produces superior decompositions for the values of @xmath109 illustrated . for both methods ,",
    "some ringing is observed in the decompositions , but this is much less pronounced for the svd method . in particular , for large values of @xmath109 , the standard method can not accurately reproduce the narrow peak of the @xmath109-model , whereas this is achieved by the svd method .",

    "we now consider the modal decomposition of real two - dimensional astronomical images .",
    "these images were obtained by first using @xmath168 ( bertins & arnouts 1996 ) on the hubble deep fields ( hdfs ; williams et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "the convolution mask and detection parameters were adapted from those used by massey et al .",
    "in particular , in order to allow the recovery of faint objects , we adopted a low signal - to - noise detection threshold , detect_thresh , of 1.3 .",
    "objects with class_star @xmath169 97 per cent were discarded , since we wish to analyse only galaxies .",
    "the image was then segmented into small square ` postage stamp ' regions around the remaining galaxies .",
    "the size of the images were set to @xmath170 pixels . in this section ,",
    "we investigate the decomposition of the hdf galaxy images into a set of two - dimensional gaussian - laguerre modes .",
    "the two - dimensional gauss - laguerre continuous mode functions are the simultaneous eigenstates of energy and angular momentum for the two - dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "interestingly , these mode functions are also the solutions in polar coordinates to the paraxial wave equation in optics ( see e.g. goldsmith 1998 ) .",
    "the relationship between the standard forms of these mode functions used in the above contexts is discussed in detail in the appendix .    in the field of optical and quasi - optical systems , it is customary ( murphy et al .",
    "1996 ; withington et al .",
    "2000 ) to define the set of mode functions as @xmath171^{1/2 } x^{|m|/2 } \\mbox{e}^{-x/2 }   l_p^{|m|}(x)\\,\\mbox{e}^{\\mbox{i}m\\theta } , \\label{pm - decomp}\\ ] ] where @xmath172 and @xmath173 are the standard associated laguerre polynomials .",
    "the functions @xmath174 are conventionally called the gaussian beam @xmath175-modes or simply the @xmath175-modes ( see e.g. goldsmith 1998 ) and form an orthonormal set over the infinite euclidean plane .",
    "the radial index can take the values @xmath176 , and the azimuthal index @xmath177 can take the values @xmath178 . in practice , it is customary to truncate the mode set by imposing maximum values for @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "indeed , it is usual to choose @xmath181 , which leads to a total number of modes @xmath182 .",
    "if @xmath183 is real then clearly @xmath184 .    in the context of quantum mechanics , it is more usual to label the modes in terms of the energy quantum number @xmath185 and @xmath177 , rather than @xmath179 and @xmath177 .",
    "indeed , refregier ( 2003 ) uses this convention to arrive at the polar shapelet modes @xmath186^{1/2 } x^{|m|/2 } \\mbox{e}^{-x/2 }",
    "l_{\\frac{n-|m|}{2}}^{|m|}(x ) \\ , \\mbox{e}^{\\mbox{i}m\\theta } , \\label{nm - decomp}\\ ] ] which also form an orthonormal set over the infinite euclidean plane .",
    "the energy quantum number can take the values @xmath187 , and the azimuthal ( angular momentum ) quantum number takes the values @xmath188 , thereby giving @xmath189 values of @xmath177 for each value of @xmath190 . in practice ,",
    "one truncates the mode set by imposing a maximum value for @xmath190 , which leads to a total number of modes @xmath191 . once again , if @xmath183 is real , it is clear that @xmath192 .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion ( and that given in the appendix ) that the two decompositions ( [ pm - decomp ] ) and ( [ nm - decomp ] ) use very different combinations of gauss - laguerre modes .",
    "the question thus arises as to the relative merits of the two mode sets in decomposing a two - dimensional astronomical image .",
    "it is therefore of interest to investigate the properties of pixelised versions of these two mode sets .",
    "as shown by refregier ( 2003 ) , by analogy with the criteria ( [ criterion1 ] ) , the appropriate values of the scale parameter @xmath109 and the maximum energy quantum number @xmath193 for the polar shapelet mode set ( [ nm - decomp ] ) are given by @xmath194 for the decomposition of an image with features on scales ranging from @xmath195 to @xmath123 .",
    "the galaxy images to be decomposed are of size @xmath196 pixels , and contain structure down to scales of around 3 pixels . using the above criteria , we therefore choose @xmath197 .",
    "thus , the total number of polar shapelet modes is 190 . to allow a fair comparison between the polar shapelet and @xmath175-mode sets",
    ", one should arrange for the two sets to contain ( as close as possible ) the same total number of modes .",
    "fortunately , by choosing @xmath198 , one can arrange for the @xmath175-mode set also to contain @xmath199 modes .",
    "the corresponding @xmath175-mode and polar shapelet mode vectors are obtained by pixelising the continuous mode functions on the same grid as the galaxy images .",
    "each mode set contains only @xmath199 modes , which is clearly far less than the number of pixels in the image , but need not be less than the number of degrees of freedom in some class of images . for an arbitrary image of infinite resolution the number of degrees of freedom and",
    "pixels will be the same and both decompositions can only represent an approximation to the image .",
    "+   +    we may investigate the properties of the polar shapelet and @xmath175-mode sets in the same manner as we analysed the one - dimensional shapelet modes .",
    "to this end , for each integer value of @xmath109 in the range 020 , we construct the mode matrix @xmath25 for both the polar shapelets and @xmath175-modes .",
    "the rank @xmath36 of both matrices was found to equal the number of modes ( 190 ) for all values of @xmath109 under consideration , hence showing that both modes sets are linearly - independent in all cases . to investigate whether the mode vectors in each set are orthonormal , we calculate the gram matrix @xmath200 for each mode set for each value of @xmath109 . for an orthonormal mode set @xmath14 should equal the identity matrix . in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] ( top and middle ) , we plot the logarithm of the value of the largest and smallest diagonal element of @xmath14 for the two mode sets . we see that , for both mode sets , the two curves coincide at @xmath144 only for @xmath145 and 4 , and so it is only for these values of the scale parameter that the mode vectors are of unit length . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] , we plot the logarithm of the largest off - diagonal element of @xmath14 for the polar shapelet ( dashed line ) and @xmath175-mode set ( solid line ) .",
    "we see that , for each mode set , the largest off - diagonal element is only below the machine precision for @xmath153 , and so it is only for this case that either mode set is orthogonal .      for the galaxy images to be decomposed , the result ( [ 2dcrit ] ) suggests one should set @xmath201 for the polar shapelets ; for comparison purposes we will also use this value of the scale parameter for the @xmath175-mode set .    to investigate the relative merits of the two mode sets , we first consider the decomposition of the single galaxy image shown in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] ( left ) . in the middle panel ,",
    "we plot the decomposition residual using the standard approach for the polar shapelets ( dashed line ) and the @xmath175-modes ( solid line ) as a function of the total number of modes @xmath2 in the set . as expected , for both mode sets , the decomposition residual decreases as more modes are used .",
    "we also see , however , that , for the same total number of modes , the @xmath175-modes yield a slightly lower decomposition residual than the polar shapelets . in the right - hand panel of fig.[fig14 ] , plot the corresponding results obtained using the svd appraoch .",
    "it is clear that , for any given value of @xmath2 , the svd approach outperforms the standard approach .",
    "we also see that , once again , the @xmath175-modes yield a lower decomposition residual than the polar shapelets .",
    "the decomposition of five representative galaxy images into the @xmath175-mode set are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] , using both the standard technique ( middle column ) and the svd method ( right column ) .",
    "as anticipated , since the mode set is not orthogonal , the two decompositions differ , markedly in some cases . for each galaxy image ,",
    "however , we see that the svd method produces a more faithful reconstruction .",
    "in particular , we note that the svd method is more successful in reproducing the finer detail of the image .",
    "by contrast , the decompositions obtained using the standard approach contain structure only on larger scales .",
    "a quantitative comparison of the decomposition quality is given in table  [ tab1 ] , which lists the values of the residual @xmath15 of the decomposition .",
    "as expected , in each case the svd method produces a more accurate decomposition than the standard method .",
    "we have discussed a general method for performing optimal image decomposition into a set of arbitrary digitised mode functions , which is an everyday problem in astronomy .",
    "our approach may be applied straightforwardly even if the modes are linearly - dependent , non - orthogonal or incomplete , although in the last case the decomposition can only , in general , approximate the original image . by constructing the matrix @xmath25 containing the digitised modes ,",
    "the properties of the mode set can be easily obtained by performing a singular value decomposition ( svd ) . moreover , having obtained the svd , the optimal values for the coefficients in the linear decomposition can be obtained immediately . if desired , the optimal coefficients may also be obtained by constructing the set of dual modes , and performing scalar products of these duals with the input data vector .",
    "this should be contrasted with the standard method of taking scalar products of the original mode vector with the data vector .",
    "this latter approach yields optimal results only in the case where the digitised mode vectors form an orthonormal set .",
    "in particular , we note that the digitisation process itself may lead to a mode set that does not inherit the properties of the continuous mode functions from which they are derived .",
    "therefore , considerable care must be exercised when one performs decompositions using digitised versions of continous mode functions that form orthonormal sets .",
    "adopting the standard approach without first investigating the properties of the digitised modes can lead to unnecessarily inaccurate image decompositions .",
    ".the residuals @xmath15 of the decompositions of the galaxy images shown in fig.[fig13 ] for the standard method and the svd method . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we illustrate our general approach by first applying it to the decomposition of simple one - dimensional functions into gauss - hermite ( shapelet ) modes .",
    "we show that , although the continuous shapelet mode functions form an orthonormal set on the entire real line , the corresponding digitised mode vectors can be linearly - dependent and non - orthogonal , depending on the relative values of between the scale parameter @xmath109 , the pixel size and the size of the image under analysis .",
    "we show that , for a wide range of these values , the method developed here produces decompositions that are significantly superior to those of the standard approach . in some cases ,",
    "the decomposition residual for our method is many orders of magnitude lower than that for the standard technique .",
    "we also illustrate our method by decomposing images of galaxies extracted from the hubble deep fields into two - dimensional gauss - laguerre modes .",
    "we consider both the polar shapelet approach where the modes are indexed using the energy and angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath190 and @xmath177 , and the @xmath175-modes used in optics , which are indexed by a radial number @xmath179 and azimuthal number @xmath177 . in both cases , although the set of continuous functions is orthonormal over the entire euclidean plane , the correspondinig digitised modes can be severely non - orthogonal , depending on the relative sizes of the mode functions , the image size and the pixel scale .",
    "we show that the svd method proposed here again outperforms the standard approach , yielding more faithful decompositions with lower residuals .",
    "we would therefore advise that in future applications of the shapelet decomposition method , the standard approach should be replaced with that presented here .",
    "we also find that the @xmath175-mode set provides consistently more accurate decompositions than the polar shapelets .",
    "the decompositions presented in this paper used the svd to provide an optimal decomposition for individual images . frequently in astronomy , an analysis of the statistics of a collection of images is used to classify astronomical sources and properties .",
    "for such an application it may be desirable to use the duals method we have presented . in this case , the set of dual vectors can be calculated using a svd , without reference to any image .",
    "the expansion coefficients for each image can then be very efficiently calculated by performing scalar products with the duals .",
    "additionally , at this stage , a priori knowledge can be used ( if desired ) to constrain the duals to preferentially extract certain features from any image .",
