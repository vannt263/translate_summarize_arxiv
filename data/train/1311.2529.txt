    "@xcite , called this result `` deep and disconcerting . ''",
    "part of grothendieck s fascination with bely s theorem was a consequence of the simple combinatorial and topological characterization that follows from it . given a bely  map @xmath7 , the preimage @xmath8)$ ] of the real interval @xmath9 $ ] can be given the structure of a dessin ( or dessin denfant , `` child s drawing '' ) : a connected graph with bicolored vertices ( so the two vertices of an edge are colored differently ) equipped with a cyclic ordering of the edges around each vertex .",
    "conversely , a dessin determines the corresponding bely  map uniquely up to isomorphism over @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",

    "since there are only three permutation triples with the given ramification passport , we see that we have found all dessins of the given ramification type , so we need not consider the other cases further .",

    "stephenson @xcite , with a corresponding java script ` circlepack ` available for calculations .    given a dessin ( i.e. , the topological data underlying a bely  map ) , one obtains a triangulation of the underlying surface by taking the inverse image of @xmath389 together with the corresponding cell decomposition . choosing isomorphisms between these triangle and the standard equilateral triangle in @xmath2 and gluing appropriately ,",
    "one recovers the riemann surface structure and as a result a meromorphic description of the bely  map .",

    "to motivate this construction , note that a riemann surface structure on a compact surface induces a unique metric of constant curvature @xmath390 ( according as @xmath391 ) so that one can then speak meaningfully about circles on such a surface .",
    "in particular , it makes sense to ask whether or not there exists a circle packing associated with the triangulation , a pattern of circles centered at the vertices of this triangulation satisfying the tangency condition suggested by the triangulation .",
    "satisfyingly enough , the circle packing theorem , due koebe  andreev ",
    "thurston @xcite , states that given a triangulation of a topological surface , there exists a unique structure of riemann surface that leads to a compatible circle packing .",
    "this then realizes the topological map to the riemann sphere as a smooth function .    in summary , starting with a dessin ,",
    "one obtains a triangulation and hence a circle packing .",
    "the corresponding discrete bely  map will in general _ not _ be meromorphic for the riemann surface structure induced by the circle packing ; but bowers and stephenson prove that it does converge to the correct solution as the triangulation is iteratively hexagonally refined .",

    "fortunately , this is indeed possible ; work by collins ",
    "stephenson @xcite and mohar @xcite give algorithms for this .",
    "the crucial step is to lift the configuration of circles to the universal cover @xmath101 ( which is either the sphere @xmath392 , the plane @xmath2 , or the upper half - plane @xmath393 ) and perform the calculation in @xmath101 . in fact , this means that the circle packing method also explicitly solves the uniformization problem for the surface involved ; for theoretical aspects , we refer to beardon ",
    "stephenson @xcite . upon passing to @xmath101 and using the appropriate geometry , one then _ first _ calculates the radii of the circles involved from the combinatorics , before fitting the result into @xmath101 , where it gives rise to a fundamental domain for the corresponding curve as a quotient of @xmath101 .",

    "does the zipper method extend to higher genus ?    in the latter extension , one would need to consider not only the convergence of the bely  map but also the associated bely  curve @xmath1 , so it appears one will have to do more than simply solve the dirichlet problem .",

    "this map will then necessarily not be isomorphic to any of its proper conjugates .    on top of all this",

    "this distinction also measures the descent obstruction for hyperelliptic curves , as in work of lercier  ritzenthaler  sijsling @xcite .",
    "for bely  maps , a deep study of this problem in genus @xmath10 , beyond the general theory , was undertaken by couveignes @xcite : he shows that for the clean trees , those bely  maps with a single point over @xmath176 and only ramification index @xmath92 over @xmath26 , on the set of which @xmath623 acts faithfully , the field of moduli is always a field of definition in the strong sense .",

    "these considerations have practical value in the context of computations .",
    "for example , couveignes @xcite first exhibits a genus @xmath10 bely  map that descends explicitly to @xmath167 in the strong sense .",

    ", we will illustrate some of the subtleties that arise when considering fields of moduli .",
    "as we will see , these subtleties correspond with very natural questions on the level of computation .",
    "since @xmath692 is a subgroup of @xmath612 of index @xmath92 , we also obtain from this example a bely  map with indices @xmath693 for the group @xmath532 by taking the corresponding quotient .",
    "indeed , ramification can only occur over the points of order @xmath92 and @xmath147 , which means that in fact the cover is a cyclic degree @xmath92 map of conics ramifying of order @xmath92 over these points and under which the point of order @xmath516 has two preimages .",
    "an equation for this cover ( which is a bely  map ) can now be found by drawing an appropriate square root of the function @xmath694 ( which indeed ramifies of order @xmath147 over @xmath176 and of order @xmath92 over @xmath10 ) and sending the resulting preimages @xmath695 of the point of order @xmath516 to @xmath10 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "alternatively , we can calculate as follows .",
    "the full ring of invariant homogeneous polynomials for @xmath532 ( acting linearly by permutation of coordinates ) is generated by the power sums @xmath696 and the vandermonde polynomial @xmath697 one easily determines the expression for @xmath698 in terms of the @xmath344 ; setting @xmath699 , we get the relation @xmath700 this suggests that to get a function realizing the quotient @xmath701 , we take the map @xmath702 , where @xmath81 is the conic @xmath703 and @xmath117 is given by @xmath704 note that @xmath289 admits the rational point @xmath705 .",
    "this result is not as strong as one would like .",
    "as we have seen when calculating the full quotient @xmath19 , the branch points of @xmath117 of order @xmath516 on @xmath81 satisfy @xmath706 .",
    "but the corresponding points are only defined over @xmath707 , so this is a descent of a bely  map in the weak sense .",
    "we explain at the group - theoretical level what other kinds of descent can be expected .",
    "there are actually two galois covers with ramification indices @xmath708 for @xmath532 up to isomorphism .",
    "the other cover is not found as a subcover of @xmath19 ; when composing with the same quadratic map , we instead get a galois bely map whose galois group is the direct product of @xmath532 and @xmath709 .",
    "the corresponding curve is given by taking the hyperelliptic cover ramified over the vertices of an icosahedron , leading to the equation @xmath710    in particular , this means that the galois orbit of these covers consists of a single isomorphism class , as their monodromy groups upon composition differ @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , an @xmath532-bely  map , considered as a mere bely  map , is defined over its field of moduli as a bely  map , so our equations above can be twisted to a bely  map over @xmath167 , that is , with ramification at three rational points .",
    "however , the galois cover does _ not _ descend as an @xmath532-bely  map ( so in the strong sense , as a galois cover unramified outside @xmath711 ) .",
    "indeed , the character table of @xmath532 is only defined over @xmath707 . twisting",
    "may therefore give a cover defined over @xmath167 , but the galois action will then only be defined over @xmath707 and be accordingly more complicated .",
    "we therefore forgo this calculation and content ourselves with the symmetric form above .    for more on the questions considered in this section ,",
    "see also further work by couveignes @xcite , and in a similar vein , the work of van hoeij ",

    "admittedly , this subject is a delicate one , and we hope that computations will help to further clarify these nuances .",
    "once a potential model for a bely  map has been computed , it often remains to simplify the model as much as possible and to verify its correctness ( independently of the method used to compute it ) .",

    "2 .   if @xmath1 is of strictly positive genus , we mean to simplify the defining equations for @xmath1 .",

    "problem ( 1 ) is directly related with problem ( 2 ) for hyperelliptic curves , since simplifying the equations for hyperelliptic curves over a field @xmath24 boils down to finding a small representative of the @xmath712-orbit of a binary form .",
    "typically one also requires the defining equation to have integral coefficients .",

    "in fact , corresponding results for the simplification of bely  maps can be obtained by taking the binary form to be the product of the numerator and denominator of the bely  map . that the resulting binary form may have double roots and hence may not correspond to hyperelliptic curves is no problem",

    "this method works well if @xmath51 has small index in @xmath14 .",
    "iterating , this allows on to compute the monodromy group of a bely  map explicitly instead of merely giving the maximal groups in which is it included .",
    "to this end , one may work modulo a prime @xmath512 of good reduction , and in light of beckmann s theorem , we may still reasonably expect a small prime of the ring of integers of @xmath24 that is coprime with the cardinality @xmath718 of the monodromy group to do the job .",
    "second , one can compute the monodromy by using numerical approximation .",
    "this has been implemented by van hoeij @xcite , though one must be very careful to do this with rigorous error bounds .",
    "this idea was used by granboulan @xcite in the computation of a cover with galois group @xmath719 , first realized ( without explicit equation ) by malle",
    " matzat ( * ? ? ?",
    "* iii.7.5 ) .",
    "in particular , schneps @xcite describes a numerical method to draw the dessin itself , from which one can read off the mondromy .",
    "this method is further developed by bartholdi ",
    "von bothmer ",
    "krker @xcite , who lift a delaunay triangulation numerically and read off the permutations by traversing the sequence of edges counterclockwise around a basepoint .",
    "in particular this solves ( iii ) : if we express each of the complex solutions obtained by embedding @xmath720 , we may also want to know which cover corresponds to which permutation triple up to conjugation .",
    "a third and final method is due to elkies @xcite , who uses an effective version ( due to weil s proof of the riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields ) of the chebotarev density theorem in the function field setting .",
    "this was applied to distinguish whether the galois group of a given cover was equal to @xmath398 or @xmath721 .",
    "more precisely , one relies on reduction modulo a prime whose residue field is prime of sufficiently large characteristic ( in his case , @xmath722 ) and uses the resulting distribution of cycle structures to deduce that the cover was actually @xmath398 .",
    "this method has the advantage of using exact arithmetic and seems particularly well - suited to verify monodromy of large index in @xmath14 .",
    "this section discuss some subjects that are generalizations of or otherwise closely related with bely  maps . at the end , we briefly discuss the theoretical complexity of calculating bely  maps .      over @xmath723 , one can consider the reduction of bely  maps from characteristic @xmath10 ; this is considered in section [ sec : padic ] above .",
    "switching instead to global function fields might be interesting , especially if one restricts to tame ramification and compares with the situation in characteristic @xmath10 . as a generalization of bely s theorem , over a perfect field of characteristic @xmath724",
    ", every curve @xmath1 has a map to @xmath68 that is ramified only at @xmath176 by work of katz @xcite . but this map is necessarily wildly ramified at @xmath176 if @xmath725 , so the corresponding theory will differ essentially from that of bely  maps over @xmath3 .",
    "if we view bely s theorem as the assertion that every curve over a number field is an tale cover of @xmath726 , the moduli space of genus @xmath10 curves with @xmath156 marked points , then bely s result generalizes to a question by braungardt @xcite : is every connected , quasi - projective variety @xmath1 over @xmath3 birational to a finite tale cover of some moduli space of curves @xmath727 ?",
    "easton and vakil also have proven that the absolute galois group acts faithfully on the irreducible components of the moduli space of surfaces @xcite .",
    "surely some computations in small dimensions and degree will be just as appealing as in the case of bely  maps .",
    "as mentioned on a naive level in remarks [ rmk : naive1 ] and [ rmk : naive2 ] , another more general way to look at bely  maps is through the theory of hurwitz schemes , which give a geometric structure to the set @xmath728 parametrizing degree @xmath110 morphisms to @xmath68 over @xmath167 that are ramified above @xmath729 points .",
    "the theorem of bely  then amounts to saying that by taking the curve associated to a morphism , one obtains a surjective map from the union of the @xmath730-rational points of the spaces @xmath731 to the union of the @xmath730-rational points of the moduli spaces of curves @xmath244 of genus @xmath117 .",
    "we refer to work of romagny ",
    "wewers @xcite for a more complete account",
    ".      one generalization of bely  maps is given by covers called origamis : covers of elliptic curves that are unramified away from the origin .",
    "for a more complete account on origamis , see herrlich  schmithsen @xcite ; bely  maps can be obtained from origamis by a degeneration process @xcite .",
    "the reasons for considering origamis are many .",
    "first , the fundamental group of an elliptic curve minus a point is analogous to that of the riemann sphere , in that it is again free on two generators .",
    "the ramification type above the origin is now given by the image of the commutator of these two generators .",
    "the local information at this single point of ramification reflects less information about the cover than in the case of bely  maps .",
    "additionally , the base curve can be varied , which makes the subject more subtle , as teichmller theory makes its appearance .",
    "an exciting family of special origamis was considered by anema ",
    "top @xcite : they consider the elliptic curve @xmath732 over the scheme @xmath733 defined by the constant non - vanishing discriminant @xmath26 of @xmath75 . considering",
    "the torsion subschemes @xmath734 $ ] over @xmath735 , one obtains a family of covers over the base elliptic curve @xmath735 of @xmath32-invariant @xmath10 that is only ramified above the point at infinity and whose galois groups are subgroups of special linear groups",
    ". it would be very interesting to deform this family to treat the case of arbitrary base curves , though it is not clear how to achieve this .",
    "explicit examples of actual families of origamis were found by rubinstein - salzedo @xcite . in particular , by using a deformation argument starting from a nodal cubic , he obtains a family of hyperelliptic origamis that are totally ramified at the origin . for the case of degree @xmath11",
    ", this gives a unique cover of genus @xmath92 .",
    "more precisely , starting with an elliptic curve @xmath75 with full @xmath92-torsion in legendre form @xmath736 the hyperelliptic curve @xmath737 admits a morphism to @xmath75 given by @xmath738 that is only ramified at the points at infinity of these curves .",
    "it is important to note here that the field of moduli of these covers is an extension of the field of moduli of the base elliptic curve ; more precisely , as suggested by the formulas above , this field of moduli is exactly the field obtained by adjoint the @xmath92-torsion of the curve .",
    "this is a variation on a result in rubinstein - salzedo @xcite , where simpler expressions for similar covers are found in every degree .",
    "amusingly enough , adjoining the full @xmath92-torsion of the base curves always suffices to define these covers .",
    "this result is appealing and quite different from the corresponding situation for bely  maps , and therefore we ask the following question .",
    "covering maps of the projective line with more than 3 ramification points specialize to bely  maps by having the ramification points coincide . in many cases ,",
    "the covers in the original spaces are easier to compute , and this limiting process will then lead to some non - trivial bely  maps .",
    "this also works in reverse , and provides another application of computing bely  maps .",
    "riboulet - deyris @xcite explicitly computed polynomials with galois group @xmath739 and @xmath740 over @xmath741 with four branch points for small values of @xmath110 ; starting from a relatively simple `` degenerate '' three - point branched cover , the four - point branched cover is obtained by complex approximation ( using puiseux expansions ) .",
    "these methods were considerably augmented by hallouin in @xcite to find another such family with group @xmath742 .",
    "more recently , knig @xcite similarly computed such an extension of @xmath741 with galois group @xmath743 , using a @xmath0-adic approximation to calculate the initial three - point degeneration . in all aforementioned cases",
    ", the resulting covers can be specialized to find explicit solution to the inverse galois problem for the groups involved , and as mentioned at the end of section [ sec : backg ] , the results from @xcite have also found an application in the determination of equations for shimura curves @xcite .    as mentioned in section [ sec : coan ] , couveignes @xcite has used a patching method to describe more generally the computation of families of ramified branch covers , using a degeneration to the situation of three - point covers .",
    "more extensive algorithmic methods to deal with this question should therefore be in reach of the techniques of numerical algebraic geometry .",
    "there is an algorithm ( without a bound on the running time ) to accomplish this task , but it is one that no one would ever implement : there are only countably many bely  maps , so one can enumerate them one at a time in some order and use any one of the methods to check if the cover has the desired monodromy .",
    "it seems feasible that the grbner method would provide an answer to the above problem , but this remains an open question .",
    "javanpeykar @xcite has given explicit bounds on the faltings height of a curve in terms of the degree of a bely  map ; in principle , this could be used to compute the needed precision to recover the equations over a number field .",
