    "exponentially increasing demand for data rates as well as the spectrum congestion in the lower parts of the electromagnetic spectrum forces the wireless communications industry to explore systems adapted to frequencies within the so - called mmwave band @xcite .",
    "mobile operators are investigating the possibility of using mmwave frequencies for future generation of mobile communications , while migrating the backhaul networks to beyond 30  ghz @xcite .",
    "satellite industry has already established its presence in higher frequency bands by using the @xmath0  ghz band for feeder links as well as fixed - satellite - service ( fss ) user terminals in the downlink , and @xmath1  ghz band for the user terminal uplinks @xcite .",
    "such a migration to tens of ghz bands provides the wireless industry with a much higher bandwidths , and thus enables them to deploy multiple gbps services .    however , the development of communications systems in the mmwave bands is a challenging task .",
    "mmwave signals suffer from severe propagation loss , penetration loss and rain fading compared to signals in lower frequencies @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the short wavelength of mmwave frequencies enables the denser packing of more antennas in the transceiver ends which now may employ large array structures for providing high beamforming gains .",
    "furthermore , the large - scale transmit and receive arrays enable pre / post - coding techniques for multiple stream transmission resulting in significant spectral efficiency improvements .    even though conventional digital pre / post - coding techniques that were developed in the past years for lower frequency mimo systems are independent of the carrier frequency , they can not be applied in mmwave ones due to high demands in hardware complexity and power consumption .",
    "this is due to the one rf chain per antenna requirement for the implementation of a fully digital technique .",
    "each rf chain includes a number of different electronic elements among which are digital - to - analog / analog - to - digital converters that have high requirements in hardware and power consumption .",
    "thus , the implementation of a digital only mmwave transceiver is impractical and alternative approaches must be sought .    a first solution to the problem was given via analog only beamforming approaches @xcite .",
    "the core of these techniques is a network of analog phase shifters @xcite that imposes constant modulus constraints on the beamformer and requires only one rf chain , which is highly desirable from a hardware complexity / power consumption point of view . nevertheless , the major drawback of the analog only approaches is that they can not support multi - stream communication .",
    "therefore , in several cases they perform poorly compared to the fully digital approaches since they can not exploit the inherent spatial multiplexing gain of the channel .",
    "an alternative approach replaces the phase shifters with even simpler components , analog switches @xcite .",
    "however , this results in loss in array gain which again leads to performance degradation , especially for highly correlated channels , like the ones experienced in the mmwave band .",
    "a more efficient solution is based on a two stage hybrid beamformer that consists of a low dimensional digital pre - coder applied in the baseband ( bb ) and an analog beamformer applied in the rf domain @xcite .",
    "the analog processing part is usually implemented via a network of phase shifters .",
    "this architecture can be applied to systems with limited the number of rf chains and achieve performance close to the one of a fully digital approach under some conditions .",
    "the concept of hybrid pre - coding was firstly introduced as the so - called `` antenna soft selection '' for point - to - point mimo systems @xcite .",
    "an interesting result in @xcite showed that for single stream transmission , a hybrid beamformer can realize the corresponding fully digital one provided that both the transmitter and receiver ends are occupied with at least two rf chains .",
    "recent works @xcite generalize this result to multi - stream communications by showing that the required number of chains at both transceiver ends must be two times the number of transmitted streams in order for a hybrid architecture to achieve the optimal digital only solution .    in mmwave bands ,",
    "a similar approach to the one of antenna soft selection was introduced by the seminal papers @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the spectral efficiency maximization problem can be closely approximated by minimizing the frobenious norm of the difference of the fully digital solution to the product of the analog - digital counterparts of the hybrid pre - coder .",
    "the analog counterpart is selected from a pre - determined codebook and thus , the resulting problem is simplified by the recent advances in sparse reconstruction signal processing literature @xcite .",
    "the performance of this approach is satisfactory for large array systems that have in general strictly more rf chains than the transmitting streams and for low rank channels . in @xcite , the frobenious norm approximation problem of @xcite",
    "was solved without using a codebook for the analog counterpart solution .",
    "their solution was based on an alternating minimization procedure which it is shown to achieve significantly better performance than the one of @xcite when the number of the available rf chains at both transceiver ends is equal to the number of the transmitting streams . in @xcite , a codebook free approach",
    "is again proposed , though now the analog and digital parts of the beamformer are derived by solving two independent optimization problems after decoupling the original one .",
    "the decoupling of the analog - digital design is based on the assumption that the digital part is approximately orthonormal which in general holds for very large array systems .",
    "the performance of the latter approach is also superior compared to the one of @xcite for equal number of rf chains and transmitting streams .    in the literature of mmwave communications cited above",
    ", the wireless system is assumed as a stand - alone mimo communications system .",
    "considering the fact that mmwave bands are also highly allocated to several services ( e.g. point - to - point ( p2p ) or point - to - multipoint ( p2mp ) backhaul microwave links , satellite links , high resolution radar , radio astronomy , amateur radio e.t.c . )",
    "@xcite , such an assumption seems to be very optimistic .",
    "given also the current 5 g projections for traffic increase that imply an increase on backhaul demand @xcite , new generation backhaul networks will have to coexist with older generations since traditional solutions like network planning can not meet the demands .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to take the constraints on the imposed interference on the incumbent services into account while designing the mmwave transceivers .",
    "while several digital only cr transceiver designs have been proposed in literature so far @xcite , a mmwave system can not afford to accommodate the number of rf chains that these techniques require for the reasons discussed above in this section .",
    "this in turn can be alleviated by designing hybrid analog - digital transceivers subject to interference temperature constraints as in the case of traditional underlay cognitive radios .",
    "this is the subject of research in this paper .    in detail , the contributions of the present paper are as follows .",
    "two cognitive hybrid analog / digital transceiver designs for point - to - point mimo systems are presented with the view to maximize the spectral efficiency subject to interference to the primary user , power and hardware related ( limited number of rf chains ) constraints .",
    "both of the proposed approaches are based on the underlay cognitive radio paradigm @xcite where the secondary user ( su ) may access a spectrum area licensed to a primary user ( pu ) , simultaneously with the latter and provided that the interference power on the pu transmissions is below a predefined threshold .",
    "the proposed approaches derive the pre - coding and post - coding ( combining ) matrices by decoupling the transmitter receiver optimization problem .",
    "thus , at first the pre - coder is derived such that the system s mutual information is maximized subject to the constraints mentioned previously in this paragraph and then for that pre - coder , the optimal linear post - coding matrix is derived in a minimum mean square error ( mmse ) sense .",
    "the proposed transceiver designs are not based on a codebook and involve the solution of difficult non - convex optimization problems . the developed algorithms for their solution",
    "are based on the so - called alternating direction of multipliers method ( admm ) @xcite which is known for its good behaviour in several non - convex optimization problems @xcite , similar to the ones that are dealt in the present paper .",
    "the first approach derives the analog and digital pre - coding matrices by solving directly the mutual information maximization problem .",
    "as it was discussed before , existing solutions are based on approximations of the original problem or on a decoupled version with respect the analog and digital counterparts . as a consequence ,",
    "the solution derived in the present paper achieves satisfactory performance under any channel model and not only for low rank / highly correlated channels , similar to the ones that are based on the parametric mmwave models .",
    "thus , it may also be successfully applied in large array systems that function in lower frequencies and under typical fading channel models in order to reduce the hardware complexity / power consumption .",
    "moreover , it can be further applied to systems that have relative small number of antennas since it does not require orthonormal properties to be satisfied by the digital pre - coder part , as it is the case for the designs that are based on the decoupled analog - digital problem .",
    "while the first hybrid solution presents excellent performance under any conditions , its complexity is rather high due to the @xmath2 function that appears in the cost function of the mutual information maximization problem . to overcome this",
    ", we follow the approach of @xcite and approximate the solution to the mutual information maximization problem by the one that minimizes the frobenious norm of the difference of the hybrid beamformer to the optimal digital only one . a novel algorithm that requires significantly reduced complexity",
    "is derived to provide the solution to the last problem while it achieves close performance to the one of the first hybrid solution ( mutual information maximization problem ) for typical mmwave environments .",
    "furthermore , a novel solution for the cognitive receiver side post - coder is also developed .",
    "an efficient code - book free hybrid analog / digital post - coder is derived based on the mmse criterion and subject to the hardware constraints related to the phase shifters of the analog processing network .",
    "on the contrary , existing approaches are either codebook based @xcite or are considering the codebook free design of only the hybrid pre - coding matrix at the transmitter side @xcite .",
    "the convergence properties of the proposed algorithms are theoretically studied and their performance is evaluated via simulations for typical channel models .    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section ii , the system description is given . in section iii , the description of the optimal digital only solutions is given .",
    "section iv describes the hybrid transceiver design based on the mutual information maximization criterion . in section",
    "v , the alternative hybrid pre - coder design which is based on the frobenious norm approximation criterion , is presented .",
    "section vi presents some numerical results and section vii concludes the work .",
    "let us assume that a secondary user ( su ) @xmath3 mimo system access a spectrum area allocated to a @xmath4 primary user ( pu ) by employing a typical cognitive underlay approach ( fig .",

    "complex gaussian noise modeled as @xmath42 .    note that the su does not require explicit knowledge of matrix @xmath34 since it requires knowledge of only the overall matrix @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , the pu system may also apply a hybrid pre - coding technique in order to optimize its transmission or not ( i.e conventional mimo system ) , though as the proposed technique is independent of the latter , we chose an abstracted description to simplify the analysis .    in a similar manner ,",
    "the received signal at the pu receiver is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the @xmath4 channel matrix between the two pu ends , @xmath46 is the @xmath47 channel matrix between the su transmitter and the pu receiver and @xmath48 is i.i.d .",
    "complex gaussian noise modeled as @xmath49 .",
    "the mmwave channel presents limited spatial diversity due to the high free space pathloss and high antenna correlation due to the dense packing of large number of antennas .",
    "a geometrical channel model captures better these characteristics of the mmwave band .",
    "thus , by assuming that each of the involved systems employ an uniform linear array ( ula ) of antennas and @xmath50 propagation paths are between a transmitter @xmath51 and a receiver @xmath52 , the discrete narrow - band channel is given by @xcite@xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the complex gain of the @xmath55th path , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the azimuth angles of arrival and departure , respectively , that are uniformly distributed in @xmath58 .",

    "let us now assume that the su has perfect knowledge of @xmath23 , @xmath43 and @xmath46 channels .",
    "note that this is a typical requirement in cr underlay approaches @xcite .",
    "in general , since both the su and pu systems are operating in the same frequency and under the channel reciprocity assumption , it is straightforward to estimate the required information related to the cross su - pu channels via the training symbols of the pu system . since this a matter well - studied within the cr literature @xcite we avoid any further discussion .",
    "the aim is to derive the pre / post - coding matrices in order to maximize the spectral efficiency of the su system subject to constraints on the total transmission power ( @xmath67 ) and on the interference to the pu transmissions ( @xmath68 ) . to that end",
    ", the su system must solve the following optimization problem @xmath69 where the spectral efficiency @xmath70 is defined as @xmath71 with @xmath72 denoting the interference plus noise covariance matrix at the su receiver and @xmath73 is the determinant of a matrix .",
    "it is instructive to note that by imposing the interference power constraint on , the capacity loss of the pu due to the su transmissions is well regulated as it is proved in @xcite .",
    "thus , by setting @xmath68 to a sufficiently small value with respect to the noise power @xmath74 , the aforementioned capacity loss can be made arbitrary small .    for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we consider in this paper the case where interference constraints are posed from only one pu . extensions to the multiple pu case are straightforward by adding the corresponding interference related constraints on @xmath75 .    prior to presenting the proposed hybrid pre",
    "/ post - coding solutions , the equivalent digital only solution is discussed which will serve as a benchmark to the performance of the aforementioned hybrid approaches .",
    "in the digital only design , the su pre / post - coding matrices can be found by solving directly @xmath75 under the assumption that both the transmitter and the receiver ends have equal number of rf chains and antennas .",
    "this problem is in general intractable @xcite and the common approach is to temporally decouple the designs at the transmitter and the receiver . to that end",
    ", the optimal pre - coding matrix @xmath76 is designed such that the mutual information achieved by gaussian signaling over the wireless channel is maximized .",
    "therefore , the following optimization problem should be solved @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes a positive semi - definite matrix , @xmath79 is the covariance matrix of the interference plus noise signal and @xmath80 .",
    "in fact , @xmath81 is a whitening post - processing filter that maximizes the mutual information between the input and the output of the su system @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath82 is convex and thus , it can be solved efficiently by standard convex optimization techniques ( i.e. interior point methods @xcite ) .",
    "then , by applying the eigenvalue value decomposition on the optimal matrix @xmath83 , we may find @xmath84 .",
    "problem @xmath82 aims at maximizing the su s channel capacity assuming that the su receiver has full csi and can perform optimal nearest - neighbor decoding based on the @xmath85 dimensional received signal @xcite .",
    "this decoding approach requires high computational complexity even for typical mimo systems that have very few antennas compared to a mmwave one . a common approach that avoids the high complexity of the previous solution is to use a linear receiver design . to that end , in this paper a typical minimum mean square error ( mmse ) receiver is considered for the receive side of the su system .",
    "thus , matrix @xmath86 is derived as the solution to the optimization problem @xmath87 where @xmath88 denotes the frobenius norm .",
    "the solution to the previous problem is given by @xcite @xmath89 where we used - and the assumption that @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is a @xmath92 matrix of zero entries .",
    "in this section first , the hybrid analog - digital transmitter is developed by solving the mutual information maximization problem @xmath75 after casting it to the hybrid case .",
    "then , the hybrid mmse based solution for the post - coding matrix at the receiver is presented .      in the case of the hybrid approaches ,",
    "the solution to the su s spectral efficiency maximization problem @xmath75 is even harder to be derived since the constraints related to the phase shifters network force the analog pre-/post - coding matrices to lie in the non - convex space of constant modulus complex matrices . in order to achieve a simple solution",
    ", the transceiver design should be again temporally decoupled .",
    "let us first present the pre - coder design by considering the mutual information maximization problem @xmath82 which is now cast to the hybrid pre - coding case , that is @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 for an arbitrary matrix @xmath96 with complex entries @xmath97 .",

    "as it is evident from subsection iv.a , problem @xmath98 requires quite high complexity to be solved due to the involved @xmath2 function , since problem @xmath116 of the admm sequence via which the solution is derived , does not admit a closed form .",
    "thus , its solution is iteratively calculated by the projected gradient technique in every time step of the admm sequence , as described in subsection iv.a .",
    "therefore , in order to improve the complexity requirements , we need to seek for more efficient solutions to tackle this problem .    to that end",

    "the one based on the mutual information maximization problem ( `` algorithms 1 & 2 '' ) achieves better performance compared to the one that minimizes the distance of the hybrid pre - coder to digital only solution ( `` algorithms 3 & 2 '' ) .",
    "moreover note that as the snr increases , the gap in the performance of these two approaches increases too .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that at low snr values , the performance is mainly dominated by noise and thus the approximation of the original problem by the solution of algorithms 3 & 2 has lesser impact on the system s performance .",
    "mimo system and @xmath261 , scaledwidth=70.0% ]    on the contrary , for high snr values , the noise has negligible impact on the performance and thus the degradation due to the aforementioned approximation is more profound . a final point in figure 3",
    "is related to the performance of the technique in @xcite which is plotted for all the considered cases .",
    "as it is evident , the performance of that technique is severely inferior to the proposed ones , especially for high snr values .",
    "this is due to the codebook use that restricts the solution set of the analog counterpart , as it was also observed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "similar results are also observed in figure 4 where the experimental set - up is the same with figure 3 , though now a @xmath269 su system is assumed .",
    "all the techniques benefit from the larger number of antennas and achieve improved performance .",
    "the proposed hybrid techniques achieve again performance very close to the one of the digital only solution for systems with larger number of antenna elements .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the performance gap between the proposed techniques and the one in @xcite is smaller for larger array systems though still quite large , especially for high snr values .    in figure 5 , we examine the impact of the pu signal s rank on the performance of the proposed techniques .",
    "the number of rf chains is fixed to @xmath270 and @xmath267 .",
    "we consider pu signals of rank @xmath271 respectively .",
    "the rest of the parameters are the same with the ones of the experiments of figures 3 and 4 .",
    "as it was expected , the performance of all the techniques is degraded as the rank of pu signal s increases .     mimo system and @xmath272 , scaledwidth=70.0% ]    this can be attributed to the fact that more of the available degrees of freedom are occupied by the pu , as its signal s rank increases and thus , the su has to reduce further its transmitted power in order to satisfy the interference temperature constraint .",
    "both of the proposed hybrid approaches achieve once again close performance to the one of the digital only optimal solution , independently of the pu signal s rank . on the contrary",

    "aim at maximizing the spectral efficiency of the su while      keeping the interference to the pu bellow a pre - defined threshold .",

    "the post - coding matrix at the receiver side is derived by a novel hardware constrained mmse approach .",
    "the second technique aims at reducing the required computational complexity by deriving the optimal pre - coding matrix at the transmitter by minimizing the distance ( with respect to the frobenious norm ) of the hybrid solution to the optimal digital one . at the receiver side ,",
    "the post - coding matrix is based on the same solution to the one of the first technique .",

    "future works that are currently under development include the extension of the proposed approach to partially connected hybrid solutions and frequency selective channels .",
    "the proof is divided into two parts . at first",
    ", we show that given the convergence of the lagrange multiplier sequence , as it is defined in , the sequence @xmath164 has always a limit point . to that end , we begin by showing that the augmented lagrangian function given in is bounded from below .",
    "the equivalent scaled form @xcite of the latter function is given by @xmath276 the claim then is justified by considering the boundness of @xmath277 in .",
    "moreover , the optimization problems @xmath116 , @xmath148 and @xmath165 are convex with respect the optimizing variables and hence , @xmath118 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 are the corresponding unique minimizers .",
    "problem @xmath135 is non - convex , though set @xmath99 is closed and bounded and thus the sequence @xmath166 converges always to a limit point .",
    "let us further assume that variable @xmath113 is set to a large value such that the augmented lagrangian function is strongly convex with respect the optimizing variable in all the @xmath278 .",
    "due to the aforementioned strong convexity of the lagrange function the following equations hold @xcite @xmath279 where @xmath280 denotes the sub - gradient with respect @xmath96 .",
    "+ moreover , since @xmath281 , @xmath282 and @xmath283 are the minimizers of @xmath284 , @xmath285 and @xmath286 respectively , we have @xmath287 by combining - with - we may show that @xmath288 where @xmath289 . taking the summation of the last equality and considering that @xmath290 is bounded from below we have , @xmath291 since the second term is bounded by assumption",
    ", we can deduce that @xmath292 which implies the existence of the limit point of the admm sequence in the sense that @xmath293 we now move to the second part of the proof where the aim is to show that any limit point of the admm sequence - is a local optimal point of @xmath107 . by the kkt conditions ,",
    "an optimal point @xmath294 of @xmath107 should satisfy the set of equations given by @xmath295 now , from the optimality conditions of - we equivalently have @xmath296 since convergence of the admm sequence is guaranteed , we have that @xmath297 , as @xmath298 , where @xmath299 is the corresponding limit point . furthermore , as @xmath298 , @xmath300 and @xmath301 from and , respectively . the previous with their turn",
    "imply that @xmath302 by taking the limit of - and applying in order to simplify the results we get @xmath303 by comparing - to - , it is straightforward to see that the limit point @xmath304 satisfies the kkt conditions and thus it is optimal .",
