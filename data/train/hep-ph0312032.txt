    "due to the small size of the elemental electric charge @xmath1 , it is for most electromagnetic elementary particle reactions fully sufficient to calculate only in born approximation .",
    "but this is no longer true when heavy nuclei are involved , like e.g. lead , where the relevant perturbation expansion parameter @xmath2 is not small .",
    "it is then possible that even at high energies , the ratio of the exact and the born cross section does not approach unity .",
    "one prominent example for this observation is the photoelectric effect , where a single photon knocks out an electron from the @xmath3 shell , or electron positron pair production by a single photon incident on a nucleus , where the electron is captured into the @xmath3 shell @xcite . for small @xmath4 and high photon energy @xmath5 ,",
    "the cross section for these processes is given by the sauter formula @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the electron compton wavelength .",
    "applying the born approximation in the usual sense , i.e. by the use of plane waves for the positron , was attempted by hall and oppenheimer @xcite already in 1931 in the case of the photoelectric effect .",
    "but a central difficulty in the treatment of the photoeffect arose from the distorted wave function of the ejected electron .",
    "the bound state wave function depends on @xmath4 and only terms of relative order @xmath4 survive in the born matrix element .",
    "terms of this order also come from the continuum wave function . using exact wave functions for the continuum electron",
    ", it turns out that the cross section calculated from plane waves for the ejected electron is already wrong for small @xmath4 .",
    "it is therefore not astonishing that coulomb corrections can become very large even at high energies . for the derivation of the sauter formula ,",
    "nonrelativistic bound state wave functions and approximate sommerfeld - maue wave functions for the ejected electron were used .",
    "boyer @xcite improved the calculation by using exact bound state wave functions and sommerfeld - maue wave functions for the continuum wave function .",
    "the calculational advantage of using sommerfeld - maue wave functions relies in the fact that the exact continuum wave functions are only available as an expansion in partial waves , and for higher energies summation over a large number of terms is necessary in order to compute exact matrix elements .",
    "but sommerfeld - maue wave functions are valid for the coulomb potential of point - like charges , and hence do not take into account the finite size of the nucleus .",
    "we therefore pursue a similar strategy , namely the eikonal distorted wave approximation , where the advantage is that also finite size effects can be taken into account .",
    "this is clearly necessary for nuclear processes , whereas the relevant physical length scale of the photoelectric effect is given by @xmath8 and much larger than a typical nuclear radius .    in the following part of this paper",
    ", we revisit the eikonal approximation by giving a condensed introduction to the subject , where we also point out the most important facts related to possible improvements concerning the range of validity of the method in its basic form . in sect .",
    "3 , we apply our calculation to coherent vector meson electroproduction .",
    "it turns out that the coulomb corrections are indeed large for heavy nuclei , and that it is necessary to use a rather accurate description of the electrostatic nuclear potential .",
    "we correct some errors in the literature and rederive the eikonal result given in @xcite .",
    "for highly relativistic particles in a potential @xmath9 with asymptotic momentum @xmath10 , one may neglect the mass of the particle ( @xmath11 ) , such that the energy - momentum relation reduces to ( @xmath12 ) @xmath13 the classical relation ( [ classical ] ) for the ( initial ) momentum of the particle @xmath14 can be taken into account approximately in quantum theory by modifying the plane wave describing the initial state of the particle by the eikonal phase @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 if we choose the initial momentum parallel to the @xmath18-axis @xmath19 , the phase is @xmath20 the @xmath18-component of the momentum then becomes @xmath21 and further analysis shows that also the transverse momentum modification is well approximated .",
    "analogously , for the final state wave function follows @xmath22 where @xmath23 for the sake of simplicity , we consider spinless particles first .",
    "the spatial part of the free charged particle current @xmath24= e(\\vec{p}_i+\\vec{p}_f)e^{i(\\vec{p}_i- \\vec{p}_f)\\vec{r}}\\ ] ] becomes @xmath25=\\ ] ] @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the charge of the particle and @xmath28 .",
    "the spatial part of the current now contains the additional eikonal phase , and the prefactor contains gradient terms of the eikonal phase which represent essentially the change of the electron momentum due to the attraction of the electron by the nucleus .",
    "so far we have only considered the modification of the phase of the wave function , and for many problems , like the one treated in this paper , this is a sufficient approximation .",
    "it has been applied to elastic high energy scattering of dirac particles in an early paper by baker @xcite .",
    "however , the method leads , e.g. for quasielastic nucleon knockout scattering of electrons on lead with initial energy @xmath29 mev and energy transfer @xmath30 mev , to errors up to 50% in the calculated cross sections .",
    "the reason is that also the amplitude of the incoming and outgoing particle wave functions is changed due to the coulomb attraction .",
    "this fact is related to the classical observation that an ensemble of negatively charged test particles approaching a nucleus is focused due to its attractive potential . for the sake of completeness , we give here a short discussion of this effect .",
    "knoll @xcite derived the focusing from a high energy partial wave expansion , following previous results given by lenz and rosenfelder @xcite .",
    "e.g. , for the incoming particle wave in the vicinity of the nucleus he obtained an approximation for the electron wave function ( @xmath31 is the constant free electron spinor ) @xmath32 \\ } u_p , \\label{expknoll}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 describes spin changing effects .",
    "a similar formula holds for the final state wave function .",
    "the so - called effective momentum @xmath34 is parallel to @xmath10 and is given by the classical momentum of the electron in the center of the nucleus , i.e. @xmath35 . the parameters @xmath36 depend on the shape of the nuclear electrostatic potential . for a homogeneously charged sphere with radius @xmath37",
    "they are given by @xmath38 .",
    "the increase of the amplitude of the wave while passing through the nucleus is given by the @xmath39-term .",
    "the @xmath40-term accounts for the decrease of the focusing also in transverse direction .",
    "imaginary terms like @xmath41 describe the deformation of the wave front near the center of the nucleus .",
    "they could be obtained correspondingly by an expansion of the eikonal phase in that region , and @xmath42 is the eikonal phase in the center of the nucleus @xmath43 .",
    "apart from the spin structure which is absent for scalar particles , the eikonal approximation relies basically on the same strategy for particles with or without spin , namely on the modification of the wave function by the eikonal phase .",
    "but there are also gradient terms present in the expression for the spinless current ( [ scalarcurr ] ) , which lead to corrections to the current which are of comparable magnitude as those which result from the wave focusing",
    ". such terms are not explicitly present in the dirac expression for the current ( [ current1 ] ) below .",
    "it is instructive to have a closer look at the structure of the electron current in a potential .",
    "a gordon decomposition of the electron current @xmath44 can be performed by using the dirac equation @xmath45 \\psi=0 $ ] .",
    "the current can be split into a convective current and a spin current @xmath46 -\\frac{e^2}{m } \\bar{\\psi}\\psi a^\\mu \\biggr\\}\\ ] ] @xmath47 \\ , , \\label{current2}\\ ] ] which are separately conserved and gauge invariant . for exact solutions of the dirac equation ,",
    "the two forms of the current are of course equivalent . here , the convective current has exactly the same structure as the current of a scalar particle in a potential .",
    "@xcite calculate coulomb corrections by describing the leptons as spinless particles .",
    "the discussion above clarifies when such an approximation is justified ( see also sect .",
    "3 ) .    in the following",
    ", we will consider electrons with energies of the order of several gev .",
    "then the impact of the focusing effect on the matrix element will not be larger than about one percent even for heavy nuclei like lead , where the electrostatic potential in the center of the nucleus is ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) @xmath50 and @xmath51 fm is the equivalent radius of a homogeneously charged sphere , which we will call `` nuclear radius '' for short in the following .",
    "e.g. , for a scattering process where the initial and final momentum of the electron is of the order of @xmath52 gev / c , the focusing enters the cross section by a factor of the order @xmath53 , according to ( [ expknoll ] ) .",
    "coherent electroproduction of vector mesons from virtual photons plays an important role in the understanding of the transition of soft diffractive models to quantum chromodynamics @xcite .",
    "models based on the assumption of vector dominance have been applied successfully to describe the data @xcite .",
    "our intention is not to give a better model to describe the vector meson production , but to explore the importance of coulomb correction effects .",
    "therefore we use a schematic model , which captures some essential features of the production process .",
    "but it is clear that for a more realistic analysis a better model should be used .",

    "we looked therefore for potentials which allow an analytic calculation of the eikonal phase ( @xmath103 and @xmath104 as well ) .",
    "this is not a trivial problem , since the class of meaningful analytic potentials which allow to express the eikonal phase by known special functions is rather restricted .",

    "@xmath111 serves as an additional fit parameter .",

    "because the eikonal phase turns out to be divergent for a coulomb - like potential , we regularize the eikonal phase by subtracting a screening potential @xmath113 from ( [ pot_acc ] ) , such that the potential falls off like @xmath114 for large @xmath115 .",
