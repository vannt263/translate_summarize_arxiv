    "evidence for a first order melting phase transition from vortex crystal to vortex liquid has been found in recent magnetization measurements on clean crystals of ybco @xcite and bscco@xcite .",
    "the magnetization jump @xmath6 associated with the melting is found to be about @xmath7 t at @xmath8 t for ybco and @xmath9 t at @xmath10 t for bscco . by measuring the position of the phase boundary in the @xmath11-@xmath12 plane , and assuming a first order phase transition",

    ", @xmath13 is calculated to be much higher : about @xmath21/layer / vortex at @xmath22 t , and rapidly growing as the temperature approaches @xmath5@xcite .",

    "_ @xcite confirmed that the jumps in entropy / vortex / layer and magnetization satisfied the clausius - clapeyron equation , junod _",
    "_ @xcite found less satisfactory agreement , possibly due to sample inhomogeneities .",

    "however , the results from these simulations in the lll scheme should be treated with caution : they were performed using quasi - periodic boundary conditions , which imposes an effective ( spurious ) pinning potential on the vortex motion@xcite .",
    "a good example of the problem of using the quasi - periodic boundary condition is the case of two - dimensional ( 2d ) ( thin film ) simulations within the lll approximation : authors who use quasi - periodic boundary conditions see first order vortex melting @xcite , whereas simulations in which the 2d vortices move on the surface of a sphere @xcite , which involves no spurious pinning potential , see no phase transition at all !",
    "there is also no experimental evidence that thin film superconductors undergo a first order melting phase transition .",
    "a detailed discussion of this topic has been given in ref ..    on the theoretical front , it has been thought for a long time that the abrikosov lattice will melt into a vortex liquid , and that the phase transition will be first order@xcite .",
    "however , there is as yet no detailed melting theory . over the years",
    ", many theoretical investigations based on the melting scenario have relied upon the lindemann criterion : when the spatial fluctuations of a vortex due to thermal excitations become some fraction @xmath24 of the vortex lattice spacing , the lattice melts .",
    "the lindemann number @xmath24 is usually in the range 0.20.4@xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that the mechanism behind the apparent first order phase transition is the decoupling of the vortex - lines to pancakes@xcite .",
    "however , this does not explain the disappearance at the transition of the crystalline order seen in neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that the mean - field abrikosov solution is unstable against long wavelength thermal excitation of the shear modes of the vortex lattice in both the physical dimensions @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite . by calculating the off - diagonal long range order ( odlro ) in the low temperature regime",
    ", it has been shown that the lower critical dimension @xmath27 of the mixed phase is three for extreme type ii superconductors ( @xmath28 ) in an external magnetic field@xcite .",
    "( the lower critical dimension of an ordered phase is the spatial dimension at and below which a system can no longer sustain the long range order associated with that phase at non - zero temperature ) .",
    "it was suggested therefore that thermal fluctuations will modify the mean - field phase diagram as follows : for @xmath25 , the normal vortex liquid is the only thermodynamic phase . for @xmath1 , there are only the meissner and the normal vortex liquid phases .",
    "this theoretical scenario for @xmath1 is seemingly at odds with the overwhelming experimental and numerical evidence for a first order melting transition as outlined above , and hence has attracted little attention .",
    "recently , however , one of us @xcite has proposed that the apparent first order melting transition of a vortex crystal to a liquid may be a signature of a finite size effect rather than a genuine thermodynamic phase transition .",
    "this idea is based on an extension of refs . and .",
    "in this picture for @xmath1 , there exits only one true thermodynamic phase , the vortex liquid phase , characterized by two length scales @xmath2 and @xmath29 ; @xmath2 measures the phase correlation length along the magnetic field direction , and @xmath29 is the range of the ( short - range ) crystalline order .",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath29 are growing exponentially rapidly as the temperature is lowered , but they only become infinite at zero temperature . there is no phase transition to an ordered phase at any finite temperature .",
    "this scenario is that of zero temperature scaling@xcite . for a finite system ,",
    "the rapid growth of @xmath2 and @xmath29 as the temperature is lowered has profound consequences .",
    "for a bulk sample with a slab geometry and the field along the @xmath18-axis , the vortex liquid phase becomes phase correlated along the field direction upon cooling when @xmath2 reaches the sample thickness @xmath30 .",
    "then one has phase correlation right across the sample .",
    "the behavior of the system then crosses sharply over from that of a 3d vortex liquid to that of a 2d vortex liquid @xcite .",
    "such a crossover effect can explain the sudden drop in the @xmath18-axis resistivity @xcite .",
    "we will show later that this crossover can quantitatively explain the apparent jumps in the entropy and magnetization of the system observed in experiments . in this simple scenario",
    "there is no melting phase transition and a vortex crystal phase does not occur .",
    "the rapid growth of the @xmath18-axis phase correlation may have already been seen in flux transformer experiments on clean ybco crystals@xcite .",
    "right at the point where the apparent first order melting transition occurs , the voltage difference between various points on the top and bottom of the sample are as if the flux lines moved as rigid rods , indicating phase coherence across the sample thickness .",
    "( we acknowledge that a growing @xmath18-axis conductivity can also produce the same behavior without any substantial degree of phase coherence being present ) .",
    "recent numerical simulations in frustrated villain@xcite , xy @xcite and lll @xcite models have reported rapidly growing phase coherence along the @xmath18-axis upon cooling . with a conventional first order phase transition picture , it is difficult to explain the presence of such a growing length scale at the transition .",
    "in addition , the jumps in the magnetization and entropy in refs . and",
    "are actually rounded as functions of magnetic field and temperature .",
    "the width of the transition has been calculated within the crossover approach@xcite , and is in good agreement with data . if there were a genuine first order transition this rounding has to be explained on the basis of a sample artifact etc .    in this paper",
    ", we shall follow the zero temperature scaling idea and focus on the growing length scale and the role of finite size effects .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : we start by describing the lll approximation based on the the work of eilenberger @xcite and use it to study anharmonic fluctuations in the abrikosov phase .",
    "we then reproduce in section[sec_eqn_of_state ] the result that @xmath27 of the mixed phase is three @xcite within the framework of the loop expansion and estimate the growth rate of @xmath2 and @xmath29 as a function of temperature in three dimensions .",
    "we find the 3d-2d crossover line by setting @xmath31 , and compare it to the experimental melting line with the ginzburg number as the fitting parameter . both ybco and bscco",
    "are examined . in section [ sec_thermodynamics ] , we argue that the three dimensional form of the free energy crosses over sharply to the two dimensional thin - film form , mimicking the sharp changes in the thermodynamic potential associated with a first order phase transition .",
    "we will calculate the jumps in the first derivative of the free energy to find the entropy jump / layer / vortex , @xmath32 and the magnetization @xmath33 and compare them with experiment ( where the jumps are usually interpretated as being due to a first order phase transition ) .",

    "it is possible that the large value of @xmath135 needed to fit the data in bscco is really telling us that the mechanism of the two transitions in ybco and bscco are quite different e.g. that the crossover idea applies to ybco but that there is a genuine first order transition in bscco .    also of some interest",
    "is the angular dependence of the crossover line .",

    ", we will only examine the case of @xmath232 , i.e. a field along the @xmath18-axis .",
    "although the crossover behavior discussed above is a finite size induced effect rather than a phase transition , we can still associate with it a `` jump '' in the entropy per vortex per layer @xmath32 and the magnetization @xmath33 due to the narrowness of the crossover region .",
    "we believe that apparent first order melting signatures like the latent heat and magnetization jumps observed in experiments are in fact due to the entropy and magnetization differences between the 2d and 3d vortex liquid .",
    "although the jumps in the magnetization and entropy are reported to be sharp , they in fact have a finite width@xcite .",
    "such rounding of the jumps is usually attributed to the sample or magnetic field inhomogeneity .",
    "however , we can explain such rounding as the natural width of the crossover effect .",
    "a simple prescription to estimate the width is to find the small change @xmath233 in @xmath187 ( set by @xmath31 ) required for @xmath234 . using the definition of @xmath125",

    ", the crossover occurs at @xmath250 . for the 2d liquid",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath251 ( similar estimates apply to bscco ) . at such a low effective temperature ,",
    "the behavior of the 2d liquid is basically mean - field like , and fluctuation effects are negligible . with this in mind , the sharp changes in the thermodynamic functions between the two regimes can be obtained by subtracting the mean - field expression from that of the 3d expression .",
    "the second subtlety is that not all contributions to the entropy or magnetization are sensitive to the effect of crossover .",
    "for example , the short wavelength contributions are not modified when @xmath2 becomes comparable to @xmath30 , and so will not contribute to the jumps .",
    "therefore , in calculating the 3d entropy , magnetization and specific heat jumps , we need to examine all contributions and discard the pieces that are continuous over the crossover region .    before deriving the thermodynamic functions",
    ", we would like to specify how we envisage infinitesimal changes in the magnetic field , i.e. taking the derivatives of say , the free energy with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "we assume a finite system which is allowed to change its transverse area @xmath252 so that as the magnetic induction changes , the number of vortices inside the system , @xmath65 remain constant .",
    "the two are related by @xmath253 .",

    "therefore the apparent drop in entropy upon cooling through the crossover region is the total entropy minus all the background pieces ( including the mean - field contribution ) , that are continuous or smoothly varying in the crossover region .",
