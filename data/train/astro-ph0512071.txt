    "from the 1970s through the early 1990s , studies of galaxy clustering drove much of the progress in cosmology .",
    "measurements of steadily improving dynamic range and precision demonstrated good agreement with the predictions of a cosmological model incorporating scale - invariant , gaussian primeval fluctuations modulated by the transfer function expected in a universe dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) with @xmath9 ( where @xmath1 is the matter density parameter and @xmath10 ) .",
    "the advent of multi - fiber galaxy redshift surveys and improved photometric input catalogs has dramatically improved the precision of clustering measurements over the last decade , beginning with the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ; @xcite ) and continuing with the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; @xcite ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) . in parallel , numerical simulations and",
    "numerically tested analytic approximations have turned the task of calculating non - linear dark matter clustering from specified initial conditions into an essentially solved problem .",
    "the principal obstacle to drawing cosmological inferences from galaxy clustering measurements is now the uncertainty in the relation between the distribution of observable galaxies and the underlying distribution of dark matter , the problem known as galaxy bias .",
    "much of the cosmological progress in the last decade has been driven by observations that circumvent this complication , such as cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , weak gravitational lensing , the ly@xmath11 forest , and the type ia supernova diagram .",
    "these new observables favor an inflationary , low-@xmath1 , cdm - dominated model similar to that originally suggested by galaxy clustering , which in turn implies that the galaxies that dominate typical optically selected galaxy surveys must be approximately unbiased , in the sense that the rms galaxy count fluctuations are similar to the rms dark matter density fluctuations on large scales ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , observed galaxy clustering varies systematically with galaxy luminosity , color , and spectral or morphological type ( @xcite , and numerous references therein ) , and reproducing the observed galaxy correlation function in an inflationary cdm model requires that the bias of the correlation function vary with separation on scales below a few megaparsecs ( @xcite ) .",
    "the advances in observational cosmology over the last few years have also raised the stakes for galaxy clustering studies .",
    "we are no longer interested in , for example , distinguishing @xmath12 from @xmath13 ; instead , we want to constrain @xmath1 at the few percent level to increase the power of tests for the nature of dark energy . despite improvements in semi - analytic and numerical modeling of galaxy formation , it is not clear that these methods predict galaxy bias robustly enough for this kind of precision cosmology . faced with these challenges , most cosmological applications of the 2dfgrs and the sdss have focused on the linear or near - linear regime , where generic arguments suggest that the effects of galaxy bias should be relatively simple .",
    "these `` perturbative '' analyses of large - scale structure play a significant role in the current web of cosmological constraints ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but they are restricted to large scales where even these enormous surveys have limited statistical precision .    in this paper",
    "we argue that recent developments in the theoretical description of galaxy bias allow a more aggressive approach to inferring cosmological constraints from galaxy clustering measurements .",
    "we work in the framework of the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) , which characterizes galaxy bias in terms of the probability distribution @xmath14 that a dark matter halo of virial mass @xmath15 contains @xmath16 galaxies of a specified type , together with prescriptions for the spatial and velocity bias of galaxies within dark matter halos @xcite . here",
    "the term `` halo '' refers to a bound dark matter structure of typical overdensity @xmath17 , in approximate dynamical equilibrium , which may be the individual halo of a single bright galaxy or the common halo of a galaxy group or cluster .- body simulations by a friends - of - friends algorithm with linking length @xmath18 , but the precise definition of halo does not matter provided that one is consistent throughout all calculations . ]",
    "the flow diagram in figure  [ fig : flowchart ] , adapted from @xcite , sketches the interplay between the `` cosmological model '' and the `` physics of galaxy formation '' in determining observable galaxy clustering , which we take to include both the traditional statistics measured from redshift surveys and the galaxy - matter correlations measured by galaxy - galaxy lensing ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the left side ,",
    "the cosmological model , which specifies the initial conditions and the energy and matter contents of the universe , determines the mass function , spatial correlations , and velocity correlations of the dark halo population .",
    "the intervening box indicates that the only features of the cosmological model that really matter in this context are @xmath1 and the amplitude and shape of the linear matter power spectrum @xmath19 , here represented by @xmath2 ( the rms linear matter fluctuation in @xmath20 spheres ) , the inflationary spectral index @xmath21 , and the transfer function shape parameter @xmath3 , which itself depends on the values of @xmath1 , @xmath22 , and the baryon density @xcite .",
    "other features of the cosmological model , such as the energy density and equation of state of the vacuum component , may have an important impact on other cosmological observables or on the _ history _ of matter clustering , but they have virtually no effect on the halo population at @xmath23 , if the shape of @xmath19 and the present day value of @xmath2 are held fixed ( see @xcite ) .    on the right side of figure",
    "[ fig : flowchart ] , the box titled `` galaxy formation physics '' represents the additional processes  such as shock heating , radiative cooling , star formation , feedback , and mergers  that are essential to producing galaxies and determining their masses , luminosities , diameters , colors , and morphologies .",
    "these physical processes operate in the background provided by the evolving halo population , so together with the cosmological model they determine the hods of different classes of galaxies .",
    "the halo population and the hod together determine galaxy clustering and galaxy - mass correlations .",
    "one can , of course , use hydrodynamic simulations or semi - analytic models to predict galaxy clustering statistics directly , without computing the hod as an intermediate step ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , these predictions reflect the combination of the cosmological model and the galaxy formation theory , and unless one has complete confidence in the latter , one can not draw secure conclusions about the former .",
    "we would therefore like to know how well cosmological parameters can be constrained _ without _ relying on a detailed theory of galaxy formation , by using the data themselves to determine the relation between galaxies and dark matter .",
    "for this purpose , the hod formulation of bias has two key strengths , both emphasized by @xcite .",
    "the first is the division of labor implied by figure  [ fig : flowchart ] : galaxy formation physics influences the hod , but the properties of the halo population defined at @xmath17 are determined almost entirely by the much simpler physics of gravitational clustering , which can be modeled accurately using @xmath16-body simulations or numerically tested analytic approximations .",
    "the second is completeness : given a cosmological model and a specified hod , one can calculate any galaxy clustering statistic on any scale , by populating @xmath16-body halos or by drawing on a steadily expanding array of analytic techniques .",
    "the hods of different galaxy classes therefore encode , statistically , all the aspects of galaxy formation physics that are relevant to predictions of galaxy clustering .",
    "( we discuss an important caveat to this statement below . )",
    "hod modeling enables one to take full advantage of galaxy clustering data , with no restriction to large scales or particular statistics .",
    "the goal of our empirical approach is to reverse the causal arrows in figure  [ fig : flowchart ] , working backwards from the data to properties of the hod and the halo population , and from there to conclusions about galaxy formation physics and fundamental aspects of cosmology .",
    "@xcite considered a fixed cosmological model and showed how changes to the hod affect many of the traditional statistical measures of galaxy clustering , such as correlation functions , the group multiplicity function , and redshift - space distortions .",
    "they argued that the complementary information from different statistics and different spatial scales should permit an accurate empirical reconstruction of the hod for a specified cosmology , yielding physically informative tests of galaxy formation theories .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and the power spectrum shape have non - degenerate effects on the _ halo _ population , and they argued that changes to the galaxy hod could not fully mask the effects of cosmological parameter changes . here",
    "we complete this theoretical program by showing how galaxy clustering measurements can constrain simultaneous changes to the cosmological model and the galaxy hod .",
    "our results add quantitative teeth to the qualitative arguments and speculations in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we define our cosmological parameter space by the values of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "we concentrate mainly on @xmath1 and @xmath2 because @xmath3 ( or , more generally , the shape of the linear power spectrum ) can be well constrained by combining the large - scale galaxy power spectrum with other observables like cmb anisotropy and the ly@xmath11 forest .",
    "we first compute predicted values of a number of galaxy clustering observables , assuming a central model with observationally motivated choices of cosmological parameters and the galaxy hod .",
    "we then change one or more cosmological parameters , and we test how well this new cosmological model can reproduce the original clustering `` data '' given complete freedom to vary the hod within a very flexible parameterization . to gain insight , we first explore several interesting axes within the @xmath24 parameter space , varying parameters individually or in physically motivated combinations .",
    "we arrive at definite numbers by assuming that each of our 30 observables , some of which represent the same clustering statistic measured at multiple scales , can be measured with 10% uncorrelated fractional uncertainty from a survey like the sdss .",
    "this assumption seems roughly plausible , but the ultimate strength of cosmological conclusions will depend on the precision and dynamic range of the measurements . forecasting this precision for a survey like the sdss , including",
    "the covariance of errors among different observables , is itself a major theoretical task , which we will not undertake here . for our theoretical investigation ,",
    "we further restrict ourselves to observables for which we have reasonable analytic approximations , and we suspect that our quantitative conclusions will in the end prove overly pessimistic because we must omit some observables that contain significant additional information .    as discussed by @xcite , the completeness of the hod as a description of bias rests on the assumption that the galaxy content of a halo of virial mass @xmath15 is statistically independent of the halo s larger scale environment .",
    "@xcite show that this assumption accurately describes the galaxy population in weinberg et al.s ( @xcite ) hydrodynamic cosmological simulation .",
    "it has fundamental theoretical roots in the excursion set model of @xcite , which predicts that the statistical features of a halo s assembly history depend only on its present mass ; indeed , all semi - analytic galaxy formation models that use statistically generated merger trees make this assumption implicitly .",
    "since the halo mass function itself varies with environment , with high - mass halos absent in low - density regions , models that tie galaxy populations to halo masses still predict strong correlations between galaxy properties and the large - scale environment , in good agreement with observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , while @xcite show that @xmath16-body halos of mass @xmath25 have similar properties and formation histories in different environments , recent studies show a substantial correlation of halo formation redshift with large - scale overdensity for lower mass halos ( @xmath26 ) , contradicting the simplest form of the @xcite model ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . as discussed below in  [ sec : environment ] , we expect the impact of such dependence on the clustering statistics of mass- or luminosity - thresholded galaxy samples to be small , but given the level of precision we eventually hope to reach , it will probably be necessary to allow for it when fitting the data .",
    "strategies for incorporating environmental variations into hod modeling will require guidance from the next generation of hydrodynamic and semi - analytic models of galaxy clustering , and we reserve this task for future investigation .",
    "ultimately , the assumption of an environment - independent hod , or of any particular parameterization of environmental dependence , must be tested empirically by checking that the adopted model can consistently explain the variations of galaxy clustering with large - scale environment .",
    "many current efforts to constrain cosmological parameters with galaxy clustering data make ( explicitly or implicitly ) the much stronger assumption that galaxy bias can be adequately described by a linear model , @xmath27 , on the relevant scales . here",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 are the galaxy and dark matter density contrast , respectively , and the linear bias factor @xmath30 may depend on galaxy type but is assumed to be independent of scale . in this case , @xmath31 , and the shape of the galaxy power spectrum provides powerful cosmological constraints in combination with cmb data even if @xmath30 is unknown @xcite .",
    "large - scale redshift - space distortions measure @xmath32 @xcite , which in combination with clustering measurements constrains @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the measured rms fluctuation of the _ galaxy _ density contrast at @xmath20 . the mass function or x - ray temperature function of galaxy clusters constrains a similar combination of @xmath2 and @xmath1 @xcite by a route that is independent of galaxy bias . at low redshift ,",
    "the combination of galaxy - galaxy lensing with the galaxy - galaxy correlation function constrains a somewhat different combination of these parameters , @xmath35 , assuming a linear bias model with @xmath36 .",
    "the triangle shape dependence of the reduced galaxy bispectrum can constrain @xmath30 directly @xcite , in this case assuming a quadratic bias model @xmath37 to relate the galaxy and mass density fields at second order @xcite .",
    "general theoretical arguments suggest that linear bias should be a good approximation for the power spectrum on sufficiently large scales , provided that the efficiency of galaxy formation is determined by the local ( @xmath38 few mpc ) environment @xcite .",
    "numerical experiments using such `` local '' bias models also show that the `` @xmath30 '' multiplying the power spectrum amplitude should be similar to the `` @xmath30 '' affecting redshift - space distortions @xcite .",
    "thus , the combination of these perturbative galaxy clustering analyses can in principle yield separate constraints on @xmath3 ( measured directly from the power spectrum shape ) , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , with the degeneracy of @xmath1 and @xmath2 broken either by the bispectrum analysis or by the different @xmath1 dependence of the galaxy - galaxy lensing constraint and the @xmath39 or cluster normalization constraints .",
    "the applications of these techniques to 2dfgrs and sdss data show an impressive degree of internal consistency and good agreement with external cosmological constraints ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , reliance on the linear or quadratic bias approximations restricts these analyses to large scales , and it is not clear that these approximations hold consistently at the level of accuracy desired for further improvements ( better than 10% , say ) , since scatter in the relation between galaxy and mass densities can have different effects on different statistics and at different scales @xcite .",
    "the hod approach to galaxy clustering analysis substitutes a much more general model of galaxy bias , and it makes use of high - precision measurements from small and intermediate scales ( from sub - mpc to @xmath8 ) in addition to the lower precision measurements in the perturbative regime . furthermore , regardless of the strength of the cosmological constraints , the hod parameters derived from the data themselves provide detailed tests of galaxy formation models .",
    "the program of hod - based interpretation of observed galaxy clustering is , in fact , well underway . @xcite and @xcite used hod - type bias models to interpret the correlation functions and pairwise velocity dispersions measured from the lcrs and the point - source catalog redshift survey ( pscz ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite used the group multiplicity function to constrain the galaxy occupations of high - mass halos .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite applied hod modeling to galaxy - galaxy lensing measurements from the sdss .",
    "@xcite , analyzing a volume - limited sample of bright ( @xmath40 ) sdss galaxies , showed that hod models naturally explain the observed deviation from a power - law correlation function .",
    "@xcite measured the luminosity and color dependence of the sdss galaxy correlation function and used it to infer the luminosity and color dependence of the galaxy hod , finding results in good qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "@xcite used a similar approach to investigate the halo occupations of early- and late - type galaxies in the 2dfgrs , while @xcite derived hods of red and blue 2dfgrs galaxies from the group catalog of @xcite , testing the consistency of their result by comparing predicted and observed correlation functions .",
    "@xcite used the sdss measurements for @xmath40 galaxies in conjunction with cmb anisotropy data to infer simultaneous constraints on hod and cosmological parameters .",
    "@xcite used hod modeling of zehavi et al.s ( @xcite ) clustering measurements to predict cluster mass - to - light ( @xmath41 ) ratios , and they inferred constraints on @xmath42 by comparing to published @xmath41 measurements .",
    "hod models have been applied to the interpretation of high - redshift clustering by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite have initiated a comprehensive program similar to the one described here , based on the closely related conditional luminosity function ( clf ) formalism ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "throughout this paper we adopt spatially flat @xmath43cdm cosmological models with gaussian initial density fluctuations .",
    "the cosmological model is defined by the mass density parameter @xmath1 and the mass fluctuation power spectrum @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the wavenumber , @xmath21 is the spectral index of the inflationary power spectrum , and @xmath46 is the transfer function with shape parameter @xmath3 .",
    "we parameterize each cosmological model in this paper by @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath21 , and @xmath3 , where @xmath2 is the rms fluctuation of the linear density field filtered with a top - hat filter of radius @xmath47 .",
    "we adopt the parameterization of @xcite for the transfer function @xmath46 , which approximates the evolution of adiabatic primordial fluctuations .",
    "this formulation suffices for our purpose of investigating how galaxy clustering data constrain hod and cosmological parameters , with a single parameter @xmath3 encoding the combined effects of the matter - radiation transition ( at the scale @xmath48 ) and the suppression of fluctuation growth in baryon or massive neutrino components .",
    "observational analyses should use a more accurate transfer function , e.g. , from cmbfast @xcite , but this would not change the sensitivity to the shape and amplitude of @xmath19 . it is important to note that we treat @xmath1 and @xmath3 as independently variable quantities ; we do not automatically change the power spectrum shape when we change @xmath1 . in the context of @xmath43cdm , our approach implicitly assumes that a change in @xmath1 is compensated by a change in @xmath22 or some other parameter to keep the power spectrum at its empirically constrained shape .",
    "our calculations of galaxy clustering statistics rely on analytic descriptions of the density profiles , mass function , spatial clustering , and velocity statistics of dark matter halos .",

    "recent numerical work @xcite suggests that the bias factors given by equation  ( [ eqn : halobias ] ) are systematically too high .",
    "since we use the same approximations to calculate the `` observations '' of our central model and the `` predictions '' of others , we do not expect moderate errors in @xmath77 to alter our conclusions .",
    "however , comparisons to real observational data should use the most accurate available bias factors .",

    "we assume that the 1d velocity dispersion of dark matter _ within _ a halo of mass @xmath15 has the value @xmath94 expected for a singular isothermal sphere , independent of radius .",
    "moderate departures from this assumption can be accommodated by the velocity bias parameter @xmath95 , described below .",
    "the hod of a specified class of galaxies is defined by the probability distribution @xmath14 that a halo of mass @xmath15 hosts @xmath16 galaxies , together with prescriptions for the spatial and velocity distributions of galaxies within halos relative to those of the dark matter particles . for our purpose in this paper , we want a flexible parameterization of the hod that could describe the relevant features of any physically reasonable model .",
    "we want the constraints on the hod to be imposed by the clustering measurements rather than by our parameterization , and we want to give each cosmological model its best shot at reproducing these measurements before rejecting it .",
    "conceptually , it is useful to separate @xmath96 into a mean occupation function @xmath97 , defined by @xmath98 , and a distribution @xmath99 at fixed halo mass .",

    "the predicted hod depends on the defining characteristics of the galaxy sample , such as luminosity , color , and morphological type .",
    "for the most sensitive cosmological investigations , it seems best to work with volume - limited samples defined by luminosity thresholds , which are the largest homogeneous samples ( i.e. , with the same distribution of galaxy types at all distances ) that one can construct from an apparent magnitude - limited survey . in this case",
    ", @xmath97 should be a more or less monotonic function of halo mass , since more massive halos contain , on average , either more galaxies or brighter galaxies .",
    "below some cutoff mass , @xmath97 should drop to zero , as low - mass halos do not contain enough cooled baryons to make a galaxy above the luminosity threshold . instead of a luminosity threshold",
    ", one can impose a threshold in stellar mass , estimated for each galaxy from its luminosity and its color or spectral energy distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this approach should reduce the scatter between the galaxy observable and the host halo mass by reducing the impact of stellar population variations , thus sharpening the cutoff in @xmath97 and minimizing its environmental dependence .",
    "however , if one starts from an apparent magnitude - limited survey , then the mass - thresholded samples one can create are smaller than the luminosity - thresholded samples because of the range of galaxy colors .",
    "while we do not want to impose strong theoretical priors on our hod parameterization , we have decided to incorporate one of the most generic and useful results that comes from the galaxy formation papers cited above : the distinction between central and satellite galaxies . in hydrodynamic simulations and semi - analytic models ,",
    "most halos contain a galaxy near the center of mass , moving close to the center - of - mass velocity , which is usually more massive and older than any other galaxies in the halo @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that the central - satellite distinction naturally explains one of the quantitatively important properties of the hod , the sub - poisson width of @xmath99 at small mean occupation numbers . for satellite dark matter subhalos , the fluctuations about",
    "the mean occupation are close to poisson , but the number of central galaxies is by definition either zero or one , thus obeying nearest - integer ( bernoulli ) statistics .",
    "fluctuations in the full @xmath99 are substantially sub - poisson as long as the central galaxy makes a significant contribution to @xmath97 .",
    "@xcite show that this argument carries over to galaxies in hydrodynamic simulations and semi - analytic models .",
    "motivated by these results , we model the mean occupation function for galaxies above a luminosity threshold as @xmath100[1+s(m)],\\ ] ] where the last set of square brackets represents the sum of one central galaxy and @xmath101 satellites and the first provides a smooth cutoff near @xmath102 .",
    "the form of the cutoff profile corresponds to a log - normal distribution of central galaxy luminosity at fixed halo mass ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we apply the same cutoff profile to satellite galaxy numbers , although in practice these are already well below unity close to @xmath102 . to model @xmath101 in a flexible way , we take the free parameters to be the values of @xmath103 at @xmath104 fixed values of @xmath105 and define the continuous function by a cubic spline that passes through these @xmath104 values . we set @xmath106 and choose values of @xmath103 at @xmath107 , 12 , 13 , 14 , and 15 for the spline fit .",
    "halos more massive than @xmath108 are too rare to have much impact on the clustering statistics we consider here .",
    "theoretical predictions of @xmath101 can be accurately described by a truncated power - law parameterized by a slope , amplitude , and low - mass cutoff ( @xcite ) , but our five - parameter model allows for curvature or inflections that depart from these theoretical predictions .",
    "in addition to the @xmath101 values , the adjustable parameters of equation  ( [ eqn : navg ] ) are @xmath109 and @xmath102 .",
    "we always assume that the uncertainty in the galaxy mean density is negligible in comparison to the uncertainty in the clustering measurements .",
    "therefore , once we have specified @xmath101 and @xmath109 , we choose the value of @xmath102 that yields the correct mean number density , rather than treating it as a free parameter .",
    "( we could pick any of the parameters for this treatment , but the mean density is most sensitive to @xmath102 . )    for the clustering measures and analytic approximations used in this paper , the only property of @xmath99 that we need to specify is the second factorial moment @xmath110 , which determines the mean number of pairs per halo .",
    "the number of central galaxies is zero or one with a relative probability determined by the mean @xmath111 . for satellite galaxies ,",
    "we introduce a width parameter @xmath112 defined by @xmath113 the value @xmath114 corresponds to a poisson distribution of satellite numbers @xmath115 at fixed halo mass , consistent with theoretical predictions .",
    "the parameter @xmath112 allows the satellite probability to be broader or narrower than poisson .",
    "the full probability distribution becomes narrow at low @xmath97 in any case because of central galaxies .",

    "satellite galaxies have a radial profile similar to that of the dark matter . however , the physical processes that determine the satellite profile are complex ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , so there is no reason to expect the profiles to be identical . here",
    "we assume that satellite galaxies in a halo still follow an nfw profile , but we allow the galaxy concentration parameter @xmath118 to differ from the underlying dark matter concentration parameter @xmath57 .",
    "we characterize the relative spatial distributions of satellite galaxies and dark matter by @xmath119 , where a positive ( negative ) @xmath120 means that galaxies are more ( less ) centrally concentrated than dark matter .",
    "we assume that central galaxies always reside at the halo center of mass .",
    "we also allow the velocity dispersion of satellites to differ from the velocity dispersion of dark matter by an average factor @xmath95 , which we assume to be independent of mass .",
    "central galaxies are assumed to move at the halo center - of - mass velocity .",

    "the obtainable constraints on cosmological parameters depend , of course , on the precision of the clustering measurements .",

    "the solid contours are obtained by assuming 5% errors for the set of observables indicated in the upper right corner of the panel , keeping 10% for other sets .    with the galaxy bias factor constrained by other observables ,",
    "a better measurement of galaxy density contrasts @xmath297 leads to a better constraint on @xmath2 , shrinking contours at both ends .",
    "the tighter @xmath2 constraint in turn produces a slightly tighter @xmath1 constraint , but there is essentially no improvement in the @xmath334 constraint ( i.e. , the width of the contours in the narrow direction is unchanged ) . reducing the observational error bar on @xmath197 produces a similar improvement for a different reason",
    " the more precise measurements of @xmath197 allow a better constraint on the galaxy bias factor @xmath147 , so they help to break the degeneracy between @xmath147 and the amplitude of the dark matter power spectrum .",
    "improving the pairwise velocity dispersion measurements produces modest improvements in both the @xmath334 constraint and the individual constraints on @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the former improvement comes mainly from the large - scale velocity dispersion , which depends on halo velocities and thus scales roughly with @xmath42 .",
    "the individual parameter improvements come mainly from the interplay of small - scale @xmath306 with the apparent virial mass @xmath178 .",
    "better @xmath306 measurements yield tighter constraints on the velocity bias parameter , and the small - scale @xmath306 and @xmath178 measurements then constrain the halo mass scale . improving the @xmath178 measurements on their own yields better @xmath2 and @xmath1 constraints but does not change the @xmath334 constraint .    improving the @xmath126 measurements",
    "leads to a significantly better determination of @xmath2 for two reasons : it tightens the constraints on @xmath14 and thus on the large - scale galaxy bias factor , and it improves the measurement of the large - scale galaxy clustering amplitude itself .",
    "these two effects are analogous to those discussed earlier for @xmath197 and @xmath297 , respectively . although @xmath126 is not directly sensitive to @xmath1 , the tighter @xmath2 constraint produces a tighter @xmath1 constraint when combined with dynamical measurements . improving @xmath224 measurements produces surprisingly little improvement in the cosmological parameter constraints .",
    "if we instead degrade the fractional errors on @xmath224 to 50% , the constraints ( shown by light solid contours ) get noticeably but not dramatically worse .",
    "while it is always possible to reproduce @xmath224 exactly by choosing the appropriate @xmath97 , this choice pins down the mass associated with a given multiplicity , and it largely pins down the galaxy bias factor .",
    "it appears , however , that the @xmath126 measurements already determine the high end of @xmath97 well enough for these purposes , so that moderate improvements in @xmath224 do not add much power . if we degrade the presumed measurement errors on @xmath126 to 25% , then the impact of improving the @xmath224 measurements is larger , but it is still not dramatic .",
    "the apparent redundancy of the @xmath224 and @xmath126 constraints makes them a valuable consistency check on the underlying assumptions of the hod modeling .",
    "for example , the bias factor of single - galaxy halos affects @xmath126 but not @xmath224 , so an hod model that makes the wrong assumption about this bias factor will lead to conflicting estimates of @xmath97 at high masses .",
    "we have also examined the consequences of adopting priors on the hod parameters , which could be motivated by theoretical or observational considerations .",
    "for example , numerical simulations give some idea of the plausible range of values for the velocity bias factor , and tully - fisher measurements can put limits on hod parameters describing the cutoff profile of the mean occupation function .",
    "we characterize the priors by a 1-@xmath254 deviation allowed from a central value and minimize the sum of the @xmath0 function and a quadratic term for the prior ( see appendix  [ sec : appendixb ] ) . with a 1-@xmath254 range of @xmath351 for the velocity bias factor @xmath95 or @xmath352 for the distribution width parameter @xmath112",
    ", we find that there is almost no improvement in cosmological constraints .",
    "the reason is that , even without these priors , the measurements have already excluded cosmological models that need extreme values of @xmath95 and @xmath112 . for example , models that need @xmath95 as high as 1.3 have @xmath353 and @xmath354 ( see figures  [ fig : hodpar_omega ] and [ fig : hodpar_sig8 ] ) .",
    "adopting a prior for the halo concentration parameter @xmath260 with 1-@xmath254 range of @xmath355 only slightly improves the cosmological constraints by excluding some small regions of extremely high or low values of @xmath2 .",
    "priors on these hod parameters must therefore be quite strong before they would improve the constraints obtainable from the observable set considered here .",
    "as we have shown in figure  [ fig : mcmc_hodpar ] , for a fixed cosmology , the cutoff profile of the hod can not be well - constrained with the observables we adopt in this paper .",
    "this result suggests that priors in the _ shape _ of the cutoff profile would not improve constraints on cosmological parameters . to verify this expectation",
    ", we perform a test in which we fix the cutoff profile width @xmath109 to the central model value .",
    "the resulting cosmological constraints are virtually identical to those in figure  [ fig : contour ] , where @xmath109 is not fixed .",
    "however , if the value of the absolute cutoff mass scale can also be pinned down , e.g. from the tully - fisher relation or other dynamical measurements in the single - galaxy regime , then cosmological constraints improve substantially .",

    "the strong constraint on the halo mass scale from the value of @xmath102 produces a tight constraint on @xmath1 ( @xmath356 ) , which in turn leads to a much tighter constraint on @xmath2 ( @xmath357 ) .    finally , we consider the constraints achievable with a brighter , lower density galaxy sample",
    ". different samples of galaxies have different hods , but they should probe the same underlying cosmology .",
    "all the investigations we have presented so far are based on the luminosity - threshold sample with a number density @xmath214 , roughly corresponding to the @xmath358 galaxies in the sdss .",
    "we increase the mass scale of our central model hod to construct a galaxy sample with number density 10 times smaller ( @xmath359 ) , which approximates the sdss @xmath360 sample ( @xcite ) . with the same assumption of 10% fractional error on each of the 30 observables",
    ", we find that the cosmological constraints from these two galaxy samples are quite similar , with the degeneracy direction @xmath309 slightly rotated to higher @xmath336 for the lower density sample .",
    "thus , measurements for these two largely independent galaxy samples should allow an important consistency check on cosmological conclusions and , if the results are combined , a @xmath361 reduction in statistical errors .",
    "perhaps the most important implication of figure  [ fig : chgerr ] is that the cosmological constraints do not rely on one or two clustering statistics but instead emerge from the interlocking web of measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig : matrix ] demonstrates this point in a different way .",
    "it shows the `` influence matrix , '' which we define in terms of the partial derivatives @xmath362 evaluated at the central hod and cosmological model .",
    "each predicted observable @xmath363 is a function of cosmological and hod parameters , and each @xmath364 represents one of these parameters , so the influence matrix encodes the response of the observables to the individual model parameters . when evaluating the partial derivatives , we adjust @xmath102 so that the galaxy number density stays fixed , but we keep the remaining hod and cosmological parameters ( other than @xmath364 ) fixed .",
    "the influence matrix is closely related to the fisher matrix , @xmath365 where @xmath366 is the vector of the predicted observables and @xmath367 is the covariance matrix of the errors . however , while the fisher matrix depends strongly on the assumed error covariance matrix @xmath367 , the influence matrix is independent of this assumption , and it reveals the dependence of observables on model parameters in a more transparent manner .    figure  [ fig : matrix ] shows the influence matrix calculated at the central model .",
    "the area of each circle is proportional to the element of the matrix from the corresponding observable ( _ vertical axis _ ) and parameter ( _ horizontal axis _ ) .",
    "the hod parameter @xmath102 , determined by matching the galaxy number density , is presented here as an observable , since its value could in principle be probed by dynamical or weak - lensing measurements in the single - galaxy regime .",
    "if two columns have similar elements , then the corresponding parameters are largely degenerate , since an increase in one can be compensated by a decrease in the other .",
    "the first three columns of figure  [ fig : matrix ] show how clustering observables vary with cosmological parameters .",
    "most elements of @xmath368 and @xmath369 are positive .",
    "an increase in @xmath1 shifts the halo mass function to higher mass scales ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mf_xim ] ) , and with the fixed satellite hod , this shift increases the group multiplicity function @xmath299 . to keep a fixed galaxy number density , @xmath102 increases by a larger factor than @xmath1 , and the shift of galaxies to halos with larger",
    "@xmath370 leads to stronger galaxy bias for spatial clustering statistics @xmath297 and @xmath298 .",
    "an increase in @xmath2 boosts the matter clustering directly . raising either parameter increases halo masses and velocities , and thus the values of dynamical observables .",
    "the similar form of these vectors implies significant degeneracy between these two parameters , with an overall trend that roughly follows @xmath371 , but the degeneracy is not complete .",
    "the power spectrum shape parameter @xmath3 is largely decoupled from @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the much stronger sensitivity of @xmath102 to @xmath1 than to any other cosmological or hod parameter explains why a tight observational constraint on @xmath102 can produce such a tight constraint on @xmath1 (  [ sec : general ] ) .",
    "the sensitivity of spatial clustering statistics to @xmath1 , which contrasts with the flat @xmath245 shown by the dotted line in figure  [ fig : chi2_omega ] , arises because we here keep all mass scales in the hod fixed except for @xmath102 .",
    "if we instead scale all masses @xmath372 , then the derivatives of @xmath298 , @xmath299 , and @xmath2 with respect to @xmath1 essentially vanish , as expected , while the derivatives of @xmath178 become one instead of zero .",
    "the rightmost nine columns in figure  [ fig : matrix ] show how clustering observables vary with the hod parameters , with cosmological parameters held fixed .",
    "a degeneracy between a cosmological parameter and hod parameters exists to the extent that the `` influence vector '' @xmath373 can be approximated by a linear combination of the influence vectors @xmath374 , where @xmath375 is the cosmological parameter and @xmath376 are the hod parameters . as expected from our earlier results , a substantial degeneracy exists if we restrict @xmath366 to the spatial clustering observables @xmath298 , @xmath299 , and @xmath297 .",
    "for example , an increase in @xmath2 can be largely compensated by decreases in the parameters @xmath377 and @xmath265 that describe the high end of @xmath97 , and changes in @xmath112 and @xmath120 can take up some amount of residual difference .",
    "however , with the full set of observables , the structures of @xmath368 , @xmath369 , and @xmath378 are quite different from any of the influence vectors of individual hod parameters .",
    "the visual structure of figure  [ fig : matrix ] suggests that there is no linear combination of the hod influence vectors that accurately approximates the cosmological parameter influence vectors .",
    "we verify this suggestion by solving for the combination coefficients that minimize the squared difference between the @xmath1 influence vector and the corresponding linear combination of the hod influence vectors .",
    "( we do not include @xmath102 as an observable here , since it probably can not be measured as precisely as the other quantities . )",
    "figure  [ fig : lincomb]@xmath252 shows the hod influence vectors multiplied by these linear combination coefficients .",
    "the @xmath377 and @xmath265 parameters dominate the best - fit linear combination , with @xmath95 compensating for the increase in @xmath178 that would otherwise occur .",
    "figure  [ fig : lincomb]@xmath57 shows that this best - fit linear combination ( _ open squares _ ) does not fully recover the @xmath1 influence vector ( _ filled circles _ ) , with pairwise dispersions and ( especially ) galaxy - mass correlations providing the largest discrepancy . if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are allowed to vary in addition to the hod parameters , then the best - fit linear combination ( _ open circles _ in fig .",
    "[ fig : lincomb]@xmath57 ) is a better approximation to the @xmath1 influence vector , with clear improvement in @xmath306 and @xmath379 . figure  [ fig : lincomb]@xmath30 shows that the contribution from the @xmath2 influence vector is much larger than that from any of the hod influence vectors .",
    "nonetheless , the changes in @xmath377 and @xmath265 significantly improve the agreement with the multiplicity function and small - scale correlation function , relative to a pure @xmath2 change with no freedom in the hod .",
    "as argued earlier , the shape parameter @xmath3 is largely decoupled from the strong cosmological degeneracy between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : matrix ] also shows that clustering observables are insensitive to some hod parameters , most notably @xmath380 and @xmath381 , which describe the low - mass end of the mean occupation function .",
    "we reached similar conclusions from our analysis of @xmath97 constraints in  [ sec : fixed ] and the effect of a @xmath109 prior in  [ sec : general ] .",
    "the insensitivity of clustering observables to these parameters means that it is difficult to constrain them with clustering data .",
    "however , this insensitivity also means that poor knowledge of these parameters does not introduce uncertainty in the cosmological conclusions .",
    "we have also investigated the influence matrix for a simpler hod parameterization in which the mean satellite occupation function is a truncated power - law ( @xcite ) .",
    "the influence vector of the power - law normalization is similar to that of @xmath377 in figure  [ fig : matrix ] , while the influence vector of the power - law slope is similar in overall form but with a different mass and length - scale dependence , reflecting its differential impact on high- and low - mass halos .",
    "the influence of the low - mass cutoff is , again , weak .",
    "the halo occupation function @xmath96 is , by definition , a distribution weighted by halo number , the probability that a randomly selected halo of mass @xmath15 contains @xmath16 galaxies .",
    "our clustering calculations implicitly assume that this distribution and other parameters of the hod like @xmath120 and @xmath95 are independent of the larger scale environment .",
    "a systematic dependence of a halo s galaxy occupation on the overdensity @xmath195 of its surroundings would alter the clustering predicted for a given halo population and ( number - averaged ) @xmath96 .",
    "ignoring this dependence could therefore lead one to infer an incorrect hod or incorrect cosmological parameters when fitting observed galaxy clustering .",
    "the assumption of an environment - independent hod is rooted partly in the @xcite excursion set derivation of the extended press - schechter formalism .",
    "this derivation predicts that the statistical features of a halo s assembly history depend only on its present mass , a point emphasized by @xcite . in agreement with this prediction",
    ", @xcite and @xcite found that @xmath16-body halos of fixed mass in different environments have similar properties and formation histories , although @xcite found a subtle trend for close pairs of halos to have higher formation redshifts .",
    "the resolution of the simulations used in these studies effectively limited them to halo masses @xmath25 .",
    "two recent studies @xcite , based on the higher resolution , millennium run @xmath16-body simulation @xcite , show that the correlation between halo formation time and large - scale environment becomes much stronger for halo masses @xmath382 . to the extent that galaxy properties depend on halo formation time and halo mass , this correlation will in turn produce an environmental dependence of @xmath96 .",
    "there are several reasons for thinking that the quantitative impact of such a dependence is small , at least for galaxy samples defined by simple thresholds in luminosity or baryonic mass . empirically ,",
    "@xcite show that the correlation of sdss galaxy properties with galaxy overdensity on a scale of @xmath20 can be entirely explained by the correlation with overdensity on the @xmath383 scale characteristic of large halos ; at fixed local overdensity , they detect no residual correlation with the larger scale environment . on the theoretical side , @xcite",
    "show that the hod ( more precisely , the mean occupation function ) of galaxies above a baryonic mass threshold in @xcite s ( @xcite ) cosmological hydrodynamic simulation is independent of environment within the statistical uncertainties imposed by the @xmath384 simulation volume .",
    "@xcite , analyzing the same simulation , show that explicitly eliminating any environmental dependence by randomly shuffling the galaxy populations among halos of similar mass changes the galaxy - galaxy and galaxy - matter correlation functions by @xmath385 on scales @xmath386 , again within the statistical uncertainties . in a similar experiment using semi - analytic galaxy populations in the millennium",
    "run simulation , @xcite find that the correlation functions of luminosity - bin samples change by a few percent ; because of the large simulation volume , these shifts are measured with high precision .",
    "since we hope in the long term to achieve few percent precision on cosmological parameter measurements , the millennium run results imply that environmental dependence of the hod must eventually be considered as part of the program outlined in this paper . allowing arbitrary dependence of @xmath96 on large - scale overdensity @xmath195",
    "would probably make the problem intractable and degenerate , but given the small magnitude of the anticipated effects , a more restricted parameterization should suffice . for example , since the age dependence of halo clustering is found mainly in the mass range of individual galaxy halos , it may well be enough to allow @xmath102 to vary with @xmath195 , or to treat the effective bias parameter of low - mass halos as a parameter to be fitted instead of using the standard @xmath16-body result .",
    "since much of the signal in most clustering statistics comes from multi - galaxy halos , addition of such parameters may not have much impact on the achievable constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "semi - analytic mock catalogs will be valuable in guiding the choice of parameterizations and in testing whether fitting methods that adopt a particular parameterization ( or that ignore environmental variations altogether ) yield incorrect estimates of hod or cosmological parameters .    for cosmological applications , it will be desirable to work with galaxy samples defined by properties that are sensitive to halo mass and relatively insensitive to formation history , such as stellar mass or luminosity in a band dominated by old stellar populations . color - selected or morphologically selected samples will be more susceptible to environmental dependence of halo formation history at fixed mass .",
    "conversely , samples with high luminosity or mass thresholds may be the least susceptible , since the correlation of formation time with environment is weak for high - mass halos .",
    "while the breakdown of the @xcite prediction is an annoyance for the cosmological applications that are the focus of this paper , it could be an asset for efforts to understand the physical processes that determine galaxy morphology and spectral properties .",
    "for example , if fitting the clustering of a selected class of galaxies _ requires _ environmental dependence of the hod , then the form and magnitude of that dependence will provide strong clues to the aspects of halo formation that determine whether galaxies are members of that class .",
    "conversely , if the color and morphology dependence of observed clustering can be entirely explained without environmental variations of the hod , it will imply that aspects of halo formation that correlate with environment do not play a strong role in determining these properties of galaxies .",
    "our analysis shows that hod modeling can substantially increase the cosmological power of galaxy clustering measurements , by breaking degeneracies between the clustering of dark matter and the bias of galaxies with respect to mass .",
    "changing the shape or amplitude of the matter power spectrum or the value of @xmath1 alters the mass function , spatial clustering , and velocity statistics of the dark halo population in well - understood ways @xcite .",
    "our experiments here , which verify the qualitative arguments of @xcite and @xcite , show that changes to the galaxy hod can not mask these changes in the underlying dark halo population . with our highly flexible parameterization of the hod , the set of observables considered here yields @xmath5 uncertainties of @xmath4 in @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 and @xmath7 uncertainty in the combination @xmath387 with @xmath388 .",
    "we expect these forecasts to be conservative , as we have not included observables for which we did not have ready analytic approximations , and our assumption of 10% measurement errors is pessimistic in at least some cases .",
    "the physical origin of these cosmological constraints is straightforward to understand for simple changes in @xmath1 , @xmath2 , or @xmath270 , as discussed in   [ sec : omegam]-[sec : clnorm ] .",
    "the general theme of these discussions is that , for a given cosmological model , the spatial clustering of galaxies largely determines the number of galaxies in halos of a given spatial abundance .",
    "dynamically sensitive statistics then reveal the halo mass scale , which depends on @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "we allow an arbitrary bias @xmath95 between the galaxy and dark matter velocity dispersions within halos , but this freedom does not eliminate the constraining power of dynamical observables because the space velocities of the halos themselves do not change .",
    "the main parameter degeneracy is approximately @xmath389 because fixing this combination roughly fixes the halo velocity scale and the abundance of halos at the mass scale of rich galaxy groups .",
    "however , the changing shape of the mass function , the differing sensitivities of different velocity measures , and the different @xmath390 dependence of galaxy - galaxy lensing all serve to break this degeneracy . figures  [ fig : chgerr ] and  [ fig : matrix ] demonstrate that the cosmological constraints emerge from the full web of clustering observables and are not dominated by one or two statistics on their own .    constraints on the galaxy hod will themselves provide valuable tests of galaxy formation models .",
    "the cutoff regime of @xmath97 is difficult to pin down with the clustering statistics considered here , but for a known cosmological model the relation between average satellite number and halo mass is well determined , and the satellite distribution width @xmath112 , concentration @xmath118 , and velocity bias @xmath95 are measured to @xmath4 , 30% , and 3% , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mcmc_hodpar ] ) .",
    "all of these quantities depend in detail on the physics that governs the evolution of satellites in larger halos ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , while the relative mass of halos that host central and satellite galaxies depends on the efficiency with which halos feed baryonic mass to their central objects ( see , e.g , discussions by @xcite ) .",
    "these galaxy formation constraints will be especially powerful when derived as a function of luminosity , stellar mass , or other observables .",
    "the two main assumptions built into our modeling are the central - satellite parameterization and environment independence of the hod .",
    "the central - satellite distinction appears well rooted in galaxy formation physics , and it allows us to represent the range of plausible galaxy hods more completely with a moderate number of parameters .",
    "however , we have confirmed with other tests that if we model galaxy bias with a flexible hod parameterization that does not impose a central - satellite distinction , but instead introduces a characteristic mass for the narrow - to - wide transition of @xmath96 as in @xcite , then we reach almost identical conclusions about the cosmological constraining power of the clustering observables considered in this paper .",
    "recent numerical results imply an environmental dependence of halo formation times that opens the door to environmental variation of the hod , especially in the single - galaxy regime . as discussed in  [ sec : environment ] , we expect the quantitative impact of such dependence to be small , but potentially significant at the high level of precision we ultimately hope to attain .",
    "investigation of environmental dependence effects and methods of allowing for them in hod modeling are a high priority for future work .    the cosmological modeling approach advocated here is closely related to the clf method introduced by @xcite and @xcite , who use clustering data and the global galaxy luminosity function to constrain the dependence of the luminosity function on halo mass . in principle , the clf and hod methods are equivalent",
    " they are merely differential and integral forms of one another",
    ". one can derive the clf from a series of hod fits to galaxy samples with different luminosity thresholds @xcite .",
    "conversely , one can integrate the clf to infer @xmath97 for galaxies above a luminosity threshold @xcite .",
    "the principal virtue of our hod - based approach is that by focusing on a single , well - defined class of galaxies , we can parameterize the hod in a way that seems likely to capture the predictions of any reasonable galaxy formation model .",
    "this kind of comprehensive parameterization is more difficult to achieve for the full clf , and most analyses to date have assumed , for example , that the clf has a schechter form in halos of fixed mass .",
    "nonetheless , it is valuable to pursue both hod and clf approaches and test for consistency of conclusions .",
    "hod modeling complements rather than replaces the perturbative approach based on large - scale measures that can be modeled with linear or quadratic bias .",
    "hod modeling is more complex , but it can take advantage of high - precision clustering measurements on small and intermediate scales .",
    "hod modeling can also amplify the power of the perturbative approach , extending its reach further into the non - linear regime and checking its range of validity at a desired level of precision .",
    "for example , @xcite show that an hod - based approach to redshift - space distortions can improve recovery of the perturbative parameter @xmath39 that controls large - scale flows .",
    "@xcite show that the linear bias model provides an accurate description of galaxy - galaxy lensing for @xmath391 , and they show how to accurately model this phenomenon on smaller scales ( see also @xcite ) . j. yoo et al .",
    "( 2007 , in preparation ) show that the scale - dependent bias factors derived by fitting the projected galaxy correlation function can extend recovery of the shape of the linear matter power spectrum into the mildly non - linear regime .",
    "clf and hod analyses of the 2dfgrs and sdss redshift surveys have already produced a number of interesting results , even though they have considered only a fraction of the potential clustering observables .",
    "these results confirm , at least qualitatively , many of the basic predictions of current galaxy formation models , including the general form of the mean occupation function , the dependence of this function on luminosity , the existence of a minimum mass - to - light ratio in the halos of @xmath392 galaxies where galaxy formation is most efficient , the large gap between the minimum halo mass for central and satellite galaxies above a luminosity threshold , the sub - poisson fluctuations of @xmath96 that are a consequence of this gap , and the strong preference of galaxies with older stellar populations for higher mass halos @xcite . in combination with cmb data , the cosmological constraints from hod modeling of the sdss projected galaxy correlation function are almost as tight as those from the large - scale galaxy power spectrum , and the two analyses are consistent within their statistical uncertainties @xcite .",
    "for the most part , the cosmological inferences from clf / hod modeling of galaxy clustering agree with those from other methods , but matching the mass - to - light ratios of galaxy clusters simultaneously with other clustering data appears to require values of @xmath1 and/or @xmath2 that are substantially lower than the commonly adopted values of 0.3 and 0.9 @xcite .",
    "if this conclusion is correct , then the evidence for it should become much stronger as more clustering observables are brought into play and the sdss data set itself moves to completion .    we have focused in this paper on the cosmological parameter constraints that can be derived from galaxy clustering alone , using external data only to guide the choice of power spectrum shape and motivate the assumption of gaussian initial conditions . as with perturbative analyses of large - scale structure , the long - term interest lies in combining these constraints with those from the cmb , the ly@xmath11 forest , type ia supernovae , and other cosmological observables . the complementary sensitivities of these observables lead to much tighter parameter constraints .",
    "more importantly , conflicts among them could point the way to physics beyond the simplest versions of @xmath43cdm , such as evolving dark energy , a gravitational wave contribution to cmb anisotropy , departures from scale invariance in the primordial power spectrum , non - zero space curvature , cosmologically significant neutrino masses , and so forth . by sharpening the constraints from large - scale structure in the new generation of galaxy redshift surveys ,",

    "<S> adopting the framework of the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) , we investigate the ability of galaxy clustering measurements to simultaneously constrain cosmological parameters and galaxy bias . starting with a fiducial cosmological model and galaxy hod , we calculate spatial clustering observables on a range of length and mass scales , dynamical clustering observables that depend on galaxy peculiar velocities , and the galaxy - matter cross - correlation measurable by weak lensing . </S>",
    "<S> we then change one or more cosmological parameters and use @xmath0-minimization to find the galaxy hod that best reproduces the original clustering . </S>",
    "<S> our parameterization of the hod incorporates a flexible relation between galaxy occupation numbers and halo mass and allows spatial and velocity bias of galaxies within dark matter halos . despite this flexibility , we find that changes to the hod can not mask substantial changes to the matter density @xmath1 , the matter clustering amplitude @xmath2 , or the shape parameter @xmath3 of the linear matter power spectrum  cosmology and bias are not degenerate . with the conservative assumption of 10% fractional errors , the set of observables considered here can provide @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) constraints on @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 , using galaxy clustering data _ alone_. the combination @xmath6 is constrained to @xmath7 . in combination with traditional methods that focus on large - scale structure in the `` perturbative '' regime , hod modeling can greatly amplify the cosmological power of galaxy redshift surveys by taking advantage of high - precision clustering measurements at small and intermediate scales ( from sub - mpc to @xmath8 ) . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , the inferred constraints on the galaxy hod provide valuable tests of galaxy formation theory . </S>"
