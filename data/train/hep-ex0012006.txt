    "fnal e791 is a hadroproduction experiment studying the weak decays of charm mesons and baryons .",
    "the charm particles were produced by impinging a 500  gev/@xmath9 @xmath10 beam on five thin target foils . the most upstream foil consisted of platinum ; the other foils consisted of carbon .",
    "all foils were separated by about 15  mm such that @xmath2 mesons decayed predominately in the air gaps between foils .",
    "the experiment took data from september , 1991 to january 1992 , recording the world s largest sample of charm decays at that time .",
    "the number of reconstructed events is over 200000 . with this data sample",
    "the experiment has studied charm production @xcite , charm lifetimes @xcite , rare and forbidden @xmath2 decays @xcite , @xmath0-@xmath1  mixing @xcite , cp  violation @xcite , and several other topics .",
    "here we focus on the following : _ ( a ) _  searches for @xmath0-@xmath1  mixing in semileptonic @xmath3 decays and in hadronic @xmath4 and @xmath5 decays ; _ ( b ) _",
    "measurement of the doubly - cabibbo - suppressed decay @xmath11 ; _ ( c ) _  search for cp  violation in neutral @xmath6 decays and in charged @xmath7 decays ; _ ( d ) _  measurement of the width difference @xmath8 between the two mass - eigenstates of the @xmath0-@xmath1  system .",
    "these results are published in refs .",
    "@xcite . throughout this paper , charge - conjugate modes are included unless otherwise noted",
    ".    the experimental apparatus consisted of a silicon vertex detector followed by a two - magnet spectrometer , two segmented cerenkov counters for hadron identification , an electromagnetic calorimeter for electron identification , and iron shielding followed by scintillator counters for muon identification .",
    "the silicon vertex detector consisted of 17 planes of silicon and was used to reconstruct decay vertices downstream from the interaction vertex .",
    "the spectrometer consisted of 35 planes of drift chambers and two proportional wire chambers .",
    "the two dipole magnets bent particles in the horizontal plane and had @xmath12  kicks of + 212  gev/@xmath9 and + 320  gev/@xmath9 .",
    "the cerenkov counters contained gases with different indices of refraction ; together they provided @xmath13 discrimination over the momentum range 660  gev/@xmath9 .",
    "more details about the detector can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "data was recorded using a loose transverse energy trigger .",
    "after reconstruction , events with evidence of well - separated interaction and decay vertices were retained for further analysis .",
    "some of the main criteria used to select charm decays are listed in table  [ tab : cuts ] .",
    "the most important criterion is that of @xmath14 , defined as the distance between the interaction and decay vertices divided by the error in this quantity .",
    "values used for this criterion ranged from 8 ( for @xmath0 and @xmath15 decays ) to 20 ( for longer - lived @xmath16 decays ) .    .main",

    "we have searched for @xmath0-@xmath1  mixing in both semileptonic and hadronic @xmath0 decays and see no evidence for it .",
    "we subsequently set 90% cl upper limits @xmath17@xmath180.50% and @xmath17@xmath180.85% , respectively . assuming the mixing amplitude to be negligibly small ( as predicted by the standard model )",
    ", we fit our data for the rate of dcs decays @xmath4 and @xmath5 , obtaining @xmath19% and @xmath20% .",
    "these results are consistent with the rate we measure for the dcs charged decay @xmath11 : @xmath21% .",
    "we have also searched for cp  violation in neutral @xmath6 decays and in charged @xmath7 decays .",
