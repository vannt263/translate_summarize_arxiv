    "recent gamma ray and cosmic ray observations give increasing evidence that the sources of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) and of cosmic rays ( crs ) with energy @xmath10 are cosmological ( see @xcite for grb observations review ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for crs ) .",
    "the sources of both phenomena , however , remain unknown . in particular , most of the cr sources discussed so far have difficulties in accelerating crs up to the highest observed energies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although the source of grbs is unknown , their observational characteristics impose strong constraints on the physical conditions in the @xmath9-ray emitting region ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which imply that protons may be accelerated in this region to energies @xmath11 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the average rate ( over volume and time ) at which energy is emitted as @xmath9-rays by grbs and in crs above @xmath12 in the cosmological scenario is , remarkably , comparable ( @xcite , b ) .",
    "these two facts suggest that grbs and high - energy crs may have a common origin .",
    "an essential ingredient of the grb model for crs is the time delay due to intergalactic magnetic fields .",
    "the energy of the most energetic cr detected by the fly s eye experiment is in excess of @xmath13 ( @xcite ) , and that of the most energetic agasa event is above @xmath0 ( @xcite ) . on a cosmological scale ,",
    "the distance traveled by such energetic particles is small : @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) for the agasa ( fly s eye ) event ( e.g. , @xcite ) . thus , the detection of these events over a @xmath16 period can be reconciled with the rate of nearby grbs , @xmath17 per @xmath18 in the field of view of the cr experiments out to @xmath19 in a standard cosmological scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ) , only if there is a large dispersion , @xmath1 , in the arrival time of protons produced in a single burst ( note , that this implies that if a direct correlation between high energy cr events and grbs , as recently suggested by @xcite , is observed on a @xmath20 time scale , it would be strong evidence _ against _ a cosmological grb hypothesis ) . the required dispersion may result from deflections of cr protons by the inter - galactic magnetic field ( @xcite ) .",
    "the inter - galactic magnetic field ( igmf ) has not been detected so far .",
    "faraday - rotation measures set an upper limit of @xmath21 for a field with @xmath22 correlation length ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "other methods have recently been proposed to probe fields in the range @xmath23@xmath24 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical considerations regarding the existence and strength of the igmf are related to the formation of the observed @xmath25 fields in galaxies .",
    "recent studies suggest that a galactic dynamo can not produce the observed large - scale fields in galactic disks ( @xcite ) and that one must turn to alternative mechanisms , which typically rely on a pre - existing field .",
    "galactic fields might be created , for example , by compression of much weaker fields in collapsing protogalactic regions .",
    "this mechanism requires a protogalactic field of strength @xmath26@xmath27 and correlation length of order @xmath28 .",
    "such fields could be primordial , in which case they would likely permeate all intergalactic space . however , this need not be the case .",
    "for example , such fields could be generated from a much weaker primordial field , @xmath29  g , due to the turbulence induced in the formation of large scale structure in the universe ( @xcite ) . in this picture , the igmf would `` trace the mass '' , with high @xmath26@xmath27 fields in the high density ( proto - galactic ) regions of the large scale structure and very low fields in the intervening voids .",
    "most of the energy lost by the crs as they propagate and interact with the microwave background is transformed by cascading into secondary gev - tev photons ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this _",
    "letter _ we show that even though the cr time delay must be @xmath30 , a significant fraction of the gev - tev cascade radiation can arrive with much shorter delays , on the order of hours to days , provided that a large fraction of the inter - galactic space is occupied by magnetic `` voids '' , regions of very low magnetic field ( @xmath31 g ) . in ",
    "2 we present a qualitative discussion of the development of electro - magnetic cascades in the presence of an igmf .",
    "the expected high energy photon flux is calculated using detailed monte - carlo simulations in  3 .",
    "implications for current and future high energy gamma - ray experiments are discussed in  4 .",
    "as they propagate , nucleons with energy in excess of @xmath0 lose energy due to the photo - production of pions in interactions with microwave background photons .",
    "pion decay converts @xmath32 of the energy lost by nucleons to neutrinos , and the rest to photons , electrons and positrons .",
    "the energetic , @xmath33 , secondary photons , electrons and positrons further interact with the microwave background to form electromagnetic cascades : high energy photons interact with background photons and produce electron - positron pairs , which , in turn , lose their energy by inverse - compton scattering of background photons .",
    "the mean energy of the secondary photons is degraded until it drops below the threshold for pair production , @xmath34 for interaction with microwave photons .",
    "the development of an electro - magnetic cascade , typically over a @xmath35 distance , converts most of the secondary particles energy to @xmath36 photons . the distance out to which @xmath37 cascade photons may be observed is limited since they may further interact with infrared background photons .",
    "current limits on the infrared background radiation energy density constrain the mean free path for pair production on infrared photons to lie in the range @xmath38 for @xmath39 photons and @xmath40 for @xmath41 photons ( @xcite ) .",
    "we now estimate the arrival time delays of cascade photons resulting from deflections by the igmf of the protons initiating the cascades and of the pairs produced during the cascades .",
    "we consider the propagation of protons and secondary particles through an igmf where a fraction @xmath42 of intergalactic space is occupied by structures of typical size @xmath43 and coherent magnetic field @xmath44 , and where the rest of space is filled with a much weaker field .",
    "first , consider the deflection of a proton with energy @xmath45 after traveling a distance @xmath46 through the igmf , the proton accumulates a typical deflection angle @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the larmor radius .",
    "this deflection results in a time delay @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51,@xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( the @xmath55 factor is due to random field orientations ) . for igmf parameters that might be expected in models where galactic fields result from the compression of an igmf produced by turbulence induced in the formation of large - scale structure , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 ,",
    "the time delay accumulated by cr protons propagating @xmath59 distance is large enough to reconcile the observed cr event rate with the rate of nearby grbs ( @xmath60 depends sensitively on @xmath61 , so that the stochastic proton energy loss via pion production results in a broadening of the cr pulse over a time comparable to @xmath60 . )",
    "the time delay for cascade photons may be much shorter than the cr delay , since the protons lose a significant fraction of their energy over a distance much shorter than the @xmath59 distance over which they accumulate their total time delay .",
    "protons of initial energy @xmath62 lose @xmath63 of their energy , and therefore initiate electro - magnetic cascades carrying @xmath64 of the total cascade radiation energy , over a distance @xmath65 .",
    "if the secondary photons and subsequent cascade particles produced in these cascades were to propagate rectilinearly to the observer , the time delay of the resulting cascade photons would be @xmath66 if the burst went off in a high field region , or much shorter if the burst happened to go off in a region of low field . if bursts occur inside galaxies , regions of potentially much higher field ( @xmath67 on a kpc scale ) , the initial time delay accumulated by @xmath68 protons as they traverse and leave the host galaxy is only @xmath69 day .",
    "the pairs produced in a cascade are also subject to deflection by the igmf , and this can lead to much larger photon arrival time delays .",
    "the compton energy loss distance for pairs of energy @xmath70 ( corresponding to the high , low energy ends of the cascade ) , is @xmath71 .",
    "if these pairs were created in a high field region , their deflection by the magnetic field , @xmath72 , would delay subsequent cascade photons by @xmath73 .",
    "thus , the only photons arriving with reasonably short time delays are those produced by branches of the cascades where pairs were produced in igmf voids .",
    "( a minimum delay shorter than day requires a `` void '' field @xmath74 )",
    ". the following characteristics of electro - magnetic cascades development ensure , that a significant fraction of the cascade photons are produced by such branches , provided that a large fraction of the inter - galactic space is occupied by large scale , @xmath75 , voids .",
    "the distance over which cr protons decelerate , @xmath35 , and the mean free paths of photons at the high - energy ( @xmath76 ) part of the cascade , @xmath77 , are comparable to or larger than the typical size of the high field regions .",
    "this ensures that a significant fraction of the cascades are initiated inside voids , and also implies that , at the high energy end of the cascade , a particular cascade branch can `` skip '' over high field regions without accumulating time delay .",
    "the short mean free paths of particles at the low energy part of the cascade , @xmath78 for @xmath79 , then imply that the development of a branch , whose @xmath80 particles are created in a void region , is likely to be completed in this region .",
    "we now present numerical results for the flux of delayed cascade photons expected in an igmf where a large fraction of inter - galactic space is occupied by large - scale voids , and the field strength in the high field regions is high enough to produce a @xmath6 delay in the cr arrival time .",
    "we constructed a monte carlo code that propagates high energy nucleons through the microwave background and calculates the evolution of the cascades they initiate .",
    "all the relevant particle interaction processes are included , and the gyration of charged particles about the igmf is explicitly calculated .",
    "since we are only interested in source distances of order @xmath81 , cosmological evolution effects were not included .",
    "the cosmic background radiation field was chosen to be a superposition of : ( i ) a blackbody of temperature @xmath82 ; ( ii ) an infrared / optical power law distribution at energies @xmath83 with density @xmath84 , corresponding to the lower bound of current estimates of the intensity ; ( iii ) a truncated power law distribution at radio energies with density @xmath85 { \\rm cm}^{-3 } { \\rm ev}^{-1}$ ] ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our results depend only weakly on the radio background intensity , since the cascades are initiated by particles with energies @xmath86 , for which interaction with the radio background is only marginally important .",
    "the infrared / optical radiation does not influence significantly the @xmath87 flux , but may strongly affect the flux at higher energies .",
    "this is further addressed below .",
    "we generated several igmf structures by sampling the sizes of high(low ) field regions along the line of sight from exponential size distribution with mean @xmath88(@xmath89 ) .",
    "the field in each region was randomly oriented with magnitude @xmath90 in the high field regions and @xmath24 in the `` void '' regions ( the `` void '' field can be as high as @xmath91 without significantly affecting the results shown ) . the resulting distributions for @xmath92 cr arrival time delays",
    "are shown in fig . 1 for five different realizations of the igmf .",
    "the source was chosen to be at a distance of @xmath5 , and assumed to produce a power law proton spectrum @xmath93 in the range @xmath94 @xmath95 .",
    "the corresponding photon fluences above @xmath39 are shown in fig .",
    "the fluence is normalized for a burst producing @xmath96 in @xmath97 protons , as would be required to account for the observed cr flux .",
    "the cascade radiation spectrum is determined by the development of the low energy end of the cascade , and is therefore independent of the proton production spectrum . for the short time delays of interest here ,",
    "the low energy development of the relevant cascade branches always occurs in void regions .",
    "thus , the spectrum is similar to that obtained in the absence of an igmf and is time independent . the integral photon number flux ( above energy @xmath98 )",
    "is approximately given by @xmath99 for @xmath100 , @xmath101 for @xmath102 , and @xmath103 for @xmath104 .",
    "the spread in the typical cr time delay obtained for different field structure realizations is small , since this delay is accumulated over a @xmath5 propagation .",
    "the spread in the photon fluence obtained on a time scale of days is larger , since it is determined by the igmf structure near the source , at distances @xmath105 , where the development of most of the relevant electro - magnetic cascades take place : the highest fluence was obtained for a case where the first @xmath106 were free of high field regions , and the lowest for a case where @xmath107 of the first @xmath106 were occupied by two @xmath75 high field regions .",
    "this reflects the results of a large set of monte - carlo calculations , which show that for @xmath58 and void regions size in the range @xmath108@xmath89 , the fluence increases from @xmath109 to @xmath110 as the fraction of the volume occupied by high field regions within @xmath106 from the source decreases from @xmath111 to @xmath112 .",
    "the presence of a host galaxy near the burst is expected to introduce a minimum delay of order @xmath113 in the cascade photon arrival times , and is not expected to significantly affect the fluence on longer time scales .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig . 2 by the two monte - carlo calculations , shown with the heavy lines , one of which includes a @xmath114 magnetic field over the first @xmath115 propagation distance to simulate the effect of a host galaxy magnetic field .",
    "it should be noted that the host galaxy delay can be considerably shorter if the burst produces a significant amount of energy in protons with energies @xmath116 , for which a host galaxy would introduce only a @xmath117 delay .",
    "photons arriving with @xmath118 delay are produced by cascades initiated by pions created over the first @xmath89 propagation distance of the protons .",
    "most of these pions are produced by protons with energy @xmath119 , which lose @xmath120 their energy over this distance .",
    "the typical @xmath121 fluence obtained on a day time scale , @xmath110 ( @xmath122 ) , corresponds to @xmath123 of the energy produced by the burst as @xmath119 protons .",
    "although a scenario in which crs above @xmath0 are produced by cosmological grbs requires the arrival time of crs to be delayed with respect to the @xmath9-rays by more than @xmath124 , we have shown that the delay of secondary , @xmath125 cascade photons may be much smaller .",
    "a short delay is possible provided that a large fraction of the inter - galactic medium is occupied by large - scale magnetic `` voids '' , regions of size @xmath2 and field weaker than @xmath3 . for a field strength of @xmath4 in the high - field inter - galactic regions , which would account for the observed galactic fields",
    "if it were frozen in the protogalactic plasma , the delay of crs produced by a burst at a distance of @xmath5 is @xmath6 . at the same time",
    ", the fluence of secondary @xmath121 photons on a @xmath113 time scale would be @xmath110 , provided that @xmath126 of the @xmath106 region around the source is occupied by magnetic `` voids '' ( the fluence is inversely proportional to the burst distance squared , since the photon time delay is independent of the burst distance ) .",
    "the integral photon number flux in the energy range @xmath127 is approximately @xmath101 .",
    "the flux at higher energies is very sensitive to the infrared background intensity .",
    "if the intensity is near the lower bound of current estimates , the flux extends beyond @xmath128 , approximately as @xmath103 .",
    "if the intensity is close to its current upper bound , it would completely suppress the @xmath129 flux from distances @xmath130 .",
    "a @xmath131 detection of @xmath132 photons by current high - energy @xmath9-ray experiments requires a fluence @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the observation time measured in days and @xmath135 is the detector threshold energy in tev ( see @xcite for cygnus , @xcite for hegra , @xcite for casa - mia , @xcite for whipple ) .",
    "this fluence is close to that expected from a burst at a distance of @xmath59 .",
    "however , in a cosmological model , the rate at which grbs occur in a @xmath5 sphere around us is low , @xmath136 .",
    "a factor of @xmath137 increase in the sensitivity of tev detectors , as expected for example in the near future in the whipple and hegra observatories , would allow the detection of the delayed flux from bursts occuring at distances up to @xmath138 .",
    "the rate of such bursts is @xmath139 .    lower threshold energy , space - based detectors such as egret",
    "may also detect the delayed flux . at @xmath7",
    ", egret has an effective area of @xmath140 .",
    "thus , for the @xmath141 fluence expected from a burst at a @xmath5 distance , @xmath142 in one day , the probability that egret detects a @xmath141 photon is @xmath143 .",
    "this probability , although not negligible , is small . therefore , detection of the delayed flux would probably require next - generation gev instruments , such as glast ( @xcite ) , that are expected to have order of magnitude better sensitivity [ it should be noted , however , that egret has detected a @xmath144 photon from the direction of one of the strongest batse bursts ( second in fluence ) , with @xmath145 delay ( @xcite ) ] .    we thanks b. funk for valuable comments and information about hegra .",
