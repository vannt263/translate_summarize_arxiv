    "antiproton - proton annihilations leading to final states containing light - quark structures constitute very attractive and powerful tools for the study of the spectroscopy of @xmath13 mesons , glueballs , and hybrids .",
    "indeed , major contributions to light - quark spectroscopy have been made by the study of @xmath14 interactions with stopped and low energy antiprotons @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report a study of the isoscalar and isovector light quark resonances populated in the reaction @xmath0 in the collision of 5.2 gev / c antiprotons with protons at rest .",
    "the reaction is very selective .",
    "it can only populate @xmath13 states with @xmath15 , isoscalar , or @xmath16-states decaying into @xmath5 , and isovector , or @xmath17-states decaying into @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath5 states may contain admixtures of low lying @xmath18 and @xmath19 glueballs , and the @xmath7 states may include states with non-@xmath13 @xmath20 , such as the @xmath21 hybrids .",
    "in the spectroscopy of light - quark mesons there remain many open questions .",
    "theoretical calculations @xcite for states with angular momentum @xmath22 predict twelve @xmath4-states , and six @xmath6-states in the mass range 1 gev-2.5 gev .",
    "in addition , two glueball states , with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and at least one manifestly exotic @xmath25 hybrid with @xmath26 , @xmath27 are predicted in this mass range . in different experiments",
    "many @xmath10 and @xmath28 states have been claimed , but pdg04 @xcite considers only four @xmath10 states , four @xmath28 states , and five @xmath29 to be established well enough to be included in the meson summary list . in the present investigation we present new determinations of masses and @xmath20 of several of the established @xmath4 and @xmath6 states , and",
    "provide evidence for several previously unconfirmed states .",
    "in the present analysis data from fermilab @xmath30 annihilation experiment e835 is used .",
    "the stored and cooled antiprotons circulating in the fermilab antiproton accumulator intersect a hydrogen cluster jet gas target , and the reaction products are detected in a detector system which surrounds the interaction region .",
    "full details of the detector and its performance can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "photons are detected in the lead glass central detector in the angular range @xmath31 and @xmath32 in @xmath33 , with an energy resolution of @xmath34 .",
    "luminosity was measured by detecting recoil protons at @xmath35 .",
    "the data were collected at @xmath36 momenta of 5.2 gev / c corresponding to center of mass energy range of @xmath37 gev with a total luminosity of @xmath38 .",
    "the reaction studied was @xmath39 twenty two million six photon events were recorded in the full detector , of which 3.25 million were fully contained in the fiducial volume , had no photons in the forward calorimeter , and met the energy - momentum ( 4c ) constraint with probability @xmath40 .",
    "of these , 139,500 events passed @xmath3 seven constraint fit with @xmath41 .",
    "these events were then subjected to three anticuts. events which met the hypotheses for the contaminant final states ( @xmath42 ) , ( @xmath43 ) or ( @xmath44 ) with @xmath45 were removed , and the final sample of 83,400 events was used for the dalitz plot analysis . the dalitz plot and its @xmath5 and @xmath7 projections",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ dalitz ] .",
    "these mass distributions differ completely from the phase space distributions which are predicted to be essentially flat over the entire @xmath46 gev/@xmath47 mass region for both @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "visible structures appear to correspond in the @xmath5 diagonal to @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and a complex of states in the mass region of @xmath50 mev .",
    "the visible horizontal and vertical @xmath7 bands appear to correspond to @xmath51 and a state around 1300 mev .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the anticuts described above remove events and introduce distortions in specific regions of the dalitz plot .",
    "the effect of the @xmath52 anticut was large , but mostly confined to the diagonal edge of the dalitz plot in the @xmath53 region .",
    "the effect of the @xmath54 anticut was smaller and also largely confined to the @xmath53 and @xmath55 regions .",
    "the effect of @xmath56 anticut was small , and was mainly in the vicinity of @xmath57 .",
    "monte carlo simulation were done to estimate feed - down contributions from 7 and 8 photon reaction with one and two missing photons , respectively , which remain in our final event selection .",
    "it was found that the contributions of @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) % , and @xmath60 ( @xmath61)% , were mostly confined to the diagonal edge of the dalitz plot , in the region of @xmath53 and @xmath55 .",
    "the contributions of @xmath62 was estimated as ( @xmath63)% , and was mostly confined to the region around @xmath57 .",
    "the overall efficiency of our @xmath3 selection was estimated by mc simulation to be ( @xmath64)% .",
    "taking account of the feed - down contributions in the total yield , we obtain the total cross section corresponding to the @xmath3 events in the dalitz plot , @xmath65 @xmath66 .",
    "( -1.4,4.2 ) ( 4.0,4.2 )   ( 4.0,4.2 )      ( -1.4,4.2 ) ( 4.0,4.2 )   ( 4.0,4.2 )",
    "the reaction @xmath0 is described in the isobar model as a two step process , @xmath67 , or @xmath68 , followed by @xmath69 , and @xmath70 . in principle both the production and the decay of @xmath4 and @xmath6 should be independently taken into account . in practice , this is not possible . at an incident antiproton momentum of 5.2 gev/@xmath71 ,",
    "@xmath72 annihilation involves angular momentum up to @xmath73 in the initial state .",
    "this makes it essentially impossible to use the full helicity formalism for the analysis of our data .",
    "instead , we use the decay formalism developed and successfully used in several dalitz plot analyses of the crystal barrel @xmath72 annihilation data at 1.94 gev/@xmath71 @xcite .",
    "in addition , we take account of the production amplitudes in an average way by parameterizing them as a function of even powers of @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the resonance production angle with respect to the @xmath76 direction , @xmath77 .",
    "the final amplitude for the formation and decay of a resonance with spin @xmath78 , projection @xmath79 , mass @xmath80 and width @xmath81 is the given by @xmath82        although the observation of the isoscalars @xmath83 and @xmath84 has been reported before , pdg04 considers them unconfirmed .",
    "we find @xmath83 and @xmath84 with masses and widths listed in the table [ tab : b ] to be strongly populated with nearly equal intensity .",
    "once again the @xmath18 assignments are preferred for both over @xmath19 assignments by @xmath85 and 22 , respectively . in a global analysis of the crystal barrel data for momenta 900 - 1900 mev / c anisovich _",
    "@xcite identify these two scalars decaying into @xmath5 as having mass / width of @xmath86 mev and @xmath87 mev , which are in almost exact agreement with ours .",
    "we also note that a combined enhancement of these two states was reported as x(2100 ) decaying into @xmath5 by the earlier fermilab e760 experiment @xcite .",
    "its @xmath20 was not determined .",
    "_    although ten @xmath28-states have been reported in our mass region by different experiments , the pdg regards only four , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 as sufficiently well established to be included in the meson summary list .",
    "none of these except @xmath88 have been observed to decay into @xmath5 .",
    "we find no evidence for the excitation of @xmath88 , although it is possible that its resolution is rendered impossible due to the presence of nearby stronger @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath92 plot in fig .",
    "[ f01710](c ) suggests that @xmath93 population is very small , if not zero .",
    "similarly , we find no evidence for @xmath89 .",
    "we confirm the existence of @xmath94 which has been omitted by pdg from its summary list , but which was previously observed to decay into @xmath5 by wa102 @xcite .",
    "our mass and width are in good agreement with both wa102 and the pdg average .",
    "we also observe clear evidence for @xmath91 .",
    "@xcite had claimed this as a doublet , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , in its @xmath95 decay .",
    "we do not find any evidence for such a close mass doublet .",
    "_    we note that we do not find any evidence for the tensor glueball candidate @xmath96 , or @xmath97 decaying into @xmath5 .",
    "this is consistent with the result of the crystal barrel search for the same @xcite .",
    "our fit to the @xmath7 mass spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ best](c ) ) is admittedly poorer compared to the isoscalar state in fig [ best](b )",
    ". it also presents a certain vexing problem concerning the strong enhancement observed at mass @xmath101 mev , which is followed by a dip in the vicinity of 1450 mev .",
    "the @xmath57 is a well established tensor resonance with pdg mass / width , @xmath102 mev .",
    "it is strongly populated in many reactions , and its decays into several channels , including @xmath7 , are well documented @xcite .",
    "a scalar @xmath103 with @xmath104 mev decaying into @xmath7 was reported by cb @xcite in @xmath30 annihilation at rest , and also in @xmath105 @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "obelix @xcite has reported a scalar with @xmath106 in @xmath30 annihilation decaying into @xmath107 , along with a nearly factor five weaker excitation of @xmath57 than what follows from the pdg averages .",
    "we have examined the possible existence of @xmath108 of obelix . as shown in fig . [",
    "f22300a01450](b ) and table [ tab : b ] we obtain a good fit to our data with @xmath57 and @xmath103 , with the best fit @xmath109 parameters for both , @xmath99 : @xmath110 mev and @xmath98 : @xmath111 , both in excellent agreement with the pdg04 values .",
    "paradoxically , an even better fit ( not shown ) is obtained with @xmath108 with @xmath112 mev and @xmath103 with @xmath113 mev . with a 66% ( or @xmath114 ) larger width for @xmath108 than that reported by obelix",
    "( @xmath115 mev versus @xmath116 mev ) it is unlikely that this solution represents their resonance .",
    "however , this still poses the question whether both @xmath57 and @xmath108 can coexist .",
    "we have studied this question at length , considered additional interferences , and conclude that if both resonances exists , it is not possible to resolve them .",
    "we list the results for the @xmath117 assignment in table [ tab : b ] because of the weight of numerous final states , including @xmath118 , in which @xmath57 has been observed , and not @xmath108 .",
    "nevertheless , we must consider the ambiguity between @xmath57 and @xmath108 as unresolved .",
    "we confirm @xmath119 with parameters in excellent agreement with those in pdg04 .",
    "we confirm @xmath120 but find it to have much larger width than pdg04 .",
    "we find a strong resonance , @xmath121 decaying into @xmath118 , with @xmath122 mev .",
    "a @xmath123 resonance decaying into @xmath118 and @xmath124 was earlier reported by anisovich et al .",

    "none of these obtain significant contributions ( @xmath132 ) to the intensity .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the resonances near the boundaries of the dalitz plot , particularly @xmath51 and @xmath55 , suffer from the effect of the anticuts. no convergence was obtained when the reported hybrids @xmath128 and @xmath129 were included in the fits .        c.  amsler , rev .",
