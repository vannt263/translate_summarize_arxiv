    "the study of weingarten s surface @xmath11 into the euclidean space @xmath12 remount to classical works development around the middle of nineteenth century by weingarten contained in the papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "essentially these surfaces are a natural generalization of one with constant curvature , more precisely , they satisfy a relation @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 stand for the principal curvatures of the surface while @xmath16 is a smooth function defined over the euclidean space @xmath17 , distinguishing when @xmath18 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote , respectively , the mean and the gaussian curvatures of @xmath19 .",
    "we point out that replacing the euclidean space @xmath12 either by the euclidean sphere @xmath0 or by the hyperbolic space @xmath20 we have the same definition . in the later case",
    "the work due to bryant @xcite when @xmath21 for a constant @xmath5 , retake this subject after a long delay , as well as works due to rosenberg and sa earp @xcite .",
    "when the ambient space is the euclidean sphere @xmath0 the case of rotational surfaces was described by dajczer and do carmo @xcite only for constant mean curvature . in recent works almeida et al .",
    "@xcite and li et al .",
    "@xcite obtained some results for weingarten surfaces of the euclidean three sphere .",
    "for the special case @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is an affine function , lopez @xcite described such surfaces into the euclidean space @xmath24 with an additional requirement on the discriminant of @xmath25 our purpose here is to extend this later description for a class of rotational surfaces into the euclidean sphere @xmath26 indeed , we shall give a special attention for such surfaces satisfying @xmath22 , where the function satisfies @xmath27being @xmath28 .",
    "let us call such class of surfaces as rotational linear weingarten surfaces or shortly by rlws .",
    "we can assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , we choose @xmath30 and @xmath31 , since the cases @xmath32 and @xmath33 were analyzed by palmas in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one fundamental ingredient to understand the behavior of a rlws as well as its qualitative properties is the sign of the its discriminant which is defined according to @xmath34 . in the quoted paper lpez @xcite described rlws of hyperbolic type @xmath35 in the euclidean space @xmath24 under a suitable assumption .",
    "following dajczer and do carmo @xcite we shall use the terminology of rotational surface into @xmath0 as a surface invariant by the orthogonal group @xmath36 consider as a subgroup of the isometries group of @xmath0 .",
    "hence we can consider a profile curve @xmath37 to describe the desired surface .",
    "initially let us parametrize the profile curve @xmath37 in @xmath38 by @xmath39 , with @xmath40 if we choose @xmath41 as an element in @xmath36 the rotational surface generated by @xmath37 is parametrized as follows @xmath42 @xmath43    moreover , we can choose the parameter @xmath44 to be the arc length of @xmath45 then using this parameter we obtain @xmath46    in order to compute the principal curvatures of a rotational surface @xmath47 we remember a fundamental lemma due to dajczer and do carmo @xcite .    [ pc ]",
    "let @xmath11 be a rotational surface of @xmath0 under the above choices .",
    "then its principal curvatures @xmath14 and @xmath15 are given by @xmath48    with this setting we present the fundamental relation which characterizes a rlws in the euclidean sphere @xmath0 : @xmath49where @xmath50 is a constant .",
    "let us denote by @xmath51 the rlws associated with the function @xmath52 , solution of the equation ( [ eq2 ] ) and the parameter @xmath53 moreover , let us consider the special value @xmath54    [ rlwsurfaces ] let @xmath51 be a rlws with @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",

    "there is only one complete immersed rlws ( clifford torus ) in @xmath0 that such @xmath61 .",
    "finally we prove the the following result .",
    "[ family ] there is a family of complete immersed rlws in @xmath0 that does not contain isoparametric surfaces .",
    "from now on we shall choose the discriminant @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "an analogous analysis can be made for the case @xmath64 .",
    "first of all we begin this section by proving a lemma that establishes the fundamental relation ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "[ eqintegral1 ] a surface @xmath65 is rlws if , and only if , the function @xmath52 satisfies the following differential equation : @xmath66where @xmath50 is a constant .    taking into account that",

    "a solution of ( [ eq2 ] ) is complete if either @xmath52 is defined for all @xmath71 or if the pair @xmath72 admits only @xmath73 as limit values .",
    "when @xmath72 has @xmath74 or @xmath75 as limit value , we deduce that the profile curve meets orthogonally the axis of rotation .",
    "therefore , complete solutions of the equation ( [ eqintegral1 ] ) give rise to a complete rlws .    in order to describe the behavior of a solution of equation ( [ eq2 ] ) we follow the techniques contained in the next paper @xcite due to palmas .",
    "initially we note that a local solution @xmath52 of the equation ( [ eq2 ] ) paired with its first derivative @xmath72 , is contained on a level curve of the function @xmath76 defined by @xmath77    where @xmath78 .",
    "[ criticalpoint ] let @xmath79 be the set of critical points of @xmath80 contained in the interior of @xmath81 .",
    "then we have :    1 .",
    "@xmath82 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath83 ,    where @xmath84 .",
    "straightforward calculations yield @xmath85    for @xmath86 we affirm that @xmath87 .",
    "otherwise from @xmath88 we have @xmath89    hence we conclude that @xmath90 . since @xmath91 and @xmath92 we arrive at a contradiction .",

    "we start analyzing the function @xmath80 on the sets @xmath108 and @xmath109 . on the former case we have @xmath110 while on the later one @xmath111 now , if @xmath103 we get @xmath112 , then @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "therefore @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 because @xmath118 is the only critical point of @xmath80 in @xmath119 .",
    "now , if @xmath106 lemma [ criticalpoint ] yields that @xmath120 is the only critical point of @xmath80 in @xmath119 .",
    "thereby , we have two possibilities to consider :    * @xmath112 . in this case , since @xmath113 , @xmath121 we get @xmath115 , @xmath122 and @xmath107 . * @xmath123 and @xmath29 .",
