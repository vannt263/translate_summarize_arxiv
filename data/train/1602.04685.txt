    "in classical electrodynamics , the dynamics of @xmath0 charges and their corresponding electromagnetic fields is governed by the lorentz equations @xmath1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the maxwell equations @xmath2 and the maxwell constraints @xmath3 for @xmath4 . in our notation ,",
    "@xmath5 denote the position and momentum of the @xmath6th charge at time @xmath7 . for simplicity",
    "we give all charges the same mass @xmath8 and rigid electric charge density @xmath9 and use units such that the speed of light equals one and the vacuum permittivity equals @xmath10 .",
    "note that by virtue of , the constraints at @xmath11 imply that they hold for all times @xmath12 .",
    "contrary to the text - book presentation , see , e.g. , @xcite , in which one employs only one total electric and magnetic field , it will be convenient for our discussion to associate with each charge @xmath6 an individual electric and magnetic field @xmath13 .",
    "thanks to the linearity of the maxwell equations in the field degrees of freedom , the equations of motion - coincide with the one given in text - books when setting @xmath14 .",
    "other choices of @xmath15 allow to switch on or off the interaction of the @xmath16-th field on the @xmath6-th charge .    for arbitrary @xmath15 and smooth and compactly supported @xmath17 it has been proven that the coupled system of equations - has a well - posed initial problem for any initial data @xmath18 with reasonably regular fields @xmath19 fulfilling the constraints ; see @xcite .",
    "spinning charges were discussed in @xcite and the semi - relativistic system was considered in @xcite . very early , however , it was observed , e.g. , in @xcite , that replacing the charge density @xmath20 by a dirac delta distribution @xmath21 ( for simplicity , setting the total electric charge equal one ) renders the self - interaction summand @xmath22 on the right - hand side of the lorentz equation , and thereby , also the coupled system of equations - , ill - defined .",
    "the reason for this is that , in the point - charge case @xmath23 , the maxwell fields @xmath24 are not entirely smooth anymore but have a second order pole at @xmath25 which is exactly where they would have to be evaluated in @xmath22 . in order to distinguish the case of general @xmath20 from the point - charge case of @xmath23",
    ", we use the convention that lower - case fields @xmath26 solve the equations - for @xmath23 , which then implies the relation @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the convolution and @xmath29 is a solution to the free maxwell equations , i.e. - for @xmath30 . to see the divergent behavior of @xmath26 ,",
    "thanks to the linearity , it suffices to regard a special solution to - for a fixed charge trajectory @xmath31 . in the following we drop the index @xmath6 to keep the notation slim .",
    "two well - known solutions of - are the advanced and retarded linard - wiechert fields @xmath32=({\\boldsymbol{e}}^\\pm_t,{\\boldsymbol{b}}^\\pm_t)$ ] , where the square bracket notation emphasizes the functional dependence on the charge trajectory @xmath33 .",
    "they are given by @xmath34}{|{\\boldsymbol{x } }      -{\\boldsymbol{q}}|(1\\pm { { \\boldsymbol{n}}}\\cdot{\\boldsymbol{v}})^3}\\bigg|^\\pm ,      \\nonumber      \\\\       { \\boldsymbol{b}}^{\\pm}_t({\\boldsymbol{x } } )      & : =      \\mp { \\boldsymbol{n}}^{\\pm}\\wedge{\\boldsymbol{e}}^{\\pm}_t({\\boldsymbol{x } } ) ,      \\label{eq : lw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the abbreviations @xmath35 cf .",
    "all other solutions @xmath36 to - for the same trajectory @xmath33 can then be represented as @xmath37+(1-\\lambda){\\boldsymbol{f}}^+_t[{\\boldsymbol{q}},{\\boldsymbol{p}}]+{\\boldsymbol{f}}^0_t\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath38 $ ] , where @xmath39 is a solution to the corresponding homogeneous equations , i.e. , - for @xmath40 . for smooth @xmath39 , the explicit expressions in imply that all corresponding fields @xmath36 are smooth on @xmath41 where they admit the discussed singular behavior that renders the term @xmath22 in ill - defined for @xmath23 .    to still make sense out of this ill - defined self - interaction , an informal mass renormalization argument",
    "is usually employed , see @xcite , which effectively replaces the problematic term @xmath22 with the finite abraham - lorentz - dirac back reaction @xmath42 . in the non - relativistic regime , the latter",
    "may be approximated by @xmath43 , with @xmath44 denoting the electric charge .",
    "this procedure cures the original problem , however , introduces a dynamical instability as for almost all but very special initial accelerations , which now must be provided along with initial positions and momenta , the corresponding charge trajectories approach the speed of light exponentially fast .",
    "nevertheless , it was shown that the subset of physically sensible solutions can be well approximated in certain regimes by a dynamically stable version that was suggested by landau and lifschitz ; see @xcite .",
    "after replacing the ill - defined term @xmath22 appropriately or simply omitting it by setting @xmath45 , which often can be justified as its renormalized version is usually small ( e.g. , for small acceleration , jerk , and electric charge ) , one might hope that there are no further obstacles in arriving at a solution theory for the maxwell - lorentz system - in the point - charge limit @xmath46 . a general proof of the well - posedness of the corresponding initial value problem",
    ", however , is difficult and remains open .",
    "the first two difficulties are obvious : 1 ) the charges must not collide , otherwise @xmath47 in blows up ; and 2 ) the charges must not approach the speed of light too fast , otherwise the factors @xmath48 in may blow up .",
    "mathematically , difficulty 1 ) poses a similarly delicate problem as in the @xmath0-particle problem of gravitation , only now with the additional complication that the coulomb potentials in are lorentz - boosted and to be evaluated at _ delayed _ or _ advanced _ times @xmath49 as given in .",
    "difficulty 2 ) is due to the accumulation of the escaping fields along the light cone and must be excluded with an a priori bound on the charge velocities .",
    "when handled with care , it is reasonable to expect that at most only very few initial values @xmath50 lead to catastrophic events due to these two difficulties .",
    "however , there is a third difficulty which is more subtle and , to our knowledge , has not received attention yet .",
    "given a charge trajectory @xmath51 , only rather special initial fields @xmath52 give rise to solutions @xmath26 to - that are sufficiently regular outside a neighborhood of @xmath25 in order to be evaluated in the terms @xmath53 in for all times .",
    "generic initial fields will generate singular fronts in the fields traveling at the speed of light , and another charge @xmath16 having velocities below the speed of light is bound to traverse such fronts in finite time . + in section  [ sec : steps ] we explain the mathematical origin of this questionable artifact and discuss how solutions with singular light fronts can be ruled out by appropriate restrictions on the initial values . in section  [ sec : ml - system ] , for the point - charge case @xmath23 , we give necessary conditions for global existence of piecewise as well as globally smooth solutions to the maxwell - lorentz system - .",
    "we discuss that this point - charge phenomenon has a straight - forward analogue in quantum field theory , and furthermore , implications on the case of extended charges @xmath20 . in the latter ,",
    "the singular light fronts qualitatively persist in @xmath24 , however , in a smoothened version as can be seen from the convolution relation @xmath27 . due to this additional smoothness ,",
    "the singular light fronts cause no trouble concerning the solution theory anymore .",
    "nevertheless , as illustrated in a quantitative example in the end of section  [ sec : admissible ] , they can cause sharp , though smooth , steps on the length scale of the diameter of @xmath20 , and therefore , in principal observable radiation . moreover , in section  [ sec : admissible ] , we demonstrate that the initial value problem is ill - posed when demanding smooth global solutions , as the necessary restriction on the initial fields @xmath52 requires information about the , at @xmath11 , unknown charge trajectories @xmath54 .",
    "we introduce a mathematical procedure for finding admissible initial fields despite this fact .",
    "the latter , however , introduces an unwanted arbitrariness which , as we suggest in section  [ sec : conclusion ] , can be eliminated by physical reasoning .",
    "the resulting restrictions on the initial values naturally turn the equations of motion of the maxwell - lorentz system - into a class of delay differential equations that include the fokker - schwarzschild - tetrode equations of motion of wheeler - feynman electrodynamics @xcite and the synge equations @xcite as prime examples .",
    "let us assume for a moment that , at least for a neighborhood around @xmath11 , the maxwell - lorentz system - has as a solution with actual charge trajectories @xmath54 and fields @xmath55 for @xmath4 .",
    "the goal in this section is to introduce explicit formulas for those fields @xmath56 , depending on their corresponding trajectory @xmath54 and initial field @xmath19 , in order to infer the properties of general solutions to - .",
    "since we can always retrieve from the point - particle fields @xmath26 the ones of the extended charges by convolution , @xmath57 , we will consider the point - particle case @xmath58 only .",
    "furthermore , we drop the index @xmath6 in this entire section because all the computations hold for any given charge @xmath6 . an explicit expression for @xmath36 solving - for trajectory @xmath33 and initial field @xmath59",
    "can be found by recasting the maxwell equations in an integral form that reads @xmath60 again , the convolution is denoted by @xmath28 , and furthermore , @xmath61 is the propagator of the wave equation given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 are the advanced and retarded green s functions of the dalembert operator .",
    "see appendix  [ sec : appendix ] for details on the derivation of from kirchhoff s formulas .",
    "note that by virtue of the maxwell equations , the maxwell constraint is preserved over time , which then also holds in this integral form .    before we begin with an investigation of the properties of the general maxwell field , it is illustrative to look at a simple example that shows how singular light fronts arise .",
    "considering the maxwell constraint , one might think that an obvious candidate for a good initial field @xmath59 is given by the coulomb field @xmath64 plugging the explicit form of the initial field into and the actual trajectory @xmath33 into allows to compute .",

    "furthermore , @xmath69 denotes the sign of @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath70 stands for @xmath71 if @xmath72 and for @xmath73 if @xmath74 , and @xmath75 denotes the characteristic function being one for @xmath76 in the closed ball @xmath77 of radius @xmath78 around @xmath79 and zero for @xmath76 in the open set @xmath80 . for the details regarding the computation we refer the reader to the appendix  [ sec : appendix ] .",
    "the result shows that , according to , inside the light cone of space - time point @xmath81 the new advanced / retarded linard - wiechert field generated by the charge trajectory @xmath33 builds up as expected while , according to , in this region the initial coulomb field @xmath59 given in is displaced .",
    "the field @xmath59 then persists only outside of that light cone .",
    "in addition , one finds two distributions in that depend on the newtonian initial data @xmath82 only and have support exclusively on the light cone .",
    "see figure  [ fig : coulomb ] for an illustration .",
    "this figure illustrates the supports of the terms in - making up the solution @xmath36 to the maxwell equations - for an initial coulomb field @xmath59 given in and some fixed charge trajectory @xmath33 . inside the light cone of @xmath83 ( blue area ) the initial field @xmath59",

    "( white area ) the initial coulomb field persists . the distribution valued terms are located only on the light cone . ]    by inspecting - more closely one thus finds that in general the maxwell field @xmath36 is not smooth on @xmath85 although the initial field @xmath59 in is . on the contrary , for most charge trajectories @xmath33 the field will express singular fronts on the light cone of @xmath86 because : 1 ) the distributions @xmath87 $ ] and @xmath88 $ ] in cancel only if @xmath89 ; and 2 ) the remaining terms and only connect continuously on this light cone if at least the acceleration @xmath90 vanishes . otherwise , the field @xmath36 will have a discontinuity there .    at first sight",
    "this phenomenon may seem surprising .",
    "however , it has a rather simple explanation .",
    "morally , the initial coulomb field @xmath59 in corresponds to the field generated by a charge at rest at position @xmath79 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath59 is the retarded linard - wiechert field generated by an auxiliary charge trajectory @xmath91 fulfilling @xmath92 and @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "if the actual charge trajectory @xmath33 does not connect smoothly to @xmath91 at @xmath11 but admits a kink , this sudden change of acceleration will result in a radiation field traveling along the light cone of @xmath86 . should @xmath95 be non - zero , an infinite acceleration is necessary to change the momentum from @xmath96 to @xmath95 , and the corresponding radiation gives rise to the distributions , whereas a step in the acceleration merely causes a discontinuity on the light cone .",
    "this simple example demonstrates that in order to prevent singular light fronts , a compatibility condition between the initial field @xmath59 and the actual trajectory @xmath33 has to be met .    in the rest of this section , the objective is to identify a necessary compatibility condition for the general case .",
    "according to the general splitting in , also any relevant initial field @xmath59 , obeying the maxwell constraint , can be written in the form @xmath97 +      ( 1-\\lambda ) { \\boldsymbol{f}}_{0}^+[\\tilde{{\\boldsymbol{q } } } , \\tilde{{\\boldsymbol{p } } } ] + { \\boldsymbol{f}}_{0}^{0},\\ ] ] for some @xmath38 $ ] , @xmath98 $ ] being the linard - wiechert fields generated by a smooth auxiliary charge trajectory @xmath91 fulfilling @xmath92 .",

    "in this chapter we discuss the implications of the observations made in section  [ sec : steps ] on the fully coupled system of maxwell s and lorentz s equations - .",
    "our main interest , which will be discussed first , lies in the case of @xmath118 point - like charges , i.e. , @xmath23 , either with a properly renormalized self - interaction term @xmath22 or without it , i.e. , @xmath45 .",
    "the implications on the maxwell - lorentz system for smooth extended charges @xmath20 are considered in the end .",

    "thus , at @xmath123 the lorentz force felt by charge 2 must evaluate the field @xmath124 at some point on the light cone of @xmath121 .",

    ". should condition ( c1 ) of section  [ sec : steps ] not be satisfied , this evaluation is ill - defined because of the presence of the distributions . in this case , the dynamics will cease to exist beyond the time instant @xmath119 .",

    "will undergo a likewise discontinuous jump .",
    "hence , should the perturbed solution exist globally it can only be piecewise smooth .",
    "furthermore , the discontinuity in the acceleration of charge 2 will give rise to a corresponding discontinuity in the field @xmath150 on the light cone of @xmath151 , which charge 1 is bound to cross eventually . by this mechanism , a whole network of singular light fronts is developed .",
    "the argument is depicted in figure  [ fig : a2 ] .",
    "+     perturbing the initial field of charge 1 , @xmath152 , by a small bump in @xmath143 at the corresponding retarded time , leads to a discontinuity of @xmath124 supported on the light cone of @xmath121 , and thus , charge 2 experiences a sudden jump in acceleration at time @xmath138 , which causes a discontinuity in @xmath150 . ]",
    "these two arguments indicate that the initial value problem of the maxwell - lorentz system - with renormalized ( or without ) self - interaction term is ill - posed for general initial values @xmath50 only fulfilling the maxwell constraints : even if a global solution is found , only a small perturbation in the initial values suffices to prevent either global existence , by ( a1 ) , or global smoothness , by ( a2 ) , of the potential solution corresponding to the perturbed initial values .",
    "one might tend to think that these are all problems connected to the point - like nature of the charges , a concept that could even be considered questionable in the classical regime .",
    "indeed , as discussed in the introduction , it is true that for the maxwell - lorentz system of smoothly extended charges those mathematical problems do not show up .",
    "nevertheless , the qualitative behavior of generation of singular light fronts for initial conditions that violate ( c1 ) or ( c2 ) remains the same .",
    "as the fields of the extended charges are of the form @xmath27 , the discussed singular fronts are now only smeared out by the charge density @xmath20 . for @xmath20 supported on the scale of the classical electron radius , i.e. , @xmath153 , the singular fronts will still result in sharp  though smooth ",
    "steps in the fields on the respective light cones .",
    "other charges are bound to eventually traverse such steps and will suddenly    on time scales of @xmath154 divided by their respective speed    start or stop to radiate , thus , leading to potentially observable though physically questionable phenomena .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to note that the singular light fronts persist also in quantum field theory .",
    "this can readily be observed in the following toy model in which a fixed source at @xmath155 interacts with a second - quantized and massless scalar field @xmath156 by means of the interaction hamiltonian @xmath157 , where @xmath158 and @xmath159 are the bosonic creation and annihilation operators fulfilling the ccr @xmath160=\\delta^3({\\boldsymbol{k}}-{\\boldsymbol{k}}')$ ] .",
    "formally , @xmath161 is not well - defined without an ultraviolet cut - off such as @xmath20 but for the sake of the argument it is sufficient to continue informally .",
    "let @xmath162 be the time evolution generated by @xmath161 , then for any initial unit fock state @xmath163 we get @xmath164 the expectation value of this scalar field can therefore be represented by means of kirchhoff s formulas as it was done for the maxwell field in appendix  [ sec : appendix ] . in the simplest case of an initial vacuum @xmath165 one",
    "finds @xmath166 where the discontinuity on the light front shows up again as the field is build up over time starting from an initial vacuum .",
    "this behavior only disappears for special initial @xmath163 , precisely , the ground state of this toy model , which can be computed explicitly , plus smooth additional free fields . if we further allow the charge @xmath167 to move , very similar scenarios as discussed in section  [ sec : steps ] can be constructed ; but this shall not be our focus here .    in conclusion , for any choice of @xmath20 , and be it for mathematical or physical reasons , it seems desirable to restrict the space of initial values of the maxwell - lorentz system - beyond the maxwell constraints .",
    "if for a moment we also admit piecewise smooth solutions to the maxwell - lorentz system - , a sensible restriction on the space of initial values can be taken from condition ( c1 ) .",
    "if we require the initial value @xmath50 to comprise fields @xmath52 of the form for piecewise smooth auxiliary trajectories @xmath125 fulfilling @xmath168 , condition ( c1 ) as well as the maxwell constraints are fulfilled by definition and there seems to be no further obstacle concerning mathematical well - posedness of the respective initial value problem .",
    "if , however , we demand smooth global solutions , we would also need to comply with condition ( c2 ) . in order to do",
    "so we would have to know the derivatives of the charge trajectories @xmath54 at initial time @xmath11 .",
    "but those are unknown as they already require knowledge of a local solution in a neighborhood of @xmath11 .",
    "hence , there is no possibility to restrict the space of initial fields a priori in order to ensure well - posedness .    as a workaround one may consider the following approach : given initial data @xmath50 fulfilling and ( c1 )",
    ", it is possible to compute the solution of the maxwell - lorentz equations in a sufficiently small time interval @xmath169 .",
    "this can be done as the singular fronts live only on the light cones of the initial space - time points @xmath170 so that @xmath171 only has to be chosen smaller than the smallest time @xmath119 when some charge hits a singular front .",
    "this preliminary local solution allows to compute all derivatives of the charge trajectories @xmath54 at @xmath11 , and hence , it would allow to adapt the auxiliary trajectories @xmath125 in a neighborhood of @xmath11 to connect smoothly to @xmath54 such that ( c2 ) is fulfilled .",
    "this procedure changes the initial fields @xmath172 in a spatial neighborhood around the initial positions @xmath173 . if self - interaction is excluded , the adapted initial values @xmath174 , however , fulfill the maxwell constraints , ( c1 ) , and ( c2 ) , and therefore , should not bare any further obstacles concerning smooth global solutions .",
    "if self - interaction is included , the above procedure would have to be iterated until a fixed - point is found as the change in @xmath175 implies again a change in the initial acceleration of charge @xmath6 .",
    "+ though mathematically sound , physically , this is a rather opaque procedure .",
    "it is not anymore a formulation of classical electrodynamics in terms of an initial value problem for - but in terms of an initial guess , that , first , has to be adapted in a quite arbitrary way before a global solution can be inferred at all .",
    "+ so what is overlooked when naively regarding the maxwell - lorentz system - as an initial value problem ?",
    "any inhomogeneous solution @xmath26 to the maxwell equations - is of the form , which implies that the entire history of the charge trajectory @xmath54 is already encoded in the spatial dependence of the field @xmath26 ; recall the @xmath49 dependence in .",
    "now , if we set some initial field @xmath52 by hand , for which the maxwell constraint only requires that we choose it of the form with some auxiliary trajectory @xmath125 fulfilling @xmath176 , the maxwell time evolution is fooled to believe that the history of the charge trajectory is given by @xmath125 . but",
    "except for @xmath176 , the history of the auxiliary trajectory @xmath125 may have nothing in common with the actual one @xmath177 , which is to be computed . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the maxwell equations propagate such an initial field @xmath52 as if it was generated by the auxiliary charge trajectory @xmath125 outside the light cone of @xmath170 while , inside , a new field is generated according to the actual trajectory @xmath54 .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the incompatibilities between the actual charge trajectories @xmath54 and the initial fields @xmath52 of the solution - discussed in section  [ sec : steps ] occur during the dynamics and that any mismatch between the actual and auxiliary charge trajectories in the sense of ( c1 ) and ( c2 ) expresses itself as a singular light front .    in view of this , it would be desirable to find a formulation of classical electrodynamics that automatically avoids any such incompatibilities .",
    "this is possible and in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we discuss a whole class of such formulations having two representatives that are well - known since the beginning of classical electrodynamics . but",
    "first , we end this section with a short example that illustrates quantitatively 1 ) that the phenomenon of singular light fronts can lead to significant radiation effects and 2 ) how the initial fields encode the histories of their respective charge trajectories : + _ quantitative example : _ we reconsider the introductory example from section  [ sec : steps ] of a charge , referred to as charge 1 , having an initial position and momentum @xmath178 and an initial coulomb field @xmath179 , i.e. , lorentz - boosted w.r.t .",
    "whatever its future trajectory @xmath122 may be , its field @xmath124 will be of the form - as depicted in figure  [ fig : coulomb ] . in the following",
    "we will use si units and charges smeared out by @xmath20 instead of point - charges , hence we regard @xmath181 . let us suppose that the other initial fields @xmath182 of all @xmath183 other charges do not comprise free fields , i.e. , @xmath184 , and are such that charge 1 experiences a large initial acceleration , say , @xmath185 .",
    "charge 2 is assumed to have initial position and momentum @xmath186 at a sufficiently large distance , say , @xmath187 , so that , initially , it moves almost freely with velocity , say , @xmath188 .",
    "eventually , it will reach the vicinity of the light cone of @xmath189 smeared out by @xmath20 .",
    "now , if charge 1 and 2 are made out of clouds of , say , @xmath190 electrons produced by electron guns and collimated to balls of @xmath191 , the acceleration of charge 2 is @xmath192 where @xmath119 is the time of arrival inside the smeared out light cone and @xmath193 is the @xmath194-component of the electric field @xmath195 computed with the help of and : @xmath196 note that , since for simplicity we assumed that the initial coulomb field @xmath179 was already properly lorentz - boosted , the distributions cancel in contrast to the introductory example in section  [ sec : steps ] . in other words , ( c1 ) is fulfilled which makes the only contribution to the field . as a result of this analysis , we find that within the time of traversal of the smeared out light cone , @xmath197 , there must be a sudden rise in emission of radiation of charge 2 .",
    "according to lamor s formula , the resulting increase in power goes from almost zero to @xmath198    one may now wonder , why the flank in radiation power increase is so steep .",
    "as we discussed , the initial lorentz - boosted coulomb field of charge 1 encodes the history of a charge with constant momentum @xmath199 .",
    "this tells the maxwell dynamics that there must be a sudden change in acceleration at time @xmath11 from zero to @xmath200 in order to fit the initial data , and therefore , that a step in increase of radiation power ( smeared out by @xmath20 ) must be produced . in a more realistic scenario , however , charge 1 would first have to acquire the initial acceleration @xmath200 in the past @xmath74 ; to match the above numbers , for instance , by entering a capacitor and falling through a voltage of @xmath201 over a distance of @xmath202 .",
    "depending on the duration of the acceleration process which may take considerably longer than @xmath203 , a quite different initial field @xmath204 is produced .",
    "this time , it consists of the former lorentz - boosted coulomb field plus a radiation part that was emitted during the process of acceleration .",
    "in contrast to the above scenario , this additional radiation will hit charge 2 much earlier before entering the light cone region , and instead of generating a steep flank in radiation power of charge 2 from zero to @xmath205 there will be a respectively smoother increase .    in other words , and independently of the fictitious numbers we have used above , this example shows that if the choice of initial values to the maxwell - lorentz system - imply a large initial acceleration for charge 1 , which may later on enforce charge 2 to generate significant radiation , the cause that led to this large initial acceleration lies in the history of charge 1 which is encoded in the initial field @xmath204 .",
    "hence , an unnatural choice for @xmath204 such as the lorentz - boosted coulomb field above , which would imply that charge 1 did not accelerate for @xmath74 but then suddenly does at @xmath11 , leads to the peculiar effect of the steep flank in radiation power increase of charge 2 .",
    "modelling more accurately how charge 1 acquired the initial acceleration in the past will eliminate this effect .",
    "this demonstrates the intimate connection between the history of a charge trajectory and its generated field , which is the starting point of our discussion of the formulation of classical electrodynamics in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "as demonstrated , in the case of point - charges , the restriction of the solution space of the maxwell - lorentz system - to smooth solutions does not allow a formulation in terms of an initial value problem . though a potential global solution is uniquely identified by its initial data @xmath50 , only very special initial fields fulfilling the necessary condition ( c2 ) lead to smooth global solutions .",
    "furthermore , the information needed to restrict the initial data according to ( c2 ) would already require knowledge of the unknown solution . even for smooth charge distributions @xmath20 , neglect in matching the initial fields @xmath52 to the history of the charge trajectories yields rather arbitrary differences in the predictions as the example in the preceding section illustrates .",
    "these circumstances suggest that we might need to change the way we look at the solution theory for the maxwell - lorentz system .",
    "the starting point for such a consideration is the fact that the maxwell field at one time instant and the entire trajectory of the charge that generated it are intimately intertwined beyond the maxwell constraint .",
    "this can be observed best when imagining a single charge @xmath6 incoming from the remote past @xmath206 . considering , e.g. , the case @xmath104 , any auxiliary trajectory @xmath125 in the expression of the field @xmath26 in - is forgotten during a time evolution from @xmath206 to any finite time @xmath12 and so are any potential singular fronts as they escape to spatial infinity with the speed of light .",
    "concerning point - wise evaluation in any finite region of space - time , the maxwell field in - reduces to the expression @xmath207 + { \\boldsymbol{f}}^0_{i , t}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] nothing changes in this argument and in the form of when the charge trajectory @xmath54 is not prescribed but also develops simultaneously to the evolution of the maxwell fields , i.e. , according to the fully coupled system - .",
    "hence , stopping the dynamics at time @xmath11 and starting it again in an initial value problem fashion dictates the natural choice for the initial field at @xmath11 .",
    "this means that the initial field @xmath52 should be of the form for a auxiliary trajectory @xmath125 that coincides with the actual one @xmath54 and that the free field @xmath127 , as it evolves independently of the charges , equals the incoming free field evolved from @xmath206 to @xmath11 .    hence , in the general case for any @xmath38 $ ] , where also advanced linard - wiechert fields may occur , one would expect the maxwell field to take the form @xmath208+(1-\\lambda){\\boldsymbol{f}}_{i , t}^+[{\\boldsymbol{q}}_i,{\\boldsymbol{p}}_i ] + { \\boldsymbol{f}}^0_{i , t}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] any compatibility condition , such as the maxwell constraint , ( c1 ) , and ( c2 ) , is now naturally fulfilled for all times @xmath12 . but",
    "this comes at a high price . by ,",
    "the fields @xmath52 at time @xmath11 depend on the entire history of the charge trajectories which consequently means letting go of the initial value formulation of classical electrodynamics .    in view of the above",
    ", however , such a step seems well grounded . in section  [ sec : ml - system ] , it was already indicated when insisting on the merely mathematical property of smoothness of solutions .",
    "but there , one might even have been tempted to accept potential kinks in the charge trajectories , say , as long as they decay fast enough .",
    "however , the discussion above and in section  [ sec : admissible ] shows that there is also a physical reason why the initial value formulation is questionable , namely the fact that at each time instant the entire history of a charge trajectory is already encoded in the spatial dependence of its field .",
    "therefore , when entertaining the thought that charges are incoming from the remote past , the form of the maxwell fields is already presupposed by and the space of potential solutions @xmath126 of the maxwell - lorentz system - should consequently be restricted to solutions having maxwell fields @xmath26 that fulfill .",
    "such a restriction is easily implemented in the fundamental equations of motion - .",
    "it simply means replacing the maxwell fields on the right - hand side of with the explicit form given in .",
    "this makes the maxwell equations and constraints - redundant and turns the coupled system of the odes and pdes - , only consisting of terms that are all evaluated at the same time instant @xmath12 , into the following system of odes that involve terms depending on advanced or delayed times @xmath49 as given in : @xmath209 ,      \\nonumber      \\\\      { \\boldsymbol{f}}_{i , t}&=({\\boldsymbol{e}}_{i , t},{\\boldsymbol{b}}_{i , t } )      \\nonumber      \\\\      & = \\rho*\\big(\\lambda{\\boldsymbol{f}}_{i , t}^-[{\\boldsymbol{q}}_i,{\\boldsymbol{p}}_i]+(1-\\lambda){\\boldsymbol{f}}_{i , t}^+[{\\boldsymbol{q}}_i,{\\boldsymbol{p}}_i]\\big ) + { \\boldsymbol{f}}^0_{i , t}.      \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath210 denotes any given solution of the free maxwell equations .",
    "it is interesting to note that by virtue of - the free fields @xmath29 , when prescribed in the remote past , are forgotten should they have some spatial decay at spatial infinity @xcite . in this case , for @xmath211 , no self - interaction @xmath45 or @xmath212 , and for point charges @xmath23 , the system of equations is equivalent to the fokker - schwarzschild - tetrode equations @xcite as used in wheeler s and feynman s investigation of classical radiation reaction @xcite .",
    "they can be derived from a simple action principle @xcite , and furthermore , allow a derivation of dirac s radiation damping term @xmath213 without the need of a mass renormalization procedure @xcite . moreover , for @xmath104 , point charges @xmath23 , and no initial free fields , the resulting equations are equivalent to the synge equations @xcite .    the nature of these equations , involving a priori unbounded state - dependent delays @xmath49 , cf .",
    ", in the definition of the linard - wiechert fields , renders a general classification of solutions very difficult . in mathematics ,",
    "this problem is known as the _ electrodynamic n - body problem_. to this day , global existence has only been established when considering two repelling charges and restricting the motion of the charges to a straight line @xcite . when constraining the charge trajectories at times @xmath214 , for arbitrary large but finite @xmath215 , existence of solutions on @xmath216 $ ] was shown for @xmath0 smoothly extended charges in three dimensions @xcite . however , except for very special situations @xcite , almost nothing is known about uniqueness of solutions ; see @xcite .",
    "it may turn out that solutions can only be identified uniquely when whole stripes of trajectories are specified .",
    "nevertheless , such types of state - dependent delay differential equations are currently heavily under investigation in the contemporary mathematics literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) and there is good reason to expect that their solution theory will soon be better understood .",
    "in this appendix we explain how the solution formula - for maxwell s equations - can be derived from kirchhoff s formulas .",
    "afterwards we demonstrate the main steps in the computation of the explicit expression - from which - and also - can be inferred .",
