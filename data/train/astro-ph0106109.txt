    "30 doradus ( ngc2070 ) is an active star forming region in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "its most striking feature in the optical is the young and compact star cluster r136 ( hd38268 ; see walborn 1973 ) .",
    "the cluster was long thought to be a single star with a mass exceeding 3000  ( cassinelli et al . 1981 ) .",
    "the discovery that this `` single star '' fitted a king ( 1966 ) model indicated that the object is in fact a cluster of stars ( weigelt & baier 1985 ) .",
    "later the _ hubble space telescope _ provided direct proof for this hypothesis by resolving the cluster into individual stars ( campbell et al .",
    "1992 ; massey & hunter 1998 ) .",
    "the structural parameters of r136  mass ( 21000  79000 ) , half - mass radius ( @xmath7pc ) , and density profile ( @xmath8 , see e.g. campbell et al .",
    "1992 ; brandl et al .",
    "1996 ; and massey & hunter 1998 )  are quite similar to three well known counterparts in the milky way galaxy : the arches cluster ( object 17 , nagata et al .",
    "1995 ) , the quintuplet ( afgl2004 , nagata et al .  1990",
    "; okuda et al .",
    "1990 ) , and ngc3603 ( brandl 1999 ) .",
    "all being younger than @xmath9myr , these clusters are also comparable in age .",
    "ngc3603 is hidden behind a spiral arm , but is much easier to observe than the arches and the quintuplet , which are located near galactic coordinates @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( @xmath12pc in projection ) of the galactic center .",
    "the extinction in the direction of the galactic center easily exceeds 20 magnitudes in visual .",
    "r136 is conveniently located in the lmc and therefore is quite unique as it is neither obscured by dust and gas nor perturbed by external tidal fields ; the tidal effect of the lmc is negligible ( see portegies zwart et al .",
    "the large distance of about 50 kpc , however , limits the observability of the cluster .",
    "note that the star clusters westerlund 1 and 2 ( westerlund 1960 , 1961 ) both have rather similar characteristics as the above mentioned clusters .    in 1991 ,",
    "wang & helfand studied the 30 doradus region with the _ einstein _ imaging proportional counter .",
    "they found that hot gas surrounds a @xmath13pc area around r136 .",
    "they also found two marginally significant point sources with the _ einstein _ high resolution imager in the central area of 30 doradus .",
    "a follow - up with the _ rosat _ high resolution imager confirmed the presence of two point sources .",
    "wang ( 1995 ) analyzed these two sources and used their similarities with cyg x-1 , lmc x-1 and lmc x-3 to conclude that the observed x - ray sources in 30 doradus also host black holes .",
    "recent xmm observations by dennerl et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed a wealth of x - ray sources in the 30 doradus region .",
    "they pay little attention , however , to the x - ray point sources in r136 . in a preliminary study of _ chandra _ data of r136 , feigelson ( 2000 ,",
    "see also townsley et al 2001 , in preparation ) mentions the presence of a dozen bright x - ray sources with o3 or wn star companions .",
    "he argues that the dimmer sources could be colliding wind binaries , but that the brighter sources are probably x - ray binaries with neutron star or black hole primaries . from a practical point of view , however , there are some difficulties associated with claims that there are neutron stars or black holes in r136 .",
    "the most massive stars in r136 exceed 120 .",
    "massey & hunter ( 1998 ) took high resolution spectra of the brightest 65 stars and concluded that their age is @xmath142myr , where the intermediate mass stars are slightly older 45myr ( sirianni et al .",
    "they also argue that the high abundance of stars with spectral type o3 and earlier is a consequence of the young age of the cluster .",
    "de koter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) analyzed the spectra of the most massive stars in r136 and concluded that the ages of these stars are @xmath15myr , which is consistent with the results by massey & hunter ( 1998 ) .",
    "the hydrogen and helium burning age of a 120  star depends quite sensitively on its metalicity @xmath16 , being as low as 2.87myr for a @xmath17 ( the solar metalicity @xmath18 ) to 4.96myr for @xmath19 ( meynet et al .",
    "because r136 is only @xmath20myr old , no star in it can have left the main sequence yet",
    ". it would therefore be quite remarkable if the star cluster were able to produce black holes before 2myr .",
    "we analyze archival _ chandra _ data of the central portion of the 30 doradus region and confirm the detection of the two x - ray point sources previously found by wang & helfand ( 1991 ) . in addition",
    ", we find 18 new x - ray sources , of which 13 have wn wolf - rayet stars or early type o3f@xmath21 stars as optical counterparts .",
    "one of these x - ray sources is probably a blend of several wn stars in the sub - cluster r140 ( to the north of r136 ) .",
    "we argue that the x - rays produced by these systems originate from the colliding winds of the early type stars .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of three of these stars are an order of magnitude higher than the x - ray luminosities of colliding wind systems in the milky way galaxy .    in sect.[sect :",
    "obs ] we describe the _ chandra _ data and analysis , followed by a description of our findings in sect.[sect : results ] .",
    "we discuss our results in sect.[sect : disc ] .",
    "the 30  doradus region was observed with _",
    "chandra _ for 21  ksec on 2000  sep  13 with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer - imager ( acis - i ) , a @xmath22 array of four front - side illuminated ccds ( garmire , nousek , & bautz in preparation ) .",
    "the r136 star cluster was at the telescope s aim point .",
    "the data were taken in timed - exposure ( te ) mode using the standard integration time of 3.2  sec per frame and telemetered to the ground in very faint ( vf ) mode .",
    "see the _ chandra _ proposers observatory guide for details ( _ chandra _ website http://asc.harvard.edu/ ) .",
    "we followed the data preparation threads provided by the _",
    "chandra _ team and given on their website .",
    "we used the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software package to perform the reductions , with the most up - to - date ( as of june 2001 ) calibration files ( gain maps , quantum efficiency , quantum efficiency uniformity , effective area ) available for this observation .",
    "bad pixels were excluded .",
    "intervals of bad aspect and intervals of background flaring were searched for , but none were found .    to detect sources , we first filtered the unprocessed data to exclude software - flagged cosmic ray events and then processed the data without including the pixel randomization that is added during standard processing .",
    "this custom processing slightly improves the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "we then used the ciao tool _ wavdetect _",
    ", a wavelet based source detection program .",
    "we found 30 point sources and two extended sources ( snr 0538 - 69.1 and an unidentified one ) in the entire acis - i field .",

    "the positions listed in tab .  [ tab : obs ] are the _ wavdetect _ centroid positions based on the _ chandra _ astrometric solution .",
    "the uncertainties range from @xmath2601 for the brighter sources to @xmath27  for the dimmer sources .",
    "to perform source identifications , we used parker s catalog of bright stars in the 30  doradus region ( parker 1993 ) .",
    "these positions are accurate within 04 .",
    "registration of the _ chandra _ frame of reference with the parker frame was accomplished via a uniform shift calculated from a least - squares best fit to the offsets from nearby optical sources of eight x - ray sources ( cx2 , cx4 , cx5 , cx6 , cx7 , cx8 , cx12 and cx19 ) , six in the central region and two outside the central region . in a similar manner ,",
    "the parker frame was registered with the _ hubble _ frame by a uniform shift based on five stars ( names from parker 1993 : 1120 , 1134 , 922 , 786 , 767 ) in the central region .",

    "we have analyzed archival _",
    "chandra _ data of the central portion of the 30doradus region including the star clusters r136 and r140 .",
    "we confirm the detection of two bright x - ray sources with the stars mk34 and r140a as optical counterparts ( see wang & helfand 1991 ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of these two sources have not noticeably changed in the 9 years between observations .",
    "the difference in x - ray luminosity between the earlier observation and ours can be attributed to the different spectral fitting .",
    "we identified 20 point sources with an x - ray luminosity ranging from @xmath29 to @xmath30ergs@xmath2 .",
    "nine point sources are located within 14@xmath24 ( 3.4pc ) of the center of the star cluster r136 , one possibly extended source is associated with the cluster of wn stars r140 .",
    "four others have wn stars as counterparts which do not seem to be associated with either of the two clusters .",
    "wang ( 1995 ) analyzed rosat spectra of our sources cx5 ( his source number 7 ) and cx10 ( his number 5 ) .",
    "he concluded that they are probably high - mass x - ray binaries with a black hole as accreting star .",
    "his arguments are based on the spectral temperature ( 0.10.2kev for his source number 5 and 0.20.4kev for number 7 ) and the high luminosity ( @xmath31ergs@xmath2 ) .",
    "in addition he uses the measured orbital period of 2.76 days and mass function of 0.12of the star r140a2 ( see moffat et al .",
    "1987 ) as an argument for the presence of a dark object .    for comparison",
    "we calculate the value of @xmath32 ( eq.[eq : lxexp ] ) for the three known black hole x - ray binaries ( see tab.[tab : knownwr ] ) and plot these in fig.[fig : flx_wr ] .",
    "their positions in fig.[fig : flx_wr ] are completely different from the x - ray sources in ngc2070 .",
    "of course , there is an interpretational difficulty here about which state of the black hole binary ( see tanaka & lewin 1995 ) should be used for a comparison . in any case",
    ", the age of the cluster would make it remarkable if any of the x - ray sources were associated with a black hole or a neutron star . on these grounds",
    "we conclude that none of the x - ray sources in ngc2070 are associated with compact objects .",
    "we conclude that all sources are consistent with colliding wind systems .",
    "x - rays are produced in the collisions between the winds in close binaries in which these stars reside .",
    "we derive an empirical relation for the x - ray luminosity for a colliding wind binary by substitution of eq.[eq : lxexp ] in eq.[eq : lxfit ] : @xmath33 \\label{eq : lx}\\ ] ] this relation has a weaker dependence on the velocity and orbital separation compared to usov s ( 1992 ) theoretical expression ( his eq .",
    "89 ) .    about @xmath34% ( 13/18 ) of the wolf - rayet stars in ngc2070 are bright in x - rays .",
    "the star cluster also contains 5 spectral type o3f@xmath21 and wn stars ( r136b , mk37wb , mk35 , mk30 and mk49 ) which do not show up in our x - ray image .",
    "using eq.[eq : lx ] one would expect x - ray fluxes at least an order of magnitude above our detection threshold of @xmath29  ergs@xmath2 ( see down pointed arrows in fig.[fig : flx_wr ] ) .",
    "the absence of x - rays for these stars can be explained by the companion mass being much smaller than that of the wn star or by the orbital separation being much larger than the adopted 100 .",
    "alternatively , these stars are single , in which case they may be much dimmer in x - rays .",
    "the star cluster ngc3603 has characteristics similar to r136 , and therefore may also host a wealth of x - ray sources . as suggested by the referee , we examined the public 50ks _ chandra _ data centered on ngc3603 , but it goes beyond the scope of this paper to fully reduce and analyze these data .",
    "the cluster shows a wealth of interesting features including diffuse x - ray emission , exceptionally bright point sources and a large number of much dimmer point sources ( moffat , corcoran , stevens , skalkowski , marchenko , mke , ptak , koribalski , mushotzky , pittard , pollock and brandner , 2002 in preparation and stevens , private communication ) .",
    "the sources in the cluster center are heavily blend and it will be a very time - consuming task to find optical counterparts .    other clusters with similar characteristics as r136 are the arches , the quintuplet cluster and westerlund 1 .",
    "these clusters also contain a wealth of bright and young early spectral types star which , when in binaries , may be bright x - ray point sources with characteristics similar to those discussed in relation to r136 .",
    "we analyzed a 21ksec archival _ chandra _ x - ray observation pointed at the central portion of the 30 doradus region in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "the image contains 18 new x - ray sources and we confirm the existence of two sources earlier discovered by wang & helfand ( 1991 ) .",
    "nine sources are within @xmath35pc of the center of the young star cluster r136 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity ( 0.2  3.5  kev ) of these sources ranges from @xmath29 ( our detection threshold ) to @xmath1 ergs@xmath2 .",
    "the two known sources have not changed noticeably in x - ray luminosity over the 9 years between the _ einstein _ and our _ chandra _ observations .",
    "we conclude that all observed sources , except for 5 unidentified sources , the iras source irs2 , and the foreground infrared source mh2 , have stars as counterparts ( 10 wn wolf - rayet , two of@xmath21 and one o3v star ) .",
    "we argue that the x - rays in these stars are produced by colliding winds .",
    "we do not agree with wang ( 1995 ) that the two earlier discovered sources ( cx5 and cx10 ) host black holes because 1 ) the stellar environment is too young to produce black holes , 2 ) the spectra and x - ray luminosities of the sources do not at all agree with other known black hole candidates , and 3 ) the sources fit well with our simple semi - analytic colliding wind model .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of the other observed sources agree well with our simple colliding wind model .",
    "the model gives the x - ray luminosity as a function of the stellar wind mass loss , its terminal velocity and the binary separation .",
    "the empirical fit , calibrated to 16 known colliding wind binaries , culminates in eq.[eq : lx ] .",
    "this empirical relation can be used to reduce the noise in the relation between the 0.2 to 3.5  kev x - ray luminosity and the bolometric luminosity of early type stars .",
    "the luminosity calculated with eq.[eq : lx ] provides a powerful diagnostic for studying colliding wind x - ray binaries .    if the x - rays are indeed the result of colliding winds in close binaries , possibly all 13 identified sources detected with _",
    "chandra _ could be close binaries . in that case",
    "we conclude that the binary fraction among early type stars in the 30doradus region is unusually high ; possibly all early type stars are binaries .    other star clusters , with age , mass and concentration similar to r136 are likely to contain a similar wealth in bright x - ray sources .",
    "in these cases , the emission may also be produced by colliding stellar winds .",
    "we then conclude that the star cluster ngc3603 may contain more than 20 x - ray sources brighter than @xmath36 ergs@xmath2 but the majority may be blended in the cluster center .",
