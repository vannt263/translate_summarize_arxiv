    "for stars more massive than the sun the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) can be approximated well by a single power - law function , @xmath6 , with the salpeter index @xmath0 , @xmath7 being the number of stars in the mass interval @xmath8 .",
    "massey and collaborators ( massey et al .",
    "1995a , 1995b ; massey & hunter 1998 ; parker et al . 2001 ; massey 2002 ) have shown that @xmath9 and the mass of the most massive star , @xmath10 , in a cluster or ob association are invariant in the metalicity range @xmath11 , with @xmath10 only depending statistically on the richness of the cluster or association .",
    "the salpeter - power law form describes the distribution of stellar masses down to approximately @xmath12 , where the imf flattens to @xmath13 ( kroupa et al .",
    "1993 ; reid et al .",
    "2002 ) , with a further flattening near the sub - stellar mass limit ( chabrier 2003 ) .",
    "stars form in clusters that contain from a dozen or so members to many millions of stars .",
    "the mass - distribution of local embedded clusters is a power - law , @xmath14 , with @xmath15 for @xmath16 ( lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "hunter et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find @xmath17 for the initial cluster mass function in the large and small magellanic clouds , and zhang & fall ( 1999 ) report @xmath18 for young star clusters with @xmath19 in the antennae galaxies .",
    "the consensus thus emerges that the cluster mass function ( cmf ) of young star clusters of all masses can be described by a single power - law form with @xmath4 , which is consistent with the star - cluster samples in six nearby spiral galaxies studied by larsen ( 2002 ) as well as the mf of young globular clusters ( richtler 2003 ) .",
    "the stellar population of a galaxy is progressively build - up over time through star - formation in clusters .",
    "low - mass clusters are much more abundant than massive clusters and contribute most of the stars but do not contain massive stars .",
    "consequently the field - star imf depends on the form of the mf of star clusters , and will be steeper ( @xmath20 ) than the stellar imf in an individual massive star cluster .",
    "the aim of this contribution is to point out this important consequence of clustered star formation on the field - star imf .",
    "section  [ sec : meth ] quantifies this effect for different cluster and stellar mfs and section  [ sec : concs ] presents the discussion and conclusions .",
    "the composite , galactic - field imf is obtained by summing up the stellar imfs contributed by all the star clusters that formed over the age of a galaxy , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the mf of embedded clusters and @xmath23 is the stellar imf in a particular cluster within which the maximal stellar mass is @xmath10 .",
    "the mass of the most massive star in an embedded cluster with stellar mass @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 with @xmath26 on combining eqs .",
    "[ eq : mm ] and  [ eq : mecl ] the function @xmath27 is quantified by weidner & kroupa ( 2003 ) who infer that there exists a fundamental upper stellar mass limit , @xmath28 , above which stars do not occur , unless @xmath29 in which case no conclusions can be drawn based on the expected number of massive stars .",
    "we thus have , for each @xmath24 , the maximal stellar mass , @xmath30 , and with this information eq .",
    "[ eq : imfsum ] can be evaluated to compute the field - star imf .",
    "[ fig : ex1 ] shows the result assuming @xmath31 for the clusters and @xmath0 for the stars in each cluster . for the lower `` stellar '' mass limit @xmath32",
    "is adopted , while the stellar imf has , in all cases the standard ( or `` universal '' ) four - part power - law form , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 ( kroupa 2001 ) . for the minimum `` cluster '' mass , @xmath36 ( a dozen stars ) , and for the maximal cluster mass , @xmath37 , are used .",
    "the power - law index , @xmath38 , of the field - star imf is calculated from @xmath39 at log@xmath40 and 1.5 .",
    "the resulting field - star imf is well approximated by @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "most massive stars have more than one companion ( zinnecker 2003 ) . it can be shown ( sagar & richtler 1991 ) that the binary - star corrected @xmath9 is larger by about  0.4 for a binary fraction of 100  per cent . if the binary - star - corrected imf in each cluster has @xmath43 then the resulting field - star imf is even steeper with @xmath44 . the steepening of the field - star imf as a function of the star - cluster mf is plotted in fig .  [ fig : avsb ] for three different values of @xmath9 .",
    "it becomes increasingly pronounced the larger @xmath9 is .",
    "below about @xmath45 , @xmath39 and @xmath46 have the same shape ( i.e. the same @xmath47 ) because the minimum `` cluster '' , @xmath48 , only contains stars with masses less than @xmath49 ( weidner & kroupa 2003 ) .",
    "field - star imfs must therefore always be steeper for @xmath50 than the stellar imf that results from a local star - formation event such as in a star cluster .",
    "this has rather important implications .",
    "for example , the number and luminosity function of white dwarfs and galactic supernova rates are determined by the field - star imf and are rarer than predicted by a stellar imf ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rat ] ) . for a realistic cluster mf with @xmath31",
    "the sn rate is 2.55 times smaller than for a stellar imf .",
    "the chemical evolution and global energy feedback into the interstellar medium of a galaxy is determined by the total number of stars born in a distribution of star clusters , and thus by @xmath39 rather than @xmath46 . because @xmath51 for @xmath52 a smaller effective yield and less feedback energy results per low - mass star .",
    "stellar mass - to - light ratia of galaxies are often calculated by assuming the underlying imf is a single salpeter power - law , @xmath53 , over the mass interval @xmath54 ( mccaugh et al .",
    "2000 ) . for a given galaxy luminosity a salpeter power - law imf overestimates the mass that has been assembled in stars by a factor of about @xmath55 .",
    "calculating @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the total mass ever to have been in field stars and @xmath58 the corresponding mass for @xmath59 , in the mass interval @xmath54 , and scaling @xmath60 and @xmath53 to have the same number of stars in the mass interval @xmath61 , it follows that @xmath62 has an approximately parabolic shape with @xmath63 , a minimum value @xmath64 at @xmath65 and @xmath66 , in fine agreement with the dynamical mass estimates of mccaugh ( 2003 ) .",
    "note that brown - dwarfs contribute less than 7% by mass to a zero - age field - star population for @xmath67 ( kroupa 2002 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath68 must vary from galaxy to galaxy , because the star - cluster mf varies in dependence of the star - formation rate ( sfr ) in the sense of a correlation between @xmath69 and sfr ( larsen 2002 ) .",
    "this is being quantified by weidner , kroupa & larsen ( in preparation ) , and implies that a complete description of the chemo - dynamical and photometric evolution of galaxies needs the three functions @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and the star - formation history .    in practice",
    "the field - star imf can not be observed directly for @xmath42 because these stars have main - sequence life - times shorter than the age of a galaxy .",
    "salpeter ( 1955 ) estimated @xmath72 from the luminosity function of nearby field stars by correcting the star - counts for stellar evolution and assuming a uniform stellar birth - rate and found @xmath73 for @xmath74 . more recently ( and with improved stellar evolution theory )",
    "scalo ( 1986 ) and reid et al . (",
    "2002 ) estimated a field - star imf for the milky way ( mw ) by first constructing the present - day mf by counting massive stars in the local volume and applying corrections for stellar evolution , the star - formation history of the mw and diffusion of stellar orbits .",
    "the resulting field - star imf can be approximated for @xmath50 with @xmath75 ( kroupa et al .",
    "1993 ) , @xmath76 . yuan ( 1992 ) constrained the field - star imf from the distribution of stellar remnants , and calculating @xmath38 from @xmath77 at log@xmath78 and 1.2 , the yuan - field - imf has @xmath79 ( yuan s fig.15c ) and @xmath80 ( yuan s fig.16c ) .",
    "these estimates are consistent with @xmath0 and @xmath31 , but they rely on assumptions concerning stellar evolution and the stellar birth - rate history of the mw .",
    "consequently the more direct measurement of @xmath9 from very young clusters ( yielding @xmath81 ) was preferred more recently to define the `` standard '' , or `` galactic - field imf '' ( kroupa 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "however , this contribution has made it apparent that @xmath82 is closer to the truth .",
    "it therefore appears that the field - star imf should show a change in index at @xmath83 from @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) to @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "massey ( 2002 ) finds that massive stars that are not in ob associations have @xmath88 .",
    "this steep imf of isolated massive stars has sometimes been taken to possibly imply a different mode of star formation in isolated molecular cloud(lets ) which may be arrived at if the isolated interstellar medium has a different equation of state ( spaans & silk 2000 ) .",
    "an alternative may be dynamical ejections of massive stars from cluster cores with high velocities ( clarke & pringle 1992 ) .",
    "higher - mass stars typically have lower ejection velocities and thus can not spread as far into the field as less massive stars .",
    "the results obtained here alleviate this problem of the isolated massive stars by allowing a steeper field - star imf ( fig .",
    "[ fig : avsb ] ) ."
