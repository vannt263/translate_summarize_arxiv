    "<S> investigations of the mass and decays of the @xmath0 hybrid are reviewed , including calculation of the @xmath1 decay widths within the qcd sum rules technique . in this calculation , the recently - proposed @xmath2 quark mixing scheme is employed . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate that the decay width @xmath3 mev is large compared with the decay width @xmath4 mev . </S>",
    "<S> inspired by these results , some phenomenological approaches are suggested to gain an understanding of the underlying mechanism of @xmath5 and @xmath6 hybrid decays .    </S>",
    "<S> the property of asymptotic freedom enables quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) to provide an excellent description of short - distance strong - interaction processes in terms of fundamental interactions between quarks and gluons , but presents significant challenges for the description of long - distance soft processes . </S>",
    "<S> quark models ( such as potential and bag models ) provide a good picture for the structure of hadrons , but the mechanism of confinement and generation of masses in such models is not fully understood . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , direct application of qcd to hadrons as bound states of quarks and gluons has not been achieved completely , and the relation between qcd and quark models is not fully elucidated . </S>",
    "<S> the study of gluon freedom may give some hints at a solution to these problems .    despite the general success of quark models for conventional @xmath7 mesons and @xmath8 baryons , some hadrons in the low and medium energy region ( 12.5 gev ) are difficult to explain as conventional hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> exotic hadrons such as glueballs ( composed purely of gluons ) , hybrids ( quark and gluonic combinations ) , and multi - quark states of more than three constituent quarks have been proposed to explain these hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> study of these exotic states can lead to a greater understanding of the non - perturbative low energy dynamics of qcd .    </S>",
    "<S> neutral @xmath7 mesons have quantum numbers of parity and charge conjugation @xmath9 given by @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; they can not have exotic quantum numbers such as @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> such exotic quantum numbers could only be achieved via exotic hadronic states .    </S>",
    "<S> the lowest - lying hybrid is predicted to be the @xmath0 state . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum and the decays of this exotic hybrid have been studied in many models . </S>",
    "<S> the mit bag model predicts a mass in the range @xmath15@xmath16 gev,@xcite and the flux tube model predicts a mass of approximately @xmath17 gev along with the decay mode predictions @xmath18_s\\approx 150 $ ] mev , @xmath19_s\\approx 40 $ ] mev , @xmath20.@xcite further flux tube model decay width predictions include @xmath21 mev , @xmath22 mev , @xmath23 mev , @xmath20.@xcite within the qcd sum rules technique , the mass predictions are in the @xmath15@xmath24 gev range , with decay mode calculations of @xmath25 mev , @xmath26 mev.@xcite finally , lattice gauge theory results in a mass prediction of about @xmath27 gev.@xcite there are some analyses with other methods , which will not be mentioned here because of space limitations .    in experiments , the most likely candidates for @xmath13 exotic hybrids , the @xmath28 and @xmath29 , have been observed by many groups . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath29 was observed by e852 and crystal barrel collaboration in the @xmath5 final states with width @xmath30 mev.@xcite the @xmath28 was observed not only in @xmath31 final states with width @xmath32 mev but also in @xmath6 final states with width @xmath33 mev by e852.@xcite if these observations truly represent an @xmath13 exotic hybrid , then the experimental signal is obviously inconsistent with theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , experimental evidence for glueball and multi - quark states candidates@xcite will open the pandora s box for the mixing among them , further complicating the analyses . </S>",
    "<S> so far , no one exotic hadron has been pinned down definitely , and clear identification and explanation of these exotic states will present experimental and theoretical challenges .    as described below , </S>",
    "<S> we have re - analyzed the channels @xmath1 using qcd sum - rule techniques which incorporate a quark - mixing scheme@xcite for @xmath2.@xcite inspired by these results , we have examined the implications of two possible assumed decay mechanisms of hybrids in the ratio of decay widths.@xcite    qcd sum rule techniques@xcite are an effective non - perturbative method which relates fundamental parameters of qcd to hadronic parameters . to calculate the channels @xmath1 , the hybrid interpolating current was chosen as @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> qcd sum - rule analysis of the three point correlator @xmath35 with the anomalous current @xmath36 results in @xmath37 and @xmath38 mev.@xcite    it is well known that the @xmath39 and @xmath40 are mixed states . in the quark mixing scheme , the orthogonal flavor basis was chosen as @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath43.@xcite    in order to take account of the @xmath44 , @xmath45 mixing in our sum rules calculation , we used @xmath46 in construction of the three point correlator @xmath47 and obtained @xmath48 mev and @xmath49 mev in a consistent fashion.@xcite we note that in this calculation , the decay width @xmath50 is much larger than that of @xmath51 .    </S>",
    "<S> can we find some hints about the mechanism of hybrid decays through the study of @xmath52 ? </S>",
    "<S> let us first consider the radiative decays of @xmath53 and @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> we have the experimental values@xcite @xmath55    as is known , the radiative decay of @xmath56 could be thought to occur through @xmath57 , resulting in@xcite @xmath58 where the @xmath59 pair is assumed sufficiently hard and the use of the local operator @xmath60 extracted from the @xmath59 pair is a good approximation .    alternatively , the radiative decay of @xmath61 could be thought to occur through @xmath62,@xcite resulting in @xmath63 in fact , these approximations involving couplings to different operators are related to the radiative @xmath56 and @xmath61 decay mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , there exist two possible decay mechanisms for hybrids . </S>",
    "<S> the physical picture is that the couplings through two different operators may correspond to two different hybrid decay mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> one corresponds to quark fragmentation into two gluons ( denoted by @xmath59 ) , and the other corresponds to gluon fragmentation into a quark and an anti - quark ( denoted by @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if these approximations are valid , then we can detect these two different decay mechanisms directly through the ratio of decay widths .    </S>",
    "<S> when the decay @xmath52 occur through @xmath64 , we have@xcite @xmath65 while a decay @xmath52 through @xmath66 results in@xcite @xmath67 from our results , the decay of @xmath52 seems to occur through @xmath7 mechanism , which means that the quark in light hybrids is not hard enough to fragment into two gluons.@xcite to verify the relation between the decay mechanism and decay widths , more decay channels should be analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the decay widths and branching ratios of hybrids should be measured . </S>"
