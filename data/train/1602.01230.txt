    "entanglement is perhaps one of the most baffling features of quantum systems .",
    "indeed , the possibility of producing entangled states was first considered as the signature of the incompleteness of quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "however , eventually entanglement was verified experimentally and recognized as a valid and fundamental feature of the quantum world . moreover , practical implications of quantum entanglement are foreseen nowadays , e.g. , in the fast developing fields of quantum information and computation  @xcite . there , in order to achieve the highest computational power , it is desirable ( at least theoretically ) to produce states with large entanglement .    for a bipartite system consisting of two subsystems of dimensions @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( with , e.g. , @xmath2 ) , several proxies were introduced to quantify the degree of entanglement , which are all functionals of @xmath0 non - negative eigenvalues @xmath16 of the reduced density matrix , satisfying the normalization constraint @xmath17 and called _ schmidt eigenvalues _ ( see section [ model ] for details ) .",
    "these functionals are , to name a few , the entanglement entropies - von neumann entropy @xmath18 or @xmath19-parametrized rnyi entropy or @xmath20 the rnyi entropy converges respectively to the von neumann entropy @xmath21 or to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the largest eigenvalue .",
    "] , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 ; the purity @xmath26 , and also its reciprocal value - the so - called schmidt number @xmath27 defined as the effective number of non - zero coefficients in the schmidt decomposition ( see below ) , i.e. , the number of effective degrees of freedom contributing to the entanglement .",
    "the schmidt number is defined on the interval @xmath7 $ ] and @xmath28 corresponds to maximal entanglement . in some instances , the schmidt number can be directly measured experimentally @xcite .    _",
    "random pure _ states , for which the schmidt eigenvalues are strongly correlated random variables , have attracted a strong interest in recent years : they are believed to constitute a promising candidate for quantum computation since their _ average _ entanglement entropy is close to the maximal possible entropy of a completely degenerate state , when all @xmath29 and hence , @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they may serve as a reference point whose entanglement content is to be compared to an arbitrary quantum state evolving in time .",
    "they also appear in the study of quantum chaotic or non - integrable systems  @xcite . finally ,",
    "as we proceed to show , the schmidt eigenvalues for random pure states have the same joint probability density function ( jpdf ) as the so - called _ scaled eigenvalues _",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the eigenvalues of wishart random matrices normalized by the trace .",
    "the latter have diverse applications both in statistics and in performance analysis of wireless communication systems , the spectrum sensing problem in cognitive radio networks being just one particular example ( for which @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the number of antennas and the number of samples per antenna , respectively ) @xcite . for other results and applications of entangled random systems ,",
    "see @xcite .    as the schmidt eigenvalues are random variables for random pure states , so are the entropies , the purity and the schmidt number .",
    "statistical properties of the entropies and of the purity , and some other related observables ( apart from the schmidt number , which did not receive much attention ) , have been rather extensively studied in recent years  @xcite , focusing either on the limiting behavior when @xmath0 and @xmath1 are small or , conversely , tend to infinity . in particular , the full distribution of the purity has been analyzed for small @xmath0 in @xcite , and for large @xmath0 its characteristic function has been determined in @xcite . for square @xmath10 systems with @xmath31 , the leading asymptotic behavior of the distributions of von neumann and rnyi entropies ( including large deviation tails ) was studied in @xcite using a coulomb gas technique .",
    "it was there realized that , quite surprisingly , even though the average entropy of the random pure state is close to its maximal value @xmath32 , the probability of this _ closeness _ may be very small .",
    "we will comment on this result further on .    for arbitrary , not necessarily large @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which is often the most relevant case in practice , the only available results so far concern the spectral ( or one - point ) densities @xcite and moments of the purity @xcite . note ,",
    "however , that the observations made in @xcite warn us that _ average _ values may not be representative of the actual behavior : to gain a better understanding of how meaningful they are , one has to go beyond the linear statistics and estimate the effective broadness of the corresponding distributions .",
    "this would require , e.g. , the knowledge of the variances of these entanglement quantifiers for any @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which is lacking at present .",
    "moreover , we stress that the von neumann entropy may not be a proper measure of the degree of entanglement as it exhibits a logarithmic growth with @xmath0 : in the limit @xmath31 , it may not be possible to distinguish whether the system attains complete or partial entanglement .",
    "the schmidt number , in particular , seems to be a better quantifier of the degree of entanglement since it grows with @xmath0 as a power law ( see below ) .    in this paper , we focus on non - linear statistics for a bipartite entanglement of random pure states .",
    "we consider first the @xmath3-point densities_n$ ] stand for the first @xmath3 components of the vector @xmath33 . ]",
    "@xmath34_n)$ ] of the schmidt eigenvalues of arbitrary oder @xmath3 .",
    "we determine such densities using three complementary approaches : the first is the generalization of the method developed previously in @xcite for calculation of the one - point densities of the schmidt eigenvalues .",
    "this allows us to show in a very compact way that the @xmath3-point densities @xmath34_n)$ ] can be expressed as a suitable laplace transform of corresponding @xmath3-point densities @xmath35_n)$ ] of the standard @xmath36-wishart - laguerre ( @xmath36-wl ) ensembles of random matrices .",
    "our second approach hinges on the ( so far seemingly unnoticed ) fact that the fixed - trace ( ft ) schmidt eigenvalues have the same jpdf as the so - called scaled variables ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which also allows for a very straightforward derivation of the general relation between @xmath34_n)$ ] and @xmath35_n)$ ] .",
    "finally , we establish a link between the cross - moments of the schmidt eigenvalues of arbitrary order and an analogous functional of the scaled variables , which allows us to relate the cross - moments of the @xmath36-ft and of the standard @xmath36-wl ensembles .    employing these tools , we present explicit expressions for the two - point densities and for the variance of the von neumann entropy .",
    "further on , we focus on the moments @xmath5 of the schmidt number @xmath6 .",
    "we derive exact results for systems with @xmath37 and @xmath38 and arbitrary @xmath1 .",
    "we show that in systems with a fixed @xmath0 and @xmath39 , the moment of order @xmath40 tends to @xmath41 , which implies that the schmidt number attains its maximal value @xmath0 : this is a signature that such systems become completely entangled in this limit .",
    "next , concentrating of square systems with @xmath10 , we spot a previously unnoticed connection between @xmath5 and the probability @xmath11 that the smallest eigenvalue @xmath12 of a @xmath13 matrix belonging to the gaussian unitary ensemble ( see , e.g. @xcite for more details ) is larger than @xmath14 .",
    "we show that @xmath42 with @xmath15 can be interpreted as the moment generating function of the purity , while @xmath42 with @xmath43 is the generating function of the moments of @xmath6 of order @xmath44 .",
    "the moments of order @xmath40 lower than @xmath45 are determined exactly as a certain integral of @xmath42 . as a byproduct of our analysis here ,",
    "we present an exact asymptotic expansion for @xmath42 with @xmath15 and arbitrary @xmath0 .",
    "finally , capitalizing on the results in @xcite for the large deviation form of @xmath42 , we establish the leading asymptotic behavior of the moments of @xmath6 in the limit @xmath31 .",
    "we show that in the square systems @xmath46 , which signifies that here @xmath6 attains only half of its maximal value and the square systems are far of being completely entangled .",
    "this may apparently explain the paradoxical behavior observed in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model ] we describe the random pure state setting and introduce some basic definitions . in sec",
    ". [ densities ] we focus on the @xmath3-point densities of the @xmath36-ft ensemble and establish a general relation with the analogous quantities of the @xmath36-wl ensembles .",
    "eventually we also derive a series of useful relations between the cross - moments of the ft and @xmath36-wl ensembles .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ spec ] we present explicit , closed - form expressions for the two - point densities and in sec .",
    "[ var ] we derive an exact expression for the variance of the von neumann entropy , valid for any @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "[ schmidt ] is devoted to the analysis of the schmidt number @xmath6 .",
    "capitalizing on the known results for the distribution function of the purity @xcite , we first present the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath6 for @xmath8 and @xmath9 and arbitrary @xmath1 , and also discuss the forms of the right and left tails of this pdf for square @xmath10 systems in the limit @xmath31 . from these results ,",
    "we derive exact expression for the moments @xmath5 of @xmath6 of arbitrary order for @xmath8 and @xmath38 and arbitrary @xmath1 , and analyze their asymptotic large-@xmath1 behavior .",
    "next , taking advantage of the established relation between the cross - moments of the ft and wl ensembles , we find an exact representation of @xmath5 of arbitrary , not necessarily integer order @xmath40 in @xmath47 systems via the probability @xmath42 that the smallest eigenvalue in the gaussian unitary ensemble is larger than @xmath48 .",
    "lastly , we discuss the asymptotic , large-@xmath0 behavior of these moments . in sec .",
    "[ conc ] we conclude with a brief summary of our results . some technical results are then confined to the appendices .",
    "a precise definition of our settings is as follows . consider a quantum state @xmath49 , which is bipartite into two smaller hilbert spaces @xmath50 and @xmath51 of dimensions @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "one example of this setting may be a spin set ( the subsystem @xmath53 ) in contact with a heat bath ( the subsystem @xmath54 ) .",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 in are assumed to be two complete bases of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the expansion of @xmath57 on the direct product of these bases involves coefficients @xmath58 , which are the ( in general complex ) entries of a rectangular @xmath59 matrix @xmath60 .    if @xmath60 is now promoted to a _ random _",
    "matrix , the class of _ random _ states @xmath57 can be further refined by requiring that    * @xmath57 must not be expressible as a direct product of two states belonging to the two subsystems @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( this condition ensures that @xmath57 is generically _ entangled _ )  , * the density matrix of the composite system is simply given by @xmath61 with the constraint @xmath62 = 1 $ ] , or equivalently , @xmath63 .",
    "this condition ensures that @xmath57 is a _ pure _ state .",
    "the density matrix @xmath64 for an entangled pure state @xmath57 of a bipartite system can be formally written as @xmath65    it is often convenient to consider the _ reduced _ density matrix @xmath66 $ ] as @xmath67 = \\sum_{j=1}^m \\br j^{b}| \\rho | j^{b}\\kt\\ , \\ ] ] whose role is to separate the contribution of the subsystem @xmath53 from the environment @xmath54 .",
    "expectation values of quantum observables involving the subsystem @xmath53 alone can often be more easily computed invoking @xmath68 .",
    "using now the expression in , one gets @xmath69 where @xmath70 are the entries of the @xmath47 covariance matrix @xmath71 , with @xmath72 denoting hermitian conjugation .",
    "similarly , one might have obtained the reduced density matrix @xmath73 $ ] of the environment in terms of the @xmath74 matrix @xmath75 .",
    "it is easy to prove that @xmath76 and @xmath77 share the same set of @xmath52 nonzero eigenvalues @xmath78 .",
    "they are all real and positive , and are called _",
    "schmidt eigenvalues_.    the _ schmidt decomposition _ ( sd ) then takes the form    @xmath79    where @xmath80 are normalized eigenvectors of @xmath81 .",
    "this implies that the original composite state @xmath57 attains the form @xmath82 implies that @xmath83 .",
    "each state @xmath84 is separable in the sd above .",
    "however , their linear combination @xmath57 can not , in general , be written as a direct product @xmath85 of two states of the respective subsystems .",
    "the state @xmath57 is therefore in general entangled , and the schmidt eigenvalues @xmath86 can be used to quantify the degree of entanglement ( see below for details ) .",
    "a sensible way to introduce randomness in this system is to sample those entangled pure states with equal probability , ( i.e. , according to the uniform measure ) over the full hilbert space .",
    "physically , this corresponds to assuming the minimal amount of _ a priori _ information about the quantum state under consideration .",
    "mathematically , this implies that the coefficients @xmath87 in are uniformly distributed on the manifold @xmath88 - this condition is necessary to enforce normalization of @xmath57 .",

    "given that there is a large parameter @xmath427 in the exponential , it is tempting to resort to the saddle - point approximation .",
    "this approach , however , yields a very poor result for the integral .",

    ". hence , we have to resort here to a different approach .",
    "lastly , we note that there is some subtlety in the behavior of the integral in ( and also in the exact expression in ) in the limit @xmath433 , since in this case @xmath434 , ( see ) .",

    "now , we turn to the evaluation of the integral in . changing the integration variable as @xmath437",
    "the expression for the moments of @xmath6 in can be conveniently cast into the form @xmath438 further on , using the well - known expression for the generating function of the hermite polynomials @xmath439 , we represent the exponential in the latter equation as a sum over hermite polynomials , @xmath440 where @xmath441 . inserting this expression into and performing the integral",

    "one infers from fig .",
    "[ cnn ] that this asymptotic form sets in starting from very moderate values of @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , we note that @xmath342 defines precisely the terms in the second line in .      next , we take advantage of the explicit representation of the hermite polynomials @xmath446 where @xmath447 is the floor function .",

    "noticing next that as @xmath31 , @xmath462 and @xmath463 we can conclude that for large @xmath0 the series in represents an expansion in the inverse powers of @xmath427 .",
    "moreover , the dominant contribution to the large-@xmath0 behavior of @xmath286 will be provided by the zeroth term , while the terms of higher order will contribute only to the subdominant behavior .",
    "more precisely , we have that the zeroth term ( @xmath448 ) of the series is explicitly given by @xmath464 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first one ( @xmath465 ) obeys @xmath466 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the second one ( @xmath467 ) ( contributing only to the order @xmath468 ) is explicitly given by @xmath469 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the terms with higher values of @xmath400 contribute to the order @xmath470 and higher , and hence can be safely neglected , given that we are interested in the large-@xmath0 behavior of the moments of @xmath6 to the order @xmath471 at most .",
    "summing the contributions given in , and , we arrive at the following result @xmath472 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we notice immediately that already the first subdominant term in this expansion is not correct , since it has a spurious quadratic dependence on @xmath40 . due to this dependence , predicts that the variance @xmath473 as @xmath31 , which is evidently incorrect .",
    "therefore , albeit may serve as useful approximation ( having the same level of accuracy as an approximate form of @xmath237 in @xcite ) , the only reliable term in it is the first leading term , ."
