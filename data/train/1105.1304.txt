    "we consider the efficient estimation of the following semiparametric additive transformation model : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a monotone transformation function , @xmath2 s are smooth regression functions ( with possibly different degrees of smoothness ) , and @xmath3 has a known distribution @xmath4 with support @xmath5 .",
    "a wide range of survival models and econometric models can be incorporated into the above general transformation framework , e.g. , @xcite . in particular , the model ( [ trans ] ) can be readily applied to a failure time @xmath6 by letting @xmath7 .",
    "we can obtain the partly linear additive cox model , i.e. , @xcite , by assuming @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is an unspecified cumulative hazard function .",
    "specifically , the hazard function of @xmath6 , given the covariates @xmath11 , has the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the baseline hazard function , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "however , if we change the form of @xmath16 to @xmath17 , the model ( [ trans ] ) just becomes the partly linear additive proportional odds model .",
    "motivated by the close connection with survival models , we focus on the current status data in this paper which arises not only in survival analysis but also in demography , epidemiology , econometrics and bioassay . more specifically , we observe @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a random examination time and @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are independent given @xmath23 . under current status data , the model ( [ trans ] ) is also related to the semiparametric binary model studied in econometrics .",
    "using the link function @xmath4 , we assume that the probability of @xmath24 , given the covariates @xmath25 , is of the expression : @xmath26 note that @xcite and @xcite have done a great deal of statistical estimation and hypothesis testing on the model ( [ link ] ) ( without @xmath27 terms ) by assuming @xmath4 to be log - log function and logistic function , respectively .",
    "an extensive discussions on the relation between ( [ link ] ) and survival models can be found in @xcite .",
    "recently a similar transformation model has been considered by @xcite but for the _ right censored data_. they showed that the monotone transformation function is root - n estimable which will never be achieved in the case of current status data .",
    "this is the key theoretical difference between the two types of survival data .    in this paper",
    ", we employ the b - spline approach to simultaneously estimate the vector @xmath28 , monotone @xmath29 and smooth @xmath30 s .",
    "the corresponding estimates are denoted as @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in contrast , @xcite apply the penalized npmle approach to ( [ trans ] ) ( with @xmath34 ) which yields a non - smooth step function @xmath35 and the penalized estimate @xmath36 .",
    "our b - spline framework has the following theoretical and computational advantages over the existing penalized npmle approach :    1 .",
    "our b - spline estimate @xmath32 is smooth and uniformly consistent .",
    "however , @xmath35 is always discontinues ( regardless of the smoothness of its true function @xmath37 ) and has a bias which does not vanish asymptotically .",
    "more importantly , the convergence rate of our @xmath32 @xmath38 is shown to be faster than that of @xmath35 @xmath39 , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , we expect more accurate inferences drawn from @xmath32 @xmath38 .",
    "we are able to give an explicit b - spline estimate for the asymptotic covariance of @xmath31 based on which the asymptotic confidence interval of @xmath28 can be easily constructed . under very weak conditions ,",
    "its consistency is proven .",
    "however , the block jackknife approach in ma & kosorok ( 2005 ) requires more computation , and is even not theoretically justified .",
    "3 .   our spline estimation algorithm requires much less computation than the isotonic type algorithm used in ma & kosorok ( 2005 ) since the order of jumps in the step function is supposed to be much larger than the order of knots we choose for estimating @xmath29 and @xmath30 s .    despite the non - root - n convergence rates of @xmath32 and @xmath33 s , we are able to show that @xmath31 is root - n consistent , asymptotically normal and semiparametric efficient",
    ". we derive the efficient information bound by taking the general two - stage projection approach from sasieni ( 1992 ) which is needed due to the involvement of multiple nonparametric functions in semiparametric models .",
    "interestingly , we observe the convergence rate interfere phenomenon for the b - spline estimators , i.e. , the convergence rates of nonparametric estimators are all slowed down to equal the slowest one . moreover , by approximating @xmath41 with the b - spline , we can avoid the monotonicity constraint in the implementation , which is usually required in the literature , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ estpro ] describes the b - spline estimation procedure .",
    "the asymptotic properties such as consistency and convergence rates of the estimates are obtained in section  [ asyrate ] .",

    "since we employ the smooth b - spline estimation rather than the penalized npml estimation , our residue error condition m4 is much less restrictive than that in @xcite , and may apply to more general class of semiparametric transformation models . note that condition m4(b ) ensures the concavity of the function @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",

    "<S> we consider the efficient estimation of the semiparametric additive transformation model with current status data . </S>",
    "<S> a wide range of survival models and econometric models can be incorporated into this general transformation framework . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the b - spline approach to simultaneously estimate the linear regression vector , the nondecreasing transformation function , and a set of nonparametric regression functions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the parametric estimate is semiparametric efficient in the presence of multiple nonparametric nuisance functions . </S>",
    "<S> an explicit consistent b - spline estimate of the asymptotic variance is also provided . </S>",
    "<S> all nonparametric estimates are smooth , and shown to be uniformly consistent and have faster than cubic rate of convergence . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we observe the convergence rate interfere phenomenon , i.e. , the convergence rates of b - spline estimators are all slowed down to equal the slowest one . </S>",
    "<S> the constrained optimization is not required in our implementation . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results are used to illustrate the finite sample performance of the proposed estimators .    _ </S>",
