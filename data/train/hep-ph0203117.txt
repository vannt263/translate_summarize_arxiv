    "predicting the pattern of fermion masses and mixings from a fundamental gauge theory is one of the major challenges in particle physics .",
    "in such an approach , the observed hierarchy of the fermion masses is usually understood in terms of some symmetry breaking interaction .",
    "in fact , due to their plausible majorana nature , the extreme smallness of the neutrino masses could be associated with a violation of the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "thus , the neutrinos can shed light on the origin of the fermion masses and mixings , since most grand unified theories ( guts ) based on so(10 ) or @xmath1 and also string theories indeed expect the @xmath0 symmetry to be broken @xcite . in building models , it is therefore particularly important to naturally reproduce the neutrino mass squared differences and the leptonic mixing parameters that have been determined by the atmospheric @xcite and solar @xcite neutrino data .    the neutrino mass squared differences are generally defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the mass of the @xmath4th neutrino mass eigenstate .",
    "we will here assume that there are three neutrino flavors , and therefore , three neutrino flavor states @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and also three neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the unitary leptonic mixing matrix is then given by @xmath9 where the unitary mixing matrix @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) rotates the left - handed charged lepton fields ( the neutrino fields ) so that the charged lepton mass matrix ( the neutrino mass matrix ) becomes diagonal .",
    "thus , the leptonic mixing matrix acquires contributions from both the charged leptons and the neutrinos .",
    "these contributions usually add in a non - trivial way ( see app .  [",
    "app : u ] ) . for three neutrino flavors , in the so - called standard parameterization , the leptonic mixing matrix reads @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( for @xmath8 ) , and @xmath15 is the physical @xmath16 phase .",
    "here @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the leptonic mixing angles .",
    "recent results suggest that among the possible solutions to the solar neutrino problem , the mikheyev  smirnov ",
    "wolfenstein ( msw ) @xcite large mixing angle ( lma ) solution is somewhat preferred to the msw small mixing angle ( sma ) solution , the msw low mass ( low ) solution , and the vacuum oscillation ( vac ) solution @xcite .",
    "actually , a global solar two flavor neutrino oscillation analysis including the latest sno data strongly favors the msw lma solution @xcite .",
    "however , the msw lma solution excludes maximal solar mixing at the 95% confidence level @xcite ( and now even at the 99.73% confidence level @xcite ) , and therefore , it also disfavors the scenario of so - called bimaximal mixing @xcite .",
    "thus , we will instead , most probably , have a _",
    "bilarge _ mixing scenario in which the solar mixing angle @xmath20 is large , but not maximal , and the atmospheric mixing angle @xmath21 is approximately maximal .",
    "it is interesting to observe that there are very strong indications that the leptonic mixing is large , whereas , on the other hand , it has turned out experimentally that the quark mixing is small @xcite .    in this paper , we will investigate a model , which yields in a technically natural way bilarge leptonic mixing , reproduces the observed mass hierarchy of charged leptons , and leads to an inverted neutrino mass hierarchy spectrum .",
    "this will be achieved by generating lepton mass matrix textures , where the mixing of the charged leptons is comparable with the mixing of the quarks and the mixing of the neutrinos is essentially bimaximal .",
    "the striking difference between the bilarge leptonic mixing and the small quark mixing will then be accounted for by the neutrinos ( mainly ) and the charged leptons ( partly ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : chargedleptons ] , we will introduce a model by adding to the standard model ( sm ) a set of extra fields and horizontal symmetries that will give rise to specific effective yukawa interactions for the charged leptons .",
    "next , minimizing the corresponding scalar potential , we will naturally obtain a mass matrix texture for the charged leptons , which is in agreement with experimental data . in sec .",
    "[ sec : neutrinomassmatrix ] , we will extend the representation content of the model in order to also obtain a realistic mass matrix texture for the neutrinos .",
    "( in app .",
    "[ app : u ] , we will explicitly calculate the leptonic mixing angles coming from the diagonalizations of the charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices , respectively . ) finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : s&c ] , we will present a summary as well as our conclusions .",
    "we will here consider an extension of the sm in which the lepton masses arise from higher - dimensional operators @xcite via the froggatt ",
    "nielsen mechanism @xcite .",
    "( for recent studies , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "we will write , in a self - explanatory notation , the lepton doublets as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , and the right - handed charged leptons as @xmath24 , where @xmath23 .",
    "suppose that the part of the scalar sector , which transforms non - trivially under the sm gauge group , consists of two higgs doublets @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath25 couples to the neutrinos and @xmath26 to the charged leptons .",
    "( for simplicity and without loss of generality , the quark sector will be left out in our entire discussion . )",
    "let us first restrict our discussion to the generation of the charged lepton masses .",
    "in order to obtain the structure of the charged lepton mass matrix from an underlying symmetry principle , we will further extend the scalar sector by sm singlet scalar fields @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) and @xmath29 and assign the fields gauged horizontal u(1 ) charges @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 as follows : @xmath33    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath33 note that our model is again kept free from chiral anomalies , since the heavy fermions are vector representations under transformations of all u(1 ) charges .",
    "the dirac neutrino fields and the scalar fields transform under the discrete symmetries @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and the additional discrete symmetry @xmath37 as    @xmath38    it is easily verified that the results for the charged lepton mass matrix remain unchanged by this new representation content . the leading order tree - level realizations of the higher - dimensional operators , which generate the neutrino masses , are shown in figs .  [",
    "fig : dimsix ] and [ fig : dimeight ] .",
    "dimsix    ( 150,20 )    dimeight1    ( 210,20 )    @xmath39 +    dimeight2    ( 210,20 )    after ssb , the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath40 will be on the approximate bimaximal mixing form @xcite @xmath41 where    [ eq : entries ] @xmath42    and the quantities @xmath43 and @xmath44 are arbitrary order unity coefficients .",
    "note that the permutation symmetry @xmath36 establishes @xmath45 , and hence , the magnitudes of the @xmath46-@xmath47- and @xmath46-@xmath48-entries in the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath40 are exactly degenerate .",
    "the possible relative phase @xmath49 between these entries can be eliminated by , _",
    "e.g. _ , the field redefinition @xmath50 , since it does not affect the mixing angles in the charged lepton sector .",
    "if we assume that all sm singlet scalar fields aquire their vevs at the breakdown scale of the additional horizontal symmetries , then eq .  ( [ eq : expansionparameter ] ) also applies to the indices @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , we can parameterize the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath40 with the same expansion parameter @xmath52 that was used for the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath53 and we find the relative suppression ratio @xmath54 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : entries ] ) .",
    "thus , diagonalizing the neutrino mass matrix @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : neutrinomassmatrix ] ) , we obtain the following spectrum of the neutrino masses @xmath55 which is on the inverted hierarchical form ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath56 ) . using",
    "the msw lma and atmospheric neutrino mass squared differences @xcite @xmath57 and a vev of the order of the electroweak scale @xmath58 , we obtain from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : entries ] ) the high mass scale @xmath59 ( as well as @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) . the entry @xmath62 of the matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : neutrinomassmatrix ] ) induces a deviation from maximal solar mixing , which is of the order @xmath63 ( @xmath64 , where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 ) .",
    "this deviation can be neglected in comparison with the contribution coming from the charged lepton sector , which is about @xmath68 ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : chargedleptonmasses ] ) , resulting in a change of the mixing angles @xmath20 and @xmath69 by approximately @xmath70 , while the atmospheric mixing angle @xmath21 practically stays maximal ( see app .  [",
    "app : u ] ) .",
    "thus , the leptonic mixing angles are @xmath71 hence , our model predicts the charged lepton mass hierarchy spectrum , an inverted neutrino mass hierarchy spectrum , bilarge leptonic mixing , as well as it reproduces the mass squared differences to lie within the ranges preferred by the msw lma solution and atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "in particular , it yields a significant deviation from maximal solar mixing .",
    "however , the solar mixing angle is bounded from below by approximately @xmath72 and it is therefore still too close to maximal to be in the 95% ( or 99.73% ) confidence level region of the msw lma solution @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have presented a model built upon extra fields , horizontal ( flavor ) symmetries , and higher - dimensional operators including the froggatt ",
    "nielsen mechanism .",
    "this model naturally yields the well - known mass matrix textures @xmath73 for the charged leptons and the neutrinos , respectively , which involve the same small expansion parameter @xmath61 .",
    "these textures reproduce the mass hierarchy among the charged leptons very accurately as well as they give rise to the most probable values of the mass squared differences for the neutrinos coming from solar and atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "in addition , assuming no @xmath16 violation , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath74 , the model gives bilarge leptonic mixing , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , which is in very good agreement with the present experimental data .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath20 is on the borderline of being compatible with the msw lma solution , which has , however , been further strengthened by recent sno results @xcite and which will , nevertheless , soon be even better tested by the kamland experiment @xcite , whereas @xmath69 is well below the chooz upper bound , and @xmath21 fits perfectly the best - fit value from the super - kamiokande collaboration of their atmospheric neutrino data .    as a final conclusion , we have shown in app .",
    "[ app : u ] that the leptonic mixing angles are all dependent on the `` solar '' mixing angle @xmath78 in the charged lepton sector in a non - trivial way .",
    "we would like to thank martin freund , patrick huber , and manfred lindner for useful discussions .",
