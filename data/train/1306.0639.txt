    "in a variational approach to gravity , we usually choose the einstein - hilbert(eh ) action as the fundamental action , which is an integral over the invariant four - volume of a scalar curvature . in order to obtain the einstein equation",
    ", one usually add a surface term@xcite .",
    "however , it was pointed out that the true dynamical degrees of freedom of gravity which make gravity intrinsically holographic reside in the surface term rather than in the bulk term @xcite , and the eh action possesses a holographic relation between the surface and bulk terms@xcite .",
    "more significantly , the einstein equation can be obtained just from the surface term of this action@xcite and it can be also obtained from the surface term of the more general actions in the case of pure gravity@xcite .",
    "therefore , the surface term is so important that we can not disregard it .",
    "a large number of cosmological observations have showed that our universe is in accelerating expansion .",
    "it is usually explained by @xmath0 model .",
    "the model is well in line with the data of astronomical observations and implies that 73% of the total energy of the universe is dark energy .",
    "however , since verlinde@xcitepointed out that gravity was explained as an entropic force caused by changes in the information associated with the positions of material bodies , it was proposed by easson et al . that a driving term should be added to the friedmann dynamic equation because of the existence of the surface term in the einstein - hilbert action@xcite . in this entropic force scenario ,",
    "called `` entropic cosmology '' , the expansion of the universe is caused by the entropy of the surface . based on the idea of entropic cosmology , the current accelerating expansion @xcite and inflation at early universe@xcite were investigated . cosmic expansion based on the entropic force scenario",
    "were also investigated in refs.@xcite .",
    "padmanabhan@xcitesuggested an idea that cosmic space is emergent as cosmic time progresses .",
    "he argued that the difference between the number of the surface degrees of freedom and that of the bulk degrees of freedom in a region of space drives the accelerating expansion of the universe through a simple equation @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the hubble volume in planck units and @xmath3 is the cosmic time in planck units .",
    "further , he derived the standard friedmann equation of frw universe .",
    "the gauss - bonnet gravity and more general lovelock gravity were also studied@xcite . and",
    "emergent perspective of gravity has been further investigated@xcite .    in this paper , we are interested in how to obtain the dynamic equation without the cosmological constant . in other words ,",
    "what may be the origin of the `` dark energy '' .",
    "the entropic force caused by the surface term can lead to a negative pressure which causes the expansion of the universe in the entropic force scenario .",
    "hence we suggest that the additional pressure is added to the matter which is taken as ideal fluid since the effects of the entropic force .",
    "furthermore , we obtain the number of modified degrees of freedom in the bulk and also get the corresponding dynamic equation in frw universe by the idea that space is emergent as cosmic time progresses .",
    "this is a dynamic equation which contains the quantum gravity effects .",
    "then we obtain the modified continuity equation . in order to more clearly see the properties of the evolution of the universe",
    ", we obtain the solutions at the early universe and the present epoch without considering the quantum effects .",
    "we can explain the current accelerating expansion without the cosmological constant .",
    "it may cause inflation at the early universe based on the quantum gravitational effects .",
    "therefore , the entropic force caused by the surface term may be explained as the `` dark energy '' . in the paper",
    "the units are chosen with @xmath4 and we take the current hubble constant @xmath5 when we calculate the age of the universe .",
    "the effective action is used as a starting point in any fundamental theories based on the viewpoint of modern physics .",
    "so does einstein gravity theory . in general ,",
    "an extra surface term is added to the eh action in order to obtain the einstein equation .",
    "but the surface term is so important that we ca nt cancel it as we point out in introduction .    in this paper",
    ", we use the eh action as our fundamental basis , this action is @xmath6 where @xmath7 . varying this action with respect to the metric",
    ", we get @xmath8 generally , the last term is described by a delta function because of the locality of the theory .",
    "however , it should be a global effect from the holographic viewpoint @xcite . in our paper ,",
    "the global effect is described by the entropic force .",
    "we consider the horizon of the universe .",
    "the horizon can be described by thermodynamics , and the thermodynamics of horizon can be described by the entropy .",
    "the corrected entropy with the quantum effects of the horizon is taken by @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the area of the horizon and @xmath11 is a parameter and @xmath12 is the planck length .",
    "the entropic force is given by @xcite @xmath13 hence , we can obtain the corresponding entropic pressure by combining eq.(3 ) with eq.(4 ) , it is @xmath14    in order to understand the emergence of space , a specific version of holographic principle was suggested by padmanabhan@xcite .",
    "he thought that our universe is being driven towards holographic equipartition(the number @xmath15 of degrees of freedom on the surface equals to the number @xmath16 of degrees of freedom in the volume ) and suggested which the law of evolution of the universe is given by @xmath17    the effective number @xmath16 of degrees of freedom in the volume is determined by the equipartition law of energy , so @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "we take the ideal fluid as the matter of the universe , @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent respectively the energy density and the pressure of the ideal fluid .",
    "further , we suggest that the additional pressure is added to the ideal fluid since the effects of the entropic force , so we can take the komar energy @xmath21 contained inside the volume @xmath22 .    by taking the hubble radius @xmath23 as the radius of the horizon and @xmath24 as the temperature of the horizon , we can obtain @xmath25 further , we can obtain @xmath26    the number of degrees of freedom on the spherical surface is given by@xcite @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the entropy of the horizon . therefore , the number of the degrees of freedom on the surface is @xmath29    if the universe is holographic , it has @xmath30 , then we can obtain @xmath31 from the above form , we can know that the energy density and the pressure respectively tend to zero when time tends to infinite , it is consistent with our physical picture .",
    "since our universe is asymptotically holographic equipartition , by using the law of evolution of the universe eq.(6 ) , we can obtain @xmath32 this equation describes globally the expansion of the universe , and it should be seen as the effective dynamic equation of frw universe which contains the effective quantum gravitational effects . in @xmath0 model ,",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath33 satisfies @xmath34@xcite , that is @xmath35 . at present , the hubble constant is @xmath36 .",
    "hence , the value of the cosmological constant is consistent with that of the dominated term @xmath37 at this epoch .",
    "the last term of eq . ( 11 ) stands for the quantum gravitational effects , it decides the cosmic dynamic evolution at very early universe .",
    "as usual , we think the continuity equation is kept , but its form is @xmath38 because of the additional pressure caused by the entropic force . substituting eq.(7 ) to the continuity equation , we have @xmath39    in this section , in order to more clearly see some properties of expansion of the universe , we consider @xmath40 , that is , we do nt consider the quantum effects .",
    "then we obtain the dynamic equation of cosmic evolution and the continuity equation @xmath41 and @xmath42 using the equation of state of the ideal fluid @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a non - negative parameter . by solving the above three equations",
    ", we can obtain the solutions @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "as we have seen , the solution does nt have the parameter @xmath44 , which implies that the rate of the expansion of the universe is same at the different epoches of the universe .",
    "we can obtain the solution of the scale factor @xmath47 it varies linearly with time .",
    "the energy density is @xmath48 , which is related with the parameter @xmath44 .",
    "the age of the universe in this case is @xmath49 the data of the supernova analyzed by the supernova cosmology project indicate that the age of universe is @xmath50@xcite .",
    "the age obtained by us is greater than that of the standard model without the cosmological constant , but it is still less than the age which is obtained by the observation .",
    "the general formula of the luminosity distance is given by @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the redshift factor defined by @xmath53 .",
    "then we can obtain @xmath54 by eq.(16 ) . substituting this result into eq.(18 ) , we can obtain the relation between luminosity distance and the redshift factor : @xmath55    for @xmath0 model , the luminosity distance of the flat universe is given by @xcite .",
    "its form is @xmath56^{-1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "it has been find that the description of the universe for @xmath59 and @xmath60 is consistent with the data obtained by wmap .",
    "model , the lower line represents the relationship under the solution @xmath45 in our model . we find that it is well in line with the result of @xmath0 model.,width=302 ]    the deceleration parameter is defined by @xmath61 substituting eq.(16 ) into eq.(21 ) , we obtain the deceleration parameter @xmath62 .      in this case",
    ", we see the solution is related with the parameter @xmath44 , it implies that the rate of the expansion of the universe is different at the different epoches of the universe .",
    "we will discuss separately the results at the early time and the late time of the universe .",
    "( i ) . at the early time of the universe",
    ", the radiation dominates the universe at high energy scales , the parameter @xmath63 .",
    "hence the evolution law of the universe is determined by @xmath45 .",
    "we can get the solution @xmath64 , thus @xmath65 and the energy density is @xmath66 .",
    "( ii ) . at the late time of the universe ,",
    "the matter dominates the universe , the parameter @xmath67 .",
    "hence the evolution law of the universe is determined by @xmath68 we can get the solution @xmath69 , so we have @xmath70 it varies with the square of time .",
    "the energy density is @xmath71 .",
    "the age of universe @xmath72 satisfies @xmath73 it is compatible with the observational result . using the eq.(18 ) , we can obtain the relation between luminosity distance and the redshift factor @xmath74     model , the lower line represents the relationship under the solution @xmath75 in our model .",
    "we find that it has some deviation from the result of @xmath0 model.,width=302 ]    by substituting eq.(22 ) into eq.(21 ) , we obtain the deceleration parameter @xmath76 .",
    "it shows that our universe is in accelerating expansion even if the quantum correction is nt considered .",
    "the result is consistent with our observations .      in this section",
    ", we analyze the solutions of the expansion of the universe without considering the quantum effects in our model .",
    "we obtain the relation between the luminosity distance and the redshift factor , and the age of the universe and the deceleration parameter . from the figures about the relationship between the luminosity distance and the redshift factor",
    ", we find that the solution @xmath45 has a better description of the astronomical observational data .",
    "but the effect of accelerating expansion seems to feeble even it may be decelerating at the late - time universe and the age of the universe is less than astro - observation under this case .",
    "on the other hand , the relationship between the luminosity distance and the redshift factor have some deviation from the results of @xmath0 model , but the effect of accelerating expansion is evident under the solution @xmath75 .    in order to obtain the correct age of the universe , the law of the evolution of the universe has to have a transformation from @xmath45 to @xmath75 at the epoch dominated by the matter .",
    "thus we find that the transformation of the law of the evolution occurs at @xmath77 if we take the age of the universe @xmath78 .",
    "that is , the universe has an evident accelerating expansion effect from then on .",
    "this is compatible with the model of `` big bang '' , which says the universe started accelerating expansion several billion years ago .",
    "if it does nt have a transformation at that time , then it is hard to explain why we have two solutions at the late time in our model and we can obtain the correct age ! is this just an algebraic accident which does nt have a physical explanation ?    as we know , it maybe cause the phase transition in the thermodynamic description .",
    "our description is based on thermodynamics , hence it maybe cause the phase transition in the evolution of the universe at the epoch dominated by the matter .",
    "does the phase transition cause that the solution @xmath45 transforms to the solution @xmath75 at some time of the epoch dominated by the matter ? if it is , what causes the phase transition ?",
    "these similar questions may be interesting , but they are beyond this paper , so we will not discuss them in this paper .",
    "however , it should be noted that we just discuss the classical evolution of the universe in the above description .",
    "that is , we do not consider the correction term in this section .",
    "if the quantum effects are considered , it may have an inflation at very early time of the universe because the quantum correction term dominates the evolution of the universe at that epoch(the letter@xcite analyzed the similar equations at the early time in the different model ) .",
    "if it is , these puzzles of the horizon and flatness can be explained as long as we choose an appropriate parameter @xmath11 .    although we do nt introduce the cosmological constant",
    ", it can also cause the current accelerating expansion of the universe which is well in line with the astro - observation .",
    "it may also cause inflation since the quantum correction term dominates the dynamic equation at very early universe .",
    "therefore , the entropic force caused by the surface term may be the origin of the `` dark energy '' . in a word , from the perspective in which space is emergent and the entropy force causes the cosmic expansion may be a good attempt to discuss the problems of cosmology .    .",
    "in this paper , our starting point is based on the eh action , it has a surface term by varying this action with respect to the metric .",
    "the surface term should cause a global effect from the holographic viewpoint @xcite .",
    "the global effect is described by the entropic force .",
    "we suggest that an additional pressure is added to the matter which is taken as ideal fluid since the effects of the entropic force in our model .",
    "thus it leads to a change of the komar energy of the matter .",
    "further , we obtain the number of modified degrees of freedom in the bulk .",
    "based on the idea that space is emergent as cosmic time progresses proposed by padmanabhan , we obtain the corresponding dynamic equation in frw universe .",
    "the dynamic equation describes globally the expansion of the universe .",
    "moreover , it contains the quantum correction term .",
    "we analyze the properties of the expansion of the universe . by using the modified continuity equation and the equation of state of the ideal fluid",
    ", we obtain these solutions of the expansion of the universe without the quantum correction . by analyzing the solution of the epoch dominated by the matter and the age of the universe",
    ", we find that it has a transformation from the solution @xmath45 to the solution @xmath75 at @xmath79 thus we have a good description about the age of the universe and the current accelerating expanding expansion effect .",
    "the curve of the relation between the luminosity distance and the redshift factor in our model has some deviation from the result of @xmath0 model at high redshift region , but it is understandable since the quantum correction term is nt considered in our above discussions .",
    "we also find that the quantum correction term plays a leading role in the evolution of the universe at very early time , it may cause inflation at that epoch . if it is , these puzzles of flatness and horizon can be solved .",
    "furthermore , we think that the entropic force caused by the surface term may be the origin of the `` dark energy '' . in the end of this paper",
    ", it should be stressed that the solutions we obtain do nt contain the quantum gravity effects .",
    "the properties of cosmic evolution with the quantum gravity effects are worthy further to investigate .",
    "our results are useful for further understanding of the `` dark energy '' and the properties of the evolution of the universe .",
