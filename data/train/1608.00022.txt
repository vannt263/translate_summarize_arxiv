    "<S> the prospects for realizing a topological quantum computer have brightened since the apparent detection of majorana fermions at the ends of semiconducting nanowires . </S>",

    "<S> recent proposals to manipulate quantum information in a majorana chain involve adiabatically adjusting gate voltages in one - dimensional nanowire networks . </S>",
    "<S> however , as we show , in the adiabatic limit , a disordered system with multiple zero - mode majorana fermions will undergo a non - local response to a local perturbation via a multi - level landau - zener transition . </S>",
    "<S> this will disperse the quantum information stored in the target zero - modes amongst other zero - modes that are present in the system , complicating the realization of controlled gates . </S>",
    "<S> there is however a solution that may work in practice : we show that there is an optimum window of intermediate time - scales during which the quantum information is approximately preserved under manipulation .    </S>",

    "<S> kitaev proposed a theoretical model in which zero - energy majorana modes occur at the ends of a one - dimensional quantum chain with superconducting coupling@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further , one can also show that majorana zero - modes would be realized at boundaries between topologically distinct phases in such chains . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments claim to have realized this model in semiconducting nanowires and detected the existence of majorana zero - modes at the edges@xcite-@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the next step towards realizing topological quantum computing is to implement braiding operations and confirm the non - abelian statistics of these quasiparticles . to this end , a protocol which uses a network of these nanowires and implements braiding by simply varying gate voltages has been proposed@xcite . in addition to the zero - modes at the edges , the protocol also utilizes majorana zero - modes in the bulk which exist at domain walls between trivial and topological zones . </S>",
    "<S> these domain walls are also created by varying a series of gate voltages over the spatial extent of the system . </S>",
    "<S> central to this technique is the assumption that keeping all operations adiabatic with respect to the superconducting gap to excited states preserves the fidelity of the quantum information .    in realistic systems , </S>",
    "<S> disorder effects need to be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> strong enough disorder gives rise to localization accompanied by a gapless spectrum . in this scenario , it is the mobility gap of localized systems which serves to protect majorana zero - modes , analogous to the role played by the superconducting gap in the clean system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the disorder exponentially localizes zero - modes with localization length controlled by the disorder strength . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of disorder also gives rise to the possibility of additional zero modes being present at random in the bulk of the system . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has recently been pointed out that adiabatic manipulations in gapless localized systems are potentially problematic , because of the problem of non - local response , whereby perturbations on a timescale @xmath2 induce a response on a length scale @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the localization length @xcite . while this result greatly constrained the possibilities for quantum control and manipulation of quantum information in e.g. quantum hall systems , it is not clear whether it applies to the majorana chain , for two reasons . </S>",

    "<S> additionally , the majorana chain is a symmetry protected topological ( spt ) phase , and such phases have also been argued to have special properties under dynamical manipulations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the question of whether a safe adiabatic limit exists for dynamical manipulations in the gapless localized phase of the majorana chain remains open .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we will show by means of simulations based on numerical exact diagonalization that the adiabatic limit is not suitable for manipulating zero modes in gapless majorana chains protected by localization . in general , a time - dependent local potential applied to this system will lead to a multi - level landau - zener transition @xcite which will decrease the fidelity of the operation . </S>",
    "<S> this work closes the twin loopholes discussed above , and establishes that the problem of non - local response to local manipulations @xcite is a general one , which applies even to spt systems without a conserved @xmath5 charge such as the majorana chain . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that there is no safe adiabatic limit for dynamic manipulations in the majorana chain . </S>",
    "<S> however , depending on the disorder realization , there may be an intermediate range of timescales over which dynamic manipulations with acceptable ( but not asymptotically good ) fidelity may be performed .    </S>",
    "<S> the system is described by a time dependent hamiltonian of the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the time independent hamiltonian of a gapless localized system and @xmath8 is a local ( in real space ) time dependent perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> it is sufficient for our purposes to consider a non - interacting localized system in one dimension with open boundary conditions . </S>",

    "<S> the non - locality of the response measured by @xmath68 in this region is high . </S>",
    "<S> this permanent reduction in the fidelity at small @xmath70 occurs due to a landau - zener transition within the quasi - zero energy subspace ( see appendix a for a plot of the energy levels ) . </S>",
