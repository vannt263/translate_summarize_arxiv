    "@xmath0 factorization theorem @xcite , as a fundamental tool of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , has been widely applied to inclusive and exclusive processes .",
    "it has been pointed out that @xmath0 factorization theorem is appropriate for processes dominated by contributions from small parton momentum factions @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "its application to exclusive @xmath6 meson decays has led to the pqcd approach @xcite , which is free of the singularities from the end - point regions of @xmath5 that usually appear in collinear factorization theorem @xcite .",
    "several aspects of @xmath0 factorization theorem have been studied . for example",
    ", a naive definition of @xmath0-dependent hadron wave functions , in which the coordinate of a quark field is simply shifted by a transverse distance , contains light - cone divergences @xcite .",
    "modified definitions to remove these divergences have been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 meson wave function defined in @xmath0 factorization theorem is normalizable @xcite , while the @xmath6 meson distribution amplitude in collinear factorization theorem is not @xcite , when evolution effects are taken into account .",
    "the sudakov resummation @xcite of the large double logarithm @xmath7 is essential for improving perturbative expansion in @xmath0 factorization theorem @xcite",
    ".    the current application of @xmath0 factorization theorem to exclusive processes is mainly made at leading order ( lo ) in the strong coupling constant @xmath8 @xcite : the important logarithms in hadron wave functions have been organized to all orders , but hard kernels are still evaluated at tree level . to demonstrate that @xmath0 factorization theorem is a systematical tool , higher - order calculations of hard kernels are demanded . in this paper",
    "we shall elucidate the framework for these calculations , deriving the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) hard kernel for the scattering process @xmath1 as an example .",
    "the point is that partons in both the quark diagrams from full qcd and the effective diagrams for the pion wave function , carrying the momentum @xmath9 , are off mass shell by @xmath2 .",
    "the difference between the two sets of diagrams defines the hard kernel in @xmath0 factorization theorem , a procedure similar to the derivation of wilson coefficients in an effective field theory .",
    "this is the way to obtain a @xmath0-dependent hard kernel without breaking gauge invariance , since the gauge dependences cancel between the above two sets of diagrams .",
    "a physical quantity is expressed as a convolution of a hard kernel with model wave functions , which are determined by methods beyond a perturbation theory , such as lattice qcd and qcd sum rules , or extracted from experimental data .",
    "a gauge - invariant hard kernel then leads to gauge - invariant predictions from @xmath0 factorization theorem .",
    "we emphasize that the above prescription for computing a @xmath0-dependent gauge - invariant hard kernel has not yet been fully recognized .",
    "several nlo calculations , which include the transverse momentum dependence via on - shell partons carrying @xmath10 , @xmath11 , have been performed in the literature @xcite . in these calculations",
    "both quark diagrams and effective diagrams are gauge - invariant , and so are hard kernels . however , the considered parton momentum is not a configuration described by the nonlocal matrix elements associated with @xmath0-dependent hadron wave functions , because the minus component @xmath12 should have been integrated out .",
    "another subtlety is that the nlo hard kernel for the process @xmath1 obtained in the above formalism turns out to be @xmath0-independent @xcite .",
    "the parton transverse degrees of freedom in the pion wave function are then integrated out , and the formalism reduces to collinear factorization theorem .",
    "moreover , we shall explain that the additional nonperturbative soft function introduced in @xcite is not necessary for @xmath0 factorization theorem , since the infrared logarithms can be absorbed into the pion wave function completely .",
    "as stated before , the light - cone singularities @xcite in the naive definition for @xmath0-dependent hadron wave functions must be regularized .",
    "these singularities , not present in the quark diagrams , are not physical .",
    "if not regularized , higher - order hard kernels , computed as the difference of the quark diagrams and the effective diagrams , will be divergent . in this paper",
    "we shall adopt the modified definition , in which the wilson lines involved in the nonlocal matrix elements for hadron wave functions are rotated away from the light cone .",
    "after the subtraction of the singularities , a hard kernel depends on regularization schemes unavoidably , which can , nevertheless , be regarded as part of the factorization - scheme dependence .",
    "this dependence , usually minimized by adhering to a fixed prescription for deriving hard kernels , does not cause a problem .",
    "the removal of the light - cone singularities from wave functions and the gauge invariance of hard kernels are the two essential ingredients for making physical predictions from @xmath0 factorization theorem .",
    "we shall demonstrate that the higher - order quark diagrams for @xmath1 generate two types of double logarithms , @xmath13 and @xmath4 , @xmath14 being the large momentum transfer squared , from the loop correction to the virtual photon vertex .",
    "the former does not appear in collinear factorization theorem , but the latter does @xcite .",
    "it is found that the effective diagrams reproduce the same double logarithm @xmath13 , which is then absorbed into the pion wave function , and organized by @xmath0 resummation @xcite .",
    "the remaining double logarithm @xmath15 can be absorbed into the jet function , and organized by the threshold resummation @xcite .",
    "eventually , the hard kernel is free of any double logarithm , and its perturbative expansion is improved .",
    "it will be shown that the nlo corrections are only few - percent for the pion transition form factor involved in the scattering process @xmath16 , if setting the factorization scale to the momentum transfer .    in sec .",
    "ii we calculate the @xmath17 quark diagrams from full qcd , the @xmath17 effective diagrams for the pion wave function , and the @xmath17 jet function , and then take their difference to obtain the @xmath17 hard kernel for @xmath1 in @xmath0 factorization theorem .",
    "the gauge invariance of the @xmath0-dependent hard kernel is proven to all orders in @xmath8 by induction in sec .",

    "<S> we calculate next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) corrections to exclusive processes in @xmath0 factorization theorem , taking @xmath1 as an example . </S>",
    "<S> partons off - shell by @xmath2 are considered in both the quark diagrams from full qcd and the effective diagrams for the pion wave function . </S>",
    "<S> the gauge dependences in the above two sets of diagrams cancel , when deriving the @xmath0-dependent hard kernel as their difference . </S>",
    "<S> the gauge invariance of the hard kernel is then proven to all orders by induction . </S>",
    "<S> the light - cone singularities in the @xmath0-dependent pion wave function are regularized by rotating the wilson lines away from the light cone . </S>",
    "<S> this regularization introduces a factorization - scheme dependence into the hard kernel , which can be minimized in the standard way . </S>",
    "<S> both the large double logarithms @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 being a parton momentum fraction , arise from the loop correction to the virtual photon vertex , the former being absorbed into the pion wave function and organized by the @xmath0 resummation , and the latter absorbed into a jet function and organized by the threshold resummation . </S>",
    "<S> the nlo corrections are found to be only few - percent for @xmath1 , if setting the factorization scale to the momentum transfer from the virtual photon . </S>"
