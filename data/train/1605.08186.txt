    "understanding leading particle production is crucial to understand forward physics at hadron colliders and also cosmic ray physics @xcite .",
    "indeed , the interpretation of cosmic ray data is strongly dependent on the accurate knowledge of the leading baryon momentum spectrum and its energy dependence ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . moreover , particle production at forward rapidities and high energies probes the qcd dynamics at very small - @xmath6 , where non - linear effects associated to high gluonic density in the target are expected to contribute significantly @xcite .",
    "this new regime of the qcd dynamics is a field of intense activity and the exclusive production of vector mesons in @xmath7 collisions and in ultraperipheral hadronic collisions is one of the most promising observables to constrain the main properties of the theory ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    leading neutron production has been investigated in @xmath8 collisions at hera , from where we have high precision experimental data on semi - inclusive @xmath9 processes @xcite as well as on exclusive @xmath3 photoproduction associated with a leading neutron ( @xmath10 ) @xcite . in these processes",
    "the incident proton is converted into a neutron via pion emission . in refs .",
    "@xcite we proposed an unified description of inclusive and exclusive processes with a leading neutron , based on the color dipole formalism , and we have demonstrated that the available experimental hera data on the @xmath11 ( feynman momentum ) distribution of leading neutrons can be very well described in this approach .",
    "an important property of our approach is that its main elements are constrained by the hera data on processes without a leading neutron . as a consequence ,",
    "our analysis of leading neutron data has put limits on the magnitude of the nonperturbative absorptive corrections and on the models of the pion flux ( which describes the pion emission by the incident proton ) .",
    "moreover , we were able to present parameter - free predictions for the inclusive and exclusive processes with a leading neutron at the energies of the future @xmath8 colliders @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in view of the construction schedule of the these new colliders , these predictions will only be tested in a distant future .",
    "given the impact of leading neutron production in forward physics , it is fundamental to consider alternative ways to learn more about this process ( see . e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we propose the study of the leading neutron production in the photon - hadron ( @xmath12 ) interactions , which are present in hadronic collisions @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will consider exclusive vector meson production associated with a leading neutron in @xmath13 interactions at @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions .",
    "recent theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that hadronic colliders can also be used to study photon - hadron and photon - photon interactions in a new kinematical range and that several open questions in the theory of strong interactions can be investigated by analysing different final states produced in these reactions ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as we will demonstrate below , such conclusion is also valid for leading neutron processes . in what follows we will investigate the exclusive @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 production associated with a leading neutron in @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions at rhic and lhc energies and present our estimates for the total cross section and rapidity distributions of these distinct final states .",
    "our goal is to demonstrate that the experimental analysis of these processes is feasible and that they may be used to study leading neutron physics as well as to study exclusive vector meson production .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the main concepts in photon - induced interactions and discuss exclusive vector meson production associated with a leading neutron . in section [ res ]",
    "we present our predictions for the rapidity distributions and total cross sections for exclusive @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 production associated with a leading neutron in @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions at rhic and lhc energies .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "in this section we will present a brief review of the formalism needed to describe the vector meson production associated with a leading neutron in photon - induced interactions at hadronic collisions .",
    "we refer the reader to our previous papers @xcite for a more detailed discussion . at high energies ,",
    "the incident charged hadrons ( proton or nuclei ) generate strong electromagnetic fields , which can be represented in terms of an equivalent photon flux . as a consequence , in a hadronic collision ,",
    "a photon stemming from the electromagnetic field of one of the two colliding hadrons can interact with one photon coming from the other hadron ( photon - photon process ) or it can interact directly with the other hadron ( photon - hadron process ) @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the latter .",
    "a basic property of these photon - induced interactions is that the cross section can be factorized in terms of the equivalent flux of photons ( from the hadron projectile ) and the photon - target cross section , with the photon flux being well known .",
    "consequently , the cross section of a photon - induced process in hadronic collisions is a direct probe of the photon - hadron cross section .",
    "therefore , the study of these processes in hadronic colliders can be considered complementary to the analysis performed at hera , as demonstrated by recent results on exclusive vector meson photoproduction in @xmath2 collisions . the main difference in comparison to hera and future @xmath8 colliders , is that photon - induced interactions are characterized by real photons , while in @xmath8 colliders it is possible to investigate vector meson production at different photon virtualities .",
    "we will extend the formalism used to treat photon - induced interactions to the description of the leading neutron processes . exclusive vector meson production associated with a leading neutron",
    "will be represented by the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ diagramas ] , which can be seen as a sequence of four factorizable subprocesses : i ) a photon is emitted by one of the incident hadrons ; ii ) this photon fluctuates into a quark - antiquark pair ( the color dipole ) , iii ) the color dipole interacts diffractively with the pion , while the proton remains intact , and iv ) the vector meson and the leading neutron are formed .",
    "the final state will be characterized by two rapidity gaps , one associated to the photon exchange and another to the colorless system exchanged between the dipole and the pion , as well as by a pion produced at large rapidities and by a leading neutron .",
    "the corresponding rapidity distribution will be given by @xmath14}{dy } = \\left[\\omega   \\frac{dn}{d\\omega}|_{h_1}\\,\\sigma_{\\gamma h_2 \\rightarrow v   \\otimes \\pi + n}\\left(\\omega \\right)\\right]_{\\omega_l } +   \\left[\\omega \\frac{dn}{d\\omega}|_{h_2}\\,\\sigma_{\\gamma h_1 \\rightarrow v   \\otimes \\pi + n } \\left(\\omega \\right)\\right]_{\\omega_r}\\ , \\label{dsigdy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 corresponds to the initial hadron ( @xmath16 or @xmath17 ) which has emitted the photon , @xmath18 is the rapidity of the vector meson @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) in the final state , which can be determined by the photon energy @xmath21 in the collider frame and by mass @xmath22 of the vector meson [ @xmath23 .",
    "the symbol @xmath24 represents a rapidity gap in the final state and @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote photons from the @xmath16 and @xmath17 hadrons , respectively . in our study",
    "we will assume that the equivalent photon spectrum @xmath27 of a relativistic proton is given by @xcite , @xmath28   \\left ( \\ln{\\omega } - \\frac{11}{6 } + \\frac{3}{\\omega }   - \\frac{3}{2 \\,\\omega^2 } + \\frac{1}{3 \\,\\omega^3 } \\right ) \\",

    "one of the main differences between the photon fluxes for the proton and for the nucleus is that the latter is enhanced by a factor @xmath37 .",
    "this implies that the rapidity distribution of the vector mesons produced in @xmath1 collisions will be asymmetric and determined by @xmath13 interactions , with the photon coming from the nucleus .",
    "in contrast , the rapidity distribution for @xmath0 collisions will be symmetric with respect to @xmath38 .    following refs .",
    "@xcite we will assume that the absorptive corrections associated to soft rescatterings @xcite can be approximated by a constant factor @xmath39 , which implies that the total cross section for the process @xmath40 can be expressed by _",

    "moreover , @xmath43 is the flux of virtual pions emitted by the proton and @xmath44 is the cross section of the interaction between the photon and the pion at center - of - mass energy @xmath45 , which is given by @xmath46 . as discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , the precise form of the pion flux is still a subject under investigation .",
    "in what follows we will assume that the pion flux is given by f_/p ( x_l , t ) = ( 1-x_l)^1 - 2 ( t ) [ f(x_l , t)]^2 [ genflux ] where @xmath47 is the @xmath48 coupling constant , @xmath49 is the pion mass and @xmath50 is the regge trajectory of the pion . in particular , we will consider that the form factor @xmath51 , which accounts for the finite size of the nucleon and of the pion , can be expressed as follows @xcite f(x_l , t ) = , ( t ) = ( t ) _ [ form3 ] where @xmath52 ( with @xmath42 in gev@xmath53 ) and @xmath54 gev@xmath55 .",

    "@xcite we will assume that @xmath71 can be expressed in terms of the dipole - proton scattering amplitude @xmath72 , usually probed in the inclusive and exclusive processes at hera , as follows @xmath73 with @xmath74 being a constant .",
