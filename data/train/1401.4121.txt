    "recent studies emphasize that the energy demand of future large scale power systems can be supplied from renewable sources @xcite .",
    "the increased integration of energy converters based on renewable sources , however , exhibits a tremendous challenge for the operation of power systems , since the production from the most extensive resources solar and wind is intermittent and therefore not flexibly dispatchable @xcite .",
    "consequently their contributions to the balancing of the power systems and to ancillary services are limited in comparison to today s power plants @xcite . for a large - scale integration of conversion technologies based on renewable sources as planned in europe until 2050 therefore alternative technologies for balancing and ancillary services",
    "need to be considered , installed , and integrated . from the current perspective",
    "the most promising options are energy storages and demand side management @xcite , since these technologies allow for a shifting of electricity provision or consumption in time and , hence , can contribute to a significant reduction in required balancing energy and power .    in the context of this contribution _ demand side management _",
    "( dsm ) is used as a proxy for technologies for the short term coordinated control and operation of loads at consumers side .",
    "prominent examples for the application of dsm in the domestic sector are e.g.  electric heating devices operated either via power line or radio communication @xcite .",
    "large - scale consumers from the industrial sector often sign individual agreements with the grid operators on their contribution to dsm . while dsm currently is mainly employed in cases of large unbalances in the grid or in order to increase the overall efficiency of unit commitment schemes @xcite , its role might change in future . for future systems based first and foremost on renewable energy sources , energy storage and dsm techniques are one option for the instantaneous adjustment of the residual load @xcite . as a component of systemic importance which e.g.  in so - called _ smart grids _ might even be controlled autonomously @xcite , a need for the quantitative characterization of the instantaneous potential for dsm arises .",
    "although dsm already today is a substantial component of procedures for the optimization of power systems @xcite both with respect to system stability and operating costs , its large - scale potential has not been characterized and investigated systematically .    in a number of recent contributions on energy system modeling",
    "general aspects of the integration of renewable sources were addressed from a conceptual perspective , with a focus on the gross interactions between energy storages , the extension of the transmission grids and strategies for the expansion of conversion capacities for renewable sources ( see e.g.@xcite ) . technically storage solutions and dsm technologies",
    "often are not differentiated in these approaches @xcite .",
    "while there from a modeling perspective indeed might be analogies between energy storage and dsm @xcite , fundamental differences are evident .",
    "in contrast to traditional storage devices with dsm rather complicated preconditions have to be considered , since the restrictions of the individual loads with respect to their time frame of management and need to be taken into account .",
    "generally this results in time dependent buffer sizes and capacities .",
    "how can these restriction be simplified , formalized and efficiently be integrated into energy system models ?    the present work aims to develop a framework for the characterization of the instantaneous potential for dsm at intermediate complexity suitable for the integration in large scale simulations .",
    "similarly to the characterization of energy storage solutions the dsm potential is determined by the properties of storage - equivalent energy buffers , but now with explicit time dependence . at this stage",
    "practical problems involving e.g.  the control of individual devices and rebound effects by intention are avoided , since these questions need to be addressed and solved independently from the general concept of dsm integration . as a consequence",
    "the resulting potential of dsm much more straightforwardly can be interpreted and integrated into conceptual simulation of future power systems than the current state of the art , which treats dsm mainly from a unit - commitment - perspective ( see e.g.@xcite ) .    for reasons of clarity , throughout the work the _ size _ of energy buffers refers to their volume in terms of energy , whereas their _ capacity _ characterizes the maximum power of production or consumption .",
    "generally two classes of dsm can be differentiated : ( 1 ) loads which can be _ shifted _ in time without a significant change in the gross energy consumption and ( 2 ) loads which can be reduced without replacement ( _ curtailment _ ) .",
    "the first class e.g.  involves a broad range of heating and cooling processes , where shifting the cycles in time only has a negligible impact on consumers . also dispatchable devices such as e.g.  domestic white goods belong to this class .",
    "dsm actions of the 2nd class such as e.g.  requests for the temporal reduction of production without replacement generally have a huger impact on the electricity consumers interests , since the overall availability of energy is directly affected . for the core part of the present paper we will restrict to dsm class 1 , where management and distribution of the energy demand is the most relevant issue .",
    "aspects for the integration of class 2 dsm in the framework are discussed briefly in the context of appendix [ sec : integration - class-2 ] . for reasons of clarity",
    "we henceforth use the time @xmath0 as a continuous variable . for correspondent expression",

    "the opposite case , i.e.  loads delayed to their latest possible moment of realization , determines a time dependent lower limit for the buffer size , @xmath16 , as defined in equation ( [ eq : e - min - ts ] ) . equations ( [ eq : p - plus ] ) and ( [ eq : p - minus ] ) specify the upper and lower envelopes for charging and discharging the respective buffers from time series of the scheduled and the maximum acceptable loads .",

    "the data and results for the analysis with the framework introduced in section [ sec : novel - fram - quant ] are exhibited in figures [ fig : example - klobasa - winter ] ( winter week ) and [ fig : example - klobasa - summer ] ( summer week ) .",
    "from inspection of the figures in particular the high potential of electric heating systems in winter for dsm actions becomes evident .    to our knowledge this time - dependent size , which is highly relevant for the characterization of the potential of dsm as energy storage - equivalent technology in energy system models , was not investigated before .",
    "as far as the capacities for charge and discharge are concerned the peak values are in line with the estimates available from other contributions ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "generally first and foremost categories @xmath19 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 seem to be appropriate for short - time management purposes , since only these categories come with significant buffer sizes and capacities . from inspection of panel ( c ) of figures [ fig : example - klobasa - winter ] and [ fig : example - klobasa - summer ] , however , in particular for categories 1 and 4 limitations in the provision of positive control power ( which is equivalent with a discharge of the buffer ) become evident , which originate from the intermittent operation of the corresponding devices .    in winter , electrical heating provides an enormous potential for dsm . with existing technologies size and capacity of the associated storage",
    "could be increased straightforwardly by either increasing the number of electrical heating devices or by increasing the size of attached heat storages .",
    "the latter would result in an increase of @xmath43 , which in particular would imply less fluctuations in the buffer size in time .",
    "if this flexibility would already be considered with scheduling the loads , increased time frames for management formally could even result in increased opportunities for the provision of positive control power .",
    "these effects would significantly ease the applicability of dsm as storage - equivalent technology .    in summer",
    "the potential for dsm is significantly lower ( see figure [ fig : example - klobasa - summer ] ) , with the highest share in category @xmath41 ( air conditioning and warm water ) . both applications , however , in principle could be attached to larger reservoirs , which significantly would increase the size of the associated energy buffer .",
    "the analyzed data set does not make use of the entire flexibility of the framework , since time - dependent maximum loads @xmath44 ( differing e.g.  between summer and winter ) are not provided for the respective categories . instead the constant values listed in table [ tab : klobasa - categories ] are used .",
    "for this reason the lower panels of figures [ fig : example - klobasa - winter ] and [ fig : example - klobasa - summer ] might overestimate the maximum charging rates e.g.  for electrical heating in summer . in this particular example",
    "the effect seems to be insignificant , since the associated energy buffer for category 1 anyway is very small during summer and the overall effect of electrical heating therefore is not relevant .",
    "generally the flexibility of considering temporal ( or seasonal ) fluctuations in the availability of devices , however , should be taken into account .",
    "we would like to draw the attention to the fact , that in figures [ fig : example - klobasa - winter ] and [ fig : example - klobasa - summer ] buffer sizes and capacities for all categories are accumulated in single plots , since they are relevant for a discussion of the potential for contributions to dsm from the individual categories .",
    "a graphical validation of realized loads as shown in figure [ fig : example-1-schematic ] is , however , not feasible in this representation , since the constraints ( [ eq : validity - r ] ) separately need to be fulfilled for each of the nine categories . for this purpose instead individual plots for the respective categories  just as shown in figure [ fig : example-1-schematic ]  would be required .",
    "in the scope of this contribution a novel , consistent framework for the characterization of dsm as storage - equivalent technology was introduced with the aim to ease the integration of dsm in energy system models and unit commitment schemes .",
    "the framework first and foremost addresses the modeling of loads , which without significant reservation can be shifted in time .. ] traditionally dsm for these application is implemented in terms of the optimization of a redistribution of individual loads . however , differing requirements for individuals loads impede a graphical illustration of the potential for dsm , its integration into large - scale system models and the optimization of complex commitment schemes .    with the novel framework developed in section [ sec : novel - fram - quant ] an intermediate degree of complexity is introduced instead : dsm is treated both with respect to energy and capacity balances . from scheduled load curves and the corresponding capacities in equations ( [ eq :",
    "e - and - p - definitions ] ) envelopes of storage - equivalent energy buffers and their respective capacities for charge and discharge are defined . at this level of abstraction the operation of individual devices and their individual time frames of management",
    "do not need to be considered .",
    "instead it is sufficient to consider conditions summarized in equations ( [ eq : validity - r ] ) in conceptual energy system models and large - scale unit commitment strategies .",
    "technical aspects concerning the small - scale dispatch of individual devices then can be addressed later independently from the desired gross effects at large - scale . for reasons of clarity and generality the equations in section [ sec : novel - fram - quant ] treat the time @xmath0 as a continuous variable .",
    "a time - discrete formulation is , however , included in appendix [ sec : time - discr - form ] .    in section [ sec : examples ] the application of the framework was discussed based on two examples .",
    "the first example , a single load pulse , is mainly interesting for conceptual reasons . on this example the graphical validation of equations ( [ eq : validity - r ] )",
    "is demonstrated . in the second example the current dsm potential in germany is investigated .",
    "the approach applies the framework developed in the scope of this work to simulation data compiled and published previously by klobasa @xcite . from the application of this framework the accumulated current potential for dsm in germany can be estimated , which is likely to increase even further with an increased dissemination of electric vehicles not considered yet . from inspection of figure [ fig : example - klobasa - winter ] in particular the transient size of the buffer associated with electrical heating systems becomes evident .",
    "the data used for analysis gives a first indication , that the storage - equivalent size of the dsm buffer for electrical heating at times can accumulate to more than @xmath45 , which is in the order of magnitude of the demand for short - term storage in fully - renewable energy systems .",
    "@xcite . scaled down to germany this would imply a demand of approximately @xmath46 . ]",
    "the transient behavior is due to the rather limited management time frame of only @xmath47 , which stems from the time when dsm was used for economic operation and commitment of huge power plants . from a technological point of view",
    "it would be straightforward to extend this time frame , e.g.  by installation of larger heat storages or by investments in the energy efficiency of facilities . from a grid perspective",
    "this might be worthwhile if dsm is operated as alternatives to energy storages and obtains systemic importance .",
    "concluding , the novel framework developed in the scope of this work is applicable for the characterization of the potential of dsm .",
    "the resulting buffer sizes and capacities significantly ease the investigation of conceptional problems in energy system modeling due to the reduced level of detail required during simulation and optimization .",
    "finally the storage - equivalent character of dsm actions becomes clear with sizes and capacities directly comparable to the storage properties of alternative technologies .",
    "in the context of this contribution the focus was on class 1 dsm , where dsm does not effect the long term energy balance .",
    "this excludes e.g.  curtailment of loads .",
    "the resulting framework , however , straightforwardly can be generalized to also include class 2 dsm actions .    in the equations introduced in section [ sec :",
    "novel - fram - quant ] , the constraint of the energy balance is reflected by equation ( [ eq : validity - r - size ] ) .",
    "formally this constraint can be relaxed for class 2 dsm .",
    "equation ( [ eq : filling - level ] ) then may diverge in the course of time , reflecting the accumulated energy surplus or deficit due to class 2 dsm actions .",
    "in section [ sec : novel - fram - quant ] for reasons of clarity the functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 were assumed to be available at arbitrary , continuous @xmath0 . in many examples of practical relevance , however , data instead is available at discrete time steps only .",
    "here we re - formulate some equations from section [ sec : novel - fram - quant ] with respect to data available at discrete time only .",
    "we therefore assume that the scheduled load is available at discrete times @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "then for each category @xmath6 scheduled loads @xmath50 with @xmath51 need to be specified , where @xmath52 is the load scheduled in the time period from @xmath53 to @xmath54 in units of mw .",
    "accordingly the load capacities @xmath55 are defined . from this discrete data , in turn time continuous functions can be defined as    @xmath56    in principle these functions now can be used with the equations developed in the cope of section [ sec : novel - fram - quant ] .",
    "in fact , the integrals defined in equations ( [ eq : e - max - ts ] ) and ( [ eq : e - min - ts ] ) , however , can be evaluated for the case of stepwise constant data . instead of these equations",
    "the envelope of the buffer size can be estimated directly from the discrete data as    @xmath57    with these expressions replacing equations ( [ eq : e - max - ts ] ) and ( [ eq : e - min - ts ] ) the evaluation of integrals is not necessary for the estimation of the envelopes for buffer sizes and capacities .",
    "the set of equations for discrete data can be extended if also the realized loads @xmath9 are discrete , which , however , in practice generally is not the case .",
