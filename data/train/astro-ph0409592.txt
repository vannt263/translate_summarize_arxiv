    "g349.7 + 0.2  is one of the three brightest radio supernova remnants ( snrs ) in our galaxy @xcite , yet until recently very little was known about it .",
    "it is a small diameter remnant ( @xmath10 ) classified as shell - type with a brighter eastern snr limb @xcite .",
    "early hi observations indicated that g349.7 + 0.2  is located at a distance of @xmath11  kpc @xcite .",
    "oh(1720  mhz )  maser emission has been detected towards g349.7 + 0.2  at a radial velocity of around + 16  kms@xmath9 , implying that the snr is interacting with dense molecular gas @xcite , and establishing a kinematic distance of 22.4  kpc .",
    "the molecular complex associated with the remnant was mapped in the co 10 line @xcite , while near - infrared and millimeter - line observations have identified the shocked portion of the cloud located towards the center of the remnant @xcite .",
    "the shocked gas has temperature around 45  k and density around @xmath12  @xmath3 , which agrees well with conditions required for oh(1720  mhz )  maser production @xcite .    in the x - ray band g349.7 + 0.2",
    "was first detected in the _ asca _ galactic plane survey @xcite .",
    "follow - up pointed observations with _",
    "asca _ showed that the remnant is one of the most luminous snrs in the x - ray band @xcite , with a thermal spectrum dominated by strong k@xmath13 lines from si , s and fe .",
    "the global spectrum was well fitted by both single equilibrium and nonequilibrium ionization models , with a plasma temperature @xmath14  kev .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "data indicated an age of @xmath15  yr , an unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of @xmath16@xmath8  ergss@xmath9 , and an energy release of @xmath17  ergs in the supernova explosion .",
    "the inferred abundances were consistent with solar values , and the large derived x - ray emitting mass ( @xmath18@xmath19 ) showed the gas to be dominated by swept - up interstellar material .",
    "these results are consistent with the snr location near a molecular cloud . however , a detailed morphological assessment and spatially resolved spectral analysis was not possible due to the poor spatial resolution of _",
    "asca_.    in this paper",
    "we present high - resolution x - ray observations of g349.7 + 0.2 with the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. we discuss the snr morphology and plasma properties , compare x - ray data with available atomic and molecular data , and compare the properties of g349.7 + 0.2   with those of similar snrs .",
    "g349.7 + 0.2  was observed with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on board the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ on 13 may 2002 ( obsid 2785 ) . the snr was positioned on the acis - s3 chip , which has the best sensitivity and energy resolution in the soft x - ray bands .",
    "data were taken in full - frame timed - exposure mode with the standard integration time of 3.2  s.    we used the contributed cxc software corr_tgain @xcite to correct for time - dependence of the acis gain @xcite . after applying the corrections ,",
    "the overall lightcurve was examined for possible contamination from a time - variable background .",
    "after these data reduction processes , the effective exposure was 56  ks from which 48606 photons were observed for the whole remnant .",
    "data were further reduced using standard threads in the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software package v.3.0.2 , and calibration database ( caldb ) v.2.26 which includes the corrected fef files for the s3 ccd used for making the acis response matrices .",
    "we used weighted response matrices for spectral fitting to account for cti effects across the ccd .",
    "the low - energy ( e @xmath20 1  kev ) quantum efficiency of the acis has been degraded by molecular contamination on the optical blocking filter , and correction for this is integrated in the v.3.0.2 .",
    "ciao tools for making auxiliary response files .",
    "in figure  [ fig - chandra ] we show the exposure - corrected 1.08.0  kev band acis image of g349.7 + 0.2 .",
    "the image has a pixel size of @xmath21 and was smoothed with a gaussian filter with a fwhm of 1 .",
    "the emission is dominated by the eastern snr shell , with the peak emission located to the southeast .",
    "the bright region appears complex with several knots of emission .",
    "the western snr shell is weak and diffuse , with no noticeable structure .",
    "as shown later , this x - ray morphology is very similar to that in the radio band .",
    "the images in different energy bands imply that the emission from the eastern - most part of the snr shell may be softer with respect to the rest of the snr .",
    "five unresolved sources have been detected in the field of g349.7 + 0.2using the celldetect procedure in ciao .",
    "their properties are listed in table  [ tab - psou ] , and three sources are marked with circles in figure  [ fig - chandra ] .",
    "source ps4 ( cxou j171801.0372617 ) is the only source located , in projection , within the snr shell .",
    "all the sources have about the same number of counts , except for source ps1 .",
    "the positions of sources were compared with the us naval observatory guide star catalogue and the 2mass all - sky point source catalogue . for sources within 2  of the telescope axis , which is true for almost all of the sources ( table  [ tab - psou ] ) the radius ( 90% confidence ) of the _ chandra _ position uncertainty is 06  ( see _",
    "chandra _ proposer s observatory guide ) .",
    "only source 1 has an optical / nir counterpart ( usno 052527848790 ) .",
    "the rest of the sources do not have counterparts within 5  of their position down to 22  mag in @xmath22 band .",
    "their spectra are hard , so they could be pulsars or background active galactic nuclei .",
    "source 4 is of particular interest since it is located within the snr and we give it more consideration in the next section .      the spatially - averaged ( global ) spectrum from the entire remnant is shown in figure  [ fig - sp - whole ] .",
    "a background spectrum was extracted from the outer regions of the s3 chip . as observed previously by _",
    "asca _ , the snr spectrum is dominated by k@xmath13 line features from si , s and fe . in addition , the _ chandra _ spectrum shows weaker lines from mg , ar and ca . for spectral",
    "fitting we used models for an optically thin thermal plasma that has reached collisional ionization equilibrium ( vraymond ; * ? ? ? * ) and for a plasma that is still being ionized ( vpshock ; * ? ? ?",
    "vpshock is a plane - parallel time - dependent ionizing plasma model for which the ionization timescale , @xmath23 , describes the progress of the plasma towards equilibrium and can assume a range of values between the specified lower ( usually set to zero ) and upper limits . since the version v.1.1 of the vpshock model we used for",
    "the spectral fitting does not include the ar line , we added a narrow gaussian component at @xmath24  kev in our fits .",
    "single - component vraymond or vpshock models with solar abundances , acceptable for analysis of the overall _ asca _ spectrum from g349.7 + 0.2 , were not able to give a satisfactory fit to the overall _ chandra _ spectrum .",
    "a good fit was obtained using a vpshock model with enhanced si abundance , and is significantly improved by adding an equilibrium thermal component with solar abundances ; the best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ tab - whole ] .",
    "this result implies that the plasma in g349.7 + 0.2  is comprised of multiple components , with a softer component having plasma temperature around 0.8  kev , and a harder component having plasma temperature around 1.4  kev .",
    "we show the contribution of both components to the global spectrum in figure  [ fig - sp - whole ] .",
    "as expected , the harder component ( dashed line ) dominates the spectrum above 3  kev , while the softer component ( dotted line ) dominates below that .",
    "we find no strong nonthermal emission in g349.7 + 0.2and estimate the power law component contribution to the observed flux from the whole snr region to be less than 2.6% for photon index values between 1.5 and 3 at the 3@xmath25 confidence level .    the si abundance in g349.7 + 0.2  is clearly enhanced ; the @xmath26 value of the vpshock+vray model drops by 46 when one additional free parameter ( the si abundance ) is added .",
    "additional elemental abundances were thawed one by one based on the inspection of the residuals , but only the additional si in the vpshock ( hard ) component improved the fit significantly .",
    "this enhanced si abundance implies that we have detected for the first time a sn ejecta component in this snr .",
    "this also implies that the soft spectral component , which has solar abundances , is most likely related to the forward shock , i.e. , shocked interstellar material .",
    "the ionization timescales obtained for the two components are consistent with this scenario .",
    "the forward shock is encountering interstellar material that is denser than that of the snr interior , and will therefore reach ionization equilibrium faster than shocked ejecta that is expanding in the rarefied snr interior .",
    "the hydrogen column density obtained from the global _ chandra _ spectrum is consistent with that obtained from the _ asca _ data @xcite .",
    "such a large column density confirms a considerable absorption of the soft emission from the snr and is consistent with its relative distance .",
    "the x - ray luminosity derived from the global snr spectrum is @xmath27@xmath8  ergss@xmath9 .",
    "we note that the value obtained for the plasma temperature from the global _ asca _ spectrum represents an intermediate value between the two temperatures detected with _",
    "chandra_.    the spectra from the whole snr",
    "can therefore be fitted with two plasma components .",
    "could these two components be separate parts of a single evolving shock ? to test this",
    "we also fitted the spectral regions with a single planar , initially unequilibrated shock ( from * ? ? ? * ) . in this model the temperatures of the electrons and protons equilibrate downstream through coulomb collisions , providing a natural range in temperatures and ionization timescales behind the shock .",
    "however , even in this model the best - fit ionization timescales of the si and s lines differ significantly such that no single component model can accurately fit both line complexes at once .",
    "the high spatial resolution of the _ chandra _ data allow us to perform a spatially resolved spectral analysis of g349.7 + 0.2  to search for spectral variations across the snr .",
    "we selected 6 extraction regions , shown in figure  [ fig - chandra ] , positioned along the snr brightness gradient and each containing around 5000 counts .",
    "spectra were re - grouped to include at least 25 counts per bin . as for the global snr spectrum ,",
    "the spectrum used for background subtraction was extracted from the outer regions of the s3 chip .    unlike the overall snr spectrum , spectra from the individual snr regions can be well fitted with single - component thermal models whose parameters vary from region to region ; the fit parameters are listed in table  [ tab - fit ] and the spectra are shown in figure  [ fig - spectra ] .",
    "all the regions , except the eastern - most region ( region 1 ) , favor the vpshock model over the vraymond model ; this implies that most of the plasma in g349.7 + 0.2  has not yet reached ionization equilibrium and is still evolving .",
    "furthermore , all the regions except the eastern - most region prefer the presence of enhanced si .",
    "similarly , only the western - most region ( region 6 ) prefers , in addition to si , an enhanced abundance of s. for completeness , in table  [ tab - fit ] we list the values of si and s abundances for all the regions .",
    "plasma temperatures , ionization timescales and column densities measured from the individual regions and the global snr spectrum are plotted in figure  [ fig - temp ] .",
    "the temperatures derived from individual regions have values intermediate to those of the soft and hard spectral components derived from the global spectrum .",
    "this suggests that the individual regions do not have sufficient statistics to distinguish between the two plasma components detected in the global snr spectrum , and represent an average of the two components summed along the line of sight .",
    "the two eastern regions , regions 1 and 2 , appear to have a lower plasma temperature than the other regions , suggesting that the softer component dominates in the eastern snr region .",
    "similarly , the fact that these two regions do not show the presence of fe - k line emission like the other regions suggests that plasma temperature in these two regions is lower than elsewhere in the remnant .",
    "figure  [ fig - temp ] also implies that there may be a small variation in ionization timescale and column density across the snr ( e.g. , regions 1 , 2 and 3 versus regions 4 and 6 ) .    to investigate the spatial distribution of si and s line emission across the remnant on a finer scale than that of the spectral extraction regions , we produced continuum - subtracted ( cs ) and equivalent - width ( ew ) images ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , shown in figure  [ fig - ew ] .",
    "narrow - band images used for deriving the cs and ew images were filtered in energy according to table  [ tab - ew ] , and binned by 8  to provide a sufficient number of counts in the faint snr regions .",
    "we found that the cs images for si and s are quite similar to the whole band image .",
    "the ew images , which represent line strength compared to the continuum , do not show any spatial variation for the si and s lines , which appears inconsistent with the results obtained from spectral modeling , at least for s. however , the ew of the emission lines does not depend just on the total number of emitting atoms that are present in the plasma , but also on the temperature and ionization state of the plasma .",
    "region 6 , where an enhanced abundance of s is derived from the spectral fit , is the same region where the ionization timescale is low , which also makes the line - to - continuum ratio lower than expected for an equilibrium plasma .",
    "the net result is that the s ew is relatively uniform across the remnant .",
    "this is confirmed by measuring ews directly from spectra of the two representative snr regions .",
    "the derived ews for the si(s ) line in regions 2 and 6 are @xmath28(@xmath29 )  kev and @xmath30(@xmath31 )  kev , respectively .      to derive mean electron density @xmath32 for the two plasma components , we approximate the x - ray emitting volume @xmath33 as a sphere 6.4  pc in radius , and denote @xmath34 and @xmath35 as filling factors for the soft and hard emission components , respectively .",
    "the emission measure for each component ( @xmath36 ) is @xmath37 . assuming that the soft and hard thermal components are roughly in pressure equilibrium ( @xmath38 )",
    ", we can derive their relative filling factors : @xmath39 .",
    "here we assume that the plasma temperature we measure represents the temperature of all species ( electrons and ions ) , although the x - ray fits only provide the electron temperature . substituting in the fitted values from table  [ tab - whole ] , we find that @xmath40 . however , in the case that the whole snr volume is not emitting x - rays , we set @xmath41 to account for the unknown volume filling factor .",
    "the electron densities are then @xmath42@xmath8@xmath43  @xmath3 and @xmath44@xmath8@xmath43  @xmath3 . the x - ray emitting mass can be found from @xmath45 , which gives @xmath46@xmath19  mass in the soft component and @xmath47@xmath19  mass in the hard component .",
    "@xcite showed that the global characteristics of a snr expanding into a density gradient will be similar to those of the sedov ( adiabatic ) snr , because there is a mutual compensation of the emission deficit from the low density regions by the enhanced emission from the high density regions .",
    "the shock temperature is thus related to the plasma temperature as in the @xcite model : @xmath48  k , for @xmath49  kev ( using the temperature of the soft spectral component which is most probably the forward shock component , as suggested previously ) .",
    "the corresponding shock velocity can be calculated from @xmath50  kms@xmath9 , where @xmath51 is the mean atomic weight .",
    "the snr age is proportional to the shock radius and velocity , @xmath52 .",
    "we adopt the snr radius of 1 , for which its dimensional size is @xmath53@xmath8pc , and derive an snr age of @xmath54@xmath8  yr .",
    "this is in agreement with the upper limits derived from the ionization timescales of the two components of @xmath55  yr .",
    "the explosion energy is approximately @xmath56@xmath8@xmath57  ergs , using the value of @xmath58 derived above .",
    "this is a slightly lower energy than the canonical value of @xmath59  ergs , although the uncertainty on the density @xmath58 could modify this estimate somewhat .",
    "the x - ray emission from the point source cxou j171801.0372617 found inside the snr shell is hard ( table  [ tab - psou ] ) , and there is a possibility that this source is a neutron star associated with the snr . indeed , in our _ asca _ study we suggested that g349.7 + 0.2  could be the remnant of a core - collapsed supernova @xcite . because the total number of counts from the point source is too low for spectral analysis , we estimated the unabsorbed flux using the count rate ( @xmath60@xmath61  counts  s@xmath9 ) , the effective area and response matrix files for acis - s .",
    "neutron stars are found with a range of photon index values , with classical young pulsars having values between 1.11.7 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and more exotic objects like compact central objects ( ccos ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) having a softer photon index of @xmath62 and a blackbody component with temperature between 0.20.4  kev @xcite .",
    "thus , assuming the same column density as for the snr ( 7@xmath5  @xmath6 ) and a power law photon index between 1.1 and 4.0 we obtained an unabsorbed integrated flux in the 0.510.0  kev range of @xmath63(0.4 - 4.1)@xmath64  ergs@xmath6s@xmath9 , which at a distance of 22  kpc gives an x - ray luminosity of @xmath65@xmath66  ergss@xmath9 .",
    "this luminosity is lower than the values found from the other young pulsars , and is closer to the luminosities found from ccos , such as the one in snr g347.30.5 @xcite .",
    "there is no obvious compact source at the location of our point source in the radio image , but some difuse emission is present at the 15  mjybeam@xmath9 level . using the number of sources as a function of flux density from the _ chandra _ multi - wavelength plane survey @xcite , we derive a chance probability of @xmath67 for finding an unrelated source with the x - ray brightness of @xmath68@xmath69  ergs@xmath6s@xmath9  ( assuming a power law photon index of 1.7 ) within the boundary of the snr .",
    "thus , the x - ray luminosity , and lack of an optical and radio counterpart at the present sensitivity of the observations is consistent with a possibility that point source in g349.7 + 0.2  is an associated cco .",
    "we also examined 21-cm hi  emission towards the g349.7 + 0.2  region from the southern galactic plane survey ( sgps ) data with angular resolution of @xmath70 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the 21  cm spectrum toward the remnant shows very strong absorption at all negative velocities ( @xmath71 ) and at positive velocities up to + 8  kms@xmath9 .",
    "this places the snr slightly beyond the solar circle on the far side . adopting the molecular cloud velocity of + 16  kms@xmath9  and using a flat rotation curve beyond the solar circle ,",
    "the kinematic distance is 23.0  kpc , as found by @xcite .",
    "the galactic center co survey of @xcite covers this region with beamwidth ( 1/8 ) sampling .",
    "integrating the nearest co spectrum over the range @xmath72 to @xmath73  kms@xmath9  and using the co - to - mass conversion factor @xmath74  @xmath6k@xmath9  kms@xmath9  @xcite we obtain : @xmath75 the 21 cm velocity - integrated intensity varies very smoothly in longitude and latitude through the position of the remnant , and to obtain the atomic column density we used the average 21 cm spectrum over a small rectangle ( @xmath76 ) surrounding the remnant , but excluding a smaller region ( @xmath77 ) of absorption directly toward the remnant",
    ". a lower limit on the atomic column density can be obtain by assuming the 21 cm emission is optically thin .",
    "this yields : @xmath78 adopting a standard hi  spin temperature of 140  k yields an atomic column density of @xmath79 therefore : @xmath80 which agrees well with the value derived from x - ray observations .",
    "the x - ray morphology of g349.7 + 0.2  revealed with the _ chandra _ observations is strikingly similar to that of the radio image @xcite , shown as contours in figure  [ fig - radio ] .",
    "previous studies in the radio band have suggested that the structure of g349.7 + 0.2  is consistent with two overlapping rings , with the fainter , larger ring corresponding to the side where the snr shock is encountering a lower - density medium @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with theoretical modeling of snr expansion in a medium with a density gradient ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since the snr shock moves slowly in the dense cloud and faster in the lower density medium , two half shells with different radii are expected to be seen , with the shell radii depending on the initial location of the explosion and the steepness of the density gradient .",
    "in addition , @xcite performed 2-d hydrodynamical modeling of the evolution and x - ray emission of snrs expanding in a large - scale density gradient , as seen by an observer under different viewing angles . compared to their model ,",
    "the morphology of g349.7 + 0.2  is broadly consistent with a large scale density gradient seen by an observer at an angle of @xmath81 .",
    "g349.7 + 0.2  shows some morphological resemblance to another galactic snr associated with oh(1720  mhz )  masers , ic 443 .",
    "the two remnants are of similar age and spatial size , and radio and x - ray morphology of ic  443 is also consistent with expansion into a large scale density gradient @xcite produced by an hi  cloud on the east and south - east side of the snr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in ic  443 ,",
    "an interaction with a co cloud is occurring in the central region , where shocked molecular gas and oh(1720  mhz )  maser emission is found ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure",
    "[ fig - mol]a we show the distribution of the molecular cloud associated with g349.7 + 0.2 , as traced by the co 10 emission @xcite , superimposed on the _ chandra _ image .",
    "the molecular cloud interaction with g349.7 + 0.2  also appears to be limited to the central part of the remnant .",
    "the location of oh(1720  mhz )  masers @xcite , also shown in figure  [ fig - mol]a , point to the on - going interaction between the co cloud and the snr .",
    "oh masers originate from shocked molecular clumps with density around @xmath12  @xmath3 and temperature of 50125  k , which have encountered the shock propagating transverse to the line of sight @xcite . shocked h@xmath82",
    "2.12  @xmath83 emission has also been detected at the locations of the oh masers @xcite .",
    "the velocity - integrated h@xmath82 10 s(1 ) emission is shown in figure  [ fig - mol]b , superimposed on the _ chandra _ image .",
    "the h@xmath82 line emission originates from the warm ( @xmath84  k ) gas just behind the part of the shock front expanding into the molecular cloud .",
    "the h@xmath82 emission is also situated in the center of the snr where x - ray emission is very faint .",
    "it is possible that due to high density in this region the snr shock became radiative and we see the transmitted shock through the molecular cloud , that radiates mostly in ir band ; mid - ir and far - ir emission has also been detected from this part of the snr @xcite .",
    "thus , the density gradient responsible for the morphology of g349.7 + 0.2  is probably produced by hi  clouds , as seen in ic  443 .",
    "velocity - integrated ( + 14 to + 20  kms@xmath9 ) hiemission is shown in figure  [ fig - co+hi ] overlaid with contours of co integrated over the same velocity range and the 18  cm radio image of the snr .",
    "the overall large scale morphology of the atomic gas is consistent with that of the molecular gas .",
    "the hi  gas follows the distribution of the large co shell , with hi  emission peaks not always coinciding with the co peaks , as is commonly found between atomic and molecular gas .",
    "thus , hi  material is present in the region towards g349.7 + 0.2 .",
    "the density , size , and luminosity of g349.7 + 0.2  are similar to those proposed by @xcite for galactic snrs expanding into an intercloud medium , and to those of compact snrs in other galaxies @xcite .",
    "these remnants are expanding into molecular clouds , but because of the clumpy structure of molecular clouds and the small filling factor of dense clumps , the remnant is mostly expanding into an intercloud medium with densities 525  @xmath3 @xcite . indeed , the molecular cloud associated with g349.7 + 0.2  has a density of @xmath68@xmath85  @xmath3 , whereas densities determined from x - ray emitting plasma of @xmath86  @xmath3 are more characteristics of an intercloud hi  medium .",
    "this high density of ambient medium results in a rapid snr evolution and a large amount of swept - up material producing very high luminosity ( @xmath87  ergss@xmath9 ) in a short period just before the snr becomes radiative and starts to cool rapidly .",
    "such remnants can be recognized by a high radio surface brightness ( e.g. , ic  443 and w44 ; * ? ? ? * ) or a strong ir flux @xcite .",
    "the x - ray observations of g349.7 + 0.2  imply that this snr is still dynamically young enough to produce a significant x - ray flux , in addition to strong radio flux .",
    "the radiative part of the shell should be accompanied by a hi shell",
    ". however , high - resolution observations towards g349.7 + 0.2  are needed to investigate the association between the hi  emission and the snr shock .",
    "the solar abundances and large x - ray emitting mass derived from _ asca _ observations imply that the x - ray emitting gas in g349.7 + 0.2  is dominated by swept - up interstellar material @xcite .",
    "the implication is that , similar to the case of the snr n132d in the large magellanic cloud ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sn ejecta component , expected from such a young snr , is largely hidden by the glow of massive amounts of swept - up material . in the case of n132d",
    ", optical studies showed clear evidence of fast - moving ejecta synthesized in the collapse of a massive star . in x - rays , there was initially no detection of ejecta , but high resolution spectral studies indicated enhanced levels of oxygen @xcite , and the presence of an additional higher temperature spectral component which could be related to the ejecta @xcite . with the _ chandra _ observations",
    ", we clearly detect enhanced abundances of si and possibly of s in g349.7 + 0.2 , which provides the first evidence for the presence of ejecta in this remnant .",
    "similar evidence for the presence of ejecta in two middle - aged large magellanic cloud snrs , 054870.4 and 0534 - 69.9 , with substantial amount of swept - up material ( @xmath88@xmath19 ) has been presented by @xcite , who derive enhanced fe abundance based on the _ chandra _ spectra of these remnants .",
    "the detection of the enhanced abundances only in the harder spectral component suggests that this component is associated with the sn ejecta , which means that the softer spectral component is related to the forward shock and the swept - up material . if the ambient medium into which the snr is expanding has much lower density than that of the ejecta , the forward shock will be heated to a significantly higher temperature than the ejecta ; this is the case in the young snr cas  a ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , g349.7 + 0.2  is expanding into a dense medium and it is possible that the forward shock is cooler than the ejecta .",
    "the assumed density gradient in the ambient medium could yield enhanced s in just the western - most region , as hinted at in the data ; the amount of swept - up material is lowest there because of the low ambient density , which enables the ejecta component to have a larger filling factor relative to the eastern regions where the ambient density is higher .",
    "indeed , the fits to all the other regions ( 1 through 5 ) could accommodate a contribution from the plasma component of region 6 with an emission measure an order of magnitude lower than the components listed in table  3 .",
    "the lower limit on the fractional mass of ejecta can be inferred from @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the measured abundance , and @xmath91 is the standard solar mass fraction ; for si and s the mass fractions are 6.96@xmath61 and 4.79@xmath61 , respectively @xcite .",
    "using the measured abundances from region 6 , we derive @xmath92@xmath61 and @xmath93@xmath61 .",
    "the observed emission measure in region 6 implies a gas density of @xmath94  @xmath3 , which for an emission volume of @xmath1@xmath95  @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) gives a total mass in the region of @xmath98@xmath19 .",
    "the mass of the observed si and s ejecta is thus @xmath99@xmath19  and @xmath100@xmath19 , respectively .",
    "this is a significant fraction of the amount produced by 1315@xmath19stars ( si : 0.0470.07@xmath19 , s : 0.0260.023@xmath19 ; * ? ? ?",
    "oh(1720  mhz )  maser emission such as that associated with g349.7 + 0.2  and ic  443 , has been found in about 10% of the galactic snrs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "seven of these maser - emitting ( me ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) snrs have been studied in detail in x - rays , and all of them are found to be of the mixed - morphology ( mm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) class of snrs .",
    "mm remnants , also known as thermal composites , are identified by shell emission in the radio band , and centrally brightened thermal emission in the x - ray band with little or no shell brightening .",
    "the evolutionary characteristics which lead to mixed - morphology x - ray properties in snrs are not well understood , and different models have been suggested to explain individual cases .",
    "one such model invokes evaporation of clouds which are left relatively intact after the passage of the snr blast wave and are evaporating in the snr interior @xcite .",
    "another model explains the emission for the mixed morphology snr w44 @xcite as due to the effect of thermal conduction in the remnant interior .",
    "another model for mixed morphology snrs invokes shell - like snr evolution at the edge of a molecular cloud , in which the ambient density gradient does not lie in the projection plane @xcite .    a possible correlation between me and mm snrs has been suggested , because both types of snrs appear to be associated with molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "the fact that some mm snrs do not have oh masers is not unexpected because very specific physical conditions are required for the maser excitation .",
    "however , it has been suggested that all me snrs could be of the mm class @xcite .",
    "g349.7 + 0.2  is then an example of a me snr which does not exhibit mm morphology .",
    "its morphology , which is not centrally peaked , can be explained by the projection effect model used to explain mm snrs as well @xcite .",
    "as shown in previous sections , we are likely seeing the snr expanding into a density gradient of an angle of @xmath81 . if we were to observe the expansion along the direction of the density gradient , we would see centrally peaked x - ray emission rather than two overlapping shells .",
    "another example is the only me snr in the large magellanic cloud , n49 @xcite .",
    "this remnant also has an irregular shell morphology in both radio and x - rays , with a bright region to the south - east ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can similarly be explained as resulting from expansion in a density gradient produced by the presence of a molecular cloud , as mapped by @xcite .",
    "thus , if me and mm snrs are the same class of the snrs and there is a single mechanism to explain their appearance and spectral characteristics , the observations of g349.7 + 0.2  would support the projection model .",
    "identifying more cases of snrs expanding into density gradients seen under different angles might provide further support for the projection model and contribute towards understanding the nature of mm snrs .",
    "we present high - resolution _ chandra _ observations of a small - diameter snr , g349.7 + 0.2 .",
    "its x - ray morphology is almost identical to that at radio wavelengths , and is consistent with expansion into a density gradient viewed at an angle of @xmath81 .",
    "we investigated the atomic and molecular material in the vicinity of the snr , and suggest that the snr belongs to the class of snrs expanding into an intercloud medium discussed by chevalier ( 1999 ) .",
    "the interaction with the molecular cloud is probably limited to the central portion of the snr , where the snr shock became radiative and the shocked material radiates mostly in the ir band @xcite .",
    "g349.7 + 0.2  belongs to a class of maser - emitting snrs which have been suggested to be related to the mixed - morphology class of snrs .",
    "g349.7 + 0.2  does not exhibit mixed - morphology , but its brightness distribution can be explained with the projection model for mixed - morphology snrs .    the spectrum from the whole snr can be fitted with two thermal components , produced by distinct swept - up and ejecta plasma contribution . the softer component has a plasma temperature @xmath0  kev and is in ionization equilibrium , while the harder component has plasma temperature @xmath1  kev , ionization timescale @xmath101  @xmath3s  and enhanced abundances of si .",
    "the slightly enhanced s in just the western - most part of the snr could , if correct , be explained by a higher filling factor of the ejecta component relative to the swept - up component because of the lower density of the ambient medium in that region .",
    "the column density to the snr of @xmath102@xmath5  @xmath6 derived from x - ray data agrees well with the value derived from hi  and co data .",
    "we find a point source with a small number of counts ( @xmath103 ) close , in projection , to the snr center .",
    "using the column density value found towards the snr and the observed range of photon index values from neutron stars , we estimate the luminosity of the point source in the 0.510.0  kev band to be @xmath104@xmath8  ergss@xmath9 .",
    "this luminosity and the lack of an optical and radio counterpart suggests that the x - ray point source could be the compact object formed by the explosion that also produced in g349.7 + 0.2 .",
