    "early - type galaxies are often regarded as the objects at the final stage of galaxy evolution . throughout many observations , it has been revealed that most nearby early - type galaxies have red colors and very poor contents of cold gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "such observational evidence indicates that early - type galaxies are composed of old stars and that they probably will not have additional star formation in the future .",
    "that is , most early - type galaxies seem to evolve _ passively _ , unlike late - type galaxies with active star formation .",
    "however , since @xcite and @xcite found a considerable fraction of early - type galaxies with blue colors and evidence of current star - formation in the hubble deep field @xcite , the existence of _ blue early - type galaxies _ ( hereafter , begs ) has become a new important factor to be considered in the formation scenario of early - type galaxies .",
    "begs are known to have positive color gradients ( i.e.  center bluer than outskirt ) on average and consist of both old stars and young stars @xcite .",
    "it has been also revealed that the internal color distributions of begs are neither homologous nor symmetric @xcite , and that some begs are suspected to host active galactic nuclei ( agns ) @xcite . unlike typical red early - type galaxies ( regs ) preferring high density environments , begs tend to reside in intermediate or low density environments @xcite .",

    "however , optical spectra are easily obscured by dust , causing the missing of a significant fraction of agns in optical surveys @xcite .",
    "moreover , ground - based spectroscopy ( the sdss spectroscopy ) of bright galaxies in the optical band often suffers the dilution of low - contrast emission lines due to strong emission lines @xcite , which also causes inaccuracy in estimating agn activity .",
    "one of the most powerful tools to probe the sf / agn activity is the spectroscopy in the infrared ( ir ) band .",
    "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ; * ? ? ?",

    "it is known that uv photons excite the vibrational and stretching modes of pah molecules , from the relaxation of which broad ir emission lines ( such as 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 and 11.2 @xmath1 m lines ) are produced @xcite .",
    "such pah emission features are good indicators of sf activity . on the other hand",

    "the observation of our beg targets was conducted during the akari open - time operation , the post - helium phase of the akari observation , in which nir ( @xmath14 @xmath1 m ) imaging and spectroscopic observations are available .    the observation was conducted from november 2008 to august 2009 .",
    "the target begs were observed using the ircz4 astronomical observing template ( aot ) , which is the spectroscopic aot of the irc . between the grism and prism , we selected the grism spectroscopy that has better spectroscopic resolution .",
    "the 1-@xmath9 noise equivalent flux density of the ircz4 grism is about 0.2 mjy , and its spectroscopic resolution is r @xmath15 . as the target positioning option , we used the point source aperture ( np ) , because the typical effective radius of target begs is only several arcseconds . among the successfully - observed 36 targets ,",
    "29 objects were observed twice , while seven targets only once .",

    "thus , we applied the median stacking analysis technique for high s / n .",
    "the steps of the stacking analysis are as follows :    * we used the _",
    "irc spectroscopy toolkit for phase 3 data version 20090211 _ provided by the akari team , for the basic processes such as dark substraction , image flat fielding , spectral flat fielding , image combining , source detection and extraction , sky substraction , wavelength calibration and flux calibration .",
    "* using the sdss spectroscopic redshift , we converted the observer - frame wavelength into the rest - frame wavelength for each object .",
    "since the rest - frame wavelength ranges are different between objects , we trimmed each spectrum with the rest - frame wavelength range of 2.5  4.5 @xmath1 m . *",
    "all trimmed spectra were normalized for the median flux density at @xmath18 @xmath1 m to be identical .",
    "* we stacked the normalized spectra by taking a median .",
    "we also produced several median - stacked spectra in bins of several properties such as optical spectral type , optical color , and [ oii]-based specific star formation rate .",
    "we selected the median stacking instead of mean stacking , because it removes unreal data points ( hot or bad pixels ) more effectively , whereas it improves data quality similarly to that the mean stacking does .",
    "not only the total stacking ( i.e.  stacking all spectra into a single spectrum ) but also subsample stacking was carried out to compare the nir spectral features between subsamples with different optical properties .",
    "we simply estimated the uncertainty of the stacked spectra , by supposing that the spectral noise follows the poisson error and that the s / n is accumulated during the stacking process . that is , @xmath19 where ( s / n)@xmath20 is the s / n of the stacked spectrum and ( s / n)@xmath21 is the s / n of the individual spectra .",
    "we used the power law continuum + 3.29 @xmath1 m pah emission ( gaussian ) formula @xcite to fit the stacked spectra : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the flux density , @xmath24 is the wavelength in unit of @xmath1 m , @xmath25 is the continuum slope , @xmath9 is the gaussian spread in unit of @xmath1 m , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are amplitudes .",

    "<S> a near - infrared ( nir ; @xmath0 m ) spectroscopic survey of sdss(sloan digital sky survey)-selected blue early - type galaxies ( begs ) has been conducted using the akari . </S>",
    "<S> the nir spectra of 36 begs are secured , which are well balanced in their star - formation(sf)/seyfert / liner type composition . for high signal - to - noise ratio </S>",
    "<S> , we stack the beg spectra all and in bins of several properties : color , specific star formation rate and optically - determined spectral type . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the nir continuum slope and the equivalent width of 3.29 @xmath1 m pah emission . in the comparison between the estimated nir spectral features of the begs and those of model galaxies , </S>",
    "<S> the begs seem to be old - ssp(simple stellar population)-dominated metal - rich galaxies with moderate dust attenuation . </S>",
    "<S> the dust attenuation in the begs may originate from recent star formation or agn activity and the begs have a clear feature of pah emission , the evidence of current sf . </S>",
    "<S> begs show nir features different from those of ulirgs , from which we do not find any clear relationship between begs and ulirgs . </S>",
    "<S> we find that seyfert begs have more active sf than liner begs , in spite of the fact that seyferts show stronger agn activity than liners . </S>",
    "<S> one possible scenario satisfying both our results and the agn feedback is that sf , seyfert and liner begs form an evolutionary sequence : sf @xmath2 seyfert @xmath2 liner . </S>"
