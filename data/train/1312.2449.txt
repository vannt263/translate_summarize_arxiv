    "extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) imaging of the inner solar corona gives the most valuable information about the spatial and temporal dynamics of coronal plasma , because this spectral range corresponds to its inherent temperature range of 12  mk .",
    "the temperature sensitivity of the euv emission results in noticeable differences in coronal structures that are seen simultaneously in the euv and white - light spectral ranges during eclipses @xcite .",
    "whereas in white light the corona is routinely studied at distances from disk center ( heliocentric distance ) exceeding 2@xmath0 , in euv the corona is typically observed below 1.3@xmath0 , because ordinary euv telescopes and spectrometers have a limited field of view adapted for imaging of the solar disk with the highest possible resolution .",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , it was found that plasma in solar - minimum streamers is in thermal equilibrium , with the electron , proton and ionic temperatures all at similar values between 1.1 and 1.5  mk .",
    "the first real imaging of the extended euv corona above 1.3@xmath0 at high solar activity was performed in 2002 with the spectrographic x - ray imaging telescope - spectroheliograph ( spirit ) onboard the _ complex orbital observations near - earth of activity of the sun _ ( _ coronas - f _ ) satellite in its coronagraphic mode @xcite .",
    "the telescope operated in the 175    spectral band , which comprises the resonance lines of fe  ix to fe  xi with excitation temperatures around 1  mk . in several",
    "dedicated coronagraphic observations , it was found that the euv corona contained elongated bright ray - like structures stretching from some active regions to distances of 23@xmath0 , with brightness 24 times greater than that of the ambient background corona .",
    "comparison has shown that coronal structures seen by spirit were different from those observed in uvcs scans observing the colder o  vi line , probably due to differences in the emission mechanisms or excitation temperatures .",
    "similar structures have been detected during eclipses in visible lines generated in transitions between higher levels of the same fe  ix  fe  x ions @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that these ray - like structures very likely represent coronal signatures of long living plasma outflows originating at the interfaces between active regions and mid - latitude coronal holes , and contributing to the quasi - stationary component of the slow solar wind @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have shown that outflows are associated with interchange reconnection between closed field lines of active regions and the surrounding open field lines , which introduces a pressure imbalance that drives the plasma outward .",
    "based on this conclusion , we conjecture that plasma outflows propagating along open field lines produce enhancements of density in the corona , which can be seen at the limb as bright , elongated , ray - like structures . in the work of @xcite , and in the present work",
    ", it is shown that these structures correspond spatially to streamers observed above the same active regions by white - light coronagraphs .",
    "therefore , the ray - like structures concerned can be regarded as the euv counterparts of white - light streamers , revealing inner structure that is indistinguishable in visible light .    since its launch on november 2 , 2009 ,",
    "regular euv observations of the corona have come from the sun watcher with active pixels and image processing ( swap ) telescope aboard the _ project for onboard autonomy 2 _ ( _ proba2 _ ) mission @xcite .",
    "this telescope has a single spectral channel at 174   , with high sensitivity to euv emission of the same fe lines as spirit .",
    "the extended corona is imaged by swap in a special off - pointing mode by co - adding several dozen consecutive frames that are obtained with a cadence of 2030 seconds .",
    "the swap telescope has important advantages in studying the corona over similar euv instruments  _",
    "e.g. _ , _ soho _ s euv imaging telescope ( eit ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the _ solar dynamics observatory _",
    "s advanced imaging assembly ( _ sdo_/aia ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  because it has a wide field of view and low stray light , which allow one to see the corona up to 2@xmath0 and beyond .",
    "regular imaging of the sun in this off - pointing mode has shown that , even at low solar activity , the corona often displays large - scale euv structures above active regions with some rays extending up to 2@xmath0 . a photometric analysis of the swap data assists in understanding plasma conditions and the physical mechanisms of coronal euv emission , opening up the possibility of more accurately modeling these .",
    "the role of various mechanisms of euv emission in the extended corona is still not well established due to a lack of observational data on plasma densities and temperatures at these larger distances , which are needed for numerical modeling of coronal euv flux .",
    "commonly , it is supposed that the euv emission of the corona is formed only by collisional excitation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which results , in particular , in widespread use of the emission - measure approach . by default ,",
    "the chianti package @xcite calculates intensities of the aforementioned fe ion lines in the corona by taking into account only the collisional excitation mechanism .",
    "radiative excitation , namely photoexcitation by continuous radiation from the solar disk , is commonly considered only for visible and infra - red lines @xcite .",
    "based on analysis of the 2010 eclipse observations , @xcite determined that radiative excitation by photospheric continuum emission from the solar disk dominates the generation of the monochromatic radiation in the visible fe - ion lines at heliocentric distances as large as 3@xmath0 .",
    "these authors also compared their results with observations in the proba2/swap 174    euv channel , and remarked that collisional excitation is the only excitation process for the fe  x 174    emission since the solar disk has practically no emission shortward of 1000    corresponding to the wavelength range of these fe ion lines .",
    "however , the fe  ix ",
    "fe  xi ions in the upper corona can absorb and re - emit the strong monochromatic euv radiation of those same ions , generated lower in the corona .",
    "this emission corresponds to resonance transitions of the ions , which makes excitation and emission by resonant scattering considerably more effective than excitation by continuum radiation from much colder photosphere ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it should be noted that this efficiency depends to some degree on the matching of spectral profiles between the illuminating and scattered radiation : in particular , this matching decreases in the case of radially - moving coronal plasma , which results in the doppler dimming effect .",
    "the collisional excitation rate of a spectral line is proportional to the product of the ion and electron densities , @xmath4 , whereas the resonant radiative excitation rate is proportional to only the ion density , @xmath5 .",
    "this means that at large distances from the solar surface , where plasma density decreases by 23 orders of magnitude , the contribution of the resonant scattering in the euv emission may become comparable or even dominant . even near the limb , where the electron density is relatively high , the resonant scattering contribution to the radiance of the corona along the line of sight can produce noticeable opacity effects , such as the distortion of intensities and profiles of strong euv and x - ray spectral lines that are often used in spectroscopic diagnostics ( see , e.g. , earlier works of @xcite , @xcite , and more recent works of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . relevant estimates of contributions of collisional and radiative excitation mechanisms in emission of the extended corona depend on the radial distribution of electron density , temperature and bulk velocity in coronal structures , which may be established by a detailed spectroscopic consideration of the observational data .",
    "by contrast , white light coronal emission is caused by the thomson scattering of continuum radiation from the photosphere by free electrons in the corona .",
    "the intensity of this emission is proportional to the first power of density , so this emission decreases with distance more slower than the euv emission and does not depend on plasma temperature .",
    "this paper presents the results of a photometric study of a streamer observed * in * october 2010 with the swap instrument in the 174    spectral band . on october 2021",
    "the streamer was seen at the western limb above active region ar 11112 , stretching to distances of more than 2@xmath0 .",
    "on october 21 , the base of the streamer  from the limb to a distance of 1.2@xmath0  was observed by the euv imaging spectrometer ( eis ) on board the _ hinode _ spacecraft @xcite in a coordinated eis / swap _ hinode _ observing programme ( known as hop 165 ) .",
    "on october 20 the same streamer was observed by the mauna loa mk4 coronagraph , which measured the polarization brightness , @xmath6 , in the streamer produced by the thomson scattering of photospheric continuum radiation by free coronal electrons .",
    "based on the analysis of probable excitation mechanisms , we built a forward model of the coronal emission using assumed radial distributions of electron density and temperature in the streamer and in the surrounding corona .",
    "the parameters of these distributions were then determined in a self - consistent manner , using a solution that gave the best fit of the simulated euv emission to the measured swap and eis data , as well as the best fit of the simulated white - light brightness to the @xmath6 data provided by the mk4 coronagraph . finally , we estimated the relative contribution of resonant scattering in the formation of coronal euv emission for the plasma conditions determined along the streamer .",
    "observations of the corona with swap are described in section 2 . in section 3 , we consider mechanisms of formation of the coronal euv emission in fe ion spectral lines that appear in the swap wavelength band . in section 4 , we describe physical conditions in the inner corona and basic relations for modeling the coronal euv emission .",

    "the optical two - mirror design includes special baffles .",
    "the details of the design and parameters of swap are described by @xcite .",
    "swap observes the extended corona in a special `` paving '' mode when the satellite offsets the telescope main axis in ( heliocentric ) x , y or in both directions , at a fixed angle of 10 arcmin from disk center , to offset the field of view toward the desired part of the corona .",
    "the whole corona is imaged as a mosaic sequentially by four offsets : in northeast , southeast , northwest and southwest directions .",
    "images are typically acquired during two 99-min orbits . in order to prevent the undesirable illumination of the pointing system s star trackers by the earth , the satellite performs four large angle rotations ( lars ) during its orbit , each of 90@xmath10 around the axis directed to the sun . at each lar position , observations last about 20  min , with a cadence of 2030  s thus giving a total of 8090 images in one orbit .",
    "we analyzed the swap images of the extended coronal structure observed at the western solar limb on 20 october 2010 between 01:06:46 and 03:55:26  ut , and on 21 october 2010 between 00:40:26 and 03:04:46  ut ( see fig .",

    "[ fig01b]a ) .",
    "the ar was positioned between two regions of reduced brightness , marked by dot - dashed lines . the potential field source surface ( pfss ) extrapolation model ( we used version 1 of the ssw pfss package described in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows that the magnetic configuration of these regions contains patches of open magnetic field lines of positive and negative polarities next to the ar ( figures [ fig01b]b and [ fig01b]c ) , which can be identified as small coronal holes in hotter lines with _ sdo_/aia .",
    "other parts of the outlined dark regions , aside from the patches of radially directed open magnetic field lines , may be identified as dark canopies filled with dense chromospheric material @xcite .",
    "a large filament is seen to the southeast of the ar center indicating that the neutral magnetic field line crossed the meridian plane in the center of the ar at an angle of @xmath11  65@xmath12 .",
    "the fan rays expanding from both sides of the ar along open field lines suggest a magnetic configuration favorable to the presence of compact outflows @xcite .    on 20 october 2010 ,",
    "when the ar was located at the western limb , it produced a rich structure of diverging coronal rays expanding to a distance of 2@xmath0 , well aligned to the magnetic field lines computed from the pfss solution ( fig .  [ fig01b]d and e ) .",
    "the northern part of the coronal structure at position angles @xmath13 ( measured clockwise from the northern pole ) corresponds to extended but closed loops .",
    "the central and southern parts of the structure ( at larger position angles ) correspond to open field lines .    for our analysis",
    ", we used the level-1 swap fits files , which were processed to correct for dark current , detector bias , flat - field variations , and bad pixels .",
    "the solar images were centered , rotated so that solar north pole was at the top position , re - scaled to a square - pixel format , and exposure time - normalized , so that individual pixel values were expressed in units of dn  s@xmath14 @xcite . for correct removal of stray light , we selected images ( about 80 on each date ) corresponding to the same lar value at which the stray light distribution was measured ( lar=1 ) .",
    "the selected images were co - added for each day and transformed to polar coordinates by linear interpolation . in the polar images , we selected a strip , covering position angles 115@xmath22.5@xmath12 , that contains the longest and brightest radially directed ray in the center of the structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig01c]a ) .",
    "its radial brightness distribution was obtained by averaging over the strip width ( fig .",

    "[ fig05](a ) ( see below ) .",
    "the main obstacle to observing the corona at large heliocentric distances is the level of stray light in the telescope .",
    "stray light in swap is produced by several sources , including small - angle scattering by irregularities of the mirror surface , diffraction by the entrance filter grid and intrinsic scattering of the back - reflected focused light by the rear filter , the first one likely being the main source .",
    "due to the asymmetric optical design , stray light in swap solar images is also anisotropic @xcite .",
    "stray light is commonly described by the wings of the instrument s point spread function ( psf ) , which can be obtained from solar eclipse images using , for example , the blind deconvolution method @xcite .",
    "determination of the psf shape in the far wings is seriously complicated by photon and dark - current noise , which limit the effective distance over which deconvolution can be used , determined by a certain threshold of signal .",
    "the recent version of the solarsoft package @xcite for swap contains an optional procedure to correct stray light by deconvolution with a predefined psf .",
    "however , this procedure can not remove stray light at distances above 1.5@xmath0 , where the signal drops below 1  dn , so we have used an alternative method , which is free from this limitation .    to determine stray light in the direction of the coronal ray",
    ", we analyzed the swap image obtained during the eclipse on 1 july 2011 at 07:55:38  ut , when the moon obscured the corona up to the limb in the southwestern sector ( fig .",

    "after transformation into polar coordinates ( fig .",

    "this direction is close to the position of the coronal ray we analyze at angle 115@xmath22.5@xmath12 . in principle",
    ", the signal in the obscured image contains , in addition to stray light , a contribution from the afterglow of the scintillator deposited on the cmos detector from the previous , unobscured coronal image , but in our case this component is negligible due to the afterglow s very short decay time ( 13 milliseconds ) with respect to the 30-s image cadence @xcite .",
    "the normalized radial distribution of the signal averaged over the strip width is shown in figure  [ fig01a]c .",
    "this distribution can be approximated by the sum of short - range ( s@xmath15 ) and long - range ( s@xmath16 ) components .",
    "the short - range component is not pure stray light .",
    "it represents the variation of the limb brightness outside the edge of the moon superimposed on stray light inside the edge when the moon shifts during the exposure time ( 10  s ) .",
    "this component can be approximated by gaussian function with a half - width of about 10 pixels ( 32  arcsec ) , which constitutes @xmath17  0.03@xmath0 .",
    "after subtraction of the short - range component , we evaluated the long - range component of the signal , which corresponds to stray light produced by scattering of the focused image by high - spatial frequency irregularities on the mirror s surface @xcite with a minor contribution due to the intrinsic back - reflected light @xcite .",
    "this component is well modeled by a cubic polynomial exponent .    to obtain the radial dependence of stray light along the streamer ,",
    "the long - range component was normalized to the signal at a distance of 2.5@xmath0 , where we expect stray light to dominate .",
    "this procedure slightly overestimates stray light ( to less than 10% ) at distances above 2@xmath0 , but we did not use this region for analysis of coronal radiation due to large statistical errors .",

    "<S> wide - field euv telescopes imaging in spectral bands sensitive to 1  mk plasma on the sun often observe extended ray - like coronal structures stretching radially from active regions to distances of 1.52@xmath0 , which represent the euv counterparts of white - light streamers . to explain this phenomenon , </S>",
    "<S> we investigated the properties of a streamer observed on october 2021 , 2010 by the _ proba2_/swap euv telescope together with the _ hinode_/eis spectrometer ( hop 165 ) and the mauna loa mk4 white - light coronagraph . in the swap 174    band comprising the fe  ix  fe  xi lines , the streamer was detected to a distance of 2@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the euv emission is dominated by collisional excitation and resonant scattering of monochromatic radiation coming from the underlying corona . </S>",
    "<S> below 1.2@xmath0 , the plasma density and temperature were derived from the _ </S>",
    "<S> hinode_/eis data by a line - ratio method . </S>",
    "<S> plasma conditions in the streamer and in the background corona above 1.2@xmath0 from disk center were determined by forward - modeling the emission that best fit the observational data in both euv and white light . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that plasma in the streamer above 1.2@xmath0 is nearly isothermal , with a temperature @xmath1  mk . </S>",
    "<S> the hydrostatic scale - height temperature determined from the evaluated density distribution was significantly higher ( 1.72@xmath20.08  mk ) , which suggests the existence of outward plasma flow along the streamer . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that , inside the streamer , collisional excitation provided more than 90% of the observed euv emission ; whereas , in the background corona , the contribution of resonance scattering became comparable with that of collisions at @xmath3 . </S>"
