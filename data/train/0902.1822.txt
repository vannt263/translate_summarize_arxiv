    "in recent years a significant attention has been devoted to investigation of low - dimensional asymmetric simple exclusion processes ( aseps ) @xcite .",
    "they play a critical role for understanding fundamental properties of non - equilibrium phenomena in chemistry , physics and biology .",
    "aseps have been widely utilized for description of traffic phenomena @xcite , kinetics of biopolymerization @xcite , protein synthesis @xcite , and biological transport of motor proteins @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using asymmetric exclusion processes for studying mechanisms of non - equilibrium phenomena is due to the fact that some homogeneous versions of aseps can be solved exactly via matrix - product approach and related methods @xcite .",
    "in addition , understanding of processes in aseps can be achieved by utilizing a phenomenological domain wall approach @xcite . in order to have a more realistic description of different non - equilibrium phenomena aseps with inhomogeneous distribution of rates",
    "are required . however , there is a limited number of studies dealing with aseps with disorder in the transition rates at sites ( static impurities ) @xcite and with disorder associated to particles s hopping rates ( moving impurities ) @xcite . in this case",
    "exact solutions are not obtained , and extensive monte carlo computer simulations and approximate theories are utilized in order to understand particle dynamics .",
    "disorder has a strong effect on the behavior of aseps .",
    "even a single defect bond far away from the boundaries lead to dramatic effects in the stationary properties both in closed @xcite and open boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "it was shown recently that the dynamics of aseps is also influenced by several defects that are close to each other @xcite , although the mechanism of this phenomenon is not well understood .",
    "this interaction between defects is important for understanding several biological transport phenomena @xcite .",
    "recently the particular case of two defects has been extensively investigated by monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the system current exhibits a notable dependence on the distance between defects with equal hopping rates .",
    "moreover , it was found that the density profile is linear between defects which marks the existence of wandering shock between defects @xcite .",
    "the case of two defective sites with equal rate has been generalized to include extended objects @xcite .",
    "theoretical efforts to analyze aseps with disorder have been mostly directed to the cases with a single or few defects @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite asep with open boundaries and with a local inhomogeneity in the bulk has been investigated by arguing that the defect bond divides the system into two coupled homogeneous aseps .",
    "this theoretical approach can be called a _ defect mean - field _ ( dmf ) because the mean - field assumptions are made only at the position of local inhomogeneity .",
    "although a good agreement with computer simulations has been found , there were significant deviations in statistical properties of the phase with the maximal current that was attributed to the neglect of correlations at the defect bond in the proposed theory @xcite .",
    "a related approach called _ interacting subsystem approximation _ ( isa ) has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for aseps with a single defect or several consecutive defects ( bottleneck ) .",
    "here it was suggested that due to the defect bonds there are 3 segments in the system : two homogeneous aseps are coupled by a segment that includes all sites that surround defect bonds .",
    "explicit results have been used inside the segments , and mean - field assumptions have been utilized for particle dynamics between the segments",
    ". a better agreement with monte carlo computer simulations has been found , and the method was also successfully applied to describe interactions of defects with boundaries .",
    "it was argued that isa can be used for analyzing properties of general aseps with disorder @xcite .",
    "however , isa has not been applied for the systems with 2 defects at finite distances from each other , and because of this observation it is difficult to apply isa for understanding mechanisms of more complex inhomogeneous asymmetric exclusion processes .",
    "a slightly different method of calculations has been proposed by chou and lakatos @xcite , who applied a _ finite segment mean - field theory _ ( fsmft ) . according to this approach ,",
    "the segment of finite length @xmath0 that covers the defect and surrounding sites is considered , and its dynamics is fully described by solving explicitly for eigenvectors of the corresponding transition rate matrix . the segment is then coupled in the mean - field fashion to the rest of the system .",
    "however , this approach becomes numerically quite involved for cluster sizes larger than @xmath120 , and it also limits its applicability .",
    "different studies of asymmetric exclusion processes with disorder point out to importance of correlations in the system .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that correlations are stronger near the slow defect sites .",
    "however , it is not clear how far from the local inhomogeneity and how fast these correlations decay .",
    "in addition , it is also unclear how correlations from two close defects affect each other .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate the role of correlations in dynamics of aseps with disorder . by analyzing several analytical approaches in combination with extensive monte carlo computer simulations",
    "it will be shown that a successful description of disordered driven diffusive systems can be achieved by properly accounting for correlations near the defect bonds .",
    "we investigate a totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes with disorder . in the one - dimensional lattice the particle at the site @xmath2 can jump forward with the rate @xmath3",
    "if the next site @xmath4 is unoccupied , otherwise it stays at the same place . the particle can enter the system with the rate @xmath5 if the site is empty , and it can also exit the lattice with the rate @xmath6 .",
    "when all @xmath7 we have a homogeneous asep for which dynamic properties are known explicitly from exact solutions @xcite . aseps with disorder correspond to the situation when there is inhomogeneities in the transition rates , and @xmath3 are drawn from arbitrary distributions .",
    "numerous theoretical and computational studies indicate that in the limit of large times the dynamics in the system can be determined by comparing entrance rate , exit rates and the transition rate at the slowest defect bond @xcite .",
    "this observation has a significant consequence for properties of aseps with disorder , yielding a generic phase diagram with 3 phases . when the entrance is a rate - limiting process the system can be found in the low - density phase , while for slow exiting the high - density phase governs the system .",
    "if the rate - limiting process is the transition via the slowest defect bond the system is in the maximal - current phase . in this maximal - current phase ,",
    "a segregation of density profile into macroscopic high and low regions occurs at the location of slowest defect bond .",
    "other defects only perturb the density profile on a local scale .",
    "however , when the number slowest defect bonds exceeds two or more the above picture needs modification .",
    "furthermore , the previous studies on disordered aseps lack investigations on correlation effects induced by defects . to address these questions",
    ", we analyze the simplest model with 2 identical defects in the bulk of the system far away from the boundaries .",
    "it was shown earlier @xcite that positioning of the slow defects close to the boundaries leads only to rescaling of the effective entrance and/or exit rates , and we will not consider this possibility in this paper . note that in this paper we are using terms of defect bonds and defect sites . to clarify",
    ", we define the defect site as the site @xmath2 from which the particle hopes to the site @xmath4 with the rate @xmath8 .",
    "correspondingly , the bond connecting sites @xmath2 and @xmath4 is a defect one .      consider a totally asymmetric exclusion processes with open boundaries and with 2 slow defective sites at @xmath9 and @xmath10 at a distance @xmath11 with @xmath12 ( separated by @xmath13 normal sites ) , as shown in fig .",

    "the more interesting case is when the dynamics in the system is governed by transitions via local inhomogeneities . in this phase , which has the maximal current",
    ", we expect to have density phase segregation similar to the case a single defect aseps .",
    "we emphasize that all our investigation in this paper is on this maximal - current phase .",
    "first consider a lattice segment after the second defect .",
    "the dynamics in this part of the system is controlled by the entrance of particle via the defect , then it has a low - density profile with unknown bulk density @xmath18 .",
    "similar arguments can be used to analyze the density profile in the segment before the first defect . here",
    "the flux is limited by the exit rate via the local inhomogeneity , leading to the high - density phase . since at stationary - state condition",
    "the flux through any segment should be the same , @xmath19 , the bulk density in this segment is equal to @xmath20 .",

    "having @xmath57 , it is possible to iterate equations ( in forward direction ) and obtain @xmath151 up to @xmath152 .",
    "then we proceed to find @xmath153 by incorporating the relation @xmath154 . at this stage",
    "it is not possible to proceed further because both @xmath155 and @xmath156 are unknown and we have only one relation between them : @xmath157 . in order to proceed , we approximate @xmath155 in the following way",
    ". consider the rate equation for the 2-point function @xmath158 which is governed by the following master equation :    @xmath159    in the steady state , the left hand side becomes zero , and therefore two terms on the right hand side will be equal . to proceed further we have to approximate 3-point functions .",
    "this is achieved by utilizing the cluster mean - field assumption @xcite . according to this assumption",
    "we replace any three point function by the product of 2-point functions as follows ,    @xmath160    we then replace all 2-point functions by the product of 1-point functions except @xmath161 .",
    "then it is possible to express @xmath162 in terms of @xmath163 and @xmath155 .",
    "after some algebra a quadratic equation for @xmath155 is obtained :    @xmath164    the physically reasonable solution for this equation is given by    @xmath165    now it is possible to find @xmath156 via equation @xmath157 .",
    "analogous to the above procedure we can find @xmath166 as follows :    @xmath167    after having @xmath166 we simply obtain @xmath168 via equation @xmath169 .",
    "now it would be possible to proceed iteratively after taking into account some approximation .",
    "to this end we recall the equality    @xmath170    putting the left hand side equal to zero in the steady state , utilizing cluster mean - field in three point functions and finally substituting @xmath171 by @xmath172 we arrive at the following equation :    @xmath173    note that we have approximated @xmath174 by the mean - field relation @xmath175 .",
    "we can iterate equation ( 53 ) together with @xmath176 from @xmath177 to @xmath178 to find the corresponding @xmath179 and @xmath131 up to @xmath180 . the site",
    "@xmath181 needs to be treated separately .",
    "following the same strategy we easily find :    @xmath182    from which one can compute @xmath183 . in a similar fashion , we can obtain @xmath184 .",
    "we only should shift up all the subscripts in equation ( 54 ) by one .",
    "now it is possible again to proceed iteratively to the end of the chain and evaluate @xmath185 which gives us the output current @xmath186 .",
    "if the given value of input @xmath57 were correct , the output current @xmath186 , which is @xmath187 , should be the same , up to a given precision , as the input value of @xmath57 . by systematically increasing the input @xmath57 in an small amount @xmath188",
    ", we can determine the correct @xmath57 and correspondingly the mean densities @xmath189 together with correlators @xmath190 . in fig .",
    "( 10 ) the dependence @xmath57 on @xmath15 obtained by the numeric scheme devised above is sketched . for the sake of comparison",
    ", we have augmented the figure with the analogous graphs obtained by mf , dmf , isa and mc methods .",
    "obtained by various analytical and numerical methods and mc simulation .",
    "@xmath57 approaches to 0.25 when @xmath15 tends to one in accordance to normal asep .",
    ", width=264 ]    the result of the numerical scheme is almost identical to isa method .",
    "they both are in very good agreement with monte carlo simulations .",
    "however , the numerical scheme has an advantage over isa method in the sense that it can easily be implemented for any @xmath11 , whereas finding the solution of the isa nonlinear set of equations , i.e. , eq .",
    "( 29 ) is not an easy task even by employing advanced numerical methods .",
    "finally in figure ( 11 ) we have sketched the dependence of @xmath57 on @xmath11 obtained from mc simulation and the numeric scheme .     for @xmath191 and @xmath192 obtained by the numeric method and mc simulation .",
    ", width=264 ]    the results of the numeric method are in rather good agreement with those obtained by mc simulations .",
    "@xmath57 is an increasing function of @xmath11 and becomes saturated after some short @xmath15-dependent distance .",
    "the results confirms the earlier finding in @xcite .",
    "note that the length scale on which @xmath57 recovers its single - defect value is of the same order of magnitude of the correlation length in the density profile near boundaries .",
    "finally we would like to add that our numerical scheme is not capable of reproducing the profile of correlators obtained via mc simulations .",
    "figure ( 12 ) depicts the profile of unnormalised adjacent two - point correlation function @xmath193 for two methods of simulation and numerical scheme .     and @xmath113 .",
    ", width=264 ]    we see that within the numerical framework both the value and the extension of correlators are small in comparison to the simulation results .",
    "the reason lies in the implementation of a series of approximation in several places in this numerical algorithm .",
    "an open asep chain with two defective sites with reduced hopping rates @xmath8 has been investigated .",
    "the system current and mean site densities at defective sites and their vicinities have been obtained by two analytical methods namely defect mean - field ( dmf ) and interacting subsystem approximation ( isa ) .",
    "both methods combine mean - field approach near defects with known exact solutions .",
    "our results are accomplished by extensive monte carlo simulations .",
    "we focus on the phase - segregated phase in which defects globally affect the system properties and the system is not input / output rate - limited but rather defect - limited .",
    "mc simulations have revealed strong short ranged correlations at the defective sites and at all the site between them .",
    "additionally , the profile of density between defects takes a linear form which marks the existence wandering shock in this intermediate region . in order to take into account these correlations ,",
    "we have introduced a numerical approach which utilizes a cluster mean - field assumption .",
    "comparison of the three methods show that isa and the numeric approach give a current value which is in a good agreement with mc simulations .",
    "dmf method however , only gives a good results compared to mc and other two methods for small @xmath15 less than @xmath194 which is due to strong correlations .",
    "furthermore , we have obtained the profile of neighbouring two - point correlation function throughout the chain .",
    "it is shown that these two point correlators exhibit a rather strong anti correlation at the first defective site then they grow to the middle of the defects and after that they start diminishing . in general , two point correlators will tend to a tiny value when @xmath15 approaches one .",
    "however , the dependence of two point correlators for a fixed @xmath15 as a function of distance between defects is not monotonous . despite reaching to an asymptotic value for large distances",
    ", one observes a peak at short distances for the two point correlators near defects .",
    "our theoretical analysis indicates that correlations are critically important for dynamics of particles in disordered aseps .",
    "it also shows that it is possible to devise an approximate method that can take into account these correlations , providing a satisfactory description of stationary properties .",
