    "matrix multiplication is one of the most fundamental tasks in mathematics and computer science .",
    "while the product of two @xmath1 matrices over a field can naturally be computed in @xmath2 arithmetic operations , strassen showed in 1969 that @xmath3 arithmetic operations are enough @xcite .",
    "the discovery of this algorithm for matrix multiplication with subcubic complexity gave rise to a new area of research , where the central question is to determine the value of the exponent of square matrix multiplication , denoted  @xmath4 , and defined as the minimal value such that two @xmath1 matrices over a field can be multiplied using @xmath5 arithmetic operations for any @xmath6 .",
    "it has been widely conjectured that @xmath7 and several conjectures in combinatorics and group theory , if true , would lead to this result @xcite .",
    "however , the best upper bound obtained so far is @xmath8 , as we explain below .",
    "coppersmith and winograd @xcite showed in 1987 that @xmath9 .",
    "their approach can be described as follows .",
    "a trilinear form is , informally speaking , a three - dimensional array with coefficients in a field @xmath10 . for any trilinear form  @xmath11",
    "one can define its border rank , denoted @xmath12 , which is a positive integer characterizing the number of arithmetic operations needed to compute the form . for any trilinear form  @xmath11 and any real number @xmath13 $ ]",
    ", one can define a real number @xmath14 , called the _ value _ of the trilinear form . the theory developed by schnhage @xcite shows that , for any @xmath15 and any @xmath13 $ ] , the following statement hold : @xmath16 here the notation @xmath17 represents the trilinear form obtained by taking the @xmath18-th tensor power of  @xmath11 .",
    "coppersmith and winograd presented a specific trilinear form @xmath19 , obtained by modifying a construction given earlier by strassen @xcite , computed its border rank @xmath20 , and introduced deep techniques to estimate the value @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , they showed how a lower bound @xmath22 on @xmath21 can be obtained for any @xmath13 $ ] by solving an optimization problem . solving this optimization problem",
    ", they obtained the upper bound @xmath23 , via statement ( [ statement ] ) with @xmath24 and @xmath25 , by finding the smallest @xmath26 such that @xmath27 .",
    "they then proceeded to study the tensor power @xmath28 and showed that , despite several new technical difficulties , a similar approach can be used to reduce the computation of a lower bound @xmath29 on @xmath30 to solving another optimization problem of several variables .",
    "they discovered that @xmath31 ^ 2 $ ] , due to the fact that the analysis of @xmath28 was finer , thus giving a better upper bound on @xmath4 via statement ( [ statement ] ) with @xmath24 and @xmath32 .",
    "solving numerically the new optimization problem , they obtained the upper bound @xmath9 .    in view of the improvement obtained by taking the second tensor power ,",
    "a natural question was to investigate higher powers of the construction @xmath19 by coppersmith and winograph . investigating the third power",
    "was explicitly mentioned as an open problem in @xcite .",
    "more that twenty years later , stothers showed that , while the third power does not seem to lead to any improvement , the fourth power does give an improvement @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the improvement was obtained again via statement ( [ statement ] ) , by showing how to reduce the computation of @xmath33 to solving a non - convex optimization problem .",
    "the upper bound @xmath34 was obtained in @xcite by finding numerically a solution of this optimization problem .",
    "it was later discovered that that solution was not optimal , and the improved upper bound @xmath35 was given in  @xcite by exhibiting a better solution of the same optimization problem .",
    "independently , vassilevska williams  @xcite constructed a powerful and general framework to analyze recursively powers of a class of trilinear forms , including the trilinear form @xmath19 by coppersmith and winograd , and showed how to automatically reduce , for any form @xmath11 in this class and any integer @xmath36 , the problem of obtaining lower bounds on @xmath37 to solving ( in general non - convex ) optimization problems .",
    "the upper bound @xmath38 was obtained  @xcite by applying this framework with @xmath24 and @xmath39 , and numerically solving this optimization problem .",
    "obtained for the eighth power is stated as @xmath40 in the conference version  @xcite , the statement has been corrected to @xmath38 in the most recent version @xcite , since the previous bound omitted some necessary constraints in the optimization problem .",
    "our results confirm the value of the latter bound , and increase its precision . ]",
    "a natural question is to determine what bounds on @xmath4 can be obtained by studying @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "one may even hope that , when @xmath43 goes to infinity , the upper bound on @xmath4 goes to two .",
    "unfortunately , this question can hardly be answered by this approach since the optimization problems are highly non - convex and become intractable even for modest values of  @xmath43 .    in this paper",
    "we show how to modify the framework developed in @xcite in such a way that the computation of @xmath44 reduces to solving @xmath45 instances of _ convex _ optimization problems , each having @xmath45 variables . from a theoretical point a view , since a solution of such convex problems can be found in polynomial time , via statement  ( [ statement ] ) we obtain an algorithm to derive an upper bound on  @xmath4 from @xmath41 in time polynomial in @xmath43 . from a practical point of view",
    ", the convex problems we obtain can also be solved efficiently , and have several desirable properties ( in particular , the optimality of a solution can be guaranteed by using the dual problem ) .",
    "we use this method to analyze @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and obtain the new upper bounds on  @xmath4 described in table  [ table : chart ] . besides leading to an improvement for  @xmath4",
    ", these results strongly suggest that studying powers higher than  32 will give only negligible improvements .",
    "our method is actually more general and can be used to efficiently obtain lower bounds on @xmath48 for any trilinear forms @xmath11 and @xmath49 that have a structure  similar \" to  @xmath19 .",
    "indeed , considering possible future applications of our approach , we have been attentive of stating our techniques as generally as possible .",
    "to illustrate this point , we work out in the appendix the application of our method to an asymmetric trilinear form , originally proposed in @xcite ."
