    "the lifting of the degeneracy of the energy levels in molecule by a magnetic field is a well - known and well - studied phenomenon .",
    "thus it has spawned experimental techniques such as laser magnetic resonance spectroscopy @xcite , magnetic rotation spectroscopy @xcite , and optical zeeman spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "these techniques , for example , use the zeeman effect to tune transitions in and out resonance by changing the applied magnetic field @xcite .",
    "zeeman effects can also be probed directly using standard spectroscopic techniques to study molecules in magnetic fields @xcite . in a similar fashion",
    ", zeeman effects are increasingly being used to form , probe and trap molecules at ultra - cold temperatures @xcite for example by use of magnetically tunable feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "spectral shifts and splittings provide a remote sensing technique with which to study the universe .",
    "zeeman splitting of molecular spectra are actively being used to probe magnetic fields in a variety of astronomical environments including sunspots @xcite , starspots @xcite , white dwarfs @xcite m - dwarfs @xcite and potentially exoplanets @xcite .",
    "the zeeman splitting patterns of the spectrum of an open shell diatomic molecule can be calculated in a straightforward fashion provided that the quantum numbers characterizing states in question are known and are conserved .",
    "however , there are circumstances , such as resonance interactions between nearby states via spin - orbit or other couplings where the quantum numbers used to specify the electronic state associated with a given level are not precisely conserved . in this case evaluation of zeeman splitting as represented by the land @xmath0-factor is not straightforward and requires a numerical treatment .",
    "it is such a treatment which is the focus of the present article .",
    "the important advantage of the zeeman effect is that the associated splitting can be made large enough to separate otherwise degenerate spin - components ( @xmath3-doublet ) .",
    "moreover , the measurement of the @xmath0 values can be more accurate than the energy spacing @xcite .",
    "the zeeman methodology for diatomics was introduced by schade @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the perturbations in the calculation of the landfactors caused by interactions with other electronic states . in a very recent theoretical work borkov _",
    "@xcite presented a numerical model of zeeman splitting based on the use of effective molecular hamiltonians .",
    "le roy s level @xcite has become the program of choice for solving the diatomic nuclear motion problem .",
    "however , level can only treat open shell molecules in limited circumstances @xcite and does not consider the coupling between states by spin - orbit and related effects which can have an important effect of the @xmath0-factors .",
    "for this reason we have written our own diatomic nuclear motion code duo @xcite .",
    "duo explicitly treats open shell systems and can allow for coupling between the various states involved . in this context , of particular interest to us are the many open - shell diatomic molecules which are known to be present , or may be present , in hot astronomical atmospheres such as those found in cool stars and exoplanets .",
    "such species are being studied as part of the exomol project @xcite .",
    "zeeman splittings in these molecules can provide useful information on the magnetic fields present in these distant bodies .",
    "so far exomol has created spectroscopic models for a number of open shell diatomic species @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present extension to duo which allows land @xmath0-factors to be computed for individual states of open shell systems . as initial examples we focus on four systems studied by exomol , namely alo @xcite , no @xcite , crh @xcite and c@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "these systems were selected as ones of interest for exomol and for which there are laboratory zeeman spectra .",
    "these laboratory studies are discussed below .",
    "discussions of the underlying theory and methodology used in duo is given elsewhere @xcite so only key points are considered below .",
    "duo solves the diatomic nuclear motion problem using a hund s case ( a ) basis .",
    "this does not represent an approximation even for molecules poorly represented by hund s case ( a ) since a complete set of angular momentum functions are used for a given total angular momentum , @xmath4 .",
    "we note that the same choice has been adopted by others @xcite .",
    "the basis set used by duo can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath3 is the projection of electron angular momentum on the molecular axis ; @xmath6 is the electron spin quantum number with projection @xmath7 along the molecular axis and @xmath8 is corresponding projection of @xmath4 .",
    "the vibrational quantum number is given by @xmath9 and the label ` state ' is used to denote the electronic state which is required for both the state - dependent angualar momenta and the vibrational state .",
    "@xmath10 is the projection of the total angular momentum along the laboratory axis @xmath11 and is therefore the magnetic quantum number which quantizes the splitting of the levels in a weak magnetic field .",
    "finally , @xmath12 is simply a compound index representing the various quantum numbers .",
    "these basis functions are symmetrized to give a definite parity , @xmath13 . only @xmath4 and @xmath13 are conserved quantum numbers with the addition of u / g for homonuclear molecules .",
    "duo obtains the wavefunctions for a given nuclear motion problem by diagonalizing a coupled - states hamiltonian .",
    "these wavefunctions , @xmath14 , are then given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the electronic state .",
    "in the case of weak magnetic fields , the zeeman splitting can be approximated by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the shift in energy of a state with total angular momentum @xmath4 and projection of @xmath4 along the field direction is @xmath10 , @xmath2 is the land  factor , @xmath19 is the bohr magneton , @xmath20 is the magnetic field . within a hund s case ( a ) representation ,",
    "the land @xmath0-factor is given by @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the standard electron spin and orbital @xmath0-factors respectively .",
    "if @xmath3 and @xmath7 are conserved quantities for a given rovibronic state then this expression is analytic ; below this will be known as the qn(a ) approximation meaning good quantum numbers in hund s case ( a ) .",
    "the good - quantum number approximation has been also introduced and used in the case of the nih spectroscopy by gray _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "here we used @xmath2 as a total land  factor which includes all other contributions from the electron spin and orbital angular momenta ; this is different from the definition conventionally used in zeeman experimental studies , see , for example , gray _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the corresponding expression for the hund s case ( b ) land  factor can be approximated by @xcite @xmath24 } { n ( n+1 ) } \\right\\ } \\notag \\\\ & + &   \\frac{g_s}{2 j(j+1)}\\left [ j(j+1 ) - n(n+1 ) + s(s+1)\\right ]   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the rotational quantum number . if @xmath3 and @xmath25 are conserved quantities for a given rovibronic state then this expression is analytic ; below this will be known as the qn(b ) approximation meaning good quantum numbers in hund s case ( b ) .    the intermediate ( and more general ) case can be modeled using the @xmath26 matrix with the following matrix elements @xcite : @xmath27    in practice @xmath3 and @xmath7 are not generally conserved when spin - orbit and other curve coupling effects are taken into account . in this case",
    "one can use the duo wavefunctions to compute @xmath2 for a given rovibronic state by averaging over the corresponding wavefunction as given by @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the values of @xmath6 , @xmath3 and @xmath7 taken in basis function @xmath12 and @xmath33 .",
    "case ( a ) . in the following",
    "we also assume @xmath34 and @xmath35 . to help interpret our results we define the difference between @xmath2 s evaluated using duo wavefunctions and using the qn approximation as given by .",
    "@xmath36 where ( x ) is ( a ) or ( b ) as appropriate .",
    "as an initial test case land @xmath0-factors were computed for aluminium oxide ( alo ) . the spectroscopic model used for alo is due to patrascu _",
    "@xcite which is based on _ ab initio _",
    "curves tuned to reproduce the extensive set of experimental spectra .",
    "the model comprises three electronic states : x  @xmath37 , a  @xmath38 and b  @xmath37 .",
    "the latter two states lie , respectively , 5406 and 20688 @xmath39above the ground states .",
    "the closeness of the x and a states leads to significant mixing .",
    "a recent study of radiative lifetime @xcite using this model showed strong effects due to x  a mixing but that the b state appeared largely unperturbed .",
    "figure  [ fig : alo ] shows the difference between @xmath2 s evaluated using duo wavefunctions and using the qn approximation these results show systematic effects .",
    "firstly , it would appear that the @xmath2-factors for the x  @xmath37 and b  @xmath37 are significantly better represented in the hund s case ( b ) than case ( a ) .",
    "secondly , the a  @xmath38 appears closer to hund s case ( a ) , although in this case the differences are smaller .",
    "finally , there are a number perturbations caused by a coupling between levels in the x and a states .",
    "such interactions have been noted before @xcite .",
    "changes due to the x  a state coupling appearing as well pronounced structures in fig .  [",
    "fig : alo ] suggest that the b state @xmath0-factors are largely unchanged from the idealised values . in order to illustrate how the coupling between different states affect the values of the land  factors in fig .",
    "[ f : coupling ] we show energy crossings between the x ( @xmath40 ) and a ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) rovibronic states ( upper display ) .",
    "the spikes in the @xmath4 progressions of the landfactors ( lower display ) appear at the same @xmath4 values ( 13.5 and 21.5 ) as the two crossings .",
    "this is where the wavefuncitons are extremely mixed and the quantum number approximation , eq .  ( [ equation : lande_hunds_a ] ) , becomes very poor .",
    "the net effect from the duo model even in case of strongest couplings of alo is still relatively small , of the order of @xmath44 for @xmath45 see fig .",
    "[ f : alo : duo : a : b ] .",
    "figure  [ f : alo : duo : a : b ] shows the @xmath2 values computed using the three methods : duo wavefunctions , hund s case ( a ) and hund s case ( b ) approximations for the x ( @xmath46 ) state .",
    "the character of @xmath2 changes from ( b ) to ( a ) as energy increases , illustrating importance of the proper modelling of the zeeman effect .",
    "we should note the study by gilka _",
    "@xcite , where the effects of couplings between orbital- and spin - angular momenta of the x and a states on the @xmath22 values were also studied in their _ ab initio _ calculations of the @xmath0-tensor of alo .",
    "[ [ no ] ] no ~~    the nitric oxide ( no ) molecule provides a rather simple test of our methodology .",
    "_ @xcite recently constructed a spectroscopic model and generated the associated line list for no considering only the x  @xmath38 electronic ground state .",
    "_ consider all 6 major isotopologues of the system ; here we restrict ourselves to @xmath47 for which there are some limited , experimental studies on the behavior of its ground state ro - vibrational transitions in a magnetic field , albeit a relatively strong one @xcite .",
    "these observations have been subject of recent models @xcite which show that for most of the field strengths considered it was necessary to move beyond the linear zeeman effect considered here .",
    "we note the zeeman effect in no has also been used to ascertain the distribution of no in the martian atmosphere @xcite .    the spectroscopic model of mcconkey _",
    "_ @xcite made extensive use of experimental data in determining both the shape of the x  @xmath38 potential energy curve and the various coupling terms .",
    "however even with a high quality fit their model does not predict transition frequencies with the accuracy required for studying the relatively small zeeman splittings . we therefore follow mcconkey _",
    "et al . _ and adopt as our zero - field energy levels the empirical values they determine .",
    "the experimental study of ionin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite only considered in detail the splitting of the @xmath48 q(2.5 ) fundamental transition at 1875.7228 @xmath39 as a function of magnetic field .",
    "there strategy was to use the magnetic field to tune the transition into resonance with co laser lines .",
    "observed 3 components of this transition , namely the @xmath49 ones associated with @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 which they observed using the co laser line @xmath53 p(15 ) which lies at 1876.30 @xmath39 . bringing the lines into resonance required magnetic fields of approximately 3.8 , 4.2 and 5.6 t respectively .",
    "strong fields are required since the @xmath0 factors for the ground and first excited vibrational states are fairly similar so the transition frequency only depends weakly on @xmath20 .",
    "if the zeeman splittings were linear then the three lines considered would all lie at the same frequency . in practice",
    "this is only true up to about 2 t and for fields above this value the quadratic zeeman effects become increasingly important @xcite .",
    "the previous studies suggest that only the @xmath54 transition frequency varies approximately linearly with field strength in the 2  6 t region .",
    "our calculations place this transition at 1876.29 @xmath39 for a field of 3.8 t , in excellent agreement with the observations .",
    "this values are obtained from our calculated @xmath2 factors of 0.316625 and 0.316857 for the @xmath48 @xmath55 state of @xmath46 and @xmath56 respectively .",
    "the carbon dimer is a very well studied system @xcite whose spectrum is widely used for studying astronomical and terrestrial plasmas .",
    "the many systems of c@xmath1 electronic bands are well - known to have many perturbations due to couplings between states , something that should be reflected in the land @xmath0-factors .",
    "the exomol model for c@xmath1 considers the eight lowest electronic states of c@xmath1 : , , , b@xmath57  @xmath58 , , , , and .",
    "due to strong interactions between rovibronic states in this system especially at high rotational excitations , the quantum numbers becomes meaningful and therefore very difficult to correlate between hund s cases .",
    "therefore we restrict ourselves to states with @xmath59 and energies up to 35,000 @xmath39 .",
    "figure [ fig : c2 ] gives an overview of our computed land @xmath0-factors for c@xmath1 .",
    "it is clear that for this system the changes caused by coupling between states are large .",
    "apart from the characteristic spikes as in the case of alo , these land  factors show that these deviated values also build well defined horizontal patterns .",
    "these patterns should indicate a deviation of the c@xmath1 spectra from hund s case ( a ) .",
    "the transition from hund s cases ( a ) and ( b ) for different @xmath4 is a well - known issue in the analysis of the rovibronic spectra of c@xmath1 , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "as a third example we consider the crh molecule , another astronomically important species .",
    "the exomol model @xcite for this system considers the lowest 8 electronic states : x  @xmath60 , a  @xmath61 , a  @xmath60 , b  @xmath62 , b  @xmath63 , c  @xmath64 , c  @xmath65 and the lowest dissociative @xmath66 state .",
    "here we consider states with @xmath67 and energies up to 35,000 @xmath39 . as the model used does not consider electronic states with thresholds above 20,000 @xmath39 , where new states become increasingly dense , it is likely that our calculations will underestimate the perturbation of the @xmath0-factors in this region .",
    "however even below 10,000 @xmath39 , where the states all belong to x  @xmath60 electronic state the perturbations are fairly large .",
    "figure [ fig : crh ] gives an overview of our computed land @xmath0-factors for the lowest two sextet states of crh compared to the qn approximations .",
    "clearly there are lots of structures .",
    "for the x  @xmath60 state , qn  ( a ) appears a poor approximation in all cases ; qn  ( b ) does better but still shows pronounced structures starting at about 4000 @xmath39 . above about 14000 @xmath39  all x state @xmath2 factors appear highly perturbed .",
    "this is also true for the singlet a state .",
    "chen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite measured effective @xmath0 values for a few levels in crh ; table  [ tab.crh ] compares these measurements ( a  @xmath60 , @xmath56 ) with our results .",

    "the agreement for other levels is not as good , suggesting that our model for crh needs further improvement .",

    "we have developed a numerical procedure for evaluating land @xmath0-factors for diatomic molecules without making any assumptions about conserved quantum numbers .",
    "this method is tested for four molecules",
    "alo , no , c@xmath1 and crh",
    ". it would seem that besides making predictions for @xmath0-factors , the comparison between our computed value and the value predicted under the assumption of particular hund s case gives a clear means of distinguishing those levels which are best represented by hund s case ( a ) from those which are approximately hund s case ( b)-like .    the accuracy of our predicted @xmath2 factors depend on a number of factors : ( a ) the accuracy of the underlying spectroscopic model used and , in particular , its ability to reproduce coupling between different electronic states , ( b ) our ability to solve this model by , for instance , converging the basis set representation and ( c ) any assumptions made about angular momentum couplings within the system .",
    "although our procedure is based on a hund s case ( a ) coupling scheme , our general formulation means that no actual approximations are made by adopting a ( complete ) basis formulated within this scheme .",
    "similarly it is relatively easy , and computationally cheap , to use large vibrational basis sets when converging the problem .",
    "this means that the choice of spectroscopic model is likely to be the major source of uncertainty in our calculations or , conversely , that available measurements of land @xmath0-factors have the potential to be used to improve the spectroscopic model .",
    "in addition we note that our formulation is only appropriate when the changes depend linearly with the magnetic field .",
    "inclusion of non - linear effects require a more sophisticated treatment which we plan to study in future in work .",
