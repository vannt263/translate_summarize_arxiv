    "however , the later one is computationally inexpensive and it provides relaiable energy band gaps as comparable with more sophisticated methods within the ks frame work . this semi local tb - mbj potential is obtained from simple modification of becke - johnson ( bj ) potential @xcite by the introduction of local parameter * c * into bj potential leading to tb - mbj potential as    @xmath20    where @xmath21 = @xmath22 is the electron density , @xmath23 = @xmath24 is the kinetic energy density , @xmath25 is the becke - roussel potential , and * c * = @xmath26 + @xmath27 , where @xmath26 , @xmath28 are two free parameters and @xmath29 is the unit cell volume .",

    "therefore , it requires a denser k - mesh to integrate this property accurately than for a normal self consistent calculation and hence we have used 14x14x14 for ( li / na)no@xmath0 and naclo@xmath0 , 15x18x10 for kno@xmath0 and 17x14x11 for kclo@xmath0 for optical properties calculation .",

    "the alkali metal nitrates and chlorates are analogous to simple alkali halides but the presence of planar nitrate and trigonal chlorate anions make the crystal structure more complex . also these materials are similar to alkali metal azides with a difference in the arrangement of atoms in an anionic group such that nitrates , chlorates and azides possesses planar , trigonal and linear anions , respectively . from our earlier work , we found that the dispersive interactions play a major role in predicting the structural and vibrational properties of ionic alkali metal nitrates and azides at ambient as well as at high pressure.@xcite apart from this , dft - d2 method is successful in explaining the phase stability by accounting for the missing dispersive interactions in ionic cesium halides.@xcite hence , in the present work , we have also used the dft - d2 method to calculate the structural properties of the investigated compounds and the obtained equilibrium volumes differ by @xmath35 0.56 - 2.9@xmath4 when compared to experimental data.@xcite as seen in table [ str1 ] , the relative errors with dft - d2 method are small , which clearly show the success of the method in reproducing the structural properties of these oxidizing materials over standard dft functionals .",

    "the previous calculations show that the volume of @xmath26-phase is severely underestimated around 34.7 @xmath4@xcite and 15.3 @xmath4@xcite within lda and the volume of cmc2@xmath41 super structure is overestimated by 4.5 @xmath4 within pbe - gga even at higher plane wave cut - off energies.@xcite thus the standard lda / gga functionals are unsuccessful in predicting the phase stability of kno@xmath0 polymorphs.@xcite hence , we turn our attention to reproduce the experimental geometries thereby predicting the phase stability of the polymorphs using dft - d2 method .",

    "[ str2 ] , we conclude that the dispersive interactions play a major role rather than number plane waves required for reproducing the experimental results for kno@xmath0 polymorphs .",

    "the bands are very narrow ( flat ) as commonly expected for ionic crystals .",
    "overall , we observe mixed bonding nature @xmath61 predominant ionic bonding between metal ( li , na , k ) cation and no@xmath0/clo@xmath0 anion and covalent bonding between n / cl and o atoms within the no@xmath0/clo@xmath0 anionic group in the bulk oxyanionic crystals which is consistent with the previous theoretical calculations on these materials.@xcite     + @xmath36ref.@xcite , @xmath37ref.@xcite , @xmath38ref.@xcite , @xmath39ref.@xcite , @xmath46ref.@xcite , @xmath47ref.@xcite , @xmath48ref.@xcite , @xmath49ref.@xcite [ gaps ]      in order to understand photo sensitive decomposition mechanisms in the energetic formulations , we try to shed more light on optical properties of these materials .",
    "very limited studies are available in the literature to explore the optical properties of these oxidizers .",
    "vorobeva et al@xcite measured the reflection spectra and quantum yield photo emission of alkali metal nitrates and chlorates and they reported that anionic and cationic excitations occur in the low ( @xmath60 20 ev ) and high ( @xmath62 20 ev ) energy region , respectively . photo emission and reflection spectra of mno@xmath0 ( m = na , k , rb , and cs)@xcite and naclo@xmath0@xcite",
    "were measured in the fundamental absorption region .",
    "optical spectra of metal ( li , na , k ) nitrites , nitrates , chlorates , perchlorates , sulfites , and sulfates were calculated using crystal package within lda . as discussed in the above section the band gaps",
    "are severely underestimated using standard dft functionals which plays a key role in calculating the optical properties ( dielectric function , refraction , reflectivity , and loss function etc . ) therefore , in the present study , we attempt to study the electronic transitions , refractive index and reflectivity through the calculated optical spectra for the five solid oxidizers using recently developed tb - mbj potential . in general optical properties can be described by means of complex dielectric function @xmath75 = @xmath76 + @xmath77 , where @xmath76 , and @xmath78 represent the dispersive and absorptive part of the complex dielectric function @xmath75 .",
    "the imaginary part of dielectric function @xmath78 is obtained from the momentum matrix elements between the occupied and unoccupied wave functions within selection rules and the real part of @xmath75 can be extracted from the kramers - kronig relationships using @xmath78 .    as shown in figure [ epsilon ]",
    "the peaks ( a , b , c , d , e , and f ) in the @xmath78 spectra along distinct crystallographic directions based on the crystal symmetry show that inter band transitions between occupied valence band and unoccupied conduction band .",
    "the optical transitions corresponding to each peak are given in table 4 of the supplementary material for all the studied compounds .",
    "it is found that the optical transitions below 20 ev are due to anionic states or n / o / cl @xmath1 metal ( li , na and k ) atom whereas in the high ( above 20 ev ) energy region the transitions are due to cationic ( k : p@xmath1d ) states , this can be clearly seen from figure [ epsilon ] for kno@xmath0 and kclo@xmath0 , and this is in very good agreement with quantum yield photo - emission measurements.@xcite as illustrated in figure [ reflection ] , the calculated reflectivity spectra reveal that the maximum reflection occurs at about 10 ev for ( li / na)no@xmath0 and naclo@xmath0 while it is around 25 ev for potassium based oxidizers , and also the calculated spectra is consistent with the available experimental spectra at 9 k and 298 k.@xcite the calculated static refractive index are displayed in table 5 of the supplementary material .",
    "a high value of refractive index represents the covalent bonding in a material , among the investigated compounds lino@xmath0 possesses the highest refractive index value implying that it is more covalent than other studied compounds and refractive index values decrease from li @xmath1 na @xmath1 k ( na @xmath1 k ) in nitrates ( chlorates ) which shows that covalent ( ionic ) nature decreases ( increases ) in the same order for these materials . the calculated distinct static refractive index as a function of photon energy",
    "as shown in figure [ refraction ] for the investigated compounds indicates that these materials are optically anisotropic crystals except naclo@xmath0 which is an isotropic crystal due to its cubic crystal symmetry and it is also found that above @xmath35 20 ev these materials becomes optically isotropic up to maximum studied photon energy range .",
    "in summary , ab - initio calculations have been performed to investigate the structural , elastic , vibrational , electronic , and optical properties of solid oxidizers mno@xmath0 ( m = li , na , k ) and mclo@xmath0 ( m = na , k ) based on dft .",
    "the calculated structural parameters are in good agreement with the experimental data in contrast to lda and/or gga results which show a large deviation from the experiments due to their inability in treating the weak dispersive interactions in ionic - molecular solids . moreover",
    ", this method is successful in predicting phase stability of kno@xmath0 polymorphs .",
    "the calculated elastic constants at dft - d2 equilibrium volume show that these materials are mechanically stable at ambient pressure .",
    "the obtained elastic and bulk moduli for the investigated compounds decrease in the following order : li @xmath62 na @xmath62 k ( na @xmath62 k ) for nitrates ( chlorates ) due to increase in ionic size of the metal atom resulting low values of the elastic moduli indicating soft nature of the potassium - based compounds .",
    "we have calculated zone centre phonon frequencies and made a detailed vibrational assignment for the internal and lattice modes .",
    "we also noticed that the presence of metal ( li , na , k ) cation with nitrate / chlorate anion leads to an increase in the internal degrees of freedom in a crystal . from the calculated ir and raman spectra",
    ", it is found that the vibrational frequencies show red shift from li @xmath1 na @xmath1 k ( na @xmath1 k ) and n @xmath1 cl for nitrates ( chlorates ) due to increase in mass of the metal and non - metal atoms , respectively .",
    "we have also calculated the electronic structure and optical properties of these materials using tb - mbj potential and the calculated band gaps are found to improve over lda / gga functionals .",
    "the calculated electronic structure shows that these compounds are wide band gap insulators .",
    "predominant ionic bonding between metal cation and nitrate or chlorate anion and covalent bonding ( n - o / cl - o ) is present within nitrate / chlorate anion from the calculated pdos which is consistent with the previous reports on these materials .",
    "we have also analysed electric - dipole transitions between valence band and conduction band , which are due to nitrate / chlorate group below 20 ev and cationic transitions occur above 20 ev from the calculated optical spectra and the calculated reflectivity spectra is consistent with the experimental data .",
    "we have also observed that these are optically anisotropic materials ( except naclo@xmath0 ) and their anisotropic nature decreases in the high energy region .",
