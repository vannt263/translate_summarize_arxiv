    "quantum field theory ( qft ) on curved space - time is a semi - classical approximation to quantum gravity in which quantum fields evolve on a fixed background described by a classical metric .",
    "an object of fundamental importance in qft on curved space - time is the renormalized expectation value of the stress - energy tensor ( set ) @xmath0 .",
    "this governs the back - reaction of the quantum field on the space - time geometry via the semi - classical einstein equations @xmath1 ( we use natural units in which @xmath2 ) . the expectation value of the set and other physical observables are calculating using the feynman propagator",
    "this can be found either by construction , using the time - ordered product of the field operator , or by directly solving the inhomogeneous field equations , using appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "qft on curved space - time is considerably more complicated than quantum field theory on minkowski space - time . on minkowski space - time",
    ", there is a natural definition of a global vacuum state as seen by an inertial observer .",
    "defining a vacuum state on a general curved space - time is a subtle procedure and there may be more than one natural choice of vacuum state .",
    "the choice of vacuum state affects the boundary conditions used to construct the appropriate propagator .    in this paper , we focus on the maximally symmetric anti - de sitter ( ads ) space . according to the ads / cft ( conformal field theory ) correspondence ( see @xcite for a review ) , quantum gravity in the bulk of ads is equivalent to a cft which lives on its time - like boundary .",
    "this motivates our study of qft on ads .",
    "we focus on fermion fields as these describe all known matter particles but have received less attention in the literature than quantum scalar fields on curved spaces .",
    "the maximal symmetry of ads enables us to write the feynman propagator in a relatively simple closed form using the bi - spinor of parallel transport @xcite .",
    "considering the global ads vacuum , we use the hadamard method @xcite to calculate the vacuum expectation value ( v.e.v . ) of the set .",
    "we also find the thermal expectation values ( t.e.v.s ) of the fermion condensate ( fc ) and set .",
    "in addition to the results for the massless dirac field presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , expressions for the t.e.v.s for arbitrary mass are included .",
    "we next consider the construction of thermal states as seen by an observer rotating with a constant angular velocity @xmath3 about a fixed axis .",
    "the construction of the vacuum state proceeds in analogy to that for a rotating observer on minkowski space @xcite .",
    "when the angular velocity is smaller than the inverse radius of curvature @xmath4 of ads , the rotating vacuum and its corresponding feynman propagator coincide with those for the global non - rotating ads vacuum . in this case , relatively simple expressions for the t.e.v.s of the fc , set and neutrino charge current ( cc ) can be obtained . if @xmath5 , the rotating and ads vacua no longer coincide .",
    "since the maximal symmetry of ads is broken by the presence of a prefered axis , the feynman propagator must be constructed using a mode sum . in this case",
    ", we only give numerical results here and leave full details to be presented in a dedicated paper @xcite .",

    "furthermore , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are time - like vectors tangent to this geodesic at @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , obeying @xmath30 .    in general relativity , fields at different space - time points @xmath20 and @xmath21",

    ", geodesic theory defines the bi - vector @xmath31 and bi - spinor @xmath32 of parallel transport , which perform the parallel transport of tensors and spinors , respectively , from point @xmath21 to point @xmath20 along the connecting geodesic .",

    "a similar effect arises in minkowski space , where defining rotating thermal states relative to the global minkowski vacuum gives rise to t.e.v.s containing temperature - independent terms @xcite which are not present if the rotating vacuum is used instead .    ads has a time - like boundary which quantizes the non - rotating mode energies . as a result of this energy quantization",
