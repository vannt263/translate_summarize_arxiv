    "one of the great observational discoveries of recent times is the realization that we live on a cosmic web which is embedded in an accelerating universe .",
    "although an accelerating universe was originally established using high redshift type ia supernovae @xcite , the case for a ` dark energy ' dominated universe has received independent support from observations of the cosmic microwave background @xcite combined with studies of galaxy clustering in the two degree field ( 2df ) galaxy redshift survey @xcite .",
    "although the nature of dark energy is still an open issue , a cosmological constant appears to agree very well with all current observations which indicate @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( for reviews of dark energy see @xcite ) .",
    "fully three dimensional large scale galaxy catalogues reveal that the cosmic web consists of an interpenetrating network of superclusters and voids .",
    "it therefore becomes important to understand and quantify the geometrical and topological properties of large scale structure in a cdm cosmology in a deep and integrated manner .",
    "the main aim of the present study is to study the supercluster - void network in cdm cosmology with emphasis on the sizes , shapes and topologies of individual superclusters and voids .",
    "we shall also study the percolation properties of the full excursion set sampling the entire density field and quantify our results in terms of minkowski functionals ( hereafter , mfs ) . a study such as",
    "the present one will help us in comparing theory against observations .",
    "it will also help us to distinguish the salient features of cdm cosmology from sister cosmologies in which dark energy is a function of time .",
    "( these issues will be discussed in detail in companion papers . )",
    "it may be appropriate to mention that this is the first comprehensive analysis of large scale structure geometry and morphology in which over - dense ( superclusters ) and under - dense ( voids ) regions are treated on a completely equal footing .",
    "earlier studies have emphasized either over - densities ( clusters , superclusters ) or under - densities ( voids ) as a result of which the methods used for the analysis of these two complementary entities ( superclusters / voids ) often vary greatly in the literature .",
    "thus over - dense regions have been studied using correlation functions , minimal spanning trees , shape functions etc . , whereas voids have been constructed from point processes using elaborate boundary and volume filling techniques ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "although the above methods do provide us with some insights into supercluster - void morphology , we shall follow an alternative route in this paper and study the properties of the supercluster - void network using the density field as our main starting point and fundamental physical quantity .",
    "the reason for this is two fold , firstly , density fields can be easily constructed from point data sets using , for example , cloud in cell ( cic ) techniques ( this is true both for data from n - body simulations , which we examine in this paper , as well as for galaxy distributions in three dimensions ) .",
    "secondly , an elaborate surface modeling scheme , surfgen ( short for ` surface generator ' ) , allows us to determine the geometry , morphology and topology of excursion sets defined on a density field in a very comprehensive manner @xcite .",
    "applying surfgen to the density distribution in the cdm model allows us to develop deep insights into the distribution of large scale structure in this model , which can be quantified using mfs and shapefinders .",
    "working with the density field also permits us to determine the morphological properties of the _ full excursion set _ describing the supercluster - void network .",
    "more detailed information is then gleaned at one particular threshold ( usually associated with percolation ) at which shapes and sizes of individual superclusters and voids yield rich information about properties of the cosmic web to which we belong .    concretely , we study the large scale structure of the universe by considering the geometry and topology of isodensity surfaces @xmath8 . at a given threshold @xmath9 regions having higher than threshold density ( @xmath10 )",
    "will be called `` superclusters '' , while regions with @xmath11 will be called `` voids '' .",
    "thus , we define superclusters and voids as over - dense and under - dense connected regions bounded by one ( or several ) surfaces of constant density .",
    "this definition broadly corresponds to other definitions of superclusters and voids used in the literature but differs in details .",
    "apart from obvious differences with superclusters and voids of galaxies in redshift space our approach specifies neither a particular density threshold nor the shapes of the structures . despite these differences we call the objects of our study superclusters and voids mostly because they are nonlinear structures having sizes , volumes and masses roughly corresponding to superclusters and voids of galaxies .",
    "we study superclusters and voids at a large number of density thresholds and construct the isodensity surfaces at every threshold to best accuracy .",
    "in contrast to many studies ( see @xcite ) , we do not ` cook up ' voids or superclusters with predefined shapes but isolate individual objects from the dark matter density field obtained in the n - body simulations by building the isodensity surfaces . apart from uniformly smoothing the density field with a gaussian filter",
    ", we do not introduce any factors that may affect the shapes or substructure in superclusters and voids of the cosmic density field .",
    "filtering the density field may erase some small - scale features but it certainly does not introduce any new structures .",
    "thus , we know beforehand that the real structure can be only richer and more elaborate compared to what we study after smoothing . filtering high frequency modes is virtually implied in every physics study .",
    "this approach can be also viewed as an application of the standard excursion set technique to non - gaussian three - dimensional fields .",
    "one of the goals of this work is a quantitative and objective testing of some stereotypes routinely used in cosmology .",
    "here are a few examples : both n - body simulations and redshift surveys are characterized by filamentary and sheet - like or pancake - like structures ; voids are quasi - spherical bubbles in the density and/or galaxy distributions ; and expand faster than the universe as whole ; voids occupy most of the volume in the universe .",
    "the first problem arises when one tries to address these issues in the absence of conventional definitions .",
    "frequently the context of the origin and usage of a particular assertion is either obscure or forgotten .",
    "proving that some of the above cliches can not be true does not require elaborate n - body simulations or sophisticated analysis .",
    "for instance , voids can not _ both _ occupy most of the universe and expand faster than the universe because this would require the expansion of voids in _ comoving space_. but",
    "this is impossible since the comoving volume is conserved !",
    "therefore , the expansion of some voids must clearly be at the expense of some of the others .",
    "this is one of the trivial ( but important ) conclusions arising from the adhesion model @xcite . at the same time it is not necessary for the interior of the squeezed voids to shrink .",
    "the interior of the void may continue to expand faster than the hubble flow but the void eventually vanishes because its boundaries move _ inwards _ @xcite .",
    "so as the void collapses it is likely to become increasingly non - spherical .",
    "thus , a single expanding void model while being reasonable for a crude estimate of substructure growth may be completely misleading for estimating the sizes of a realistic ensemble of voids .",
    "pancakes or sheet  like structures remain an unsolved controversy since their theoretical prediction by zeldovich in 1970 . on the one hand",
    "there were numerous assertions that they had been detected in the n - body simulations or redshift surveys most of which were based on visual impressions . on the other ,",
    "many believe that pancakes are not clearly seen in any realistic n - body simulations and have not been detected objectively .",
    "it is worth noting that the simulation of the structure in the hot dark matter model did not show the existence of pancakes @xcite which was interpreted as the result of weak singularities corresponding to pancakes compared to considerably stronger singularities corresponding to filaments @xcite .",
    "the coarse graining unavoidable in n - body simulations erases pancakes while filaments survive .",
    "this argument has been essentially repeated by @xcite and elaborated for the probabilistic interpretation of the large - scale structure . in this study of the cdm model",
    "we do not see pancakes either .",
    "the large  scale structure in the dark matter density field is certainly different from the one observed in galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "galaxies are at best pointwise tracers of the parent continuous dark matter density field .",
    "it is likely that they are biased tracers , and that they do not display real physical structures but structures which are strongly distorted by the mapping into redshift space .",
    "thus , the observed superclusters and voids are not physical but only apparent objects as the retarded motion of some planets is only apparent but not real motion . at present",
    "there are only two methods of investigating real large ",
    "scale objects : by reconstructing the real space density field from peculiar velocities of galaxies and by investigating the density fields in the models that are consistent with observations such as cdm .",
    "we consider this study of the dark matter density field in real space as a first step in a systematic study of the morphology of large - scale structure .",
    "it will be followed by studies of mock and real galaxy catalogues .",
    "understanding the morphology of the dark matter distribution in real space is an important component in understanding the physical processes determining the formation of galaxies and their motions as well as for building theoretical models of superclusters and voids .    due to the fairly large smoothing scale adopted here , the over - density in superclusters ranges from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , which makes them more extended ( @xmath14 few mpc ) and considerably less dense than galaxy clusters in ( for instance ) the abell catalogue .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : simulations ] we briefly describe the density fields used in this study . in section [ sec : morph_param ] we define and very briefly discuss the morphological measures which we apply to study the cosmic web .",
    "[ sec : perc_topol ] provides the relation of the filling factors used in this study with the probability density function .",
    "5 discusses the morphological properties of individual superclusters and voids .",
    "6 describes substructure in superclusters and voids .",
    "a discussion of some properties of minkowski functionals is contained in sec .",
    "section 8 summarizes our main results .",
    "we use dark matter distributions in a flat model with @xmath15 = 0.3 , @xmath16 = 0.7 , @xmath17 ( cdm ) .",
    "the initial spectrum was taken in the form suggested by @xcite with the shape parameter @xmath18 .",
    "the amplitude ( @xmath19 ) of the power spectrum in the model is set so as to reproduce the observed abundance of rich galaxy clusters at the present epoch .",
    "a detailed discussion of the cosmological parameters and simulations can be found in @xcite .",
    "the density fields generated by the virgo simulations have been studied in several papers ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; this is the first systematic study of global and local morphology when both over - dense and under - dense regions are measured by the same method .",
    "surfgen operates on three - dimensional pixelized maps .",
    "therefore we first generate the density field from the distribution of dark matter particles .",
    "this process was described in detail in @xcite ; here we present a brief summary .",
    "the data consist of @xmath20 particles in a box of size 239.5 1 mpc .",
    "we fit a @xmath21 grid to the box .",
    "thus , the size of each cell is 1.875 1 mpc .",
    "here we follow the smoothing technique used by @xcite which they adopted for their preliminary topological analysis of the virgo simulations . in the first",
    ", we apply a cloud in cell ( cic ) technique to construct a density field on the grid .",
    "next we smooth this field with a gaussian kernel which offers us an extra smoothing length - scale .",
    "we study the field smoothed with @xmath22 1 mpc but also present the global mfs for the field smoothed with @xmath23 1 mpc for comparison .",
    "the scale of @xmath22 1 mpc is a fiducial smoothing scale in many studies of both density fields in n - body simulations and galaxy fields from redshift surveys ; see for example , @xcite .",
    "the gaussian kernel for smoothing that we adopt here is w(r ) = 1 ( ) ^32 l_s^3 exp(-r^2 l_s^2 ) .",
    "since the kernel is isotropic , it is likely to diminish the true extent of anisotropy in filaments and pancakes .",
    "this effect could be minimized by considering anisotropic kernels and/or smoothing techniques based on the wavelet transform .",
    "an even more ambitious approach is to reconstruct density fields using delaunay tesselations using a technique reported by @xcite .",
    "density fields reconstructed in this manner appear to preserve anisotropic features and may therefore have some advantage over conventional ` cloud - in - cell ' techniques followed by an isotropic smoothing @xcite .",
    "thus , as far as one of the goals is to utilize the geometry of the patterns to discriminate between the models , such smoothing schemes should prove more powerful .",
    "we hope to return to these issues in further publications .",
    "we scan the density fields at 99 values of the density threshold , all equispaced in the filling factor @xmath24 defined as [ eq : ff - def ] ff_c(_th ) = 1 v_tot(-_th ) d^3x , where @xmath25 is the heaviside theta function and @xmath26 is the density contrast .",
    "the supercluster filling factor @xmath27 measures the volume - fraction in regions which satisfy the ` supercluster ' criterion @xmath28 . in the following , we use @xmath27 along with the void filling factor @xmath29 as a parameter to label the density contours .",
    "the relation between @xmath27 and density contrast threshold can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpf ] .    at each level of the density field ( labeled by @xmath27 or @xmath30 ) , we construct a catalogue of superclusters ( over - dense regions ) and voids ( under - dense regions ) based on a grid realization of the friends of friends ( fof ) algorithm .",
    "next we ( i ) run the surfgen code on each of these superclusters / voids to model surfaces for each of them and ( ii ) determine the minkowski functionals ( mfs ) for all superclusters / voids at the given threshold ( these are referred to in the literature as partial mfs ) .",
    "global mfs are partial mfs summed over all superclusters .",
    "thus , at each level of the density , we first compute the partial mfs and then the global mfs .",
    "since the 1970s , theory , n - body simulations , and , most importantly , galaxy redshift surveys have strongly suggested that the components of the large - scale structure can be roughly placed in three classes : compact quasi - spherical or slightly elliptical structures like abell clusters , long filaments like the famous ` bridge ' connecting the coma cluster and a1367 , ( @xcite ) and voids .",
    "there have also been claims that pancake - like concentrations of galaxies have been observed @xcite .",
    "the voids have often been claimed to have quasi - spherical or slightly elliptical shapes .",
    "most of these claims have been based on visual impressions . in particular , statistics used in studies of voids often assumed that voids are spherical or close to spherical thereby precluding any other possibility .    in this work",
    "we study the geometry and topology of the regions bounded by the isodensity surfaces and therefore make no prior assumptions about the shapes of superclusters and voids .",
    "it is worth noting that some regions may have more than one boundary surface and possess nontrivial topology of the boundaries .",
    "the complete characterization of an arbitrarily complex region in three dimensions obviously can not be achieved if only a few numbers are used . at best",
    "one can try to design some basic characteristics that serve a particular purpose .",
    "our purpose is to provide basic measures suitable for quantification of typical components of the large - scale structure : superclusters and voids .",
    "four minkowski functionals are effective non - parametric descriptors of the morphological properties of surfaces in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "they are    * _ volume _ @xmath31 enclosed by the surface , @xmath32 , * _ area _",
    "@xmath33 of the surface , * _ integrated mean curvature _ @xmath34 of the surface , [ eq : curv ] c = _ s(1r_1 + 1r_2)da , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the principal radii of curvature at a given point on the surface . * _ the euler characteristic _ [ eq : euler ] = _ s(1 r_1r_2)da .",
    "although for our purpose the euler characteristic is a more convenient quantity than genus , @xmath37 ( see appendix for a discussion ) the latter has been used more often in cosmology .",
    "the genus is uniquely related to the euler characteristic @xmath38 and thus carries exactly the same information .",
    "we measure the above parameters for every region in both over - dense and under - dense excursion sets at 99 density thresholds equispaced in the filling factor from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite particular ratios of minkowski functionals called `` shapefinders '' provide us with a set of non - parametric measures of sizes and shapes of objects .",
    "therefore , in addition to determining mfs we shall also derive the shapefinders , @xmath41 ( thickness ) , @xmath42 ( breadth ) and @xmath43 ( length ) defined as follows : [ eq : tbl ] t = 3va ,   b = ac ,  l = c4 .",
    "the three shapefinders describing an individual region bounded by one or several isolated surfaces of constant density have dimensions of length and provide us with an estimate of the regions ` extension ' : @xmath41 is the shortest and thus describes the characteristic thickness of the region or object , @xmath43 is typically the longest and characterizes the length of the object ; @xmath42 is intermediate and can be associated with the breadth of the object .",
    "this simple interpretation is obviously relevant only for fairly simple shapes . the choice of the coefficients in eq .",
    "[ eq : tbl ] results in a sphere having all three sizes equal to its radius @xmath44 .",
    "a triaxial ellipsoid has values of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 close but not equal to the lengths of its three principal semi - axes : shortest , intermediate and the longest respectively .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are only the estimates of three basic sizes ( semi - axes ) of an object which work quite well on such objects as a triaxial ellipsoid and torus @xcite but no three numbers can describe an arbitrary , complex three - dimensional shape .",
    "an indicator of ` shape ' is provided by a pair of dimensionless shapefinder statistics [ eq : shapefinder ] p = b - tb+t ;   f = l - bl+b , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are measures of planarity and filamentarity respectively ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "a sphere has @xmath48 , an ideal filament has @xmath49 while @xmath50 for an ideal pancake .",
    "other interesting shapes include ` ribbons ' for which @xmath51 .",
    "when combined with the genus measure , the triplet @xmath52 provides an example of _ shape - space _ which incorporates information about topology as well as morphology of superclusters and voids .",
    "a characteristic of the density field which is both simple and useful is the one - point probability density function , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 . in this study",
    "we use the integral @xmath55 known as the cumulative probability function ( cpf ) as a major quantity parameterizing the excursion sets .",
    "it measures the fraction of volume in the excursion set , @xmath10 . in order to compare supercluster and void parameters we also use the under - density filling factor @xmath56 the filling factor @xmath57",

    "[ fig : cpf ] we find that the density field is ` nonlinear ' ( @xmath59 ) in a relatively small fraction ( 15% ) of the total volume .",

    "the largest void behaves in a qualitatively similar manner if plotted versus @xmath64 . at @xmath65",
    "its volume is small compared to the volume of the under - dense excursion set , @xmath11 , but at the percolation transition @xmath66 , it takes over and from then on remains the dominant structure in the under - dense excursion set . since @xmath67 the void percolation transition takes place at @xmath68 as shown in fig .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    two obvious conclusions can be drawn from the above discussion .",
    "first , at percolation the object having the largest volume becomes very different from all remaining objects , therefore it must be studied separately .",
    "second , individual objects  both superclusters and voids  must be studied in the corresponding phase _ before percolation occurs _ in the corresponding phase .",
    "both superclusters and voids reach their largest sizes , volumes and masses just before percolation sets in .",
    "figure [ fig : isol_vm ] also shows that at @xmath71 superclusters dominate by volume while at @xmath72 voids dominate . in the range @xmath73 corresponding to @xmath74 , no more than 10% of volume is occupied by non - percolating objects , while the remaining more than 90% of entire volume is occupied by just two largest objects : percolating supercluster and the percolating void . in the range between the two percolation thresholds @xmath62 and @xmath69 , both largest objects percolate and therefore the density field has a sponge like structure .",
    "the interval of sponge like structure in a gaussian field is between @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "therefore nonlinear gravitational evolution has shifted it toward smaller @xmath24 and increased its range by a little bit from 0.68 ( = 0.84@xmath770.16 ) to 0.71 ( = 0.78@xmath770.07 ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that the shift and length of the sponge like interval are determined by the percolation thresholds which in general are two independent parameters . as a result of these shifts the interval of the so called `` meat - ball '' topology ( when no supercluster percolates ) has reduced compared to the gaussian case from @xmath78 to @xmath62 and the interval of the `` bubble '' topology ( when no void percolates ) is increased from @xmath79 to @xmath80 .",
    "all the numbers obviously depend on the adopted smoothing scale but the sign and type of change must be universal for the @xmath0cdm model .    for both superclusters and voids @xmath81 , where @xmath82 stands for the fractional volume occupied by all objects excluding the largest one , and @xmath83 is the fractional volume in the largest object .",

    "a similar result was found in the models with power law initial spectra @xcite .",
    "percolation is characterized by many features , the most conspicuous being the rapid merger of disjoint parts of the excursion set into one connected structure spanning the entire volume .",
    "merging of superclusters occurs when the density threshold is reduced whereas merging of voids correspond to the growth of the threshold .",
    "spanning of the largest supercluster or void throughout the whole volume results in connection of the opposite faces of the cubic volume by this structure which explains the term _",

    "again the particular numbers depend on the choice of the smoothing scale but the sign of the effects is independent of the smoothing scale . at smaller smoothing scales as well as for any adaptive smoothing having a better resolution in high density regions",
    "the supercluster percolation threshold must decrease ( @xmath101 ) and void percolation threshold must increase ( @xmath102 ) . on the other hand , increasing the smoothing scale would result in a continuous reduction of differences between superclusters and voids and their ultimate convergence to gaussian curves in every panel ( not shown ) .",

    "in computing the   of individual large - scale objects ( superclusters or voids ) we assume that the boundary surface of every object is closed however it may consist of several disconnected parts . if the region is cut by a box boundary it is always closed by the corresponding part of the box face .",
    "we also assume that the partial  are measured for all superclusters and voids at the same set of density thresholds . in this case",
    "the evaluation of the global minkowski functionals with periodic boundary conditions can be done as follows .",
    "* _ volume _ : the total volume is obviously independent of the assumption of periodicity @xmath171 where @xmath172 are the volumes of individual superclusters and @xmath173 and @xmath174 denote the global volumes in periodic and non - periodic boxes . * _ area _ : let us denote the total area of the superclusters at given filling factor @xmath175 as @xmath176 and the total area of voids as @xmath177 .",
    "then , the sum of two becomes @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the total area of the excursion set in the box with periodic boundary conditions and @xmath180 is the total area of the box boundary ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : glob_curv ] for an illustration ) . for periodic boundary conditions the global area of the over - dense excursion set obviously equals the global area of the under - dense excursion set since it is the area of the common interface surface . solving the above equation for @xmath179",
    "one obtains @xmath181 * _ integrated mean curvature _ : the isodensity surfaces is constructed by the triangulation described in detail in @xcite .",
    "it is convenient for the further calculation of the global integrated mean curvatures to split the sum into two parts : one is the sum over the inner edges and the other is the sum over the edges lying on the box boundary @xmath182 and @xmath183 for the inner edges the contributions to global mean curvatures of the superclusters and voids have the same magnitude but opposite signs @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the angle between two surface triangles having common edge as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : glob_curv ] .",
    "please note that in this equation we use the angle between the triangle planes while in eq .",
    "6 @xcite we used the angle between the normals to the triangles .",
    "if the edge lies on the box boundary the relation is less trivial .",

    "[ fig : glob_curv ] .",
    "the dashed lines show the projections of the opposite faces of the box .",
    "the plane of the figure is assumed to be orthogonal to the edge lying on the faces of the box and having the length @xmath189 .",
    "this assumption is made only for convenience of the illustration and does not affect the calculation .",
    "we consider the input to the mean integrated curvature from the edge @xmath189 .",
    "the code treats the regions @xmath187 and @xmath188 as two separate regions , therefore @xmath190 = \\pi l_i   -\\frac{1}{2}l_i(\\varphi_i+\\theta_i).\\ ] ] however , if @xmath186 was treated as one region which corresponded to the periodic boundary conditions then we would have @xmath191 thus , each edge lying on the face of the box contributes to the global integrated mean curvature extra @xmath192 compared to the periodic case .",
    "similar reasoning yields for the adjacent void @xmath193 and @xmath194 note that @xmath195 as it should be .",
    "+ for the face edges we have @xmath196 now we have all the terms for equations [ eq : cc_g ] and [ eq : cv_g ] and after simple and straightforward calculations obtain the global mean integrated curvatures for superclusters and voids for periodic boundary conditions in terms of non - periodic quantities @xmath197 +    * _ the euler characteristic _ : three kinds of elements of the triangulated surface are triangle faces , edges and vertices . the euler characteristic of the triangulated surface is @xmath198 where @xmath46 , @xmath199 and @xmath31 are the total numbers of faces ( triangles ) , edges and vertices respectively for both closed and open surfaces .",
    "+ a related measure of topology often used in cosmology is the genus @xmath200 .",
    "although the two quantities are uniquely related and therefore carry exactly the same information the euler characteristic has more convenient mathematical properties . as we shall see below including the surfaces with boundaries ( open surfaces ) into analysis is very useful in many cases in particular in dealing with the boundary conditions . for such surfaces",
    "the genus is fractional : the euler characteristic of a patch is @xmath201 and thus its genus is @xmath202 . as a result",
    "the standard interpretation ( eq . [ eq : genus ] ) can not be directly applied .",
    "secondly , and more importantly , the euler characteristic is additive while genus is not .",
    "it means that the euler characteristic of a set of disconnected surfaces is simply the sum over all members of the set @xmath203 but the genus is not @xmath204 .",
    "for example , three isolated spheres have a genus of @xmath205 while @xmath206 .",
    "in our study we use minkowski functionals for both the global description of the density field and individual objects .",
    "thus , the additivity of a parameter becomes a very useful property .",
    "+ similarly to the previous discussion of the integrated mean curvature we split each number into two : one is the input from the elements lying inside the box and the other from the elements lying on the boundary faces of the box @xmath207 where subscripts `` in '' and `` b '' correspond to the internal elements of triangulation lying inside of the box and on the boundaries of the box respectively . in the periodic case",
    "there are neither triangles nor edges or vertices on the faces of the box , therefore @xmath208 for both superclusters and voids because it is the characteristic of the common interface surface .",
    "+ the boundary group of terms gives different results for superclusters and voids . in the case of superclusters",
    "@xmath209 is the euler characteristic of the `` cluster boundary surface '' i.e. the surface consisting of all regions on the faces of the box that have been used for closing the superclusters cut by the boundary . and",
    "in the case of voids it is obviously the remaining of the box surface which can be called the `` void boundary surface '' @xmath210 .",
    "for instance , consider a simple case when there is only one cluster cut by a box face . assuming non - periodic boundary conditions and",
    "closed boundary surfaces for all superclusters the parts of cluster surface consists of two simply connected pieces each homeomorphous to a circle and thus @xmath211 .",
    "the void boundary surface is homeomorphous to a sphere with two holes ( not tunnels ) and thus @xmath212 . if there were @xmath213 superclusters cut by the box boundaries then @xmath214 and @xmath215 . in general , since the parts of the boundary used for closing the superclusters and the parts used for closing voids make the whole surface of the box @xmath216 since the box surface is homeomorphous to a sphere and therefore is equal to two . summing up the cluster ans void euler characteristics one obtains @xmath217 thus , the global euler characteristic for periodic boundary conditions , @xmath218 can be found if both @xmath219 and @xmath220 are computed at the same threshold under assumption of non - periodic boundary conditions @xmath221 computing @xmath219 and @xmath220 also assumes that all individual clusters and voids have closed surfaces .",
    "the surfaces of superclusters and voids cut by the boundary of the box are closed by necessary parts of the box boundary surface ."
