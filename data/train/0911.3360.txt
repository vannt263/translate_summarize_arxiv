    "studies of both stars and gas are revealing significant structure and asymmetries in their motions and spatial distributions including the bar of stars and gas in the galactic bulge ( @xcite , @xcite ) , the evidence from infrared surveys for a larger stellar bar in the inner disk ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the discovery of the sagittarius dwarf @xcite , and a significant asymmetry of unknown origin in the distribution of faint blue stars in quadrant 1 ( q1 ) of the inner galaxy @xcite .",
    "each of these observations provides a significant clue to the history of the milky way .",
    "when combined with the growing evidence for galactic mergers in addition to the sagittarius dwarf , i.e. the monoceros stream ( @xcite , @xcite ) , the canis major merger remnant ( @xcite ) , the virgo stream ( @xcite , @xcite ) , we now realize that the structure and evolution of our galaxy have been significantly altered by mergers with other systems . indeed",
    "the population of the galactic halo and possibly the thick disk as well , may be dominated by mergers with smaller systems .",
    "the asymmetry in q1 , @xmath2 , first recognized by @xcite was based on a comparison with complementary fields in the fourth quadrant ( q4 ) using star counts from the minnesota automated plate scanner catalog of the poss i @xcite . to map the extent and shape of the asymmetric distribution and further identify the contributing stellar population",
    ", @xcite extended the search to 40 contiguous fields from the digitized poss i on each side of the sun - center line plus the same number of fields below the plane in q1 .",
    "they examined the star count ratios for paired fields in three color ranges : blue , intermediate and red . over 6 million stars",
    "were used in the star count analysis covering almost 2000 square degrees on the sky .",
    "they found a 25% excess in the number of probable thick disk stars in q1 , @xmath3 to @xmath4 and @xmath5 to @xmath6 above and below the plane compared to the complementary fields ( @xmath7 to @xmath8 ) in q4 . while the region of the asymmetry is somewhat irregular in shape , it is also fairly uniform and covers several hundred square degrees .",
    "it is therefore a major substructure in the galaxy due to more than small scale clumpiness . assuming that these are primarily main sequence thick disk stars , with a typical magnitude completeness limit of @xmath9 mag , they are 1 - 2 kpc from the sun and about 0.5 to 1.5 kpc above ( and below ) the plane .    @xcite also found an associated kinematic signature .",
    "using velocities from spectra for more than 700 stars , they not only found an asymmetric distribution in the v@xmath10 velocities , but the thick disk stars in q1 have a much slower effective rotation rate @xmath11 compared to the corresponding q4 stars .",
    "a solution for the radial and tangential components of the v@xmath10 velocities reveals a significant lag of 80 to 90 km s@xmath12 in the direction of galactic rotation for the thick disk stars in q1 .",
    "three possible explanations for the asymmetry are the fossil remnant of a merger , a triaxial thick disk or inner halo , and interaction of the thick disk / inner halo stars with the bar in the disk . given the lack of any spatial overlap with the path of the sagittarius dwarf through the halo @xcite , and the predicted path of the canis major dwarf @xcite , its association with either feature is unlikely .",
    "furthermore its spatial extent and apparent symmetry relative to the plane also do not automatically support a merger interpretation .",
    "our line of sight to the asymmetry is interestingly in the same direction as the stellar bar in the disk @xcite , and the near end of the galactic bar @xcite , but the disk bar is approximately 5 kpc from the sun in this direction .",
    "thus the stars showing the excess are between the sun and the bar , not directly above it . however the maximum extent of the star count excess along our line of sight is not known .",
    "recently @xcite showed the stellar density distribution from the maps scans for the @xcite fields in q1 and q4 above the plane , demonstrating that the excess was in q1 and was not due to a ring above the plane @xcite .",
    "larsen et al named the asymmetry feature the hercules thick disk cloud in recognition of the direction on the sky where the star count excess is maximum .",
    "thus , interpretation of the hercules thick disk cloud is not clear - cut .",
    "while it might well be a fossil merger remnant , the star count excess is also consistent with a triaxial thick disk or inner halo as well as a gravitational interaction with the stellar bar especially given the corresponding asymmetry in the kinematics .",
    "the distinction between a triaxial thick disk and interaction with a disk bar may be difficult to discern .",
    "indeed , it is unclear which may have formed first , and one or both may be the result of mergers .",
    "the release of the sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ) photometry in the direction of the observed asymmetry in q1 led to the discovery of a feature at much fainter magnitudes , the distant hercules - aquila cloud @xcite and also confirmed the nearer star count excess in the inner galaxy @xcite .",
    "the sdss survey however is not well designed for a comprehensive survey of the thick disk inside the solar orbit .",
    "it extends below @xmath13 in only a few directions in q1 and has only limited coverage in q4 .",
    "it does not have the leverage in galactic longitude needed to discriminate among the possible causes of the hercules thick disk cloud .    to further explore the possible origin of the observed spatial and kinematic asymmetry , we have obtained multicolor ccd images to extend the star counts to fainter magnitudes to map the spatial extent of the asymmetry along the line of sight as a function of galactic longitude and latitude .",
    "for example , if the thick disk is triaxial we would expect to observe the star count excess out to greater longitudes , but the star count excess described by @xcite appears to terminate near _ l _",
    "@xmath14 55@xmath15 . however , if it is triaxial in q1 with its major axis above the bar , the stars would be further away at the higher longitudes . by extending the star counts to fainter magnitudes , corresponding to greater distances , we can search for the asymmetry at higher longitudes , from _",
    "l _ of 50@xmath15 to 75@xmath15 .    in this first paper",
    "we describe our observing program and present results on a search for triaxiality of the inner halo and thick disk .",
    "our second paper will discuss the star counts across the full range of longitudes in q1 and q4 containing the asymmetry feature and a third paper in the series will analyze the kinematics of the associated stars . in the next section",
    "we describe the ccd observing program and data reduction .",
    "determination of the star count ratios and their errors for the fields at the higher longitudes are discussed in  3 .",
    "our results do not support a triaxial interpretation of the asymmetry feature and are summarized in  4 .",
    "to map the asymmetry feature both above and below the galactic plane we identified 67 fields ranging in longitude from _",

    "the total sky coverage of the program is 47.5 square degrees .",
    "the distribution of our program fields on the sky is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] and the information for each field is given in table  [ tbl-0 ] with their galactic and equatorial centers , instrument , field size and date of observation . in this paper",
    "we will be discussing a subset of the fields relevant to the triaxiality question .",
    "these fields are circled on figure  [ fig1 ] and are listed in table  [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "our program required observations in both hemispheres .",
    "we used the steward observatory 2.3 meter bok telescope with the 1 square degree 90prime camera in 2006 may , 2007 september and 2008 may .",
    "this mosaic camera has 4 blue sensitive 4096x2096 ccds . counting cosmetic defects and the plate scale of 0.45  per pixel we had an effective field of view of approximately 1.02 square degrees .",
    "the ccds are arranged in a square with intra - ccd gaps of about 10 arcminutes .",
    "we used a johnson u , b , v + cousins - kron r filter set for the observations .",
    "this field of view was ideal for the project as it allowed each of the project fields to be observed in a single pointing .",
    "program fields were observed twice in each filter with exposure times of 600 seconds in u , 480 seconds in b , and 90 seconds each in v and r. exposure times were chosen to reach a limiting magnitude of 20th in u and 22nd in b , v and r. these exposures were of sufficient length to require autoguiding .",
    "the filters were not parfocal but focus was digital and corrections were easily applied .",
    "we reduced the data with the iraf _ mscred mosaic image reduction package @xcite .",
    "the data were corrected for cross talk , bias , and dark current .",
    "flatfielding was done using night - sky flats from program fields supplemented by a series of random sky exposure with equivalent exposure times .",
    "ccd defects , bad pixels and satellite trails were removed .",
    "_    astrometry was done with larsen s mosaf ( mosaic astrometry finder ) program written for the spacewatch 0.9 meter telescope @xcite which uses a 13 term polynomial for a plate model , the cfitsio library @xcite and wcslib from wcstools @xcite .",
    "the astrometric reference catalog was usno - b1.0 @xcite , and the residuals were approximately 0.3   in all frames .",
    "photometric reductions used both landolt standards @xcite and a secondary set of faint standards from @xcite , and followed the method of @xcite .",
    "the formal zero point errors were approximately 0.03 magnitudes per filter with the photometric rms of 0.05 magnitudes per band .",
    "an example of the mean atmospheric extinction and color terms can be found in table  [ tbl-5 ] ; seeing varied from 1.0   to 2.8   during the 2006 may observations .",
    "fields which could not be reached with the bok 2.3 meter telescope were observed using the y4kcam at the 1.0 meter smarts consortium telescope at ctio in 2006 april and 2008 october .",
    "this camera is a 4096x4096 pixel single ccd with a plate scale of 0.289 \" per pixel and a field of view of about 0.108 square degrees .",
    "consequently , 9 subfields were observed to yield an effective area of @xmath17 0.95 square degrees with overlap .",
    "the johnson u , b , v + cousins - kron r filter set was used for these observations .",
    "program fields were observed once in each filter . during 2006 april , the exposure times were 300s in u , 150s in b , and 60s in the v and r bands .",
    "this was sufficient to reach 19th magnitude in b. v and r and 18th magnitude in u. in 2008 october , the exposure times were increased to 400s in u , 485s in b , 160s in v and 190s in r to reach fainter magnitudes .",
    "these exposures were of sufficient length to require autoguiding .",
    "the filters were not parfocal but could be compensated by a focus reduction .",
    "our initial processing of the frames was based on the iraf scripts for the y4kcam provided by massey .",
    "flat fielding used both dome and twilight flats .",
    "astrometry was done using wcstools and the usno - b1.0 catalog with results refined and checked against mosaf .",
    "seeing was moderate for the 2006 april observations , with fwhm from 1.5   to 3.0  .",
    "photometric reductions used both landolt standards @xcite and a secondary set of faint standards from @xcite .",
    "photometric magnitudes were then determined using the same method as the 90prime data to assure consistency .",
    "examples of the mean atmospheric extinction and color terms are in table  [ tbl-6 ] .",
    "source detection , image parametrization and catalog creation used source extractor .",
    "after several tests to verify that we were detecting objects close to the image limits , the default size for the gaussian convolution mask was used and magnitudes were determined using the mag_auto feature which uses an adaptive aperture photometry routine .",
    "aperture photometry was performed on the detected objects . since most are stars , they were not subject to the same faint - end systematics as galaxies @xcite .",
    "we also discarded all objects detected within 4   of the edge of the frame as potentially truncated .",
    "a custom pipeline was written to apply the wcs astrometry solution and photometric calibration to each object in the catalogs for each field .",
    "we then used the wcs positions to match the objects observed in the different filters . to be included in the final catalog , each object had to be measured in at least two filters to provide color information .",
    "problems with the star - galaxy classifier in source extractor are discussed in the next section .",
    "the final catalogs with magnitudes , positions , colors and object classifications will be available on - line with the second paper .",
    "the neural network classifier in source extractor does not work on images with pixel scales similar to those in our data .",
    "we therefore developed our own simple classifier , called jal , based on image parameters from source extractor sensitive to the differences between point sources and extended objects .",
    "we conducted a series of tests of the various image parameters to find three that were suitable for a simple parameter space cut which could be applied to each image .",
    "the following three parameter space comparisons were adopted :    1 .",
    "* mu_max vs. isoarea_image captures the tendency of extended objects to have a surface brightness much lower than a star at the same isophotal diameter .",
    "a sample parameter space is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] , with the discriminator curve separating stars from galaxies . * 2 .",
    "* mag_iso vs. mag_aper isolates the tendency of extended objects to have a substantial fraction of its light outside of the core of the psf , generating an isophotal magnitude larger than the aperture magnitude .",
    "an example of this parameter space is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] , with the discriminator curve separating stars from galaxies . *",
    "* xy_image vs. mu_max shows how an extended object tends to have a moment in the intensity distribution much different than a star at the same peak surface brightness . the sample parameter space for these parameters is shown in figure  [ fig4 ] , with the discriminator curve separating stars from galaxies .",
    "this is the weakest of the three criteria and is therefore given one - half the weight of the other tests . *",
    "we used these three discriminators in a simple perl / pgplot routine which allowed the user to interactively define a curve separating stars ( scored as 0 ) from galaxies ( scored as 1 ) .",
    "the net classification for a given image was a weighted score of 0 to 1 averaged from the three tests . during the final catalog matching an averaged net score",
    "was then computed from the v and r bands only .",
    "we conservatively considered an object with a average score greater than 0.3 to be a galaxy .",
    "we developed this method by comparison with other classifiers .",
    "training and fine - tuning the parameter spaces was done using stars and galaxies classified with focas in the osmer and hall standard fields observed each night . as a final test , we chose a 90prime field ( h055 + 42 ) in the maps catalog of the poss i with object classification using a neural network @xcite which was also observed and classified by sdss .",
    "the results of our comparison as a function of magnitude are in tables  [ tbl-1 ] and  [ tbl-2 ] for the maps and sdss , respectively . for @xmath18 ,",
    "our classifier agreed with the aps classification 89% of the time or better and with sdss 95% of the time or better .",
    "the lower agreement with the maps can be attributed to blended images on the maps scans which were classified as non - stellar or galaxies .",
    "the poor agreement with both aps and sdss for @xmath19 is easily explained by the onset of saturation in the 90prime images for our exposure times .",
    "six of our program fields overlap sdss .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows a photometry comparison between objects classified as stars by both sdss and our classifier for the program field h055 + 42 .",
    "the sdss stars have been transformed to the standard v band @xcite . for this comparison",
    "we find a zero point difference of 0.02 magnitudes .",
    "for @xmath20 the rms difference between sdss magnitudes and ours is 0.04 magnitudes , for @xmath21 the deviation is 0.09 magnitude and for @xmath22 it is 0.31 magnitude . our data is thus well - suited for our star count analysis down to @xmath23 .",
    "our magnitudes and colors were corrected for interstellar extinction using the maps from @xcite and the standard interstellar extinction law @xcite .",
    "each star was corrected based on its coordinates using the interpolation routines provided .",
    "this approach assumes that the extinction comes from relatively near the sun and is applied as a constant correction . because our fields are intermediate to high galactic latitudes , extinction is relatively low .",
    "all but two fields have an average @xmath24 of less than 0.08 .",
    "one high extinction field ( h300 - 20 ) has an average @xmath24 of 0.36 .",
    "the extinction - corrected color - magnitude diagram resembled the other fields with the placement of the blue ridge at the expected @xmath25 color .",
    "therefore extinction anomalies do not play a role in our evaluation of the star counts .",
    "the classical estimate of the completeness limit is determined from a plot of the log of the cumulative star counts vs. magnitude and determining the magnitude at which it deviates from the expected straight power law . for galactic structure work at the magnitudes we are considering however",
    ", this classical method does not work well because the density of thick disk stars changes with distance above the plane of the galaxy . at fainter magnitudes",
    "there are simply fewer stars to be found at larger distances which can look like incompleteness .    to derive our completeness estimates we therefore adopt a model - based estimate of completeness using larsen s galactic model program galmod @xcite . in figure  [ fig6 ]",
    "we show the results of a completeness estimate for field h300 - 20 using a classical power law compared with one using the galactic model . while the power law deviates by more than 10% from the observed cumulative counts as bright as @xmath26 , the model based estimate shows that due to the decreasing density of stars along the line of sight the completeness limit of the field is closer to @xmath27 .",
    "we use the model - based completeness estimate for the rest of our analysis .",
    "our completeness limits are tabulated in table  [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "if the completeness limit appears fainter than @xmath28 , it is reported as being 21.0 . in general ,",
    "due to their brighter limiting magnitudes , our ctio fields are not as complete as the fields observed with the bok telescope .",
    "the fields used to test for triaxiality are circled on figure  [ fig1 ] and listed in table  [ tbl-3 ] . for this initial analysis",
    "we use @xmath29 and the @xmath25 color only .",
    "a sample color - magnitude diagram for one of our fields is shown in figure  [ fig7 ] .    to isolate the faint blue stars in the thick disk / inner halo which show the stellar excess",
    ", we use the easily recognized `` blue ridge '' which identifies the locus of the main sequence stars in each field . the green lines in figure  [ fig7 ]",
    "delineate this magnitude range over which all of the y4kcam and 90prime fields are complete . at these magnitudes ,",
    "a well - defined peak in the number of stars is apparent near @xmath30 , the blue ridge , as illustrated in the color histogram in figure  [ fig8 ] .",
    "as we have discussed in previous papers @xcite , the galmod model shows that bluewards of this peak , we isolate a sample of inner halo and thick disk stars in the magnitude range @xmath31 . assuming that these are main sequence subdwarfs , these stars will be between 1 and 5 kpc from the sun .",
    "we define the peak of the blue ridge , @xmath32 , as the median color of the stars within @xmath16 0.4 dex of the maximum color bin , see figure  [ fig8 ] .",
    "the resulting blue ridge peak colors are included in table  [ tbl-3 ] . with the magnitude and color range thus defined",
    ", we also give the area of each field , the estimated completeness limit @xmath33 , and the number of stars bluer than @xmath32 in the magnitude ranges @xmath31 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "we then determined the star count ratios for the paired fields in q1 and q4 normalizing for the area of the field .",
    "the ratios for each magnitude range are summarized in table  [ tbl-4 ] with their error and the significance parameter , _ s _ computed as per @xcite .",
    "the predicted ratios from galmod are also included .",
    "galmod ratios were required for all comparisons which involved fields above and below the plane because the sun is not in the mid - plane of the disk but instead lies slightly above it @xcite",
    ". ratios of fields above the plane compared to fields below the plane should be slightly less than one due to this geometry and the sun s location in the northern galactic hemisphere .",
    "comparisons between lines of sight in the same galactic hemisphere should have a ratio near unity if the stellar distribution in the galaxy is symmetric .",
    "there are four comparisons in table  [ tbl-4 ] : q1 and q4 fields above the plane , q1 and q4 fields below the plane , q1 fields above with those below the plane , and the q4 fields above and below the plane .",
    "we find a statistically significant excess in the ratios for the q1 to q4 fields above the plane for the two fields at the lowest longitudes , _",
    "l _ of 45@xmath15 and 50@xmath15 that are an extension of the hercules thick disk cloud asymmetry .",
    "the fields at the greater longitudes , _",
    "l _ of 55@xmath15 , 60@xmath15 , 65@xmath15 and 75@xmath15 show no trend of systematic deviations from a ratio of 1.0 . for q1 above and below the plane , there is a small excess above the plane in the two lowest longitude fields that does not extend to higher longitudes .",
    "we do not find evidence for an excess when comparing q1 to q4 below the plane or when comparing the q4 fields above and below the plane .",
    "a few deviations from the expected ratios exist in isolated directions / magnitude bins and are of interest , but they do not show a systematic trend .",
    "our star count ratios summarized in table  [ tbl-4 ] show a small excess of faint blue stars at _ l _ of 45@xmath15 and 50@xmath15 but not at the greater longitudes including the faintest magnitude intervals .",
    "these results support parker et al s ( 2003 ) conclusion that the asymmetry feature in q1 extends to about 55@xmath15 .",
    "we thus find _ no evidence that the hercules thick disk cloud and the star count excess is due to a triaxial thick disk . _ the ratios at _ l _ of 45@xmath15 and 50@xmath15 return to 1.0 at the faintest magnitude bin ( @xmath36 ) , suggesting that we may be seeing through the asymmetry feature ; a possible clue to its extent along our line of sight in this direction . at @xmath37",
    "however , these faint blue stars will be about 2 kpc above the plane , and may not be in the thick disk .",
    "we also note that the above vs. below the plane ratios in q1 and q4 and the q1/q4 ratio below the plane are consistent with the predictions of the galactic model .",
    "there is no star count excess .",
    "this is not in agreement with @xcite who concluded that the excess exists both above and below the plane .",
    "this may be evidence that the hercules thick disk cloud is actually a debris stream .",
    "however , considering the small number of field pairs and the fact that we are apparently at the edge of the cloud at these longitudes , we consider this a tentative result pending the analysis of the full set of fields .",
    "paper ii will include an analysis of the full dataset , mapping the stellar excess in galactic longitude and latitude and along the line of sight to determine the full extent of the cloud .",
    "our third paper will include the spectroscopy and analysis of the kinematics of the stars showing the excess .",
