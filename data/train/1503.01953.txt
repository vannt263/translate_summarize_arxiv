    "the refractive index change at a given point is determined not only by the light intensity at that point but also by the light intensity near that point , which can be described by a nonlocal response function .",
    "there are several types of nonlocal response in real nonlinear media , such as the zeroth - order modified bessel nonlocal response in nematic liquid crystals @xcite , the logarithmic nonlocal response in lead glass @xcite , and the exponential - decay type nonlocal response in aqueous solution of rhodamine b @xcite and diluted india ink @xcite .",
    "all these response functions are integrable functions with non - negative value .",
    "nikolov _ et al .",
    "_ found that quadratic solitons are equivalent to nonlocal solitons on the basis of an analogy between parametric interaction and diffusive nonlocality @xcite .",
    "the nonlocal analogy was later used to successfully describe pulse compression @xcite , localized x waves @xcite , and modulational instability @xcite in @xmath2 materials .",
    "_ showed that the second harmonic ( sh ) , like the nonlinear refractive index forming a waveguide , traps the fundamental wave ( fw ) .",
    "they found two types of response functions , the exponential - decay type and the sine - oscillatory type . on the basis of the sine - oscillatory type response function",

    "_ further investigated quadratic solitons with a sine - oscillatory type response function and found a family of analytical solutions under the strongly nonlocal approximation @xcite .",
    "however , these soliton solutions , whether numerical or analytical , were all unstable . we have shown that boundary conditions can stabilize this type of nonlocal soliton with sine - oscillatory response functions @xcite . in this letter , we will demonstrate that nematic liquid crystal with negative dielectric anisotropy is new media which has oscillatory response functions .",
