    "the census of baryons in the local universe @xcite indicates that a substantial fraction of the baryonic density predicted by primordial nucleosynthesis remains to be detected . numerical simulations ( @xcite )",
    "predict that a large fraction of this is in the form of a moderately warm / hot ( @xmath2 k ) component ( warm - hot intergalactic medium , or whim ) .",
    "the whim is hard to detect directly both because of the difficulty in uv observations as well as due to its relatively low intrinsic density .",
    "a promising direction is to look for its signature in absorption lines from background quasars ( see @xcite ) .",
    "recently , a number of groups have reported detecting the li - like resonance doublet in far - uv qso spectra at @xmath3 ( @xcite , rbh01 ) .",
    "@xcite also detected an absorber at @xmath4 without any or absorption , indicating that it was either collisionally ionized with a temperature @xmath5 or photo - ionized with a low density .",
    "@xcite report an absorption system at @xmath6 , possibly associated with a galaxy group and @xcite describe five absorbers in the range @xmath7 . adopting reasonable assumptions , these authors argued that the total number of baryons associated with these absorbers was significant , comparable to the combined mass in stars , cool gas and cluster gas .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the connection between these two ideas in more detail .",
    "in particular , we posit that the absorption arises , in large part , in collisionally ionized gas that resides in the sheets , filaments and low density clumps that are naturally produced by gravitational collapse in hierarchical cosmology .",
    "the gas is shock - heated to a range of temperatures , while is only significantly produced in a relatively narrow range around @xmath8 k. this is near the peak of the cooling curve ( e.g. @xcite ) and so places a constraint on the density if the gas is not to cool in the hubble timescale . for gas with @xmath9 solar metallicity at @xmath8",
    "k , the density must be less than @xmath10 @xmath11 . assuming an ionization fraction of 0.15 , this requires a path length of 100 kpc to generate a column density of @xmath12 , typical of observed values . while this is a relatively large path length , the hubble expansion if undisturbed would be only @xmath13 , which is well within the observed line widths .",
    "therefore , we expect that thermal broadening should dominate and @xmath14 for most lines .",
    "as we will show ; however , colder , photoionized gas can also give rise to absorption .",
    "for these lines , which tend to have lower column densities , the predicted line width is considerably smaller .",
    "very recently , a preprint by @xcite has appeared which examines this issue using different simulation techniques ; where there is overlap , our results agree reasonably well .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we describe the hydrodynamic simulation and how we synthesis the simulated spectra .",
    "section  3 discusses the results and section  3 summarizes our main conclusions .",
    "we use numerical simulations to generate predictions for the observed distribution . in particular",
    ", we use a grid - based adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) method ( @xcite ) that provides both good shock capturing as well as relatively high resolution in dense regions .",
    "we simulate a cube 20 @xmath15 mpc on a side with gas and dark matter mass resolution of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . the smallest grid cell ( i.e. the best resolution )",
    "is 9.8 kpc and occurs in the densest regions .",
    "we assume a cosmological model with a matter density @xmath18 , baryon density @xmath19 , hubble constant @xmath20 ( in units of @xmath21 ) and cosmological constant @xmath22 .",
    "the initial density field is drawn from an adiabatic cdm power spectrum as approximated by the formula of @xcite .",
    "we include dark matter and gravity but not radiative cooling or energy / metal injection from sn - driven galactic winds . by comparing a set of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations ,",
    "@xcite concluded that radiative cooling play a minor role in the evolution of whim gas at @xmath23 due to its low density .",
    "however , these processes can play an important role in metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "for instance , _ fuse _ has detected absorption in the galactic wind from the prototypical dwarf galaxies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . since we do not know the distribution of oxygen a priori in this simulation",
    ", we adopt a density dependent metallicity model as derived in the simulations of @xcite . while this is reasonable",
    ", we plan to revisit this issue in a future paper using a simulation which self - consistently includes both radiative cooling and metal / energy injection .    to analyze the results , we generate artificial spectra as described in @xcite and @xcite , both for the 1032 @xmath24 line and the 1216 @xmath24 hi",
    "ly@xmath25 line . to compute the @xmath26 and @xmath27 fractions , we adopt two models to investigate the effect of collisional ionization and photo - ionization mechanisms . in model",
    "a , we use collisional ionization only , with ionization fractions from @xcite . in model b , we use cloudy ( version 90.04 ; @xcite ) to generate a grid of temperatures ( @xmath28 k ) and densities ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we included a background radiation field as computed by @xcite at @xmath30 due to the observed quasar distribution .",
    "we adopt a mean specific intensity at the lyman limit of @xmath31 .",
    "since the simulation did not include radiative heating / cooling , the unshocked igm gas has a temperature which is unrealistically low . for these low temperature ( and generally low density ) regions ,",
    "we adopt the relation between temperature and density that has been found in simulations of the ly@xmath25 forest : @xmath32 where @xmath33 k , and @xmath34 ( see , e.g. , @xcite for observational support ) . here",
    "overdensity @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the mean baryon density of the universe . to fit the simulated spectra we adopt the method developed by @xcite , which should work well for these relatively isolated lines .",
    "figure  1 displays the projected baryon overdensity ( panel a ) , column density ( panel b , based on model b ) , temperature ( @xmath37 k in panel c ; @xmath38 k in panel d ) . comparing panel b with panel a",
    ", we find that most of the high column density lines come from regions with overdensities of @xmath1 .",
    "collisional ionization is dominant in many of these regions , given their temperatures in the range @xmath38 k ( panel d ) , but some systems are clearly photo - ionized , particularly at the low density end .",
    "note that big clusters and groups are too hot to produce .    in figure",
    "2 we show the properties of the simulated region along one random line - of - sight ( los ) . from top to bottom",
    "we display the baryon number density , peculiar velocity , temperature , number density and transmission spectrum ( @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the optical depth ) for in model a ( solid line ) , model b ( dashed line ) and for ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "model b has been shifted by @xmath41 for visual clarity .",
    "note that at high densities and warm temperatures , both models agree well , while for low temperature regions , model b ( which includes both photo- and collisional - ionization ) , produces substantially more .",
    "figure  2e shows that both models generate a strong absorption line at around @xmath42 along this los .",
    "notice that no strong peak appears in the @xmath43 and @xmath44 distributions at the corresponding redshift .",
    "this absorption line is actually produced by the @xmath44 peak at @xmath45 .",
    "it is the peculiar velocity which shifts the line to a lower redshift : a peculiar velocity of @xmath46 corresponds to a shift of @xmath47 .",
    "parenthetically , we note that this means the total number of lines may be underestimated because the peculiar velocities can shift lines out of the simulated regions ; however , we estimate that this would only change our predicted number density by about @xmath9 . fitting the observed line in figure",
    "2e gives an equivalent width ( ew ) of @xmath48 and a doppler @xmath49-parameter of @xmath50 , which is roughly consistent with thermal broadening ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the atomic mass number ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that a broad , hot ly@xmath25 component may coexist with the absorbers and such a broad component could be easy to miss with current observations . to demonstrate this",
    ", they showed that a fit to the multicomponent lya profile including a broad component ( due to coexisting with the in hot gas ) is indistinguishable from a fit which does not contain such a broad component , at the signal - to - noise level of their data . in figure  2e",
    "we display the ly@xmath25 spectrum ( the dot - dashed line ) from our simulation .",
    "a broad component is clearly identified at the position of the strongest absorption line .",
    "spectral fitting shows this line has a column density of @xmath53 and a doppler @xmath49-parameter of @xmath54 .",
    "both parameters are consistent with those from the missing ly@xmath25 absorption line in @xcite .",
    "the doppler @xmath49-paramter is also consistent with thermal broadening by a hot gas of @xmath55 k. line , a relatively broaden component appears with @xmath56 in the @xmath57 absorption systems . ]    by applying the spectral fit procedure to a total of @xmath58 los we obtain the cumulative number per unit redshift ( @xmath59 ) as a function of equivalent width .",
    "figure  3 displays the @xmath59 for both models .",
    "we also plot two observational results from @xcite for pg 0953 + 415 and @xcite for e  1821 + 643 .",
    "in general we find that the simulation and observations agree reasonably well .",
    "we notice that for @xmath60 , the absorption line number per unit redshift from model b is less than twice the line number from model a. this implies that above @xmath61 the lines from collisionally ionized gas begin to outnumber lines from photo - ionized gas . at @xmath62 ,",
    "both models give consistent distributions .",
    "this means that those strong lines come from high density and high temperature regions , where collisional ionization dominates . for @xmath63 , lines from photo - ionized gas outnumber lines from collisionally ionized gas , implying that lines produced by photo - ionized gas contribute significantly for low strength lines . due to our simulation resolution lines with @xmath64 could be underestimated .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite we estimate that at @xmath60 where collisional ionization dominates , the gas probed by absorption lines is about @xmath9 of the total baryonic matter .",
    "this means that the absorption lines can actually probe about @xmath65 of the whim gas , since the fraction of the baryons predicted to be in the whim gas is about one third of the total baryonic matter @xcite .",
    "the remaining @xmath66 whim gas is likely to be too hot to be detected via absorption : @xcite predicted that at @xmath30 the baryon fraction peaks at around @xmath67 k , in which or should be dominated .",
    "our result is consistent with what @xcite find in their simulations , especially in that they find at @xmath68 lines from collisionally ionized gas outnumber lines from photo - ionized gas .",
    "however , overall we predict more absorption lines .",
    "we find the doppler @xmath49 parameter of the absorption line can provide important clues in distinguishing photo- and collisional - ionization . by fitting the spectra ,",
    "the doppler @xmath49 parameters are obtained for all the absorption lines .",
    "we find that the distribution of the line widths is well approximated by a log - normal : @xmath69 $ ] . in figure  4 , we plot @xmath70 against equivalent width cutoff for our two models . in the collisional ionization case ( model a )",
    ", the distribution is nearly constant with @xmath71 . on the other hand ,",
    "when we include a photo - ionizing background ( model b ) , the distribution depends on the strength of the line . for lines with @xmath72 ,",
    "the value of @xmath70 is still around 20 km / s , but drops quickly for smaller lines .",
    "this reflects the fact that more photo - ionized lines contribute for @xmath73 .",
    "a statistically complete sample does not yet exist to compare against these predictions .",
    "recently @xcite compiled the first batch of @xmath74 absorption lines detected in a total of five quasars .",
    "they found that the majority of the lines have @xmath49-values of @xmath75 , implying a collisional - ionization origin .",
    "if this result continues to hold for low equivalent width lines , it may be telling us something either about the strength of the photoionizing background or the metallicity of the low - temperature filaments .",
    "either case ( lower background or lower metallicity in the cold gas ) , would produce fewer photo - ionized lines relative to collisionally ionized .",
    "in this _ letter _ we have studied the properties of absorption lines via hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows .    1 .",
    "the projected number density distribution shows that the majority of absorption comes from filaments that connect virialized intersections or groups of galaxies .",
    "these regions typically have an overdensity of @xmath76 .",
    "spectral fits show that collisional ionization dominates in high density , high temperature regions , while photo - ionization dominates in low density , low temperature regions .",
    "3 .   the predicted cumulative distribution of absorption lines fits the observations remarkably well , given the uncertainties due to limited resolution and the assumed metallicity distribution . at @xmath60 absorption lines produced by collisionally ionized gas start to outnumber lines produced by photo - ionized gas , while at @xmath62 essentially all the absorption lines are produced by collisionally ionized gas .",
    "we find that the absorption lines produced by collisionally ionized gas have a characteristic doppler @xmath49 parameter of @xmath77 , and lines due to the photo - ionized gas typically have narrower @xmath49-parameters .",
