    "due to its importance as a base material for the fabrication of optoelectronic devices in the blue and ultraviolet spectral region , gan has been extensively studied in recent years .",
    "the comprehensive study of material and device properties@xcite has recently been complemented by an increasing number of studies concerning surface structures@xcite and associated growth mechanisms , in particular for growth by plasma - assisted molecular - beam epitaxy ( pambe ) on the ga - polar ( 0001 ) surface.@xcite    one of the fundamental results of these studies is that gan growth by pambe ought to be carried out under ga - rich conditions in order to obtain a smooth surface morphology and optimized material properties . at low growth temperatures",
    ", however , this leads to ga accumulation and droplet formation , which is detrimental to the gan epilayer quality.@xcite as a consequence , it was thought that optimum gan growth conditions must be as close as possible to ga / n stoichiometry .",
    "it has been recently observed that such ga accumulation can be prevented when growing gan at high temperatures and small ga excess fluxes.@xcite in particular , it has been shown that , at high growth temperatures , a wide range of ga fluxes exists , for which a finite amount of excess ga is present on the gan surface whose quantity is independent of the value of the ga flux.@xcite such conditions may provide a `` growth window '' for gan pambe , i.e. a region , where the growth mechanisms and the surface morphology are independent of fluctuations of ga flux and growth temperature.@xcite    however , the quantitative description of a gan `` growth diagram '' , which describes the ga surface coverage during growth as a function of ga flux and growth temperature , has not yet been achieved : the results on the temperature dependence of the critical excess ga flux at the onset of ga droplet formation are contradictory , yielding activation energies of 2.8ev ( ref .  ) and 4.8ev ( ref .  ) , respectively .",
    "this suggests that the underlying mechanisms of ga accumulation are not yet understood .    to address this discrepancy ,",
    "we have performed ga adsorption measurements on ( 0001 ) gan .",
    "we discuss the results in the framework of a lattice - gas growth model for adsorption , which is based on _ ab initio _ calculated parameters .",
    "this model explains the origin of the apparently contradicting parameters derived from previous experimental studies@xcite and gives a consistent description .",
    "the adsorption experiments were performed in a meca2000 molecular - beam epitaxy chamber equipped with a standard effusion cell for ga evaporation .",
    "the chamber also contains a rf plasma cell to provide active nitrogen for gan growth .",
    "the pseudo - substrates used were 2@xmath1 m thick ( 0001 ) ( ga - polarity ) gan layers grown by mocvd on sapphire .",
    "the substrate temperature @xmath2 was measured by a thermocouple in mechanical contact to the backside of the molybdenum sample holder and shielded from direct heating .",
    "prior to all experiments , a 100 nm thick gan layer was grown under ga - rich conditions on the pseudosubstrates to remove the influence of a possible surface contamination layer .",
    "ga fluxes @xmath3 have been calibrated to ga effusion cell temperatures by reflection high - energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) intensity oscillations during n - rich gan growth at a substrate temperature of @xmath4@xmath5c . in these conditions , the growth rate is actually proportional to the impinging ga flux .",
    "it is sound to assume that the ga adatom sticking coefficient is unity at such a low substrate temperature , which permits an absolute calibration of the ga flux _ in terms of the gan surface site density_.    the ga surface coverage was assessed by analyzing the specularly - reflected rheed intensity by a method described in refs .   and .",
    "this method uses the oscillatory transients in specular rheed intensity , which are observed during ga adsorption and desorption on / from ( 0001 ) gan surfaces .",
    "it has been shown that the duration of these transients can be qualitatively related to the amount of adsorbing or desorbing ga.@xcite in general , the relation between intensity and ga coverage is unknown .",
    "although tempting , the interpretation of these electron reflectivity transients in terms of rheed oscillations is not obvious .",
    "furthermore , it must been noted that the shape of the transients ( albeit not their duration ) depends on the diffraction conditions , notably the incidence angle . of course , the modeling of electron reflection would allow to directly relate the rheed intensity to the ga coverage ( and the surface structure ) but this is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "however , the total duration of the transients occurring during ga desorption can be used to qualitatively estimate the amount of ga adsorbed on the surface . in ref .",
    ", an indirect method has been used to draw limited _ quantitative _ information from the desorption transients ; below we will demonstrate a fully quantitative calibration relating the ga desorption transient time to absolute ga surface coverages .",
    "this allows us to circumvent the problem that the rheed intensity can not in general be easily related to adatom coverage .",
    "the experimental procedure is thus as follows : to assess the ga quantity present after ga adsorption for different impinging ga fluxes , the ga flux has been interrupted after a fixed adsorption time . the subsequent variation of the specular rheed intensity due to ga evaporation under vacuum has been recorded .",
    "specular rheed intensity during ga desorption from a ( 0001 ) gan surface .",
    "beforehand , ga adsorption has been carried out at ga fluxes @xmath3 as indicated . for @xmath6ml / s ,",
    "the desorption transients correspond to equilibrium adsorption , i.e. they do not change as a function of the previous adsorption time . for @xmath7ml",

    "is close to the cohesive energy of bulk ga and has thus been directly interpreted as a ga desorption barrier , what is the physical origin of the 5.1ev activation energy and the meaning of a prefactor of 10@xmath48hz ?",
    "the latter value is fundamentally different from prefactors typically observed / calculated for diffusion or desorption processes ( which are of the order of @xmath49hz ) .      to address the above questions ,",

    "second , we calculate the critical adatom density , at which nucleation occurs and the system undergoes a phase transition .    the adatom coverage is given by :    @xmath53    here , the desorption time @xmath54 is given by    @xmath55    with @xmath56 the desorption barrier and @xmath57 the boltzmann constant .",

    "( [ eq : drhodta ] ) also simplifies : @xmath65 , i.e. the left hand side becomes zero . a further simplification in eq .",
    "( [ eq : drhodta ] ) can be made by taking into account that the phase transitions we are interested in occur exclusively under ga - rich conditions . under these conditions",
    "the surface steps on the surface are ga - terminated@xcite and the incorporation rate @xmath66 at such a step will be small .",
    "this is in contrast to the conventional step flow picture where the sticking probability of an atom at the step edge is assumed to be close to one .",
    "the difference to the conventional model is due to the fact that we have two species with very different concentrations . for nitrogen ( which is the minority species for very ga - rich conditions )",
    "the sticking coefficient at the ga - terminated step edges will be close to one and steps act as sinks to the nitrogen concentration which becomes highly inhomegenous . for ga atoms ,",

    "thus , the effect of steps on ga will be small and the ga - adatom density is virtually homogeneous , i.e. @xmath67 .    based on the above discussion , eq .",

    "[ tab : fitresults ] .",
    "the good agreement with the experimental prefactors @xmath126 shows that the model consistently describes all previous experimental studies .",
    "the large variation in frequencies and activation energies can be explained by assuming that the n flux affects the temperature dependence : it is largest if no n flux is present and monotonously decreases with increasing n flux ( growth rate ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that , although the temperature dependence has a huge effect on the experimentally measured apparent activation barrier @xmath127 ( by almost a factor of two ) and prefactor @xmath126 ( by up to 12 orders of magnitude ) , the actual change in the effective desorption energy @xmath114 is small : in the case of adsorption ( @xmath128 ) , the activation barrier changes from 2.84ev to 2.73ev within the experimentally measured temperature window ( 700@xmath5c to 750@xmath5c ) . in the case of gan growth ,",
    "the variation is even smaller .",
    "this can be intuitively understood by considering that the experimentally measured activation energy represents a linear projection to zero temperature even when its real temperature dependence deviates strongly from linear behavior outside our experimental temperature window .",
    "based on a combination of experimental rheed studies and first - principle growth models we have ( i ) quantitatively determined the ga coverage on the gan ( 0001 ) surface during adsorption as a function of ga flux and substrate temperature and ( ii ) derived a model , which consistently describes the adsorption of ga on gan surfaces as well as the accumulation of ga during ga - rich gan growth .",
    "this model resolves the discrepancy in previous measurements of the activation energy characterizing the critical ga flux for the onset of ga droplet fromation during gan growth.@xcite    the model also explains the origin of the experimentally - observed unphysically high prefactors in terms of a temperature dependent desorption barrier . at the moment , we can only speculate about possible mechanisms which reduce the activation barrier at higher temperatures .",
    "a possible scenario emerges from our first principles calculations where we find that the number of atoms in the compressed ga layer of the bilayer structure and thus the lateral lattice constant of the top ga layer significantly changes with temperature .",
    "this change in the surface geometry is expected to have an important effect on the island formation energy and will be discussed in a forthcoming paper.@xcite    the authors would like to thank o. briot ( university of montpellier , france ) for providing the gan templates and f. rieutord ( cea grenoble , drfmc / si3 m ) for valuable discussions .",
