    "in recent years lattice qcd calculations have demonstrated remarkable progress in computing hadron properties from first principles . in particular , hadron structure has been a major focus of the lattice qcd community .",
    "recently the nucleon axial coupling @xmath4 has been computed  @xcite with good precision and has been shown to be in agreement with the very well known experimental result within the systematic and statistical errors of the calculation .",
    "the success of such calculations motivates us to study the axial couplings for all the octet baryons .",
    "the experimental knowledge of such couplings is not as good as in the case of @xmath4 and in certain cases , such as the axial couplings @xmath5 and @xmath6 , their values are not known experimentally , and theoretical estimates are rather imprecise .",
    "the hyperon axial couplings are important parameters entering the low - energy effective field theory description of the octet baryons . at the leading order of su(3 )",
    "heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory , these coupling constants are linear combinations of the universal coupling constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which enter the chiral expansion of every baryonic quantity , including masses and scattering lengths .",
    "these coupling constants are needed in the effective field theory description of both the non - leptonic decays of hyperons , and the hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon scattering phase shifts  @xcite .",
    "hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon interactions are essential in understanding the physics of neutron stars where hyperon and kaon production may soften the equation of state of dense hadronic matter .    studying the octet baryon axial couplings on the lattice",
    "is no more complicated than computing the nucleon axial coupling @xmath4 .",
    "the lack of experimental information in cases such as @xmath5 and @xmath6 gives us the opportunity to make predictions using lattice qcd .",
    "previously , there have been two attempts to determine these coupling constants using different theoretical approaches : chiral perturbation theory  @xcite and the large-@xmath9 limit  @xcite .",
    "m.  j.  savage et  al .",
    "@xcite use chiral perturbation theory to work out the one - loop corrections due to su(3 ) symmetry breaking , and predict @xmath10 .",

    "@xcite and flores - mendieta et  al .",
    "@xcite predict a range of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "both approaches give very loose bounds on the values of these coupling constants ; hence , a lattice qcd calculation has the opportunity to make a substantial improvement .",
    "lattice qcd calculations can now provide much more stringent theoretical estimates of these axial couplings .",
    "the various systematic errors that enter such calculations can be controlled , giving us the ability to compute the predictions of qcd very precisely .",
    "the systematic errors that we need to control are due to the finite lattice spacing , the finite volume and chiral extrapolations .",
    "lattice calculations are performed on a discrete space - time in a finite volume , using monte carlo integration to directly evaluate the path integral ; continuum physics is recovered by taking the lattice spacing to zero ( @xmath15 ) and the volume to infinity ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "in addition , using current computer resources , we can not yet calculate at the physical pion mass .",
    "using chiral perturbation theory and calculations at multiple heavier pion masses which are more affordable , we can extrapolate quantities of interest to the physical limit .",
    "such calculations also help to determine the low - energy constants of the chiral effective theory and allow us to study the quark - mass dependence of our observables .",

    "here we consider the next - best available option , which is continuum chiral perturbation theory .",

    ", we see that finite - volume corrections contribute at the order of @xmath46 or less for the parameters of our calculation .",
    "therefore , we will only implement the infinite - volume chiral perturbation theory and further simplify the formulation by taking @xmath47 . in these formulae",
    ", there are total eight parameters to be determined : three su(3 ) coupling constants ( @xmath48 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , and five other low energy constants ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) .",
    "we replace three mass splittings between the decuplet and octet with their lattice - measured values and replace @xmath54 and the chiral perturbation theory scale ( @xmath55 ) with the pseudoscalar decay constants calculated from the same lattice and actions ; a similar strategy was adopted by nplqcd and lhpc  @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that such an approach simplifies the mixed action chiral perturbation theory formulas  @xcite .",
    "we perform a simultaneous fit among multiple axial coupling constants without making further assumptions .",
    "we attempted to do simultaneous fitting among all three @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and found the @xmath56 for such a fit is of the order of @xmath57 .",
    "if we limit ourselves to the lightest three pion masses , we can reduce @xmath56 to the order of @xmath58 .",
    "although under certain plausible assumptions for the values of some low energy constants , the individual axial couplings can be fitted with reasonable @xmath56 , the combined fit seems to fail to describe the data .",
    "the conclusion we derive from this is that su(3 ) heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory fails to describe the lattice data .",
    "the pion and kaon masses used in our calculation are probably outside the range of validity of this order of the perturbative expansion .",
    "it is possible that such a unified description of the axial couplings requires the next order in chiral perturbation theory or smaller pion masses .",
    "however , since the physical strange quark mass is rather large , it seems that su(3 ) heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory might not be useful in helping extrapolate the lattice data to the physical point .",
    "here we should not forget that one of the reasons for our failure to fit with continuum heavy baryon su(3 ) chiral perturbation theory formulas could be discretization errors due to taste symmetry breaking in the sea sector .",
    "however , such errors should be small ; they are further suppressed to nlo in the expansion since the valence sector domain - wall fermions retain chiral symmetry .",
    "hence we do not expect that finite lattice spacing corrections will change our conclusion .",
    "since the continuum chiral extrapolation fails to describe our data , we take a step back and expand the axial couplings in terms of the su(3 ) breaking parameter @xmath59 as follows : @xmath60 this form reduces to the known su(3)-symmetric limit where the axial couplings are simple linear combinations of @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , not all the @xmath61 ( with @xmath62 ) are independent parameters . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : su3 ] we find that the constraint @xmath63 is preferred by the data .",
    "this suggests a 4-parameter fit to @xmath64 order or a 7-parameter fit to @xmath65 order if we ignore possible pion mass dependence of @xmath8 and @xmath7 . in order to have a reasonable fit form with the smallest number of parameters we will focus on the @xmath64 case .",
    "figure  [ fig : hyperonaxial ] shows our lattice data as a function of @xmath66 with the corresponding chiral extrapolation ; the band shows the jackknife uncertainty .    the @xmath56 is 0.83 and the linear fit parameters are very poorly determined as @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this is not surprising , since a small slope is seen in all three axial charges . at the physical pion point",
    ", we find the nucleon axial charge is @xmath69 ; this is is consistent with what lhpc obtained , 1.23(8 ) , from su(2 ) chiral perturbation extrapolation  @xcite . the extrapolated coupling constants @xmath5 and @xmath6 are @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively .",
    "these numbers are consistent with the existing predictions from chiral perturbation theory  @xcite and large-@xmath9 calculations but have much smaller errors .",
    "the low - energy chiral parameters are @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which are not consistent with the recent determination of @xmath74 and @xmath75 using semileptonic decay data and assuming su(3 ) symmetry  @xcite . however , the two calculations do agree within the range of the su(3 ) breaking effect we observed in the previous section .    since we know that the su(3 ) breaking in eq .",
    "[ eq : su3break ] is quadratic in @xmath37 , we expect that one needs to go at least to @xmath65 in order to capture this effect .",
    "hence , when taking the @xmath65 expansion , it is not surprising to see the @xmath56 improves to 0.57 .",
    "however , the coefficients @xmath76 remain poorly determined ( most of them are consistent with zero within the errorbar ) .",

    "however , it is hard to make an honest determination of such systematic error without further study at lighter pion masses and higher statistics .",
    "finally , one can consider that @xmath7 and @xmath8 have @xmath83 dependence as @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the chiral limit axial couplings .",
