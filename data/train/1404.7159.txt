    "the [ cii ] line in ly@xmath47 - 1 has a fwhm of only 56@xmath1211 , corresponding to @xmath84% of the width of its ly-@xmath47 line ( williams et al .",
    "this also corresponds to @xmath860% of the width of lbg-1a , i.e. , the narrowest component of lbg-1 . as discussed by carilli et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , it remains unclear if ly@xmath47 - 1 is a physically distinct system , or a local maximum in a tidal `` bridge '' connecting the massive , far - infrared - luminous galaxies . in any case ,",
    "based on the existing constraints , the properties of ly@xmath47 - 1 and lbg-1 appear to be quite dissimilar as well , but more detailed alma data on the br12020725 system will be required to further investigate possible similarities .",
    "it remains to be seen what role the environment plays in the evolution of lbg-1 . to address this issue in more detail",
    ", a first step will be a complete study of the aztec-3 protocluster with alma ( the current study only covered the center of the region ) and similar environments to be discovered in the future .",
    "equally importantly , sensitive studies of `` blank fields '' in the [ cii ] emission line will be necessary for an unbiased investigation of the [ cii ] luminosity function ( an approximate , but independent measure of the atomic gas content of galaxies through cosmic times ) , and to properly constrain the `` hidden '' , dust - obscured part of the star formation history of the universe through the detection of previously unknown faint , dusty star - forming galaxies .",
    "such c@xmath111 deep fields will be an important complement to similar studies in co and continuum emission alone ( studies of [ cii ] in continuum - preselected samples will only yield a biased view of this issue ; e.g. , swinbank et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    when alma is completed in the coming months",
    ", it will be an ideal tool for the most sensitive of these investigations . given the relative strength of the [ cii ] line , ccat will be able to detect [ cii ] emission over regions the size of the aztec-3 protocluster in a single shot using multi - object spectroscopy by the end of the decade .",
    "ultimately , ccat will also enable complementing , large - area c@xmath111 blank field studies that may cover regions as large as the full cosmos field to appreciable depth .",

    "<S> we report interferometric imaging of  and  emission toward the center of the galaxy protocluster associated with the @xmath0=5.3 submillimeter galaxy ( smg ) aztec-3 , using the atacama large ( sub)millimeter array ( alma ) . </S>",
    "<S> we detect strong [ cii ] , oh , and rest - frame 157.7@xmath1 m continuum emission toward the smg . the  emission is distributed over a scale of 3.9kpc , implying a dynamical mass of 9.7@xmath210@xmath3 , and a star formation rate ( sfr ) surface density of @xmath4=530yr@xmath5kpc@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that aztec-3 forms stars at @xmath7 approaching the eddington limit for radiation pressure supported disks . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the oh emission is slightly blueshifted relative to the [ cii ] line , which may indicate a molecular outflow associated with the peak phase of the starburst . </S>",
    "<S> we also detect and dynamically resolve emission over a scale of 7.5kpc toward a triplet of lyman - break galaxies with moderate uv - based sfrs in the protocluster at @xmath895kpc projected distance from the smg . </S>",
    "<S> these galaxies are not detected in the continuum , suggesting far - infrared sfrs of @xmath91854yr@xmath5 , consistent with a uv - based estimate of 22yr@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral energy distribution of these galaxies is inconsistent with nearby spiral and starburst galaxies , but resembles those of dwarf galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with expectations for young starbursts without significant older stellar populations . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that these galaxies are significantly metal - enriched , but not heavily dust - obscured , `` normal '' star - forming galaxies at @xmath0@xmath105 , showing that alma can detect the interstellar medium in `` typical '' galaxies in the very early universe . </S>"
