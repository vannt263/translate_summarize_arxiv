    "in this section we will analyze whether the ope potential is perturbative in the peripheral singlet waves , that is , the @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 partial waves .",
    "the approach is straightforward : we will compare the amplitudes that we obtain after the full iteration of ope with the perturbative ones .",
    "we will work out the phase shifts up to fourth order in perturbation theory .",
    "the outcome of these lengthy calculations is that the ope potential is definitely perturbative in all the singlet waves with orbital angular momentum @xmath31 ( the @xmath32 case will be dealt with in a separate manuscript ) .",
    "the interpretation in terms of traditional power counting is that the ope potential is subleading ( where @xmath11 is reserved for interactions that have to be iterated to reproduce the non - perturbative physics of the @xmath23-waves ) .      here",
    "we will determine the perturbative character of ope in the peripheral singlets by means of a direct calculation .",
    "in first place we will solve the schrdinger equation with the ope potential to obtain the non - perturbative phase shift @xmath33 , where @xmath34 indicates the orbital angular momentum . in a second step",

    ", we can check the convergence of the perturbative series .    at this point",
    "we find it worth commenting that this kind of direct comparison can only be used in the singlets . as it is well - known , the ope potential comprises central and tensor pieces .",
    "the former is regular , and hence the phase shifts and their perturbative expansion are well - defined .",
    "but the latter is singular : to determine whether the tensor piece is perturbative or not requires renormalization . in the singlet channels only the central piece of the ope potential",
    "is involved in the calculations .",
    "this is what makes possible the simple analysis we pursue in this section .",
    "the calculations are done as follows . for the phase shifts ,",

    "we solve it with a regular boundary condition at the origin , i.e. @xmath38 .",
    "we can extract the phase shifts from the asymptotic behavior of the wave function at large distances ( @xmath39 ) : @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 are reduced spherical bessel functions . for obtaining the non - perturbative phase shifts",
    ", we will match the asymptotic expression above to the reduced wave function @xmath43 at the infrared cut - off @xmath44 .",
    "in contrast , if we are interested in the perturbative phase shifts , the asymptotic matching will not be the method of choice .",
    "we will find much more useful instead the following integral representation of the phase shift : @xmath45 in which the wave function @xmath46 is normalized as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : asymptotic ] ) .",
    "the advantage of the integral formula above is that it is better suited for a perturbative calculation : with a wave function of order @xmath47 we can calculate the phase shift at order @xmath48 .",
    "a derivation of this formula can be found in appendix [ app : integral ] .",

    "now we evaluate the previous perturbative differential equations and integrals to calculate the phase shifts .",
    "we remind that the form of the central piece ( the only one we need in the singlets ) of the ope potential is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 ( @xmath67 for the singlets ) , @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the nucleon mass and @xmath70 is the characteristic momentum scale of ope , defined as @xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath73 . by _ characteristic scale _ we mean the following : we naively expect the ope to behave perturbatively for momenta @xmath74 , while for higher momenta it becomes non - perturbative  @xcite .",
    "as we will see , this is not the case in the peripheral singlets .",
    "we have previously commented that the perturbative expansion is finite and well - defined in the singlets . yet",
    "we will keep a finite cut - off in the calculations .",
    "in particular we regularize the ope potential as follows @xmath75 which simply amounts to changing the lower limit of the perturbative integrals from @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",
    "the reasons for having a cut - off are : i ) in actual eft calculations ( including counterterms and the two - pion exchange potential , which we have ignored in this work ) a finite cut - off is a must , ii ) the computational requirements of doing perturbation theory to high order decrease significantly with a finite cut - off  ) and ( [ eq : pertn ] ) .",
    "owing to the number of differential equations involved it is increasingly difficult to solve it for small cut - offs when i ) we increase the perturbative order for which we integrate and ii ) we increase the angular momentum , particularly at low momenta .",
    "the chosen cut - off is actually on the limit of what we can compute at fourth order , yet it is more than enough for a nuclear eft calculation . ] .",
    "we have chosen @xmath78 as a reference value for the cut - off .",
    "for this cut - off the perturbative calculations with ope have already converged ( as a matter of fact , there are only tiny differences in the results for @xmath79 ) . besides , @xmath78 is also significantly below the standard cut - off ranges employed in previous eft calculations in @xmath59-space  @xcite . for an @xmath23-wave",
    "the equivalence of the previous @xmath59-space cut - off with a sharp @xmath80-space cut - off is @xmath81 , where we have used the relationship @xmath82 .",
    "this relationship can be obtained by comparing the running of the @xmath23-wave counterterm @xmath83 in a pionless theory for a delta - shell @xmath59-space regulator @xmath84 and a sharp cut - off @xmath80-space regulator @xmath9 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the extension of the previous relationship for peripheral partial waves is trivial , yielding the numerical values @xmath85 for a @xmath17 wave , @xmath86 for a @xmath18 wave and higher values for @xmath87 . for checking purposes",
    "we explicitly show the cut - off dependence of the isoscalar partial waves in fig .",
    "[ fig : w - cutoff ] , where it can be appreciated that the more peripheral the wave the weaker the cut - off dependence .",
    "we have chosen to show the isoscalar channels because it is for these channels that central ope is strongest , yielding more cut - off dependence . yet , with the exception of the @xmath27 channel for @xmath88 ( already a relatively large cut - off ) , the cut - off dependence ranges from rather mild ( @xmath29 ) to negligible ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "we obtain the phase shifts shown in figure [ fig : w - ope ] , where we can appreciate that the perturbative expansion is converging extremely quickly even for the @xmath27 wave , the lowest partial wave considered .",
    "the perturbative series is more convergent the higher the partial wave : the tree level ( that is , the born approximation ) phase shifts already match the non - perturbative ones with a precision of a fraction of a degree , with the exception of the @xmath27 wave .",
    "all this indicates that the convergence parameter of the perturbative expansion is certainly smaller ( i.e. a faster convergence ) than that of the eft for the particular case of the singlet waves .",
    "in this section we will discuss the role of angular momentum for the power counting of the singlets .",
    "the aim is to explain the fast convergence rate of the perturbative series for central ope in the singlets .",
    "as already seen , the iteration of the ope potential is suppressed in the peripheral waves with respect to the expectations of standard power counting .",
    "however , the problem is how to incorporate the peripheral suppression into the eft expansion . for that we have to quantify the size of this effect .",
    "we will discuss a series of ideas to find the factor by which the iteration of the ope potential is suppressed in the higher partial waves .",
    "we begin by considering the peripheral suppression of a finite - range potential in standard quantum mechanics .",
    "the arguments are straightforward and relatively well - known , but we find it convenient to repeat them for illustrative purposes .",
    "this type of suppression is only apparent at momenta far below the inverse of the range of the potential , i.e. @xmath90 for nuclear forces .",
    "this means that it will help to explain the power counting in pionless theories .",
    "however , the application to pionful theories will be limited to very peripheral waves .",
    "first we begin by considering the matrix element of a central potential in the partial wave @xmath34 , which is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the standard spherical bessel function and @xmath37 the potential in coordinate space . in the born approximation",
    "the size of this matrix element for @xmath93 is proportional to the scattering amplitude .",
    "if we compare @xmath94 for different angular momenta we can obtain a baseline estimation of the peripheral suppression factor .",
    "we can do this by calculating the ratio of @xmath95 against a reference partial wave @xmath96 .",
    "a natural choice is the @xmath17 wave as it is the smallest angular momenta considered in this work .",
    "there is the complication that even ( odd ) partial waves are isoscalars ( isovectors ) .",
    "this can be circumvented by taking into account the isospin factors @xmath68 into the definition of the ratio @xmath97 where @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 or @xmath101 depending on the total isospin of a particular channel .",
    "we have calculated the inverse of this ratio in figure [ fig : ratio - born ] , where the choice of the inverse is for illustrating the suppression in a more obvious way . as can be seen",
    "as the angular momentum increases the suppression becomes much bigger , especially at low energies .",
    "the next step is to quantify this effect by means of a more concrete argument .",
    "for instance we can expand eq .",
    "( [ eq : v - central ] ) at low momenta . for @xmath102 we can expand @xmath103 as @xmath104 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we take into account that for radii @xmath105 the ope potential falls off exponentially , then for momenta @xmath106 : @xmath107 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have plugged the expansion of the spherical bessel function into the integral . as can be seen ,",
    "the power law piece of the matrix element is in fact consistent with the behavior of the lowest - order @xmath34-wave counterterm in pionless theory ( @xmath24 ) , in agreement with naive expectations .",
    "in addition , if we take into account the exponential tail of ope it is apparent that @xmath108 which means that every @xmath109 and @xmath110 within the expansion of the potential is divided by a @xmath111 .",
    "that is , we find the expected breakdown scale of the pionless power counting .",
    "this begs the question about whether the previous argument can be used to justify the peripheral demotion of ope , and in principle the answer is yes : if @xmath112 the argument applies over all the range of validity of the pionful theory . using @xmath113 this happens for @xmath114 ,",
    "for which a demotion of ope similar to the one found in pionless eft will begin to show up .",
    "however this is of little value for practical purposes . though we can show that a peripheral demotion indeed exists it is only apparent for extremely high angular momenta , far beyond where the partial - wave expansion is truncated in three - body calculations .",
    "this means that we have to resort to a different type of argument for analyzing the demotion at moderate angular momenta .",
    "we will do this in the next section .      here",
    "we consider the peripheral wave suppression from the power - counting perspective .",
    "the idea is to find a relationship between the scales of a two - body system and the angular momentum .",
    "the arguments we present are in principle tailored for the particular case of the ope potential in the singlet channels , in which case the potential is regular and we do not have to take into account the issue of cut - off dependence .",
    "we begin by writing the ope potential in the form @xmath115 which underlines the scales that enter into the problem : @xmath70 is the natural momentum scale of ope and we factor out the @xmath116 that always appears in non - relativistic scattering . in the formula above @xmath117",
    "is a dimensionless function defined as @xmath118 where @xmath119  the central piece of the ope potential after removing the @xmath120 factor  is given by @xmath121    the scale @xmath70 determines the strength of the ope potential in the singlets , modulo the spin and isospin factors which we have included in the dimensionless function @xmath117 .",
    "how to count @xmath70 determines whether ope is perturbative or not .",
    "if we iterate the ope potential , we can argue on dimensional grounds that @xmath122 where @xmath95 stands for the @xmath34-wave projection of the ope potential and @xmath3 is either the external momentum @xmath123 or the pion mass @xmath124 . from this estimation , we can see that the decision of iterating ope or not depends on the dimensionless ratio @xmath125 .    at this point",
    "we have the choices @xmath126 ( weinberg ) and @xmath127 ( kaplan - savage - wise , or ksw ) .",
    "the first requires the iteration of ope at lo and the second not .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath128 lies in between of what one could consider a soft and a hard scale . as a matter of fact , none of the previous counting conventions works for all partial waves : on one hand we have the @xmath129 and @xmath130 triplets where ope is thought to be non - perturbative , while on the other we have the peripheral singlets where the explicit calculations of section  [ sec : perturbative ] show that ope is perturbative and probably demoted even with respect to the @xmath127 scenario .",
    "the previous mismatch between scaling expectations and numerical calculations lies in the dimensionless functions and numerical factors conforming the potential .",
    "usually we naively assume that these dimensionless factors are of @xmath131 and do not affect the counting .",
    "but if that were the case ope would be either perturbative or non - perturbative in all partial waves .",
    "if we take into account these factors , we can have a clearer idea of what _",
    "soft _ and _ hard",
    "_ means for @xmath70 .    to be more specific ,",
    "let us consider the @xmath34-wave @xmath12-matrix of the ope potential in the absence of contact - range physics .",
    "if we define the on - shell @xmath12-matrix as : @xmath132 then  according to the naive analysis of eq .",
    "( [ eq : loop - size ] )  we should have the expansion @xmath133 where @xmath3 is either @xmath123 or @xmath124 and @xmath47 refers to the number of loops .",
    "we expect the coefficients / functions @xmath134 to be of @xmath131 . on dimensional grounds the @xmath135 are functions of @xmath136 , as can be deduced from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ope - reduced - form ] ) .",
    "the dependence on the angular momentum quantum number @xmath34 enters via the specific value of the coefficients . as a consequence , provided that the naturalness hypothesis for @xmath137 is correct , the convergence radius of the series is independent of @xmath34 .    on the contrary , if the convergence of perturbative ope depends on the partial wave , then the form of the loop expansion must take a different form @xmath138 where , as in the previous case , @xmath47 refers to the number of loops and the coefficients @xmath139 are @xmath131 .",
    "however we include now a factor @xmath140 to account for the different expansion parameter and convergence radius in each partial wave @xmath34 .",
    "this factor means that @xmath125 is not the ratio to check when discussing the power counting of ope , but rather @xmath141 .",
    "the only problem left is to determine the expansion parameter of the power series for @xmath142 . from complex analysis we know that the radius of convergence of this series is given by the pole of @xmath142 that is closest to the threshold",
    ". however the ope potential is relatively weak , which means that the poles of the @xmath12-matrix will be far from threshold and not easy to find . with this in mind",
    "we can resort to a trick to circumvent this difficulty .",
    "instead of finding the poles of @xmath142 for the physical value of @xmath70 , we can change the scale @xmath70 up to the point that there is a pole at @xmath143 , i.e. a bound state at threshold",
    ".    we will give the name @xmath144 to the critical value of @xmath70 that generates a bound state at threshold in the @xmath34-wave .",
    "for @xmath144 the perturbative series at @xmath143 ( the location of the threshold bound state ) diverges : @xmath145 where the notation @xmath146 indicates that this is the @xmath12-matrix for @xmath144 .",
    "this means that the expansion parameter is one for the previous series @xmath147 consequently , for the physical @xmath70 we have at @xmath148 : @xmath149 from which it is clear that the expansion parameter is simply @xmath150 .    for finite momenta @xmath151",
    "the analysis can be extended easily , though the conclusions are not as clear - cut as for @xmath148 .",
    "we begin by disentangling the @xmath152 power series explicitly in the perturbative expansion of the @xmath12-matrix @xmath153 where @xmath154 are coefficients that differentiate the contributions coming from powers of @xmath124 and @xmath123 .",
    "the point is that we can rearrange the previous expansion as @xmath155 where the new coefficients @xmath156 are defined as @xmath157 if the coefficients @xmath154 are of order one , the expansion parameter of the perturbative series will still be @xmath150 for @xmath158 .",
    "meanwhile for @xmath159 the expansion parameter is of the order @xmath160 , which amount to assuming that @xmath124 and @xmath123 play the same role in the expansion .",
    "however we can not discard the possibility of relative numerical factors between the expansions in powers of @xmath124 and @xmath123 .",
    "for instance , it could happen that the @xmath161 or that @xmath162 , giving a different convergence radius in terms of @xmath123 than in terms of @xmath124 .",
    "though this makes no difference at the conceptual level , this effect could have a moderate impact when estimating the peripheral demotion of ope .",
    "we will briefly discuss this at the end of the section , but we can advance that the impact is going to be negligible .",
    "part of the reason lies in the fact that the ope for @xmath163 is very similar to the coulomb potential , which happens to be always perturbative except for low energies . in terms of the perturbative expansion this translates into the coefficients @xmath154",
    "having a behavior with respect to @xmath164 that is extremely suppressed ( e.g. @xmath165 ) .    for quantizing the power counting demotion",
    ", we compare the expansion parameter of perturbative ope with the expansion parameter of nuclear eft , @xmath166 putting the pieces together the actual order of ope in the @xmath34-wave singlet is @xmath167 , instead of @xmath11 as in weinberg or @xmath168 as in ksw countings .",
    "it is important to mention here that the existence of a peripheral demotion @xmath169 hangs on the fact that the scale separation in nuclear eft is imperfect .",
    "that is , the clear peripheral demotion we observe depends on the fact that the separation of scales in nuclear eft is not particularly good .",
    "if we use the values @xmath170 and @xmath113 , the expansion parameter lies theoretically between @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "however , we mention in passing that concrete calculations  @xcite and analyses  @xcite in pionful eft suggest an expansion parameter closer to @xmath172 than @xmath171 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rescaling ] we calculate the ratio @xmath173 for the peripheral singlets as a function of the angular momentum @xmath34 . for convenience",
    "we consider the angular momentum as a continuous variable   real  instead of integer  and determine the location of the threshold bound states from the asymptotic condition @xmath174 . in practice",
    "we take an infrared cut - off of @xmath175 , though the results are stable for @xmath176 . ] and include the actual peripheral waves as particular points along this curve . in the isoscalar partial waves the ratio is negative , the reason being that the ope potential is repulsive in isoscalar singlets .",
    "the specific values of the @xmath173 ratios leading to a bound state at threshold are shown in table [ tab : counting ] , where we also list the effective order at which ope enters in each peripheral singlet .",
    "the power counting is normalized in agreement with the conventions of the previous discussion : @xmath11 corresponds to a potential that has to be iterated to all orders ( for instance , the lowest - order contact interaction in the @xmath177 partial wave ) and @xmath168 to the size of the ope potential in the ksw counting . even for the @xmath27 partial wave ope",
    "is slightly demoted with respect to ksw .",
    "table [ tab : counting ] only shows partial waves for which ope is not much demoted beyond @xmath178 ( considering the average demotion ) .",
    "the reason for this is because contributions above this order are unlikely to enter in any practical eft calculation in the near future .",
    "the chiral nuclear potential has not been used beyond leading three - pion exchange ( or subsubleading tpe ) in full eft calculations  .",
    "this piece of the potential enters at @xmath178 in a weinberg - inspired counting   in the traditional notation used in ref .",
    "@xcite , which skips one order because the @xmath179 contribution vanishes . ] and at @xmath180 in a ksw - inspired one ( for which the convergence is expected to be slower , leading to a stronger peripheral demotion ) . thus is does not seem necessary to go beyond that point .",
    "the spread in the demotion depends on the expansion parameter taken : for @xmath171 the demotion is relatively mild  the lowest estimation in table [ tab : counting ]  , while for @xmath172 it is much more obvious .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath27 case @xmath181 corresponds to @xmath171 and @xmath182 to @xmath172 . if we take into account the observation that the actual expansion parameter seems to be closer to @xmath172 , then the larger estimations for the demotion are expected to be more accurate than the lower ones .",
    "however overestimating the demotion can lead to the underestimation of the theoretical errors in a calculation . in this sense",
    "it might be more cautious to use a value in the middle .",
    "apart from the uncertainty in @xmath179 there is a second source of error in table [ tab : counting ] , namely the interplay between the @xmath123 and @xmath124 expansions that we have previously discussed at the qualitative level .",
    "addressing this problem formally is beyond the scope of this manuscript and in fact it has never been done in the literature for a pionful eft expansion .",
    "so instead of analyzing in detail the perturbative expansion , we will explore the demotion with an alternative definition of @xmath144 , since this scale is up to a certain extent condition - dependent .",
    "previously we defined @xmath144 as the @xmath70 for which there is a bound state at threshold . as a consequence",
    ", the ratio @xmath150 corresponds to the expansion parameter of the @xmath12-matrix at zero energy .",
    "however , the existence of a low - lying virtual state or resonance also calls for the iteration of the potential , the required strength of the potential being weaker than in the bound state case .",
    "therefore we release the definition of the scale @xmath183 as the value of @xmath70 for which there is a pole at @xmath184 ( either a bound / virtual state or a resonance , which means that @xmath185 is a complex value ) , this new scale is related to the convergence of the @xmath12-matrix for the physical value of @xmath70 at the location of the pole @xmath186 in turn we could have used @xmath183 as the basis of an alternative definition of the peripheral demotion @xmath187 in terms of the scale @xmath188 , if we choose a bound state with @xmath189 we will get a smaller @xmath188 ( i.e. more strength for the ope potential ) and more demotion ( @xmath190 ) . on the contrary the virtual state / resonance condition  let s say at a momentum @xmath191  entails a bigger @xmath188 , i.e. a smaller @xmath173 ratio , and less peripheral demotion ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "actually we are more interested in the possibility that we might have been overestimating the demotion , which means that we only have to consider the virtual - state / resonance case .",
    "we have performed the calculations in appendix [ app : resonances ] and checked that the effect of a change in conditions from a threshold bound state to a resonance is actually tiny for @xmath193 , usually of the order of @xmath194 .",
    "if we compare this change to the uncertainty related to @xmath179 , which lies in the range @xmath195 , we see that corrections to the threshold bound state condition can be safely ignored in most partial waves .",

    "we show the critical value of @xmath70 that renders the central potential non - perturbative in each of the singlets .",

    "<S> ' '' ''    we analyze the power counting of the peripheral singlet partial waves in nucleon - nucleon scattering . in agreement with conventional wisdom </S>",
    "<S> , we find that pion exchanges are perturbative in the peripheral singlets . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify from the effective field theory perspective the well - known suppression induced by the centrifugal barrier in the pion - exchange interactions . by exploring perturbation theory up to fourth order </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the one - pion - exchange potential in these channels is demoted from leading to subleading order by a given power of the expansion parameter that grows with the orbital angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of these demotions for few - body calculations : though higher partial waves have been known for a long time to be irrelevant in these calculations ( and are hence ignored ) , here we explain how to systematize the procedure in a way that is compatible with the effective field theory expansion .    </S>",
    "<S> the derivation of nuclear forces from first principles is one of the central problems of nuclear physics . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the nuclear potential  though not an observable  is the theoretical object from which we usually derive the properties of nuclei and calculate their reaction rates . with the recent onset of _ ab initio _ calculations , the direct link between nuclear forces and nuclear structure can be established for the first time , at least for light nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> yet the understanding of nuclear forces from quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) remains incomplete .    </S>",
    "<S> nowadays , among the strategies to explain nuclear observables from qcd the most promising are lattice qcd and effective field theory ( eft ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first approach tries to calculate nuclear properties directly from qcd . </S>",
    "<S> lattice qcd , though close to , is still not able to explain light nuclei in the physical world , i.e. for the physical pion mass . </S>",
    "<S> first calculations for pion masses larger than the physical one are promising  @xcite and it is apparent that @xmath0 will be reached soon . the second approach  the eft formulation  establishes the connection between nuclear physics and qcd indirectly , avoiding the requirement of complex lattice qcd calculations ( see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for reviews ) . </S>",
    "<S> nuclear eft is the renormalization group evolution of qcd at low energies and thus equivalent to qcd . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is to write down the most general lagrangian involving the low - energy fields and respecting the low - energy symmetries of qcd , in particular chiral symmetry . in this regard </S>",
    "<S> nuclear eft simply amounts to rewriting the qcd lagrangian in terms of a different set of fields , nucleons and pions instead of quarks and gluons .    </S>",
    "<S> a key ingredient of nuclear eft is the existence of a separation of scales . </S>",
    "<S> pions and nucleons are no longer valid degrees of freedoms at momenta above a characteristic hard scale @xmath1 of the order of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> yet most nuclear processes of interest happen at a softer scale @xmath3 of the order of @xmath4 , which can be identified with the typical momenta of nucleons inside nuclei or with the pion mass . </S>",
    "<S> moreover on a first approximation naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) suggests that the dimensionful couplings of the eft might be natural when expressed in units of the hard scale @xmath1 . from this point of view @xmath1 can be interpreted as the natural qcd mass scale for hadrons @xmath5 ( of the order of the rho or the nucleon mass , not to be confused with the qcd perturbative scale @xmath6 ) or @xmath7 . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> we can write the scattering amplitude in eft as a power series in terms of the ratio between the soft - scale @xmath3 and the hard - scale @xmath1 : @xmath8 this property goes under the name of power counting and is probably the most useful feature of eft . </S>",
    "<S> power counting implies that we can organize the calculations to achieve a given goal of accuracy and lies at the core of the systematics of the eft approach .    </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the existence of a power counting depends on _ renormalizability_. eft expresses the interactions among its fields as a low - energy expansion . while at low momenta @xmath3 each term in this expansion is smaller than the previous one , at high momenta @xmath1 the contrary happens and eventually the eft interactions diverge in the ultraviolet . </S>",
    "<S> this does not pose a conceptual problem because eft is only expected to work at low energies . </S>",
    "<S> but it poses a technical one : the ultraviolet divergences threaten to destroy the low - energy eft expansion via loop corrections . </S>",
    "<S> the way to deal with this issue is _ renormalization _ : we introduce a cut - off @xmath9 to regularize the loops , include counterterms to absorb the @xmath9-dependence and finally check that the low - energy observables do not depend on the choice of @xmath9 . cut - off independence , i.e. renormalizability , is therefore a necessary condition to have power counting in eft . </S>",
    "<S> renormalizability and power counting are intimately intertwined , a feature that is emphasized for instance in wilsonian renormalization  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if renormalizability is absent at a certain order we have to include new contact interactions until cut - off independence is restored , which in turn constrains the power counting . </S>",
    "<S> if for some reason our prejudices about power counting do not lead to a renormalizable eft , they have to be revisited and amended .    </S>",
    "<S> traditional eft knowledge is perturbative , chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) being a good example . </S>",
    "<S> the understanding of the renormalization group analysis of non - perturbative physics  as is the case in nuclear physics  </S>",
    "<S> is recent in comparison . </S>",
    "<S> but the first formulation of nuclear eft , the weinberg counting  @xcite , predates these developments . to deal with the non - perturbative features of nuclear physics , </S>",
    "<S> the weinberg counting applies not directly to the scattering amplitude but rather to the nuclear potential : @xmath10 the rationale is that , though power counting is not obvious for the scattering amplitude in the non - perturbative case , it is for the potential . </S>",
    "<S> thus the idea is to iterate the eft potential , or at least the leading order ( @xmath11 ) piece , in the lippmann - schwinger ( or schrdinger ) equation with the implicit expectation that the resulting @xmath12-matrix follows the eft expansion @xmath13 taking into account the simplicity of the approach outlined by weinberg it comes as no surprise the enthusiasm with which it has been followed , leading to the development of two - nucleon potentials with @xmath14  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> yet there is a fly in the ointment : it is not clear whether the scattering amplitudes follow a power counting in weinberg s proposal . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the situation is rather the contrary . </S>",
    "<S> several works have shown once and again  @xcite that the weinberg counting is not renormalizable . as the cut - off is increased above @xmath15 , the scattering amplitudes show all kinds of fascinating behavior with the notable exception of cut - off independence . </S>",
    "<S> the most natural interpretation of the previous results is that renormalization is lost in the weinberg counting . not only that , the connection with qcd disappears because this approach does not make for a proper eft . </S>",
    "<S> we mention in passing that a few authors have proposed to reinterpret what renormalization means in order to accommodate the previous observations in the weinberg counting  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is adequate as long as one does not insist on a clear power counting ( beyond the vague impression that calculations get better at higher orders ) and a direct connection to qcd . </S>",
    "<S> however this is not the solution for an appropriate nuclear eft . </S>",
    "<S> rather we should strive to get scattering amplitudes that are unambiguously renormalizable and have a power counting .    as a matter of fact there exists already a consistent version of nuclear eft  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is renormalizable , can describe the scattering amplitudes for @xmath16 , converges well and power counting is realized at the level of observables . </S>",
    "<S> its foundation relies on a better understanding of the renormalization of non - perturbative physics and singular interactions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the key improvements over the original weinberg proposal are the non - perturbative renormalization of the @xmath11 amplitudes and the addition of subleading order contributions as perturbations . at @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> the main difference with the weinberg counting lies in the promotion of a series of @xmath17- and @xmath18-wave counterterms to @xmath11 in triplet partial waves for which the tensor force is attractive , a change proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . at subleading orders </S>",
    "<S> there are more counterterms than in weinberg counting , for instance in the attractive triplets that already received a counterterm at @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the convergence of the eft expansion is acceptable and the description of the data too , but it has not achieved yet a @xmath19 as in the weinberg approach . </S>",
    "<S> however this is expected if we take into account that the calculations of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite are still one order below the most advanced ones in the weinberg approach  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one prediction of the original weinberg counting is that the one - pion - exchange ( ope ) potential  </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath11 nuclear potential  is _ always _ non - perturbative . </S>",
    "<S> yet this is in contradiction with common wisdom in nuclear physics . </S>",
    "<S> pion exchanges have been known for a long time to be perturbative in peripheral partial waves  @xcite . while this is easy to understand in terms of the repulsive centrifugal barrier for high angular momenta ( @xmath20 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the analogous explanation in terms of power counting has traditionally remained elusive . from time to time </S>",
    "<S> this has been discussed in the literature  @xcite , but rather as an afterthought . </S>",
    "<S> this peripheral demotion already happens for moderate angular momenta @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> different arbitrary angular momentum cut - offs for when to consider ope perturbative ( or not ) have been proposed , usually in the range @xmath22 . however , taking into account that the importance of this matter is rather tangential in two - body calculations , it comes as no surprise the disinterest for this particular problem  -wave counterterms are less relevant than the @xmath23-wave ones by a factor of @xmath24 in naive dimensional analysis . ] . </S>",
    "<S> the task of power counting should be to quantify the size of the peripheral wave suppression to systematically include it in eft calculations .    the answer to this question is not only of academic interest , but has practical implications too . </S>",
    "<S> the main applications are few - body calculations , which usually require the inclusion of contributions arising from two - body partial waves up to a critical value of the orbital angular momentum ( typically @xmath25 or @xmath26 in the three - nucleon system  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> yet the choice of a maximum angular momentum is driven by numerical considerations rather than by the constraints that the eft expansion imposes on the accuracy of physical observables .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this manuscript is to translate the quantum - mechanical peripheral - wave suppression into a power - counting demotion of the ope potential . </S>",
    "<S> this will allow to take the decisions regarding which two - body partial waves to ignore based on power - counting arguments . </S>",
    "<S> that means improving the systematics of these calculations or even simplifying them at the lowest orders where probably very few partial waves need to be included . here </S>",
    "<S> we limit ourselves to the spin - singlet waves where ope is not singular and thus can be defined without counterterms .    </S>",
    "<S> the manuscript is structured as follows . in section [ sec : perturbative ] we will compare the non - perturbative ope predictions for the phase shifts in the singlets with their perturbative expansion . </S>",
    "<S> this will allow us to check up to what point ope is perturbative . in section [ sec : demotion ] we will find a power - counting explanation for the peripheral demotion of central ope , which will later be checked against numerical calculations of the expansion parameter of central ope . </S>",
    "<S> finally we will present our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusion ] . </S>"
