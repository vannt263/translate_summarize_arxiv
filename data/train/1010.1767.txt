    "the absence of the energetic gap in the excitation spectrum of graphene@xcite is considered as a possible drawback preventing the straightforward application of this emerging material in electronics .",
    "this is despite numerous efforts , such as those implying surface patterning@xcite and substrate- or adsorbents - induced interactions.@xcite the possibility to open and tune the band gap in the bilayer graphene has recently been demonstrated by applying an electric field perpendicular to the graphitic planes@xcite and this is a key element to construct a transistor , the building block of electronic circuits .",
    "the band gap engineering is `` typical '' of the bilayer and is not reported in tri- and more - layer graphene specimens where semi - metallic behavior dominates.@xcite from the viewpoint of applications , the bilayer graphene thus becomes almost equally appealing material as graphene itself .",
    "optical spectroscopy has played an important role in investigations of the bilayer graphene,@xcite as , for instance , it allows to directly visualize the electric - field induced energy gap in this system.@xcite on the other hand , only relatively scarce information has been up to now collected from _",
    "magneto_-optical measurements.@xcite this fact might be surprising when noticing the potential of landau level ( ll ) spectroscopy which has been widely applied to other graphene - like systems .",
    "magneto - optical methods have , for example , convincingly illustrated the unconventional ll spectrum in graphene , have offered a reliable estimate of the fermi velocity or invoked the specific effects of many - body interactions between massless dirac fermions.@xcite    so far , the only magneto - optical experiments on the bilayer graphene have been reported by henriksen _",
    "et al._,@xcite who succeeded to probe a relatively weak cyclotron - resonance signal of a small flake using the gate - controlled differential technique . the optical response at a fixed magnetic field",
    "was then studied as a function of the carrier density .",
    "such differential spectroscopy was efficient in case of exfoliated graphene monolayers,@xcite but it provides more complex results when applied to the bilayer graphene . in this latter system ,",
    "the change of the gate voltage affects not only the carrier density but also modifies significantly the band structure and data interpretation is by far more elaborated.@xcite    in this paper , we demonstrate that certain class of previously reported ab - stacking faults@xcite in otherwise rotationally - ordered multilayer epitaxial graphene ( meg),@xcite show the characteristic features of well - defined graphene bilayers .",
    "these inclusions , identified here in magneto - transmission experiments , represent therefore a suitable system for accurate magneto - spectroscopy studies of unperturbed bilayer graphene .",
    "the growth of meg samples studied here was performed with a commercially available horizontal chemical vapor deposition hot - wall reactor ( epigress v508 ) , inductively heated by a rf generator .",
    "epitaxial meg films were grown on semi - insulating 4h - sic(0001 ) on - axis c - terminated substrates at 1600@xmath0c in ar atmosphere .",
    "the growth rate was controlled by the ar pressure ( @xmath1100  mbar ) which was found to directly influence the evaporation rate of si atoms .    to measure the infrared transmittance of our samples",

    "the transmitted light was detected by a composite bolometer kept at @xmath2  k and placed directly below the sample .",
    "measurements were carried out in superconducting ( @xmath3  t ) and resistive ( @xmath4  t ) solenoids with spectral resolution of 0.5 and 1  mev in the range of magnetic field below and above @xmath5  t , respectively .",
    "all presented spectra were normalized by the sample transmission at @xmath6 .",
    "the samples were characterized in micro - raman scattering experiments which , similarly to previous studies,@xcite revealed , depending on location , single - component 2d band features , characteristic of graphene simple electronic bands and of decoupled graphitic planes in multilayer epitaxial graphene grown on the c - face of a sic substrate , or multi - component 2d band features characteristic of bernal stacked graphite . in this paper , we present transmission data obtained on one particular specimen with a high number of graphitic layers ( @xmath7 ) and grown on a sic substrate with a reduced thickness of @xmath7  @xmath8 m . due to this latter condition",
    ", the spectral region of total opacity of the sample only covers the sic reststrahlenband ( @xmath185 - 120 mev ) , i.e. , it is significantly narrower as compared to the case of the preceding studies.@xcite in spite of these efforts to expand the available spectral range , a relatively weak transmission was still found around the energy of 200  mev , due to double - phonon absorptions in the underlying sic substrate and transmission spectra are affected by strong interference patterns due to the relatively thin substrate . these two effects prevented measurements in the energy range below the reststrahlenband of sic",
    "typical transmission spectra of the investigated sample are shown in fig .",
    "the dominant absorption lines which are observed in these spectra show the characteristic @xmath9-dependence ( see fig .",

    "we denote those lines by roman letters , following the initial work and notation of sadowski _ _ et al.__@xcite these dominant spectral features are equivalent to the characteristic lines observed in the magneto - optical response of exfoliated graphene monolayers.@xcite the subsequent absorption lines labelled here as b  @xmath10  i correspond to transitions l@xmath11l@xmath12 with @xmath13 between lls in graphene : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",
    "the apparent fermi velocity is extracted to be @xmath16  m.s@xmath17 .",
    "intriguingly , the l@xmath18l@xmath19 transition exhibits a significant broadening above 16  t , which could be tentatively related to electron - phonon interaction .",
    "this effect will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the main focus of the present work are other spectral features , i.e. , the transmission dips denoted by @xmath20 in fig .",
    "these absorption lines are significantly weaker than the dominant `` graphene lines '' , but are still well resolved in our spectra . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fanchart ] , in contrast to the dominant transitions , these weaker lines follow a nearly linear in @xmath21 dependence . as",
    "this behavior is characteristic of massive particles and because graphene bilayer is the simplest graphene based system with such particles , we anticipate that electronic excitations within graphene bilayer inclusions are responsible for the @xmath22 transitions .",
    "the energy ladder @xmath23 of lls in a graphene bilayer can be easily calculated@xcite within the standard four band model which only considers the two most relevant coupling constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( se e.g. ref .   for their definitions ) :    @xmath26^{1/2}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    here , a positive ( negative ) integer @xmath27 indexes the electron ( hole ) lls .",

    "[ fanchart ] , optically active inter landau level transitions in a graphene bilayer fulfill the @xmath30 with black solid lines .",
    "those lines account for the transitions within the @xmath28 bands . to reproduce the experimental data , we have adjusted the @xmath25 parameter whereas the fermi velocity @xmath31 which defines @xmath32 ( i.e. the intra - layer coupling @xmath33  mev ) has been fixed at the value derived from the monolayer - like transitions .",
    "a fair agreement is obtained between the calculated ( solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fanchart ] ) and measured energies of @xmath34 transitions .",
    "optical absorptions involving lls of higher indexes ( e.g. @xmath35 and @xmath36 , see fig .",
    "[ fanchart ] ) could also be observed in the spectra , nevertheless , these lines are very weak and only visible in a limited range of magnetic fields",
    ". traces of inter - ll transitions due to split - off bands ( @xmath29 in eq .",
    "[ bilayer ] ) , can be also identified in our data and experiments focused on this particular set of transitions are in progress .",
    "a pronounced departure of the observed bilayer transitions from the linearity in @xmath21 clearly shows the limits of the parabolic approximation which is often used for graphene bilayers in the close vicinity of the @xmath37 point , and within which the lls are strictly linear with the magnetic field.@xcite as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fanchart ] , the positions of all these lines can be very well reproduced with a parameter @xmath38  mev , and these experiments thus refine the value of this parameter reported previously from optical studies at zero magnetic field.@xcite the intriguing splitting of the @xmath39 and of the @xmath40 lines at high magnetic fields is beyond our simple model and will be discussed later on .",
    "the simplified model of lls in the pristine bilayer graphene provides us with reasonably accurate description of its magneto - optical response , even though it neglects the electron - hole asymmetry ( mainly induced by tight - binding @xmath41 parameters),@xcite as well as a possible gap opening at the charge neutrality point .",
    "nevertheless , it should be noted that the optical response of the graphene bilayer has only been unambiguously identified above the reststrahlenband of the sic substrate and therefore , we can not exclude a possible appearance of an energy gap , up to a few tens of mev , at the @xmath37 point . for the same reason , we can only estimate a very higher limit for the carrier density in the studied bilayer of @xmath42  @xmath43 .",
    "however , the real carrier density is very likely similar to that of the surrounding ( electrically isolated ) graphene sheets , i.e. below @xmath44  @xmath43 , as reported in refs .   and .",
    "we also point out that relatively narrow linewidths of the order of 10  mev ( relaxation time in sub - picosecond range ) serve as an indication of rather high electronic quality of these bilayer inclusions , comparable or even better than other bilayer systems.@xcite    equivalent bilayer - like spectral features are recurrently identified practically in all studied specimens , nevertheless , with a strongly varying intensity . in general , we can say that the relative intensity of these `` bilayer '' lines increases with the total number of layers in meg and these transitions are practically invisible in specimens with less than 10 layers reported in very first magneto - spectroscopy studies.@xcite this finding serves as an indication that we indeed observe graphene bilayer inclusions and not regions of a local ab - stacking which might be also speculated to appear in rotationally stacked multilayers .",
    "such moir - patterned ab - stacked areas have been recently visualized in meg by stm / sts measurements.@xcite we further assume that twisted graphene layers which results in the moir patterned bilayer should not provide us with so well - defined ab stacked bilayers as we observe in our data .",
    "let us also note that if we compare the relative intensity of observed transitions , we can roughly estimate that in none of the investigated samples the ratio between bilayers and monolayers exceeded 10% .",
    "we should also emphasize that the appearance of bernal - stacked faults in meg , which have a form of well - defined bilayers , is not a signature of bulk graphite .",
    "in this well known material , the @xmath45-point electrons indeed mimic massive carriers in the graphene bilayer , but with an effective inter - layer coupling @xmath46 instead of @xmath25 in a real graphene bilayer.@xcite this twofold coupling in the effective bilayer model for @xmath45 point electrons implies a characteristic effective mass twice enhanced in comparison to that of massive dirac fermions in true graphene bilayer and consequently , also a twice lower energy separation between adjacent interband inter - ll transitions , cf . fig .",
    "[ fanchart ] of this paper with the fan chart in ref .  .",
    "the remaining unclarified point of our study is the splitting of the bilayer lines , which is clearly visible for transitions @xmath39 and @xmath40 around @xmath47 and 26  t , respectively . in the following ,",
    "we discuss two different scenarios for this splitting .",
    "one possible explanation invokes the electron - hole asymmetry , reported recently in graphene bilayers graphene.@xcite based on this assumption , the magnitude of the splitting for the @xmath27-th transition , relative to the transition energy is expressed by:@xcite @xmath48 for the values @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51,@xcite our measured value for @xmath52 ( about 0.08 ) is very well reproduced .",
    "however , the splitting due to electron - hole asymmetry should be seen for all magnetic fields , while , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ spkt]b , we only observe it in a relatively narrow range of  @xmath21 .",
    "perhaps a more natural explanation for this line splitting would be an avoided crossing between the transition @xmath53 and some other transition with a much smaller oscillator strength , so that it is not seen far from the crossing point .",
    "one can see directly from fig .",
    "[ fanchart ] that the bright transitions @xmath54 are crossed by the dark ( i.e. , dipole - inactive in case of a zero trigonal warping ) transitions @xmath55 , @xmath56 , respectively , approximately at the observed values of  @xmath21 ( the crossing occurs at a very sharp angle , which brings a significant uncertainty ) .",
    "these transitions are allowed only due to the presence of the trigonal warping of the electronic bands , which mixes levels @xmath57 with @xmath58 differing by an integer multiple of  @xmath59 , see ref .  .",
    "the ratio of the oscillator strength of the @xmath55 transition to that of the bright @xmath52 transition can be estimated  @xcite as @xmath60 at @xmath61  t. the @xmath55 transition is therefore not expected to be seen in the experiment unless some other , possibly resonant , admixture mechanism is taken into account .",
    "coupling between @xmath55 and @xmath52 transitions should be quite strong as the observed `` anti - crossing splitting '' is of about 20  mev .",
    "we have speculated this mode coupling could be due to electron - phonon or electron - electron interactions .",
    "electron - phonon interaction , which could be enhanced due to the proximity of the transition energy ( 250  mev ) to that of the zone - center optical phonon ( 196  mev ) , must be excluded due to the different symmetry ( this phonon is raman active ) . splitting due to coulomb interaction",
    "can be evaluated to be @xmath62,@xcite i.e. only about 3  mev in the absence of dielectric screening , @xmath63 .",
    "hence , the mechanism of the possible strong coupling between the @xmath64 and @xmath55 transitions is a puzzle which remains to be clarified .",
    "we probed graphene bilayers embedded in multilayer epitaxial graphene on the c - terminated surface of sic .",
    "these inclusions can be viewed as ab - stacked faults in an otherwise rotationally - stacked multilayer graphene structure and enable spectroscopic studies of unperturbed graphene bilayers .",
    "the `` electronic quality '' of these bilayers is comparable or even better than that of the bilayers obtained by exfoliation or by epitaxial growth on the si - terminated surface of sic.@xcite this way , we could trace the inter - band inter - ll transitions in the graphene bilayer for the first time , and thus supply data complementary to the cyclotron resonance absorption ( i.e. , intra - band inter - ll transitions ) measured on the exfoliated bilayer by henriksen  _ _ et al.__@xcite we could also clearly visualize the departure of landau levels in the graphene bilayer from the linearity in @xmath21 , which clearly sets limits for the parabolic approximation of electronic bands in this material .",
