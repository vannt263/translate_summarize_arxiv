    "progress in semiconductor nanotechnologies has led to developments in the fabrication of various mesoscopic objects , including quantum rings .",
    "the fundamental physical interest attracted by these systems arises from a wide variety of purely quantum - mechanical effects which can be observed in ring - like nanostructures .",
    "one of them is the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect arisen from the direct influence of the vector potential on the phase of the electron wave function . @xcite in ring - like nanostructures pierced by a magnetic flux , this effect results in the energy splitting of electron states corresponding to mutually opposite directions of electronic rotation in the ring .",
    "@xcite as a consequence , magnetic - flux - dependent oscillations of the conductance of the ring appear .",
    "@xcite since the ab effect takes place for both a single electron and many - particle quantum states , @xcite it can be observed for elementary excitations in semiconductor nanostructures as well .",
    "the simplest of them is an exciton which is a bound quantum state of a negative charged electron in the conduction band and a positive charged hole in the valence band .",
    "manifestations of various excitonic effects in semiconductor ring - like structures , including the ab effect induced by a magnetic field , have attracted great attention of both theorists @xcite and experimentalists .",
    "@xcite    fundamentally , the ab effect is caused by the broken time - reversal symmetry in an electron system subjected to a magnetic flux .",
    "namely , the flux breaks the equivalence of clockwise and counterclockwise electron rotation inside a ring - like structure , which results in the flux - controlled interference of the electron waves corresponding to these rotations .",
    "the similar broken equivalence of electron motion for mutually opposite directions caused by a magnetic field can take place in various nanostructures , including quantum wells , @xcite carbon nanotubes @xcite and hybrid semiconductor / ferromagnet nanostructures .",
    "@xcite however , the time - reversal symmetry can be broken not only by a magnetic flux but also by a circularly polarized electromagnetic field .",
    "indeed , the field breaks the symmetry since the time reversal turns clockwise polarized photons into counterclockwise polarized ones and vice versa . in quantum rings , the strong electron coupling to circularly polarized photons results in the magnetic - flux - like splitting of electron energy levels corresponding to mutually opposite electronic rotation in the ring @xcite and oscillations of the ring conductance as a function of the intensity and frequency of the irradiation .",
    "@xcite this phenomenon can be described in terms of a stationary artificial @xmath0 gauge field generated by the strong coupling between an electron and circularly polarized photons .",
    "@xcite therefore , various stationary phenomena similar to the ab effect can take place in ring - like electronic systems interacting with a circularly polarized electromagnetic field . as a consequence",
    ", the new class of quantum optical phenomena in semiconductor nanostructures appears .",
    "although a theory of these ab - like phenomena in quantum rings has been elaborated for a single electron , @xcite the optically - induced ab effect for excitons still awaits detailed analysis .",
    "the given article is aimed to fill this gap in the theory , which lies at the border between quantum optics and physics of semiconductor nanostructures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the exciton - photon hamiltonian is analyzed and solutions of the exciton - photon schrdinger problem are found . in section iii , the energy spectrum of the dressed excitons is discussed and experimental sets to detect the effect are proposed . in section iv ,",
    "conclusion is presented .",
    "an electron - hole pair in an one - dimensional quantum ring ( see fig .  [ fig.ring ] ) can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the radius of the ring , @xmath3 is the effective masse of an electron ( hole ) in the ring , @xmath4 is the potential energy of hole - electron interaction , and @xmath5 is the azimuthal angle of the electron ( hole ) in the ring . introducing the new variables , @xmath6 the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the exciton mass , and @xmath9 is the reduced exciton mass .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the stationary schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) have the form @xmath10 where the function @xmath11 meets the schrdinger equation @xmath12 @xmath13 is the exciton angular momentum along the ring axis , @xmath14 is the principal quantum number of the exciton , and @xmath15 is the exciton binding energy .",
    "correspondingly , the full energy of exciton reads as @xmath16 where the second term is the kinetic energy of rotational motion of exciton in the ring .     and",
    "@xmath17 along the ring axis.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    let the ring be subjected to a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave with the frequency @xmath18 , which propagates along the ring axis ( see fig .  [ fig.ring ] ) .",
    "then the full hamiltonian of the exciton - photon system , including both the field energy , @xmath19 , and the exciton hamiltonian , @xmath20 , is @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the operators of photon annihilation and creation , respectively , written in the schrdinger representation ( the representation of occupation numbers ) , and @xmath24 is the operator of exciton - photon interaction .",
    "generalizing the operator of electron - photon interaction in a quantum ring @xcite for the considered case of electron - hole pair , we can write this operator as @xmath25,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the electron charge , @xmath27 is the quantization volume , and @xmath28 is the vacuum permittivity . to describe the exciton - photon system ,",
    "let us use the notation @xmath29 which indicates that the electromagnetic field is in a quantum state with the photon occupation number @xmath30 , and the exciton is in a quantum state with the wave function ( [ psi ] ) .",
    "the electron - photon states @xmath29 are true eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath31 which describes the non - interacting exciton - photon system .",
    "correspondingly , their energy spectrum is @xmath32 in order to find the energy spectrum of the full electron - photon hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) , let us use the conventional perturbation theory , considering the term ( [ ur ] ) as a perturbation with the matrix elements @xmath33 .",
    "taking into account in eq .",
    "( [ ur ] ) that @xmath34 and @xmath35 , these matrix elements read as @xmath36,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 performing trivial calculations within the second order of the perturbation theory , we can derive eigenenergies of the exciton - photon hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) , @xmath38.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since eq .",
    "( [ es ] ) is derived within the second order of the perturbation theory , it describes the problem correctly if the energy differences in denominators of all terms lie far from zero . in what follows",
    ", we have to keep in mind that all parameters of the problem must lie far from these resonant points .    the energy spectrum of exciton - photon system ( [ es ] )",
    "can be written formally as @xmath39 , where the first term is the field energy .",
    "following the conventional terminology of quantum optics , @xcite the second term , @xmath40 , is the energy spectrum of the exciton dressed by the circularly polarized field ( dressing field ) . restricting our analysis by the most interesting case of classically strong dressing field ( @xmath41 )",
    ", we arrive from eq .",
    "( [ es ] ) to the sought energy spectrum of dressed exciton , @xmath42,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the classical amplitude of electric field of the electromagnetic wave .",
    "it is apparent that dressed exciton states with mutually opposite angular momenta , @xmath44 and @xmath17 , have different energies ( [ eex ] ) .",
    "physically , this should be treated as a field - induced nonequivalence of clockwise and counterclockwise exciton rotations in the ring . as a consequence , the excitonic aharonov - bohm effect induced by the circularly polarized field appears . in order to simplify the calculation of",
    "the field - induced splitting , @xmath45 , we will restrict our consideration to the case of the ground exciton state with @xmath46 .",
    "let us assume that the characteristic binding energy of exciton , @xmath47 , is much more than both the characteristic energy of rotational exciton motion , @xmath48 , and the photon energy @xmath49 .",
    "then we can neglect the field - induced mixing of exciton states with @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eex ] ) . as a result ,",
    "we arrive from eq .",
    "( [ eex ] ) to the field - induced splitting of exciton states with mutually opposite angular momenta , @xmath51,\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the characteristic energy of exciton rotation . in order to calculate the integral in eq .",
    "( [ split ] ) , we have to solve the schrdinger equation ( [ shr ] ) and find the wave function @xmath53 . approximating the electron - hole interaction potential @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ shr ] ) by the delta - function @xcite and assuming the characteristic exciton size , @xmath55 , to be much less than the ring length @xmath56 , we can write the splitting ( [ split ] ) in the final form @xmath57.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it should be stressed that the simplest delta - function model @xcite leads to reasonable results .",
    "this follows formally from the fact that the final expression ( [ eq.sqbr ] ) does not depend on model parameters : it depends only on the exciton binding energy @xmath58 which should be treated as a phenomenological parameter .",
    "we checked that numerical calculation using the coulomb potential gives very similar results to those obtained analytically for the case of the delta potential if the binding energy @xmath58 is kept the same .",
    "let us estimate the main limitation of the model one - dimensional hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) which neglects the exciton motion in the radial direction .",
    "it can be important since the radial motion weakens the ab effect in wide rings .",
    "@xcite let a ring with the radius @xmath2 has the width @xmath59 .",
    "it follows from the numerical calculations that amplitudes of the ab oscillations for the case of @xmath60 and for the case of ideal one - dimensional ring ( @xmath61 ) are almost identical.@xcite therefore , the one - dimensional hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) correctly describes the solved ab problem for typical semiconductor rings with radius @xmath2 in the tens of nanometers and width @xmath59 in the nanometer range .",
    "the field - induced splitting ( [ split])([eq.sqbr ] ) vanishes if the electron mass is equal to the hole mass , @xmath62 .",
    "physically , this can be explained in terms of an artificial @xmath0 gauge field produced by the coupling of a charged particle to circularly polarized photons .",
    "@xcite since the artificial field @xcite depends on a particle mass , it interacts differently with an electron and a hole in the case of @xmath63 . as a consequence ,",
    "the splitting ( [ split])([eq.sqbr ] ) is nonzero in the case of @xmath63 , though an exciton is electrically neutral as a whole . in the case of @xmath62 ,",
    "the artificial gauge field interacts equally with both electron and hole .",
    "however , signs of the interaction are different for the electron and the hole since electrical charges of electron and hole are opposite .",
    "therefore , the interaction of the artificial gauge field with an exciton is zero in the case of @xmath62 .     and",
    "@xmath64 in a gaas ring with the radius @xmath65 nm as a function of the exciton binding energy @xmath58 for a circularly polarized dressing field with the frequency @xmath66 ghz and different intensities @xmath67.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     and @xmath64 in a gaas ring with the radius @xmath65 nm as a function of the field intensity @xmath67 and the field frequency @xmath18 for different binding energies of the exciton : ( a ) @xmath68 mev ; ( b ) @xmath69 mev ; ( c ) @xmath70 mev ; ( d ) @xmath71 mev .",
    "the physically relevant areas of the field parameters , which correspond to applicability of the basic expressions derived within the perturbation theory , lie below of the dashed lines.,scaledwidth=52.0% ]    the splitting ( [ eq.sqbr ] ) for exciton states with the angular momenta @xmath72 and @xmath64 in a gaas quantum ring is presented graphically in figs .",
    "( [ fig2])([fig3 ] ) for various intensities of the dressing field , @xmath73 .",
    "the used effective masses of electron and holes in gaas , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , are taken from ref .  , where @xmath76 is the mass of electron in vacuum . in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) , the splitting @xmath77 is plotted as a function of the exciton binding energy , @xmath58 , which depends on the confinement potential of a quantum ring .",
    "@xcite it is apparent that the splitting decreases with increasing the binding energy .",
    "physically , this is a consequence of decreasing the exciton size , @xmath78 .",
    "indeed , an exciton with a very small size looks like an electrically neutral particle from viewpoint of the dressing electromagnetic field . as a consequence ,",
    "the splitting ( [ eq.sqbr ] ) is small for small excitons .",
    "it follows from figs .",
    "( [ fig2])([fig3 ] ) that the typical splitting is of @xmath79ev scale for stationary irradiation intensities of tens w/@xmath80 .",
    "this splitting is comparable to the lamb shift in atoms and can be detected experimentally by optical methods .",
    "it order to increase the splitting , the irradiation intensity @xmath67 should also be increased . however , the increasing of stationary irradiation can fluidize a semiconductor ring . to avoid the fluidizing ,",
    "it is reasonable to use narrow pulses of a strong dressing field which splits exciton states and narrow pulses of a weak probing field which detects the splitting .",
    "this well - known pump - and - probe methodology is elaborated long ago and commonly used to observe quantum optics effects  particularly , modifications of energy spectrum of dressed electrons arisen from the optical stark effect  in semiconductor structures ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) . within this approach , giant dressing fields ( up to gw/@xmath80 )",
    "can be applied to semiconductor structures . as a consequence ,",
    "the splitting ( [ eq.sqbr ] ) can be of mev scale in state - of - the - art optical experiments .",
    "it should be stressed that the discussed effect is qualitatively different to those arisen from absorption of circularly polarized light in quantum rings ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "namely , the absorption of photons with non - zero angular momentum by electrons leads to the transfer of angular momentum from light to electrons in a ring .",
    "correspondingly , photoinduced currents in the ring appear.@xcite since this effect is caused by light absorption , it can be described within the classical electrodynamics of ring - shaped conductors .",
    "in contrast , we consider the aharonov - bohm effect induced by light in the regime of electromagnetic dressing , when absorption of real photons is absent . to be more specific , the discussed ab effect arises from light - induced changing phase of electron wave function , which results in the appearance of the artificial gauge field @xcite and shifts exciton energy levels in the ring .",
    "evidently , this purely quantum phenomenon can not be described within classical physics .",
    "summarizing the aforesaid , we predict a new quantum - optical phenomenon in semiconductor ring - like nanostructures .",
    "namely , a high - frequency circularly polarized electromagnetic wave splits the energy levels of excitons in a semiconductor quantum ring .",
    "this effect should be treated as an optically - induced aharonov - bohm effect for excitons and can be observed in quantum rings with using modern experimental technics .",
