    "in 1958 , while working as an assistant to professor n. obreshkov , blagovest sendov raised the following question . _",
    "assume that all zeros of a polynomial @xmath0 with complex coefficients lie in the closed unit disk .",
    "is it true that there exists a critical point in every disk of radius one centered at a zero of @xmath0 ? _ the conjecture was included in the 1967 book of research problems collected and edited by w. hayman @xcite .",
    "the conjecture was wrongly attributed to ilieff , who in fact only had communicated the problem to the world of mathematicians .",
    "sendov s conjecture naturally fits into the line of classical works on the geometry of polynomials and at the same time it has close connections with potential theory and operator theory , allowing non - trivial matrix theory reformulations . in spite of many ingenious ideas originating in attempts to solve sendov s conjecture ,",
    "only partial results are known today , see for instance the respective chapters in the monographs @xcite .",
    "it was the young julius borcea who pushed the positive solution to this problem up to degree seven @xcite , and it was the mature julius borcea who outlined a series of extensions and modifications of sendov s conjecture in the context of statistics of point charges in the plane .",
    "the authors of the present note had the privilege to work closely with borcea on this topic , individually , and on two occasions in full formation ( generously supported by the mathematics institute at the banff center in canada , and by the american institute of mathematics in palo alto ) . without aiming at completeness ,",
    "the following pages offer a glimpse at borcea s beautiful new ideas .    to understand the present status of sendov s conjecture we outline first the main contributions scattered through its half century history .",
    "in the late 1960s soon after the publication of hayman s book , a series of papers by several authors proved sendov s conjecture for polynomials of degree three , four and five in quick succession .",
    "sendov s conjecture for polynomials of degree six turned out to be significantly more difficult ; its solution in julius borcea s first research paper appeared more than a quarter century later in 1996 @xcite . in his next paper published in the same year",
    ", he proved that the conjecture is true for polynomials of degree seven @xcite .",
    "it is now known that sendov s conjecture holds for polynomials with at most eight distinct zeros @xcite . in the twenty - five years between the proofs for polynomials of degree five and those of degree six , some other special cases of sendov s conjecture of",
    "were solved ; these tended to be classes of polynomials defined by conditions on the geometry of their zeros rather than on their degree .",
    "for instance , sendov s conjecture is true in the following cases :    - all zeros are real @xcite ,    - for all trinomials @xcite ,    - all zeros belong to the unit circle @xcite ,    - all zeros are contained in the closed unit disk , and at least one lies at the center of the disk @xcite ,    - if the convex hull of the zeros form a triangle @xcite .",
    "+ the contents are the following .",
    "we introduce borcea s family of conjectures in the next section .",
    "we verify the @xmath1 version of borcea s conjecture for polynomials with at most three distinct roots in section three and the even stronger @xmath2 version of borcea s conjecture for cubic polynomials in section four .",
    "the connection between these family of conjectures and the theory of univalent functions is explored in section five .",
    "the next three sections detail various operator theoretical approaches to these conjectures and other results in the analytic theory of polynomials . using the logarithmic derivative , it is easy to see that the zeros of the derivative of a polynomial can be viewed as the zeros of the cauchy transform of a sum of point measures at the zeros of the polynomial . in section nine ,",
    "we generalize borcea s conjectures to the zeros of cauchy transform of weighted point measures .",
    "our concluding section is somewhat more speculative ; we look at some very interesting ideas in the mathematical literature which could prove useful for tackling these questions .",
    "since we are interested in the geometry of zeros of a polynomial , it is natural to introduce some quantitative estimates of their relative position in the plane .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 the zero set of a polynomial @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath5 be a polynomial and let @xmath6 .",
    "define the @xmath7-variance of the zero set of @xmath0 by @xmath8 .",
    "certain values of @xmath9 will be of particular importance to us : @xmath10 is the _ variance _ and @xmath11 is called the _",
    "mean deviation_. we define @xmath12 as : @xmath13 and we identify it as the _ chebyshev radius _ of the set @xmath14 ; the optimal value of @xmath15 is known as the _ chebyshev center _ of the set @xmath14 , see for instance @xcite or ample references in the banach space literature @xcite .    for every polynomial @xmath0 and @xmath16",
    "we have @xmath17    let @xmath15 be an optimal center for @xmath18 : @xmath19 in virtue of hlder s inequality : @xmath20^{p / q } n^{1-p / q},\\ ] ] hence @xmath21^{1/p } \\leq [ \\frac{1}{n }   \\sum_k |z_k - c|^q]^{1/q } = \\sigma_q(f)\\ ] ] and the first inequality follows .",
    "the second inequality is obtained similarly , starting with an optimal center @xmath15 with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "recall that in the case of variance @xmath23 the optimal center is the _ barycenter _ of the zeros of @xmath0 @xmath24 indeed , the reader can verify with basic inner space techniques that @xmath25    note also that in the above definitions we allow multiple roots , so that @xmath26 really depends on the polynomial @xmath0 rather than its zero set @xmath14 , although in the literature one also finds the notation @xmath27 .",
    "only @xmath28 is intrinsic to @xmath14 .",
    "we define @xmath29 to be the unsymmetrized _ hausdorff distance _ between the zero sets @xmath14 and @xmath30 : @xmath31 while @xmath32 is the symmetrized hausdorff distance between the the two sets .",

    "assume that @xmath39 .",

    "thus @xmath60 showing that conjecture [ main ] can not be extended to the case @xmath39 .",
    "+ another question which may be of interest is whether asymptotic versions of conjecture [ main ] can be proven . for instance :    [ asymp ] for all @xmath61 , there exists @xmath62 with @xmath63 such that @xmath64 provided @xmath65 .",
    "the case @xmath36 was validated in @xcite by the value @xmath66 .    to a polynomial @xmath67 with derivative @xmath68 we associate the _ discriminant _ : @xmath69 and the _ resultant _ : @xmath70 the fundamental relation between the two is : @xmath71 the proof of this identity follows from the observation that @xmath72    when all points are in the closed unit disk , the maximum value of the discriminant is attained for @xmath73 , for which we get @xmath74 ( equivalently , equally spaced points are fekete points for the disk ) .",
    "thus we immediately obtain that if all the zeros @xmath75 of the polynomial @xmath0 are in the unit disk , then the zeros @xmath76 of @xmath77 must satisfy @xmath78 thus we infer that is further than @xmath12 from @xmath14 can not be in the convex hull of @xmath14 .",
    "see also proposition 4.1 . ]",
    "that sendov s conjecture is true for at least one zero of @xmath0 and a little more : there exists a zero of @xmath0 with the property that the product of all distances to the critical points of @xmath0 is less than or equal to @xmath79 .",
    "the rest of the present article focuses on conjecture [ main ] in the two most important cases @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
