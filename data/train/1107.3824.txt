    "there are several natural questions that one may raise about rational curves on an algebraic variety @xmath0 : is there a rational curve on @xmath0 ?",
    "are there infinitely many ?",
    "are there a lot of rational curves on @xmath0 , that is to say , for example , do the rational curves on @xmath0 cover an open dense subset ? here we will be concerned with the following question : given an algebraic variety @xmath0 possessing a lot of rational curves ( for example , a rational variety ) is it possible to give a quantitative estimate of the number of rational curves on it ?",
    "we expect of course an answer slighly less vague than : the number is infinite .    to give a more precise meaning to the above question ,",
    "let us assume from now that @xmath0 is projective and fix a projective embedding @xmath1 ( or , if you prefer and which amounts almost to the same , an ample line bundle @xmath2 on @xmath0 ) . then being given a morphism @xmath3 we define its degree ( with respect to @xmath4 ) by @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) .",
    "this is a nonnegative integer .",
    "we know from the work of grothendieck ( _ cf .",
    "_   @xcite ) that for any nonnegative integer @xmath7 there exists a quasi - projective variety @xmath8 ( or @xmath9 ) parametrizing the set of morphisms @xmath10 of @xmath4-degree @xmath7 . assuming that @xmath0 is defined over a field @xmath11 , recall that this mean in particular that for every @xmath11-extension @xmath12 there is a natural @xmath13-to-@xmath13 correspondence between the set of @xmath12-points of @xmath8 and the set of morphisms @xmath14 of @xmath4-degree @xmath7 .",
    "thus we obtain a sequence of quasi - projective varieties @xmath15 and we can raise the ( still rather vague ) question : what can be said about the behaviour of this sequence ?",
    "note that one way to understand this question is to specialize the latter sequence to a numeric one , and consider the behaviour of the specialization .",
    "there are several natural examples of such numeric specializations .",
    "for instance we can consider the sequence @xmath16 obtained by taking the dimension , or , if @xmath11 is a subfield of the field of complex numbers @xmath17 , the sequence @xmath18 , where @xmath19 designates the euler - poincar characteristic with compact support ; if @xmath11 is finite , one can also look at the number of rational points , _",
    "i.e. _  the sequence @xmath20 .    the study of the latter sequence is a particular facet of a problem raised by manin and his collaborators in the late 1980 s , namely the understanding of the asymptotic behaviour of the number of rational points of bounded height on varieties defined over a global field ( see _ e.g. _",
    "the degree of the morphism @xmath21 may be interpreted as the logarithmic height of the point of @xmath22 determined by @xmath23 .",
    "the sequence @xmath15 depends on the choice of @xmath4 ( or @xmath2 ) , nevertheless there is a simple way to get rid of this dependency : let us introduce indeed the _ intrisic degree _",

    "bundle @xmath2 one has a finite decomposition @xmath30 now instead of considering the asympotic behaviour of the sequence @xmath31 for a particular choice of @xmath2 , one could study the behaviour of @xmath32 when @xmath29 becomes large , the latter condition needing of course to be more precisely stated .    before explaining the expected behaviour of the previously introduced sequences , we make a few remarks about possible generalizations of the problem .",
    "none of them will be considered in these notes .",
    "first it is possible to raise analogous questions for varieties defined over @xmath33 , not only over @xmath11 . in more geometric words , instead of considering only constant families @xmath34 , one could look at families @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a non empty open subset of @xmath37 , and rational sections of them .",
    "another natural generalization would be of course to replace @xmath37 by a curve of higher genus .",
    "let us stress that most of the results described in these notes extend without much difficulty to the higher genus case .",
    "it is also possible to consider higher - dimensional generalizations of the problem , see _ e.g. _  @xcite .",
    "i thank ana - maria castravet for interesting remarks and comments about the content of this section .",
    "we retain all the notations introduced in the previous section . when the base field @xmath11 is finite , batyrev , manin , their collaborators and subsequent authors made precise predictions about the asymptotic behaviour of the sequence @xmath38 .",
    "let us explain how batyrev links these predictions to some heuristic insights on the asymptotic geometric properties of the varieties @xmath32 ( over an arbitrary field @xmath11 ) .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to varieties @xmath0 for which the following hypotheses hold :    [ hyps : x ] @xmath0 is a smooth projective variety whose anticanonical bundle @xmath39 is ample , in other words @xmath0 is a fano variety .",
    "the geometric picard group of @xmath0 is free of finite rank and the geometric effective cone of @xmath0 is generated by a finite number of class of effective divisors is zero , it is true , that the hypotheses on the picard group and on the effective cone automatically holds for a fano variety , the latter property being highly non trivial . ] .",
    "recall that the effective cone is the cone generated by the classes of effective divisors",
    ". we will be mostly interested in the case where @xmath40 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we will assume in this section that the class @xmath41}$ ] has index one in @xmath42 , that is , @xmath43}\\in d\\,\\operatorname{pic}(x)\\}=1 $ ]",
    ". then a nave version of the predictions of manin et al .",
    "is the asymptotic @xmath44 here and elsewhere @xmath45 will always designate a positive constant ( whose value may vary according to the places where it appears ) .",
    "there is also a version when @xmath39 is replaced by any line bundle @xmath2 whose class lies in the interior of the effective cone ( in other words , a so - called _ big _ line bundle ) , about which we will say a few words below .",
    "we call it a nave prediction since it was clear from the very beginning that could certainly not always hold because of the phenomenon of accumulating subvarieties",
    ". one of the simplest relevant examples is the exceptional divisor of the projective plane blown - up at one point .",
    "one can check that with respect to the anticanonical degree most of the morphisms @xmath21 factor through the exceptional divisor is the following fact : the components of @xmath46 of maximal dimension contain only morphisms which factor through @xmath47 ; this can be easily seen using the toric structure of @xmath0 and the results described in the next part of this text . ] .",
    "thus one is led to consider in fact the sequence @xmath48 where @xmath36 is a dense open subset of @xmath0 and @xmath49 designates the open subvariety of @xmath46 parametrizing those morphisms @xmath10 of anticanonical degree @xmath7 which do not factor through @xmath50 .",
    "similarly , one defines @xmath51 for every @xmath52 .",
    "now the correct prediction should be that holds for @xmath53 if @xmath36 is a sufficiently small open dense subset of @xmath0[multiblock footnote omitted ] .    in order to ` explain geometrically ' the prediction",
    ", batyrev makes use of the following heuristic :    [ heur : bat ] a geometrically irreducible @xmath7-dimensional variety defined over a finite field @xmath11 has approximatively @xmath54 rational points defined over @xmath11 .",
    "of course there is the implicit assumption that the error terms deriving from this approximation will be negligible regarding our asympotic counting problem .",
    "this heuristic may be viewed as a very crude estimate deduced from the grothendieck - lefschetz trace formula expressing the number of @xmath11-points of @xmath0 as an alternating sum of traces of the frobenius acting on the cohomology groups .",
    "it is also used by ellenberg and venkatesh in a somewhat different counting problem , see @xcite .",
    "the next crucial ingredient of batyrev s heuristic is the classical result from deformation theory of morphisms @xmath10 saying that every component of @xmath55 has dimension greater than or equal to the ` expected dimension ' @xmath56 ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "let us choose a finite family of effective divisors of @xmath0 whose classes in @xmath42 generate the effective cone of @xmath0 and let @xmath36 be a dense open set of @xmath0 contained in the complement of the union of the support of these divisors .",
    "then any morphism @xmath10 which does not factor through @xmath50 has an intrisic degree @xmath29 such that @xmath57 for every effective class @xmath58 , in other words @xmath29 belongs to the dual @xmath59 of the effective cone .",
    "for any algebraic variety @xmath60 , let us denote by @xmath61 the number of its geometrically irreducible components of dimension @xmath62 .",
    "assuming that @xmath63 is asymptotically constant , that the dimension of @xmath55 coincides with the expected dimension , and that the above heuristic applies , the number of @xmath11-points of @xmath49 can be approximated by @xmath64 and we will see in section [ subsec : sens ] that we have the asymptotic @xmath65 thus the above geometric assumptions on the varieties @xmath55 together with the adopted heuristic are compatible with manin s prediction . thus , as pointed out by batyrev , it should be interesting to study the asympotic behaviour of @xmath28 in terms of dimension and number of components .",
    "for example , one may raise the following questions .",
    "[ ques : bat ]    1 .",
    "does there exist a dense open subset @xmath36 of @xmath0 such that for any @xmath66 with @xmath67 large enough , the dimension of @xmath55 is equal to @xmath68 ?",
    "2 .   does there exist a dense open subset @xmath36 of @xmath0 such that for any @xmath66 with @xmath67 large enough , @xmath63 is constant ?    note that the condition @xmath67 large enough may be replaced by the condition @xmath69 large enough for any big line bundle @xmath2 .",
    "note also that if the answer to the above questions is positive , for any big line bundle @xmath2 one should have following [ heur : bat ] the heuristic estimation @xmath70 moreover , as we will explain in section [ subsec : sens ] , the rhs of is equivalent as @xmath71 to @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the codimension of the minimal face of @xmath75 containing @xmath76 ; note that @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "thus one obtains an heuristic prediction for the asympotic behaviour of @xmath79 , which is in fact the general version ( _ i.e. _  not limited to the case of the anticanonical sheaf ) of the prediction of manin et al",
    ". alluded to above .",
    "i thank ana - maria castravet for pointing out to me the following .",
    "let @xmath80 be an irreducible component of @xmath81 .",
    "by @xcite , if the evaluation map @xmath82 is dominant then @xmath80 has the expected dimension .",
    "hence it is clear that for any degree @xmath29 , there is a dense open subset @xmath36 of @xmath0 such that every component of @xmath51 has the expected dimension . but @xmath36 depends a priori on @xmath29 .    nevertheless , when @xmath0 has a dense open subset @xmath36 isomorphic to a homogeneous variety , by using the group action one sees immediatly that for every component @xmath80 of @xmath55 the evaluation morphism @xmath83 is dominant .",
    "hence the answer to the first question is affirmative in this case , provided that @xmath55 is non empty .",
    "more generally , this holds as soon as the subset @xmath84 defined in [ _ op.cit .",
    "_ , proposition 4.14 ] is a dense open subset of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , the first question has an affirmative answer for toric varieties , provided that @xmath55 is non empty .",
    "in the next section , we will prove that the answers to [ ques : bat ] are positive for toric varieties .",
    "the proof does not rely on deformation theory but on the so - called homogeneous coordinate ring .",
    "[ rem : ans : ques : bat ] as indicated just before , later in these notes we will see that the answer to [ ques : bat ] is affirmative for toric varieties .",
    "it is also known to be affirmative for some other particular classes of varieties .",
    "if @xmath0 is a homogeneous variety , then for every @xmath85 , the moduli space @xmath28 is irreducible of the expected dimension ( independent works of thomsen , kim - pandharipande , and perrin , see @xcite ) .",
    "this is also the case for general hypersurfaces of low degree ( harris , roth and starr , see @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath0 is a blowing - up of a product of projective spaces and @xmath36 is the complement of the exceptional divisors , it is shown by kim , lee and oh in @xcite that , under suitable extra numerical assumptions on the degree @xmath29 , @xmath51 is irreducible of the expected dimension .",
    "but now let @xmath0 be the moduli space of stable rank two vector bundles on a curve , with fixed determinant of degree @xmath13 .",
    "this is a fano variety with picard group of rank 1 .",
    "castravet s results in @xcite imply that the answer to the second part of question [ ques : bat ] is negative for @xmath0 if the genus @xmath86 of the curve is even : for any sufficiently small open set @xmath36 , @xmath87 has two components if @xmath88 divides the degree @xmath7 , and one otherwise .",
    "it is perhaps worth noting that the morphisms in the extra component appearing for degrees which are multiple of @xmath88 are generically free , but not very free .    for the counter - example of batyrev and tschinkel to manin s conjecture @xcite , which is a fibration in cubic surfaces , it is likely that the answer to question [ ques : bat ] is also negative .",
    "in the previous sections , some predictions were formulated about the asymptotic behaviour of some particular specializations of the sequence @xmath48 , namely the ones obtained by considering the dimension , the number of geometrically irreducible components of maximal dimension and , in case @xmath11 is finite , the number of @xmath11-points .",
    "one may of course wonder whether there exist predictions for other specializations , for instance the one deriving from the topological euler - poincar characteristic with compact support . concerning the latter , note that it has at least one common feature with the specialization number of points over a finite field : they are both examples of maps from the set of isomorphism class of algebraic varieties to a commutative ring , which are additive in the sense that the relation @xmath89 holds whenever @xmath0 is a variety and @xmath90 is a closed subvariety of @xmath0 , and satisfying moreover the relation @xmath91 .",
    "we call such maps _ generalized euler - poincar characteristic _ , abbreviated in gepc in the following .",
    "we are naturally led to consider the universal target ring for gepc : as a group it is generated by symbols @xmath92}$ ] where @xmath0 is a variety modulo the relations @xmath92}={\\left[y\\right]}$ ] whenever @xmath93 and @xmath92}={\\left[f\\right]}+{\\left[x\\setminus f\\right]}$ ] whenever @xmath90 is a closed subvariety of @xmath0 ( the latter are often called _ scissors relations _ ) .",
    "we endow it with a ring structure by setting @xmath92}{\\left[y\\right]}{\\overset{\\text{{\\tiny{def}}}}{=}}{\\left[x\\times y\\right]}$ ] .",
    "the resulting ring is called the _ grothendieck ring of varieties _ and denoted by @xmath94 .",
    "thus the datum of a gepc with value in a commutative ring @xmath95 is equivalent to the datum of a ring morphism @xmath96 .    for an algebraic variety",
    "@xmath97 we denote by @xmath98}$ ] its class in the grothendieck ring .",
    "now a way to handle ` all - in - one ' every possible specialization of the family @xmath99 deriving from a gepc is to look at the family @xmath100}\\}_{y\\in { \\text{\\textnormal{eff}}}(x)^{\\vee}}$ ] which is thus a family with value in the ring @xmath94 .",
    "let us stress that although this is not obvious at first sight , the knowledge of the class @xmath101}$ ] of an algebraic variety @xmath60 allows also to recover @xmath62 and @xmath61 ( though @xmath102 and @xmath103 are certainly not gepc ) , see below .    a classical and useful tool when dealing with a sequence of complex numbers @xmath104 is the associated generating series @xmath105 .",
    "inded , it is often possible to get informations about the analytic behaviour of the meromorphic function defined by the series , which in turn yields by tauberian theorems informations about the asymptotical behaviour of the sequence itself .",
    "we can try a similar approach in our context by forming , for every big line bundle @xmath2 and every sufficiently small dense open subset @xmath36 , the generating series @xmath106}\\,t^d \\in k_0(\\operatorname{var}_k)[[t]]\\ ] ] whose coefficients lie in the grothendieck ring of varieties .",
    "we call it the _ geometric @xmath2-degree zeta function_. applying a gepc @xmath107 to its coefficients yields a specialized degree zeta function with coefficients in @xmath95 , denoted by @xmath108 . if @xmath11 is finite and the gepc is @xmath109 ( that is , the morphism ` number of @xmath11-points ' ) , we recover the generating series associated to the counting of points of bounded @xmath2-degree / height , which we will name the _ classical @xmath2-degree zeta function_.    it will also be interesting to consider the intrisic degree zeta function , which is a generating series keeping track of the decomposition , from which the various @xmath2-degree zeta functions may be recovered by specialization . first we need some preliminaries about monod algebras .",
    "let @xmath110 be a @xmath111-module of finite rank and @xmath112 be a rational polyedral cone of @xmath110 , that is , @xmath112 is a convex cone in @xmath113 generated by a finite number of elements of @xmath110 .",

    "i.e. _  @xmath114 .",
    "let @xmath95 be a commutative ring .",
    "recall how the @xmath95-algebra @xmath115 $ ] may be defined : it is the set of families @xmath116 endowed with the componentwise addition and the multiplication defined by @xmath117 ; the point is that since @xmath112 is strictly convex there is only a finite number of pair @xmath118 such that @xmath119 .",
    "the element @xmath120 will be written @xmath121 . if @xmath122 is an element of the interior of @xmath123",
    "there is a well defined morphism @xmath124\\to a[[t]]$ ] sending @xmath125 to @xmath126 .",
    "the point is that the level sets @xmath127 are finite .",

    "we can also specialize @xmath130 through various gepc ; note that these specializations commute with @xmath129 .",
    "so far we have given only two examples of gepc , the topological euler poincar characteristic with support compact and the number of @xmath11-rational points when @xmath11 is a finite field .",
    "both of them have of course a cohomological flavour .",
    "it turns out that cohomology theories are a natural reservoir of gepc .",
    "let us content ourselves to describe one particular example : fix a prime @xmath132 distinct from the characteristic of @xmath11 , and a separable closure @xmath133 of @xmath11 . to every variety @xmath0 defined over @xmath11",

    "if @xmath11 is finite , one can recover from this refined poincar polynomial the gepc @xmath109 by applying the trace of the frobenius and evaluating at @xmath146 .",
    "in general , one can recover the number of geometrically irreducible components of maximal dimension from the refined poincar polynomial : indeed , for any algebraic variety @xmath0 , @xmath147 is the dimension of @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is the leading coefficient of @xmath150 .",
    "if the characteristic of @xmath11 is zero , there exists by the work of gillet , soul et al .",
    "a universal ` cohomological ' gepc @xmath151 whose target is the grothendieck ring of the category of pure motives . recalling the construction and the basic properties of this category is beyond the scope of these notes ( see @xcite for a nice introduction ) .",
    "let us simply stress that one of the guiding lines of the theory of motives is that it should be a kind of universal cohomological theory for algebraic varieties , which would allow to recover any classical cohomological theory by specialization .",
    "unfortunately , later in these notes , we will be obliged to work with the specialization @xmath152 rather than with the initial geometric degree function .",
    "though this is certainly inacurrate in many senses , the reader unaware of motives may think of the grothendieck ring of motives as if it was the grothendieck ring of varieties ( localized at the class of the affine line , see below ) .",

    "then the dimension of the subspace set @xmath1119 is @xmath1120    we apply this lemma to the above situation , setting @xmath1121 and @xmath1122 ( hence @xmath1123 and @xmath1124 ) , and we find that under the conditions @xmath1125 we have @xmath1126 our second ` approximation ' will be to assume that holds regardless are satisfied or not .",
    "now for @xmath1127 and @xmath1097 we want to estimate the quantity @xmath1128 we consider the generating series @xmath1129 wich decomposes into an euler product @xmath1130 let us explain what happens in the case @xmath1131 .",
    "it is rather easy to check the identity @xmath1132 thus may be rewritten as @xmath1133 ( recall that @xmath1134 is the hasse ",
    "weil zeta function of @xmath546 ) .",
    "now the first factor of the above expression defines a holomorphic function @xmath90 in the polydisc @xmath1135 for sufficiently small @xmath244 . using cauchy estimates , one obtains the approximation @xmath1136 in case @xmath1137 , an analogous reasoning shows the approximation @xmath1138 where @xmath1139 has an explicit expression as an euler product @xmath1140 , @xmath1141 being a rational function , depending only on the @xmath1142-uple of integers @xmath1143 .    as a third approximation",
    "we will assume that the above estimation is in fact an equality , thus obtaining @xmath1144 recalling that the anticanonical class is given by @xmath1145 , this may be rewritten as @xmath1146 our last approximation will be to drop the conditions @xmath1147 appearing in the summation in expression .",
    "now the main task we are left with in order to show that the answer to question [ ques : fin ] is indeed positive , is to establish that all the above approximations can be justified more rigorously through the introduction of error terms which are indeed @xmath253 controlled .",
    "roughly , this can be done using a regular decomposition of the effective cone analogous to the one used in the toric case , but there is a certain amount of technical subtelties that will not be discussed here ( see @xcite ) .",
    "regarding peyre s refinement of manin s conjecture discussed at the end of section [ subsec : dzf : tv ] , another task is to show that the constant given by the first factor of may be expressed as the tamagawa number @xmath1150 but using properties of @xmath533 and @xmath1151 , the first factor of may be rewritten as the euler product @xmath1152 hence we must check , for every @xmath1153 , the following identity @xmath1154 note that @xmath1155 , hence may be seen as a formal identity between two rational functions in the variable @xmath1156 , which may be checked in a finite amount of time ( recall that we have an explicit expression for the rational functions @xmath1157 ; of course a computer algebra system may be helpful ... ) .",
    "one can also try to exploit the following relation , which holds for every finite @xmath11-extension @xmath12 .",
    "this is a generalization of proposition [ prop : rel : tor ] to the nontoric case , valid for every @xmath11-variety @xmath0 having a finitely generated homogeneous coordinate ring : @xmath1158 here we denote by @xmath1159 the intersection of @xmath387 with the subspace @xmath1160 .",
    "the proof goes along the same line that the proof of proposition [ prop : rel : tor ] and from one may derive a slightly more conceptual proof of ( see @xcite ) .",
    "but to our mind this still does not explain in a satisfactory way why holds , and it would be nice to find a genuine conceptual explanation .",
    "it is interesting to note how very similar arguments provide an answer to question [ ques : bat ] for @xmath0 ( though here the obtained result is also a consequence of @xcite ) .",
    "let us sketch very roughly how this is done : the idea is to study @xmath1161 using the same kind of approximations for as before , one obtains that @xmath1162 may be estimated by @xmath1163 decomposing the sum as an euler product and using dominated convergence and the properties of @xmath1093 and @xmath1164 , one shows that the sum appearing in the previous expression converges to @xmath13 when @xmath1165 . hence (",
    "after , of course , having rigorously justified the approximations ) the limit in is @xmath13 , and standard arguments invoking weil conjectures show that this implies that @xmath51 is geometrically irreducible , of dimension @xmath56 ( this holds for any @xmath66 ) .",
    "one of the key ingredient in the above ( sketch of ) proof of the geometric manin s conjecture for the plane blown up at three collinear points was the property that the homogeneous coordinate ring has only one relation and that there exists @xmath1166 such that the classes of @xmath1167 form a basis of @xmath42 and the relation is linear with respect to the variables @xmath1168 . in some sense , in the context of the approach of our counting problem via homogeneous coordinate ring , this situation might be considered as the simplest one once the case of toric varieties ( for which there are no relations ) has been excluded .",
    "note that along varieties for which the hypotheses hold one finds a lot of generalized del pezzo surfaces whose homogeneous coordinate ring has one relation ( see @xcite for their complete classification ) .",
    "one might hope that the techniques employed may lead to a kind of uniform proof of manin s conjecture for varieties satisfying the above requirements ( see @xcite for a beginning of justification ) , though even under the mere above hypotheses the control of the error terms seems to be a very hard task in general .",
    "one of the main problem is that what was designated in the above sketch of proof by the second approximation does not seem to lead in general to controllable error terms ; a somewhat hidden crucial point in the specific case considered above is that the classes of the divisors @xmath1169 are , in some sense , sufficiently large with respect to the degree of the relation defining @xmath887 .    of course , one could also try to draw inspiration from works dealing with manin s conjecture for generalized del pezzo surfaces in the arithmetic case , such as _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite , for which such large degree conditions do not intervene . but one should notice that in these works the base field is almost always the field of rational numbers and that extending the methods to arbitrary number fields seems to be a quite delicate task . on the other hand ,",
    "though we have not given the details in this survey , the above sketched method generalizes rather easily when @xmath37 is replaced by an arbitrary smooth projective curve .",
