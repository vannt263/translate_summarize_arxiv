    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) represent the final stage of evolution for intermediate mass stars ( 1 - 8 m@xmath2 ) .",
    "a pn consists of an expanding gaseous shell of highly ionized gas that has been ejected by the star during the end of the agb evolution , and a central star that will end as a white dwarf .",
    "the study of pn is very important not only because our sun will end as a pn but also because these objects expel heavy elements like carbon and oxygen producing an enrichment of the interstellar medium .",
    "the lifetime of a pne is about 10@xmath3 years and it is expected that there are 10@xmath3 - 10@xmath4 pne in our galaxy , from which only @xmath11500 have been reported ( @xcite ) .",
    "pne are characterized by exhibiting a variety of shapes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "several observational studies have revealed that most of the pne ( @xmath175@xmath5 ; @xcite ) exhibit asymmetric morphologies that go from elliptical to very collimated outflows .",
    "one of the open questions in this field is to understand the origin of these asymmetries .       .oh and h@xmath0o maser emission in young pne [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "l +    to answer this question we should review the formation process itself in the transition between the agb and pne stages .",
    "after completion of the h and he core burning , the star evolves to the agb . at the top of the agb phase",
    ", the star is surrounded by an expanding envelope of gas and dust ( @xcite ) .",
    "the study of the star in this evolutionary phase is better pursued with radio and infrared telescopes and the presence of neutral atomic and molecular gas in the envelope of the star is common ( e.g @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . for agb stars with oxigen - rich envelopes it is possible to detect maser emission of one or more molecules , such as sio , h@xmath0o and",
    "oh that appear stratified in the envelope ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "as the slow and massive mass loss of the late agb phase stops , the gravity contracts the core heating it up , and the star enters its pn phase , from this moment the maser conditions will disappear in short timescales ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in particular , the water molecules are expected to disappear in a timescale of decades , and only oh masers seem to persist for a considerable time ( @xmath11000 yr ; @xcite ) . in this way",
    "h@xmath0o masers are not expected to be present in a regular pn .",
    "however , two pne ( k3 - 35 and iras 17347 - 3139 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have been found to harbor h@xmath0o and oh maser emission , suggesting that these objects can be in an early stage of their evolution as pne .",
    "recently , two more pne have been reported to exhibit h@xmath0o maser emission and interferometric observations are required to confirm the association ( @xcite ) . in this talk we will present details about the kinematics and polarization of the maser emission in the two confirmed pne : k3 - 35 and iras  17347 - 3139 .",
    "modeling of the oh maser emission in late agb stars has shown that the typically observed double peak profile corresponds , in general , to the blueshifted and redshifted maser components which are coming mainly from the front and the back parts of the envelope , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "we mentioned that after the mass loss stops the oh maser can survive around @xmath110@xmath6 years , then it may be possible to find oh maser emission in very young pne . in the particular case when an ionized region is present , which is the case for young pne , the redshifted oh maser peak component coming from the back , may not be seen because the emission is absorbed by the ionized gas , and only the blueshifted oh peak will be present ( @xcite ) . then a very young pne will have a compact ionized inner part while the outer part of the envelope remains neutral , possibly with oh maser emission .",
    "it is possible to appreciate in several young oh - pne , with known lsr velocities , that the blueshifted oh maser components are the dominant ones ( @xcite ) .",
    "for example , for ngc  6302 the ionized gas has a v@xmath7 ( he 121@xmath8)= @xmath929 km  s@xmath10 ( @xcite ) , while the strong oh 1612 mhz maser emission is blueshifted , arising from a velocity of @xmath940 km  s@xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "several surveys of oh maser emission have being carried out toward pne ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) showing that it is uncommon to observe oh maser emission in pne , with the detection of very few objects ( see table  [ tab : young ] ) .",
    "then , if it is difficult to detect oh maser emission , the detection of h@xmath0o masers in pne is expected to be more rare , however our group have confirmed the detection of two h@xmath0o - pne ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and another two h@xmath0o - pne have been recently detected with the robledo de chavela antenna ( @xcite ) . in table",
    "[ tab : young ] we list the detections of h@xmath0o maser emission in pne .",
    "the first confirmed cases of pne where h@xmath0o maser emission is present and coexistent with oh maser and radio continuum emission are : k  3 - 35 ( @xcite ) and iras  17347 - 3139 ( @xcite ) .",
    "both h@xmath0o - pne are emission line nebulae that exhibit bipolar morphologies at radio wavelengths ( k  3 - 35 : @xcite ; @xcite , iras  17347 : @xcite ) and the h@xmath0o masers are arising from the core of the sources in a torus - like structure ( see figure  [ fig : torus ] ) . in the particular case of k  3 - 35 , there is also h@xmath0o maser emission arising from the tips of the bipolar lobes at 5000 au from the central star ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "bipolar morphologies in these h@xmath0o - pne are also appreciated from optical / ir images ( @xcite ) .",
    "the systemic lsr velocities for these two h@xmath0o - pne , obtained from co observations , are 24@xmath113 km  s@xmath10 for k  3 - 35 ( @xcite ) and @xmath955 km  s@xmath10 for iras  17347 - 3139 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the lsr velocities of the h@xmath0o maser components in these pne appear blueshifted , @xmath1224 km  s@xmath10 for k  3 - 35 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and @xmath1365 km  s@xmath10 for iras  17347 - 3139 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in general , young pne have a very high molecular to ionized gas mass ratio ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the case of k  3 - 35 ,",
    "the ratio of molecular to ionized mass is @xmath12 and the recent detection of hco@xmath14 emission suggests the presence of very high density molecular gas ( @xmath110@xmath4  @xmath15 ) that could be protecting the h@xmath0o molecules from the dissociating radiation of the central star ( @xcite ) .",
    "the bipolar morphology , and the presence of large amounts of neutral molecular gas not only suggest that these objects are young , but also that they have followed a similar evolutionary track corresponding to massive progenitors .",
    "figure  [ fig : torus ] shows radio continuum contour images and the h@xmath0o maser spot positions for k  3 - 35 and iras  17347 - 3139 .",
    "modeling of the h@xmath0o masers was made for a homogeneous disk - like structure fitting each maser spot velocity with an expanding and rotating disk . for k  3 - 35",
    "the model resulted in expanding and rotating velocity values of 1.1 km  s@xmath10 and 3.6 km  s@xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the inclination angle of the disk , between the line - of - sight and the major axis of the outflow , was also derived ( 56@xmath16 ) ( see figure  [ fig : inclination ] ) , which is in agreement with having the north lobe of the outflow blueshifted and the south redshifted .",
    "the estimated radius of the ring is 0@xmath17023 ( @xmath1 100 au ) . for iras  17347 - 3139 it was more difficult to do the modeling since the h@xmath0o masers are interpreted as tracing only one edge of the equatorial disk .",
    "however , in both cases the orientation of the major axis of the rings appears perpendicular to the corresponding outflows , supporting a disk model interpretation ( @xcite ) .    , the @xmath18 noise of the lcp and rcp images , respectively . ,",
    "the detection of magnetic fields in pne is a key parameter to understand the generation of jets and bipolar structures in pne ( see vlemings ; these proceedings ) .",
    "k  3 - 35 is one of the few pne where magnetic fields have been detected ( @xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "the oh 1665 mhz maser emission toward k  3 - 35 , was found to be very highly polarized ( @xmath1950% ) , suggesting the presence of a magnetic field ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the 1665 mhz maser spots seems to be tracing an elongated structure perpendicular to the bipolar outflow , it was proposed that they could be tracing an equatorial magnetic field .",
    "new vla observations of the four oh maser transitions confirmed the strong circular polarization of the oh 1665 mhz emission and assuming that at least one zeeman pair is present , we derived a magnetic field in the line - of - sight of 0.14 mg at a radius of 250 au .",
    "in addition , the oh 1720 mhz transition was clearly detected .",
    "a single oh 1720 mhz feature was previously reported by te @xcite toward k  3 - 35 .",
    "our vla oh observations confirmed the presence of a single feature in the spectrum of the 1720 mhz and also proved that it is associated with the h@xmath0o - pne , since the peak position of the maser feature coincides with the peak of the radio continuum emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is the only one pne where the oh 1720 mhz maser transition has been detected .",
    "a contour image of the oh 1720 mhz from k  3 - 35 in its left and right circular polarizations is shown in figure  [ fig : magnetic ] . assuming that a zeeman pair is present , a magnetic field of 0.8 mg was derived at a radius of 120 au .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field in k  3 - 35 is in agreement with the values derived toward evolved stars .",
    "the presence of h@xmath0o and oh maser emission in pne is not common , and their detection suggest that these objects are in a very early phase of their evolution . in particular the presence of h@xmath0o maser emission has been confirmed only in two pne ( k  3 - 35 and iras  17347 - 3139 ) , and from a recent h@xmath0o survey , made with the robledo de chavela antenna , two more pne seem to be detected .",
    "the h@xmath0o maser positions in k  3 - 35 and iras  17347 - 3139 show kinematics consistent with masers located in rings . from modeling",
    ", it is derived that in k  3 - 35 there is a rotating and expanding disk perpendicular to the bipolar outflow .",
    "there is evidence of magnetic fields in k  3 - 35 that could help to constrain the models for jets and bipolar morphologies in pne ."
