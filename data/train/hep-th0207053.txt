    "<S> we construct a positive constant curvature space by identifying some points along a killing vector in a de sitter space . </S>",
    "<S> this space is the counterpart of the three - dimensional schwarzschild - de sitter solution in higher dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> this space has a cosmological event horizon , and is of the topology @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes a @xmath2-dimensional conformal minkowski spacetime .    in recent years </S>",
    "<S> people have been paying particular interest on the constant curvature spacetimes . for the case of negative constant curvature space , namely the anti - de sittter ( ads ) space , </S>",
    "<S> it should be mainly attributed to the celebrated ads / cft ( conformal field theory ) correspondence  @xcite , which states that the string or m theory on an ads space times a compact space is dual to a strong coupling conformal field theory residing on the boundary of the ads . for the case of positive constant curvature space , namely the de sitter ( ds ) space , </S>",
    "<S> one of the reasons responsible for the particular interest is that defined in a manner analogous to the ads / cft correspondence , an interesting proposal , which says that there is a dual between quantum gravity on a ds space and a euclidean cft on a boundary of the ds space , the so - called ds / cft correspondence , has been suggested recently  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another reason is that our universe may be an asympotically ds spacetime  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , different from the cases for the asymptotically flat or ads spacetimes , we have not yet a fundamental description of asymptotically ds spacetimes in the sense of quantum gravity : there is presently no fully satisfactory embedding of ds space into string theory  @xcite .    in @xmath3 dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> the ads space has the topology @xmath4 . by identifying points in the universal covering space of the ads space in a some manner , one can construct various spacetimes which are locally equivalent to the ads space . </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that the btz black hole  @xcite just belongs to this kind of spacetime , which is constructed by identifying points along a boost killing vector in a three dimensional ads space . </S>",
    "<S> its counterparts are discussed in four dimensions  @xcite and in higher dimensions  @xcite , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the topology structure of the btz black hole is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes a conformal minkowski spacetime in @xmath7 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> so the topology of the btz black hole is not peculiar , but its higher dimensional counterparts have the topology @xmath8 in the case of @xmath9 dimensions , which is quite different from the usual one @xmath10 . these black holes look strange in the sense that the exterior of black holes is time - dependent and there is no globally defined timelike killing vector in the geometry of these black holes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so it is quite difficult to discuss the thermodynamics associated with the black hole . in spite of </S>",
    "<S> the peculiar feature of the black hole geometry , in @xcite we applied the surface counterterm approach to a five dimensional constant curvature black hole , and obtained the stress - energy tensor of dual conformal field theory . </S>",
    "<S> for other methods to study the constant curvature black holes , see  @xcite .    on the other hand , a @xmath3-dimensional ds space has the topology @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> different from the ads case , the ds space has a cosmological horizon and associated hawking temperature and thermodynamic entropy @xmath12  @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the gravitational constant in @xmath9 dimensions , @xmath15 is the radius of ds space and @xmath16 denotes the volume of a @xmath17-dimensional unit sphere . due to this , it is argued that the ds space should be described by a theory with a finite number @xmath18 of independent quantum states ; the cosmological constant @xmath19 should be understood as a direct consequence of the finite number of states @xmath20 in the hilbert space describing the world  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus a natural consequence is that a necessary condition for a ( coarse - gained ) spacetime to be described by a theory with @xmath20 states is that the entropy accessible to any observer in that spacetime must obey  @xcite @xmath21 according to the  @xmath22 correspondence \"  @xcite , the theory with @xmath20 states may describe the set * all*@xmath23 of spacetimes : the class of spacetimes with positive cosmological constant @xmath24 , irrespective of asymptotic conditions and types of the matter present  @xcite . applying the condition ( [ 1eq1 ] ) to the candidate set * all*@xmath23 , a suggestion named  </S>",
    "<S> n bound \" has been proposed in  @xcite , which in four dimensions states : _ in any universe with a positive cosmological constant @xmath19 ( as well as arbitrary additional matter that may well dominate at all times ) the observable entropy @xmath12 is bounded by @xmath25_. roughly specking , the  </S>",
    "<S> n bound \" means that the observable entropy in the spacetimes with a positive cosmological constant must be less than or equal to the entropy ( [ 1eq1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this  </S>",
    "<S> n bound \" leads naturally to the bekenstein entropy bound of matter in ds spaces  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry of the ds space looks simple , but this space has much non - trivial physics .    similar to the negative constant curvature case , in this note we construct a positive constant curvature spacetime by identifying points along a rotation killing vector in a ds space . </S>",
    "<S> our solutions turns out to be counterparts of the three - dimensional schwarzschild - ds solution in higher dimensions , and have an associated cosmological horizon . </S>",
    "<S> there is a parameter in the solution , which can be explained as the size of cosmological horizon .    </S>",
    "<S> let us begin with the five dimensional case . </S>",
    "<S> a five dimensional ds space can be understood as a hypersurface embedded into a six dimensional flat space , satisfying @xmath26 where @xmath15 is the radius of the ds space . </S>",
    "<S> this ds space has fifteen killing vectors , five boosts and ten rotations . </S>",
    "<S> consider a rotation killing vector @xmath27 with norm @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is an arbitrary real constant . </S>",
    "<S> the norm is always positive or zero . in terms of the norm </S>",
    "<S> , the hypersurface ( [ 2eq1 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath30 from ( [ 2eq2 ] ) we see that when @xmath31 , the hypersurface reduces to a null one @xmath32 while @xmath33 , it goes to a hyperboloid @xmath34 the null surface ( [ 2eq3 ] ) has two pointwise connected brances , called @xmath35 and @xmath36 , described by @xmath37 the hyperboloid ( [ 2eq4 ] ) has two connected surfaces , named @xmath38 and @xmath39 , defined as @xmath40 we plot the ds space in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> each point in the figure represent a pair @xmath41 and @xmath42 with @xmath43 fixed . on the surfaces @xmath38 and @xmath39 , we have @xmath44 , while @xmath45 on the surfaces @xmath35 and @xmath36 of the two cones . </S>",
    "<S> in the region between @xmath12 and @xmath46 , one has @xmath47 , and @xmath48 inside the two cones . </S>",
    "<S> thus an observer located at the surface @xmath38 or @xmath39 can not see events which happen inside the cone with null surface @xmath35 or @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , there does not exist any communication between the inside the cones and outside the cones . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the surface @xmath35 can be regarded as the future cosmological event horizon and @xmath36 as the past one .    identifying points along the killing vector @xmath49 , another </S>",
    "<S> one - dimensional manifold becomes compact and isomorphic to @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we finally obtain a spacetime with cosmological horizon and with the topology @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the penrose diagram of the positive constant curvature spacetime is plotted in fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> similiar to the case of negative constant curvature  @xcite , we may describe the spacetime in the region with @xmath52 by introducing six dimensionless local coordinates @xmath53 , @xmath54 where @xmath55 here the coordinate range is @xmath56 , and @xmath57 with the restriction @xmath58 in order to keep @xmath59 positive . in coordinates ( [ 2eq7 ] ) , the induced metric is @xmath60 which has the same form as the case of negative constant curvature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it should be pointed out here that the coordinates ( [ 2eq7 ] ) and the definition of @xmath59 are different from the corresponding ones in the constant curvature black holes . in these coordinates it is evident that the killing vector is @xmath61 with norm @xmath62 . thus in these coordinates one has @xmath63 on the surfaces @xmath38 and @xmath39 and @xmath64 on the horizons @xmath35 and @xmath36 . with the identification @xmath65 </S>",
    "<S> , the solution has obviously the topology @xmath66 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is trivial to generalize the five dimensional case to other dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> for the case of an arbitrary dimensions ( @xmath67 ) , the ds space is a hypersurface satisfying @xmath68 in a @xmath69-dimensional flat spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> consider a rotation killing vector @xmath70 with norm @xmath71 and identify points along the orbit of this killing vector , we can obtain a positive constant curvature space with the topology @xmath72 . introducing @xmath69 dimensionless coordinates like ( [ 2eq7 ] ) , one has the induced metric @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 .    like the ds space </S>",
    "<S> , we can also introduce schwarzschild coordinates to describe the solution . using local  </S>",
    "<S> spherical \" coordinates @xmath76 defined as @xmath77 where @xmath78^{1/2}$ ] , and the coordinate range is @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , we find that the solution can be expressed as @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 in these coordinates @xmath64 is the cosmological horizon . </S>",
    "<S> this solution is just the counterpart of a five dimensional constant curvature black hole in the schwarzschild coordinates  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the only difference is that @xmath85 there is replaced by @xmath83 here . in three dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding induced metric is @xmath86 after a suitable rescaling of coordinates it can be transformed to usually three - dimensional schwarzschild - de sitter solution  @xcite . in ( [ 2eq14 ] ) , if @xmath87 , it also reduces to the three - dimensional schwarzschild - ds solution .    within the cosmological horizon ds space is time - independent in the static coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> the solution ( [ 2eq13 ] ) looks also static , but it does not cover the whole region within the cosmological horizon , which can be seen from the definition of coordinates ( [ 2eq12 ] ) because they must obey the constraint : @xmath88 ,    as the black hole case , there is a set of coordinates which cover the whole region within the cosmological horizon . </S>",
    "<S> they are  @xcite @xmath89 in terms of these coordinates , the solution is described by @xmath90 where @xmath83 and @xmath91 it can be seen from ( [ 2eq18 ] ) that when @xmath92 , the solution will reduce to the three - dimensional schwarzschild - ds solution ( [ 2eq15 ] ) . therefore the solution we constructed here is the counterpart of the three - dimensional schwarzschild - ds spacetime in five dimensions . further it should be emphasized here that both sets of coordinates ( [ 2eq12 ] ) and ( [ 2eq16 ] ) can be used within the cosmological horizon only . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen from the metrics ( [ 2eq13 ] ) and ( [ 2eq17 ] ) : beyond the horizon the signature of the solution changes . </S>",
    "<S> it is certainly of interest to find a set of coordinates describing the outer region of cosmological horizon .    in @xmath9 dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> the solution is @xmath93 where @xmath94 is still the one given before , and @xmath95 here @xmath96 denotes the line element of a @xmath97-dimensional unit sphere .    </S>",
    "<S> the euclidean sector of the solution can be obtained via the transformation , @xmath98 , in the solution ( [ 2eq17 ] ) . in that case , the line element ( [ 2eq18 ] ) is changed to @xmath99 in order the @xmath100 to describe a regular three - sphere , the @xmath101 must have a range @xmath102 with @xmath103    in the coordinates ( [ 2eq12 ] ) , the euclidean sector of the solution is ( [ 2eq13 ] ) with @xmath104 here @xmath101 has the range @xmath105 with @xmath106 which differs from the value of @xmath107 ( [ 2eq20 ] ) . although the solution expressed in terms of the coordinates ( [ 2eq12 ] ) does not cover the whole interior of cosmological horizon , the euclidean sector of solution is complete in both sets of coordinates ( [ 2eq12 ] ) and ( [ 2eq16 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> further , regarding @xmath107 or @xmath108 as the inverse temperature of the cosmological horizon seems problematic since calculating the surface gravity @xmath109 of the cosmological horizon shows it does not satisfy the usual thermodynamic relation @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , it is of great interest to discuss the thermodynamics associated with the cosmological horizon in the constructed spacetime .    </S>",
    "<S> next we further consider the euclidean solution in the coordinates ( [ 2eq19 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> making a coordinate transformation @xmath111 and @xmath112 , one can find that the euclidean solution ( [ 2eq17 ] ) with ( [ 2eq19 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath113 this is evidently the euclidean solution of de sitter space in the static coordinates with the euclidean time @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath115 has the period @xmath116 , so the solution ( [ e27 ] ) does not describe a regular instanton . </S>",
    "<S> the regular instanton requires the euclidean time @xmath114 has a period @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the solution ( [ 2eq17 ] ) has a conical singularity along the circle @xmath115 if @xmath118 with a deficit angle @xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath120 , the deficit angle is less than @xmath116 , otherwise it becomes negative . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath121 , the solution is regular without any singularity . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is the same as the case of three dimensional schwarzschild - ds solution  @xcite .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> we have constructed a positive constant curvature space by identifying points along a rotation killing vector in a ds space . </S>",
    "<S> this space is the counterpart of the three - dimensional schwarzschild - ds solution in higher dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> also this space can be viewed as corresponding counterpart of the negative constant curvature black hole constructed in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unlike the ds space , the positive constant curvature space constructed in this note has the topology @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> as the ds space , however , it still has a cosmological horizon @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the solution has a conical singularity along the circle @xmath115 if @xmath118 </S>",
    "<S> . it should be interesting to discuss the thermodynamics of cosmological horizon and dual conformal field theory in the spirit of ds / cft correspondence . </S>"
