    "a multitude of evolution problems can be cast in the form of linear flows , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a matrix operator not necessarily hamiltonian . for an initial value @xmath2 , the solution @xmath3 of these systems of linear differential equations requires , as it is well known , the evaluation of the exponential of the operator @xmath1 .",
    "the solution , with a real or an imaginary time @xmath4 , also admits an exact probabilistic representation in terms of a proper collection of independent poisson processes  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have exploited this probabilistic representation to derive exact finite - time solutions of a hamiltonian flow by a monte carlo algorithm  @xcite , as well as analytical results in the long - time limit  @xcite . in the latter approach ,",
    "the hamiltonian operator is decomposed , in a chosen representation , into diagonal and off diagonal parts , the potential and the hopping terms , respectively . on applying a central limit theorem to the rescaled multiplicities of the values assumed by the potential and hopping terms in the configurations visited by the system during its evolution",
    ", we have obtained a simple scalar equation whose solution provides an approximated semi - analytical expression for the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath1 , in the following often called ground - state energy .",
    "the scalar equation derived in  @xcite contains only the first two statistical moments of the potential and hopping multiplicities and suggests that it is a second order truncation of an exact cumulant expansion .",
    "we have obtained this exact cumulant expansion by a large deviation analysis of the relevant probability density  @xcite . in principle , were all the cumulants known , we would be in possession of a scalar equation whose straightforward solution is the exact lowest eigenvalue of @xmath1 . in general , however , only a finite number of cumulants is available so that we have an approximated truncated equation whose level of accuracy depends on the system considered . in some cases ,",
    "the convergence as a function of the number of cumulants is rather fast and the use of the first few cumulants provides results indistinguishable from those obtained by exact numerical simulations , see @xcite for details .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the probabilistic approach  @xcite from a different point of view .",
    "we suppose that the asymptotic probability density of the potential and hopping multiplicities is known and derive an exact equation for the ground state in a closed form , _",
    "i.e. _ not as a series expansion in cumulants .",
    "this formal result is then made concrete by observing that there exists a class of systems whose associated probability density is a multinomial .",
    "in fact , in the case of uniformly fully connected models and for random potential systems we obtain a very simple equation which relates the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath1 , @xmath5 , to that of the hamiltonian operator with zero potential , @xmath6 .",
    "this equation becomes exact in the limit @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the size of the matrix representing @xmath1 , provided that in the same limit @xmath6 diverges , namely a thermodynamic limit .",
    "by reason of the analytical expression found for @xmath9 as a function of @xmath10 , supposed known , the thermodynamic limit of the ground state of the above systems can be exactly characterized .",
    "we realize that , in this limit , a singularity may show up in the solution for @xmath5 and a quantum phase transition takes place .",
    "such a behavior is obtained when the degeneracy , or probability , the name depends on the kind of system we consider , of the lowest potential level vanishes .",
    "we also provide the equation of the critical surface separating the two phases and show that the hopping energy represents an effective order parameter of the transition .",
    "for both the uniformly fully connected models and the random potential systems , the thermodynamic features of the ground state , including the existence of a quantum phase transition , are universal , in the sense that these depend , up to a rescaling by @xmath11 , only on the levels and on the corresponding degeneracies ( probabilities ) of the potential .",
    "in particular , for the random potential systems we obtain a universal behavior independently of the nature of the hopping operator .",
    "this conclusion compares rather well with the results of exact numerical solutions for finite - size systems of quantum particles in one- and two - dimensional lattices .",
    "in fact , independently of the range chosen for the hopping operator , long or first neighbor , and independently of the nature of the particles , hard - core bosons or fermions , in all cases we have a clear tendency toward the universal thermodynamic behavior predicted by our formula .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ ufcm&rps ]",
    "we introduce the uniformly fully connected models and the systems with random potential we deal with in the rest of the paper . in section [ outlinef ]",
    "we summarize our main result , namely a scalar equation whose solution provides the exact ground - state energy of the hamiltonian operator for the above models in the limit @xmath12 .",
    "the proof of this result is given in section [ proof ] . in subsection [ apa ]",
    "we revisit the probabilistic approach in the case in which the asymptotic probability density of the potential and hopping multiplicities is known .",
    "the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath1 is obtained , together with the asymptotic frequencies associated with the potential and hopping multiplicities , as the solution of a general system of equations .",
    "this result is specialized to the case of uniformly fully connected models and to random potential systems in subsections [ ufcm ] and [ rps ] , respectively . in section [ thermolimit ]",
    "we discuss the thermodynamic limit and show its universal behavior and the appearing of a quantum phase transition when the degeneracy ( probability ) of the lowest potential level vanishes . comparisons with exact numerical results obtained for finite - size lattice systems are provided in section [ many-body.discrete ] in the case of random potentials with discrete spectrum and in section [ many-body.continuous ] for a potential with continuous spectrum . the general features and results of our approach",
    "are summarized in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "let us consider a finite set of @xmath8 states labeled by a vector index @xmath13 .",

    "the matrix @xmath20 is the @xmath14 representation of a hamiltonian operator @xmath1 describing a fully connected model , or complete graph .",
    "this can be understood as follows . in general , a linear operator @xmath1 defines the time evolution of the state function @xmath36 of the system according to the equation @xmath37 starting from some given initial condition @xmath38 .",
    "we can always split @xmath1 in two terms , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , such that in the @xmath14 representation the corresponding matrices have , respectively , only off - diagonal and diagonal non vanishing elements . as it is clear from the probabilistic representation of the evolution equation , see @xcite , the off - diagonal terms of @xmath20 are the rates for the transitions @xmath41 between two different states , whereas the diagonal terms represent weights associated with the permanence in the states of the system .",
    "therefore , eqs .",
    "( [ hf]-[vf ] ) describe a system in which all the possible @xmath42 transitions @xmath43 , with @xmath44 , take place with the same rate , namely a uniformly fully connected model .",
    "the other class of models which we will consider in this paper are defined in the following way .",
    "given an arbitrary hopping matrix with elements @xmath45 , the values of the potential matrix @xmath23 are assigned to the states @xmath13 randomly with the probability @xmath46 where , now , @xmath30 is the set of the chosen levels of the potential @xmath32 and @xmath47 the set of the corresponding given normalized probabilities , @xmath48 the choice of @xmath30 and @xmath47 is arbitrary .",
    "the two classes of models described above are , in a sense , complementary to each other .",
    "in fact , for the former we have the particular hopping operator ( [ ef ] ) , which allows uniformly random connections among all the states , and an arbitrary potential operator , whereas for the latter we have an arbitrary hopping operator and random potential levels .",
    "consider first the uniformly random connected models .",
    "for @xmath49 , the lowest eigenvalue of ( [ hf ] ) , which we call @xmath50 , is trivially related to the lowest eigenvalue of the unit matrix and is given by @xmath51 it coincides , up to the factor @xmath21 , with the number of states connected to any state of the system .",
    "similarly , for @xmath32 constant , let say @xmath52 for any @xmath53 , we have @xmath54 .",
    "note that , for the particular value @xmath55 , we get the obvious result @xmath56 .    in the case of an arbitrary potential operator @xmath40 , an expression for @xmath5 is not known . by using the probabilistic approach developed in  @xcite , in this paper we will show that , in the limit @xmath57 , @xmath5 is the unique solution of the following equation @xmath58 or , in terms of the noninteracting energy @xmath6 , @xmath59 it is easy to check that eq .",

    "( [ e1f ] ) , provided that in the same limit @xmath6 diverges .",
    "for these systems , the noninteracting ground - state energy has no more a trivial form like in ( [ e0f ] ) , as it is the lowest eigenvalue of an arbitrary hopping matrix @xmath26 . in this case , @xmath6 must be determined as a separated problem , _",
    "e.g. _ by using monte carlo simulations in the absence of sign problem , or by fourier transformation if @xmath26 represents the hopping operator of a system of independent particles .",
    "it is worth to stress that even if , in general , @xmath5 is given only implicitly by eq .",

    "( [ e1f ] ) may develop a singularity in its derivatives with respect to the potential levels @xmath32 , signaling a two - state quantum phase transition with a frozen phase having zero hopping energy .",
    "these results hold for potentials with both discrete and continuous spectrum .",
    "the derivation of eq . ( [ e1f ] ) follows from an analytical probabilistic approach we have recently developed to analyze the ground state of an arbitrary hamiltonian operator @xmath1 represented by a finite matrix . in subsection [ apa ] we review the basic definitions and results of the above approach referring the reader to @xcite for details .",
    "although in @xcite we have explicitly considered lattice systems , _",
    "i.e. _ the states @xmath13 are lattice configurations with @xmath13 indicating the occupation numbers of the sites , nothing changes if one looks at the states @xmath13 as arbitrary abstract states .",
    "moreover , differently from @xcite , we will assume that the probability density which is the core of our approach is known .",
    "as a result , we will find a formal equation for @xmath5 in a closed form .    in general ,",
    "given an arbitrary hamiltonian matrix @xmath20 , each row @xmath13 of the corresponding hopping matrix @xmath26 has a different number of non zero elements , let say @xmath62 .",
    "we call @xmath62 the number of active links of the state @xmath13 .",
    "when the number of active links of each state are all equal to the maximum value allowed , namely @xmath63 , we recover a fully connected model .",
    "first , we will consider the analytical probabilistic approach in the general case .",
    "applications to the uniformly fully connected models and to the random potential systems will be discussed in subsections [ ufcm ] and [ rps ] , respectively .",
    "given the hamiltonian operator @xmath1 and separated its corresponding @xmath14-representation matrix @xmath20 into the hopping and potential matrices , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , we define a virtual dynamics as follows .",
