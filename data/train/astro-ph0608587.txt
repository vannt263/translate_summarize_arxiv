    "among the so - called ` secondary ' physical mechanisms that re - process the cmb anisotropy , such as gravitational lensing , time delay , and the sunyaev - zeldovich effect , time delay by foreground inhomogeneities in the matter distribution appears to be investigated least . in the recent period a detailed treatment of the problem",
    "was provided by hu & cooray ( 2001 , hereafter hc01 ) , although the general framework for calculating gravitational perturbation effects on the cmb as published in the review of cmb lensing by lewis & challinor ( 2006 ) could also be employed to carry the study further .",
    "in hc01 the authors found an infra - red logarithmic divergence in the variance of the _ absolute _ ( or total ) time delay along a randomly chosen direction to the lss .",
    "they ` renormalized ' this infinity by subtracting the contribution from the ` monopole ' term of the matter power spectrum , corresponding to the removal of a constant uniformly across the sky .",
    "nevertheless , the remaining ( finite ) quantity still carries the divergence trend .",
    "more precisely the variance is dominated by long wavelength fluctuations , prompting hc01 to consider it as an effect of very large coherence length , @xmath9 2 which does not affect our interpretation of the cmb anisotropy , because the net outcome is simply a gentle and arbitrary distortion of the spherical shape of the lss , completely negligible over the size of one ( or a few ) cycles of cmb acoustic oscillations .    the coherence length inferred by hc01",
    "should be viewed with some caution , however , because the large delay excursion of @xmath10 1 mpc / c calculated there , which involved only the _ zeroth _ order term , the path integral of the perturbing potential itself , stems from the part of the matter power spectrum which carries the scale - invariant harrison - zeldovich dependence @xmath11 , i.e. there is a danger that the large coherence length may simply be due to the infra - red divergence of the variance rather than any genuine physical scale in the matter spectrum . to find the coherence length of relevance to the question of cmb anisotropy distortion ,",
    "it is necessary to pursue the perturbation expansion to the next two orders .",
    "not only are both results free from divergences , but also it is only through a comparison of these two terms that the true coherence scale for variations in the _ relative _ delay between two light paths separated by a small angle @xmath12 would become transparent . we shall find that this scale is defined by a physically significant parameter , viz .",
    "the characteristic wavenumber at which departures of @xmath4 from the harrison - zeldovich behavior occurs for the first time .",
    "the consequence is that appreciable distortion of the lss radius , with both amplitudes and wavelengths on par with the dimension of the primary acoustic oscillations at the time of last scattering , can exist in principle .",
    "although in the @xmath13 0 limit the matter power spectrum has the form @xmath11 , the behavior of @xmath4 at large @xmath14 is more complicated than an exponential cutoff .",
    "it is possible , however , to break down _ any _ general @xmath4 into constituent terms , each of the form @xmath15 , and sum up the time delay fluctuation contributions from all the terms , because @xmath4 has the meaning of a variance , i.e. it too is additive .",
    "we may therefore write @xmath16 this empirical representation of @xmath4 is not the same as the more commonly used ones ( e.g. efstathiou , bond , and white 1992 ) but , as shall be seen in section 3 , the exponential form reveals coherent length scales of foreground effects in a transparent way ; in any case , provided our formula for @xmath4 fits the observational data ( see below ) the detailed structure of the terms used to model the spectrum is of no significance .    the resulting value of @xmath17 in eq .",

    "in particular , for the cmb which is emitted from a three dimensional distribution of sources , a varying time delay on simultaneously observed signals from different directions allows _ depth _ to play a role in the problem - as is already explained towards the end of section 3 .",
    "this depth effect can not be reproduced in any way by lensing .",
    "we finally return to the original subject of this paper , viz .",
    "the degree to which time delay by foreground primordial matter re - processes the cmb primary anisotropy . in eq .",

    "( 21 ) , then , one derives the gaussian smoothing width of cmb anisotropy power , due to the @xmath98 perturbation only , as @xmath138 likewise one also derives the width due to the @xmath99 term as @xmath139 the total width @xmath140 at a given @xmath12 is then the quadrature sum of the contributions ( at that value of @xmath12 ) from both the @xmath98 and @xmath99 terms , as in eq .",
    "( 21 ) .    a graph of @xmath141 versus @xmath142 for the @xmath98 , @xmath99 components and their total is shown in figure 5 .",
    "we explained in the end of section 3 that the smoothing kernel for @xmath140 is a one - sided gaussian function in the case of time delay perturbations , i.e. structures on the lss are invariably biased towards having smaller perceived angular sizes irrespective of how time delay may tilt the lss .",
    "specifically the kernel @xmath143 that enters the integrand for the lensed cmb temperature correlation function , viz .",

    "thus , after applying the ( normal ) simplifying procedures of limber approximation and retention of only the isotropic term @xmath147 in seljak s ( a5 ) , one arrives at the lensed correlation function due to time delay @xmath148 which is to be contrasted with eq .",
    "( a7 ) of seljak ( 1996 ) . owing to the smallness of the effect as dictated by the numerical coefficients in eqs .",
    "( 31 ) and ( 32 ) , however , we did not convolve the acoustic peaks according to the recipe of eq . ( 34 ) , because the distortion is completely unnoticeable to be at least 10 % at the center of the first peak . ] .",
    "we can therefore corroborate hc01 , after this comparatively more detailed and specific investigation ( see section 1 ) , by concluding that relative time delay by foreground primordial density fluctuations does not lead to any appreciable changes in the prediction of the standard cosmological model on the cmb acoustic anisotropy .",

    "the total @xmath149 curve , obtained by adding the two dashed lines in quadrature , is shown as the solid line .",
    "note that the @xmath100 mode is ignored because of the smallness of its effect.,width=384 ]",
    "in spite of the feeble acoustic distortion induced by the time delay perturbation of the primordial matter distribution , its effect of biasing the acoustic peaks towards higher values of @xmath0 ( as compared with the values under the scenario of a homogeneous universe ) remains in principle an interesting phenomenon . to illustrate , let us repeat the acoustic smearing computation in the previous section using a kernel @xmath143 as determined by assuming a larger normalization of the matter power spectrum ( than the wmap value of eq .",

    "the consequence , shown in figure 6 , is no longer negligible as before .",
    "the systematic shift of the acoustic peaks towards higher @xmath0 ( or smaller @xmath12 ) is now evident , and tends to force the best - fit model parameters to assume new values - that involve @xmath151 1 in particular .",
    "thus clumping does not just introduce local fluctuations in the metric tensor ( as first noted in section 3 of einstein 1917 ) , they _ can _ mimic space curvature , by altering the mean geometry of space as revealed by the statistical behavior of remotely emitted light along many and varied directions .",
    "the magnitude of this influence is by no means necessarily small : even the value of @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( 35 ) lies well within the perturbation criterion of @xmath152 1 , yet it led to a finite cmb @xmath140 which , for the @xmath98 term of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , is _ not _ @xmath153 1 because it maxmizes at 32.5 % when eq .",
    "( 31 ) is rescaled on the right side according to @xmath154 .    in the light of the above development ,",
    "let us return to the question of why global space as measured by wmap has zero curvature .",
    "it has widely been accepted that inflation solved the flatness problem , but does not answer why @xmath8 is as small as the value in eq .",
    "( 3 ) . which implies an unusually weak scalar - field coupling",
    "this view is still correct , so long as the ` flatness ' is understood as an intrinsic rather than observed property of space , because indeed @xmath8 , no matter what values it assumes , does not alter the mean intrinsic curvature .",
    "but since , as demonstrated in this work , even within the perturbation regime a larger @xmath8 can make an intrinsically flat geometry appear to wmap as , on average , curved , then one must acknowledge that inflation has not explained why the _ observed _ mean curvature is zero .",
