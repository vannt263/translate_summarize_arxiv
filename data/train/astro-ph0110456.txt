    "a very powerful method for probing the history of galaxy clusters is through the observation and analysis of intracluster light ( cf . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "recently , this field has been revolutionized by on - band / off - band [ o  iii ] @xmath0 surveys for planetary nebulae ( pne ) located between the galaxies of fornax and virgo . by searching for emission line objects on ccd frames and adopting reasonable values for the ratio of pne to main sequence stars , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    "all concluded that a substantial fraction ( @xmath10 ) of the stellar mass of these clusters resides outside of any galaxy .",
    "this result , however , is by no means secure . by comparing star counts in a virgo intracluster field with counts performed on the _ hubble deep field , _",
    "@xcite concluded that only @xmath11 of virgo s stellar mass belongs to a diffuse intergalactic component .",
    "in addition , the interpretation of virgo s [ o  iii ] @xmath0 sources as intergalactic planetary nebulae has been called into question by the _ vlt / fors _ spectroscopy of @xcite .",
    "although spectroscopic observations by @xcite appear to confirm that most of the emission line sources identified by @xcite and @xcite are , indeed , [ o  iii ] @xmath0 emitters in nearby intracluster space , the virgo pn candidates observed by kudritzki are all background galaxies .",
    "if most of the emission - lines sources found in the [ o  iii ] surveys are also background galaxies , then many of the conclusions recently reached about intracluster starlight in virgo and fornax are incorrect , and the usefulness of planetary nebula surveys in intracluster space has to be reconsidered .    here",
    "we report the results of two experiments designed to estimate the number of background galaxies expected in surveys of virgo and fornax intracluster planetary nebulae ( ipne ) .",
    "first , we describe spectroscopic observations of five planetary nebulae in the field of m87 that have been labeled by @xcite as `` overluminous '' and therefore foreground to m87 .",
    "we show that a composite spectrum made from these sources contains both [ o  iii ] @xmath0 and [ o  iii ] @xmath5 in the appropriate ratio .",
    "consequently , it is likely that the majority of the overluminous objects in this field belong to the cluster .",
    "we then report the results of a 0.13 deg@xmath7 on - band / off - band photometric survey at 5019    of a `` blank field '' set well away from any nearby galaxy or cluster .",
    "we show that , although the density of `` pn - like '' sources in the field is not negligible , it is still five times smaller than the density derived for [ o  iii ] sources in virgo .",
    "thus , surveys for intracluster pne remain a viable method for measuring the amount of stars stripped out of galaxies .",
    "finally , we discuss the nature of the contaminating objects , and , using arguments based on emission line equivalent widths , conclude that most of these sources are emission - line galaxies at @xmath12 .",
    "our results support the conclusions of @xcite that ly@xmath3 galaxies with monochromatic fluxes of @xmath13  ergs  @xmath14  s@xmath15 and observed equivalent widths greater than 80     are fairly common , although the density we derive is only one - half the hu value .",
    "in their on - band / off - band [ o  iii ] @xmath0 survey of planetary nebulae in the field of m87 , @xcite found that the planetary nebula luminosity function ( pnlf ) of the galaxy is distorted relative to the pnlfs of other galaxies .",
    "specifically , in the outer part of the galaxy , m87 s pnlf does not have a sharp cutoff at its bright end ; instead , the galaxy appears to contain a population of `` overluminous '' objects that are up to @xmath16  mag brighter than the pne seen in other galaxies . because the number of these overluminous pne scales with the survey area , and not galactic surface brightness , ciardullo concluded that these bright [ o  iii ] @xmath0 sources are not associated with m87 . instead",
    ", ciardullo hypothesized that the overluminous pne belong to the virgo cluster as a whole , and are projected up to @xmath17  mpc in front of m87 .    to test this hypothesis",
    ", we used the _ hydra _ multi - fiber spectrograph on the kitt peak _ wiyn _ telescope to obtain spectra of some of the overluminous pn candidates .",
    "our specific spectrograph setup included _",
    "hydra s _ 2-arcsec red sensitive fiber cables , the bench spectrograph s 285 mm focal length camera , a site @xmath18  ccd detector ( 4.3  e@xmath19 readnoise , gain of 1.7  e@xmath19  adu@xmath15 ) , and an 860  lines  mm@xmath15 grating blazed at @xmath20 . when used in second order ,",
    "this grating - camera - detector combination yielded spectra with a dispersion of 0.47    pixel@xmath15 and a resolution of 0.77    over the wavelength range between 4500    to 5500   .",
    "the total observation time for the setup was three hours ; to facilitate the removal of cosmic rays , the observations were split into three one - hour exposures .",
    "nine objects with monochromatic [ o  iii ] @xmath0 fluxes greater than @xmath21  ergs  @xmath14  s@xmath15 ( @xmath22 ) were chosen for study .",
    "since m87 s pnlf cutoff occurs at @xmath23 @xcite , these pn candidates are all significantly `` overluminous '' ( by @xmath24 ) with respect to the galaxy , and can be interpreted as foreground intracluster stars . unfortunately , due to a combination of factors , including astrometric and fiber - positioning errors , only five of the emission - line objects were detected .",
    "the multifiber spectra were extracted , flatfielded , and wavelength calibrated using the iraf package dohydra . a flatfield image taken at the beginning of the night served as the reference for tracing the spectra on the ccd frame ;",
    "the wavelength calibration was performed using copper - argon comparison arcs taken before and after the exposure sequence .",
    "sky subtraction was accomplished using the summed spectra of 49 sky fibers randomly placed around the galaxy .",
    "since the sky in this wavelength region is faint and our observations were taken at moderately high ( @xmath25 ) resolution , our results are independent of the accuracy of this subtraction .",
    "the overluminous pn candidates are listed in table  1 , using the identification numbers of @xcite .",
    "figure  1 displays the recorded spectra in the wavelength region between 4940    and 5060   .",
    "as the figure illustrates , the signal - to - noise of the spectra is extremely low ; in all cases , we have only a bare detection of a single , unresolved emission line .",
    "the fact that the emission lines are unresolved does suggest that the objects are virgo pne , rather than background galaxies ( or quasars ) , since the velocity widths of the latter objects would likely be greater than our @xmath26  resolution .",
    "however , for any individual object , this possibility can not be excluded .",
    "nevertheless , we can use the procedure of @xcite to _ statistically _ show that the detected emission line is [ o  iii ] @xmath0 . to do this ,",
    "we start by assuming that the identification of [ o  iii ] @xmath0 is correct , and then shift each spectrum back into its rest frame .",
    "we then scale the data so that all the @xmath0 lines have equal weight , and co - add the spectra to create a single composite spectrum . this spectrum is displayed in figure  2",
    ". as the figure illustrates , the increased signal - to - noise brings out an additional feature : [ o  iii ] @xmath5 .",
    "if all five overluminous objects are indeed , intergalactic pne , then this companion line should be @xmath27 the strength of @xmath0 ; if some of the objects are background galaxies , then the line ratio should be reduced by the fraction of contaminants .",
    "the ratio of @xmath5 to @xmath0 in figure  2 is @xmath28 , where the quoted error represents our estimate of the measurement uncertainty , and neglects factors associated with the changing efficiency of the spectrograph .",
    "since this number is extremely close to @xmath27 , it is likely that all of the overluminous @xmath0 sources are planetary nebulae : at most , only one of the five objects can be a contaminant .",
    "moreover , since the sources are too bright to be pne associated with m87 , the best hypothesis remains that these objects belong to the virgo cluster as a whole , and are located on the near side of the cluster .",
    "an alternative method of determining the importance of contamination in ipne surveys is through the analysis of a control region . by measuring the surface density of point - like emission - line sources in the field",
    ", we can directly estimate the amount of contamination expected in cluster surveys . to perform this `` blank field '' experiment , we chose a high - latitude ( @xmath29 ) location in the southern hemisphere , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "this region of sky is located well away from any nearby cluster : it is @xmath32 from the center of fornax , and @xmath33 from the nearest ( small ) galaxy in the tully catalog @xcite . aside from one faint radio source ( pmn j0401@xmath343944 ; *",
    "* ) and one @xmath35 quasar ( osmer 14 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) no remarkable objects are known to be located within the @xmath36 field of our camera .    according to the h  i and galaxy count data of @xcite , the foreground galactic reddening in the region",
    "is @xmath37 ; from the dirbe / iras data of @xcite , this number is @xmath38 . for simplicity , in this paper",
    "we assume that the extinction is identically zero .",
    "we observed the blank field on the nights of 1998 nov 20 , 21 , 22 , and 23 with the big throughput camera ( btc ) on the cerro tololo 4-m telescope .",
    "this mosaic ccd system consists of a square array of four @xmath18 tektronix ccds , each of which has a readnoise of @xmath39  e@xmath19 , a gain of 2.4  e@xmath40  adu@xmath15 and a scale of @xmath41 per pixel .",
    "the total area included on all four chips is 0.23 deg@xmath7 , but due to the dithering procedure used to improve the flatfielding , the actual area surveyed was only 0.215 deg@xmath7 .",
    "when we exclude the data of ccd  # 2 , which has a slightly lower ( but highly variable ) quantum efficiency , and eliminate the areas around saturated stars and bad pixels , our effective survey region is further reduced to 0.13 deg@xmath7 . still , this is over six times larger than that of the deep , narrow - band ly@xmath3 surveys of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the on - band filter used for our experiment was the [ o  iii ] # 2 mosaic filter of kitt peak ; this filter has a central wavelength of 5019  and a full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 55    at ambient temperature in the converging beam of the telescope .",
    "the off - band filter was kitt peak mosaic filter [ o  iii]+29 , whose central wavelength and fwhm are 5305  and 241   , respectively .",
    "the total on - band exposure time for our four nights of observations was 285 minutes ; this was split into four 1-hr exposures plus one 45-min exposure .",
    "our off - band data consisted of 5 15-min exposures , for a total integration time of 75 min .",
    "all these data were taken under photometric conditions in @xmath42 seeing .",
    "the procedures used to reduce the data , identify emission - line objects , and measure their brightnesses , were identical to those used to search for intracluster planetary nebulae , and are fully described in @xcite .",
    "after de - biasing and flatfielding the data ,",
    "the on - band and off - band frames were co - added to create master images that were clipped of cosmic - rays .",
    "the frames were then searched for pn - like candidates in two different ways using the daophot and phot packages within iraf . the first method involved performing photometry of all point sources on the frames , and constructing a color - magnitude diagram from the results .",
    "objects with highly negative on - band minus off - band colors were flagged as pn - like sources ( cf .",
    "figure  3 ) . in the second method ,",
    "candidate sources were identified by searching for positive residuals on a `` difference image '' made by subtracting a scaled version of the off - band image from the on - band frame .",
    "these two techniques complement each other , in that each detects objects that the other method does not .",
    "because the color - magnitude algorithm is susceptible to confusion by continuum sources near target objects ( blends ) , the former analysis misses @xmath43 of the emission - line sources , even at bright magnitudes .",
    "conversely , the subtraction technique detects virtually all the bright emission - line objects , but loses some of the fainter sources due to the larger noise of the difference frame . as we describe below , these two techniques , coupled with our chosen detection threshold for daofind , optimized our our ability to detect real emission - line sources , and kept the number of false detections at a manageable level .    after analyzing our on - band / off - band frames with both methods ,",
    "a series of routines were run to purge the candidate list of false detections .",
    "first , we removed objects which fell within the excluded regions around saturated stars and near bad pixels .",
    "we then ignored all objects for which the final final detected signal - to - noise was less than four ; such objects are almost always random noise fluctuations ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . finally , we removed probable cosmic rays from our list by going back to the individual exposures which created the master on - band frames . using apertures of the order of the seeing fwhm , we measured the magnitude of each candidate object on each individual frame .",
    "if , after correcting for sky transparency , one of the measurements was @xmath44 higher than the mean determined from the magnitudes on the other four frames , the object was deleted from the analysis .",
    "once the false detections and cosmic rays were eliminated , the remaining pn - like candidates were screened by eye to create the final list of @xmath8 sources . to be included in the list ,",
    "an object had to be spatially unresolved on the on - band image , and completely invisible on the off - band frame .",
    "a total of nine such `` pn - like '' objects were found by our procedure .    to confirm the robustness of our algorithms",
    ", we tested our results in three different ways .",
    "first , we added artificial stars to the on - band ( but not the off - band ) image using the addstar task within daophot .",
    "we then ran our detection algorithms , and computed the fraction of objects recovered as a function of magnitude . since our algorithms can work no better than that of the star - finding algorithm ( daofind ;",
    "* ) , this analysis places a limit on the effectiveness of the search .",
    "the result of this simulation for one of the btc ccds is shown in figure  4 .",
    "as the figure illustrates , we are 90% complete down to an instrumental magnitude of @xmath45 , and 50% complete to @xmath46 . for consistency with other planetary nebula surveys ,",
    "we adopt the 90% completeness limit , which is equivalent to a signal - to - noise of nine @xcite , as this survey s limiting magnitude .    as a second test",
    ", we ran our automated detection algorithms on frames of the virgo cluster that had been visually blinked as part of previous surveys for intracluster planetaries @xcite .",
    "our new algorithms recovered all of the pn candidates above the daofind completeness limit and 92% of all the previously known sources .",
    "finally , two of us ( j.j.f . and k.k . ) independently blinked one of the btc ccd fields by eye , and compared our results to those of the automated algorithm . in both cases ,",
    "all objects brighter than @xmath47 that were found by eye were also recovered by the computer .",
    "we are therefore confident that our detection scheme is the best possible for finding faint emission - line sources in a blank field .",
    "once the objects were found , their equatorial positions were derived with respect to the reference stars of the usno - a 2.0 astrometric catalog @xcite .",
    "the measured residual of our plate solution was @xmath48 , a number slightly less than the @xmath49 external error associated with the catalog . on - band and",
    "off - band photometry was accomplished relative to bright field stars via the aperture photometry routines within iraf . these data",
    "were then placed on the standard ab system by comparing large aperture measurements of field stars with similar measurements of the @xcite and @xcite spectrophotometric standards feige  110 , ltt  1020 , ltt  3218 , eg  21 , and ltt  2415 . the dispersion in the photometric zero point computed from these stars was @xmath50  mag .",
    "finally , we converted the on - band ab magnitudes to @xmath0 monochromatic fluxes using the techniques outlined in @xcite , under the assumption that the wavelength of the detected emission line lies near the bandpass center of the interference filter .",
    "for consistency with papers on extragalactic planetary nebulae , we define @xmath51 where @xmath52 represents monochromatic flux in ergs  @xmath14  s@xmath15 .",
    "when placed on this standard system , the instrumental completeness limit of @xmath47 corresponds to an ab magnitude of @xmath53 , or a @xmath0 magnitude of @xmath54 .",
    "a similar analysis for the continuum frame reveals that the limiting ab magnitude of our off - band data is @xmath55 .",
    "coupled together , these two numbers imply that our @xmath0 survey should be complete to a monochromatic flux of @xmath56  ergs  @xmath14  s@xmath15 , which corresponds to an equivalent limit of @xmath57    in the observer s frame .",
    "those objects which , had they been located in a cluster environment , would have been mistaken for intracluster planetary nebulae , are listed in table  2 .",
    "all the detected point - sources have _ extremely large _ equivalent widths : the smallest value is 212   , and the median equivalent width is 273   .",
    "these numbers are far above our detection threshold of 82   , and demonstrate that the number of pn - like sources in the blank field is not sensitive to this quantity . the most important feature of the table",
    ", however , is its rather small number of objects .",
    "only nine point sources brighter than our limiting magnitude of @xmath54 were detected in the 0.13 deg@xmath7 region .",
    "this compares to nine objects brighter than @xmath58 in the lowest density virgo field observed by @xcite . considering that the feldmeier field is less than half the area of this survey , the data imply that surveys for intracluster pne are a viable way to probe the distribution of intracluster starlight .    the results , however",
    ", do suggest that some of the recent conclusions about intracluster stars in virgo and fornax may be incorrect .",
    "for example , @xcite used the apparent luminosity of virgo s brightest [ o  iii ] @xmath0 sources and the planetary nebula luminosity function , to place an upper limit on the distance to the front edge of the system .",
    "their distance of @xmath59  mpc implied that virgo is extremely elongated along the line - of - sight . based on our blank field study ,",
    "it is clear that field objects with large equivalent widths and line fluxes as large as @xmath60  ergs  @xmath14  s@xmath15 do exist , and can be mistaken for intracluster planetaries .",
    "thus , structural analyses that depend on one or two extremely bright objects may be incorrect .",
    "in the case of the m87 field , the spectroscopy of section  2 demonstrates that the intracluster environment is indeed elongated : since the absolute magnitude of the [ o  iii ] @xmath0 pnlf bright - end cutoff is @xmath61 @xcite , the apparent magnitudes of table  1 imply that the front side of virgo is no more distant than 12.8  mpc ( @xmath62  mpc in front of m87 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "unfortunately , without spectroscopy , similar limits can not be placed on other regions of the cluster .    to quantify the fraction of contamination expected ,",
    "table  3 compares the density of intracluster [ o  iii ] sources detected in fields 2 - 6 of @xcite to the results of this blank field experiment .",
    "the limiting magnitudes of the feldmeier fields are generally not as deep as the data presented here ( @xmath63 ) , so the virgo results have been extrapolated to a depth of @xmath64 using the standard form of the pnlf : @xmath65\\ ] ] although the contamination rate fluctuates from field to field , table  3 demonstrates that @xmath9 of the emission - line objects found by feldmeier are likely to be interlopers . unfortunately , it is difficult to define this fraction more precisely . due to the small number of objects detected in the blank field survey ,",
    "the derived contamination rate is uncertain by at least 33% .",
    "moreover , if the contaminating sources are , indeed , extragalactic background objects , some field - to - field fluctuation might be expected to arise from large - scale structure . nevertheless , our photometrically derived contamination fraction is in good agreement with the value of 26% determined via spectroscopy of individual ipn candidates @xcite .",
    "a @xmath66% contamination rate , coupled with the distribution of magnitudes given in table  2 , explains why @xcite found a large fraction of contaminants in their spectroscopic survey , but @xcite did not . from the table , it is apparent that there are more faint emission - line sources in our blank sky field than bright sources .",
    "a maximum - likelihood analysis of the nine data points suggests that , in the magnitude range @xmath67 , a power - law @xmath68 , with slope @xmath69 adequately represents the differential source counts .",
    "if this behavior continues to fainter magnitudes , then the apparent discrepancy between the results of kudritzki and freeman is simply a function of which objects the authors chose to observe . of the nine objects observed by kudritzki et al .",
    ", two are extremely bright , with [ o  iii ] @xmath0 magnitudes more than 0.7  mag brighter than the nominal pnlf cutoff .",
    "since the pnlf s decline at bright magnitudes is extremely rapid , blank field sources dominate at these magnitudes .",
    "moreover , four of the kudritzki targets are extremely faint , with @xmath70 . in this regime",
    ", the slope of the pnlf has reached its limiting value of 0.133 .",
    "since this number is @xmath71 times shallower than the background source count slope , a significant amount of contamination is again expected . between these two extremes , however , the density of background objects is much less than the density of ipne , and it is this range that freeman performed their observations .    if we adopt a slope of @xmath72 for the luminosity function of the background objects , and normalize the counts so that the background contributes @xmath9 of the @xmath67 sources in virgo s intracluster space , then by @xmath73 , the density of interlopers is more than half that of the intracluster stars .",
    "of course , this result depends sensitively on the extrapolated slope of the background source counts .",
    "nevertheless , because the faint - end slope of the pnlf is shallow , we can expect that at some point past @xmath74 , the background sources will overwhelm the planetaries .",
    "our estimate of the contamination rate moves pn - based measurements of virgo s intracluster stars into better agreement with that determined from _ hst _ red giant star counts @xcite .",
    "however , because the vast majority of pn candidates brighter than @xmath54 are still likely to be genuine , a factor of @xmath75 discrepancy between the two estimates remains . one possible explanation for the difference may be small - scale structure in the distribution of the intracluster stars themselves .",
    "observationally , there is evidence that the ipn are scattered non - uniformly in the virgo cluster @xcite and most theories for the creation of intracluster stars predict that the distribution of such objects should have filamentary structure @xcite .",
    "since the _ hst _ field is much smaller ( @xmath39  sq .",
    "arcmin ) than the ipn fields ( @xmath76  sq .  arcmin ) , it is entirely possible that the difference between the ipn and _ hst _ estimates for virgo s intracluster star population reflect real fluctuations in the stellar background .",
    "to be detected via our on - band / off - band interference technique , an object must have an extremely strong emission line , with an observed equivalent width of @xmath77   .",
    "if the line is not [ o  iii ] @xmath0 , then the two most plausible alternatives are [ o  ii ] @xmath1 at @xmath78 ( rest frame equivalent width @xmath79   ) or ly@xmath3 at @xmath80 ( @xmath81   ) .",
    "the former option is possible , though unlikely .",
    "most of our emission - line sources have putative [ o  ii ] rest frame equivalent widths greater than 150   ; the redshift surveys of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have yet to find such extremely strong [ o  ii ] emitters ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . moreover , if the emission - line sources are really [ o  ii ] galaxies at @xmath78 , then these objects must have absolute magnitudes between @xmath82 .",
    "( the bright limit comes from the limiting magnitude of our off - band frame , while the faint limit is derived from our on - band flux limit of @xmath83  ergs  @xmath14  s@xmath15 and the observed @xmath84    upper limit for [ o  ii ] equivalent widths . )",
    "if we integrate the luminosity function for low - redshift [ o  ii ] emission - line galaxies @xcite between these two limits , and normalize to the volume of space surveyed by our 55    fwhm filter ( @xmath85  mpc@xmath86 at @xmath78 ) , then we find that @xmath87  [ o  ii ] emission line galaxies should lie within our survey region .",
    "since only @xmath88 of faint ( @xmath89 ) [ o  ii ] emission line galaxies have equivalent widths greater than our 60     rest frame survey limit @xcite , the implication is that @xmath90 of our strong emission - line sources is an [ o  ii ] galaxy .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is likely that at least some of our emission - line sources are ly@xmath3 objects . in their spectroscopic follow - up of candidate intracluster planetary nebulae in virgo ,",
    "@xcite found nine such objects .",
    "similarly , in their deep narrow - band and spectroscopic searches of a 75  square arcmin region , @xcite found that ly@xmath3 sources with observed equivalent widths @xmath91    are not rare .",
    "specifically , these authors found that , down to a limiting flux of @xmath92  ergs  @xmath14  s@xmath15 , the density of ly@xmath3 emitters at @xmath93 is @xmath94  deg@xmath95 per unit redshift interval .",
    "since only five out of the twelve emitters tabulated by @xcite have fluxes greater than our detection limit of @xmath83  ergs  @xmath14  s@xmath15 , their observations suggest that we should be able to detect @xmath96 such objects in our survey region .    in order to compare our results to the cowie numbers",
    ", we expanded our search criteria to include both resolved sources and sources detected in continuum . to do this",
    ", we followed the prescription of @xcite and modified daofind s fwhm convolution kernel so that our program could detect non - stellar objects .",
    "we then re - ran our search algorithms on the btc images , and flagged all objects ( both stellar and non - stellar ) with fluxes above the completeness limit and with equivalent widths greater than 82   .",
    "( for objects with no continuum detection , we used the off - band frame s @xmath97 upper limit in our calculation of equivalent width . )",
    "the 12 additional objects found in this search are listed in table  4 , and plotted as open circles in figure  3 .",
    "figure  5 displays the on - band , off - band , and difference images of a sample of our strong line - emitters ( both pn - like and otherwise ) , and finding charts for all the sources listed in tables  2 and 4 are given in figure  6 . in total , we detected 21 strong emission - line sources in our 0.13 deg@xmath7 survey region .",
    "of the 12 additional sources , five are well - resolved with fwhm sizes in the range between @xmath98 and @xmath99 , and another three are marginally resolved .",
    "this size distribution ( 13 point sources , 3 marginally resolved objects , and 5 clearly resolved galaxies ) appears roughly consistent with the distribution of half - light radii observed for lyman - break galaxies ( cf .",
    "* ) . however , higher resolution images are needed to confirm this result .",
    "our surface density , coupled with the @xmath100 bandpass of our filter , implies that the surface density of ly@xmath3 sources with monochromatic fluxes greater than @xmath83  ergs  @xmath14  s@xmath15 is @xmath101  deg@xmath95  per unit redshift interval .",
    "this value is marginally lower ( by @xmath102 ) than the value derived by @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy certainly is not serious , especially since both surveys may be affected by large - scale structure . by counting lyman - break galaxies in @xmath103 regions ,",
    "@xcite has estimated the cell - to - cell variance of @xmath104 lyman - break galaxies to be @xmath105 .",
    "however , the large - scale distribution of ly@xmath3 emitters may be quite different , and significant excursions from the mean are possible .",
    "for example , in their 5-m survey of a 78  square arcmin region of the sky , @xcite detected @xmath106 @xmath107 emission - line sources above our detection threshold .",
    "when scaled to the bandwidth of our @xmath0 filter , their data give a ly@xmath3 galaxy surface density of @xmath108  deg@xmath95 per unit redshift interval , a number almost five times larger than observed here .",
    "however , the steidel survey was directed at a large structure of galaxies , whose volume density is @xmath109 times higher than average .",
    "thus , their result is consistent with our observations .    for an @xmath110  km  s@xmath15  mpc@xmath15 , @xmath111 universe ,",
    "our data imply that the space density of @xmath80 galaxies with ly@xmath3(ew ) @xmath112    and @xmath113  ergs  s@xmath15 is @xmath114  galaxies  mpc@xmath115 . note that these objects are undergoing a significant amount of star formation . if we neglect internal extinction and assume ( as do * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the ly@xmath3 to h@xmath3 ratio of these objects is 8.7 @xcite , then @xmath116  ergs  s@xmath15 in ly@xmath3 corresponds to a star formation rate of @xmath117  yr@xmath15 ( cf .",
    "this implies that all but one of the objects detected in this survey have star formation rates between 1 and @xmath118  yr@xmath15 .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath119 star formation rates derived from the rest - frame uv flux measurements of @xcite .",
    "figure  7 plots the emission - line luminosity function of strong emission - line sources , under the assumption that the objects are , indeed , ly@xmath3 galaxies at @xmath80 .",
    "if we integrate the function over the range displayed in the figure , we obtain a measured star formation rate density of @xmath120  yr@xmath15  mpc@xmath115 . if we then extrapolate the luminosity function to the approximate limiting magnitude of hu using the assumption that the luminosity function flattens past @xmath121  ergs  s@xmath15 in a manner similar to a @xcite function , then the total star formation rate density of emission line galaxies brighter than @xmath122  ergs  s@xmath15 is @xmath123  yr@xmath15  mpc@xmath115 .",
    "this value is roughly one - tenth that derived from lyman - break galaxies @xcite .",
    "our value for the space density of ly@xmath3 emitters and their implied star formation rate density is a factor of @xmath75 smaller than that derived by @xcite . since the hu data are for a slice of the universe at @xmath124 , it is possible to interpret this decrease as being due to evolution .",
    "however , given the small difference in time between these two epochs ( @xmath125  gyr ) and the small number of galaxies detected , it is far too early for such a conclusion .",
    "by studying a blank field located well away from any galaxy or cluster , we have found that surveys for intracluster planetary nebulae are not pristine . at monochromatic fluxes fainter than @xmath126  ergs@xmath95  s@xmath15",
    "there is a non - negligible amount of contamination from field objects .",
    "the most likely source of this contamination is ly@xmath3 galaxies at @xmath4 ; the data therefore suggest that the same techniques that allow 4-m telescopes to map out the distribution of intracluster pne , can be used to determine the distribution of starbursting galaxies at high redshift .",
    "nevertheless , our observations confirm the presence of intracluster pne in virgo .",
    "the amount of background contamination is not nearly enough to explain the number of emission - line sources found in wide - field surveys of virgo ; based on our blank - field data , the contamination fraction is only @xmath9 .",
    "this low number is confirmed by our spectroscopy of candidate intracluster pne in the field of m87 : the presence of [ o  iii ] @xmath5 in a composite spectrum of five `` overluminous '' objects implies that at least four of the objects are true planetary nebulae .",
    "surveys for intracluster planetaries at magnitudes brighter than @xmath127 therefore remain an effective way of probing the dynamical history of nearby clusters .",
