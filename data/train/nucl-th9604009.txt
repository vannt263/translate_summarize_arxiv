    "there has been a growing interest in the study of neutron - rich nuclei since the advent of radioactive nuclear beams .",
    "it was found @xcite that some light nuclei near the neutron drip - line exhibit neutron - halo structure or have thick neutron - skin clouds .",
    "the halo structure , a new form of the nuclear matter , is characterized by a spatially extended low density distribution around the core part of normal density .",
    "it is interesting to know how a nucleus changes its structure with the increase of the number of neutrons and how the binding of the neutrons is attained in such a system . in the very light nuclei",
    "the mean field is not stable enough to generate the regular shell structure but , instead , the clustering of the nucleons , especially the @xmath6-clustering plays an important role in determining their structure . because of this the light nuclei show individual features which have strong dependence on the number of nucleons .",
    "the be isotopes are of special interest in this respect because they show some anomalous features which are not easily understood in a simple shell model . because the @xmath9be nucleus is known to be a typical cluster state of two @xmath6-particles , it is interesting to attempt at describing heavier be isotopes in a unified framework of two @xmath6-particles and extra neutrons .",
    "our basic question is : how well does this picture give us a consistent understanding of the be isotopes ?",
    "this question naturally leads us to the application of a multicluster model .",
    "a fully microscopic multicluster model utilizes an a - nucleon wave function , incorporating the pauli principle exactly .",
    "it has various applications in the structure study for the halo nuclei @xcite and in the nuclear astrophysics @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0be is poorly known .",
    "this is probably because all the levels but the ground state are above the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "recent experiments @xcite have , however , isolated the broad level at 6.76 mev @xcite to two states , the @xmath10 , 6.38 mev state and the @xmath11 , 6.76 mev state .",
    "a few theoretical studies on @xmath0be have already been done in various models .",
    "a projected hartree - fock calculation @xcite was carried out to study the electromagnetic properties of @xmath0be .",
    "a shell - model calculations in a ( 0 + 1)@xmath12 basis @xcite gave a reasonable spectrum but predicted too small dipole transition strength for the first excited state .",
    "there are several calculations using an @xmath13 three - cluster model .",
    "earlier calculations @xcite emphasized the three - body aspect of @xmath0be to explain its low - lying spectrum .",
    "these treated the @xmath6-particle as a structureless particle and considered its compositeness by redefining the potential with the pauli correction .",
    "recently , this type of macroscopic approach has been extensively applied to the study of @xmath0be and @xmath0b nuclei @xcite , by including the @xmath14-type arrangement in the calculation .",
    "on the other hand , some microscopic cluster - model calculations starting from 9-nucleon wave functions were accomplished in the resonating group method @xcite or in the generator coordinate method @xcite .",
    "our microscopic multicluster model has the advantage that the distortion of the constituent clusters , e.g. , the @xmath6-particle , when needed , can be included in the calculation in a consistent way .",
    "an example indicating this necessity will be discussed later in case of the @xmath15 decay of @xmath0li to @xmath0be",
    ". the macroscopic model has , however , a difficulty in taking the possibility of the cluster distortion into account .    the calculation of ref . @xcite",
    "considered the three channels of @xmath9be(0@xmath16)+@xmath17 , @xmath18he ( g.s.)+@xmath6 , and @xmath9be(2@xmath16)+@xmath17 to describe the levels of @xmath0be .",
    "a molecular model was applied in the generator coordinate framework to study the structure of @xmath0be @xcite .",
    "the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite included only @xmath9be+@xmath19 channel , where the motion of the two @xmath6-particles in @xmath9be was described in a restricted space .",
    "the two generator coordinate method calculations gave a reasonable agreement with experiment .",
    "there are , however , some noticeable disagreements between the theory and experiment .",
    "both of the macroscopic and microscopic calculations done so far were limited either in taking the pauli principle into account or in treating the three - body dynamics",
    ". further improvement will be attainable by treating the three - body dynamics more completely .    as the first of the series of studies on the be isotopes we show in this paper the results of calculation for @xmath0be in a microscopic @xmath20 model .",
    "at the same time we consider its mirror nucleus @xmath0b in an @xmath21 three - cluster model .",
    "one of the main objectives in this paper is to assess the validity of our basic assumption in case of @xmath0be .",
    "this is substantially important for the study on heavier be isotopes .",
    "to this end we carry out an extensive three - cluster model calculation that has no limitations mentioned above , and investigate carefully some important properties of the low - lying states of @xmath0be , that is , the energy spectrum , the magnetic and quadrupole moments of the @xmath22 ground state , and the electron scattering form factors .",
    "of particular interest is the enhancement of the electric dipole transition from the first excited @xmath23 state to the ground state @xcite .",
    "this reduced transition probability is nearly as large as the well known one of @xmath24be .",
    "the mechanism of the enhancement in these cases may be related to each other .",
    "another interest is the @xmath15 decay from @xmath0li to the low - lying states of @xmath0be @xcite .",
    "we will show that this @xmath15 decay is useful to reveal small components contained in the wave function of @xmath0be .",
    "the levels of @xmath0b are all particle - unbound and only few of them have spin assignments @xcite .",
    "there are discussions on the missing @xmath23 state from the viewpoint of the coulomb displacement energy @xcite . as a mirror nucleus of @xmath0be ,",
    "@xmath0b can be described in an @xmath21 three - cluster model .",
    "a cluster model has a unique advantage that it can describe the asymptotic part of a wave function well and thereby predict the position and width of a resonance .",
    "this is a very important ingredient for a detailed structure study of both @xmath0be and @xmath0b because their states are mostly unbound .    in our approach",
    "the total wave function is given as an antisymmetrized product of the internal states of the clusters and the function of the relative motion .",
    "the antisymmetrization of all the nucleons is exactly taken into account .",
    "two types of cluster arrangements , @xmath14 and @xmath25 , are combined to include the different correlation between the clusters .",
    "the nucleon in the @xmath14 arrangement corresponds to moving in a `` molecular '' orbit around the @xmath9be=@xmath26 core . on the contrary",
    ", the @xmath25 arrangement is suited to describe an `` atomic '' orbit of the nucleon around the @xmath6-particle .",
    "this analogy should not , however , be taken so literally particularly when the particles come closer , because the configurations of the two arrangements have considerable overlap .",
    "the function of the relative motion is approximated by a linear combination of nodeless harmonic - oscillator functions of different size parameters .",
    "our experience @xcite shows that the approximation with such functions gives an accurate description up to large distances . to keep the dimension of the basis low",
    ", we apply the stochastic variational method ( svm ) @xcite , in which we set up the `` important '' basis states stepwise by using an admittance test .",
    "this procedure was successfully applied to study the exotic nuclei @xcite and also to few - body systems @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section ii",
    "we give a brief outline of our formalism . the microscopic three - cluster model",
    "is presented in subsection iia .",
    "the scaling methods which we apply to determine the position and width of a resonance state are briefly explained in subsection iib .",
    "section iii contains the results of calculations .",
    "the input parameters are given in subsection iiia .",
    "the relative importance of the arrangements and the angular momentum channels are discussed in subsection iiib .",
    "energies , radii , magnetic and quadrupole moments , electron scattering form factors are compared with experiment in subsection iiic .",
    "the density distributions and the spectroscopic amplitudes are discussed in subsection iiid .",
    "the @xmath15 decay of @xmath0li to the states of @xmath0be is discussed in subsection iiie . in the last section",
    "we summarize the most important conclusions .",
    "to describe the system consisting of @xmath1 for @xmath0be or of @xmath2 for @xmath0b , we build up a trial function which is a sum over two cluster arrangements @xmath27 , @xmath28 = @xmath14 and @xmath29 = @xmath30 , with @xmath19 = @xmath17 or @xmath31 .",
    "each arrangement is associated with a particular set of intercluster jacobi coordinates @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the arrangement @xmath28 are chosen to stand for the relative coordinate of the @xmath6-particles and the nucleon coordinate measured from the center - of - mass coordinate of two @xmath6 s , while , in the arrangement @xmath29 , they represent the relative distance vector between the nucleon and @xmath6 and the relative coordinate of another @xmath6 from the center - of - mass coordinate of the nucleon and @xmath6 .",
    "the arrangement @xmath28 is suited to describe the component corresponding to the @xmath9be+@xmath19 decomposition at large distances , while the arrangement @xmath29 corresponds to the @xmath18he+@xmath6 decomposition .",
    "the total orbital angular momentum @xmath34 is obtained by coupling the orbital angular momenta @xmath35 belonging to the jacobi coordinates @xmath36 , and then it is coupled with the total spin @xmath37 = @xmath38 to get the total angular momentum @xmath39 .",
    ". the intrinsic wave function of the @xmath6-particle is constructed from a harmonic - oscillator slater determinant with a fixed size parameter by eliminating the center - of - mass motion .",
    "the wave function of the intercluster motion is approximated by a linear combination of nodeless harmonic - oscillator functions ( or `` gaussians '' ) of different size parameters : @xmath40 with @xmath41^{1/2 } , \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ { \\cal y}_{\\ell m}({\\bf x})=x^{\\ell }   y_{\\ell m}({\\hat { \\bf x } } ) .\\ ] ]    the wave function with the angular momenta @xmath42jm$ ] ( @xmath37 = @xmath38 ) in the arrangement @xmath27 can be written as @xmath43jm } = \\sum_{k } c^{\\mu}_{k , s(\\ell_1\\ell_2)l } { \\cal a}\\left \\{\\left [ \\phi _ s \\left [ { \\gamma } _ { \\ell_1}(\\nu^{\\mu}_{k_1 } ,   \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\rho$}^{\\mu}_1){\\gamma}_{\\ell_2 } ( \\nu^{\\mu}_{k_2},\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\rho$}^{\\mu}_2)\\right ] _ l \\right ] _ { jm}\\right \\ } , \\label{trialfnterm}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the @xmath45th size parameter of the @xmath46th relative motion in the cluster arrangement @xmath27 , @xmath47 is the intercluster antisymmetrizer normalized such that the normalization kernel approaches the unit operator in the limit of infinite cluster separation , @xmath48 is a product of the intrinsic wave functions of the two @xmath6-particles and the nucleon s spin - isospin function and @xmath49 stands for the set of the indices @xmath50 of the size parameters . by using an integral transformation @xcite , the antisymmetrized product in eq .",
    "( 3 ) can be rewritten as a linear combination of slater determinants of gaussian wave - packet single - particle functions .",
    "the matrix elements between slater determinants of these nonorthogonal single - particle states are easily evaluated and can be expressed in a closed analytical form .",
    "the variational trial function is a combination of different arrangements and intercluster angular momenta : @xmath51jm}+\\psi^{\\mu_2}_{[s,(\\ell_1\\ell_2)l]jm}\\bigr\\}. \\label{trialfn}\\ ] ] it is noted that our wave function is fully antisymmetrized , free from the spurious center - of - mass motion ( actually the total center - of - mass motion is eliminated ) and has a good total angular momentum and parity .",
    "our calculation is the so - called `` variation after projection '' type .",
    "the partial waves in a given cluster arrangement form a complete set of states and the different jacobi coordinate systems are , therefore , equivalent in principle .",
    "one might thus think that we only need to choose a particular arrangement , @xmath28 or @xmath29 , and to decompose the wave function into a complete set of partial waves in this arrangement , and that the inclusion of both the arrangements implied in eq .",
    "( 4 ) would be redundant .",
    "our experience @xcite shows , however , that the convergence of energy in a fixed arrangement is rather slow .",
    "the reason is that the components @xmath52jm}$ ] and @xmath53jm}$ ] in the arrangements @xmath28 and @xmath29 are rather different , especially , at large distances and that any component @xmath52jm}$ ] can only be represented by an infinite sum in terms of the arrangement @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , the inclusion of high partial waves in the calculation is quite expensive .",
    "our favorite choice is , therefore , to ( 1 ) decompose the wave function into partial waves in a given arrangement , ( 2 ) truncate the higher partial waves , and ( 3 ) complete the wave function by the inclusion of low partial waves of different arrangements .",
    "the arrangements and the angular momenta combined with the size parameters in the expansion make the dimension of the basis large .",
    "these basis functions are , however , nonorthogonal to each other and not all of them are equally important . in a previous paper",
    "@xcite we tested different methods to select the parameters @xmath54 that span most adequately the state space , while the dimension of the basis is kept feasible .",
    "the most efficient procedure found is the stochastic selection @xcite : we generate size parameter sets by a random choice from a region which is physically important .",
    "the parameter sets that satisfy an admittance condition are chosen to generate basis states .",
    "the calculation was repeated several times to check the convergence .",
    "the dimension for the @xmath0be ground state is around 90 .      except for the ground state of @xmath0be ,",
    "all the states of @xmath0be and @xmath0b are above the three - body threshold .",
    "the @xmath23 , 1.68 mev state of @xmath0be lies just 111 kev above the threshold , but has a width of 217@xmath5510 kev .",
    "the @xmath56 , 2.43 mev state has a narrow width .",
    "the widths of other states of isospin @xmath38 range from several hundreds kev to about 1 mev .",
    "the states of @xmath0b have generally wider widths than the corresponding states of @xmath0be .    resonances are associated with complex eigenvalues of the time - independent schrdinger equation .",
    "it is not trivial to calculate the energy and the width of a resonance state for a complex system .",
    "several methods have been developed to obtain these complex eigenvalues using square integrable functions .",
    "the most well - known methods are the complex scaling @xcite and the stabilization @xcite methods .",
    "the complex scaling method uses the unitary transformation which dilates the internal coordinates of the system according to @xmath57 , making the resonant wave functions square integrable .",
    "the eigenvalues that are associated with metastable resonance states appear as such complex eigenvalues that are independent of the scaling angle @xmath58 , when it is larger than a critical angle , and the eigenvalues that are associated with nonresonant continuum states appear as complex eigenvalues which are dependent on the scaling angle @xcite .",
    "one can expand the eigenfunctions of the complex scaled hamiltonian in terms of square integrable basis functions as we did for bound states .",
    "the variation of the energy functional with respect to the trial function , however , yields a stationary rather than a minimum principle .",
    "therefore , the stochastic basis selection procedure can not be applied here , but instead , we will work on a basis with fixed nonlinear parameters .",
    "the stabilization method @xcite utilizes the discrete states calculated in a box of large size .",
    "the stabilization method can be combined with the stochastic variational method . in this case",
    "we select the basis parameters from a confined interval .",
    "these methods have been widely applied for two- and three - body resonances in atomic physics .",
    "recently , nuclear physicists have also began to use the complex scaling method as a useful tool to locate two- @xcite and three - body @xcite resonances of nuclear systems .",
    "due to the complexity of the problem both methods require extreme numerical accuracy . to be on the safe side , we used these methods only when they are certainly able to give reliable results .",
    "that is , we used the stabilization method for narrow resonances , and calculated only the resonance energy because the calculation of the width would require an excessively large computational burden .",
    "for these quasibound states the stabilized wave functions can directly be used to calculate the matrix element of a physical operator because they are real . to locate wider resonances we used the complex scaling method . in this case",
    "we calculated both the width and the position .",
    "we have found that the energy of the narrow @xmath56 state can well be obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian in a sufficiently large basis of eq .",
    "the resonance energy remains rather stable against the change of the basis set within a reasonable range .",
    "the wave function obtained in this way is used to calculate the electromagnetic transition rates .",
    "it is very difficult to do better than this because enclosing the wave function in a box as required by the stabilization method is not trivial for the three - body system .    to apply the complex scaling method to the present case",
    ", we define the transformation @xmath59 which acts on the function of the intercluster jacobi coordinates , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath60 the eigenvalue problem of the transformed hamiltonian @xmath61 is solved for each @xmath58 value .",
    "a resonance state corresponds to an square integrable solution of the transformed hamiltonian and may be described as in eq .",
    "when the basis function of eq .",
    "( 3 ) is employed , the operation @xmath62 on the relative motion function is equivalent to multiplying the size parameters , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , by @xmath65 .",
    "the energy @xmath66 and the width @xmath67 of a resonance are obtained as the real and imaginary parts of a complex eigenvalue , @xmath68 , of @xmath69 , which remains unchanged for arbitrary values of @xmath58 within an appropriate range .",
    "the internal state of the @xmath6-particle was approximated by 0s harmonic - oscillator slater determinant wave function of a size parameter @xmath70=@xmath71 .",
    "the value of @xmath70 was chosen to be 0.26 @xmath72 to reproduce the experimental charge radius of the @xmath6-particle .",
    "the results are insensitive to the choice of the size parameter within a reasonable limit .",
    "we used minnesota nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite , which is a sum of central and spin - orbit potentials of gaussian form .",
    "the coulomb potential was included .",
    "the strength of the spin - orbit force was taken from the set iv of reichstein and tang , which gives a good fit to @xmath73 phase shifts .",
    "the central part of the minnesota potential contains an exchange - mixture parameter @xmath74 .",
    "the potential with @xmath74=1 corresponds to a serber type mixture .",
    "decreasing the value of @xmath74 from unity implies increasing repulsion in odd partial waves , while keeping the strength of even partial waves unchanged .",
    "it was set to @xmath75 in order to reproduce the ground state energy of @xmath0be .",
    "the value of @xmath75 is very close to the value ( 0.95 ) which is needed to well describe the @xmath76 scattering in the resonating group method @xcite .",
    "thus our choice should give a realistic interaction between the @xmath6-particles .",
    "the value of @xmath75 is , however , slightly smaller than the value of 0.97 recommended for the description of @xmath73 scattering . by fixing the @xmath74 and @xmath70 parameters",
    "as described above , the model contains no free parameter .",
    "no change of the potential parameters was made between @xmath0be and @xmath0b .      in our model",
    "the total spin is uniquely given by @xmath37=@xmath38 so that the total orbital angular momentum can take either @xmath77 or @xmath78 .",
    "let us show that both values of @xmath34 are needed by taking an example of the magnetic moment of @xmath0be .",
    "quite probably ( and this will be confirmed later ) the orbital motion of the protons gives a moderate contribution to the magnetic moment of @xmath0be and only the spin part needs to be considered to get a reasonable estimate of the magnetic moment .",
    "the magnetic moment is then approximated by ( @xmath39=@xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) @xmath82j}{2j(j+1)}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is the spin @xmath84-factor of the neutron in units of nuclear magneton and @xmath85 is the amplitude of the total orbital angular momentum @xmath34 in the ground state wave function . if the ground state is purely of @xmath34=1 , then the magnetic moment becomes @xmath86 @xmath87 , which is in disagreement with the observed value of @xmath881.1778 @xmath87 .",
    "an @xmath892 component of about 20 % admixture is needed to reproduce the observed value .",
    "we will see later that the potential chosen gives just the needed admixture .",
    "it is instructive to note that the magnetic moment for pure @xmath34=1 case is equal to the schmidt value of the single @xmath90 neutron .",
    "table i lists a set of arrangements and angular momenta used in the present calculation .",
    "we did several pilot calculations to know the relative importance of the arrangements and the angular momentum channels . when all the nine sets of table i are used for the @xmath22 ground state , the energy from the @xmath20 threshold is obtained as @xmath91 mev and the root mean",
    "square ( rms ) radius of point nucleon is 2.50 fm .",
    "let us call this a full calculation .",
    "when we exclude three sets belonging to the arrangement @xmath92 with @xmath93 or 2 , both energy and radius hardly change from the result of the full calculation ; the overlap of the approximate wave function with the full wave function is 0.9995 .",
    "this result is physically acceptable because the @xmath31 wave is of prime importance for the interaction between the neutron and the @xmath6-particle .",
    "if we further exclude three sets belonging to the @xmath29 arrangement with @xmath94 , then the energy increases to @xmath95 mev and the radius increases to 2.57 fm .",
    "this suggests that the arrangement @xmath96 ( @xmath9be+@xmath17-type configuration ) alone is imperfect to describe the ground state even though the @xmath97 and @xmath98 waves are taken into account for the motion of the two @xmath6-particles .",
    "this consideration leads us to the remark that the calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite using only the @xmath9be+@xmath19 channel should be accepted with some reservations . on the other hand ,",
    "if we exclude three sets belonging to the @xmath28 arrangement , then the result is very close to the full calculation ; the energy loss is merely 34 kev and the overlap of the wave functions is 0.9991 .",
    "we can thus conclude that the @xmath18he+@xmath6-type configuration with @xmath99=1 constitutes a very good approximation to the ground state wave function .",
    "as is seen from table i , the angular momentum in the @xmath29 arrangement is restricted to @xmath94 for other states .    for resonance states , particularly for high spin resonances",
    "the inclusion of high partial waves becomes important to obtain stable resonance parameters in the complex scaling method .",
    "the complex eigenvalue of the rotated hamiltonian @xmath69 is obtained by using the basis function of eq .",
    "the size parameters of the basis function are not selected randomly but are chosen as @xmath100 @xmath101 .",
    "the values of @xmath102 and @xmath49 are varied for each resonance to get stable values for its energy and width .",
    "the adopted value of @xmath49 is about 10 in the present calculation .",
    "the basis dimension used to diagonalize the rotated hamiltonian is @xmath103 times the number of the sets listed in table i. figure 2 displays an example of the complex scaled spectra of @xmath0be for @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "one can see , besides the discretized points corresponding to the three - body continuum , those points which lie on straight lines starting from the positions of the resonances of the subsystems .",
    "the calculated spectra of @xmath0be and @xmath0b are compared with experiment in fig .",
    "the theoretical level sequence in @xmath0be has a good correspondence with the observed spectrum .",
    "the second @xmath22 resonance is obtained at 4.3 mev excitation energy .",
    "the other calculations @xcite also predict the @xmath106 state .",
    "although no such state is cited in ref .",
    "@xcite , the calculated resonance may correspond to the state at 5.59 mev mentioned in ref .",
    "we get two broad overlapping resonances with @xmath10 and @xmath11 at about 6.5 mev .",
    "this agrees with the conclusion of the recent experiments @xcite . we could not find a resonance with @xmath107 around 8 mev excitation energy in accordance with refs .",
    "@xcite , although such a state is parenthetically quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite . instead of this a @xmath56 resonance is obtained at 7.9 mev , which agrees with the result of refs . @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0b is less known experimentally compared to that of @xmath0be .",
    "the calculated spectrum is similar to the one of @xmath0be .",
    "we can predict the energy and the width of several resonances in @xmath0b with the same accuracy as the case of @xmath0be .",
    "for example , our calculation predicts a missing @xmath107 state at 2.43 mev , which is in agreement with the result of a recent @xmath0be(@xmath108 ) reaction @xcite that located the @xmath107 state at 2.83 mev .",
    "although no definitive spin assignment is made to the state at 2.788 mev excitation energy @xcite , our calculation supports a @xmath109 assignment rather than @xmath110 .",
    "table ii lists the energies and the widths of the unbound states calculated by the complex scaling method .",
    "the energies of the @xmath56 states of both @xmath0be and @xmath0b are in good agreement with experiment .",
    "their widths , though extremely narrow , are reasonably reproduced ; the calculated width of @xmath0be is about 2 times larger than the observed value , while the width of @xmath0b is about a half of the experiment .",
    "the calculation reproduces the widths of other states within a factor of 2 .",
    "our result is in better agreement with experiment than the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there has been considerable effort to determine the location of the @xmath23 state from the point of view of a thomas - ehrman shift @xcite .",
    "we applied the complex scaling method to find a resonance with @xmath111 by including the arrangements and the angular momentum channels listed in table i. the present calculation could not identify such a stable complex eigenvalue that can be interpreted as a resonance . to estimate the @xmath51 transition strength , we increase the value of @xmath74 to make the @xmath23 state particle - bound .    the electromagnetic moments and the rms radii of proton , neutron , and nucleon , assuming pointlike nucleons , are included in table iii .",
    "bare operators are used in the calculation .",
    "the charge radius of @xmath0be with the effect of the proton s finite size becomes 2.54 fm and fits the experimental value of @xmath112 fm @xcite .",
    "the rms radius of neutron is larger than that of proton by 0.2 fm .",
    "both the magnetic and the quadrupole moments of @xmath0be are reproduced very well . as was stated in subsection iiib ,",
    "the contribution of the proton s orbital motion to the magnetic moment is rather small ( 0.28 @xmath87 ) and the contribution of the spin part , @xmath113 , corresponds to 15.1 % admixture of the @xmath892 component .",
    "the @xmath114 and @xmath115 transition probabilities of the @xmath56 state to the ground state are also well reproduced .",
    "the strong @xmath116 transition of the @xmath23 state is in reasonable agreement with experiment .",
    "the @xmath116 transition strength depends on the description of the tail part of the wave function . with @xmath117 the energy of the @xmath23 state changes to 593 kev below the threshold and",
    "the @xmath118 value becomes 0.24 w.u .",
    "in good agreement with experiment . with @xmath119",

    "we note that the @xmath116 operator is recast to @xmath173 , where @xmath174 and @xmath175 are the center - of - mass coordinates of the protons and the neutrons , respectively .",
    "the enhancement of the transition should be therefore related to the excitation of the corresponding motion in the excited state . in the @xmath20 model",

    "figure 7 compares the monopole density of the @xmath23 state obtained with @xmath117 with that of the ground state .",

    "it is easy to understand that the large @xmath116 transition strength has naturally come out from the structure change of the underlying states .",

    "these characteristics are understood by the microscopic @xmath6-@xmath6 cluster - model analysis for @xmath9be .",
    "the appearance of the nodes is understood in relation to the existence of the pauli - forbidden states @xcite .",
    "the norm of the amplitude , which is called the spectroscopic factor , becomes 1.03 , 0.77 , and 0.32 corresponding to three channels shown in fig .",
    "we note that the norm is different from the so - called amount of clustering .",

    "9 , where @xmath179 is now the distance between @xmath17 and @xmath6 and @xmath180 the distance between their center - of - mass and @xmath6 .",
    "the nodes appear also in this case but their positions alter particularly at large @xmath179 .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath180 is approximately equal to the @xmath6-@xmath6 distance at small @xmath179 but deviates largely from it with increasing @xmath179 .",
    "the spectroscopic factor is 0.84 and 0.61 , respectively .",
    "because the ground state and the @xmath186 , 2.43 mev state are described well by the present model , the @xmath15 decay of the @xmath0li ground state to these states is expected to further test the accuracy of their wave functions or an available wave function of @xmath0li .",
    "the experimental value of log@xmath187 for the @xmath15 decay to the @xmath0be ground state is about 5.31 @xcite , indicating that the @xmath15-decay matrix element is fairly suppressed despite the allowed transition .",
    "the weak @xmath15 decay is ascribed to the fact that the spatial symmetry of the main component of @xmath0be is different from that of @xmath0li @xcite .",
    "the gamow - teller ( gt ) matrix element , @xmath188 to any state of @xmath0be , if it is described by the @xmath20 three - cluster model , always vanishes regardless of the wave function of @xmath0li .",
    "this is most easily understood by acting the hermitian conjugate of the gt operator on the @xmath0be wave function and by noting that the spin - isospin part of the @xmath6-particle wave function is fully occupied .",
    "the above discussion indicates that the simple three - cluster model for @xmath0be must be modified to explain the @xmath15 decay in spite of the successful results obtained in the previous subsections .",
    "the modification must be small enough not to destroy the agreement between experiment and the three - cluster model calculation .",
    "one possible way for the modification is to introduce the distortion of the @xmath6-particle into @xmath7 and @xmath8 configurations . to explore the consequence of this modification ,",
    "let us assume that the intrinsic wave function of the @xmath6-particle can be expressed by @xmath189 where @xmath190 represents the part which can be described by the 0s harmonic - oscillator slater determinant , while @xmath191 the distorted part which is orthogonal to @xmath190 .",
    "the @xmath0be wave function in a more realistic three - cluster model can therefore be approximated by @xmath192 here the normalization constant , @xmath193 , is close to unity when @xmath194 is small and it is suppressed below . the first term , @xmath195 , is nothing but the one described by the @xmath20 model and has no contribution to the @xmath15 decay . by neglecting the last term ,",
    "the gt matrix element is given by @xmath196 with @xmath197 equations ( 24 ) and ( 25 ) are our basic equations to calculate the @xmath15 decay matrix element when the distortion of the @xmath6-particle is included .",
    "the wave function of eq .",
    "( 25 ) is obtained by extending the three - cluster model to the four - cluster model which includes @xmath198 and @xmath199 partitions . in order to avoid excessive numerical calculations ,",
    "the angular momentum channels and the cluster arrangements are rather limited .",
    "1(b ) and table iv .",
    "the spins of all the clusters were coupled to @xmath200 .",
    "the isospins were not coupled to a definite value so that the wave function of the extended model may in general contain the total isospin of @xmath201 and @xmath79 .",
    "the potential favors @xmath201 for the low - lying states of @xmath0be .",
    "the intrinsic wave function of the @xmath202- and @xmath203-cluster was described by 0s harmonic - oscillator slater determinant of the same size parameter @xmath70 as that of the @xmath6-particle .",
    "the ground state wave function obtained in the four - cluster model using the minnesota potential of @xmath74=0.94 has the overlap integral of 0.971 with the one obtained in the three - cluster model .",
    "therefore , this new wave function should yield substantially the same results as the previous one for the electromagnetic properties .",
    "this is just what we have expected to maintain in extending the model space .    to calculate the @xmath15-decay probability we use the @xmath0li ground - state wave function which was obtained in a microscopic @xmath204 four - cluster model @xcite",
    "this model for @xmath0li reproduced both magnetic and quadrupole moments of the ground state very well . to fit the energy of the @xmath0be ground state to its experimental value from the four - body threshold",
    ", we changed the @xmath74 parameter to 0.88 in the four - cluster model calculation .",
    "the overlap integral of the wave functions between the three - cluster and four - cluster models becomes 0.973 and the resulting log@xmath187 value is 5.60 .",
    "the log@xmath187 value is still a little too large compared to the experimental value of 5.31 , but this calculation strongly indicates that we are on the right track . a further refined four - cluster model calculation for both @xmath0be and @xmath0li will reduce the disagreement between experiment and theory because such a calculation is expected to enhance the gt matrix element .",
    "the shell - model calculation @xcite gives the log@xmath187 value in the range of 4.86 to 5.64 , depending on the interaction used .",
    "it is interesting to analyze in the way presented above the @xmath15 decay of @xmath0c to the low - lying states of @xmath0b and an asymmetry in the @xmath15-decay matrix elements of @xmath205 nuclei @xcite .",

    "the three - body dynamics of the clusters was taken into account by including both of the arrangements , @xmath206 and @xmath207 , and by using relevant partial waves between the relative motion of the clusters .",
    "the calculated spectrum of @xmath0be below an excitation energy of 8 mev was in fair agreement with experiment .",
    "we obtained two broad overlapping resonances with @xmath208 and @xmath11 around 6.5 mev , in agreement with the conclusion of the recent experiments .",
    "two states , @xmath209 and @xmath210 , were predicted at about 4.5 mev and 8mev in excitation energy , respectively .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0b was found to be similar to that of @xmath0be .",
    "the spin and parity of several states of @xmath0b were predicted .",
    "the first excited @xmath23 state was not localized in the present study and thus no definite argument was possible on a thomas - ehrman shift in this case .",
