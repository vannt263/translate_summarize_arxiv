    "@xcite on the contrary , much less is known about systems with orbital degeneracies .",
    "the simplest system with such degeneracies is the two - level spinless quantum dot , which was studied theoretically in connection with phenomena such as phase lapses of the transmission phase,@xcite charge oscillations , @xcite and correlation induced conduction resonances.@xcite relations between these phenomena were discussed in refs .  .",
    "while refs .  , investigated the properties of the system in the low - bias limit , the present paper deals with the effects of finite bias and temperature . for typical parameters applicable to experiments , we find that changing the bias might lead to qualitatively very different results .",

    "it should be pointed out that this population inversion results from a finite bias and is different from what is studied in refs .  .",
    "in this section we discuss the hamiltonian of the spinless two - level quantum dot as well as the modeling of the current through the system . in the single - particle eigenbasis of the dot ,",
    "the system hamiltonian is given by :    @xmath12    where we have assumed that the couplings @xmath13 are independent of @xmath14 and @xmath15 with a constant density of states @xmath16 , for @xmath17 . in the simulations",

    "bias is applied symmetrically to the quantum dot so that the chemical potentials are @xmath26 and @xmath27 , for the left and right contact , respectively .    in this paper",
    "we mainly study couplings of the type    @xmath28    where the asymmetry parameter @xmath29 is chosen to be real .",
    "time - reversal symmetry assures that the coupling elements are real , implying that the two dot states couple to the leads with the same or opposite parity.@xcite this paper focuses on the case of opposite parity as it is essential for the canyon of current suppression at finite bias , see sec .",

    "starting from the von neumann equation an equation of motion is derived not only for the reduced density matrix but also for the elements of the total density matrix consisting of a single electron - hole excitation in the contact . in the latter system of equations two electron - hole excitation elements , corresponding to co - tunneling , enter . in the time evolution of the co - tunneling processes",
    "there are contributions from three electron - hole excitation elements but these are ignored .",
    "this results in a closed set of equations , which can be solved for the occupations of the dot levels , the coherences between these resulting from the coupling to the leads , and the current flowing through the quantum dot .",
    "there are currently several other methods that account for tunneling of higher order than sequential processes .",
    "the most widely used technique is the generalized master equation approach which can be derived in many different ways including the real - time diagrammatic technique@xcite and the bloch - redfield approach originally developed in refs .  .",
    "comparisons of different approaches have been performed in refs .  .",
    "the detailed relation between these methods and the 2vn - method will be the subject of future investigations , where we show that the 2vn - method is similar to other methods of @xmath31 order in the couplings @xmath32 , but contains certain diagrams up to infinite order .",
    "for the anderson model with infinite @xmath6 it has been shown to give the same current as the resonant - tunneling approximation@xcite in the real - time diagrammatic approach.@xcite this method includes irreducible diagrams with an arbitrary number of correlated tunneling processes , but restricted to one electron - hole excitation at any given moment .",
    "we proceed by investigating whether the canyon of current suppression observed in ref .   can be found only in a certain parameter space or if it is generic for the studied two - level system .",

    "the complete suppression found close to degeneracy in the case of @xmath36 is also supported by the analytical arguments of sec .",

    "[ canyon](c ) shows that the 2vn - method can sometimes give unphysical results corresponding to small negative currents .",

    "the contributions of these terms become important in the limit of large couplings and small temperature and bias .",
    "apart from this , the 2vn method agrees well with the noninteracting results",
    ". however , we see that the shift of the suppression line is larger when the couplings are strong . as explained in sec .",
    "vi this can be attributed to the broadening of the levels . in the coulomb blockade regime a clear conductance suppression is found .",
    "this is the regime where @xmath2 dominates , i.e. , the situation described by refs .  .",

    "this interaction - induced suppression is not included in the negf - method , resulting in only partial suppression , as can be seen from the gray colored canyon .",
    "the current suppression in the co - tunneling region becomes weaker as we are approaching the region where @xmath3 dominates , which results in only partial current suppression , see sec .",
    "v. this shows that the canyon of current suppression is found in all four cases albeit the current not always entirely drops to zero .",
    "further investigations show that the canyon of suppression is not restricted to couplings like eq .",

    "one also sees that no canyon is visible in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "the reason is that the width of the dip in the transmission function becomes increasingly narrow as the singular coupling point is approached . at such couplings ,",
    "one can at degeneracy completely decouple one level from the leads , resulting in a bistable system , see also refs .  .",
    "as a result , the canyon is present only for very low bias and temperature , i.e. a regime where the 2vn - method is not applicable .",

    ". there is , however , partial canceling due to the different parity of the two levels .",
    "we stress that the complete suppression at electron - hole symmetry is not an effect of this difference in parity .",
    "the pseudo - spin operators are always orthogonal .",
    "it is this orthogonality that gives equal occupations of the two levels and ensures the canceling of current carrying processes in the low - bias limit .",
    "the canceling is due to the phase lapse between the elastic co - tunneling processes using @xmath105 and @xmath108 as the virtual intermediate state .",
    "this shows the relationship between population switches , phase lapses , and vanishing conductance , which was previously investigated in ref .  .",
    "at electron - hole symmetry the vanishing conductance is thus an effect of the correlations induced by the coulomb interaction .",
