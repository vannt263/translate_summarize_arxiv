    "to our knowledge , there is no previous qsgw study for the cuprate band structure although it has been discussed conceptually @xcite .",
    "here we first examine the electronic structure and the two - band theory for the material - dependent t@xmath1 of a single layer cuprate .",
    "while the qsgw calculation produces notable differences in the band structure and fermi surface from lda , the two - band explanation for t@xmath1 still remains valid .",
    "qsgw results of model parameters are presented and compared to the rixs data as well as the lda calculations .",
    "it clearly shows that the parameters produced by qsgw are in better agreement with the experiment .",
    "finally , we investigate the epitaxially strained la@xmath5cuo@xmath6 whose noticeable t@xmath1 increase has been previously reported .",
    "two - band theory also works well for this situation .",
    "[ figure 1](a ) and ( b ) show the band dispersion and projected density of states ( pdos ) of la@xmath5cuo@xmath6 calculated by lda and qsgw , respectively .",
    "the lda result is in good agreement with the previous calculation ( see , for example , ref .   and ref .  ) . in the qsgw ,",
    "several important differences are noted .",
    "first , the band width of both @xmath13 orbitals are significantly reduced , by about 1.30 and 0.65 ev for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , indicating that the band width overestimation ( or effective mass underestimation ) problem of lda is somehow overcome by the qsgw procedure .",
    "another key difference is that the separation between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands becomes larger in qsgw , as seen in fig .",
    "[ figure 1](b ) .",
    "the @xmath2 energy level , e@xmath14 , is shifted from @xmath150.14 ( lda ) to @xmath150.03 ( qsgw ) while e@xmath16 is from @xmath150.98 ( lda ) to @xmath151.68 ( qsgw ) ( indicated by the arrows in fig .",
    "[ figure 1 ] ; see also table  [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "it is a factor of two difference in @xmath7e@xmath17 ; 0.84 ev in lda and 1.66 in qsgw .",
    "the correct estimation of this quantity is important especially in the two - band theory for t@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the large value of @xmath18 is indeed consistent with the rixs data as will be discussed further below .",
    "the same features are also found in hgba@xmath5cuo@xmath6 , as presented in fig .",
    "[ figure 1](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the @xmath2 band width is reduced by @xmath40.75 ev in qsgw compared to lda and its center position of pdos moves slightly upward by 0.15 ev . while the @xmath3 dispersion in this material is already quite small due to the thicker blocking layer",
    ", its band width in qsgw is further reduced .",
    "@xmath7e@xmath17 is 2.25 in qsgw , again noticeably larger than the lda value of 1.67 ev ( see table  [ tab:1 ] ) .    in qsgw ,",
    "the @xmath7e@xmath17 of both la@xmath5cuo@xmath6 and hgba@xmath5cuo@xmath6 is enhanced compared to lda / gga .",
    "how does this affect the theoretical estimation of t@xmath1 ?",
    "first , it should be noted that these parameters can not be directly adopted as the inputs for the flex calculation .",
    "this is because , in principle , the qsgw self energy should be partially subtracted before we put it into any of many - body calculations . while there is no well - defined prescription yet for this kind of ` double - counting ' problem @xcite , the `` best '' @xmath7e@xmath17 that should be adopted in the flex evaluation of t@xmath1 may be lying somewhere in between the qsgw and lda / gga values .",
    "this can provide better quantitative agreement with the experiment , especially in la@xmath5cuo@xmath6 , for which the lda / gga value of @xmath7e@xmath17 is found to be too small to account for @xmath19k .",
    "oxygen states are also affected .",
    "compared to lda results , the o-@xmath20 levels obtained by qsgw are significantly lowered in energy , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ figure 2 ] .",
    "as summarized in table  [ tab:1 ] , the center position of in - plane oxygen pdos is located at @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) ev in lda and at @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) ev in qsgw for la@xmath5cuo@xmath6 ( hgba@xmath5cuo@xmath6 ) .",
    "the same feature is found for the apical o-@xmath25 pdos . as a result , the energy difference , @xmath7e@xmath26=e@xmath27e@xmath28 ,",
    "is changed from 1.68 ( 1.00 ) in lda to 0.55 ( @xmath150.86 ) in qsgw for the case of la@xmath5cuo@xmath6 ( hgba@xmath5cuo@xmath6 ) , see table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "the correct estimation of @xmath7e@xmath26 is also important for understanding t@xmath1 since it is an underlying quantity to determine @xmath7e@xmath17 ( @xmath29 @xmath7e @xmath29 @xmath7e@xmath30 + @xmath7e@xmath31",
    "@xcite ) in combination with other parameters .",
    "some other changes produced by qsgw are also noted .",
    "the @xmath3 components in the bands below @xmath151.5 ev in fig .",
    "[ figure 1](a ) are reduced in qsgw , and the free - electron - like bands at @xmath32 and @xmath33 points above the fermi energy are shifted upward . as the position of the @xmath34 complex is lowered ( red color ) , the @xmath2 band has almost no mixture with other bands below the fermi energy .",
    "higher - lying la-@xmath35 bands ( not shown ) move further upward as has been previously noted in the nickelate systems @xcite .",
    "the shape of the fermi surface is important for understanding cuprate superconductivity .",
    "for example , its nesting is crucial for the spin fluctuation pairing .",
    "also , a notable correlation between the experimentally observed t@xmath1 at the optimal doping ( t@xmath36 ) and the fermi surface warping has been identified by pavarini _",
    "_ @xcite . here",
    "we discuss the fermi surface calculated by qsgw in comparison to the lda result and experiment .",
    "the calculated fermi surfaces are presented in fig .",
    "[ figure 3 ] ; lda ( ( a , c ) ) and qsgw ( ( b , d ) ) .",
    "the hole doping is simulated by the rigid band shift method so that the electron occupation in @xmath13 orbitals is reduced by 0.15@xmath37 per unit cell .",
    "notable features are found in the qsgw fermi surface for la@xmath5cuo@xmath6 .",
    "contrary to the lda result of fig .",
    "[ figure 3](a ) , fig .",

    "this feature is in good agreement with arpes data  @xcite which also reports the pocket centered at ( @xmath38 , @xmath38 ) point .",
    "further , the @xmath3-orbital character ( dark purple ) is significantly reduced and the @xmath2 character ( bright yellow ) is dominant in the qsgw result , which is distinctive from the lda in which the significant amount of @xmath3 components are observed near ( @xmath38 , 0 ) and ( 0 , @xmath38 ) .    in the case of hgba@xmath5cuo@xmath6 ,",
    "the difference between lda and qsgw is less pronounced , see fig .",
    "[ figure 3](c ) and ( d ) . while the qsgw fermi surface is slightly more rounded , the overall shape is not much different . since the @xmath2 orbital character is dominant and @xmath3 band",
    "is well separated from fermi level already in lda due to the thicker blocking layers enhancing two - dimensional feature , the lda result is quite similar to qsgw .",
    "we now turn to the comparison with the rixs data .",
    "recently , sala _ et al . _",
    "@xcite successfully extracted the important model parameters for several different cuprate materials based on rixs spectra .",
    "in this subsection , we examine the material dependent parameters by qsgw and compare them to the experimental values . with ref .   as our main reference ,",
    "we include two more compounds , namely , sr@xmath5cuo@xmath5cl@xmath5 and cacuo@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "our results are summarized in table  [ tab:1 ] , fig .",
    "[ figure 4 ] , and fig .",
    "[ figure 5 ] .",
    "the values of 10@xmath39 , defined as the difference between two energy levels of @xmath2 and @xmath40 ( see fig .  [",
    "figure 4](a ) ) , are larger in the qsgw calculation by @xmath462125% than the lda values .",
    "while lda underestimates @xmath41 compared to the experiment , qsgw slightly overestimates , which is related to the tendency that cu-@xmath34 bands are pushed down relative to @xmath13 , as was also observed in the previous qsgw calculations for other transition - metal oxides @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that overall the qsgw result is in better agreement with experiment , as clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ figure 4](b ) .    as noted in the above ,",
    "according to the two - band theory by sakakibara _",
    "@xcite , the important parameter that governs t@xmath1 is @xmath7e@xmath17 ( or @xmath42+@xmath43 in ref .  ) .",
    "[ figure 4](b ) and fig .",
    "[ figure 5 ] clearly show that the calculated values of @xmath7e@xmath17 by qsgw are in excellent agreement with those from rixs spectra ; the difference is 28 % .",
    "the lda values are noticeably smaller than the experiments although the difference gets reduced in the higher t@xmath1 materials , cacuo@xmath5 and hgba@xmath5cuo@xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "[ figure 5 ] ) .",
    "this can be taken as a strong support for the two - band theory in the sense that the lda value of @xmath7e@xmath17 as an input for flex provides qualitative information of material dependence , while the @xmath7e@xmath17 by qsgw already contains the correlation effect beyond lda , being consistent with rixs .",
    "another parameter deduced from rixs in ref .   is @xmath44@xmath43 , the energy level difference between @xmath40 and @xmath45 . in this case , the lda results are not much different from qsgw and experiment ( see fig .",
    "[ figure 4](b ) ) .",
    "an interesting aspect found in the t@xmath1 trend of the cuprates is its significant enhancement in the thin film form .",
    "_ reported @xcite that t@xmath1 can be controlled by epitaxial strain by about factor of two @xcite .",
    "the underdoped la@xmath5cuo@xmath6 with its bulk t@xmath1 of 25k exhibits a higher and lower t@xmath1 of @xmath449 k and 10 k when it is grown on srlaalo@xmath6 ( slao ) and srtio@xmath46 ( sto ) substrates , respectively @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to check whether the two - band theory is also consistent with this observation .    in order to simulate the tensile and compressive strain produced by sto and slao , we first optimized the @xmath47 lattice parameter with two different in - plane lattice constants , @xmath48=3.905 and @xmath49=3.755   , for la@xmath5cuo@xmath6 , which originally has @xmath50=3.782     and @xmath51=13.25   .",
    "as expected , the optimized out - of - plane parameters get smaller and larger under the tensile and compressive strain , respectively ; @xmath52=12.96 and @xmath53 = 13.36 . as a result ,",
    "the ratio between the out - of - plane and in - plane cu  o distance , @xmath54 , is found to be 1.32 , 1.28 , and 1.24 , for @xmath55 , @xmath50 and @xmath48 , respectively .    the calculated values of @xmath7e@xmath17 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure 6 ] .",
    "both lda and qsgw predict that @xmath7e@xmath17 gets enhanced and reduced under compressive and tensile strain , respectively , which is consistent with the experimental observation @xcite .",
    "the reduction of @xmath7e@xmath17 at a=@xmath56 is about 0.16 ev in both lda and qsgw , and the enhancement at a=@xmath57 is 0.29 ( lda ) and 0.47 ev ( qsgw ) .",
    "using the qsgw method , we re - examined the electronic structure of copper oxide high temperature superconducting materials .",
    "several important features were found to have been captured by the @xmath0 procedure , such as effective mass enhancement . the shape and orbital character of the fermi surface were",
    "also notably changed , especially for the case of la@xmath5cuo@xmath6 , and they are in good agreement with the arpes data @xcite .",
    "important model parameters including the key quantity for the two - band theory of t@xmath1 , @xmath7e@xmath17 , were examined , and the qsgw results were in excellent agreement with rixs data .",
    "the present study shows that the first - principles band calculation can quantitatively reproduce the experimental observation by taking into account the correlation effects beyond lda .",
    "we emphasize that it is not inconsistent with the previous study by sakakibara _",
    "et al . _ which takes the lda result as an input for the many - body calculation of superconductivity",
    "while the qsgw result can not be used as a direct input for the flex - type calculation because of the partial double - counting of the many - body correlation , the `` best '' non - interacting hamiltonian , that can serve as an input , may lie somewhere in between the lda and qsgw . obtaining a well - defined non - interacting hamiltonian is , therefore , an important future direction for the first - principles - based description of high - temperature superconductivity , and it may quantitatively resolve the problem of low t@xmath1 in la@xmath5cuo@xmath6 produced by the lda input @xcite .",
    "the qsgw @xcite calculates @xmath58 ( non - interacting hamiltonian describing quasiparticles or band structures ) and @xmath59 ( dynamically - screened coulomb interactions between the quasiparticles within the random phase approximation ) in a self - consistent manner .",
    "while the ` one - shot ' @xmath0 is a perturbative calculation starting from a given @xmath58 ( usually from lda / gga ) , qsgw is a self - consistent perturbation method that can determine the one - body hamiltonian within itself .",

    ", one can define a new static one - body hamiltonian @xmath58 , and continue to apply @xmath0 approximation until converged . in principle , the final result of qsgw does not depend on the initial conditions .",
    "previous qsgw studies , ranging from semiconductors @xcite to the various @xmath66 transition metal oxides @xcite and @xmath35-electron systems @xcite , have demonstrated its capability in the description of weakly and strongly correlated electron materials .",
    "we used our new implementation of qsgw @xcite by adopting the ` augmented plane wave ( apw ) + muffin - tin orbital ( mto ) ' , designated by ` pmt ' @xcite , for the one - body solver .",

    ". a key feature of this scheme for qsgw is that the expansion of @xmath61 can be made with mtos , not apws , which enables us to make the real space representation of @xmath61 at any @xmath67 point .",

    "<S> despite decades of progress , an understanding of unconventional superconductivity still remains elusive . </S>",
    "<S> an important open question is about the material dependence of the superconducting properties . using the quasiparticle self - consistent @xmath0 method , we re - examine the electronic structure of copper oxide high - t@xmath1 materials . </S>",
    "<S> we show that qsgw captures several important features , distinctive from the conventional lda results . </S>",
    "<S> the energy level splitting between @xmath2 and @xmath3 is significantly enlarged and the van hove singularity point is lowered . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated results compare better than lda with recent experimental results from resonant inelastic xray scattering and angle resolved photoemission experiments . </S>",
    "<S> this agreement with the experiments supports the previously suggested two - band theory for the material dependence of the superconducting transition temperature , t@xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> after the seminal work of finding high temperature superconductivity in a ceramic copper oxide material @xcite , efforts to understand the cuprate have long been a central part of modern condensed matter physics . although many intriguing aspects of its electronic behaviors have been unveiled and great progress has been made , an understanding of its superconducting mechanism , the novel interplay between competing phases , and its relationship to other correlated phenomena is still far from clear @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one simple , well - defined but still open question is what determines the superconducting transition temperature ( t@xmath1 ) , or its material dependency . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the t@xmath1 of the single layer cuprates can be different by a factor of two ; @xmath440k for la@xmath5cuo@xmath6 and @xmath490k for hgba@xmath5cuo@xmath6 . on the one hand </S>",
    "<S> , it may be too early to ask this question , while the superconducting mechanism itself still remains elusive . </S>",
    "<S> on the other , however , figuring out the detailed features behind the material dependency can provide the crucial hint for further understanding of superconductivity and other related properties . in fact , many directly or indirectly related theoretical studies have been performed on this issue @xcite .    in this regard , </S>",
    "<S> a notable suggestion has recently been made @xcite . according to this theory , </S>",
    "<S> the t@xmath1 of the single - layer cuprate can be described with a two - orbital model that considers both the @xmath2 and @xmath3 wannier orbitals , and the energy level offset between the two orbitals , @xmath7e , plays a key role in determining t@xmath1 . whereas the larger value of this energy separation produces the higher t@xmath1 ( _ e.g. , _ the case of hgba@xmath5cuo@xmath6 ) due to the better one band feature achieved , the smaller value results in the lower t@xmath1 ( _ e.g. , _ the case of la@xmath5cuo@xmath6 ) in spite of the better nested fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated eliashberg parameter ( @xmath8 ) based on the many - body calculation using the fluctuating exchange ( flex ) approximation @xcite clearly exhibits a linear dependence on @xmath7e while the other parameters are shown to be less important . </S>",
    "<S> further , this theory can be extended to the bilayer case @xcite , which explains the correlation between the fermi surface shape and t@xmath1 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a possible experimental test to verify this two - band theory is to examine the correlation between t@xmath1 and @xmath9 , the fermi surface shape , or the partial density of states of the @xmath3 orbital , which can be measured by recent techniques such as resonant inelastic xray scattering ( rixs ) , and ( angle resolved ) photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , while the theoretical @xmath9 or the fermi surface shape was obtained from the lda and used as the `` inputs '' for the many - body flex calculation in refs .  , the experimentally determined @xmath9 and the fermi surface shape should be regarded as the `` outputs '' or `` results '' after the consideration of the many - body correlation effects beyond lda / gga . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , while a rixs study reports that t@xmath1 is higher for larger @xmath9 @xcite , the actual experimental value of @xmath9 is larger than the theoretical evaluation , presumably due to this `` input vs. output '' problem . </S>",
    "<S> one possible way to resolve this problem , at least partially , is to re - evaluate @xmath9 as an output of the flex calculation . </S>",
    "<S> however , this approach would suffer from various ambiguities regarding the hubbard interaction strength and the definition of the renormalized @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> it is problematic since a quantitative comparison is required in between the theory and experiment , while only the qualitative comparison was made regarding @xmath10 in refs . .    </S>",
    "<S> in the present paper , we use a first - principles approach , exploiting the quasiparticle self - consistent @xmath0 ( qsgw ) method . </S>",
    "<S> it enables us to take into account the correlation effects beyond lda / gga . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we can obtain a well - defined renormalized @xmath9 without introducing adjustable parameters .    in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , a quantum chemical approach was adopted to evaluate the energy level offset between cu-@xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals , where the correlation effects were taken into account within a cluster - based configuration - interaction - type calculation . a good agreement with the rixs experiment </S>",
    "<S> was found by assuming the energy difference of ferromagnetically and antiferromagnetically ordered states to be @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the antiferromagnetic coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is fairly different and is along the line of the first - principles band calculation as in refs .  . </S>",
    "<S> in the sense mentioned above , the calculated @xmath9 can be compared to the experiments , while it should not be regarded as an input parameter for the many - body calculation , because doing so would result in a partial double counting of the correlation effects . </S>",
    "<S> still , the present approach can also provide a first - step hint toward obtaining a better `` non - interacting '' hamiltonian that can be used as an input for the many - body calculation of superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it is known that the non - interacting hamiltonian obtained from lda has a problem when used as an input for the flex calculation , and the lda / gga estimation of @xmath9 for la@xmath5cuo@xmath6 is too small to account for the maximum @xmath10 of 40k in the la@xmath5cuo@xmath6 @xcite . in this context , it is worth pointing out that the @xmath0 method has been successfully applied to the many of strongly correlated materials in combination with , for example , dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite . </S>"
