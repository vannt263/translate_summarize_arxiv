    "a nanodroplet has so large a surface - to - volume ratio that its behavior is quite different from the ordinary macroscopic droplets which we see in every - day phenomena .",
    "recently , there are growing interests in nanodroplets collisions@xcite-@xcite , since they are closely related with applications such as nanofluidics , drug delivery , ink - jet printing , _",
    "etc_. in particular , deming and mason@xcite made nanodroplets for fighting cancer . their eventual goal is to make possible that the nanodroplets can harmlessly enter into cells and then release medicinal cargo . but",
    "making better drug - delivery vehicles still needs a fundamental understanding of nanodroplets behavior .",
    "contact or collision problems in general are very complicated to model theoretically or even numerically . here",
    ", we focus on the head - on collisions of two equal - sized spherical polymer nanodroplets using molecular dynamics . molecular dynamics ( md ) has become an indispensable tool to study the phenomena in nano scale@xcite . to understand the initial compressed phase of the collision , deformations , longitudinal forces and contact radii , _ etc _",
    "are measured from the simulations .",
    "the simulation results are analyzed with the hertzian model@xcite-@xcite of colliding elastic solid balls .",
    "originally , the hertz model deals with compressed elastic balls such as steel balls .",
    "it assumes hooke s law between stress and strain .",
    "as far as i know , there is not yet any attempt to connect nanodroplet collision with the hertzian theory of elasticity .",
    "thus this is a first report to explain the initial phase of droplet collision .",
    "we will first present the hertzian theory of elasticity for equal - sized spherical elastic balls .",
    "next , we describe md simulation method and results .",
    "then , these simulation results are compared with the theoretical predictions .",
    "finally , we will summarize our findings .",
    "when two elastic balls are colliding with each other , conservation laws for energy , linear momentum and angular momentum are generally applied before and after the collision . in this case",
    ", the collision process is treated like a black box : we ignore the collision process itself .",
    "however , we want to know what is going on during the collision process .",
    "this collision process seems to be similar to that of the statical compression of two balls , which can be explained by the hertz model . here",
    ", we will summarize the hertzian model@xcite-@xcite of contacting elastic balls which have an equal - sized spherical shape with a radius @xmath0 .",
    "the contact is made by pushing them together .",
    "[ balls]a ) shows the very moment of contact .",
    "let us denote the coordinate system @xmath1 and @xmath2 as being positive in either direction from their contact point .",
    "[ balls]b ) shows their squeezed state by a force @xmath3 where @xmath3 is a normal component of an applied force from the other ball .",
    "the deformed surfaces are thus described by equations of the form @xmath4 for the right ball and @xmath5 for the left ball , respectively , as in fig .",
    "[ balls ] .",
    "let @xmath6 and @xmath7 be the x - components of the displacement vectors of the contact point on the deformed surfaces of the two balls , respectively .",
    "they are symmetrically deformed about an axis connecting the centers of balls .",
    "then , from fig",
    ". [ balls]b ) , we have the equality , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a total deformation of the colliding balls .",
    "thus , the total deformation @xmath9 varies with the force @xmath3 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]      _ vs. _ longitudinal force @xmath3 in the initial compressed phase of a collision .",
    "solid line is a fit to the data by eq .",
    "( [ deformation ] ) with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "note the poor agreement near the origin . ]",
    "_ vs. _ longitudinal force @xmath3 in the initial compressed phase of a collision .",
    "solid line is a fit to the data by eq .",
    "( [ c_radius ] ) with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "note again the poor agreement near the origin . ]    finally , to further confirm the validity of the theoretical prediction for the elastic theory of the initial compressed phase of a droplet , the contact radius @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ c_radius ] ) is calculated .",
    "the consequent results of the contact radius @xmath14 _ vs. _ force @xmath3 are depicted in fig . [ f5 ] .",
    "the values are also measured with the standard image analysis . in the same time range , the deformation @xmath9 _ vs. _ force @xmath3 in eq .",
    "[ f4 ] show the similar behavior as the prediction of eq .",
    "( [ c_radius ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , when the radius @xmath14 is smaller than 6.0 , the force @xmath3 is shapely increasing . or , at around @xmath15 , a sharp increase of stretched s - shape is observed .",
    "but at around @xmath16 , they show a linear increase . from the fitting to the data using eq .",
    "( [ c_radius ] ) , we can again obtain a value of @xmath17    from the eqs .",
    "( [ xifit ] ) and ( [ afit ] ) , we can get the estimated value of @xmath18 , which is rather larger than our initially setting value of @xmath19 , but the order of magnitude is comparable .",
    "let us now conclude our results . here , we mainly focused on the initial compressed phase for the head - on collision of equal - sized spherical polymer nanodroplets . in this phase ,",
    "the phenomenon can be explained by an elastic compressed phase in longitudinal direction . when the colliding region is too compressed to keep the spherical shape of the droplet , its shape changes into an prolate ellipsoid , as shown in fig .",
    "3c ) . the next phase is thus expansion in the transverse direction .",
    "after the compression , energy exceeds the elastic limit to support the spherical shape , it may then break into parts .",
    "the elastic behaviors of the initial compressed phase of the collision can be understood with the hertzian theory of elastic balls .",
    "the simulation results conform to this theoretical predictions .",
    "at least , the initial compressed phase of a collision , the hertzian theory of elastic balls explains rather well the simulation results as measured with deformations @xmath9 , longitudinal forces @xmath3 , and contact radii @xmath14 , except the very moment of collision . in this limit , the continuum theory of the hertz model is broken , since there are very small number of molecules involved in the collision and furthermore , the shape of the initial contact tip is far from spherical , but irregular and rough .",
    "more md simulations should be followed at different thermodynamic states and simulation control parameters for further confirmations .",
    "we considered only the initial compressed phase in this paper .",
    "to explain properly the later phases of the collision process , we need also a more elaborate theory of viscoplasticity or viscoelasticity .",
