    "the study of the density profile of cold dark matter halos beyond the virial radius is a subject of considerable relevance . from an observational point of view ,",
    "knowledge of the shape of the density profile far beyond the virial radius is essential for an appropriate interpretation of gravitational lensing phenomena ( e.g. smith et al .",
    "2001 ; guzik & seljak 2002 ; hoekstra et al .  2004 ; sheldon et al .  2004 ) , the pattern of lyman alpha absorption around virialized systems ( e.g. barkana 2004 ; bajtlik , duncan & ostriker 1988 ) as well as the motion of satellite galaxies as a test for dark matter distribution at large radii ( zaritsky & white 1994 , zaritsky et al .  1997 ; prada et al .  2003 ,",
    "brainerd 2004 ; conroy et al .",
    "2004 ) . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the study of the properties of dark matter halos at several virial radius in cosmological simulations provides an excellent benchmark for developing and testing the basic theoretical framework which will be decisive for a full understanding of the physical origin and formation of the @xmath9cdm halos .",
    "understanding halo properties involves a set of theoretical considerations .",
    "first , we have the issue of choosing the correct initial density profile . also , there is the question of which processes are relevant to the gravitational evolution of the initial profile : is only the spherical collapse what matters or is triaxiality important ?",
    "up to which radius can we use the standard spherical collapse model without shell crossing ?",
    "are highly asymmetrical processes , like merging , relevant ? in order to answer these questions",
    "it is very convenient to focus first on those properties of the halos which involve the fewest theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the dark matter density profiles at several virial radius are particularly suitable to check whether the spherical collapse model can provide accurate predictions ( see prada et al .  2005 ) .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that the spherical collapse model reproduces very well the relationship between the small values of the spherically - averaged enclosed density at those large distances and the radial velocity @xcite .",
    "we define the spherically - averaged enclosed density as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the enclosed density contrast and @xmath12 the average matter density in the universe .",
    "we can also define the spherically - averaged local density as : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the density contrast in a narrow shell of radius r. we can then obtain the density contrast @xmath14 from the enclosed density contrast @xmath11 using the relation : @xmath15    despite to all the effort done to understand the central dense regions of the dark matter halos in cosmological simulations , not much attention has been devoted to the study of the regions beyond the formal virial radius , i.e. the radius within which the spherically - averaged enclosed density is equal to some specific value .",
    "the main goal of the work presented in this paper is focused on the outskirts of the dark matter halos , where the correct evolution of the spherically - averaged enclosed density profiles can essentially be obtained using the standard ( without shell crossing ) spherical collapse model .",
    "this model , first developed by gunn & gott ( 1972 ) and gunn ( 1977 ) , describes the collision - less collapse of a spherical perturbation in an expanding background .",
    "they introduced for the first time the cosmological expansion and the role of adiabatic invariance in the formation of individual objects .",
    "later , fillmore & goldreich ( 1984 ) found analytical predictions for the density of collapsed objects seeded by scale - free primordial perturbations in a flat universe .",
    "hoffman & shaham ( 1985 ) generalized these solutions to realistic initial conditions in flat and open friedmann models .",
    "some studies have been done to include more realistic dynamics of the growth process ( e.g. padmanabhan 1996 ; avila - reese , firmani & hernndez 1998 ; lokas 2000 ; subramanian , cen & ostriker 2000 ) .",
    "there are plenty of works in the literature using the spherical collapse model to predict the density profiles of dark matter halos mainly focused on explaining their central regions .",
    "for example bertschinger ( 1985 ) used the spherical collapse with shell crossing to obtain the density profiles resulting from initial power law density profiles .",
    "lokas & hoffman ( 2000 ) considered more general initial profiles .",
    "the effect of non - radial motions has also been widely treated ( see ryden & gunn 1987 ; gurevich & zybin 1988 ; avila - reese et al .",
    "1998 ; white & zaritsky 1992 ; sikivie et al .  1997 ; nusser 2001 ; hiotelis 2001 ) .",
    "some of these authors have used arbitrary initial profiles , while others have assumed the mean initial profile around density maxima ( bardeen et al .",
    "1986 , bbks ) .",
    "in all these works angular momentum is introduced by hand , although more recently it has been done in a more natural way ( nusser 2001 ; ascasibar et al .",
    "2004 ) . concerning to the outer parts of the dark matter halos , only barkana ( 2004 )",
    "has adopted an appropriate initial profile , but only for a restricted type of density profile ( the typical profile ) .",
    "the more recent work by prada et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have obtained predictions for the mean and most probable density profiles and have provided a detailed comparison with cosmological simulations .",
    "a proper understanding of the physics of dark matter halos involves predicting correctly not only the mean halo density profile for any given mass but also the whole probability distribution for the enclosed density contrast at any given radii , @xmath0 . a first attempt to determine it can be found in prada et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , where it has been shown to be generally in good agreement with the cosmological simulations . nevertheless , this probability distribution shows , at any radius , a longer tail for large values of @xmath11 , as compared to that from simulations at any radius .",
    "in this paper we present a more accurate prediction for the probability distribution @xmath0 that constitutes the main new result of this work .",
    "we also give in detail the theoretical background of the predictions presented in prada et al .",
    "the agreement of our new predictions with the simulations is excellent even in the tail of the distribution .",
    "furthermore , we also compute the radial velocity probability distribution and the mean radial velocity profile .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present our theoretical framework and obtain the typical density profile of dark matter halos . in section 3",
    "we show in detail how to obtain the probability distribution for the spherically - averaged enclosed density contrast at a given radii , @xmath0 , presented in prada et al .",
    "the most probable and mean profiles are derived . in section 4 ,",
    "we compute the probability distribution and mean profile for the spherically averaged radial velocity . in section 5 ,",
    "we obtain more accurate probability distributions than that used in the previous sections , and compare again with that found in the simulations .",
    "final remarks are given in section 6 .",
    "the present spherically - averaged enclosed density profiles attains a density contrast value of @xmath16 at certain radius , the so called virial radius . at larger radii",
    "the density contrast must be , by definition , smaller than @xmath16 , otherwise the virial radius would be larger than its nominal value .",
    "we shall now make some comments on the values of @xmath16 and @xmath4 that we use : although at several virial radius the spherically - averaged enclosed linear and actual densities are related by the spherical collapse model , the same does not apply within the virial radius .",
    "the spherically - averaged enclosed density contrast within one virial radius , @xmath16 , and the corresponding enclosed linear density contrast , @xmath4 , are not related as homologous quantities at larger radii , because at one virial radius shell crossing has already becomes important .",
    "consequently , the value of @xmath4 corresponding to @xmath16=340 ( the value we adopted to define the virial radius ) is somewhat uncertain . as a result of work still in progress",
    "we will be able to provide the precise values for @xmath4 and determine its possible small dependence on mass .",
    "here we use for all masses @xmath4=1.9 , a value that leads to very good results and that may be inferred from the fact that when @xmath16=180 , @xmath4 seems to be close to 1.68 for all cosmologies @xcite .",
    "it must be noted that for all our predictions it is irrelevant whether the value of @xmath16 that we use actually corresponds to the virial density contrast or not . by virial density contrast",
    "is usually meant the enclosed density contrast within the largest radii so that we have statistical equilibrium .",
    "the precise value of @xmath16 corresponding to this definition is still problematic but , to our purposes , it can be chosen freely to define a conventional `` virial radius '' .",
    "since we have used numerical simulations with @xmath16 equal to 340 , we will take the same value by default in all the calculations .",
    "let @xmath17 be a realization of the spherically - averaged initial enclosed density profile around a protohalo ( with a given present virial radius , @xmath18 ) linearly extrapolated to the present , where @xmath19 is the lagrangian distance from the center of the halo to the given point and @xmath20 is an index running over realizations .",
    "any realization of the initial profile may be transformed using the standard spherical collapse model ( without shell - crossing ) .",
    "we can use the relationship between the linear value of the density contrast within a sphere , @xmath21 , and the actual density contrast within that sphere , @xmath11 , for the concordant cosmology ( sheth and tormen ( 2002 ) ) :    @xmath22     \\label{eq1}\\ ] ]    or , rather its inverse function @xmath23 ( patiri et al.(2004 ) expression ( 4 ) ) :    @xmath24    @xmath25    \\label{eq2}\\ ] ]    being @xmath26 the step function : @xmath27    transforming for every shell @xmath21 and @xmath19 into @xmath11 and @xmath28 ( the eulerian radius of the shell ) we may obtain , in parametric form , the initial profile @xmath17 spherically evolved , @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30^{-1/3}q     \\label{eq3}\\ ] ]    this two equations gives @xmath29 implicitly with @xmath19 as parameter .",
    "we must now eliminate all linear profiles leading to present profiles which attains an enclosed density contrast larger than ( or equal to ) @xmath16 at a radii larger than the nominal virial radius .",
    "the ensemble of remaining halos allow us to obtain the predictions of the standard spherical collapse model for any statistics .",
    "for example , we shall obtain the predictions for the mean profile :    @xmath31    that is , the average over all remaining halos ( @xmath32 runs over these halos ) .",
    "we shall also consider the most probable profile , @xmath33 , that is , the profile that associates with every value of @xmath28 the @xmath11 value with the largest probability density .",
    "the procedure described above to obtain the spherical model predictions ( i.e. realizations of the linear profile evolved with expression ( [ eq3 ] ) ) serve mostly to the purpose of clarifying the meaning of those predictions and we only use it as a test to the analytical expressions . in practise , we shall use another procedure to obtain directly @xmath34 , @xmath33 and , in fact , the whole probability distribution for the value of @xmath11 at a given value of r , @xmath0 .    before dealing with the detailed predictions",
    "just mentioned we consider a simpler prediction which shall help clarifying the rest of the work , and which is related to previous approaches @xcite .",
    "consider the ensemble of all halos , @xmath35 , attaining a @xmath11 value equal to @xmath16 at a virial radius and smaller values for larger radii .",
    "if we transform back these profile to their linear counterpart , we obtain the ensemble @xmath36 .",
    "let us now take the average over this ensemble ( now for a fixed value of @xmath19 ) :    @xmath37    evolving this profile by means of the spherical collapse model we obtain a profile which we call typical profile and represent by @xmath38 , that is , this profile is simply the mean profile in the initial conditions spherically evolved .",
    "note that the typical density profile is defined because of its simplicity and not because it constitutes a prediction for any specific statistics of the actual halos .",
    "nevertheless , it should not be very different from the most probable profile .",
    "later we will study how these two profiles differ from each other .",
    "this profile definition is the same as that used by barkana ( 2004 ) , but we use a different approximation to derive it .    to obtain the mean linear density profile @xmath39 subject to the condition that in the present enclosed density profile the virialization density contrast , @xmath16 , is not attained beyond the virial radius , barkana used barrier penetration results .",
    "he obtained the probability distribution for @xmath21(q ) given the conditions :    @xmath40    @xmath41    where @xmath5 is the virial radius ( q the corresponding lagrangian radius ) , and @xmath4 is the linear counterpart of @xmath16 .",
    "then , by averaging over all @xmath21 values smaller than @xmath4 , he obtained the mean linear profile , @xmath39 , with those conditions .",
    "however , he had to make some simplifications , the most relevant one is that he used a sharp filter in k - space , rather than the top hat filter in ordinary space which is the natural one in this context .    in our approach",
    "we first obtain the probability for @xmath2 only with the condition @xmath42 :    @xmath43    where    @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48    where @xmath49 stands for the power spectra of the density fluctuations linearly extrapolated to the present",
    ".    it is convenient to use a simple and accurate approximation for @xmath50 :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is a coefficient depending on the the size of the halo , @xmath1 :    @xmath53    if no restriction other than @xmath42 were imposed on @xmath2 the mean linear profile would be :    @xmath54    however , we are interested on the mean profiles satisfying also @xmath55 for @xmath6 .",
    "so , we must use as mean profile :    @xmath56    @xmath57    for arbitrarily massive halos @xmath58 .",
    "so , since for the relevant @xmath19 values ( @xmath59 ) @xmath60 , @xmath2 is simply given by @xmath61 .",
    "however , for halos with @xmath62 , @xmath2 is substantially steeper than @xmath61 , resulting in steeper present density profiles for smaller masses .",
    "this result has previously been advanced by barkana @xcite and have been confirmed by means of numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "it must be noted that the profile given by expression ( [ eq6 ] ) is not exactly the mean linear profile implicit in the definition of typical profile .",
    "note that at each value of q , @xmath21 is constrained to lay below @xmath4 but the probability distribution upon which this constraint is imposed does not account for the fact that the profile lies below @xmath4 at any other value of q larger than q. this is , however , a good approximation , because the most relevant part of the present density profile ( to @xmath63 10 virial radius ) corresponds to a narrow region in lagrangian coordinates ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath21 for q between q and 1.5q are strongly correlated .",
    "so , if we impose the condition @xmath65 at , for example , @xmath66 , the probability that the same condition holds at any @xmath19 is close to one .",
    "once we have @xmath67 all we need to do is to evolve it with the spherical collapse model . using equations ( [ eq3 ] ) we may write ( patiri et al.(2004 ) expression ( 20 ) ) :    @xmath68^{\\frac{1}{3 } } \\label{eq7}\\ ] ]    where the right hand side of this equation is simply the function defined in expression ( [ eq2 ] ) evaluated at @xmath39 ( given by expression ( [ eq6 ] ) ) . for each value of @xmath28",
    "we must solve this equation for the variable @xmath69 . applying the function defined in expression ( [ eq1 ] ) ,",
    "which is the inverse of that defined in ( [ eq2 ] ) , to both sides of this equation we have :    @xmath70    where the left hand side is expression ( [ eq1 ] ) evaluated at @xmath69 .",
    "this equation is usually simpler to solve than equation ( [ eq7 ] ) and is the one we used in prada et al.(2005 ) .",
    "it must be noted , however , that , if one intends to generate the whole profile rather than to obtain @xmath69 for some specific value of @xmath28 , it is not necessary to solve equation ( [ eq8 ] ) , since one may obtain all couples of values of @xmath69 , @xmath28 using ( [ eq7 ] ) and running over all values of @xmath19 .",
    "the profile obtained in this way is the typical enclosed density contrast profile , @xmath38 . to obtain the typical density contrast profile , @xmath71",
    ", we may use the relationship ( [ eq14 ] ) , given at the end of next section .",
    "at a given value of @xmath28 , @xmath11 takes different values , @xmath35 , over the assemble of halos .",
    "the question now is which is the probability distribution of @xmath11 over this ensemble , p(@xmath11,r ) . as we saw in the previous section ,",
    "this can be done , in principle , by making realizations of the initial profile , @xmath17 , and evolving them accordingly with equations ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "let s assume , as a first approximation , that the realizations of the initial profile may be carried out by generating for each value of q a value of @xmath21 accordingly with distribution ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "that is , we assume that the distribution of @xmath21 is only conditioned by the fact that @xmath42",
    ". we shall latter consider initial profiles with an additional constraint . with these realizations we can elaborate for each value of r a histogram for @xmath0 .",
    "there is , however , a direct analytical procedure to obtain @xmath0 from the probability distribution for @xmath21 ( expression ( [ eq4 ] ) in the present approximation ) .",
    "@xmath11 is a unique function of @xmath21 ( expression ( [ eq2 ] ) ) .",
    "so , one may think that p(@xmath11,r ) can be obtained from ( [ eq4 ] ) simply through the change of variable @xmath72 .",
    "however , expressions ( [ eq3 ] ) show that in transforming the initial profile not only is @xmath21 transformed into @xmath11 , but also @xmath19 is transformed into @xmath28 . now ,",
    "expression ( [ eq4 ] ) gives the distribution of @xmath21 at a fixed @xmath19 value .",
    "but what we want to obtain is the distribution for @xmath11 at a fixed @xmath28 value .",
    "so , since the relationship between @xmath19 and @xmath28 depends on @xmath11 ( or @xmath21 ) itself , it is clear that the derivation of p(@xmath11,r ) from expression ( [ eq4 ] ) ( i.e. from p(@xmath21,q ) ) can not be as simple as described above .",
    "fortunately , there is a simple expression relating both probability distributions , which is valid as long as shell - crossing is not important :    @xmath73    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is given by expression ( [ eq1 ] ) and @xmath76 is the linear profile .",
    "note that @xmath11 enters not only in the integration limit but also in the integrand through @xmath19 .",
    "the derivation of this relationship is given in patiri et al.(2004 ) appendix b. in that work this relationship was derived in regard with void density profiles , so it had an slightly different form . in appendix",
    "b we give the derivation corresponding to the present case .",
    "using expression ( [ eq4 ] ) for p(@xmath21,q ) we find :    @xmath77    @xmath78    @xmath79    with @xmath50 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 as defined in ( [ eq4 ] ) .    for the purposes of this section we may neglect the term @xmath82 .",
    "the full expression shall be used in section 5 along with a more refined one .",
    "we then have :    @xmath83    by construction , @xmath11 at @xmath28 must be smaller than @xmath16 and larger than certain value , @xmath84 :    @xmath85    this minimum value corresponds to a situation where there is no matter in between @xmath5 and @xmath28 .",
    "so , for @xmath11 values outside the interval @xmath86 , @xmath0 is zero .",
    "we may obtain an analytical expression for p(@xmath11,r ) using approximation ( [ eq5 ] ) for @xmath87 and the following approximation for @xmath88 ( which enters @xmath81 , defined below expression ( [ eq4 ] ) ) :    @xmath89    as mentioned before , expression ( [ eq9 ] ) is valid as long as shell - crossing is not important . in prada et al.(2005 ) we have found by mean of comparison with numerical simulations that , beyond three virial radius , the relevance of shell - crossing diminishes quickly .",
    "this relevance can be estimated a priori ( i.e. without comparison with simulations ) obtaining p(@xmath11,r ) directly through realizations of the initial profile accordingly with expression ( [ eq4 ] ) and evolving them accordingly with equations ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "if shell - crossing were irrelevant , the p(@xmath11,r ) obtained in this way should be equal to that given by expression ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "the presence of certain amount of shell - crossing will cause the p(@xmath11,r ) obtained with realization to have a somewhat smaller maxima and a more extended tail than that given by ( [ eq10 ] ) ( note that it is this expression that corresponds to realizations elaborated with expression ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "in this case none of the procedures gives the correct p(@xmath11,r ) because both assume that @xmath11 is related to @xmath21 by means of expression ( [ eq1 ] ) , which is inconsistent when shell - crossing is important .",
    "however , the difference between the results obtained with both procedures is of the same order of the difference between any of them and the profile obtained with a proper treatment of shell - crossing .",
    "note that even this last p(@xmath11,r ) is not the real one , since , as we said before , we are generating the initial profile using only a two point distribution ( expression ( [ eq4 ] ) ) .    in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we compare the p(@xmath11,r ) obtained by the two procedures mentioned above for several values of @xmath28 expressed in unit of the virial radius ( that we denote by s ) .",
    "we also show the corresponding histograms obtained from the numerical simulations described in prada et al.(2005 ) , which were done using the adaptive refinement tree ( art ) code ( kravtsov et al . 1997 ) for the standard @xmath9cdm cosmological model with @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and cover a wide range of scales with different mass and force resolutions ( see prada et al .",
    "2005 for a detailed description ) .",
    "in particular , the histograms in figure 1 were obtained for a total of 654 halos in a mass range of @xmath93 selected without any kind of isolation criteria .",
    "we can see that , for @xmath94 , where shell - crossing is already important , there is substantial difference between the results of both procedures .",
    "a considerable amount of probability is transfered from the most probable value to much larger values ( @xmath95 ) causing the distribution obtained through the realizations to be bimodal .",
    "for @xmath96 there is still a small amount of shell - crossing causing the maxima obtained with both procedures to differ by roughly a 20% . for larger values of @xmath97 this difference steadily diminishes .     as given by expression ( [ eq10 ] ) compared with the corresponding histogram obtained through realizations ( histogram with small error bars ) and that found in the simulations ( histogram with large error bars ) for four values of @xmath98 and a mass of @xmath99 ( @xmath100 and @xmath101).,width=330,height=283 ]    furthermore",
    ", as @xmath97 increases the difference between the distribution given by expression ( [ eq10 ] ) and the histogram obtained with the numerical simulations reduces .",
    "in fact , even for @xmath96 the relative values of p(@xmath11,r ) at different values of @xmath11 to the left of the maxima are very well given by ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "the difference in the absolute values with respect to those in the histogram is due to the normalization .",
    "for @xmath11 values to the right of the maxima , expression ( [ eq10 ] ) gives a considerably more extended tail than in the actual distribution .",
    "therefore the normalization constant is larger in the latter case .",
    "note that , although the maxima of expression ( [ eq10 ] ) and that of the histogram corresponding to the numerical simulations approach as @xmath97 increases , due to the increasing irrelevance of the tail , this tail is still substantially more extended even for @xmath102 .",
    "now , since the relevance of shell - crossing is small for @xmath97 larger than 3 , the most likely explanation for the excess in the tail given by expression ( [ eq10 ] ) lies on the fact that we are using expression ( [ eq4 ] ) for p(@xmath21,q ) . in the last section we shall consider a better p(@xmath11,r ) and discuss the resulting improvement of the behaviour of its tail .    using p(@xmath11,r ) ( as given by ( [ eq10 ] ) ) we may immediately obtain the most probable and the mean profiles .",
    "for the first one we have :    @xmath103    and for the mean profile , in principle :    @xmath104    however , due to the fact that the mean is rather sensitive to the form of the tail , we must artificially cut off the tail . from the simulations we know that the real tail practically ends at @xmath105 with @xmath106 given by :",
    "so , instead of ( [ eq12 ] ) we use ( prada et al.2005 ) :    @xmath108    in table 1 we give the values of @xmath106 and @xmath109 for several values of @xmath98 .",
    "so far we have considered the probability distribution and profiles of the spherically - averaged enclosed density contrast , @xmath11 .",
    "we shall now consider the local density contrast @xmath11 , that is the density contrast within a narrow shell of radius @xmath28 . in this case",
    "we can not obtain p(@xmath11,r ) by mean of a simple relationship like expression ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "however , the mean @xmath11 profile can be obtained from the mean @xmath11 profile . to this end , note that for each actual density profile , that is , for each spherically evolved realization of the linear profile , @xmath35 , the following relationship holds :    @xmath110    which follows immediately from the definitions of @xmath11 , @xmath14 .",
    "the mean @xmath11 profile does not correspond to any actual density profile .",
    "however , being the mean a linear operation , the same relationship holds for the mean profiles :    @xmath111    .artificial cut - off for @xmath0 [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the most probable profile is constructed with the ensemble of profiles @xmath35 by means of a non - linear operation : that of choosing , for any value of r , the member of the ensemble with the largest probability density for @xmath69 .",
    "so , relationship ( [ eq14 ] ) is not valid between @xmath112 and @xmath113 , because the value of @xmath113 at different values of r may correspond to different members of the ensemble .",
    "in prada et al.(2005 ) we have used expression ( [ eq14 ] ) to obtain @xmath112(r ) from @xmath33 and found results in good agreement with the simulations , but this is a posteriori agreement : unlike the prediction for @xmath114 , the value of @xmath112(r ) obtained using expression ( [ eq14 ] ) is not a proper prediction .",
    "in the spherical collapse model , the radial velocity at distance @xmath28 with respect to the center of the spherical cloud is a unique function of the spherically - averaged enclosed density contrast , @xmath69 .",
    "an exact analytical expression may be given for this relationship using @xmath75 ( expression ( [ eq1 ] ) ) .",
    "mass conservation within a shell with initial lagrangian radius @xmath19 , implies that , at any time , the following relationship must hold :    @xmath115    where @xmath116 is the scale factor of the universe ( normalized to 1 at present ) so that the left hand side is the comoving radii of that shell at time @xmath117 .",

    "so , the difference between the actual value of @xmath0 ( the histogram obtained from the simulations ) and that given by expression ( [ eq10 ] ) lies on the fact that this expression is only an approximation , or in the possible relevance of triaxiality , non - radial motions and pressure ( velocity dispersions ) . to determine the amount of the discrepancy due to inaccuracies in the statistical description of the initial conditions as opposed to the discrepancy due to neglected dynamical factors",
    ", we must consider better approximation than that provided by expression ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "we shall use now two improved approximations .",
    "the first one is that obtained by using expression ( [ eq9b ] ) in expression ( [ eq9 ] ) , which we represent by @xmath140 . note that , to derive this approximation we have used the fact that at a given @xmath19 larger than @xmath1 , @xmath141 must be smaller than @xmath4 , but we have used expression ( [ eq4 ] ) for @xmath76 .",
    "this distribution does not account for the fact that for all values of q larger than q , @xmath142 .",
    "consequently , @xmath76 falls off with @xmath21 more slowly than it should and the same applies to @xmath0 . in the second approximation , which we represent by @xmath143",

    "we may check whether @xmath140 is accurate enough , so that the remaining discrepancy of the prediction with the results shown in the simulations may be ascribed to unaccounted dynamical factors .",
    "we have already pointed out that the most relevant part of the present density profile ( up to @xmath144 8 virial radii ) comes from a narrow band in lagrangian coordinates ( from @xmath1 to @xmath144 @xmath145 ) so that the values of @xmath21 within this band are strongly correlated .",
    "this is the reason why using expression ( [ eq4 ] ) for @xmath76 is a good approximation , because if @xmath21 at @xmath19 ( within the mentioned band ) lies below @xmath4 the same will probably be valid also at all @xmath146 larger than @xmath1 .",
    "we go now a step further and explicitly demand that @xmath21 lies below @xmath4 at all lagrangian radii in between @xmath1 and @xmath19 . imposing the same condition at @xmath146 larger than @xmath19 is unnecessary since it will lead to a negligible change for @xmath76 , because if @xmath21 lies below @xmath4 at @xmath19 the same will almost certainly occur at larger distances .",
    "given the strong correlation between the values of @xmath21 in between @xmath1 and @xmath19 ( for the relevant @xmath19 s ) , the condition that for all values of q larger than q @xmath142 , is almost equivalent to demanding that @xmath21 lies below @xmath4 at the middle point @xmath147 .",

    "we have not imposed yet the almost redundant condition ( since @xmath156 is very small for @xmath161 ) that @xmath141 at @xmath19 must be smaller than @xmath4 . the probability distribution for @xmath141 with this condition , @xmath148 , is simply obtained through normalization ( see ( [ eqa5 ] ) )    the distribution for @xmath11 at fixed @xmath28 within this formalism , which we represent by @xmath162 ,",
    "may be obtained from @xmath163 by means of expression ( [ eq9 ] ) , which is valid when shell - crossing is not important ( @xmath164 ) :    @xmath165    @xmath166    in figure [ fig3 ] we show the probability distributions for a mass of @xmath138 at 3.5 and 6.0 virial radius .",
    "as expected , @xmath162 falls off much faster than @xmath0 being in excellent agreement with the simulations .",
    "the tail of @xmath140 falls off sufficiently fast to give sensible results for the density and velocity profiles averaged over all possible halos ( @xmath11 between @xmath136 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "however , we know that for @xmath167 the standard spherical collapse model is not a good approximation , so we can not learn much by comparing simulations with predictions for averages over all halos .",
    "it is more instructive to compare the predictions for the averages corresponding to @xmath11 values between @xmath136 ( expression ( [ eq9c ] ) ) and @xmath168 with those found in the simulations for the same range of @xmath11 values .    in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "we show the predictions given by @xmath0 , @xmath140 , @xmath143 for the @xmath11 profile averaged between @xmath136 and @xmath168 and the averaged found in the simulations . in figure [ fig5 ] the corresponding results for the peculiar infall velocity (",
    "the hubble flow minus the radial velocity ) are presented .",
    "one of the things we learn from these figures is that @xmath143 must differ very little from the exact distribution , since it may be shown on general grounds that the difference between the predictions given by these two distributions must be much smaller than the difference between the predictions given by @xmath143 and @xmath140 .",
    "another thing that we learn is that the spherical collapse model can not be a good approximation for all halos included in the averaging process .",
    "the reason being that only the presence of some considerably triaxial haloes ( i.e. haloes such that the density contours of their outskirts are very triaxial ) within the averaging assemble can explain the fact that the results found in the simulations are somewhat larger than those obtained using @xmath143 . if the dynamical factor that we have neglected were irrelevant the latter results must be slightly above the former .",
    "non - radial motion and velocity dispersions preserve the order , only increasing the difference .",
    "the reason being that when these factors are taken into account , while preserving spherical symmetry , @xmath169 is steeper ( @xmath11 smaller for given @xmath141 ) than in the standard model ( expression ( [ eq1 ] ) ) , resulting , through expression ( [ eq24 ] ) and ( [ eqa8 ] ) in steeper @xmath170 .",
    "so , only the relevance of triaxiality can explain the results shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the effect is not large in this figure , since only a small fraction of the halos are affected , but it is quite meaningful .",
    "it is this very effect that is causing that the peculiar infall velocity profile predicted by means of @xmath143 does not agree with that found in the simulations even at @xmath171 .    knowing that for some halos the spherical collapse model can not be a good approximation",
    ", the relevant question now is to determine precisely how good is it for most halos . to this end , at each radial bin we search for the value , @xmath172 , such that the upper cumulative probability , as given by @xmath143 , is @xmath173 , and eliminate , both in the simulations and in the predictions , halos with larger @xmath11 values at that bin . by doing so",
    ", we eliminate many halos which simply have flatter profiles than average , but are otherwise sufficiently spherical for the model to apply .",
    "but , we are sure of having eliminated all halos with highly triaxial outskirts , most of them corresponding to situations where a couple of halos lie within a few virial radius from each other , so that each of them will show up in the outskirt of the other halo ; a situation that , by no mean , can be described by the spherical model . the resulting profiles , as given by the different approximations to @xmath0 and the simulations are given in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "the difference between the various approximations is now smaller , since the main difference occurs at the far tail ( of @xmath0 ) , which has now been eliminated , but this difference increases for smaller masses .",
    "the profile obtained from the simulations lies now slightly below the best prediction , as it should be if the spherical model is a good approximation . in figure [ fig7 ]",
    "we show the corresponding results for the peculiar infall velocity .",
    "it is apparent that the prediction agrees well with the simulations at large radii but as we go below @xmath144 5 virial radius there is an increasing discrepancy .",
    "this must be due to the unaccounted dynamical factors .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] give us another clue as to the relative effect of these factors .",
    "triaxiality causes the dispersion of @xmath11 at any given radii to increase , since , for a given value of @xmath141 triaxial evolution gives a distribution of @xmath11 values with a finite dispersion , while the spherical model gives a single value .",
    "so , the fact that the dispersion found in the simulations lies somewhat below the predictions , imply that triaxiality can not be dominant amongst unaccounted factors .    in summary ,",
    "the distribution @xmath143 is very close to the exact . to most purposes the simpler distribution @xmath140",
    "may be used , their difference being small , although it increases for smaller values .",
    "the density profiles obtained with @xmath143 are in excellent agreement with those found in simulations beyond @xmath144 3 virial radius . the density dispersion and the radial velocity show some discrepancy below @xmath144 5 virial radius , which clearly indicate the relevance of unaccounted dynamical factors , specially velocity dispersions .",
    "corresponding to the mean @xmath11 profiles ( excluding at each radius the upper 20% @xmath11 values ) obtained using different probability distributions , as shown in fig.[fig6 ] ( same type of lines used here ) ; @xmath174 of the mean @xmath11 obtained from simulations is also given for comparison ( filled line).,width=330,height=283 ]",
    "the spherical collapse model describes very well the properties of dark matter halos beyond three virial radius . this could seem surprising given the fact that the density contours around halos may be considerably aspherical and the presence of tidal fields .    nevertheless , the assumption that the spherically averaged density profiles at several virial radius evolves according with the spherical collapse model is not just a simplification introduced to make the problem tractable .",
    "the mean evolution is given by the spherical collapse model with some dispersion ( for a given @xmath141 ) due to triaxiality .",
    "this have been shown by mean of simulations ( lilje et al .",
    "1986 ) and analytical works ( bernardeau 1994 ) . at sufficiently large radii where @xmath11 is sufficiently small ( @xmath175 )",
    "the fractional dispersion becomes small . at small radii ,",
    "not only the dispersion becomes larger , causing the mean value of @xmath11 for a given @xmath141 to be somewhat different from @xmath176 ( expression ( [ eq1 ] ) ) , but also the effect of non - radial motions and velocity dispersions starts to dominate .",
    "so studying the dark matter profile where the uncertainty of the evolution is small , we may check that the initial conditions we use are correct to a high degree of accuracy . with these conditions , as described by the most accurate probability distribution , @xmath148 , we should be able to obtain very accurate predictions for all possible definitions ( typical , mean ... ) of density and velocity profile .",
    "that is , there is no room for remodeling ; all properties must be explained with one and the same @xmath148 .",
    "any residual discrepancy should be explained by triaxiality , non - radial motions and velocity dispersions , as we shall show in a future work , although , from the results shown in this work , the last two effects dominate at least up to roughly 5 virial radius .",
    "going a step further , if we adequately take into account the neglected dynamical factors , the same initial conditions should explain the profile at any radii . in this way",
    ", we could be able to explain the dark matter profiles at least down to a virial radii understanding the role played by the initial conditions and by the different processes relevant to the evolution .",

    "<S> in the present work we describe the formalism necessary to derive the properties of dark matter halos beyond two virial radius using the spherical collapse model ( without shell crossing ) , and provide the framework for the theoretical prediction presented in prada et al .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2005 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show in detail how to obtain within this model the probability distribution for the spherically - averaged enclosed density at any radii @xmath0 . using this probability distribution </S>",
    "<S> , we compute the most probable and mean density profiles , which turns out to differ considerably from each other . </S>",
    "<S> we also show how to obtain the typical profile , as well as the probability distribution and mean profile for the spherically averaged radial velocity . </S>",
    "<S> three probability distributions are obtained : a first one is derived using a simple assumption , that is , if @xmath1 is the virial radius in lagrangian coordinates , then the enclosed linear contrast @xmath2 must satisfy the condition that @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the linear density contrast within the virial radius @xmath5 at the moment of virialization </S>",
    "<S> . then we introduce an additional constraint to obtain a more accurate @xmath0 which reproduces to a higher degree of precision the distribution of the spherically averaged enclosed density found in the simulations . </S>",
    "<S> this new constraint is that , for a given @xmath6 , @xmath7 . a third probability distribution , the most accurate , </S>",
    "<S> is obtained imposing the strongest constraint that @xmath8 , which means that there are no radii larger than @xmath5 where the density contrast is larger than that used to define the virial radius . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compare our theoretical predictions for the mean density and mean velocity profiles with the results found in the simulations . </S>"
