    "<S> it is known that a quantum computer operating on electron - spin qubits with single - electron hamiltonians and assisted by single - spin measurements can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer . </S>",

    "<S> these enable the construction of a cnot ( controlled not ) gate for free fermions , using only beam splitters and spin rotations . </S>",
    "<S> the gate is nearly deterministic if the charge detector counts the number of electrons in a mode , and fully deterministic if it only measures the parity of that number .    </S>",
    "<S> flying qubits transport quantum information between distant memory nodes and form an essential ingredient of a scalable quantum computer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> flying qubits could be photons @xcite , but using conduction electrons in the solid state for this purpose removes the need to convert material qubits to radiation . since the coulomb interaction between free electrons is strongly screened , an interaction - free mechanism for logical operations on electronic flying qubits could be desirable . </S>",
    "<S> the search for such a mechanism is strongly constrained by a no - go theorem @xcite , which states that the exponential speed - up of quantum over classical algorithms can not be reached with single - electron hamiltonians assisted by single - spin measurements . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that the full power of quantum computation is restored if single - charge measurements are added . </S>",
    "<S> these enable the construction of a cnot ( controlled not ) gate for free fermions , using only beam splitters and spin rotations .    </S>",
    "<S> the no - go theorem @xcite applies only to fermions  not to bosons . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in an influential paper @xcite , knill , laflamme , and milburn showed that the exponential speed - up over a classical algorithm afforded by quantum mechanics can be reached using only linear optics with single - photon detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the detectors interact with the qubits , providing the nonlinearity needed for the computation , but qubit - qubit interactions ( e.g.nonlinear optical elements ) are not required in the bosonic case . </S>",
    "<S> this difference between bosons and fermions explains why the topic of `` free - electron quantum computation '' ( feqc ) is absent in the literature  in contrast to the active topic of `` linear optics quantum computation '' ( loqc ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we would like to open up the former topic , by demonstrating how the constraint on the efficiency of quantum algorithms for free fermions can be removed . </S>",
    "<S> we accomplish this by using the fact that the electron carrying the qubit in its spin degree of freedom has also a charge degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> spin and charge commute , so a measurement of the charge leaves the spin qubit unaffected . to measure the charge </S>",
    "<S> the qubit should interact with a detector , but no qubit - qubit interactions are needed .    </S>",
    "<S> charge detectors play a prominent role in a variety of contexts : as which - path detectors they control the visibility of aharonov - bohm oscillations @xcite ; in combination with a beam splitter they provide a way to entangle two noninteracting particles @xcite ; in combination with spin - dependent tunneling they enable the read - out of a spin qubit @xcite . the experimental realization uses the effect of the electric field of the charge on the conductance of a nearby point contact @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is weak , because of screening , but measurable if the point contact is near enough . </S>",
    "<S> such a device functions as an _ electrometer : _ it can count the occupation number of a spatial mode ( 0 , 1 , or 2 electrons with opposite spin ) . if the point contact is replaced by a quantum dot with a resonant conductance , then it is possible to operate the device as a _ parity meter : _ it can distinguish occupation number 1 ( when it is on resonance ) from occupation number 0 or 2 ( when it is off resonance )  but it can not distinguish between 0 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> we will consider both types of charge detectors in what follows .    </S>",
    "<S> the general formulation of fermionic quantum computation @xcite is in terms of local modes which can be either empty or occupied . </S>",
    "<S> the annihilation operator of a local mode is @xmath0 , with spatial mode index @xmath1 and spin index @xmath2 . for noninteracting fermions </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian is bilinear in the creation and annihilation operators . </S>",
    "<S> a local measurement in the computational basis has projection operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> terhal and one of the authors @xcite showed that the probability of the outcome of any set of such local measurements is the square root of a determinant . since a determinant of order @xmath5 can be evaluated in a time which scales polynomially with @xmath5 , the quantum algorithm can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer . </S>",
    "<S> this is the no - go theorem mentioned in the introduction .    </S>",
    "<S> we now add measurements of the local charge @xmath6 to the algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues of @xmath7 are @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the probability that charge 1 is measured is given by the expectation value of the projection operator @xmath9 the operator @xmath10 is the sum of two local operators in the computational basis . the probability that @xmath11 spatial modes are singly occupied therefore consists of a sum of an exponentially large number ( @xmath12 ) of determinants , so now a classical simulation need no longer scale polynomially with the number of modes . </S>",
    "<S> notice that a measurement of @xmath7 contains less information about the state than separate measurements of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that partial measurements can add computational power is a basic principle of quantum algorithms @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now see how these formal considerations could be implemented , by constructing a cnot gate using only beam splitters , spin rotations , and charge detectors . to construct the gate we need one of two new building blocks that are enabled by charge detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the first building block is the bell - state analyzer shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ bellanalyzer ] . for this device it does nt matter whether the charge detector operates as an electrometer or as a parity meter . </S>",
    "<S> the second building block , shown in fig .  [ encoder ] , converts a charge parity measurement to a spin parity measurement . </S>",
    "<S> we present each device in turn and then show how to construct the cnot gate .    </S>",
    "<S> the bell - state analyzer makes it possible to teleport @xcite the spin state @xmath15 of electron @xmath16 to another electron @xmath17 , using a third electron @xmath18 that is entangled with @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the teleportation is performed by measuring the joint state of @xmath16 and @xmath18 in the bell basis @xmath19 a no - go theorem @xcite says that such a bell measurement can not be done deterministically ( meaning with 100% success probability ) without using interactions between the qubits . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been noted that this theorem does not apply to qubits that possess an additional degree of freedom @xcite , and that is how we will work around it .     and @xmath20 ) , and three charge detectors ( squares ) . </S>",
    "<S> the charge detectors may operate either as electrometers ( counting the occupation @xmath21 in an arm ) or as parity meters ( measuring @xmath22 modulo 2 ) . the first charge detector can identify the spin singlet state @xmath23 , which is the only one of the four bell states ( [ psi0])([psi2 ] ) to show bunching ( @xmath24 ) . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath25 , the second charge detector can identify @xmath26 when @xmath27 . finally , since @xmath28 , the third charge detector can identify the two remaining states @xmath29 ( when @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 ( when @xmath32 ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ bellanalyzer ] , width=302 ]     and @xmath33 . a polarizing beam splitter </S>",
    "<S> ( double dashed line ) transmits spin up and reflects spin down . </S>",
    "<S> a charge detector records bunching ( @xmath34 ) or antibunching ( @xmath35 ) and passes the electrons on to a second polarizing beam splitter . </S>",
    "<S> if each electron at the input is in a spin eigenstate @xmath36 or @xmath37 , then output equals input and @xmath38 measures the spin parity ( @xmath35 if the two spins are aligned , @xmath34 if they are opposite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the gate can be used to encode a qubit @xmath36 as the two - particle state @xmath39 and @xmath37 as @xmath40 . for that purpose </S>",
    "<S> the input consists of the qubit to be encoded in arm @xmath41 plus an ancilla in arm @xmath33 in the state @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the output is the required two - particle state in arms @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath34 it becomes the required state after a spin - flip ( @xmath45 ) operation on the electron in arm @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> [ encoder ] , width=302 ]    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ bellanalyzer ] we show how a deterministic bell measurement for fermions can be performed using three 50/50 beam splitters , three charge detectors , and two local spin rotations ( represented by pauli matrices @xmath45 and @xmath20 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the beam splitter scatters two electrons into the same arm ( bunching ) if they are in the singlet state ( [ psi0 ] ) , and into two different arms ( antibunching ) if they are in one of the triplet states ( [ psi1])([psi3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( this can be easily understood @xcite from the antisymmetry of the wave function under particle exchange , demanded by the pauli principle : the singlet state is antisymmetric in the spin degree of freedom , so the spatial part of the wave function should be symmetric , and vice versa for the triplet state . ) </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath46 be the charge @xmath47 measured by detector @xmath48 , modulo 2 . </S>",
    "<S> so @xmath49 means bunching and @xmath50 means antibunching after beam splitter @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath51 takes on the value @xmath8 , or @xmath52 depending on whether the incident state is @xmath23 , @xmath26 , @xmath29 , or @xmath31 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of @xmath53 is therefore the required projective measurement in the bell basis . </S>",
    "<S> it is a destructive measurement , so it does not matter whether the charge detector operates as an electrometer ( measuring @xmath47 ) or as a parity meter ( measuring @xmath46 ) .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ encoder ] we show how a charge detector operating as a parity meter can be used to measure in a nondestructive way whether two spins are the same or opposite . </S>",
    "<S> `` nondestructive '' means without measuring whether the spin is up or down . </S>",
    "<S> the device consists of two polarizing beam splitters in series , with the charge detector in between . </S>",
    "<S> ( a polarizing beam splitter fully transmits @xmath54 and fully reflects @xmath55 . ) at the input two electrons are incident in different arms . </S>",
    "<S> input equals output if each electron is in a spin eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> the measured charge parity then records whether the two spins are the same or opposite . </S>",
    "<S> we will refer to this device as an _ encoder _ , because it can deterministically entangle a qubit in the arbitrary state @xmath15 and an ancilla in the fixed state @xmath42 into the two - particle entangled state @xmath56 .    to construct a cnot gate using the bell - state analyzer </S>",
    "<S> we follow ref . , where it was shown that teleportation can be used to convert a probabilistic logical gate into a nearly deterministic one . </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that a probabilistic cnot gate can be constructed from beam splitters and single - qubit operations . </S>",

    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has success probability @xmath57 and works for fermions as well as bosons . </S>",
    "<S> it consumes an entangled pair of ancillas , which can be created probabilistically using a beam splitter and charge detector @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because the gate is not deterministic , it can not be used in a scalable way inside the computation . however , the cnot gate can be repeatedly executed offline , independent of the progress of the quantum algorithm , until it has succeeded . </S>",
    "<S> two bell measurements teleport the cnot operation into the computation @xcite , when needed . in this way </S>",

    "<S> the outcome of that measurement together with the two parities @xmath59 measured by the charge detectors determine which operations @xmath60 one has to apply to control and target at the output in order to complete the cnot operation . for the control , @xmath61 if @xmath27 while @xmath62 if @xmath63 . </S>",
