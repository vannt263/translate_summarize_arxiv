    "normal nuclei are made of protons and neutrons . if hyperon carrying strangeness",
    "is added into a nucleus somehow , we then obtain hypernuclei .",
    "the first hypernucleus was seen in emulsion by danysz and pniewski@xcite in 1953 . since then",
    ", strangeness carried by s - quark opens a new dimension for the studies in nuclear physics . in recent years , exploring nuclear system with strangeness , i.e. , strange matter has received increasing interest .",
    "such system has many astrophysical and cosmological implications and is indeed interesting by itself .",
    "for instance , the core of neutron stars may contain a high fraction of hyperons@xcite , resulting in a third family of compact stars which has a similar mass to neutron star but has a much smaller radius than the later@xcite .",
    "the strange matter may also be formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "there are two kinds of strange matter : strange quark matter and strange hadronic matter . on one hand , it has been speculated@xcite that lumps of quark matter ( `` strangelets '' ) with large strangeness per baryon might be more stable than the normal nuclei .",
    "the experimental work searching for strange quark matter has been going on in bnl - ags and cern - sps @xcite .",
    "but unfortunately , the evidence for the production of strangelets has not yet been observed within the experimental limits . on the other hand , strange hadronic matter or hypernuclei",
    "have also been investigated @xcite .",
    "but the inclusion of multiple units of strangeness in nuclei remains rather largely unexplored yet .",
    "this is because the technical difficulty experimentally and the uncertainty of the interactions between baryons theoretically .",
    "recently , takahashi et al.@xcite reported their observation of a @xmath4he double hypernucleus , where the @xmath5 interaction energy @xmath6mev is deduced from measured data .",
    "this value is much smaller than the previous estimation @xmath7mev from the early experiments@xcite . to incorporate the early strong y - y interaction , the @xmath0 well depth in `` @xmath0 matter '' at density",
    "@xmath8 was estimated as @xmath9 mev by using the nijmegen model d.@xcite .",
    "if the new value @xmath10mev is used , the @xmath11 mev is obtained .",
    "the measurement of @xmath12 was also performed in bnl , but they did not obtain the interaction between the lambdas .    although qcd is the fundamental theory for strong interaction , it is not available to describe strange hadronic matter directly because of its non - perturbative properties .",
    "two kinds of effective models had been introduced .",
    "the first kind is focused on the chiral su(3 ) symmetry@xcite .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a generalized lagrangian which is based on the linear realization of chiral su(3 ) symmetry and the concept of broken scale invariance was proposed to describe the shm .",
    "the second kind is based upon the successful models of nuclear matter , for example , walecka model@xcite , quark - meson coupling(qmc ) model@xcite , or furnstahl - serot - tang(fst ) model@xcite , and adding hyperons into these models . in refs.@xcite and @xcite , two models ( denoted as model 1 and model 2 ) which are based on a su(3 ) extension of the walecka model",
    "are suggested to deal with the weak and strong y - y interaction . in particular , in the model 2 , in order to incorporate the early strong y - y interaction data@xcite , two additional mesons , namely , @xmath13 and @xmath3 mesons are introduced to obtain the strong attraction between @xmath0 hyperons .",
    "the advantage of this treatment is that it can easily reduce to an effective model which can explain the nuclear systems very well when the hyperons are taken away , because the coupling constants between nucleons and mesons are determined by the experimental data of nuclear system . in this sense",
    ", the effect of hyperons can be exposed explicitly .",
    "of course , part of the second kind of models suffer from the loss of chiral su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "in fact , the treatment for adding hyperons to nuclear system to study the hypernuclei , for example , @xmath0 hypernuclei has been employed by many previous papers .",
    "recently , by using an extended modified quark meson coupling(mqmc ) model we studied the implications@xcite of the newest y - y interaction in strange hadronic matter .",
    "it is found that while the system with the strong @xmath5 interaction and in a quite large strangeness fraction region is more deeply bound than the ordinary nuclear matter due to the opening of the new degrees of freedom , the system with the weak @xmath5 interaction is rather loosely bound compared to the later .",
    "it is interesting to check if the above remarks depend on the model used and to see what happens if the system is at finite temperature . in a previous paper@xcite",
    ", we suggested an effective model , constructed by introducing hyperons in the furnstahl - serot - tang(fst ) model , to study the saturation properties and stabilities of strange hadronic matter at both zero@xcite and finite temperature@xcite . in this work",
    ", we will use the extended fst model to study warm strange hadronic matter with the newest weak y - y interactions and then compare the results to those@xcite with previous strong y - y interactions .",
    "the details of this model can be found in ref.@xcite , here we only give a short description .",
    "considering reactions , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and their reverses , we take the mixture of the cascades @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the strange matter into our model , besides lambdas . for simplicity , we assume that @xmath16 and @xmath17 will appear in the strange matter with equal amount .",
    "this is similar to the protons and neutrons in symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "we used , therefore , a single symbol @xmath18 for these particles .",
    "furthermore , we have also include the @xmath19 and @xmath20 mesons in the model to describe the interaction between hyperons , as proposed by schaffner et al.@xcite .",
    "we will not consider the mixture of the @xmath21 hyperons in the same reason as mentioned in ref.@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we will gives a brief description of the model .",
    "the calculated results and some discussions will be presented in section iii .",
    "in our previous paper @xcite , the original fst model@xcite was extended by including @xmath0 and @xmath1 hyperons in the system and introducing a new hyperon - hyperon interaction mediated by two additional strange mesons @xmath13 and @xmath3 which couple only to hyperons , just as we stated in the introduction section .",
    "since we will study the unpolarized system , the @xmath22 meson has no influence on the system . omitting the contributions from the @xmath22 meson",
    ", we have the following lagrangian density for the fst model .",
    "@xmath23 where @xmath24 are the coupling constants of the baryons to the meson fields . @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the @xmath27 field and the @xmath20 field strength tensor , respectively .",
    "the scalar fluctuation field @xmath28 is related to @xmath29 by @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 is linked to the mass of the light scalar @xmath29 by the relation @xmath32 . for the symmetric matter considered here",
    ", there is no contribution from @xmath33 meson field . in mean field approximation ,",
    "the lagrangian density then takes the form @xmath34 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the meson field operators are replaced by their mean field values : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . to derive the equation of state at finite temperature",
    ", we calculate the thermodynamic potential @xmath39 by using the standard technique in the field theory and statistical mechanics .",

    "fig.7 shows the same curves as in fig.6 but with @xmath118 . in this case",
    ", the inflection point appears around @xmath107 .",
    "this again indicates the system with large strangeness fraction is less stable than the one with small strangeness fraction when the y - y interaction is weak . on contrary , in the strong y - y interaction",
    ", the inflection point appears at a temperature a little higher than 12 mev for @xmath124 and around 25 mev for @xmath118(see ref.@xcite ) .    in summary , we have extended an effective model describing strange hadronic matter to finite temperature and then used it to discuss the properties of multi - hyperon nuclear matter at finite temperature .",
    "it is found the strange hadronic matter with different y - y interactions behaves very different . while the system with the strong y - y interactions and in a quite large strangeness fraction region is more stable than the ordinary nuclear matter , the system with the weak y - y interactions is less stable than the later .",
    "this conclusion is not model dependent and true for both zero and finite temperature .",
    "if the weak @xmath5 interaction is reliable , then the previous studies on strange hadronic matter and its consequences should be reexamined . in particular , if one hope to extend above discussions from infinite strange hardronic matter to finite hypernuclei , the coulomb interaction must be considered@xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to perform further precise measurements of double hypernuclei .",
