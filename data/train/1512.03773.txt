    "nuclear level densities are important input in the theory of low - energy nuclear reactions . in situations",
    "where the reactions can not be studied in the laboratory , the need for a reliable theory is evident .",
    "the calculation of level densities in the presence of correlations is a challenging problem .",
    "part of the problem is the complexity and inadequate knowledge of the nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "but even with a known hamiltonian , it is often necessary to make approximations based on mean - field theory whose accuracy is not well understood .",
    "our goal here is to assess these mean - field approximations by taking the hamiltonian as known and testing them against a theory that is accurate up to well - controlled statistical errors .",
    "most treatments of the level density of heavy nuclei start from a mean - field theory in the form of the finite - temperature hartree - fock ( hf ) or the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approximation .",
    "the finite - temperature theory is derived from a variational principle based on the grand potential as a function of an uncorrelated trial density  @xcite .",
    "these approximations have been widely applied and taken as a starting point for more sophisticated theories  @xcite .",
    "it would thus be useful to validate them by comparing with a more accurate method .",
    "the auxiliary - field monte carlo method , known as the shell model monte carlo ( smmc ) in nuclear physics  @xcite , fulfills this role .",
    "given the hamiltonian and a model space , the only inaccuracy is a controllable statistical error associated with the monte carlo sampling . as a finite - temperature method , smmc is particularly suitable for the calculation of level densities  @xcite .",
    "the smmc starts from a hamiltonian that is somewhat restricted but which reproduces all the long - range correlations in a realistic way .",
    "these include deformations , pairing gaps and low - energy collective excitations .",
    "it is thus well - suited to provide a benchmark for testing the validity of the mean - field treatments of nuclear thermal and statistical properties .",
    "we note that the smmc applies to all nuclei irrespective of whether they are deformed or spherical and independently of the existence of a mean - field pairing condensate .",
    "in contrast , the formulas for level densities in hf and hfb depend on the character of the mean - field solution .    in sec .",
    "[ statistical ] we summarize the statistical and thermodynamic tools we will use for the analysis and comparisions . in sec .",
    "[ smmc ] we present in some detail the results of the ssmc calculations for two nuclei , namely  and .",

    "[ conclusion ] we summarize our findings regarding the accuracy of the hf and hfb approximations with some remarks on prospects for extending the mean - field approach to level densities .",

    "the quantity that is most directly computed is the thermal energy @xmath5 of the canonical ensemble .",

    "for approximate theories such as the hf and hfb , the only consistent way ( in the sense of appendix ii ) to carry out the reduction is the variation - after - projection method ( vap ) , but this is difficult andm as far as we know , has never been put into practice for calculating level densities in heavy nuclei .",
    "we will therefore only consider simpler reduction methods , recognizing that they can not be free from ambiguity .    a straightforward way to determine a canonical entropy is to separate the 3-d saddle - point integration eq .",

    "<S> we assess the accuracy of finite - temperature mean - field theory using as a standard the hamiltonian and model space of the shell model monte carlo calculations . </S>",
    "<S> two examples are considered : the nucleus @xmath0dy , representing a heavy deformed nucleus , and @xmath1sm , representing a nearby heavy spherical nucleus with strong pairing correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the errors inherent in the finite - temperature hartree - fock and hartree - fock - bogoliubov approximations are analyzed by comparing the entropies of the grand canonical and canonical ensembles , as well as the level density at the neutron resonance threshold , with shell model monte carlo ( smmc ) calculations , which are accurate up to well - controlled statistical errors . </S>",
    "<S> the main weak points in the mean - field treatments are seen to be : ( i ) the extraction of number - projected densities from the grand canonical ensembles , and ( ii ) the symmetry breaking by deformation or by the pairing condensate . in the absence of a pairing condensate </S>",
    "<S> , we confirm that the usual saddle - point approximation to extract the number - projected densities is not a significant source of error compared to other errors inherent to the mean - field theory . </S>",
    "<S> we also present an alternative formulation of the saddle - point approximation that makes direct use of an approximate particle - number projection and avoids computing the usual three - dimensional jacobian of the saddle - point integration . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the pairing condensate is less amenable to approximate particle - number projection methods due to the explicit violation of particle - number conservation in the pairing condensate . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory is accurate to less than one unit of entropy for @xmath1sm at the neutron threshold energy , which is above the pairing phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> this result provides support for the commonly used `` back - shift '' approximation , treating pairing as only affecting the excitation energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> when the ground state is strongly deformed , the hartree - fock entropy is significantly lower than the smmc entropy at low temperatures due to the missing contribution of rotational degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> however , treating the rotational bands in a simple model , we find that the entropy at moderate excitation energies is reproduced to within two units , corresponding to an error in the level density of less than an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with a discussion of methods that have been advocated as beyond the mean field approximation , and their prospects to ameliorate the issues we have identified . </S>"
