    "<S> zero _ gap at the @xmath45-point.@xcite therefore the presence of any type of time - reversal breaking impurity or defects , with strength as small as infinitesimal value will destroy the protection , and thus barring the exciting usefulness of topologically protected transport properties . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the present spin - orbit order is not only protected by symmetry , but most importantly it is thermodynamically shielded with a condensation energy equal to the tunable and large gap . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it would require a sufficiently large value of magnetic field such that its associated zeeman energy @xmath59 ( @xmath29 is ` g'-factor , @xmath60 is bohr magneton ) ] can overcome the condensation gap energy . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) spin de - phasing time @xmath8 which is an important ingredient for the spintronics and quantum computing applications is considerably larger here ( determined by @xmath6 energy ) , and is tunable . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) another crucial benefit of the interaction induced spin - orbit effect is that , unlike in typical electric field or magnetic field induced soc , it does not necessarily activate a charge flow , and thus will be highly valuable for solely generating spin - transport .    </S>",
    "<S> another experimental verification of the broken symmetry spin - orbit order is detection of spin nernst effect . </S>",
    "<S> since nernst effect is sensitive to reconstructed fs , a manifestation of broken symmetry phase,@xcite spin - orbit order will generate a spin - resolved thermal current which are detectable in recent days laboratory facilities.@xcite    the author is grateful to m. j. graf , a. v. balatsky , j .- x . </S>",
