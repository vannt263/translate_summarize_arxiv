    "studies of the emission lines in seyfert galaxies have indicated the presence of two different regions : a region of very high density with large velocity spread  the broad line region ( blr ) , and a region of low gas density with a much smaller velocity spread  the narrow line region ( nlr ) . however , there is also a set of forbidden lines of extremely high excitation , the so - called ` coronal ' lines which includes for instance , , ,  and .",
    "most models favor photoionization over collisional ionization as excitation mechanism ( e.g.  korista & ferland 1989 ; oliva et  al.1994 ; moorwood et  al .",
    "earlier models considered that the filling factor of the coronal gas approached unity with a density lower than that of the nlr . the advent of far infrared measurements of the density sensitive  14.3@xmath1m/24.3@xmath1 m  line ratio with iso ( moorwood et  al .",
    "1996 : mo96 ) , however , suggests much higher densities of @xmath2  implying a very low volume filling factor for the coronal gas . in paper",
    "i , binette et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) proposed that these lines originate from individual gas clouds  as for the nlr  but characterized by an unusually high ionization parameter ,  [ cf .",
    "equation  ( 1 ) below ] .",
    "a similar gas geometry underlies the extensive grid of photoionization models of ferguson , korista & ferland ( 1997 ) . in paper",
    "i , the clouds responsible for the coronal lines are always matter - bounded while they are essentially ionization - bounded in the models of ferguson et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) or in the photoevaporing dusty cloud model of pier & voit ( 1995 ) .",
    "one advantage of the matter - bounded clouds is that they are easier to accelerate by radiation pressure owing to their lower mass .",
    "since the coronal lines are known to be systematically blueshifted in seyfert galaxies ( penston et  al .  1984 )",
    "relative to the systemic velocity ( by 35  in the case of circinus , see oliva et  al .",
    "1994 ; hereafter osmm ) , our justification of using matter - bouneded clouds was to account for this property by incorporating self - consistently the effect of radiation pressure in our cloud model .",
    "the ionization parameters required to fit the very high excitation coronal lines is very high , @xmath3 , implying that the pressure exerted by the ionizing radiation exceeds the gas pressure ( see paper  i ) .",
    "this has two interesting consequences : first , the photoionized cloud can be radially accelerated until the ram presure it exerts on the ambient medium equals the pressure of the latter , this would account for the blueshift of the coronal lines for certain geometries , second , a density gradient arises within the clouds due to radiation pressure ( a distributed force ) and as shown in paper  i , the density stratification generated in this way leads to a wider range in excitation of the ionization species present in the cloud .",
    "the question addressed in this letter is whether the pressure from the nuclear radiation field is sufficient to cause a strong radial acceleration of the clouds despite the gravitational pull exerted by the stars and the nuclear black hole .",
    "the multipurpose code mappings  ic was used to compute the photoionization models .",
    "the atomic data is taken from a compilation of ralph sutherland ( cf .",
    "appendix in ferruit et  al .",
    "the uncertainties in collision strengths of many coronal lines are often large ( see review by oliva 1997 and the discussion of the ` iron conundrum ' by fkf ) and may dominate the errors in the predicted line strengths .      as is customary and in the absence of other information",
    ", the abundances adopted will be solar ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) but depleted according to the dust content .",
    "the latter is defined by the quantity  which is the dust - to - gas ratio of the plasma expressed in units of the solar neighborhood dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "the effects of dust on the thermal and ionization structure are taken into account ( binette et  al .",
    "1993 ) . however , a different depletion scheme is defined whereby the destruction of dust grains is assumed to return uniformly the depleted elements ( ` uniform return ' ) .",
    "for instance , supposing = 0.1 ( i.e. 10% of the solar neighborhood dust content ) , the gas phase abundances are derived from the fully depleted set of abundances ( @xmath41 ) to which we restitute 90% of what has been depleted .",
    "this means that even for the heavily depleted elements like ca , the gas phase abundance when = 0.1 is 90% solar .",
    "the justification behind this is that small values of  are not the result of a different dust formation history but rather that of recent destruction ( of normally formed dust ) by sputtering , sublimation or optical erosion .",
    "we adopt a similar ionizing continuum as in paper  i , namely a powerlaw of index @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) for the infrared - uv domain .",
    "this powerlaw joins at 2000_ev _  with a flatter powerlaw of index @xmath7 to cover the x - ray domain .",
    "we impose a high energy cut - off of 100_kev_(see mathews & ferland 1987 ) .",
    "as is customary , we define the ionization parameter  as the ratio between the density of impinging ionizing photons and the gas density at the face of the cloud @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the monochromatic energy flux impinging on the cloud , @xmath10 the lyman frequency ,  the number of ionizing photons incident on the slab per @xmath11 per second , @xmath12 the speed of light and @xmath13 the total gas density at the irradiated surface of the slab ( all quantities relevant to the irradiated surface carry @xmath14 as a superscript or subscript ) .",
    "we adopt the formalism developed by mathews ( 1986 ) and consider that our radially accelerated cloud has achieved internal hydrostatic equilibrium in the radial ( outward ) direction in the noninertial accelerating frame .",
    "therefore , across a cloud ( hereafter approximated as a slab ) of total column density @xmath15 and situated at a distance @xmath16 from the black hole ( bh ) , we have @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the proton mass , @xmath19 the local _ radiative _ acceleration due to radiation pressure ,  the gravitational acceleration due to the central massive bh and the inner stars , and @xmath20 the instantaneous acceleration of the entire cloud . the volume force exerted by radiation pressure",
    "is simply @xmath21 with its numerical expression in terms of photoelectric cross sections defined in appendix a.3 of paper  i. the clouds geometrical thickness is considered negligible as compared to nuclear distance @xmath16 , a good approximation in the current context of moderately thick clouds .",
    "this implies that for a cloud at @xmath16 , the modified acceleration @xmath22 is constant across its thickness @xmath15 .",
    "we can regard @xmath23 as an eigenvalue for the acceleration of the cloud . in our scheme , the systematic shift towards the blue of the lines requires that @xmath24 , that is @xmath25 in equation  ( 2 ) .",
    "the blueshift can either be the result of an earlier acceleration of the clouds ( the clouds have reached their terminal velocity against the opposing drag and gravitational forces ) , or of ongoing cloud acceleration .      independently of whether the acceleration corresponds to bulk motion or to inertial acceleration , @xmath23 is an important parameter for the cloud s density structure . in our model",
    ", we express this input parameter in terms of the dimensionless quantity @xmath26 defined as @xmath27 with  the radiative acceleration at the irradiated face .",
    "as described in appendix of paper  i , mappings integrate equation  ( 2 ) as well as simultaneously solve for the local ionization and thermal balance as a function of depth @xmath28 .",
    "if  is sufficiently high , equation  ( 2 ) implies a positive pressure gradient within the slab therefore leading to a strong density gradient across the photoionized slab .",
    "we define the relative pressure difference between the irradiated face and the back of the slab , @xmath29 , as @xmath30 where the denominator represents the isotropic pressure , @xmath31 , of the ambient cloud - confining medium .",
    "note that  is approximately the ratio of dynamical pressure to ambient pressure .",
    "if @xmath32 , the cloud is experiencing a dynamical pressure at the inner irradiated surface ( ` pushed ' clouds by an ambient wind ) , while if @xmath33 the clouds are suffering a drag force at their outer back surface as they are ` pushing ' against the ambient medium .",
    "all the models presented below correspond to this latter case of @xmath34 .    for the dust - free matter bounded slab discussed in paper  i where we neglected inertial and bulk acceleration ( @xmath35 ) , radiative pressure was shown to induce a pressure difference in the slab as high as @xmath36 when = 0.5 .",
    "since any realistic nuclear environment will imply a nonzero @xmath23 as a result of the gravitational field , it is the object of this study to investigate the effect of a positive .    in the general case of @xmath37 , because @xmath38 decreases monotonically with depth as the impinging radiation is gradually absorbed , the right term of equation  ( 2 ) become negative at very large depths .",
    "this can result in @xmath39 depending on the choice of @xmath15 ,  and @xmath26 .",
    "although we could interpret this as being caused by ram pressure of an outflowing ambient medium ( ` pushed ' cloud ) , this domain of parameters has not been explored : first , because the aim of the letter is to relate the line blueshift to the acceleration caused by radiation pressure and not to an extraneous alternative mechanism , second , because all the models considered below are not sufficiently thick to obtain @xmath400 .    to maximize the acceleration ,",
    "it is useful to increase  as much as possible .",
    "however , it was found that = 0.5 which is adopted hereafter can not be exceeded significantly ( otherwise @xmath41 shrinks considerably ) . in effect , = 0.5 maintains two essential effects : it still allows a significant density gradient ( therefore optimizing the line ratio fit , cf .",
    "paper  i ) and it results at the same time in a strong acceleration @xmath23 .",
    "clouds submitted to significant radiation pressure are particularly prone to derimming through the establishment of a lateral flow as shown by mathews ( 1986 ) . for",
    "a review of the problem of cloud stability under conditions appropriate to the nlr , see mathews & veilleux ( 1989 ) .",
    "all detailed studies of the coronal gas reveal that the emitting gas encompasses many stages of excitation .",
    "this indicates that this gas must be significantly thick to the ionizing radiation rather than very optically thin .",
    "we can envisage two geometries , one broadly spherical and filled with low density gas : the onion ring geometry ( korista & ferland 1989 ; osmm ) the other consists of an ensemble of clouds of very low filling factor and therefore similar to the nlr gas in general except for its much higher excitation .",
    "what is clear is that although the range of ionization species of the coronal gas is wide , it does not encompass the very low excitation species of , , ... since the latter appear to be kinematically distinct as shown by osmm and marconi et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) . in paper",
    "i , this was interpreted as an indication that the coronal line emitting clouds were matter bounded as was also thought to be the case for the high excitation clouds of the enlr and nlr @xcite .",
    "the thickness of the clouds is not defined arbitrarily but can be empirically set by the ratio between the highest and the lowest excitation species belonging to the coronal gas . in paper",
    "i it was found that the lines of  and  worked very well for this purpose .",
    "the same procedure is adopted here whereby the slab is truncated at the point where the modeled /  ratio matches the observed value .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the _ dust - free _ case , despite the difference in excitation between the two seyferts , this truncation always seems to occur after @xmath4265% of the ionizing photons have been _",
    "absorbed_.    1 .   the circinus galaxy . [ circ ]",
    "+ if we repeat the dust - free calculations of paper  i with = 0.5 and density = 1200  but set = 0.5 , we find that the modified acceleration is only @xmath43  ( i.e.  is twice that value ) .",
    "as shown later in section  [ mass ] , this is at least an order of magnitude below the acceleration due to the gravity exerted by the stars within 100pc of the nucleus of the milky  way .",
    "it would therefore appear that radiation pressure is insufficient in accelerating radially the line emitting gas .",
    "however , if we allow trace quantities of dust to be present in the cloud , radiation pressure is much higher and dust absorption even dominates the photoelectric absorption terms contained in .",
    "for instance , if we set = 0.1 , we obtain @xmath44 .",
    "the modeling of the observed line ratios reported by mo96 and osmm is presented in fig .",
    "1a ( model  a ) using = 0.1 .",
    "the fit is of comparable quality to that presented in paper  i or in mo96 . as can be expected , the effect of ` uniform return ' depletion on the point is less than 0.05dex ( see section  [ depl ] ) .",
    "the resultant pressure stratification is somewhat smaller at = 1.2 .",
    "it was found that arbitrarily increasing either  or  to higher values degraded significantly the fit to the circinus line ratios .",
    "+ the hypothesis of internal dust is also present in the comprehensive dusty cloud model of pier & voit ( 1995 ) . in their model ,",
    "the strong radiation pressure exerted on the dusty gas ( situated near the inner molecular torus ) leads to progressive cloud evaporation and to the creation of an x - ray - heated wind .",
    "the smaller dust content and cloud s thickness of the matter - bounded clouds presented in this letter leads to a smaller extinction ( @xmath45 ) than in pier & voit ( 1995 ) .",
    "2 .   the seyfert galaxy ngc1068 .",
    "[ ngc ] + we follow a similar procedure in the case of ngc1068 .",
    "the observational data is taken from marconi et  al .",
    "the set of lines is not as complete but is probably sufficient for estimating .",
    "marconi et  al .  reported that the excitation was lower than in circinus .",
    "a similar result is found here .",
    "a value four times lower than in circinus leads to a reasonable fit to the gas _ excitation _ as revealed by the s and si line ratios .",
    "the fit is shown in fig .",
    "1b ( model  b : = 0.125 and = 0.1 ) .",
    "systematic but equal departures from unity ( e.g.  the s lines ) might partly be due to peculiar abundances relative to solar . in this model",
    ", we arbitrarily adopted the same density as for circinus since no published measurements of the density from the  14.3@xmath1m/24.3@xmath1 m  ratio was available at the time of writing .",
    "the excitation indicated by the ratio /  is not so badly fitted but  is certainly discrepant . as was the case for circinus , assigning more than 50% of the radiation pressure to cloud acceleration ( i.e.  @xmath460.5 )",
    "was found to worsen the fit . on the other hand",

    "therefore the modified accelerations  will also scale linearly with  since radiation pressure scales with ionizing flux .",
    "note that a similar model to that of fig .",
    "1b but for which the dust content has been increased to = 0.3 ( i.e. model  c in table  1 ) , the acceleration  becomes comparable to that of model  a with  four times larger ( but three times less dust ) .    for models",

    ", one can determine the density of the coronal line region and therefore .",
    "it is found that the mean density  as defined in paper  i for a pressure stratified slab is the same as that inferred from the calculated far - infrared  line ratio .",
    "therefore this line ratio reveals us the ` characteristic ' density of the highly excited component .",
    "having determined empirically the ionization parameter characterizing the coronal gas in two agn , we can now proceed to compare the calculated  of models with , , the strength of the gravitational field expected in a galactic nucleus .      for radiative acceleration to be responsible of the blueshift of the coronal lines",
    ", it must overcome the gravitational pull of the combined mass of the central stars and the nuclear bh . to illustrate the force entailed ,",
    "let us adopt the better studied milky way mass distribution , @xmath49 , inside a radius @xmath50pc . from 0.1 to 2pc",
    "we borrow the mass model of genzel et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) which we join at 2pc to the isotropic orbit stellar mass model of lindqvist et  al.(1992 ; cf .",

    "is that it might consist of a bh of @xmath52 .",
    "note that beyond @xmath53pc the gravitational pull from the stars dominate that of the bh . on account of the much stronger nuclear activity characterizing seyferts , it is plausible that a typical agn could have a more massive bh than the milkyway .",
    "for instance , estimates of the central mass in ngc1068 ranges from @xmath54 @xcite to @xmath55 @xcite . in an attempt to allow for this possibility",

    "[ facir ] as shown by the horizontal _ solid _ lines , each corresponding to different values of the mean densities . for the particular case of the circinus galaxy for which we know the density",
    ", a minimum radius of 12pc  is inferred inside of which the coronal gas would fall or stall instead of being radially accelerated .",
    "the true position of the nucleus in circinus is not known with precision since its nucleus is heavily reddened and the true kinematic centre may not correspond to the continuum peak .",
    "we can not yet therefore verify the validity of .",
    "however , in the case of ngc1068 , marconi et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) found that the infrared lines were displaced by 0.5  from the optical continuum peak , which corresponds to a nuclear offset of @xmath58pc ( d=18mpc ) .",
    "the gas density is not yet determined but if comparable to circinus , we would expect a much larger  in ngc1068 based on its lower excitation by a factor four .",
    "the main conclusions are the following .",
    "provided there is dust left out in the gas , radiation pressure not only can induce a density gradient in the photoionized clouds but also be responsible for their outward acceleration despite the presence of strong gravitational field .",
    "it is found that higher values than = 0.1 are detrimental to the fit in the case of circinus . based on empirically measured densities and excitation ,",
    "a minimum nuclear distance  is predicted to characterize the _",
    "observable _ coronal gas .",
    "the higher the density , the smaller .",
    "the advent of high spatial resolution line mapping will allow testing whether such a correspondence between @xmath16 and  exists .",
    "finally , because of the large value of , the fraction of ionizing photons escaping the clouds can be quite small even with small amounts of dust . by empirically setting the thickness of the clouds to be such that the observed /  ratio is reproduced by the model",
    ", one finds that only 6% of the impinging photons in model  a are _ not _ absorbed ( instead of 3540% in the dust - free case ) .",
    "one may therefore conceive the possibility that the coronal clouds are not matter bounded but marginally thick and bounded by dust absorption .",
    "the most inner nuclear regions ( presumably of higher visibility in seyferts  1 ) which still emit coronal lines may correspond to the missing domain between the blr and the nlr ( this gas would have to be proportionally denser to have @xmath59 ) . in effect , as shown by netzer & laor ( 1993 ) , dust embedded photoionized gas of high excitation presents a greatly reduced line efficiency explaining the relative line weakness of this putative intermediate region .",
