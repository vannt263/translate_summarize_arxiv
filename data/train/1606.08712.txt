    "the latest experimental techniques of high order harmonic generations can generate coherent light sources in soft x - ray range @xcite , and opened up the new realm of the research area so - called high - frequency regime . here",
    "the terminology `` high - frequency '' means that a photon energy is high enough to ionize a ground state electron by single photon absorption .",
    "meanwhile , high - frequency regime has been intensively studied in theory more than three decades in terms of the high - frequency floquet theory ( hfft ) for monochromatic laser fields developed by gavrila and kaminski @xcite .",
    "the hfft is developed in the kramers - henneberger ( kh ) frame @xcite . in the kh frame ,",
    "an effect of the laser field is described by an atomic potential quivering along a classical trajectory of a free electron in the laser fields .",
    "this is called the kh potential . in high - frequency limit , where the single optical cycle of the laser field is much shorter than the electron s time scale , it was shown that all the fourier components of the kh potential can be ignored except the zeroth component i.e. a time average of the kh potential @xcite .",
    "this is often called the dressed potential .",
    "all the other photon absorption / emission channels then can be treated perturbatively for bound states of the dressed potential even these amplitudes are comparable with the dressed potential .",
    "after the foundation of the hfft , a lot of literatures have been involved to study ionization dynamics in high - frequency regime .",
    "one of the most striking physical phenomenon in high - frequency regime is the stabilization , which an ionization rate begins to decrease for an intensity higher than a certain critical value , first found by pont and gavrila @xcite .",
    "a great number of literatures had been devoted to understand this counter - intuitive phenomenon .",
    "you et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the stabilization stems from a _ spatial _ interference of photo electron wave packets launched at two turning points of the classical electron in laser fields .",
    "for small values of its quiver amplitude , the interference is constructive because they are produced almost the same positions in space .",
    "however , this picture turns into destructive for a quiver amplitude larger than a certain critical value .",
    "this is the origin of the stabilization .",
    "the hfft has given us interesting physical insights in high - frequency regime , but it can only be applied for monochromatic laser fields i.e. _ infinite _ pulse duration .",
    "however , laser pulses of attosecond time scale has become available in the latest experiments as mentioned above .",
    "these unprecedented laser pulses will be employed to study light - matter interactions in extremely short time scale in high - frequency regime , where effects of a time - varying envelope function of a pulse is expected to play important roles .",
    "therefore , it is highly desirable to develop theoretical methods in high - frequency regime to adequately treat _ finite _ pulse duration beyond the hfft .    under such circumstances , we developed the envelope hamiltonian to treat photo ionization dynamics in high - frequency regime in our previous work @xcite .",
    "photo electron amplitudes were analytically derived in the framework of the adiabatic approximation based on the envelope hamiltonian .",
    "the procedures follows the hfft i.e. we realize a dressed potential and treat photon absorption / emission channels perturbatively but the time - dependency of a pulse envelope is explicitly remained .",
    "thus we also obtain the photo electron amplitudes for a non - adiabatic transition induced by the time - dependent envelope function which does not show up in the original hfft .",
    "the capability of the envelope hamiltonian and the adiabatic approximation were demonstrated in @xcite utilizing a simple model in one dimension in the stabilization regime .",
    "it was shown that the results obtained by the full time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) calculations were accurately reconstructed by the tdse for the envelope hamiltonian .    in this paper",
    ", we further explore ionization dynamics in high - frequency regime working on two subjects utilizing the envelope hamiltonian .",
    "first , we revisit the oscillating substructure in photon absorption peaks in high - frequency regime , which has been recently studied by several groups @xcite . in @xcite , they found the oscillating structure in the stabilization regime , and reconstructed it taking into account a _ spatial _ and _ temporal _ interference of photo electron wave packets . in the stabilization regime ,",
    "ionization probability as a function of time has two peaks before and after a peak intensity due to the _ spatial _ interference of photo electron wave packets .",
    "this means that a photo electron wave packet of a certain energy is created in a rising and falling part of a pulse , and they provoke the _ temporal _ interference whose phase difference is given by different moments of their birth in time .",
    "however , their formulas were obtained in an empirical way incorporating a quasi static picture into the hfft . on the other hand , in @xcite",
    ", they only addressed the _ temporal _ interference although their theoretical approach was based on the first principle .",
    "we consider that they did not need to take into account the _ spatial _ interference because their maximum quiver amplitude of a free electron in their pulse was below a threshold for the emergence of the stabilization . in this paper , to our knowledge , we find out for the first time both the signature of the _ spatial _ and _ temporal _ interference in the formula obtained from the first principle .",
    "the second subject in this paper is to extract an optimal pulse duration to maximize a yield of the non - adiabatic transition .",
    "it is found that the yield as a function of a pulse duration has a maximum at a certain pulse duration in our previous work @xcite .",
    "we find out a formula to predict the peak position , and show that the yield becomes maximum when the pulse duration is close to a time scale of an electron .",
    "as far as we know , these two subjects have not been explored yet in high - frequency regime due to the lack of appropriate theoretical frameworks which can take into account time - varying envelope functions .",
    "so , we strongly believe that these are worth to gain further insights for ionization dynamics in high - frequency regime .",
