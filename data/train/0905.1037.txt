    "flocking is a collective behavior of a large group of mobile agents .",
    "typical flocking phenomena include flocks of birds , schools of fish , herds of animals and colonies of bacteria . in nature",
    ", animals achieve flocking for various reasons .",
    "for example , in order to keep safety in numbers and also to confuse predators , they will form flocks for protection .",
    "an agent is more likely to be attacked if it strays away from the flocking group .    as a common demonstration of emergence and emergent behavior , flocking was first simulated on a computer by craig reynolds @xcite . in 1987 , he started with a boid model to build a simulated flock and introduced three rules to simulate flocking :    * collision avoidance : steer to avoid collision with nearby flockmates ( short range repulsion ) .",
    "* velocity matching : steer to match velocity with nearby flockmates .",
    "* flock centering : steer to stay close to nearby flockmates ( long range attraction ) .",
    "the mechanism , known as  separation \" ,  alignment \" and  cohesion \" , results in all agents moving in a formation with the same heading and a fixed network structure . from then on",
    ", these three rules have been widely used to study flocking behavior .    as a special case of reynolds model , in @xcite , vicsek _ et al . _ presented a simulation model based on nearest neighborhood law , in which each agent s heading is updated by the average of the headings of its nearest neighbors and itself .",
    "it was shown that the headings of all the group agents converge to a common value .",
    "a lot of works have been published based on reynolds and vicsek s models in recent years @xcite-@xcite .",
    "to thoroughly and systematically investigate flocking behavior , artificial potential functions ( apfs ) are widely used . in @xcite ,",
    "et al . _ presented an apf in a network with fixed topology which is a differential , nonnegative and radially unbounded function of the distance between two agents .",
    "then , he modified the apf to a nonsmooth one in a network with switching topology which captures the fact that there is no agent interaction beyond a proper distance @xcite . later , olfati - saber modified tanner s apf and defined another apf which is a bounded and smooth one for switching topology .    in view of the pitfall of regular fragmentation @xcite , which is a phenomenon of flocking failure most likely occurring for generic set of initial states and large number of agents , olfati - saber also introduced a flocking mechanism based on a virtual leader @xcite .",
    "even though the initial states is selected randomly , the mechanism can guarantee a flocking behavior .",
    "however , this method assumes that all the agents know information about the virtual leader . in consideration of practical use ,",
    "shi _ et al .",
    "_ and su _ et al .",
    "_ showed that flocking appears even when only some agents are informed @xcite-@xcite , these we call pseudo - leaders in this paper .",
    "_ et al . _ and su _ et al .",
    "_ showed that flocking could appear when not all the agents are informed in a group , precisely which agents should be informed has not yet been considered . in this paper , we focus on investigating which agents should be selected as pseudo - leaders for flocking in a weighted network .",
    "another difference from previous work is that , in the absence of control , the acceleration of each agent is dynamic .",
    "this can be seen in our system model in section ii .",
    "that is , if there are no attractive / repulsive control , no information exchange with others and no information received from the virtual leader for an agent , its acceleration is dynamic instead of constant , as is the case in previous work . by using lyapunov stability theory ,",
    "a simple criterion for choosing pseudo - leaders is proposed .",
    "the reminder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , model depiction , preliminaries about graph theory , and mathematical analysis are briefly introduced . in section iii",
    ", the main results are proposed .",
    "we investigate how to select pseudo - leaders for flocking in a multi - agent dynamical group with fixed topology .",
    "section iv gives some extensions and discussion of the main results so that one can gain useful insight into the problem of choosing pseudo - leaders .",
    "two computational examples in small - sized and large - scale groups are simulated to illustrate effectiveness of the proposed approach in section v. we summarize the main ideas and conclusions in section vi .",
    "to make this paper self - contained , some basics of graph theory are recalled @xcite .    a _ graph _ @xmath0 is a pair of sets @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a finite non - empty set of elements called _ vertices _ , and @xmath3 is a set of unordered pairs of distinct vertices called _",
