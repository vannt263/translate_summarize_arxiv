    "a state which does not have any classical analogue is known as nonclassical state . for example , squeezed state and antibunched state are nonclassical . of a quantum state",
    "is a measure of the total fluctuations of the amplitude particular parameters , which are essentially combination of standard deviations of some function of quantum phase , were introduced by carruthers and nieto [ [ carutherrs ] ] as a measure of quantum phase fluctuations . in recent past people",
    "have used carruthers nieto parameters to study quantum phase fluctuations of coherent light interacting with a nonlinear nonabsorbing medium of inversion symmetry [ [ gerry]-[enu : pathak ] ] .",
    "but unfortunately any discussion regarding the physical meaning of these parameters were missing since recent past .",
    "recently we have shown that the reduction of the carruthers - nieto symmetric quantum phase fluctuation parameter @xmath0 with respect to its poissonian state value corresponds to an antibunched state , but the converse is not true [ [ the : phase - prakash ] ] .",
    "consequently reduction of @xmath1 is a stronger criterion of nonclassicality than the lower order antibunching .",
    "the intermediate states are nonclassical in general .",
    "it has also been observed that almost all the intermediate states satisfy the condition of higher order antibunching [ [ a - verma ] ] . as the condition of higher",
    "order antibunching is stronger than that of usual antibunching in the sense that a state which is antibunched in the @xmath2 order has to be antibunched in @xmath3 order too but the converse is not true [ [ enu : garcia ] ] .",
    "therefore , it seems quite reasonable to check whether the intermediate states satisfy the stronger condition of reduction of @xmath1 or not .",
    "present study reveals that the intermediate states may satisfy this stronger nonclassical criterion ( i.e. reduction of @xmath1 criterion ) .    the introduction of hermitian phase operators have some ambiguities ( interested readers can see the review [ [ lynch2 ] ] ) which lead to many different formalisms [ [ enu : l .- suskind - and]-[enu : bp ] and references there in ] of quantum phase . among the different formalisms , susskind glogower ( sg ) [ [ enu : l .- suskind - and ] ] , pegg barnett [ [ enu : d .-",
    "pegg ] ] and barnett pegg ( bp ) [ [ enu : bp ] ] formalisms played most important role in the studies of phase properties and the phase fluctuations of various physical systems .",
    "for example , sg formalism has been used by fan [ [ fan ] ] , sanders [ [ sander ] ] , yao [ [ yao ] ] , gerry [ [ gerry ] ] , carruthers and nieto [ [ carutherrs ] ] and many others to study the phase properties and phase fluctuations . on the other hand lynch [ [ lynch],[lynch1 ] ] ,",
    "vacaro [ [ vacaro ] ] , tsui [ [ y .- k .- tsui , ] ] , pathak and mandal [ [ enu : pathak ] ] and others have used the bp formalism for the same purpose . the physical interpretation of reduction of @xmath1 is valid in both sg and bp formalism of quantum phase [ [ the : phase - prakash ] ] .",
    "here we have studied the possibilities of observing reduction of @xmath1 with respect to its poissonian state value ( for intermediate state ) in bp formalism .",
    "the importance of a systematic study of quantum phase fluctuation of intermediate state has also increased with the recent observations of quantum phase fluctuations in quantum computation [ [ qutrit ] , [ l .- l .- sanchez - soto ] ] and superconductivity [ [ y .- k .- tsui , ] , [ nature , supercond ] ] and with the success in experimental production of photon added coherent state [ [ the : photonadded - experiment ] ] . these observations along with the fact that intermediate states satisfy stronger criterion of nonclassicality ( namely the criterion of hoa ) have motivated us to study quantum phase fluctuation of intermediate states . in next section",
    "we briefly introduce quantum phase fluctuation parameter ( @xmath1 ) and the meaning of reduction of @xmath1 . in section 3",
    ", it is shown that the reduction of phase fluctuation parameter @xmath1 can be seen in different intermediate state , such as binomial state , hypergeometric state , generalized binomial state , negative binomial state and photon added coherent state .",
    "role of various parameters in controlling the depth of nonclassicality is also discussed . finally in section 4",
    "we conclude .",
    "dirac [ [ enu : dirac ] ] introduced the quantum phase operator in 1926 . immediately after dirac s introductory work it was realized that the uncertainty relation @xmath4 associated with dirac s quantum phase has many problems [ [ lynch2 ] ] .",
    "later on louisell [ [ enu : w .- h .- louisell , ] ] had shown that most of the problems can be solved if instead of bare phase operator we consider sine @xmath5 and cosine @xmath6 operators which satisfy @xmath7=-is\\end{array}\\label{eq : phase5.1}\\ ] ] and @xmath8=ic.\\label{eq : phase5.2}\\ ] ] therefore , the uncertainty relations associated with them are @xmath9 and @xmath10 there are several formalism of quantum phase , and each formalism defines sine and cosine in an unique way .",
    "the sine and cosine operators in susskind glogower formalism is essentially originated due to a rescaling of the photon annihilation and creation operators with the photon number operator .",
    "another convenient way is to rescale an appropriate quadrature operator with the averaged photon number .",
    "barnett and pegg followed this convention and defined the exponential of phase operator @xmath11 and its hermitian conjugate @xmath12 as [ [ enu : bp ] ] @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the average number of photons present in the radiation field after interaction .",
    "the usual cosine and sine of the phase operator are defined as @xmath15 which satisfy @xmath16 squaring and adding ( [ eq : phase5.3 ] ) and ( [ eq : phase5.4 ] ) we obtain @xmath17\\left/\\left[<s>^{2}+<c>^{2}\\right]\\right.\\geq\\frac{1}{4}.\\label{eq : babu}\\ ] ] carruthers and nieto [ [ carutherrs ] ] introduced ( [ eq : babu ] ) as measure of quantum phase fluctuation and named it as @xmath1 parameter . to be precise , carruthers and nieto defined following parameter as a measure of phase fluctuation and @xmath18 for the purpose of calculation of the phase fluctuations .",
    "but these parameters are not relevant for the present work . ] : @xmath19\\left/\\left[\\langle s\\rangle^{2}+\\langle c\\rangle^{2}\\right]\\right.\\label{kuri}\\ ] ] where , @xmath20 is the phase of the input coherent state @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the interaction time and @xmath23 is the mean number of photon prior to the interaction . later on this parameter draw more attention and many groups [ [ gerry]-[enu : pathak ] ] have used these parameters as a measure of quantum phase fluctuation .",
    "the total noise of a quantum state is a measure of the total fluctuations of the amplitude . for a single mode quantum state having density matrix @xmath24",
    "it is defined as [ [ the : orlowski]]@xmath25 in analogy to it we can define the total phase fluctuation as @xmath26 now using the relations ( [ eq : phase5.3 ] ) , ( [ eq : phase5.4 ] ) , ( [ eq : bp2 ] ) , ( [ eq : babu ] ) and ( [ eq : totalnoise - phase ] ) we obtain @xmath27 or , @xmath28 or , @xmath29 and@xmath30=\\frac{i}{2}\\left(\\overline{n}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}.\\label{eq : bp3}\\ ] ] therefore , @xmath31 now we can write,@xmath32 the function @xmath33 has a clear minima at @xmath34 , which corresponds to a coherent state and thus the total fluctuation in quantum phase variables @xmath35 can not be reduced below its coherent state value @xmath36 .",
    "now since @xmath37 is positive and the @xmath38 , therefore @xmath39 is positive . under these conditions",
    "@xmath40 increases monotonically with the increase in @xmath41 .",
    "thus the minima of @xmath41 corresponds to the minima of @xmath40 too and consequently , @xmath40 is minimum for coherent state . in other words",
    "@xmath40 can not be reduced below its coherent state value .",
    "therefore any reduction in @xmath42 with respect to its poissonian state value will mean a decrease in @xmath37 with respect to its poissonian state counter part .",
    "thus the reduction of @xmath1 with respect to its poissonian state value implies antibunching but the converse is not true .",
    "earlier we have reported reduction of @xmath1 with respect to coherent state in some simple optical processes and verified that the states are antibunched for the corresponding parameters .",
    "but the fact that every antibunched state is not associated with the reduction of @xmath1 was not verified in the earlier work . here",
    "we have shown that reduction of @xmath1 is possible for various intermediate states and have also provided examples of intermediate states , which are antibunched for specific values of parameters but do not show reduction of @xmath1 for the same values of the parameters .",
    "the intermediate states are studied under bp formalism because of the inherent computational simplicity of these formalism over the others .",
    "as the value of @xmath1 in coherent ( poissonian ) state is @xmath43 our requirement of strong nonclassicality reduces to @xmath44 further simplification of the criterion ( [ eq : du1 ] ) is possible in bp formalism since the symmetric phase fluctuation parameter in bp formalism reduces to @xmath45[\\frac{<a^{\\mathit{\\dagger}}a>-<a^{\\dagger}><a>+\\frac{1}{2}}{<a^{\\dagger}><a>}]$ ] and consequently our requirement for strong nonclassicality is @xmath46[\\frac{<a^{\\mathit{\\dagger}}a>-<a^{\\dagger}><a>+\\frac{1}{2}}{<a^{\\dagger}><a>}]-\\frac{1}{2}<0.\\label{eq : du2}\\ ] ] now in light of this criterion we would like to study the nonclassical behavior of intermediate states .",
    "actually , an intermediate state is a quantum state which reduces to two or more distinguishably different states ( normally , distinguishable in terms of photon number distribution ) in different limits . in 1985 ,",
    "such a state was first time introduced by stoler _",
    "[ [ stoler ] ] . to be precise , they introduced binomial state ( bs ) as a state which is intermediate between the most nonclassical number state @xmath47 and the most classical coherent state @xmath21 .",
    "they defined bs as @xmath48 this stateis simply a binomial distribution . ]",
    "is called intermediate state as it reduces to number state in the limit @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( as @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) and in the limit of @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a real constant , it reduces to a coherent state with real amplitude . since the introduction of bs as an intermediate state it was always been of interest to quantum optics , nonlinear optics , atomic physics and molecular physics community",
    "consequently , different properties of binomial state have been studied [ [ the : hong - chenfu - genralized - bs]-[the : oebs ] ] . in these studies",
    "it has been observed that the nonclassical phenomena ( such as , antibunching , squeezing and higher order squeezing ) can be seen in bs .",
    "this trend of search for nonclassicality in binomial state , continued in nineties and in one hand , several version of generalized bs has been proposed [ [ the : hong - chenfu - genralized - bs]-[the : hong - yi - fan - generalized - bs ] ] and in the other hand people went beyond binomial states and proposed several other form of intermediate states ( such as the studies in the nineties were mainly limited to theoretical predictions but the recent developments in the experimental techniques made it possible to verify some of those theoretical predictions .",
    "for example , we can note that , as early as in 1991 agarwal and tara [ [ the : agarwal - photonadded ] ] introduced photon added coherent state as @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 is an integer and @xmath21 is coherent state ) but the experimental generation of the state has happened only in recent past when zavatta , viciani and bellini [ [ the : photonadded - experiment ] ] succeed to produce it in 2004 .",
    "it is easy to observe that this is an intermediate state , since it reduces to coherent state in the limit @xmath57 and to number state in the limit @xmath58 .",
    "it is also been found that most of these intermediate states show antibunching , squeezing , higher order squeezing , subpoissonian photon statistics etc .",
    "inspired by these observations , many schemes to generate intermediate states have been proposed in recent past [ [ the : photonadded - experiment],[the : valverde],[the : rlofranco1 ] ] . thus the intermediate states provide a perfect test bed to test the satisfiability of any new criterion of nonclassicality . keeping this in mind we will investigate the possibility of satisfication of ( [ eq : du2 ] ) for different intermediate states in the following subsections .",
    "binomial state is originally defined as ( [ eq : binomial1 ] ) , from which it is straight forward to show that @xmath59^{\\frac{1}{2}}|p , m-1\\rangle.\\end{array}\\label{eq : eigen1}\\ ] ] similarly , we can write , @xmath60^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\label{eq : bino1}\\ ] ] consequently , we obtain ,    @xmath61    @xmath62    and @xmath63 now using equations ( [ eq : du2 ] ) and ( [ eq : eigen1]-[eq : bino4 ] ) one can obtain ,    @xmath64-\\frac{1}{2}]\\end{array}\\label{eq : du - binomial}\\ ] ]    [ h ]    from the fig .",
    "1 , it is clear that the binomial state shows reduction of fluctuation of quantum phase with respect to its coherent state counter part and thus it satisfies this stronger criterion of nonclassicality .",
    "but it does not satisfy the criterion for higher values of @xmath65 . in [ [ a - verma ] ]",
    "we have shown that binomial state is always antibunched up to any order .",
    "for higher values of @xmath65 it is antibunched in every order and thus satisfies the other strong criterion of nonclassicality but do not satisfy the criterion laid down on the basis of quantum phase fluctuations .",
    "earlier we had reported [ [ the : phase - prakash ] ] that reduction of quantum phase fluctuation means antibunching but the converse is not true .",
    "this is the first time when an example of such a state which is antibunched but reduction of quantum phase fluctuation with respect to coherent state does not happen , is found .",
    "[ h ]    from fig .",
    "2 it is clear that the reduction of quantum phase fluctuation happens for roy and roy generalized binomial state .",
    "it is also observed that the depth of nonclassicality reduces with the increase in @xmath54 and @xmath76 .",
    "but as far as the higher ( second ) order antibunching is concerned , the depth of nonclassicality associated with it decreases with increase in @xmath54 and increases with increase in @xmath76 ( see fig . 2 and 3 of [ [ a - verma ] ] ) . farther it had been observed in [ [ a - verma ] ] that for particular values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 the state does not show second order antibunching .",
    "but here it is found that for the same values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 we can obtain reduction of quantum phase fluctuation parameter with respect to its coherent state counterpart .",
    "consequently we can say that , reduction of quantum phase fluctuation means antibunching but does not essentially mean higher order antibunching and therefore , it is not essential that these two stronger conditions of nonclassicality would appear simultaneously .",
    "photon added coherent state ( pacs ) is defined as [ [ the : agarwal - photonadded ] ] ) @xmath79^{1/2}}\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\alpha^{n}\\sqrt{(n+m)!}}{n!}|n+m>\\end{array}\\label{eq : pacs1}\\ ] ] where @xmath80@xmath81is lauguere polynomial .",
    "rigorous operator algebra yields @xmath82 @xmath83 and @xmath84 by substituting equations ( [ eq : pacs2]-[eq : pacs4 ] ) in ( [ eq : du2 ] ) we can easily obtain a long expression of @xmath85 .",
    "essential characteristic of @xmath85 of pacs can be seen in fig 3 .",
    "it is easy to observe that the reduction of quantum phase fluctuation is possible in photon added coherent state . since the depth of nonclassicality increases with the increase in @xmath56 .",
    "so we can conclude , the more photon are added to coherent state the more nonclassical it is as far as the depth of nonclassicality associated with quantum phase fluctuation is concerned .",
    "this particular characteristic is also been reflected in higher order antibunching [ [ a - verma ] ] .",
    "[ h ]      as it is mentioned in the earlier sections , there exist several different intermediate states . for the systematic study of possibility of reduction of quantum phase fluctuation in intermediate states",
    ", we have studied all the well known intermediate states .",
    "since the procedure followed for the study of different states is similar , mathematical detail has not been shown in the subsections below . but",
    "from the expression of @xmath85 and the corresponding plots it would be easy to see that the reduction of quantum phase fluctuation can be observed in all the intermediate states studied below .",

    "4 and it has been observed that the state is more nonclassical for lower values of @xmath65 and higher values of @xmath88 [ [ a - verma ] ] .",
    "this is consistent with the earlier observations on higher order antibunching of nbs .",
    "[ h ]      hyper geometric state ( hs ) is defined as [ [ the : hypergeomtric ] ] @xmath89 where , @xmath90^{1/2}\\left(\\begin{array}{c } l\\\\ m\\end{array}\\right)^{-1/2}$ ] . for this intermediate state",
    "we obtain @xmath91.\\end{array}\\label{eq : du - hs}\\ ] ]    [ h ]    fig .",
    "5 depicts the characteristics of quantum phase fluctuation of hs . from this figure",
    "we can clearly observe that hs does not satisfy the reduction of quantum phase fluctuation criterion for higher values of @xmath65 but it satisfies the condition of higher order antibunching and consequently the condition of antibunching for those values of @xmath92 this is consistent with our theoretical prediction that reduction of quantum phase fluctuation means antibunching but the converse is not true .",
    "in essence , all the intermediate states described above that the binomial state can show reduction of fluctuation of quantum phase with respect to its coherent state counter part and thus it can satisfy this stronger criterion of nonclassicality .",
    "but it does not satisfy the criterion for higher values of @xmath65 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in [ [ a - verma ] ]",
    "we have shown that binomial state is always antibunched up to any order .",
    "thus for higher values of @xmath65 it is higher order antibunched and consequently satisfies the other strong criterion of nonclassicality but do not satisfy the criterion laid down on the basis of quantum phase fluctuations .",
    "similar phenomenon is also observed in hs .",
    "earlier we had reported [ [ the : phase - prakash ] ] that reduction of quantum phase fluctuation means antibunching but the converse is not true .",
    "this is the first time when an example of such a state which is antibunched but does not show reduction of quantum phase fluctuation with respect to coherent state , is found .",
    "further from the study of phase properties of roy roy gbs and hs we have learnt that the reduction of quantum phase fluctuation mean antibunching but does not essentially mean higher order antibunching and therefore , it is not essential that these two stronger conditions of nonclassicality appear simultaneously . in connection to pacs",
    "we have observed that the more photon are added to coherent state the more nonclassical the pacs , is as far as the depth of nonclassicality associated with quantum phase fluctuation is concerned .",
    "this particular characteristic has also been reflected in higher order antibunching [ [ a - verma ] ] .",
    "further we have seen that the nbs is more nonclassical for lower values of @xmath65 .",
