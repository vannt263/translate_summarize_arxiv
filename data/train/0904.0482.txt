    "one of the most fascinating phenomena due to strong correlated electrons is the kondo effect @xcite . observed originally in the context of magnetic impurities diluted in bulk alloys , the kondo physics results in the enhancement of the material resistance for temperatures @xmath0 below the characteristic kondo temperature @xmath1 . in the 90 s , with the development of miniaturization techniques , systems of quantum dots ( qds ) coupled to a left and to a right electron reservoir ( e.g. metallic electrodes ) became quite feasible @xcite . in this new context of qds attached to electrodes ,",
    "the kondo effect results in a wealth of novel features @xcite .",
    "probably , the appearance in the dot density of states of a narrow peak ( width given by @xmath2 ) at the fermi level of the reservoirs is one of the most remarkable feature .",
    "this peak gives rise to an enhancement of the conductance , thus significantly improving the charge transport in the system .",
    "in particular , in the presence of an external bias voltage applied in a left and a right electrode ( non - equilibrium regime ) , two kondo peaks appear pinned at the fermi levels of the leads @xcite .",
    "when the electrodes are ferromagnetic ( fm ) , additional spin - dependent effects emerge .",
    "for instance , due to a large local exchange field on the qd , the kondo resonance splits into two peaks , where the energy separation can be tuned via the magnetization alignment of the electrodes , their polarizations and a possible external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "nowadays , systems of a single qd coupled to leads are routinely developed in the laboratories and the observation of the kondo resonance is frequent , including the measurement of the kondo peak splitting @xcite .",
    "an alternative system is composed of a metallic host surface with an adatom ( adsorbed atom ) and a fm tip @xcite .",
    "contrastingly to the well studied lead - qd - lead geometry , the present system ( tip - adatom - host ) presents a more wealth physics in the sense that quantum interference between distinct tunneling paths emerges .",
    "the two possible interfering ways are the direct tunneling tip - host and the indirect one , tip - adatom - host .",
    "in particular , below @xmath1 the kondo resonance at the adatom spectral function provides the tunneling channel through the adatom .",
    "the quantum interference mechanism results in an asymmetric line shape of the kondo resonance , that instead of looks like a lorentzian it becomes similar to a characteristic fano resonance @xcite .",
    "this fano - kondo resonance has been widely measured in experiments with nonmagnetic tips @xcite and also discussed in theoretical works @xcite .",
    "the development of fm tips @xcite makes the system tip - adatom - host a potential candidate to future implementation of spintronic devices @xcite .",
    "recently , patton _",
    "@xcite studied theoretically the effects of the tip ferromagnetism on the conductance in the kondo regime .",
    "it was found a splitting of the fano line shape of the conductance . additionally , for fm tips it was investigated the effects of the lateral tip - adatom separation on the conductance in the full range of the fano parameter , i.e. , the rate between the tip - adatom and the tip - host coupling strengths @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we calculate the spin - resolved conductance for the system fm tip - adatom - host in the linear regime of tunneling .",
    "the kondo resonant peak is modeled via the doniach - sunjic spectral function @xcite .",
    "we predict a powerful generation of spin polarized currents even for tips with a tiny magnetization .",
    "the current can be full up or down polarized , depending on the external bias .",
    "this effect comes from the spin splitting of the fano - kondo resonance , that strongly suppresses one spin component of the conductance in a particular bias range .",
    "the effects of the lateral tip - adatom distance of this _ spin - polarizer device _ are also investigated .",
    "we start from the model hamiltonian    @xmath3    where the terms represent the host metal with the magnetic impurity @xmath4 , the fm tip @xmath5 and the coupling between them @xmath6 . for the description of a magnetic impurity coupled to a host metal",
    ", we use the single impurity anderson model ( siam ) @xcite    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the destruction operator for a conduction electron with momentum @xmath9 and spin @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the destruction operator for an electron localized at the adatom site . the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the energy of the adatom level and the coulomb repulsion between two electrons with opposite spins at the adatom , respectively .",
    "for a sake of simplicity , we consider the case of a conduction band with a flat density of states @xmath14 and half - width denoted by @xmath15 in order to describe the hybridization of this band with the adatom , we introduce a normalized fermionic operator @xmath16 as follows    @xmath17    where @xmath18 denotes the total number of the conduction states .",
    "as we are focusing on the kondo regime , we consider only the range of system parameters favoring the formation of a localized magnetic moment at the adatom , namely @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 . for temperatures @xmath22",
    "this magnetic moment becomes screened by the host conduction electrons , due to the antiferromagnetic correlations and the kondo peak with half - width @xmath2 and centered at the fermi energy , appears in the adatom spectral density . here",
    "we use the same estimate for the kondo temperature as in @xcite , @xmath23.\\label{eq : kondo_tk}\\ ] ]    in this work the electron - electron interactions inside the fm tip are neglected and thus    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the destruction operator for a tip conduction electron and @xmath26 is the tip bias voltage .",
    "as we consider the case of a ferromagnetic tip , the corresponding density of states becomes spin - dependent and is described by    @xmath27    with @xmath28 denoting the spin orientations , @xmath29 being the tip magnetization .",
    "the tunneling hamiltonian couples the tip with the host metal and the adatom , i.e. ,    @xmath30    where the terms @xmath31 and @xmath32 correspond to the tip - host and tip - adatom hopping terms , respectively . following @xcite , we introduce the exponential decay of @xmath33 with increasing of the tip - adatom lateral distance @xmath34 .",
    "the amplitude of the tip - host metal tunneling depends on the value of the conduction band wave function @xmath35 calculated at the tip position .",
    "the derivation of the conductance formula treats the tunneling hamiltonian ( [ eq:5 ] ) as a linear perturbation @xcite .",
    "as we consider @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the kondo regime , we can safely evaluate the conductance formula at @xmath38 which results in    @xmath39\\left[\\frac{\\rho_{0r}^{\\sigma}}{\\rho_{0}}\\right],\\label{eq : conductance}\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 is the background conductance and    @xmath41    is the host metal density of states in the presence of the kondo adatom with the tip . the function    @xmath42    with @xmath43 being the zeroth - order bessel function , accounts for the spatial dependence of the conductance on the lateral tip - adatom distance @xmath44 .",
    "the density in the spectral representation over the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ eq:2 ] ) given by expression    @xmath45    accounts for the quantum interference between the tunneling paths @xmath33 and @xmath46 characterized by the fano factor @xcite    @xmath47    the cases @xmath48 and @xmath49 correspond to the domination of tip - adatom and tip - host metal tunneling , respectively , while the limit @xmath50 corresponds to the case where these two processes are of comparable intensity .",
    "after some algebra ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for relevant details ) , we can write eq.([eq : rho_s2 ] ) as    @xmath51\\right.\\nonumber \\\\   & \\times & \\pi \\gamma\\rho_{ad\\sigma}(ev ) \\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\left.2\\gamma\\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{f}_{k_{f}r}}{\\rho_{0}}\\right)\\tilde{q}_{r}\\re\\left\\ { g_{ad\\sigma}^{ret}(ev)\\right\\ } \\right\\}\\nonumber \\\\    \\label{eq : rho_0_b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath52    is the effective fano factor ,    @xmath53    is the fano factor for the siam in the absence of the tip @xcite and    @xmath54^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\frac{1}{\\pi\\gamma}\\sin^{2}\\delta_{ev}^{\\sigma}\\label{eq : dos_adatom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    is the adatom spectral density determined by the interacting adatom green function @xmath55 written in terms of the doniach - sunjic formula @xcite and the phase shift @xmath56 of the conduction states , respectively .",
    "the kondo peak splitting @xmath57 originates from the ferromagnetic exchange interaction between the tip and the magnetic adatom @xcite , resulting in the lifting of the spin degeneracy for the adatom level @xmath12 .",
    "following the `` poor man s '' scaling method @xcite , this splitting can be estimated as    @xmath58p\\exp\\left(-2k_{f}r\\right)\\label{eq : kondo_splitting}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath59    in the regime @xmath60 one can neglect the contribution of eq.([eq : fano_2 ] ) in eq.([eq : fano_effective ] ) , thus we prefer to express the spin - resolved conductance as    @xmath61\\left[\\frac{\\rho^{\\sigma}(ev)}{\\rho_{0}}\\right],\\label{eq : spin_resolved}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath62    and    @xmath63    which is a function bounded by two in units of @xmath64 using the expressions    @xmath65    and particularizing for @xmath66 eq.([eq : spin_resolved ] ) reduces to the simple form    @xmath67    finally , the spin polarization of the tunneling current is determined as @xmath68",
    "for quantitative analysis of the conductance we choose a following set of system parameters : @xmath69 @xmath70ev , @xmath71ev , @xmath72ev , @xmath73ev , @xmath74k and @xmath75@xmath76 @xcite .",
    "the kondo temperature was estimated using eq.([eq : kondo_tk ] ) .",
    "figure ( [ fig2 ] ) shows the spin polarization @xmath77 as a function of the bias voltage for differing tip magnetization parameter @xmath29 .",
    "the case @xmath78 gives no spin polarization as it is indeed expected for a nonmagnetic lead .",
    "when @xmath79 , @xmath77 reveals two remarkable features : ( i ) it attains a maximum plateau ( @xmath80 ) around @xmath81 , and ( ii ) it shows a narrow dip at some specific negative bias voltage , yielding to @xmath82 .",
    "increasing @xmath29 , it is possible to enlarge the plateau in which @xmath80 , and the dip ( @xmath82 ) moves toward negative biases .",
    "particularly , for @xmath83 ( full polarized tip ) the spin polarization loses its structure , assuming a constant value @xmath84 .",
    "note however , that even for small tip polarizations ( e.g. @xmath85 ) , it is still possible to find @xmath86 , around @xmath81 .",
    "so this system operates as a powerful _ current polarizer _ , even for tips with weak magnetization ( small @xmath29 ) . for relatively high voltages ,",
    "the spin polarization reaches a constant value equal to the tip magnetization parameter @xmath29 .",
    "this system , thus , provides the means to choose the spin polarization from @xmath87 to @xmath88 , by simple tuning a tip s voltage @xmath26 . a variety of systems capable to tune the current polarization such as spin - filters @xcite and the spin - diodes @xcite have emerged in the context of spintronics .",
    "some of them were recently realized experimentally @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to control dynamically the current polarization by using time dependent bias voltages @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the system we consider here is first to use the interplay between kondo effect and quantum interference to control and amplify a current polarization .    figure ( [ fig3 ] ) shows separately the spin - resolved conductances , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "for @xmath78 we find @xmath91 , with kondo resonance having asymmetric fano line shape coming from the interference between the two possible tunnelings paths .",
    "similar fano - kondo profile has been observed in systems with normal metal tips @xcite .",
    "with increasing of @xmath29 , the conductances demonstrates a spin - splitting with @xmath89 moving to the left and @xmath90 to the right , thus generating a _ window _ of completely spin polarized transport ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "this window corresponds to @xmath84 plateau in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) . additionally , the @xmath82 dip in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) comes from the minimum of @xmath89 in the negative voltage range in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) . while @xmath89 increases in amplitude ,",
    "@xmath90 is suppressed .",
    "this happens because @xmath93 is weighted by the tip density of states , which is proportional to @xmath94 ( see eq.([eq : g_r_0 ] ) ) . in the limiting case",
    "@xmath83 only @xmath89 remains .",
    "finally , in figure ( [ fig4 ] ) we show the effects of the lateral tip - adatom separation on the spin polarization @xmath77 . as @xmath34 increases ,",
    "the minimal and maximal values of @xmath77 are reduced , and the whole curve approaches a flat line corresponding to a magnetization of the tip @xmath29 .",
    "this behavior of @xmath77 can be understood from right panels ( b)-(d ) , where spin - resolved conductances @xmath93 are shown .",
    "increasing @xmath34 , the fano - kondo resonances for both @xmath89 and @xmath90 tend to a more symmetric antiresonance and the spin - splitting is quenched .",
    "it is valid to note that similar evolution of the fano - kondo line shape with @xmath34 was experimentally reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for an unpolarized tip .",
    "the overall evolution picture in this experiment consisted of a fano like resonance for @xmath95 , a more symmetric antiresonance for intermediate @xmath34 and an approximately flat profile ( background ) for large enough @xmath34 .",
    "this general picture is also seen for each @xmath93 in the present spin - dependent case .",
    "however , due to the ferromagnetism of the tip , @xmath89 remains above @xmath90 which makes the spin - polarization @xmath77 approach the background polarization @xmath29 .",
    "we have calculated spin - resolved conductances for a system with a ferromagnetic tip coupled to an adatom on a nonmagnetic metallic surface ( host ) .",
    "the conductance line shape is characterized by a fano resonance , which differs for each spin component . in particular , we find a bias range in which @xmath92 while @xmath89 is maximum , due to the fano interference between tunneling paths .",
    "this contrasting features for @xmath89 and @xmath90 develops a plateau in the spin polarization @xmath77 in which the current can be full polarized ( @xmath80 ) . by increasing the tip magnetization parameter @xmath29",
    ", it is possible to enlarge this plateau , thus covering a more broaden bias window .",
    "a full down polarized current ( @xmath82 ) can also be achieved by simple tuning the bias voltage .",
    "this system thus operates as a powerful source of polarized current , with its polarization being dependent on the biases .",
