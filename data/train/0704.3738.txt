    "in order to describe inhomogeneous systems in equilibrium , one could assume , that this can be done by the usual thermodynamic variables , which depend on the spatial coordinates .",
    "all standard thermodynamic relations are then assumed to remain valid .",
    "as van der waals has shown for one - component system @xcite , however , this is not enough to describe the surface .",
    "it is necessary to assume that thermodynamic potentials , particularly the helmholtz energy density , also depends on spatial derivatives of the density .",
    "cahn & hilliard have shown for a binary mixture @xcite , that the helmholtz energy should depend on the gradients of the mole fraction of one of the components . for a multi - component",

    "dependence of the specific helmholtz energy on the density gradients can be represented by taylor series in these gradients .",
    "we describe here isotropic fluids , so any coefficient in this taylor series can not depend on any direction and thus should be scalar .",
    "the zeroth term , taken when all the gradients are equal to zero , is the homogeneous helmholtz energy @xmath9 . in equilibrium ,",
    "the total helmholtz energy of the system has a minimum .",
    "thus , the first order term , with the first order density gradients , @xmath10 , is zero .",
    "the second order term is quadratic in the first order density gradients @xmath11 , and is linear in the second order density gradients @xmath12 .",
    "the latter one , however , contributes to the total helmholtz energy the same way as the former one : @xmath13 the first term on the right hand side of this equation can be combined with the quadratic term in the first order gradients .",
    "the second one can be chosen equal to zero by proper choice of the boundaries of integration .",

    "it follows from eq .   that a constant tensor can be added to @xmath46 without affecting the validity of this equation . in a homogeneous limit",
    "this tensor does not vanish , so it should be present in the homogeneous tensor @xmath74 , which is proportional to the homogeneous pressure @xmath75 .",
    "the homogeneous pressure @xmath75 , however , is determined unambiguously by the specified equations of state .",
    "it follows then that this constant tensor have to be equal to zero and @xmath46 is given by eq .   unambiguously .    using that @xmath37 and @xmath36 are the chemical potentials and eq .",

    "one can also conclude , that the quantity , determined by eq .",

    "in this paper we have established the framework of the gradient model for the liquid - vapor ( or , alternatively , liquid - liquid ) interface in an isotropic non - polarizable mixture .",
    "it is necessary that the homogeneous helmholtz energy @xmath1 allows solutions which imply equilibrium coexistence between different phases .",
    "otherwise we only have the homogeneous phase .",
    "standard mixture theories @xcite give a helmholtz energy which allows liquid - vapor coexistence .",
    "using the assumption that in the interfacial region the fluid can be described by the local densities and their gradients , we have extended the gradient models , used to describe one - component fluids and binary mixtures , to three - dimensional multi - component mixtures . the condition which the system should satisfy is that the total helmholtz energy is minimal . with the help of lagrange method is was possible to derive the equations , which the profile distribution should satisfy , given the fixed total molar content of the components .",
    "the lagrange multipliers are equal to the chemical potentials of the coexisting liquid and vapor .",
    "it was also possible to determine the pressure behavior in the interfacial region .",
    "it is crucial , that the pressure has a tensorial behavior .",
    "the difference between the tensorial part of the pressure tensor and the scalar part determines the surface tension .",
    "an important observation is the ambiguity in the determination of the local thermodynamic potentials , for instance the specific helmholtz energy .",
    "while the total helmholtz energy is unique and has a minimum , the specific helmholtz energy is not unique .",
    "one can add a term which is the divergence of some vector field , if the normal component of this field vanishes on the system boundaries , without affecting the total helmholtz energy .",
    "this general observation in the context of the gradient model implies that the density gradients are taken equal to zero on the boundary .",
    "it must be emphasized , that for realistic boundaries these gradients are not zero .",
    "we refer to the wall - theorem @xcite in this context .",
    "we take the freedom to set them equal to zero assuming , that the boundary layer does not affect the properties of the interface we want to study . in the appendix  [ [ sec / ambiguity ] ]",
    "we show that this ambiguity does not affect the results .    as one can see from eq .   and",
    "eq .  , it is possible to relate the thermodynamic variables for an inhomogeneous fluid in the same way as it is done for a homogeneous one .",
    "however , unlike the homogeneous mixture , these variables contain gradient contributions .",
    "this means that local equilibrium for such a system is not satisfied .",
    "the local behavior of the mixture is determined not only by it s local properties but also by it s nearest surroundings . moreover , in contrast to the homogeneous description , the local properties now vary in the space .",
    "we have given explicit expressions for each thermodynamic quantity in the interfacial region .",
    "we have also determined how the thermodynamic potentials change with the change of the variables they depend on .",
    "an important part of the thermodynamic description is the relations between the rate of change of the thermodynamic variables , the gibbs relations .",
    "in contrast to a homogeneous system , for an inhomogeneous system , in particular the interfacial region , thermodynamic variables vary also in space . thus one can speak about the relation between the rates of change of thermodynamic variables for a given point in space , the ordinary gibbs relation .",
    "one has also to speak about the rates of change of the thermodynamic variables in space , the spacial gibbs relation .",
    "even though the thermodynamic potentials , particularly the specific helmholtz energy , depend on the spatial derivatives of the densities , we have shown that variation of these gradients do not contribute to the ordinary gibbs relations .",
    "thus , the ordinary gibbs relations have the ordinary form of the gibbs relations for the homogeneous mixture .",
    "the important observation here is , however , that the ordinary gibbs relations relate the inhomogeneous thermodynamic variables , i.e. those , which contain the gradient contribution . as the spatial derivatives of the temperature , chemical potentials and pressure tensor are zero in equilibrium",
    ", we can determine the spatial gibbs relation .",
    "the new term which appears because of the inhomogeneity is @xmath117 , which is only unequal to zero close to the surface .    for temperatures",

    "for molar densities we had the coefficients @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 and for densities per unit of volume @xmath86 .",

    "[ [ sec / nonuniform / matter ] ] and sec .  [",

    "one of the authors ( d.b . ) wants to thank edgar blokhuis for help and advise .",
    "we show here that ambiguities present in the definition of the specific helmholtz energy and the total thermodynamic differential of the specific helmholtz energy do not affect the validity of all the thermodynamic relations , derived in the present article .",
    "we do this for molar specific variables , the same arguments can be used for the specific variables per unit of volume .    the total helmholtz energy of a mixture @xmath123 can be expanded around homogeneous state as @xmath124 \\end{array}\\]]where the series is truncated after the second order terms . as it is shown in eq .",
