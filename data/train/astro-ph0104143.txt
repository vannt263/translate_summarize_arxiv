    "in the highest energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum , the energy range between 50 kev and 30 gev has been successfully covered by satellite based missions@xcite . at higher the energies steeply falling spectrum",
    "makes it impossible to observe the @xmath0ray sky by satellite based detectors .",
    "the ground based atmospheric erenkov technique has proved to be the most sensitive technique in exploring the celestial @xmath0rays in the energy range 300 gev - 10 tev .",
    "the basic detection technique in this case is to deploy one or several parabolic mirrors at the observation level fitted with fast photo tubes at the focus .",
    "very high energy celestial @xmath0rays initiate an electromagnetic cascade in the atmosphere as they enter the atmosphere .",
    "the electrons and positrons in the cascade , being relativistic , emit erenkov light as they propagate down the atmosphere resulting in a faint ( @xmath2 times the brightness of the star light background ) flash of light lasting a few nanoseconds .",
    "this fast erenkov flash is detected electronically by coincidence technique .",
    "however the main drawback of the technique is the presence of much more abundant cosmic ray background which severely limit the sensitivity of this technique .",
    "various ingenious techniques are employed to distinguish between the erenkov light produced by cosmic @xmath1rays from that by the cosmic rays . among these ,",
    "the imaging technique , wavefront sampling technique , angular and spectral separation techniques are currently employed by different experiments @xcite .    in spite of the necessity of carrying out these observations during clear , moon - less nights which scales to only about 10 - 15% duty cycle",
    ", the technique has been successful mainly due to two reasons .",
    "firstly , a large collection area which is @xmath3 times larger than the satellite detectors provides a high event rate . secondly , with high angular resolution and some recently developed @xmath0 hadron separation techniques @xcite provide high sensitivity to the method .",
    "large ground based telescopes based on this technique are now being built to cover the intermediate energy range of 30 - 300 gev @xcite .    in the absence of standard mono - energetic beams of cosmic rays or @xmath1rays",
    ", one has to depend on the simulation techniques to understand and optimize the detector response to these radiations . for this purpose",
    "we have carried out detailed simulations with vhe @xmath0rays and cosmic rays of various primary energies initiating extensive air showers in the atmosphere . in order to ensure the reliability of the conclusions drawn from these studies it is imperative to verify the correctness of the basic results derived from these simulations .",
    "there are a few simulation packages painstakingly developed by high energy physicists and we chose one of them called corsika @xcite developed by the kascade collaboration .",
    "corsika ( version 562 ) , @xcite has been used here to simulate erenkov light emission in the earth s atmosphere by the secondaries of the extensive air showers generated by cosmic ray primaries or @xmath4rays .",
    "this program simulates interactions of nuclei , hadrons , muons , electrons and photons as well as decays of unstable secondaries in the atmosphere .",
    "it uses egs4 code @xcite for the electromagnetic component of the air shower simulation and gheisha@xcite for the simulation of hadronic interactions at tev energies .",
    "the erenkov radiation produced within the specified bandwidth ( 300 - 550 @xmath5 ) by the charged secondaries is propagated to the ground .",
    "the us standard atmosphere parameterized by linsley @xcite has been used .",
    "the position , angle , time ( with respect to the first interaction ) and production height of each erenkov photon hitting the detector at the observation level are recorded .",
    "we have mainly used pachmarhi ( longitude : 78@xmath6 26@xmath7 e , latitude : 22@xmath6 28@xmath8 and altitude : 1075 @xmath9 ) as the observer s location where an array of 25 erenkov detectors each of area 4.35 @xmath10 is deployed in the form of a rectangular array .",
    "we have assumed 17 detectors in the e - w direction with a separation of 25 @xmath9 and 21 detectors in the n - s direction with a separation of 20 @xmath9 .",
    "this configuration , similar to the pachmarhi array of erenkov telescopes ( pact ) @xcite but much larger , is chosen so that one can study the core distance dependence of various observable parameters .",
    "simulations were also carried out at sea level and a location at an altitude of 2 @xmath11 above mean sea level .",
    "mono - energetic primaries consisting of @xmath4 rays and protons incident vertically on the top of the atmosphere with their cores at the centre of the array have been simulated in the present study .",
    "the longitudinal shower development profiles of erenkov photons in the atmosphere have been generated using corsika for @xmath0ray and proton primaries of various energies .",
    "tracks of charged particles are followed through in steps @xmath12 @xcite .    in the present work",
    "the erenkov photon growth curves have been obtained from the simulations for proton and @xmath0ray primaries of various energies and for the three observation levels mentioned above .",
    "these have been compared with those derived from independent empirical relations .",
    "the erenkov photon spectra as seen at the observation levels are then derived for various primary energies of @xmath0rays and protons after taking into account of the wavelength dependent attenuation in the atmosphere .",
    "then we estimate the relative fraction of uv photons in these spectra as a function of primary energy and observation level .",
    "for showers initiated by photons of energy @xmath13 the longitudinal shower development curve is derived from the equation for cascade curve under approximation a. the average number of electrons of all energies @xmath14 as a function of atmospheric depth @xmath15 , is given approximately , in the region where the number of particles is large , by @xcite :    @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the depth @xmath15 measured in units of radiation length in the atmosphere ( 37.2 @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 is the the electron critical energy at the depth @xmath17 .",
    "this is the energy below which the electron multiplication stops .",
    "it is approximately the energy at which radiation losses and collisional losses are equal and has a value 84.2 mev in air .",
    "the shower age parameter , @xmath20 , which is a measure of the stage of the longitudinal shower development , is given by :    @xmath21 @xmath20 = 1 at shower maximum while @xmath22 above the shower maximum and and @xmath23 below .",
    "the relation between the atmospheric height @xmath24 , ( as measured from sea level in @xmath9 ) and the depth , @xmath15 ( @xmath18 as measured from the top of atmosphere ) is taken from rao@xcite :    @xmath25 where the scale height is dependent on the atmospheric depth .",
    "the refractive index @xmath26 at a given height @xmath24 is assumed to be :    @xmath27 where @xmath28 is given by :    @xmath29    for calculating the electron growth curve the atmosphere is divided into slabs of thickness 333 @xmath9 , after the height of first interaction of the primary .",
    "the electron threshold energy for the production of erenkov radiation at a depth @xmath17 is given by    @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the electron rest mass ( 0.51 mev ) .",
    "the fraction of electrons with energy above the erenkov threshold is given by @xcite :    @xmath32 where @xmath33 = 26 _ mev _ when @xmath34 +   = @xmath35 for @xmath36 + the number of electrons above the erenkov threshold is then computed in each of the slabs . for each straight section of the electron path ,",
    "the number of erenkov photons produced per unit path - length is given by ,    @xmath37 in the wavelength band bounded by @xmath38 and @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the electron velocity and @xmath41 is the fine structure constant . assuming all the electrons in the cascade to be close to the shower axis and they travel with the velocity close to that of light in vacuum , the number of erenkov photons produced in a path - length @xmath42 (= 333 @xmath9 in the present case ) and in the wavelength range 300 - 550 @xmath5 at a depth @xmath43",
    "is then given by ,    @xmath44      because of the differences in the kinematics of shower development in the case of hadronic primaries the longitudinal development profiles too are different as compared to that of @xmath0ray primaries .",
    "using the scaling model for nuclear interactions , gaisser & hillas @xcite find that the average number of particles , @xmath45 at an atmospheric depth of @xmath43 , measured from the first point of interaction , in a shower initiated by a proton of energy @xmath46 ( gev ) can be adequately represented by the empirical relationship @xcite    @xmath47 where @xmath48 where @xmath49=0.045 , @xmath50=0.074 , @xmath51= 37.2 @xmath18 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 = proton interaction mean free path in air ( 70 @xmath18 ) .",
    "we chose the electron energy spectrum given by zatsepin and chudakov which is independent of the stage of cascade development @xcite .",
    "@xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the number of electrons of energy @xmath57 and all energies respectively at a depth @xmath15 , @xmath58 = 2.3@xmath59 and @xmath60 = 72 mev with @xmath57 in mev .",
    "even though this approximates well at shower maximum in the energy range 20 - 300 @xmath61 , the minor departure at other depths affects only the shape of the lateral distribution of erenkov photons and does not affect the present estimates significantly .",
    "the integral electron energy spectrum is then derived :    @xmath62    substituting @xmath63 for @xmath57 , the number of electrons above the erenkov threshold at a particular depth are calculated using the above equation .",
    "the longitudinal erenkov photon profiles are then derived for @xmath1rays of primary energy 50 , 100 , 250 , 500 and 1000 gev and protons of energy 100 , 200 , 500 , 1000 and 2000 gev .",
    "the growth curves are simulated using corsika for two primary energies for @xmath0rays ( 500 gev & 1000 gev ) and protons ( 1000 & 2000 gev ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows a comparison of the simulated longitudinal profiles for @xmath0 rays ( a & c ) as well as protons ( b & d ) with calculated profiles .",
    "the simulated profiles ( histograms ) are averaged over 30 showers for @xmath0 rays and 50 showers for protons .",
    "the agreement between the simulated and calculated longitudinal shower development profiles in terms of erenkov photons is good for @xmath0ray as well as proton primaries of energies considered here .",
    "table [ tab1 ] summarizes the total number of erenkov photons in these showers .",
    "the total number of erenkov photons agree with that from simulations within 1 & 2% for @xmath0ray and proton primaries respectively .",
    "0.3 cm    .quantitative comparison of the simulated and calculated erenkov photon growth curves in the atmosphere for @xmath0ray and proton primaries at two primary energies .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     figure [ fig7 ] shows a plot of @xmath64 and @xmath65 as a function of primary energy for three different observation levels .",
    "also shown in figure [ fig7 ] are the relative excess of uv content in proton showers _ vis - a - vis _ @xmath0ray showers , as a function of primary energy at three different altitudes .",
    "it can be readily seen from the figure that sensitivity to uv excess is better at higher altitudes as compared to sea level .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] shows radial variation of the ratio of uv to visible photons for @xmath0ray and proton primaries at an altitude of 1 _ km_. the relative uv fraction is marginally higher around the hump region since the photons in this region are contributed by higher energy electrons which have shortest path - length in air .",
    "the radial dependence of the uv fraction is more pronounced for proton primaries for reasons already mentioned before .",
    "in spite of the complexity of the interaction kinematics of high energy cosmic rays in the atmosphere , the average behavior as derived from detailed simulation studies agrees reasonably well with analytical calculations .",
    "this demonstrates that the simulation package does take into account almost all the interaction characteristics giving credence to the conclusions drawn from simulation studies .",
    "the position of shower maximum obtained by us agrees well with those of miller & westerhoff @xcite .",
    "armed with the above result we proceed to make analytical calculations for the production of erenkov light produced by both @xmath0rays and protons of various energies at three different observation altitudes .",
    "this is ideal to study the average shower properties as this is much faster than the detailed simulations .",
    "we then apply a detailed wavelength dependent corrections due to the attenuation of erenkov photons during their propagation in the atmosphere .",
    "this has been done for @xmath0ray and proton primaries of various energies and for three observation levels .",
    "it has been found that the fraction of the transmitted erenkov photons at an observation level of 2 @xmath11 above sea level is about 36% more than that at sea level .",
    "this is primarily because the average distance to shower maximum is reduced resulting in lesser absorption .",
    "even though the effective collection area is reduced at a higher altitude , the light intensities are larger near the shower core .",
    "in addition , increased uv content in the erenkov light makes higher observation levels better suited for atmospheric erenkov work .",
    "simulations carried out for mt .",
    "hopkins observatory site ( altitude of 2.3 @xmath11 ) suggest an advantage factor in the range 1.2 - 1.4 compared to sea level @xcite , is consistent with the present result .",
    "we also derived the observed erenkov photon spectrum for a @xmath0ray of energy 3 tev at an observation altitude of 2 @xmath11 .",
    "this spectrum agrees well with that reported by mirzoyan , _",
    "et  al._@xcite for hegra observation level .",
    "the use of a uv filter to preferentially accept erenkov light has been suggested even though its efficiency in improving the signal to noise ratio of an atmospheric erenkov telescope is in doubt @xcite . on the other hand pushing the sensitivity to near uv wavelengths does improve the system sensitivity @xcite . also using suitable filters to suppress the photo - tube sensitivity in the visual band , existing imaging telescopes",
    "have been modified so that observations could be made during moderately moonlit nights .",
    "this technique has been shown to be successful in detecting @xmath66ray signal from crab and mkn 421 despite higher energy threshold and reduced sensitivity @xcite .",
    "it has been observed by zyskin,_et al . , _",
    "@xcite that the relative signal strengths in the uv range ( 200 - 300 @xmath5 ) to that in the visible range ( 300 - 600 @xmath5 ) increases with the angular size of the image in the visible .",
    "it increases up to @xmath67 for large images(@xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the semi - major and semi - minor axis of the image in the optical ) .",
    "this could be due to the fact that those showers whose maximum is closer to the observation level produce larger erenkov images .",
    "this is equivalent to raising observation level which effectively reduces the attenuation of uv photons as discussed in  4.1 from the present calculations the relative signal strength at a primary proton energy of 4 tev ( energy threshold of zyskin _ et al . , _",
    "@xcite ) is estimated to be @xmath71 which is quite consistent with their measurement .",
    "it may be noticed that the wavelength ranges used by zyskin _",
    "et al . , _ is broader in uv and while the visible band in our estimate was modified to match theirs .",
    "however the observed erenkov photon spectrum falls steeply below @xmath72 , as could be seen in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "extending the wavelength range below 270 @xmath5 does not change the uv content significantly .",
    "we find that the relative strengths of uv photons to the visible is higher in the case of proton primaries by about 16% at 50 gev and decreases to 12% at 1 tev .",
    "hence , the hadron discrimination efficiency based on the uv content in erenkov light is relatively better at lower primary energies and at near core distances .",
    "thus , measurement of relative uv content of a shower could be a good parameter in order to discriminate against hadrons especially for large ground based arrays with low energy thresholds ( @xmath73 ) and employing the wavefront sampling technique @xcite .",
    "however one has to keep in mind that for this technique to be successful one has to make a very accurate ( better than @xmath74 ) estimate of the uv and visible light contents of the shower .",
