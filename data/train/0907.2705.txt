    "in this contribution , we describe the environment around our 1971 paper `` new dual quark models '' @xcite and the two companion papers `` the two faces of a dual pion - quark model '' @xcite and `` quantum solitons which are su(n ) fermions '' @xcite in 1971 and 1975 , which laid the foundations of non - abelian current - algebraic internal symmetry on the string .    the background for our contributions included many helpful discussions with other early workers , including h.m.chan , c. lovelace , h. ruegg and c. schmidt ( during kb s 1969 visit to cern ) as well as r. brower , s. klein , c. thorn , m. virasoro and j. weis ( with mbh at berkeley ) .",
    "both of us also acknowledge many discussions with y. frishman , g. segre , j. shapiro and especially s. mandelstam .",
    "later discussions with i. bars and w. siegel are also acknowledged by mbh . with apologies to many other authors then , we reference here only the work which was most influential in our early thinking : before veneziano , there had been widespread interest in the quark model of gell - mann and zweig , including the four - dimensional current algebra ( adler and dashen @xcite ) of quarks .      in 1970 , the work of fubini and veneziano @xcite together with the virasoro algebra @xcite provided an _ algebraic formulation _ of open bosonic string theory which we found quite exciting .",
    "the first ingredients of this formulation are the bosonic oscillators @xmath2= -m\\,g_{\\mu\\,\\nu}\\,\\delta_{m+n,0},\\nonumber\\\\ & & m , n\\in { \\mathbb z},\\,\\ , g= { \\rm diag}(1,-1,\\dots,-1)\\ , \\qquad \\mu,\\nu= 0,1 , ... 25\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which we have rescaled here as the modes of an abelian current algebra on the circle . the conformal - field - theoretic convention for the local currents associated to these modes are @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the fubini - veneziano fields and @xmath5 is canonically conjugate to the momenta @xmath6 .",
    "normal - ordered exponentials of the fubini - veneziano fields are the string vertex operators , to which we shall return below .    in our discussions we shall emphasize the mode algebras , but for various modern applications the complex variable @xmath7 in the local fields can be taken in many forms , including @xmath8 ( the circle or loop ) , @xmath9 ( left - movers on a closed string ) , the euclidean version @xmath10 for conformal field theory ( cft ) , or the real line for open strings .",
    "these alternate forms led to some confusion in the early days of string theory , but in fact most of the early work reviewed in this article was in the context of the open string , using the parametrization @xmath11 on the circle .    finally , the virasoro algebra of the critical open bosonic string is @xmath12&=&(m - n)\\ , l(m+n)+\\frac{26}{12}\\ , m\\ , ( m^{2 } -1)\\ , \\delta_{m+n , 0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the symbol @xmath13 is bosonic normal - ordering . under these generators",
    "the abelian currents @xmath14 covariantly transform with conformal weight equal to one .",
    "taken together , the algebraic statements in eqs .",
    "( 1.1)-(1.3 ) provided the first example of modern cft ( see belavin , polyakov and zamolodchikov @xcite ) .",
    "we have here taken an historical liberty , because the central extension of the virasoro algebra was not observed until 1974 , and even then only in a private communication from j. weis quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite ( chodos and thorn ) . throughout this article",
    "we adopt cft conventions , including an extra factor @xmath15 ( see eq . ( 1.1 ) ) for the mode expansions of virasoro primary fields with conformal weight @xmath16 .",
    "the cft convention guarantees that a given virasoro primary field creates a virasoro primary state of the same conformal weight as @xmath7 goes to @xmath17 on the vacuum ( in this case the zero - momentum vacuum @xmath18 of the open bosonic string ) . on the other hand",
    ", the extra factor @xmath15 must be removed for exact correspondence of the local fields with @xmath11 in early work on the open string .      as it appeared then , the open bosonic string had two deficiencies beyond the tachyonic ground state .",
    "in the first place lie - algebraic internal symmetries were implemented only by the multiplicative chan - paton factors @xcite , which live on the boundary of the string .",
    "second , the bosonic string had no spin , that is , no space - time fermions . our first attempt to solve the second problem was a generalization of chan - paton factors to include spin @xcite , but this multiplicative approach was unsuccessful because it included negative - norm states .",
    "it seemed natural then to approach the problems of spin and internal symmetry in a different way , by introducing new local `` quark '' fields on the string  now called _ world - sheet fermions _",
    "@xcite : @xmath19 whose modes obey anticommutation relations @xmath20_{+}&=&[\\bar{\\psi}^{i}(q),\\bar{\\psi}^{j}(p)]_{+ } = 0,\\cr [ \\psi_{i}(q),\\bar{\\psi}^{j}(p)]_{+}&=&\\delta^{j}_{i}\\,\\delta_{q+p,0 } , \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,q , p\\in { \\mathbb z}+\\frac{1}{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as in the four - dimensional quark model itself , the generic indices @xmath21 were designed so that the world - sheet fermions could be space - time spinors @xmath22 or carry internal symmetry or both @xmath23 .",
    "the virasoro generators of our world - sheet fermions are @xmath24 with fermionic normal - ordering and central charge @xmath25 equal to the number of ( @xmath26 ) pairs . in what follows",
    ", we often refer to our world - sheet fermions as the _",
    "dual quarks_.    under these virasoro generators , the dual quark fields @xmath27 are virasoro primary fields with conformal weight @xmath28 and trivial monodromy .",
    "the half - integer moding of the dual quark fields guaranteed a unique vacuum ( or ground state ) @xmath29 which is annihilated by the positive modes of both fields , and the adjoint operation is defined for internal symmetry as @xmath30 ( with a @xmath31 modification for spin ) . in either case , our virasoro generators satisfy the generalized hermiticity @xmath32 and the vacuum state conditions : @xmath33    with internal symmetry only , our dual quark models then provided the first examples of _ unitary _ cft , with a positive - definite hilbert space on a non - degenerate vacuum with conformal weight @xmath34 .",
    "in modern parlance , the half - integer moded complex bh fermions are related to anti - periodic weyl fermions on the world sheet , but it should be born in mind that fermionic world - sheet action formulations of open string theory had not been studied at that time .",
    "were these the first world - sheet fermions ?",
    "in fact , our work was essentially simultaneous with that of ramond @xcite : our paper was submitted in november of 1970 while ramond s paper with integer - moded majorana - weyl world - sheet fermions was submitted in january 1971 ; the two papers were published in the same issue of physical review . as we now know",
    "the r fermions @xmath35 , with their somewhat - counterintuitive space - time vector label @xmath36 and superconformal symmetry , provided the correct covariant description of space - time fermions and  in a perfect match to the r construction  half - integer moded majorana - weyl world - sheet fermions @xmath35 were later introduced for the bosonic sector by neveu and schwarz @xcite .",
    "for the historical record , the lure of our seemingly more physical space - time spinor fields @xmath22 persisted for some time , leading to many connections ( halpern @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , bardakci @xcite , halpern and thorn @xcite , @xcite and mandelstam @xcite , @xcite ) between our fields and those of the rns formulation ( we mention in particular the first example of half - integer - moded scalar fields in @xcite ) .",
    "our original intuition was however not realized until 1982 , when a world - sheet fermion with 10-dimensional majorana - weyl spinor indices was successfully incorporated by green and schwarz in the light - cone formulation of superstring theory @xcite .        for continuity with the bosonic string ,",
    "we begin this discussion with a footnote of our 1971 paper  which observed that the spatial components @xmath37 of the abelian currents ( 1.1),(1.2 ) could be constructed out of our world - sheet fermions @xcite : @xmath38 this result is now recognized as a simple but important part of bose - fermi equivalence on the open string , a subject to which we will return below .",
    "our next construction was the independent discovery of affine lie algebra in physics @xcite , still sometimes called the `` dual quark model '' , in which the non - abelian currents are naturally constructed as dual - quark bilinears with conformal weight 1 : @xmath39      here @xmath41 can be any irreducible matrix representation of any simple lie algebra @xmath42 , with structure constants @xmath43 and killing metric @xmath44 .",
    "then one finds that the modes of the dual quark - model currents @xmath45 are the generators of the _ affine lie algebra _",
    "@xmath46&=&i\\,{f_{a b}}^{c}\\,j_{c}(m+n)+ m\\,\\left(k\\ , \\eta_{a b}\\right)\\,\\delta_{m+n , 0},\\cr a,\\,b,\\,c & = & 1 . .",
    ".dim(g),\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,m,\\,n\\in { \\mathbb z}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the quantity @xmath47 in the central term is called the _ level _ of the affine algebra .",
    "( we assume in this article that the highest root - length squared of lie @xmath42 is two , in which case the level in the dual quark models is also equal to the dynkin index of irreducible representation t. ) affine lie algebra is also known as centrally- extended non - abelian current algebra on the circle . in this construction , the dual - quark fields @xmath48 transform respectively in the @xmath49 representations of lie @xmath42  the lie algebra being generated by the zero modes @xmath50 of the affine algebra .",
    "in fact our first example of this construction used the @xmath51 cartesian gell - mann matrices @xmath52 of @xmath0 ( and the dynkin index of the fundamental of @xmath1 is 1 )  so the _ first concrete representation of affine lie algebra _ was @xmath53 , that is , level one of affine @xmath0 ( see also sec .",
    "1.8 ) . in this case , as in the four - dimensional quark model itself , the dual - quark fields @xmath27 transform respectively in the @xmath54 representations of @xmath0 .",
    "dual quark - model constructions of the currents of @xmath55 and @xmath56 were also included in our 1971 paper , and further studied along with those of higher lorentz algebras in the first companion paper @xcite .",
    "the dual quark models of @xmath57 were given later in the second companion paper @xcite .",
    "because connections between open strings and field theory were not understood at the time , our interpretation of the central terms in our string - theoretic constructions of affine lie algebras on the circle was based on the presence of such a term in the abelian mode algebra ( 1.1 ) of the open bosonic string  to which our constructions reduced in the abelian case .",
    "this understanding was supported by our fermionic construction ( see eq .",
    "( 1.7 ) above ) of the modes of the abelian current algebra .",
    "on the other hand , we often think now of the central term in affine lie algebra as an analogue on the circle of the equal - time schwinger term @xcite ( indeed , see eq .",
    "( 3.10 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , so we briefly sketch the history of @xmath1 current algebra in the two - dimensional lorentz - invariant quantum field theory of massless free fermions : the equal - time schwinger term in @xmath1 current algebra on the line was first computed in 1969 ( see coleman , gross and jackiw @xcite ) , and the one - dimensional @xmath1 current algebras of the light - cone currents @xmath58  with one - dimensional schwinger terms  were given later by dashen and frishman @xcite .",
    "in fact however the momenta are continuous in this non - compactified , lorentz - invariant context , so our open - string mode forms of the fermions and affine lie algebra on the circle @xcite do not appear in these papers .    for a modern introduction to affine lie algebras in cft , see the work by gepner and witten @xcite and also the representation theory for all integer levels in kac @xcite . in physics",
    "the affine algebras have sometimes also been called kac - moody algebras , but this term is more properly reserved for the general algebraic systems including affine and hyperbolic algebras ( see sec . 1.8 ) .      the _ affine - sugawara constructions _",
    "@xcite @xcite are the simplest realization of virasoro generators as quadratic forms on the generators of affine lie algebras , @xmath59&=&(m- n)\\,l_{g}(m+n)+\\frac{c_{g}}{12}\\,m\\ , ( m^{2 } -1)\\,\\delta_{m+n,0},\\cr c_{g}&=&\\frac{2\\,k\\,dim(g)}{2\\,k+q_{g}}. \\label{suga}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath60 is the quadratic casimir of lie @xmath42 , which in our present root - normalization is twice the dual coxeter number of @xmath42 . the original sugawara model @xcite , sommerfield @xcite , bardakci , frishman and halpern @xcite , bardakci and halpern @xcite , gross and halpern @xcite , coleman , gross and jackiw @xcite was in four dimensions on a different current algebra , the so - called algebra of fields .",
    "the affine - sugawara ( or sugawara - like ) constructions in eq .",
    "( 1.11 ) hold for all integer levels of any affine lie algebra .",
    "the first example of the affine - sugawara construction @xcite used the @xmath53 dual quark - model currents of the previous section ( the dual coxeter number of @xmath1 is @xmath61 ) .",
    "the affine - sugawara construction on the level - one currents of affine @xmath62 was also given in our 1971 paper , and extended in the first companion paper @xcite to the construction on the level - one currents of affine so(3,1 ) and higher lorentz algebra .",
    "the case of @xmath57 was given later in @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the prefactors @xmath63 in these constructions follow from careful consideration of the normal ordering @xmath13 of the current modes .",
    "the affine - sugawara constructions , being quartic in our dual quarks , were called `` current - current '' or `` spin - spin '' interactions in those days , and models which used the dual quarks or the affine - sugawara constructions instead of extra dimensions on the open string were known as `` additive '' models .    in physics the general form ( 1.11 ) of the affine - sugawara construction",
    "was first given by knizhnik and zamolodchikov @xcite thirteen years after our examples , and used by these authors to find the general kz equations . in the same year , the important paper by witten @xcite gave the action formulation and non - abelian bosonization of these operator systems , leading to their understanding  especially at higher level  as interacting quantum field theories of the wzw type @xcite .",
    "the independent history of the affine - sugawara constructions in mathematics is noted in sec .",
    "1.8 .    in this connection",
    ", we also sketch the history of the @xmath64 sugawara - like constructions in two - dimensional lorentz - invariant field theories of massless free fermions : using a point - splitting regularization of the products of u(n ) currents , ref .",
    "@xcite showed the equivalence of the two - dimensional analogue @xmath65 of the original sugawara stress - tensor to the free - fermionic stress - tensor \\{@xmath66 , and ( building on the abelian case in ref .",

    "we begin this discussion with the results in our paper @xcite . in particular for our example on @xmath53",
    ", we first studied the addition to the affine - sugawara construction of a term @xmath67 for all constant @xmath68 , which gave virasoro generators with _ continuous _",
    "su(3)-symmetry breaking .",
    "this was the first example of what is today known as inner - automorphic twists or c - fixed _ conformal deformations _ ( freericks and halpern @xcite ) .",
    "next we looked for su(3)-symmetry breaking solutions on @xmath53 when the virasoro generators were assumed to have the more general quadratic form @xmath69 with constant coefficients @xmath70 .",
    "we stated that solutions beyond the affine - sugawara construction for the coefficients @xmath71 existed , giving virasoro generators with _",
    "@xmath0-symmetry breaking .",
    "this was the first _ implicit _ mention of coset constructions , but we gave no details about these solutions  noting only that they all had `` infinite - degeneracy '' problems .",
    "this issue ( amplified in our non - additive `` spin - orbit '' constructions of the next section of this reference ) was that the solutions to the virasoro conditions come in _ commuting _",
    "`` k - conjugate pairs '' of virasoro generators @xmath72=0 $ ] which sum to the affine - sugawara construction @xmath73 . this phenomenon was called _",
    "k - conjugation covariance _ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the associated spectral degeneracy of each commuting k - conjugate partner , due to the other , was called k - degeneracy .    the first _ explicit _",
    "examples of non - abelian coset constructions were given in the companion paper `` the two faces of a dual pion - quark model '' @xcite , which solved the virasoro conditions for all possible ( bh quartic ) conformal spin - spin interactions among the four - dimensional dual quark bilinears t , v , a , p and s ( \\{@xmath74 and so on ) .",
    "all 31 of these conformal constructions were affine - sugawara or coset constructions , and a number of these were included explicitly in the applications of the text ( see eqs .",
    "( 3.7)(3.9 ) and ( 3.14 ) ) .",
    "each of these results was presented as a decomposition of an affine - sugawara construction into a commuting k - conjugate pair of conformal constructions  which we would today write as @xmath75=0\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the original symmetry algebra , @xmath76 is any subalgebra of @xmath42 and @xmath77 is the coset space .",
    "we will focus here on the lie - algebraic identifications in the simplest case , given as @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( 3.14 ) of the paper .",
    "all three sets of virasoro generators are defined in eqs .",
    "( 3.9 ) and ( 3.14 ) as different linear combinations of the bh quartics @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and it is not difficult to see that that @xmath81 and @xmath82 are affine - sugawara constructions respectively on @xmath55 and @xmath83 . therefore , eq . ( 3.14 ) can be read as the k - conjugate decomposition @xmath84 into the commuting k - conjugate parters on so(3,1 ) and so(4,1)/so(3,1 ) .",
    "in fact , this result was checked explicitly with the identities given in the text between the bh dual - quark bilinears t , a and certain five - dimensional ns bilinears ( see eq . ( 2.9 ) of the text ) . using these identities ,",
    "it was noted that each quartic bh virasoro generator collapses to an ns bilinear , the affine - sugawara constructions @xmath81 and @xmath82 on @xmath55 and @xmath83 being equal respectively to the four- and five - dimensional quadratic ns virasoro generators , while the non - abelian coset construction @xmath85 ( with central charge @xmath86 ) is equal to the quadratic virasoro generators of the fifth ns operator alone .",
    "similar quartic - to - bilinear equivalences had been seen earlier in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the general form of the coset construction for all @xmath87 @xmath88 was given by goddard , kent and olive @xcite fourteen years after our examples .",
    "the k - degeneracy of the virasoro construction on @xmath77 is now understood as the local gauge invariance associated to the h - currents of the commuting k - conjugate affine - sugawara construction @xmath89 on h .",
    "it should be emphasized however that the coset constructions are by no means the end of cft constructions on the currents of affine lie algebras : our original method of solving for the coefficients @xmath90 in quadratic forms @xmath91 eventually led to the completely k - conjugation - covariant _ virasoro master equation _ ( halpern and kiritsis @xcite ) , which includes the affine - sugawara constructions and the coset constructions as very special cases ( with rational central charge ) of irrational conformal field theory ( halpern , kiritsis , obers and clubok @xcite ) .",
    "there is one more important strand which belongs in this story  namely the second companion paper in 1975 `` quantum solitons which are su(n ) fermions '' @xcite , which described using compactified spatial dimensions on the open string ",
    "the first vertex - operator constructions of world - sheet fermions and affine lie algebra .    by 1972 ,",
    "interest among physicists was shifting back to field theory .",
    "we mention in particular the bose - fermi equivalence of the sine - gordon and interacting thirring model studied by coleman @xcite and mandelstam @xcite in 1975 .",
    "( see also the free - field bosonization of the single fermion bilinears by kogut and susskind @xcite . )",
    "one of us ( mbh ) realized that  with two observations  this development could be applied to our 1971 non - abelian current - algebraic constructions on the string .",
    "the first observation was that mandelstam s normal - ordered line - integral construction of a single interacting fermion could be easily generalized to @xmath92 interacting fermions on the line by including appropriate klein transformations @xcite .",
    "this led to bosonic realizations of centrally - extended @xmath1 current algebras on the line , and the equivalence of various generalized sine - gordon models with corresponding sets of interacting @xmath64 thirring models .",
    "in particular , the @xmath1 currents were constructed from ( n-1 ) independent two - dimensional bosons , showing the roots of su(n ) in the off - diagonal currents .",
    "( see also the extension of these ideas to the bosonization of two - dimensional non - abelian gauge theories @xcite  and in particular eq.(3.13 ) of this reference . )",
    "the second observation in the 1975 paper was that , for massless free fermions and bosons , there was a structural parallel between mandelstam s fermions on the line and particular string vertex operators on the circle .",
    "indeed , a formal projective map ( from the line to the circle ) was given between each two - dimensional left- and right- mover free - field construction in the field theories and a _ pair _ of our open - string counterparts on the circle , a structure which corresponded in fact to closed strings .",
    "these points were emphasized in the second appendix `` connections with dual models '' of that paper  which also gave the vertex - operator construction of many world - sheet fermions @xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 are the fubini - veneziano fields and @xmath95 are the klein transformations of the text .",
    "this relation guaranteed that the world - sheet fermions were virasoro primary fields with conformal weight @xmath28 under the open - string bosonic virasoro generators , and we identified these constructions as our half - integer - moded dual quarks @xcite .",
    "although it was not explicitly mentioned , this identification had in fact been checked from vacuum expectation values using the natural identification of the bosonic zero - momentum vacuum @xmath96 as the unique vacuum @xmath29 annihilated by the positive modes of the dual quarks .",
    "the vertex - operator construction of @xmath57 can therefore be obtained immediately in a single step by direct substitution of the fermionic vertex - operators ( 1.14 ) into our dual quark - model construction @xmath97 of the currents .",
    "we regret having omitted this last simple step in the appendix , thinking it implicit in the context of the paper : the off - diagonal currents @xmath98 of @xmath57 follow immediately , showing the roots of @xmath1 on ( n-1 ) independent fields , and the diagonal currents of @xmath57 are a derivative of the same ( n-1 ) fields , while the extra @xmath99 current is a derivative of the normalized orthogonal sum @xmath100 .",
    "we state here the result only for @xmath101 @xmath102 which is in fact the only case where ( as discussed in the text ) the klein transformations can be chosen to cancel .",
    "the charged currents @xmath103 of @xmath104 show the roots of @xmath105 , and results for the neutral current @xmath106 and the extra @xmath99 current @xmath107 are of course closely related to our earlier bose - fermi relation on the string given in eq .",
    "( 1.7 ) above .",
    "we concluded that we had constructed a current - algebraic @xmath105 from a single compactified spatial dimension , and also that the paper was equivalent to constructing as much as current - algebraic @xmath108 from the compactified extra spatial dimensions of the critical open bosonic string .",
    "( quantized extra momenta were well - known in early open - string theory ) . in the following year",
    ", banks , horn and neuberger @xcite again studied the bosonization of @xmath1 thirring models , this time with periodic boundary conditions as @xmath109 . translating the fermionic zero modes of their solution at fixed @xmath110 into vertex - operators on the string ,",
    "one now understands that integer - moded complex versions ( cr ) of world - sheet r fermions and @xmath57 currents can also be obtained from the @xmath111 vertex operators by choosing degenerate ground states with @xmath112 for each of the @xmath61 momenta .    in later work ( see for example frenkel , lepowsky and meurman @xcite and lepowsky @xcite )",
    ", one learns that the true vacuum of the full cft is the bh vacuum @xmath113 and products of bh currents on the bh vacuum live on the root - lattice of su(n ) .",
    "the bh theory is itself reducible , containing many copies of the integrable representations of su(n )  each copy living at different @xmath16 s on the weight lattice of su(n ) .",
    "so ended our three contributions @xcite , @xcite , @xcite to current - algebraic internal symmetry on the string . loosely speaking",
    ", these papers also marked the end of the first string era , as an increasing number of physicists  including ourselves  turned their interest to gauge theory for a decade .",
    "we were therefore fundamentally surprised to see in 1985 that the seminal paper on the heterotic string ( gross , harvey , martinec and rohm @xcite ) used the 1980 vertex - operator ( root - lattice ) construction of @xmath114 by frenkel and kac @xcite . following this , we contacted james lepowsky and igor frenkel , who patiently exchanged information with us about these parallel developments in mathematics and physics , including explanations of the first vertex - operator construction ( twisted @xmath104 ) in mathematics ( lepowsky and wilson @xcite ) , and the earlier kac - moody algebras @xcite , @xcite  which include the affine and hyperbolic algebras as special cases .    in mathematics ,",
    "our 1971 dual quark - model construction of @xmath53 is known as the _ first concrete representation of affine lie algebra _ , including the first explicit central term . in this connection",

'' .    in conclusion , one might say that for us , ignorance was bliss  or , more optimistically  that physicists can create mathematics . in either case , it is clear that both fields have profited handsomely from this confluence .      in our historical discussion",
    "above we have focused on the discovery of current - algebraic cft on the string worldsheet , but to complete the modern perspective we should emphasize that this is just one of many mathematical methods which have been found and developed in string theory . over the last 25 years , this domain has been the main source of new methods in theoretical physics that deeply changed the discipline and had many other applications in different areas , such as statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics .",
    "these developments involved the latest mathematical advances in algebra , topology and geometry .",
    "some of these results ( such as the affine algebras described here ) were first discovered in string theory and then studied systematically by mathematicians , while others were imported from mathematics and made clear and practical by the string applications .    this communication and cross - fertilization has also had a large impact in mathematics , where the field theory methods are now well appreciated",
