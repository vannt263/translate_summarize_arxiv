    "since the pioneering work of oepik ( 1922 ) , it has been understood that rotational velocities and apparent magnitudes could be used to infer extragalactic distances ( rubin 1995 ) .",
    "work on correlations between rotational velocities and diameter or luminosity in the 1960s and early 1970s ( roberts 1969 , bottinelli 1971 , balkowski 1974 , shostak 1975 , roberts 1975 , sandage & tammann 1976 ) led to the definitive formulation of the tully - fisher relation ( tully & fisher 1977 ; hereafter tf ) which has become one of the most powerful and widely used tools for studying cosmic velocity fields in the local universe ( cf .",
    "strauss & willick 1995 for a review ) .",
    "the tf relation is an empirical correlation between some suitably defined measure of the `` peak '' circular velocity ( or linewidth ) , @xmath4 , and the total absolute magnitude , @xmath5 , of a spiral galaxy , such that @xmath6 .",
    "together , these two parameters define a plane of structural parameters for spiral galaxies which may reflect the way they were initially formed or perhaps suggest the presence of self - regulating processes of star formation in galactic disks .",
    "there are several models of galaxy formation which predict of a correlation between the luminosity and rotation velocity for spiral galaxies ( fall & efstathiou 1980 , faber 1982 , gunn 1982 , blumenthal  1984 , ashman 1990 , cole 1994 , eisenstein & loeb 1995 , eisenstein 1996 ) .",
    "a correlation is expected , as both luminosity and disk rotational velocity depend on galaxy mass .",
    "an alternative model for the tf relation involves dissipative galaxy formation in which regulated star formation , or the ability of the galaxy to retain gas ejected from stars and supernovae , is determined by the amount of baryonic matter in the halo . in this model ,",
    "the tf relation arises as a natural `` prediction '' with negligible scatter ( white 1991 , kauffmann 1993 , silk 1995 , 1997 ) .",
    "the residuals in the tf relation must therefore reflect fluctuations in the detailed formation and enrichment history of galactic halos .",
    "evolution and environmental effects are therefore likely to modify the shape of the tf relation in different environments and would suggest that a true universal tf relation @xmath7 does not exist .",
    "various tf calibrations will be obtained depending upon the choice of photometric bandpass and measure of rotational speed .",
    "these , in addition to corrections for various intrinsic , environmental , and instrumental biases , all contribute to the shape , zero - point , and scatter of the tf relation .",
    "it is now well understood that the slope and zero - point of the tf relation depend strongly on aperture and bandpass and that a smaller dispersion is obtained for near - ir ( nir ) bandpasses ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) than for the @xmath10 or @xmath4 bands . as first argued by aaronson and coworkers in the 80 s ( aaronson 1989 and references therein )",
    ", infrared photometry suffers less from galactic and internal absorption corrections than do bluer bandpasses .",
    "moreover , it is mostly sensitive to the underlying evolved stellar population which best traces the optical mass and thus correlates more tightly with the maximum rotational speed or , total galaxy mass .",
    "inclinations are also better determined at infrared wavebands since the overall image is smoother ( peletier & willner 1993 ) .",
    "there is a well - known trend of increasing tf slopes toward longer wavelengths ; representative ranges for the @xmath11 and @xmath9 bandpasses are roughly 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 .",
    "the larger slope observed at @xmath9-band by aaronson ( 1982 ) was shown to be largely due to aperture effects ( willick 1991 ) .",
    "pierce & tully ( 1992 ) also obtain a steep slope at h which is mostly due to their `` inverse '' fitting approach .",
    "] respectively ( strauss & willick 1995 , willick 1997 , hereafter w97 ) .",
    "the typical slope for a linear tf relation is close to 7.5 for the red and infrared bands indicating that @xmath12 .",
    "the typical intrinsic rms dispersion of the best forward tf calibrations , with carefully measured ccd magnitudes and inclinations , is between 0.25 - 0.40 mag ( @xmath13 ) or a 12 - 20% distance error .",
    "tf scatters as low as 0.1 mag have been reported for pruned samples with very specific selection criteria ( bothun & mould 1987 , pierce & tully 1992 , rood & williams 1993 , bernstein 1994 , raychaudhury 1997 , hereafter r97 ) but these do not reflect the normal population sampled in larger tf surveys .",
    "recent nir tf investigations in @xmath0 and @xmath14 bandpasses have yielded comparable , if not smaller , tf dispersions than similar @xmath9-band tf calibrations ( pierce & tully 1992 , willick 1991 , han 1991 , courteau 1992 ( hereafter c92 ) , mathewson 1992 ( hereafter mat ) , peletier & willner 1993 , schommer 1993 , bernstein 1994 , w97 , giovanelli 1997 ( hereafter g97 ) , r97 ) .",
    "no advantage is gained by imaging at yet longer wavelengths . as underscored by rhee ( 1996 ) , the @xmath15-band tf scatter is significantly larger on account of a less stable sky background and greater sensitivity to stellar population effects ( regan & vogel 1994 , rhoads 1997 ) .",
    "the latter will induce greater uncertainty in inclination estimates as well .",
    "tf scatter increases significantly at longer wavelengths where emission is mostly dominated by dust . in fact , the tf relation disappears beyond 10@xmath16 m , though the greater scatter reported in the @xmath17-band is also largely due to higher instrumental noise and smaller galaxy fluxes ( malhotra 1997 ) . while photometric bandpass is an important contributor to the tf slope and zero - point , the specific definition of linewidths is equally fundamental . for example , the tf calibrations for mat and han - mould galaxies are both based on i - band imaging yet they differ in slope by as much as a unit due to different linewidth definitions ( w97 ) .",
    "the former study uses resolved optical rcs ( orcs ) and the latter is based on integrated radio linewidths .",
    "there is thus strong impetus to understand systematic effects due to the choice of linewidths .",
    "besides _ intrinsic _ or _ cosmic _ scatter , raw linewidths _ per se _ are the leading source of dispersion in the overall tf error budget ( schommer 1993 , c92 ) .",
    "photometric inclination errors are a close second ( pierce & tully 1988 , peletier & willner 1991 , willick 1991 , c92 ) .",
    "the magnitude dispersion induced by inclination scatter ( for a given internal extinction correction ) is only @xmath18 0.04 - 0.05 mag , and the total error on fully processed magnitudes is typically 0.06 - 0.08 mag ( schommer 1993 , courteau 1996 ) .",
    "linewidths are more severely impacted .",
    "inclination errors account for about 0.10 mag of the total linewidth error which is typically 0.20 mag ( c92 , g97 ) .",
    "this is greater than the dispersion of @xmath19 induced by axisymmetric deviations in galactic disks ( franx & de zeeuw 1992 , rix & zaritzky 1995 ) .",
    "other sources collectively labelled as `` cosmic scatter '' may contribute a substantial share of the tf error budget but none independently as large as that from raw linewidth measurements ( w97 show that the overall cosmic scatter is @xmath18 0.30 mag ) .",
    "one must therefore proceed with procrustean care when defining a tf linewidth .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that the tf residuals are mostly gaussian ( w97 ) and not a function of any likely `` third parameter '' such as central and mean surface brightnesses , bulge - to - disk ratios , rc shape , concentration indices , morphological type , colors , etc .",
    "( schlegel 1995 , courteau & rix 1997 ( cr97 ) , w97 ; see however g97 , giraud 1986 , bothun & mould 1987 ) .",
    "spiral galaxies , in this sense , truly define a one - parameter sequence .",
    "after correction for various observational effects , the tf dispersion appears to have been reduced to its minimum dispersion in the luminosity - linewidth plane of spiral galaxies .",
    "measurements of tf rotational velocities have primarily relied on single - dish radio observations of neutral hydrogen at 21 cm . however , the restricted sky coverage of the arecibo and nanay radio - telescopes , lack of correlator power of array instruments , and lower sensitivity of steerable dishes constitute crucial limitations for any -based tf survey .",
    "emission lines traced in the optical domain provide a most adequate substitute to 21 cm emission . the good match between radio and optical velocity widths",
    "has been emphasized by thonnard ( 1983 ) and further verified by courteau & faber ( 1988 ) , c92 , mat , and vogt ( 1994 ) .",
    "considerable effort has been invested in recent years in large tf surveys based on orcs or integrated optical profiles ( dressler & faber 1990 , c92 , mat , schommer 1993 , vogt 1994 , schlegel 1995 , g97 . )",
    "the goal of this paper is to address technical issues which pertain to the extraction and analysis of long - slit optical spectra for tf applications .",
    "we present below a detailed account of the acquisition and calibration of long - slit orcs for tf applications .",
    "we use a sample of 304 ugc field sb - sc spirals with spectra and @xmath0-band photometry drawn from the collection of field sb - sc spirals of courteau ( 1992 ; hereafter c92 ) .",
    "this sample is also referred to as `` courteau - faber '' ( hereafter cf ) .",
    "multiple observations for 62 galaxies combine for a total of 132 spectra which will be used to study systematics and errors .",
    "sample selection , catalog information , redshift histograms , sky distribution , and photometric reductions were all presented in courteau ( 1996 ; hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the division of this paper is as follow : in  2 we discuss the spectroscopic observations and data reduction .",
    "the extraction of rotation curves from resolved emission lines is discussed in  3 and in  4 , we compare our results with the long - slit rcs of rubin and coworkers , vogt ( 1994 ) , and the fabry - perot rcs of amram ( 1992 , 1994 ) .",
    "the reader familiar with rc extractions can skip to  5 without loss of continuity .",
    "we address various issues of rc shapes and fitting models in  5 , which includes a brief discussion of the applicability of the `` universal rotation curve '' of persic , salucci , & stel ( 1996 ; hereafter pss ) .",
    "we introduce various definitions of velocity measurements for tf use both from resolved rcs and integrated profiles in  6 . in  7 , we make use of repeat observations to investigate the internal stability of our data .",
    "corrections to resolved and integrated linewidths are shown in  8 , and we assemble a table of corrected data in  9 .",
    "optical tf calibrations are derived in  10 and we examine the tight match between optical and radio linewidths in  11 .",
    "three appendices include a ) a presentation of all the cf rcs , two - sided and folded , and best - fitting models ; b ) model parameters for all fitted cf orcs and the 958 orcs from the compilation of mat ; and c ) a discussion on intensity - weighted centroids and the use of parabolic interpolation for binned data .    throughout the paper",
    ", we make the distinction between three measures of rotational linewidths .",
    "we shall refer to the velocity separation between the approaching and receding sides of the resolved rc as ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the width of any one - dimensional ( integrated ) rotation profile , be it a fully convolved 21 cm spectrum or a co - added or unresolved optical spectrum , will be called @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) . a velocity measured from a one - sided resolved rotation curve",
    "will simply be denoted as @xmath4 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "physical scales are calculated using = 70 .",
    "spectroscopic observations were made at lick observatory using the uv schmidt cassegrain spectrograph on the shane 3.0 m telescope ( miller & stone 1987 ) and at las campanas with the modular spectrograph on the 2.5 m du  pont telescope .",
    "table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of both instrumental setups .",
    "a total of 453 spectra , including repeats , was collected at lick ( 43 nights ) and las campanas ( 1 night courtesy of alan dressler ) . only ten spectra showed no measurable signal .",
    "the final collection of rcs includes measurements for 304 galaxies , 62 of them were observed more than once .",

    "typically , the rotation curve ends just beyond the optical radius ( defined here as 3.2 disk scale lengths - see fig .",
    "most galaxies were fully sampled within the 2slit .    as in paper",
    "i , the bulk of our reductions was based on the interactive image - reduction package vista originally developed at lick observatory ( lauer , stover , & terndrup 1983 ) .",
    "the reduction procedures described below are available from the author as vista routines .",
    "red spectra of spiral galaxies at low redshifts typically show the prominent nebular lines of @xmath336563 , @xmath346548,6583 , and @xmath346716,6731 with a relative range of intensities .",
    "while nuclear may sometimes exceed in strength the disk emission is usually stronger at than and .",
    "the line is also comparable to or more extended spatially than the other four emission features .",
    "addition of these lines would only marginally improve the rotation curve solutions , and they were left out for simplicity . in this paper , we will thus focus solely on the reduction of rcs .",
    "steps were taken to assemble the appropriate calibrations to transform ccd frames from a distorted row - column pixel space to an orthogonal wavelength - spatial map .",
    "the ccd frames were then re - binned on a regular spacing grid and re - sampled such that wavelength and radial increments are constant within each bin .",
    "standard calibration material includes high signal - to - noise dome flats ( with same slit opening as galaxies ) and a series of short ( bias ) and long dark frames .",
    "no twilight flats were taken .",
    "he - ne - ar comparison lamp exposures were taken at the beginning and end of each night , and the wavelength calibration zero - point was determined directly from the night emission skylines .",
    "the line - curvature was mapped from the calibration spectra whereas `` s - distortion '' mapping was modelled directly from the galaxy s continuum .",
    "the baseline level ( dc offset ) was removed as in paper i. we also mapped and removed the fixed - pattern noise along the slit direction due to uniform dark current .",
    "all the images were divided by a map of the pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations in the detector .",
    "the noise - variance frames described in  3.2 were measured prior to flat - fielding to exclude contributions from the dome , sky , and scattered - light backgrounds .",
    "this ensures proper error propagation .",
    "ccd images were also corrected for cosmetic defects .",
    "hot pixels and bad columns were replaced by a local second - order polynomial fit .",
    "automatic cosmic - ray rejection requires more delicate attention , especially near emission lines .",
    "cosmic rays hits are usually more compact than real spectral features but an uneven overlap of two or more such events will easily mimic localized emission features .",
    "cosmic ray removal was thus performs interactively .",
    "the `` s - distortion '' was finally removed from all the bias - subtracted and flat - fielded frames via inverse - shifting of a smooth model from the galaxy continuum .",
    "the amplitude of this distortion at the slit center varied from 1 to 3 pixels across the full spectral range .",
    "the baseline , dark subtraction , flat - fielding , removal of cosmetic defects , and correction for s - distortion were all done ( in that order ) in batch mode using custom procedures in vista .",
    "a polynomial pixel - wavelength fit was extracted from each he - ne - ar calibration spectrum using interactive line identification .",
    "eight to thirteen unblended lines were identified in each of the lamp spectra , and a third - order polynomial was fit to derive a dispersion curve .",
    "the rms residuals in the wavelength solution were of the order of 0.05 pixel , which corresponds to 0.051     and 0.076    ( or about 2.5  at ) for lick and las campanas data respectively .",
    "the precision of most centroiding programs is only about 1/20@xmath35 to 1/40@xmath35 of a pixel , and 0.05 pixel residual is thus satisfactory . barring zero - point flexure shifts ,",
    "the dispersion solutions were very stable over a run .",
    "the same calibration lamps were used to model the effects of line - curvature .",
    "the spectra were re - binned along the dispersion axis into a logarithmic wavelength scale to provide equal velocity interval per pixel .",
    "an example of a flat - fielded and rectified spectrum is shown in fig . 1 for ugc 1437 .",
    "we used position angles listed in the uppsala catalog of galaxies ( ugc ) to align the slit of the spectrograph with the galaxy s major axis .",
    "these were found to be in excellent agreement ( @xmath36 ) with our measured values from @xmath0-band ccd surface photometry ( paper i ) .",
    "extraction of a final rotation curve requires a few more steps ; zero - point adjustment of the dispersion solution for flexure shifts , construction of a noise - variance map , identification of the galaxy s center , sky subtraction , and removal of night - sky emission lines and galaxy continuum , tests using a cross - correlation approach to determine the center of the galaxy automatically showed that the choice of a good template is critical .",
    "the center of bright late - type spirals usually shows strong lines of and weaker pair . since a number of those exhibit /reversal in their center , we opted for an interactive intensity - weighted marking of the center .",
    "it is still difficult to define a true dynamical center using this technique since the strength of the emission lines does not necessarily correlate with the depth of the central potential .",
    "moreover , 20% of the sampled galaxies showed no continuum and/or nuclear emission .",
    "in such cases , an eyeball estimate of the center was made .",
    "a more reliable galaxian center was redefined via parametric modeling of the map of velocity centroids ( see  5 ) .    to quantify and correct for the effects of flexure",
    ", the 2d spectra were first binned on a linear wavelength scale ( with line curvature taken into account ) to extract a spectrum of the night - sky airglow from the galaxy sky background .",
    "the zero - point of the dispersion solution was obtained by comparing the skylines of and oh transitions with a list of reference wavelengths ( osterbrock & martel 1992 ) .",
    "the effects of flexure shifts on the relative measurement of rcs are completely negligible but the redshifts themselves are directly affected .",
    "gravity and telescope motion can contribute absolute shifts as great as 4 pixels .",
    "the skylines and sky background were removed by interpolating the regions above and below the galaxy emission with a second - order polynomial . in few cases where",
    "the galaxy was too extended and filled the slit , we interpolated the sky spectrum from both sides of the emission complex ( + ) .",
    "an example of skyline and sky background subtraction is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 . last , galaxy continuum or , more generally , all the uniform structure parallel to the dispersion axis ( stars on major axis ) must also be removed .",
    "this operation is useful for a closer interactive determination of the galaxian center where continuum and emission lines intersect . to do this carefully ( especially around the emission complex ) , we shifted the data by the inverse of a coarse ( integer ) model of the rotation curve so that the galaxy emission lines all become straight ( to within a fraction of a pixel ) .",
    "the background was fitted row - by - row and subtracted from the data .",
    "the images were then shifted back to recover their exact pre - subtraction configuration ( see fig .",
    "integral shifts ensure that no spectrum degradation was introduced .",
    "finally , a noise - variance was constructed for each galaxy spectrum to allow the measurement of velocity errors ( c92 ) .",
    "we measured the intensity - weighted centroids at each row along the galaxy emission using a parabolic - binned interpolation ( see appendix c ) .",
    "this technique makes no assumption about the profile shape and as such , yields both a robust center and error estimate .",
    "the signal - to - noise threshold was chosen to represent an error of a third of a pixel in the determination of the centroid .",
    "this corresponds roughly to s / n@xmath37 or a velocity error greater than 16  at lick and 25  at las campanas .",
    "the final set of cf orcs is shown in appendix a. figure 4 shows the distribution of the maximal extent of orcs scaled by the disk exponential scale length @xmath38 .",
    "we now compare our results with the series of photographic orcs by rubin and coworkers ( rubin 1985 , and references therein ) .",
    "rubin s sample does not probe the extragalactic volume as deeply as ours and includes earlier types .",
    "consequently , the overlap between our samples is limited to 8 galaxies , as shown on fig .",
    "5 . rubin s smoothed two - sided rcs ( represented by open squares ) were scanned and digitized from old paper tracings kindly provided to us by vera rubin .",
    "our data ( filled circles ) are not smoothed and hence display larger fluctuations .",
    "most detections ( and non - detections ) and overall shape variations are well matched .",
    "our rcs for u1550 and u5250 are slightly shallower but this is explained by a shorter exposure time than normal .",
    "good agreement is also found with 3 galaxies from mat s collection , as seen in fig .",
    ". the thesis sample of vogt ( 1994 ) offers a more substantial overlap .",
    "this is shown in figs .",
    "vogt s sample , observed with the palomar 5 m , was designed to probe the fainter ends of rcs to study environmental effects in clusters .",
    "longer integration times and the aperture ratio both account for greater s / n in vogt s data . in most cases though , the physical extent and broad features between vogt s data and ours compare favorably .",
    "typically , detection of nebular  emission via long - slit spectroscopy is limited to a common isophotal radius ( see fig .",
    "4 ) for nominal tf exposures times ( @xmath39s on 5-m class telescopes ) . the 23 rcs shown in fig .",
    "7a , b are reasonably smooth and show little deviation from circular motions .",
    "vogt s data show kinematic `` twists '' for u1437 and u12631 which are not confirmed by our data ( nor are they challenged either ; here , comparisons suffer from non - detections . )",
    "fabry - perot ( fp ) spectroscopy offers significant advantages over conventional long - slit spectroscopy for the extraction of optical rcs ( schommer 1993 ) .",
    "first , the velocity field is fully mapped spatially .",
    "this yields greater s /",
    "n in the outer regions and provides a more robust measure of the galaxian circular velocity .",
    "second , deprojection of the velocities uses kinematical information directly instead of photometric inclinations for long - slit data which may not be adequate ( schommer 1993 ) .",
    "comparison with the fp data of amram ( 1992 , 1994 ) is nonetheless quite satisfactory on large scales ( fig .",
    "the fp profiles ( open squares ) consist of a smooth rotation curve projected on the plane of the sky .",
    "they extend much farther out and show less small scale noise than our major - axis cuts ( filled circles ) .",
    "the localized perturbations on the major axis are attributable to spiral arms and non - circular motions .",
    "still , we tested that linewidth measurements from smooth fits of long - slit rcs are in close agreement with similar linewidths from fp orcs .",
    "fp data cubes require a few hours of on / off integrations on large telescopes ( @xmath40-m ) which makes any fp investigation of a large sample of galaxies logistically challenging .",
    "while we recognize the merits of fp data over long - slit spectra , it is believed that the latter can still provide sufficient s / n and sampling to measure the most representative value of circular velocity for the galaxy .",
    "before we derive various measures of rotation velocities from orcs , it is worth considering different parameterizations or models which might best describe their shape .",
    "a disadvantage of this approach is that _ a priori _ assumptions about the shape of the rc must be made .",
    "the major advantage is that all points ( and their errors ) are used simultaneously and systematic deviations in defining a robust linewidth measure are likely to be reduced .",
    "we will see below that `` model '' linewidths prove to be most reliable .",
    "_ physical _ modelling of rcs is not a simple affair since it requires a complete description of the contributions from the bulge , disk , and ( bright and dark ) halo components to the overall galaxy dynamics .",
    "such global models have been proposed , first with the keplerian formulation of brandt ( 1960 , and references therein ) and culminating recently in the `` universal rotation curve '' ( urc ) of disk galaxies by pss which accounts for luminous and dark matter .",
    "one wishes to adopt a parameterization which most naturally espouses the shape of each rc , with no pretense of having a physical basis , yet with the least number of free parameters .",
    "use of a smooth rotation curve model will allow for the measurement of specific rotational speeds ( metric , isophotal , etc . ) and , in principle , extrapolation of the original data if they do not extend beyond a certain fiducial radius .",
    "three models were tested : 1 ) a basic 2-parameter @xmath41 function , 2 ) a more elaborate _",
    "ad - hoc _ fitting function , and 3 ) , the `` urc '' parameterization of pss .",
    "models 1 and 2 were fitted using a levenberg - marquardt technique .",
    "application of model 3 only required input of 2 variables , the absolute luminosity and the optical radius of the galaxy .",
    "the models were applied to both cf and mat orcs ( projected on the plane of the sky . )",
    "the fits for all observed cf spectra are reported in appendix a ( on top of the actual data ) , and the fit coefficients for both cf and mat data are given in appendix b. plots and models for mat s data are available from the author upon request .",
    "it is useful to gauge galaxy sizes in terms of an optical radius and we adopt below the definition of pss for a pure exponential galaxy : @xmath42 , where @xmath38 is the disk exponential scalelength ( paper i ) . more generally , @xmath43 is defined as that radius which encloses 83% of the total light .",
    "it is closely equivalent to the isophotal radius at 24 @xmath0-mag / arcsec@xmath44 , @xmath45 ( paper i ) .",
    "we also write @xmath46 .",
    "* model 1 .",
    "the arctan function *    the normalized @xmath41 rc fitting function is given by : @xmath47",
    "where @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the velocity center of rotation , @xmath50 is the spatial center of the galaxy , @xmath51 is an asymptotic velocity , and @xmath52 is a transition radius between the rising and flat part of the rc .",
    "this function reproduces the shape of rcs reasonably well with the smallest number of arguments .",
    "moreover , it emerges naturally from the standard parameterization of dark halo density profiles ( gilmore , king , & van der kruit 1990 , p.212 ) .",
    "the arctan model is shown in fig . 9 for various values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "arctan fits for all galaxies are plotted in appendix a as long - dashed curves on the folded rcs .",
    "the curves are often hidden under the continuous line which describes model 2 below .",
    "the arctan model provides an adequate match to most rcs , does not account for any sharp peak near the turnover radius ( u3181 , u7337 , u8161 ) .",

    "the universal rotation curve ( urc ) *    the `` universal '' parameterization of pss has recently been used as a tool to model tf velocities ( g97 ) .",
    "pss s physical model was designed to account broadly for the contribution of the luminous and dark matter to the overall rc . in its current form",
    ", luminous matter is modelled from the contribution of a stellar exponential thin disk and the dark matter halo is expressed as an isothermal sphere . the dark component",
    "is scaled by assuming a maximum ( luminous ) disk .",
    "this parameterization implies that all the families of rc shapes can be characterized by luminosity alone .",
    "the urc uses two variables as input : @xmath17 , the absolute blue luminosity of the galaxy - band subscript for consistency with the pss notation . ] , as the shape parameter and the optical radius @xmath43 for normalization at @xmath71 .",
    "equation 14 of pss is written as : @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "we use @xmath74 , @xmath75 , in concordance with pss , or @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "the offset between this and pss s value will cause model departures at the 2 - 3% level . ] .",
    "since derivation of the galaxy luminosity is the final product of the tf machinery , using a luminosity - dependent formula for tf applications , such as that of pss , requires an iterative procedure to solve for the final metric .",
    "we allow ourselves to violate this argument by using measured @xmath78 from the rc3 for the sake of verification .",
    "color transformations to convert available @xmath0-band luminosities ( paper i ) to the @xmath10-band are avoided to minimize errors .",
    "urc models are only computed if both @xmath0-band and @xmath10-band luminosities are available . moreover , these models can only be computed if surface photometry exists to estimate @xmath43 , either directly or from the scale length for pure disk galaxies .",
    "photometry must also extend beyond @xmath43 ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the subjectivity in choosing proper scale lengths or applying an exact fraction ( 83% ) of the `` total '' light to measure @xmath43 provides an additional source of uncertainty for those models .",
    "besides being model dependent , @xmath43 increases with wavelength due to extinction effects ( burstein , willick , & courteau 1994 ) .",
    "care must thus be taken when applying the urc in different wavelength regimes .",
    "we make no compensation for dust effects at this point .",
    "urc models were computed for 131 galaxies and are compared to the data in appendix a ; these are represented with a dotted curve .",
    "a visual classification scheme suffices to assess the goodness of fit ; 70 models were rated `` good '' , 21 `` marginal '' , and 40 were labelled `` poor '' .",
    "this degree of success ( @xmath80 ) is perhaps satisfactory for broad galaxy formation and scaling issues but is less adequate for accurate modelling and tf applications ( as has been recognized by pss ) .",
    "the urc fails most conspicuously for rapidly rising curves and seems to predict too strong a decline in the outer regions . in the bulge region ,",
    "the pss model has a tendency to overshoot a slow solid - body rise and underestimate any fast rise .",
    "this is readily understood by the absence of a bulge term in the urc formulation . while central regions of late - type systems may be small and faint ( courteau ,",
    "de  jong , & broeils 1996 ) , their contribution to the gravitational potential is non - negligible ( broeils & courteau 1998 ) .",
    "furthermore , the circular complication involved in using luminosities as input in the urc formula prevents any direct tf application .",
    "issues involving the choice of blue luminosities ( which are strongly affected by dust ) , a wavelength- and model - dependent definition ( isophotal radii or scalelengths ) , adjustment of internal constants ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) , and revision of the distribution of light to include a bulge component , all need to be addressed in a more comprehensive analysis . in its present form , the urc should not be used for exact modelling .",
    "extrapolation of the urc to estimate @xmath71 for shallow rcs is equally admonished in light of the potentially large data - model differences in the outer parts ( appendix a ) .",
    "in what follows , we adopt model 2 as the best parameterization to describe orc shapes for the tf work .",
    "model 1 may prove more useful for structural analyses .",
    "the tf relation is based in part on an estimate of the `` intrinsic '' rotational speed , or linewidth , of a disk galaxy which is measured beyond the central rise of the rc .",
    "the definition of linewidth varies from author to author .",
    "linewidth measurements with respect to peak levels of the 21-cm `` horned '' profile were initially favored for computational simplicity .",
    "however , peak intensities are affected by sampling and binning effects .",
    "modern linewidth measurements are based on robust quantities such as integrated flux or mean intensity ( bicay and giovanelli 1986 ) or the slope of the profile edges ( bottinelli 1983 ) .    since",
    "hi linewidths have defined the standard for most tf calibrations to date , it is appropriate to seek a new definition of optical rotation which will _ best reproduce 21 cm results_. this new optical linewidth should also meet two basic requirements : _ best internal scatter _ ( robust to observational errors ) and _ minimization of tf residuals . _",
    "a similar search was undertaken by raychaudhuri ( 1997 ) but their small sample as well as the lack of repeat observations prevented them from discriminating among their various linewidth measures .",
    "they were able to confirm that orcs yield as small a tf scatter as linewidths ( see  11 ) .",
    "the measurement of linewidths from resolved rcs is advantageous since emission line centroids are not affected by internal and instrumental broadening .",
    "however , with increasing distance , seeing effects become important and the shape of rcs can be significantly altered near the center ( vogt 1996 ) . at higher redshifts ( @xmath83 ) , the velocity field of a distant galaxy",
    "may completely fill the entrance aperture of either long - slit spectrographs or integral field units .",
    "it is thus important to keep track of calibrations based on integrated rotation profiles as well as resolved rcs to allow a bridge between tf calibrations at low and high redshifts .",
    "various measures to estimate the maximum rotational speed from an asymmetric and noisy rotation curve are investigated below .",
    "those based on only a few velocity points are expected to reproduce rather poorly .",
    "c92 tested 3 linewidth measurements , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , based on the 1st , 2nd , and 3rd highest velocity points on each side of the rc .",
    "an average of these , @xmath87 , was also computed ( see  7 ) .      a less susceptible approach consists of taking the weighted mean of all the velocity points where the rc levels off .",
    "we do this by summing 20% of all the velocity points from the far - end of the orc on each side . for a fast rotator ,",
    "this is equivalent to drawing a line through the points on the rotation plateaus .",
    "the mean of the summations on both sides is @xmath88 .",
    "r97 describe this method in their  4.3 .",
    "this technique suffers mostly from an ill - defined interior boundary of integration .",
    "the weighted - mean method most closely matches the eye - ball technique of mat to fit optical line widths .",
    "the subjective nature of this method makes duplication and testing of mat s results virtually impossible .",
    "we define more objective and stable measures of tf velocity based on the orc parameterization ( model 2 ) in conjunction with , in some cases , photometric parameters .",
    "four measurements were examined : i ) @xmath89 , the peak velocity of the model , ii ) @xmath1 , the velocity interpolated at @xmath90 disk scale lengths which corresponds to the location of peak rotational amplitude for a pure exponential disk ( freeman 1970 , binney & tremaine 1987 , courteau & rix 1997 ) , iii ) @xmath71 , the velocity measured at @xmath43 , and iv ) @xmath91 , an `` isophotal '' velocity inferred at the 23 mag / arcsec@xmath44 isophotal level ( paper i ) .",
    "we now explore alternative linewidths from integrated profile which resemble single - dish 21 cm spectra .",
    "this is done by adding all the velocity points which define the orc along the spatial axis of the galaxy .",
    "the motivations for studying this technique are twofold : 1 ) its principles are based upon a well - proven method ( radio linewidths ) , and 2 ) a calibration ( intensity - weighted ) will be necessary for investigations of unresolved rotation profiles from high - redshift galaxies ( courteau , sohn , & faber 1998 ) .",
    "the most important benefit of histogram measurements is the increase in linewidth s / n since _ all _ the velocity points are used in the computation .",
    "two velocity histograms are of potential interest : the _ un - weighted _ and _ intensity - weighted _ cases . the major weakness of _ intensity - weighted _",
    "profiles is that a flux integral will favor the brightest regions ( schommer 1993 , r97 ) .",
    "this effect is still sufficiently mild in normal spirals ( non - starbust , liners , or seyfert galaxies ) that a tf calibration can still be defined ( c92 and below ) .",
    "_ un - weighted _ velocity histograms alleviate this shortcoming entirely .",
    "one can sort all the velocity data points ( which obey the minimum s / n criterion ) and calculate the difference , @xmath92 , between the @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( interpolated ) percentile points in the ranked distribution of velocities .",
    "this technique , first used by dressler & faber ( 1990 ) and further developed by vogt ( 1994 ) , is similar to constructing an unweighted velocity histogram and measuring the width at 10% of total area on each side of the profile .",
    "a variant of this technique called the `` probable min - max '' ( pmm ) method by r97 ( see their  4.6 ) , considers the probability distribution of all velocity points with their gaussian errors .",
    "a velocity @xmath95 is computed from the difference of the 90% probable maximum and minimum from both sides of the rc .",
    "this method is however sensitive to broadening effects which are reflected in the velocity error at each point .",
    "we explored three flux - weighted linewidth measurements : @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
    "the area under each profile is measured by integrating along the velocity axis ; fractional flux levels are computed via parabolic - binned interpolation ( see appendix c ) .",
    "we define a velocity linewidth , @xmath21 , as the difference between those velocities where the integration reaches a predefined percentage of the total area , 10% and 90% for @xmath97 .",
    "definitions relative to peak intensities are avoided since the detailed shape of the profile is sensitive to spectral resolution and , for orcs , to the individual fluxes of  regions lying on the slit .",
    "while the exact shape of the profile is not a conserved quantity , its area or total flux , should be .",
    "13 shows the locations of these width markers for ugc1437 .",
    "these are measured quite high compared to 21 cm profiles ( roberts 1978 , bicay & giovanelli 1986 ) .",
    "a discussion of this choice of optical linewidths and systematic effects will be given in courteau , sohn , & faber ( 1998 ) .",
    "we consider one last measure of integrated linewidth , @xmath99 , the separation between the velocity points where the intensity reaches 50% of the mean flux over the full velocity range of detectable signal .",
    "this is analogous to 21 cm linewidths defined at 50% of the total mean .",
    "rotation profiles for each galaxy were not presented for space considerations but are available at request from the author .      for future use",
    ", we also compute the logarithmic slope , @xmath100 , from the folded deprojected data in the rest - frame of the galaxy .",
    "measurement of logslopes from sparse data is exceedingly sensitive to noise and we use a bootstrapping technique to infer their mean and error .",
    "the mean logslope of the observed data , @xmath101 , is computed between @xmath102 and the last measured velocity point .",
    "we also compute an analogous quantity , @xmath103 , from model 2 .",
    "these are given in table 13 .",
    "14 displays the distribution of logslopes , @xmath101 and @xmath103 , for all cf galaxies .",
    "about 4% of the sample exhibits declining outer slopes and @xmath18 60% of all rcs have achieved convergence , @xmath104 .",
    "this fraction of convergent profiles is lower than the 81% found by schlegel ( 1995 ) for a sample of 282 nearby iras - selected galaxies .",
    "none of schlegel s rcs exhibit negative logslopes either .",
    "this high rate of convergence of iras - selected galaxies , if true , is surprising since the tf scatter for these galaxies was found to be higher than for optically - selected spirals ( schlegel 1995 ) .",
    "one would expect that better behaved linewidths ( more convergent profiles ) would yield reduced tf scatter .",
    "massive star formation activity characteristic of iras galaxies could however bias the luminosity high and explain schlegel s observations .",
    "van  driel ( 1995 ) also studied tf differences between optically - selected and iras galaxies but did not find striking discrepancies .",
    "further investigations of iras - galaxies would be desirable , especially if their rcs are systematically flatter than orcs as indicated by their logslopes .",
    "we have measured repeatability errors from multiple observations of 62 galaxies , for a total of 132 independent observations .",
    "these are all reported in appendix a. unweighted standard deviations , @xmath105 , in   are given in table 2 below for the various linewidth measures .",
    "these refer to the one - sided value of the rotational velocities ( @xmath106 )    not surprisingly , all measures of linewidth based on one or a few velocity points fare rather poorly .",

    "we contend for now that our _ model _ linewidths @xmath1 and @xmath91 provide the closest match to the linewidths of g97 .",
    "the tight and constant scatter at all luminosities between ( suitably chosen ) optical / radio linewidths ( c92 , mat , vogt 1994 ) may appear surprising given that resolved rcs extend far beyond the optical radius .",

    "as seen in panels b ) and c ) ( most appropriate for comparison with typical tf galaxies ) , many rcs keep rising beyond @xmath43 . perusal of appendix a ( see also mat , rubin 1989 ) also shows many orcs which have not reached any turnover by the last point of detection ( see also fig .",
    "it is often assumed that optical linewidths should be biased _ low _ in comparison to radio data , especially in low mass systems .",
    "however , unlike resolved rcs , linewidths _ do not _ sample outer disks effectively since the surface density drops rapidly beyond the optical radius ( cayatte 1994 , broeils & van woerden 1994 , broeils & rhee 1997 ) .",
    "the amount of inside @xmath43 is typically greater than @xmath170% of the total .",
    "this holds true for the majority of spiral types ( cayatte 1994 , roberts & haynes 1994 ) .",
    "linewidths are thus weighted heavily by the flux inside the optical radius .",
    "hence , it is not surprising that optical resolved velocity widths and integrated linewidths should match so well . for low and intermediate mass galaxies ( fig .",
    "16a , b ) , the profile width may therefore be less than twice the true maximum velocity .",
    "modelling the interplay between the shape of the rotation curve , the surface density , and the width of the global profile is an important task .",
    "the correlation between 21 cm linewidths and the true maximum rotational velocity of spiral galaxies , often assumed to be unity but surely smaller , would be of great benefit for dynamical studies .",
    "exploratory investigations are being conducted ( schulman 1997 ) but a clear picture is still lacking .    a significant fraction ( 30% ) of disk galaxies also reach their peak velocity close to the optical radius which reinforces the tight optical / radio linewidth correlation .",
    "17 shows the distributions of peak rotational velocities from the ( resolved ) optical and rcs of cf and broeils ( 1992 ) respectively .",
    "the open circles represent only those galaxies in cf that have achieved convergence (  6.3 ) and broeils galaxies are shown as filled circles labelled with their catalog name .",
    "the solid line represents a transition between hsb and dwarf galaxies . above that line ,",
    "most of the galaxies show a turnover near @xmath171 which is just within the limits of optical detection by conventional long - slit spectrographs .",
    "we have presented a new collection of optical rcs for 304 late - type spirals , here referred to as the courteau - faber ( cf ) sample .",
    "the first sections of this paper discussed data reduction procedures and extraction of rcs from resolved  spectra .",
    "our rotation curves were shown to be in excellent agreement with similar data taken by different authors with different telescopes ( amram , mathewson , rubin , and vogt ) .",
    "an empirical function was adopted to model the shape , amplitude , and zero - point ( radial velocity ) of each orc , and then used to infer stable linewidths for tf applications .",
    "an additional fitting parameter was sometimes included to account for rising or declining rcs beyond the optical radius .",
    "strong covariances are unavoidable in this multi - parameter modelling . a two - parameter prescription , like the arctan function , is required to minimize internal coupling between the fitted parameters .",
    "we also modelled 958 rcs from the collection of mathewson ( 1992 ) using the same fitting functions .",
    "we pointed out that the `` universal rotation curve '' of persic , salucci , & stel ( 1996 ) is not a perfect tracer of fast rising bulges and declining outer disks .",
    "this shortfall of the model may soon be remedied by accounting at least for a bulge component ( salucci 1997 , private communication ) .",
    "because of matching uncertainties at large radii , use of the urc model is not recommended to extrapolate isophotal tf linewidths . the model - dependency of the urc via @xmath43 and metric requirement to define @xmath78 are additional sources of ambivalence",
    ".            the best linewidths are those determined via multi - parameter fitting .",
    "modelling smooths out all effects of non - circular motions which are particularly acute in long - slit data .",
    "internal repeatability is thus maximized .",
    "the best measure of tf velocity is @xmath1 , the location of peak rotational velocity for a pure exponential disk .",
    "@xmath1 is interpolated from the _ model _ rotation curve at @xmath173 , where @xmath38 is the disk exponential scalelength . )",
    "this definition ranked with the best in all three categories above .",
    "the distinction of yielding smallest residuals in tf diagrams is shared by essentially any _ isophotal _ linewidths ( here , @xmath91 and @xmath71 ) .",
    "it is possible to define an optical rotational velocity for tf use which is an identical match to radio linewidths .",
    "we showed that @xmath1 provides such a match for @xmath168 , the radio linewidth measured at 50% of peak intensity by g97 .",
    "the good agreement between optical and radio linewidths is understood because a large fraction ( 50 - 60% ) of the surface density is actually contained within the optical radius , and , in addition , a significant fraction ( 30% ) of orcs also reach their peak velocity before @xmath43 .",
    "finally , tf calibrations based solely on optical linewidths can yield as robust and accurate measures of tf distances as analyses based on linewidths , provided the choice of optical linewidth is made judiciously .",

    "<S> we present optical long - slit rotation curves ( rcs ) for 304 northern sb - sc ugc galaxies originally selected for tully - fisher ( tf ) applications . matching @xmath0-band photometry exists for each galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the procedures of rc extraction and construction of optical profiles analogous to 21 cm integrated linewidths . </S>",
    "<S> more than 20% of the galaxies were observed twice or more , allowing for a proper determination of systematic errors . </S>",
    "<S> various measures of maximum rotational velocity to be used as input in the tf relation are tested on the basis of their repeatability , minimization of tf scatter , and match with 21 cm linewidths . </S>",
    "<S> the best measure of tf velocity , @xmath1 , is given at the location of peak rotational velocity of a pure exponential disk . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative measure to @xmath1 which makes no assumption about the luminosity profile or shape of the rotation curve is @xmath2 , the 20% width of the velocity histogram , though the match with 21 cm linewidths is not as good . we show that optical tf calibrations yield internal scatter comparable to , if not smaller than , the best calibrations based on single - dish 21 cm radio linewidths . even though resolved rcs are more extended than their optical counterpart , a tight match between optical and radio linewidths exists since the bulk of the surface density is enclosed within the optical radius .    </S>",
    "<S> we model the 304 rcs presented here and a sample of 958 curves from mathewson ( 1992 ) with various fitting functions . </S>",
    "<S> an arctan function provides an adequate simple fit ( not accounting for non - circular motions and spiral arms ) . </S>",
    "<S> more elaborate , empirical models may yield a better match at the expense of strong covariances . </S>",
    "<S> we caution against physical or `` universal '' parameterizations for tf applications .    </S>",
