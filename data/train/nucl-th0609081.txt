    "both at sub - saturation and supra - saturation densities , predictions based of the existing many - body techniques diverge rather widely , see @xcite . we take advantage of new opportunities in theory ( development of rather reliable microscopic transport codes for @xmath0 ) and in experiments ( availability of very asymmetric radioactive beams , improved possibility of measuring event - by - event correlations ) to present results that are severely constraining the existing effective interaction models .",

    "this can lead to 3-body breakings , where a light cluster is emitted from the neck region .",
    "three body processes in collisions with exotic beams will allow to investigate how the development of surface ( neck - like ) instabilities , that would help ternary breakings , is sensitive to the structure of the symmetry term around ( below ) saturation . in order to suggest proposals for the new @xmath7 facility @xmath8 , @xcite we have studied the reaction @xmath9 at @xmath10 in semicentral events , impact parameters @xmath11 , where one observes mostly binary exit channels , but still in presence of large dissipation .",
    "two different behaviors of the symmetry energy below saturation have been tested : one ( @xmath12 ) where it is a smooth decreasing function towards low densities , and another one ( @xmath13 ) where we have a rapid decrease , @xcite .",
    "the wilczynski plots , kinetic energy loss vs. deflection angle , show slightly more dissipative events in the @xmath13 case , consistent with the point that in the interaction at lower densities in very neutron - rich matter ( the neck region ) we have a less repulsive symmetry term .",
    "in fact the neck dynamics is rather different in the two cases , as it can be well evidenced looking at the deformation of the @xmath14 residues .",

    "we can predict interesting isospin transport effects for this new fragmentation mechanism since clusters are formed still in a dilute asymmetric matter but always in contact with the regions of the projectile - like and target - like remnants almost at normal densities . since the difference between local neutron - proton chemical potentials is given by @xmath22",

    "the collision term includes elastic and inelastic processes involving the production / absorption of the @xmath64 and @xmath65 resonances as well as their decays into pion channels , @xcite . a larger repulsive vector contribution to the neutron energies",
    "is given by the @xmath55-coupling .",
    "this is rapidly increasing with density when the @xmath56 field is included @xcite . as a consequence we expect a good sensitivity to the covariant structure of the isovector fields in nucleon emission and particle production data .",
    "moreover the presence of a _ lorentz magnetic _ term in the relativistic transport equation @xcite will enhance the dynamical effects of vector fields @xcite .",
    "differential flows will be directly affected .",
    "-1.3 cm [ flows ]    in fig.[flows ] transverse and elliptic differential flows are shown for the @xmath66 reaction at @xmath67 ( @xmath16 ) , @xcite .",
    "the effect of the different structure of the isovector channel is clear .",
    "particularly evident is the splitting in the high @xmath68 region of the elliptic flow . in the @xmath69 dynamics",
    "the high-@xmath68 neutrons show a much larger @xmath70 .",
    "this is fully consistent with an early emission ( more spectator shadowing ) due to the larger @xmath55-field in the compression stage .",
    "kaon production has been proven to be a reliable observable for the high density @xmath1 in the isoscalar sector @xcite here we show that the @xmath71 production ( in particular the @xmath72 yield ratio ) can be also used to probe the isovector part of the @xmath1 .    using our @xmath73 transport approach we analyze pion and kaon production in central @xmath38 collisions in the @xmath74 beam energy range , comparing models giving the same `` soft '' @xmath1 for symmetric matter and with different effective field choices for @xmath3 @xcite . here",
    "we also use a lagrangian with density dependent couplings ( @xmath75 , @xcite ) , recently suggested for better nucleonic properties of neutron stars @xcite . in the @xmath75 model the @xmath55-coupling is exponentially decreasing with density , resulting in a rather `` soft '' symmetry term at high density .",
    "the hadron mean field propagation , which goes beyond the `` collision cascade '' picture , is essential for particle production yields : in particular the isospin dependence of the self - energies directly affects the energy balance of the inelastic channels .",

[ kaon1 ]",
    "we see that the pion results are weakly dependent on the isospin part of the nuclear mean field .",
    "however , a slight increase ( decrease ) in the @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) multiplicity is observed when going from the @xmath62 ( or @xmath75 ) to the @xmath60 and then to the @xmath61 model , i.e. increasing the vector contribution @xmath84 in the isovector channel .",
    "this trend is more pronounced for kaons , see the right panel , due to the high density selection of the source and the proximity to the production threshold .",
    "when isovector fields are included the symmetry potential energy in neutron - rich matter is repulsive for neutrons and attractive for protons . in a @xmath0",
    "this leads to a fast , pre - equilibrium , emission of neutrons .",
    "such a @xmath85 mechanism , often referred to as isospin fractionation @xcite , is responsible for a reduction of the neutron to proton ratio during the high density phase , with direct consequences on particle production in inelastic @xmath86 collisions .",
    "@xmath87 effects represent a more subtle point .",
    "the energy conservation in a hadron collision is expressed in terms of the canonical momenta , i.e. for a reaction @xmath88 as @xmath89 since hadrons are propagating with effective ( kinetic ) momenta and masses , an equivalent relation should be formulated starting from the effective in - medium quantities @xmath90 and @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the scalar and vector self - energies .",
    "the self - energy contributions will influence the particle production at the level of thresholds as well as of the phase space available in the final channel . in neutron - rich colliding systems _",
    "mean field _ and _ threshold _ effects are acting in opposite directions . at low energies , around the production threshold , , the energy conservation ( i.e. the self energy contributions ) is dominant , as we see from fig .",
    "[ kaon1 ] , in particular for kaons .",
    "we have to note that in a previous study of kaon production in excited nuclear matter the dependence of the @xmath94 yield ratio on the effective isovector interaction appears much larger ( see fig.8 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the point is that in the non - equilibrium case of a heavy ion collision the asymmetry of the source where kaons are produced is in fact reduced by the @xmath95 `` transformation '' , due to the favored @xmath96 processes .",
    "this effect is almost absent at equilibrium due to the inverse transitions .",
    "moreover in infinite nuclear matter even the fast neutron emission is not present .",
    "this result clearly shows that chemical equilibrium models can lead to uncorrect results when used for transient states of an @xmath97 system .",
    "the hadronic matter is expected to undergo a phase transition into a deconfined phase of quarks and gluons at large densities and/or high temperatures .",
    "on very general grounds , the transition critical densities are expected to depend on the isospin of the system , but no experimental tests of this dependence have been performed so far . in order to check the possibility of observing some precursor signals of some new physics even in collisions of stable nuclei at intermediate energies we have performed some event simulations for the collision of very heavy , neutron - rich , elements .",
    "we have chosen the reaction @xmath98 ( average proton fraction @xmath99 ) at @xmath100 and semicentral impact parameter @xmath101 just to increase the neutron excess in the interacting region .",
    "after about @xmath102 in the overlap region a nice local equilibration is achieved .",
    "a rather exotic nuclear matter is formed in a transient time of the order of @xmath102 , with baryon density around @xmath103 , temperature @xmath104 , energy density @xmath105 and proton fraction between @xmath106 and @xmath107 , likely inside the estimated mixed phase region @xcite .",
    "we can study the isospin dependence of the transition densities @xcite in a systematic way .",
    "concerning the hadronic phase , we use the relativistic non - linear model of glendenning - moszkowski ( in particular the `` soft '' @xmath108 choice ) @xcite , where the isovector part is treated just with @xmath55 meson coupling , and the iso - stiffer @xmath61 interaction @xcite .",
    "for the quark phase we consider the @xmath109 bag model with various bag pressure constants .",
    "in particular we are interested in those parameter sets which would allow the existence of quark stars @xcite , i.e. parameter sets for which the so - called witten - bodmer hypothesis is satisfied @xcite .",
    "one of the aim of our work it to show that if quark stars are indeed possible , it is then very likely to find signals of the formation of a mixed quark - hadron phase in intermediate - energy heavy - ion experiments @xcite .",
    "the structure of the mixed phase is obtained by imposing the gibbs conditions @xcite for chemical potentials and pressure and by requiring the conservation of the total baryon and isospin densities @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the fraction of quark matter in the mixed phase . in this way",
    "we get the @xmath112 surface which gives the phase coexistence region in the @xmath113 space @xcite . for a fixed value of the conserved charge @xmath114 we will study the boundaries of the mixed phase region in the @xmath115 plane . in the hadronic phase the charge chemical potential",
    "is given by @xmath116 thus , we expect critical densities rather sensitive to the isovector channel in the hadronic @xmath1 .    in fig .",

    "region during the collision of the n - rich @xmath121sn+@xmath121sn system , at different energies . at @xmath122",
    "we are just reaching the border of the mixed phase , and we are well inside it at @xmath100 .",
    "-1.3 cm [ rhodelta ]    statistical fluctuations could help in reducing the density at which drops of quark matter form .",
    "the reason is that a small bubble can be energetically favored if it contains quarks whose z / a ratio is _ smaller _ than the average value of the surrounding region @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a _ neutron trapping _ effect , supported also by a symmetry energy difference in the two phases . in fact while in the hadron phase we have a large neutron potential repulsion ( in particular in the @xmath61 case ) , in the quark phase we only have the much smaller kinetic contribution .",
    "if in a pure hadronic phase neutrons are quickly emitted or `` transformed '' in protons by inelastic collisions , when the mixed phase starts forming , neutrons are kept in the interacting system up to the subsequent hadronization in the expansion stage @xcite .",
    "observables related to such neutron `` trapping '' could be an inversion in the trend of the formation of neutron rich fragments and/or of the @xmath123 , @xmath72 yield ratios for reaction products coming from high density regions , i.e. with large transverse momenta .",
    "we have shown that _ violent _ collisions of n - rich heavy ions from low to relativistic energies can bring new information on the isovector part of the in - medium interaction , qualitatively different from equilibrium @xmath1 properties .",
    "we have presented quantitative results in a wide range of beam energies . at low energies we have shown isospin effects on the dissipation in deep inelastic collisions , at fermi energies the iso - eos sensitivity of the isospin transport in fragment reactions and finally at intermediate the dependence of differential flows on the @xmath29 and effective mass splitting . in relativistic collisions",
    "we have shown the possibility of a direct @xmath124 of the lorentz structure of the isovector fields at high baryon density , from differential collective flows and yields of charged pion and kaon ratios .",
    "important non - equilibrium effects for particle production are stressed .",
    "finally our study supports the possibility of observing precursor signals of the phase transition to a mixed hadron - quark matter at high baryon density in the collision , central or semi - central , of neutron - rich heavy ions in the energy range of a few @xmath2 . as signatures we suggest to look at the isospin structure of hadrons produced at high transverse momentum , as a good indicator of the neutron trapping effect . in conclusion",
