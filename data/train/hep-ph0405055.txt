    "a major goal for the fermilab tevatron and the cern lhc is the detailed study of the properties of the top quark . in particular they should establish whether the third family behaves like the first two , or whether it is subject to new interactions . the interactions of the third family have been studied indirectly in many low energy processes such as rare kaon and b meson decays with no firm evidence for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "there are , however , certain inconsistencies @xcite associated with the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath1 measured at lep that hint at a potential problem . in any case it is highly desirable to pursue a direct study of the couplings of the top quark in colliders . with this in mind , and motivated by the possibility that the top quark plays a special role in the breaking of electroweak symmetry @xcite , we have previously studied the signals for a new resonance in the process @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a different type of signal occurs if the new resonances couple strongly to the third generation of quarks but not necessarily to the @xmath3 and @xmath4 gauge bosons . in this paper",
    "we study the signatures for this type of new physics at the tevatron and at the lhc .",
    "we first discuss the cases of a vector and a scalar resonance ( generically denoted by @xmath5 ) produced in the @xmath6-channel processes @xmath7 . in these processes",
    "the qcd backgrounds are large and we apply known techniques to reduce these backgrounds .",
    "we then consider the production of the new resonances in association with a @xmath8 or @xmath9 pair through processes such as @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "these processes are higher order corrections to the @xmath6-channel production and therefore have a significantly smaller cross - section .",
    "however , their unique topology permits a much better control of the qcd background and we find that they yield potentially observable signals .",
    "in our study of the process @xmath2 @xcite we used model - independent ( but non - renormalizable ) parameterizations for the couplings of the new resonances to the @xmath12 and @xmath13 quarks .",
    "we found that if these resonances were responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking they were typically very broad when they were as heavy as a few tev . in order to parametrize new resonances that are heavy and narrow we argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that we had to consider models with more than one new resonance at a time . in this paper",
    "we adopt this scenario and do not require that our resonances be responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we say nothing of their couplings to @xmath3 and @xmath4 gauge bosons but simply assume that they provide negligible contributions to their widths .",
    "a prototype for a vector resonance with such behavior : no coupling to the @xmath3 and @xmath4 gauge bosons ; very weak coupling to the first two generations of fermions ; and large coupling to @xmath12 and @xmath13 quarks is provided by the @xmath14 from ref .  @xcite . for definiteness we will have this particle in mind as our vector resonance .",
    "we can regard this as a fairly general parametrization of a new vector resonance with arbitrary couplings to @xmath12 and @xmath13 if we abandon renormalizability and treat the resonance couplings as an effective theory , in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite . for the case of a scalar resonance",
    "we use the simple parameterization of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 couplings that we used in ref .",
    "@xcite but we assume a negligible width @xmath17 . the possibility of non - standard couplings for the top quark has been discussed extensively in the literature in the context of anomalous couplings @xcite .",
    "some generic models of vector resonances coupled to the top quark strongly are studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . by adding new resonances as explicit degrees of freedom to the effective theory ,",
    "one is able to study potential non - standard couplings in a larger energy domain .",
    "we begin by discussing our parametrization for the new vector resonance .",
    "effective interactions between the sm gauge bosons and fermions and new vector resonances have been described in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in new interactions of @xmath12 and @xmath13 quarks to new heavy resonances that are sufficiently narrow to be described by a breit - wigner shape .",
    "one way to accomplish this within the effective lagrangian framework is to have more than one resonance as we discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we assume that this is the case , and that the resonance under study has negligible couplings to electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "an alternative way to obtain such a resonance is to consider extended gauge sectors .",
    "our goal in this paper is to investigate the extent to which hadron colliders are sensitive to new strong interactions of the top quark regardless of the origin of the new interactions .",
    "we thus proceed with the following effective lagrangian coupling a spin one field to the top and bottom quarks , @xmath18 vector resonances introduced in this manner occur in the bess model , for example @xcite .",
    "they have universal couplings to fermions that arise from mixing between the new vectors and the @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "in addition there can be non - universal direct couplings .",
    "we are interested only in the latter in the form of large new couplings to the @xmath12 and @xmath13 quarks because universal couplings are severely constrained by low energy observables .",
    "in fact , the most stringent constraints on the couplings in eq .",
    "( [ simplevp ] ) were found in ref .",
    "@xcite to arise from mixing between the new @xmath19 and the @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    ". a direct study of these couplings at high energy will therefore be most relevant for the case of negligible mixing and we concentrate on this case .    in hadron colliders , however , light quark annihilation represents a significant production source for new vector resonances even if they couple predominantly to @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this is an unfortunate complication because it forces us to commit to a specific model where the relative couplings between the new vectors and the heavy and light quarks are known . to keep our study as model - independent as possible",
    "we will illustrate our results for parameters that make the contributions of the light quark annihilation mechanism to resonance production small .",
    "we will also compare with a scalar resonance in which we assume no couplings to light fermions exist .",
    "for definiteness we will use the @xmath14 model of ref .",
    "@xcite in the limit of no @xmath20 mixing .",
    "there exist very tight constraints on the flavor changing neutral currents that appear in this model @xcite and therefore , our starting point in this paper will be the flavor diagonal interaction in the quark mass eigenstate basis , @xmath21 in this expression @xmath22 is the standard model @xmath23 gauge coupling , @xmath24 is the usual weak mixing angle and @xmath25 is a new parameter .",
    "also @xmath26 is summed over the sm quarks , and repeated indices are summed over the three generations . with large @xmath27 , this model provides a specific example of a new vector resonance with couplings to @xmath12 and @xmath13 that are significantly enhanced with respect to couplings to the light fermions . in the limit of large @xmath27 these couplings are purely right - handed , with @xmath28 we have checked numerically that the signals discussed in this paper would be very similar if we had left handed couplings instead .",
    "the resonance width into @xmath8 or @xmath9 pairs is and we considered large resonance masses . ]",
    "@xmath29 requiring the new interaction to remain perturbative leads to the theoretical constraint @xmath30 , equivalently @xmath31 .",
    "partial wave unitarity requirements do not improve this bound . for illustration purposes , throughout the paper , we will present numerical results with @xmath32 with this choice the couplings of @xmath19 to @xmath12 and @xmath13 are about 50 times larger than its couplings to the light quarks . at the same time the resonance remains narrow , with @xmath33 .",
    "notice that the value @xmath34 is about four times larger than the largest value we considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that case",
    "we were constrained by low energy bounds on @xmath35 mixing , whereas here we consider the case where that mixing is independent from the coupling @xmath36 and effectively remove the constraints .",
    "the relative branching fraction for the decays of the @xmath19 into @xmath8 and @xmath9 is governed simply by kinematics , @xmath37 for small @xmath38 , @xmath39 is much larger than @xmath40 .",
    "as @xmath38 nears @xmath41  gev , @xmath40 is only about @xmath42 of @xmath39 and increases to @xmath43 when @xmath38 is near 1  tev .",
    "we next consider the effective interaction between the third generation quarks and a new scalar resonance . in this case",
    "we will use a very simple ( non - renormalizable ) parametrization for the new interactions , and assume that the couplings of the scalar to the light fermions are completely negligible .",
    "we write @xmath44 this form allows us to parameterize simultaneously the cases where either the @xmath12-quark or the @xmath13-quark or both have enhanced couplings to the new scalar resonance .",
    "examples where the @xmath12 quark coupling ( rather than the @xmath13 quark coupling ) to a scalar is enhanced occur frequently in multi - higgs models with large @xmath45 .",
    "we will assume in this study that the scalar width is dominated by its decay into @xmath12 and @xmath13 pairs and that it receives a negligible contribution from decay into @xmath3 and @xmath4 pairs .",
    "this corresponds to taking @xmath46 in the models discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and therefore implies the existence of additional new resonances to restore unitarity in @xmath47 scattering amplitudes .",
    "the new couplings @xmath48 are related to the width of the scalar into quark pairs , @xmath49 as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite there are few constraints on these couplings from low energy observables",
    ". the tightest constraint is obtained by requiring perturbative unitarity  @xcite in the scattering amplitude @xmath50 ( or in @xmath51 ) through an exchange of the new scalar .",
    "this leads to @xmath52    the relative branching fraction for the new scalar resonance decay to @xmath8 and @xmath9 pairs is a free parameter depending on the square of the ratio @xmath53 . for our numerical illustrations",
    ", we will use @xmath54 this appears to be an unusual choice because in many models with couplings such as eq .",
    "( [ lstt ] ) one does not have simultaneously large @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "however , as we will see , different processes that we consider single out one of the couplings .",
    "the value we have chosen for these couplings results in an interaction that is weaker than it was in the vector case . a more detailed study would determine the sensitivity to the couplings in both scalar and vector case .",
    "for @xmath57  gev , @xmath58 is only about @xmath59 of @xmath60 , while for @xmath61  tev , it increases to @xmath62 .",
    "our choice of parameters will allow us to illustrate two slightly different cases , the scalar will be narrower than the vector and it will not receive any contribution from light quark annihilation .",
    "and ( b ) to @xmath64 from @xmath65 and @xmath66 processes at the tevatron for @xmath67  gev as a function of @xmath68.,width=529 ]    the processes @xmath69 receive enhanced contributions from the parton level processes @xmath70 involving the @xmath6-channel exchange of the new resonance .",
    "the vector resonance also receives corrections of electroweak strength from the parton level processes @xmath71 for a light quark @xmath72 .",
    "these contributions can actually be dominant in some regions of parameter space because the light quark content of the proton is much larger than its @xmath12 content .",
    "to the extent that this is possible , we will only consider cases where the @xmath8 annihilation mechanism dominates to keep our conclusions as model - independent as we can .    to this effect",
    "we compute the relative contributions of both mechanisms to the processes @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we present the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : bftev](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : bftev](b ) respectively .",
    "we select a resonance mass @xmath67  gev which is above threshold for @xmath9 production and about as large as can be probed by the tevatron .",
    "we present our results as a function of the resonance width @xmath68 . increasing the width corresponds to increasing the coupling to the top and bottom quarks while reducing the coupling to the light quarks . for this reason",
    "the fraction of signal events that originates in @xmath75 annihilation increases as a function of @xmath68 .",
    "we find that in @xmath8 production , at @xmath76  gev , more than @xmath77 of the signal is coming from @xmath75 annihilation . since",

    "( [ cotr ] ) , corresponding to @xmath80  gev for our tevatron studies .    for @xmath81 production on the other hand ,",
    "light quark annihilation represents a larger fraction of signal events than for @xmath8 production .",
    "figure  [ fig : bftev](b ) indicates that @xmath82  gev would be necessary for @xmath83 annihilation to produce 50% of the signal , and about @xmath84  gev for it to dominate .",
    "these values , however , correspond to unacceptably large couplings .",
    "we thus keep @xmath80  gev . in this case",
    "only 17% of the signal events are produced through the couplings that we want to study .",
    "we will be able to improve this situation with the higher energy available at the lhc .    for the scalar resonance the signal arises exclusively from @xmath75 annihilation for both @xmath75 and @xmath81 production because we are ignoring the couplings to the light quarks .",
    "it is evident that @xmath75 production will only be sensitive to @xmath55 , whereas @xmath81 production will be sensitive to the product @xmath85 . as we mentioned in the introduction , many scalars found in models commonly discussed have enhanced couplings to @xmath12 or @xmath13 but not to both at the same time .",

    "we have presented a preliminary study of signals for new resonances coupling to heavy quarks at the tevatron and the lhc . we have considered a scalar and a vector resonance with masses of 400  gev for the tevatron study and 1  tev for the lhc study and we have chosen couplings so that the resonances couple strongly to the top quark but are sufficiently narrow to be described by a breit - wigner shape .",
    "these parameters satisfy the existing constraints .",
    "the most direct production mechanism is the drell - yan process for @xmath152 and @xmath153 . at the tevatron , due to the rather low production rate and substantial background from the heavy quark production ,",
    "only a weak @xmath107 bound may be put on the vector state signal for @xmath154 gev .    at the lhc , on the other hand , the situation can be significantly improved .",
    "a @xmath121 statistical sensitivity may be reached for both a vector and a scalar state with @xmath155 tev",
    ". however , the large qcd backgrounds for the heavy quark pair production still lead to a low signal - to - background ratio ( less than 10@xmath156 ) near the resonance peaks .",
    "this renders the signal observation systematically difficult .",
    "we found that the most promising channels for the signal searches are multiple heavy quark production .",
    "the first class of processes is essentially due to the @xmath157 with a heavy resonance radiation off a heavy quark leg .",
    "consequently , the 4-quark signals @xmath158 and @xmath159 would have much less severe sm backgrounds .",
    "it is very interesting to note that the electroweak process @xmath160 , again associated with a heavy resonance radiation off the top quark , could lead to very strong signal as well .",
    "the reach can be up to @xmath161  tev with a @xmath121 significance .",
