    "cosmic inflation is the most compelling solution to the horizon and flatness problems of the standard , hot big bang cosmology . as an additional bonus",
    ", inflation can also generate the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath0 of the universe , which is necessary for the formation of the observed structures such as galaxies and galactic clusters .",
    "fortunately , a snapshot of the primordial curvature perturbation is reflected onto the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , whose temperature perturbations can provide detailed information about @xmath0 , such as the amplitude and scale dependence of its spectrum .",
    "the importance of this information lies in its discriminatory power as it offers , so far , the only tool which allows the testing of individual inflation models .",
    "detailed cosmological observations , not only of the cmb but also of the distribution of structures in the universe ( e.g. galaxy surveys ) , are in agreement with the generic predictions of inflation for @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , the observational evidence supports the existence of a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of predominantly adiabatic and gaussian superhorizon perturbations .",
    "inflation typically produces such perturbations through the amplification of the quantum fluctuations of suitable fields during a period of accelerated expansion of space .",
    "the process is called particle production and it is a manifestation of the hawking radiation process in de sitter space .",
    "now that observations of the products of this process are becoming ever more precise , model - builders are forced to construct inflationary models which are better and more closely connected with the theory , more detailed and rigorous , and more testable and falsifiable by comparison with the data .",
    "the question to be asked then is , which are those `` suitable fields '' , whose quantum fluctuations are the ultimate sources of the curvature perturbation and all the observed structures in the universe ?    a very useful tool in theoretical physics and , by extension , in cosmology has been the fundamental scalar quantum field .",
    "such scalar fields are ubiquitous in theories beyond the standard model such as supersymmetry ( the scalar partners of the observed fermion fields ) or string theory ( string moduli fields ) . in cosmology , a scalar field",
    "is usually assumed to drive the dynamics of inflation ( inflaton field ) or even give rise to the accelerated expansion at present ( quintessence field ) .",
    "it is not surprising , therefore , that the particle production process , responsible for the generation of @xmath0 , has until recently been considered only in the context of scalar fields .",
    "so useful a tool is a scalar field that one tends to forget that , as yet , it is no more than a theoretical construction , whose physical existence is only conjectured , since no fundamental scalar quantum field has ever been observed .",
    "one could wonder therefore whether other kinds of fields contributed to the generation of the curvature perturbation in the universe .",
    "what if scalar fields did not exist ? could the galaxies form without them ?",
    "recently , the contribution of vector boson fields to the curvature perturbation is attracting growing attention . in the pioneering work in ref .",
    "@xcite a mechanism was introduced , which could potentially allow a single vector field to generate the observed curvature perturbation .",
    "the mechanism was the first such suggestion in the literature and was based on the curvaton idea , which was developed for scalar fields in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) in order to alleviate the fine - tunning problems of inflation model - building @xcite .",
    "the vector curvaton mechanism assumes that the vector field has a negligible contribution to the energy budget of the universe during inflation , when on the one hand it becomes homogenised , but on the other hand can also obtain a scale - invariant superhorizon spectrum of perturbations due to some appropriate breaking of its conformality .",
    "after inflation the density parameter of the vector field grows , especially after the mass of the vector field becomes important ( larger than the hubble scale ) . when this happens , the zero - mode undergoes coherent oscillations during which the vector field acts as pressureless , _ isotropic _ matter @xcite .",
    "hence , it can dominate ( or nearly dominate ) the universe without generating excessive anisotropic expansion , avoiding thus the primary obstacle for using vector fields to generate @xmath0 . when the field dominates the universe it imposes its curvature perturbation spectrum according to the curvaton scenario @xcite .",
    "the vector curvaton mechanism is a paradigm in search of a model , much like inflation itself .",
    "the main ingredient necessary is a mechanism for the generation of a flat spectrum of vector field perturbations during inflation .",
    "this is a problem which was originally addressed by efforts to generate a coherent primordial magnetic field during inflation , in order to source the magnetic fields of the galaxies ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as realised in ref .",
    "@xcite , the particle production process can operate with vector fields only when their conformal invariance is appropriately broken . a number of proposals have been put forward for this to occur during inflation @xcite .",
    "for example , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a flat spectrum of vector field perturbations is generated if the effective mass - squared of the vector field during inflation is , where @xmath1 is the inflationary hubble scale . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that this could be achieved if the vector field is non - minimally coupled to gravity with a coupling of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the ricci scalar .",
    "this idea was employed in the vector curvaton mechanism in ref .",
    "another possibility was to consider a varying kinetic function as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . the first attempt to implement this idea to",
    "the vector curvaton mechanism is in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the above early works on the vector curvaton",
    ", attention was paid mainly on the transverse components of the vector field perturbations .",
    "the reason was that the vector curvaton mechanism employs the fractional perturbation of the density of the vector field , which is a scalar quantity , i.e. isotropic .",
    "indeed , the mechanism does not cause any anisotropic expansion because , when the zero - mode of the field undergoes rapid coherent oscillations , so do the field s perturbations .",
    "thus , the transverse components were deemed enough to generate @xmath0 and the longitudinal component was ignored .",
    "this turned out to miss a key effect introduced to the curvature perturbation from vector fields , namely statistical anisotropy .",
    "statistical anisotropy in the curvature perturbation is a new observable and it amounts to direction dependent patterns in the cmb temperature perturbations as well as in the large scale structure ( e.g. rows of galaxies ) if it is intense enough .",
    "the observational limit on such a signal is rather weak as statistical anisotropy in the spectrum of @xmath0 is allowed up to as much as 30% @xcite .",
    "this implies that it is likely to be observed by the forthcoming observations of the planck satellite mission which will detect statistical anisotropy in the spectrum if it is larger than @xmath4 @xcite , while there is no reason to think that this will be the ultimate limit .",
    "another possible indication of statistical anisotropy in the curvature perturbation is the alignment of the quadrupole and octupole moments of the cmb ( the so - called `` axis of evil '' @xcite ) and of galaxy spins @xcite .",
    "the alignment of the low cmb multipoles was shown to persist beyond foreground removal @xcite despite being statistically extremely unlikely with isotropic perturbations ( see also @xcite ) . moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite it is claimed that the preferred direction of the alignment of galactic spins appears to coincide with the `` axis of evil '' , as one would expect if they were both due to statistical anisotropy in @xmath0 .",
    "it has to be noted that statistical anisotropy can not be introduced by scalar fields alone , so if its observation is confirmed , this would be a powerful indication that vector fields at least affect @xmath0 .",
    "the first study of the generation of statistical anisotropy by a vector field is in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a vector field is assumed to modulate the decay of the inflaton . in a separate development @xcite it was pointed out that even a homogeneous vector field will generate statistical anisotropy in @xmath0 , because it will break the statistical isotropy of the scalar field perturbation generated from the vacuum fluctuation .",
    "this is further explored in ref .",
    "a comprehensive model - independent study of statistical anisotropy can be found in ref .",
    "the study employs the @xmath5 formalism @xcite , extending it to include the effects of vector fields . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that a vector field can alone generate @xmath0 through the vector curvaton mechanism only if _ the particle production process is approximately isotropic_. otherwise , the contribution of the vector curvaton field has to be subdominant and its significance amounts to the generation of statistical anisotropy only . as an application ,",
    "the @xmath2 vector curvaton model was revisited and shown to result in statistical anisotropy of order unity , which would be excessive if the vector field were to provide the dominant contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "in such a case , the only way that excessive statistical anisotropy can be avoided without introducing another dominant ( and statistically isotropic ) source of curvature perturbations ( such as scalar fields ) is by considering either a triad of identical vector fields each perpendicular to the other two @xcite or hundreds of identical vector fields , randomly oriented in space .",
    "in such a case anisotropy in the spectrum or in the expansion can be avoided or suppressed , which means that vector fields could also act as inflatons , without generating anisotropic expansion .    using vector fields as inflatons was first considered in ref .",
    "more recently , vector field inflation has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite with the @xmath2 model , involving hundreds of randomly oriented vector fields . for more studies of similar vector inflation models see refs .  @xcite . in the same spirit , vector fields",
    "have been considered as candidates for dark energy @xcite .",
    "furthermore , refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite investigate inflation or dark energy respectively , using yang - mills fields .",
    "finally , inflation with @xmath6-forms is explored in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "also obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite is the contribution of vector fields in the bispectrum of the curvature perturbation ( for the trispectrum see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . using these results , in ref .",
    "@xcite the non - gaussianity in the spectrum is studied in a model - independent way , though the results are applied to the models of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . a recent study in ref .",
    "@xcite , extends this treatment in the case of non - abelian vector fields , applying the results in the @xmath2 model .",
    "in all cases , it is shown that statistical anisotropy in the spectrum and bispectrum are correlated .",
    "this is a smoking gun for the contribution of a vector field to the curvature perturbation .",
    "it is likely that the planck mission will observe non - zero non - gaussianity in the cmb temperature perturbations .",
    "if this is the case then simple single - scalar - field models of inflation will be ruled out .",
    "if an angular modulation of the non - linearity parameter @xmath7 , which quantifies non - gaussianity , is also observed , then this is a strong indication of the contribution of vector fields to @xmath0 .",
    "an important aspect of the mechanisms which break the conformality of vector fields and result in particle production of their perturbations during inflation is the appearance of instabilities .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath2 model was criticised for giving rise to ghosts and other instabilities , e.g. when the modes of the perturbations exit the horizon , although in ref .",
    "@xcite the latter was demonstrated not to be a problem ( also see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion on ghosts ) . for a comprehensive analysis on ghosts and tachyon instabilities see also ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper we introduce a new model of vector curvaton , which does not suffer from such instabilities ( see also ref .",
    "the model consists of a massive abelian vector field with a maxwell type kinetic term , whose kinetic function is modulated during inflation similarly to the models in ref .",
    "our model is a follow up of ref .",
    "@xcite , which did not consider statistical anisotropy .",
    "we attempt a detailed analytical investigation and confirm our findings numerically .",
    "as we demonstrate , our vector curvaton model gives rise to a rich phenomenology .",
    "in particular , when the mass of the vector field is smaller than the inflationary hubble scale the vector curvaton can give rise to statistical anisotropy in both the spectrum and bispectrum , with the angular modulation dominating @xmath7 , rendering thus the model , in this case , falsifiable by observations in the near future . when the mass of the vector field is larger than the inflationary hubble scale though , particle production is isotropic and the vector field can alone generate the observed curvature perturbation . the parameter space for both regimes is shown to be substantial .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows . in sec .  ii we present our model and obtain the equations of motion of the perturbations of the vector field components in momentum space . in sec .",
    "iii we study particle production in order to obtain the desired scaling of the mass and the kinetic function of the vector field , which results in the production of a scale invariant superhorizon spectrum of perturbations . in secs .",
    "iv and v we calculate in detail the power spectra of the perturbations in the two possible alternatives for the scaling of the kinetic function . to this end",
    "we obtain the evolution of the mode functions of the perturbations , through analytic approximations of high precision . in sec .",
    "vi we calculate the statistical anisotropy in the spectrum and bispectrum of the produced perturbations in all cases . in sec .",
    "vii we study the evolution of the zero mode of the vector boson condensate , during and after inflation .",
    "the evolution of the zero mode is necessary in order to determine the cosmology after inflation as well as calculate the curvature perturbation . in sec .",
    "viii we apply the vector curvaton mechanism in order to obtain constraints on the model parameters such as the mass of the vector field and the inflationary hubble scale . in sec .",
    "ix we present two toy - models which demonstrate how the desired scaling of the mass and the kinetic function of the vector field can be obtained in a natural way in the context of supergravity and superstrings . in sec .",
    "x we summarise and discuss our findings . finally , in sec .",
    "xi we present our conclusions . throughout the paper we use natural units such that and newton s gravitational constant is , where is the reduced planck mass .",
    "consider the lagrangian density for a massive , abelian vector field @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the kinetic function , @xmath10 is the mass and the field strength tensor is .",
    "the above can be the lagrangian density of a massive abelian gauge field , in which case @xmath9 is the gauge kinetic function .",
    "however , we need not restrict ourselves to gauge fields only . if no gauge symmetry is considered the argument in support of the above maxwell type kinetic term is that it is one of the few ( three ) choices @xcite which avoids introducing instabilities , such as ghosts @xcite . also , we note here that a massive vector field which is not a gauge field is renormalizable only if it is abelian @xcite .",
    "we focus , at first , on a period of cosmic inflation , during which we assume that the contribution of the vector field to the energy budget of the universe is minute and can be ignored .",
    "thus , we take the inflationary expansion to be isotropic .",
    "we also assume that inflation is of quasi - de sitter type , i.e. the hubble parameter is @xmath11constant .",
    "we will consider that , during inflation , and can be functions of cosmic time @xmath12 .",

    "the vector curvaton contribution to the curvature perturbation is strongly anisotropic , which means that at decay .",
    "in this paper we studied a particularly promising vector curvaton model consisting of a massive abelian vector field , with a maxwell type kinetic term and with varying kinetic function @xmath9 and mass @xmath10 during inflation .",
    "the model is rather generic , it does not suffer from instabilities such as ghosts and may be naturally realised in the context of theories beyond the standard model such as supergravity and superstrings .",
    "we have parametrised the time dependence of the kinetic function as , where is the scale factor .",
    "our model offers two distinct possibilities . if ( possible for ) the vector field can only produce a subdominant contribution to the curvature perturbation @xmath0 , but it can be the source of statistical anisotropy in the spectrum and bispectrum .",
    "in fact , non - gaussianity in this case is predominantly anisotropic , which means that , if a non - zero @xmath7 is observed without angular modulation , then our model is falsified in the case .",
    "the second possibility ( possible for only ) corresponds to . in this case",
    "the vector field can alone generate the curvature perturbation @xmath0 without any contribution from other sources such as scalar fields .",
    "if particle production is isotropic and the model does not generate any statistical anisotropy .",
    "the vector field begins oscillating a few e - folds before the end of inflation but its density remains constant until inflation ends .",
    "the parameter space for this case can be exponentially large , i.e. .",
    "significant non - gaussianity can be generated , provided the vector field decays before it dominates the universe , in which case @xmath7 is found to be identical to the scalar curvaton scenario . in other words , if , our vector curvaton can reproduce the results of the scalar curvaton paradigm .",
    "finally , if the vector field can alone generate the curvature perturbation @xmath0 but it can also generate statistical anisotropy in the spectrum and bispectrum . in this case , the anisotropy in @xmath7 is subdominant and equal to the statistical anisotropy in the spectrum , which is a characteristic signature of this possibility .",
    "we have also found that inflation has to occur at relatively high energies , with in the ( almost ) isotropic and in the anisotropic case ( with ) .",
    "these bounds correspond to prompt reheating , with which could result in gravitino overproduction .",
    "however , if the vector curvaton dominates the universe , its decay could release enough entropy to efficiently dilute the density of the gravitinos . furthermore , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , one could substantially reduce the inflationary scale through introducing an increment to the mass of the vector field , say at a phase transition , after the end of inflation , following the mechanism first suggested for the scalar curvaton scenario in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for our model to work @xmath9 and @xmath10 should vary in a specific manner , which requires tuning .",
    "we have outlined two possibilities for achieving the desired modulation for these quantities .",
    "first , we considered that the quantities in question are modulated by a string modulus field , which could also play the role of the inflaton . in this case",
    "we found that the potential of the modulus has to be approximately exponential , which is reasonable . the second possibility which we discussed was that of a higgsed vector curvaton in the context of supergravity theories , where scalar fields during inflation obtain an effective mass of order the hubble scale .",
    "we showed that a higgs field with tachyonic mass @xmath377 suffices to account for the desired modulation for @xmath10 , while it is natural to expect that the gauge kinetic function is modulated by the fast - rolling scalar fields of the theory such that as required .",
    "these examples demonstrate that the tuning of the modulation of @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be attained in a realistic manner .",
    "this should be contrasted with the traditional case of generating the curvature perturbation using scalar fields , where their effective mass needs to be fine - tuned at least by @xmath378 against khler corrections to produce an approximately scale - invariant spectrum ( the famous @xmath379-problem ) . in our model , the vector field also needs to be effectively massless ( ) when the cosmological scales exit the horizon but , to our knowledge , there is no compelling reason why this should not be so .",
    "note also , that the vector field can become heavy by the end of inflation in the case .",
    "we considered de  sitter inflation in our treatment so that the obtained spectra were exactly scale invariant if and .",
    "deviations from the harrison - zeldovich spectrum can be attained either by perturbing the modulation of @xmath9 and @xmath10 or by considering quasi - de sitter inflation , with .",
    "even though in our specific examples we employed scalar fields to modulate @xmath9 and @xmath10 , in principle their variation can be controlled by any kind of degree of freedom which varies during inflation . in that sense",
    ", this model can generate the curvature perturbation in the universe without direct involvement of fundamental scalar fields . of course",
    ", theories beyond the standard model are abundant with scalar fields and vector fields alike .",
    "the next step , therefore , is to realise this vector curvaton model in the context of realistic extensions of the standard model .",
