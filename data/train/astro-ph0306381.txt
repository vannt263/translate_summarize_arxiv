    "we present the first results from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) _ , which completed its first year of observations on august 9 , 2002 .",
    "dave wilkinson , for whom the satellite was renamed , was a friend and colleague to many of the conference participants .",
    "he was a leader in the development of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) as a potent cosmological probe .",
    "he died on september 5 , 2002 , after battling cancer for 17 years , all the while advancing our understanding of the origin and evolution of the universe .",
    "he saw the data in their full glory and was pleased with what i am able to report to you in the following .    at the time of the conference ,",
    "the data were not ready to be released .",
    "the presentation focused on what _ wmap _ would add to the considerable advances that had been made over the past few years .",
    "the emphasis was on the data ; a companion talk by ned wright showed how the data are interpreted in the context of the currently favored models .",
    "some effort was made to show what we knew firmly , like the position of the first acoustic peak in the cmb , as opposed to quantities that we knew better through the combination of multiple experiments , such as the characteristics of the second acoustic peak and the possible level of foreground contamination .",
    "since the conference , there have been 17 papers by the _ wmap _ team describing the instrument and data .",
    "this contribution draws heavily from those papers .",
    "bennett  ( 2003a ) lay out the goals of the mission and give an overview of the instrument .",
    "more detailed descriptions of the radiometers , optics , and feed horns are found in jarosik  ( 2003a ) , page  ( 2003a ) , and barnes  ( 2002 ) .",
    "the inflight characterization of the receivers , optics , and sidelobes are described in jarosik  ( 2003b ) , page  ( 2003b ) , and barnes  ( 2003 ) .",
    "the data processing and checks for systematic errors are described by hinshaw  ( 2003a ) , and hinshaw  ( 2003b ) present the angular power spectrum .",
    "bennett  ( 2003c ) present the analysis of the foreground emission .",
    "the temperature - polarization correlation is described in kogut  ( 2003 ) , and komatsu  ( 2003 ) show that the fluctuations are gaussian .",
    "verde  ( 2003 ) present the details of the analysis of the angular power spectrum and show how the _ wmap _ data can be combined with external data sets such as the 2dfgrs ( colless  2001 ) .",
    "spergel  ( 2003 ) present the cosmological parameters derived from the _ wmap _ alone , as well as the parameters derived from _",
    "wmap _ in combination with the external data sets .",
    "peiris  ( 2003 ) confront the data with models of the early universe , in particular inflation .",
    "the features in the power spectrum are interpreted in page  ( 2003c ) .",
    "the scientific results are summarized in bennett  ( 2003b ) .",
    "it is of interest that the reduced @xmath3 for the best - fit model has a probability to exceed of @xmath4% .",
    "the reduced @xmath3 is slightly large , but on its own does not signal that the model is wrong .",
    "in fact , no matter what model we try , @xmath5 more or less stays the same . if isocurvature modes are added to fit the low-@xmath6 region of the spectrum , @xmath7 ( peiris   2003 ) ; if one adds tensor modes , allows the spectral index @xmath8 to run , and the 2dfrgs data are added , @xmath9 ; if a step is added to the power spectrum that attempts to fit bumps and wiggles in the _ wmap _ angular power spectrum , @xmath10 ( peiris   2003 ) . in other words , the admixture of additional model elements does not substantially improve the fit over the basic model .",
    "the contributions to @xmath5 are shown in figure  [ fig : chisq ] .",
    "it is likely that , as the sky is covered more thoroughly , as we understand the beams better , and as we account for more detailed astrophysical effects ( spergel   2003 ) , @xmath3 will decrease .    though the simple model is a wonderful fit to the _ wmap _ data ,",
    "the small quadrupole and the related lack of correlation at large angular separations is striking .",
    "though largely obscured by cosmic variance , there appears not even a hint of an upturn at low @xmath6 , as expected in @xmath1cdm models .",
    "( however , _",
    "cobe _ also found no evidence for such an upturn ) .",
    "this departure from the model constitutes a small ( though possibly important ) fraction of the total fluctuation power and does not cast doubt on the interpretation of the @xmath11 spectrum .",
    "the correlation function is shown in figure  [ fig : corrfcn ] .",
    "for @xmath12 the probability that the _ wmap _ data agree with the best - fit @xmath1cdm models _ at these angular scales _ is @xmath13 .",
    "one must keep in mind that the statistic is _ a posteriori _ , but it is still unsettling .      before it was widely appreciated that so many of the cosmological parameters could be deduced directly from the cmb ( e.g. , jungman  1995 ) , the motivation for studying the anisotropy was that it would tell us the initial conditions for the formation of cosmic structure and would tell us the cosmogony in which to interpret that process . in this vein , we summarize here some of the grander conclusions we have learned from _",
    "wmap_.    1 .   a flat @xmath1-dominated cdm model with just six parameters ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath8 ) gives an excellent description of the statistical properties of @xmath19 measurements of the anisotropy over 85% of the sky .",
    "this does not mean that a simple flat @xmath1cdm model is complete , but any other model must look very much like it .",
    "an einstein - de  sitter model , which is flat with @xmath20 , is ruled out at @xmath21 .",
    "this statement is based on just the cmb , with no prior information ( e.g. , no prior on @xmath18 ) .",
    "stated another way , if @xmath22 then _ wmap _ requires @xmath23 in the angular - diameter distance to the decoupling surface .",
    "3 .   a closed model with @xmath24 and @xmath20",
    "fits the data but requires @xmath25 , in conflict with _ hst _ observations .",
    "it also disagrees with cluster abundances , velocity flows , and other cosmic probes .",
    "the fluctuations in the metric are superhorizon ( peiris  2003 ) .",
    "turok ( 1996 ) showed that in principle one can construct models based on subhorizon processes that can mimic the tt @xmath1cdm spectra .",
    "however , these models can not mimic the observed te anticorrelation at @xmath26 ( spergel & zaldarriaga 1997 ) .    by combining _",
    "wmap _ data with other probes we can constrain the mass of the neutrino and constrain the equation of state , @xmath27 . as our knowledge of the large - scale structure matures ,",
    "in particular of the ly@xmath28 forest ( mcdonald   2000 ; zaldarriaga , hui , & tegmark 2001 ; croft   2002 ; gnedin & hamilton   2002 ; seljak , mcdonald , & markarov 2003 ) , we can use the combination of these measurements to probe in detail the spectral index as a function of scale , thereby directly constraining inflation and other related models . no doubt correlations with other measurements",
    "will shed light on other cosmic phenomena . with _ wmap _",
    ", physical cosmology has moved from assuming a model and deducing cosmic parameters to detailed testing of a standard model .",
    "the _ wmap _ mission is currently funded to run through october 2005 , though as of this writing there is nothing to limit the satellite from operating longer . the quality of the maps will continue to improve as the mission progresses .",
    "not only will the noise integrate down , but our knowledge of the beams will continue to improve , and we will make corrections that were too small to consider for the year one analysis . for example , increased knowledge of the beams will reduce the uncertainties in the power spectrum at high @xmath6 and will permit an even cleaner separation of the cmb and foreground components near the galactic plane .",
    "it is the set of high - fidelity maps of the microwave sky that will be _ wmap _ s most important legacy .    with four - year maps ,",
    "the polarization at intermediate and large angular scale should be seen and the epoch of reionization will be much better constrained .",
    "it may even be possible to detect the lensing of the cmb by the intervening mass fluctuations .",
    "on the horizon is the _",
    "planck _ satellite , which , with its higher sensitivity , greater resolution , and larger frequency range should , significantly expand upon the picture presented by _",
    "wmap_. in addition , a host of other measurements that push to yet finer angular scales and a future satellite dedicated to measuring the polarization in the cmb , especially the @xmath29 modes , promise a rich and exciting future for cmb studies ."
