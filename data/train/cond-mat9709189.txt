    "it is believed , on both experimental and theoretical grounds , that superconductivity and charge transport in high @xmath0 cuprates are mostly confined to the @xmath1 planes [ 1,2 ] ; and hence the attention of many physicists has been dedicated to 2d models which contain as an essential feature a competition between the band picture and highly correlated many body effects .",
    "of course , some features of the phase diagram , like the existence of a finite nel temperature , can only be explained by adding a coupling between the planes .",
    "the bonding combination of @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals turns out to be quite deep below the fermi level , so that no dynamical freedom is left to treat @xmath4 and @xmath5 orbitals separately [ 3 ] ( there are some strong experimental evidences , mostly based on the study of the knight shift , that in the @xmath1 plane one spin degree of freedom is observed [ 4 ] ) . through the pauli principle ,",
    "the energy of the @xmath5 electron excitation is , for example , largely modified by the change of charge and spin states of the neighboring @xmath2 ions .",
    "a @xmath5 electron and charge and spin fluctuations on neighboring @xmath2 ions are simultaneously excited so that electronic excitations are formed on a @xmath1 cluster as a whole .",
    "then , the resulting complex can be described by a single - band hubbard model [ 5 ] .    in the simplest form ,",
    "the hubbard model , first introduced to describe the correlations of electrons in a narrow @xmath4-band of transition metals , contains a kinetic term which describes the motion of the electrons among the sites of the bravais lattice and an interaction term between electrons of opposite spin on the same lattice site . by varying the model parameters",
    ", it is believed that the hubbard model is capable of describing many properties of strongly correlated fermion systems . among different examples ,",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian is applicable to describe the metal - insulator transition in a series of transition metal oxides such as @xmath6 [ 6,7 ] and @xmath7 [ 8 - 11 ] .",
    "the applicability of the model to the superconducting copper - oxides is related to the fact that upon doping most of these compounds exhibit a metal - insulator mott transition ; the superconducting state is near the nel state and there are many experimental results [ 12 - 15 ] which show a close relation between the antiferromagnetic correlations in the @xmath8 planes and the occurrence of the superconducting phase .",
    "however , it is important to stress that an appropriate description of a bad metal with large energy scale spin fluctuations by means of a purely electrostatic hamiltonian should preserve the symmetry expressed by the pauli principle that codifies the correct interplay between charge and magnetic configurations [ 16 - 18 ] .",
    "although considerable attention has been devoted to the hubbard model and significant progress was achieved in understanding ground state properties , particularly at half - filling , static and dynamical spin correlations , the optical conductivity and other observables , a clear comprehension of the low - lying excitations is still lacking [ 2 ] .",
    "the difficulty is not to be found only in the absence of any obvious small parameter in the strong coupling regime .",
    "more deeply , it is due to the difficulty of handling simultaneously itinerant aspects ( spatial correlations ) and atomic aspects ( pronounced on- site quantum fluctuations ) [ 19 ] .    in recent years",
    "we have been developing a method of calculation , denominated composite operator method ( com ) [ 17,18,20 - 32 ] , that has been revealed to be a powerful tool for the description of local and itinerant excitations in strongly correlated systems . in previous papers , we considered the hubbard electronic operators for the determination of fundamental excitations . a fully self - consistent calculation of the electronic propagator has been realized by means of a constraint with the physical content of the pauli principle [ 17 , 23 - 25 ] .",
    "we calculated local quantities , as the double occupancy and the magnetic moment [ 17,23 ] , the energy per site [ 24 ] , the chemical potential [ 24 ] , the magnetic susceptibility [ 25 , 29 ] , the density of states and the quasi - particle spectra [ 28 , 32 ] .",
    "in all the cases , the results show a good agreement with those obtained by numerical simulation . in particular , the results obtained for the magnetic properties can reproduce the unusual characteristics observed in high @xmath0 superconducting materials [ 25 , 29 , 33 ] .",
    "therefore , the agreement strengthens the idea that a microscopic single - band model contains the essential physical features of the new class of materials .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the electronic specific heat and the entropy per site of the 2d hubbard model for a paramagnetic ground state .",
    "it will be shown that all the features of these quantities can be understood by looking at the dependence of the chemical potential and double occupancy on their conjugate thermodynamic variables , that is , the particle concentration and the on- site coulomb repulsion , respectively .",
    "a comprehensive comparison among different methods to compute the specific heat will shed a new light on the approximation used .",
    "it will emerge that in our theoretical scheme , even if dynamical effects in the self - energy are neglected promoting unstable collective asymptotic modes to the role of well - defined quasi - particle excitations , extended spin modes can be captured by properly combining symmetry requirements and extended operatorial basis .",
    "indeed , the presence of a low temperature peak that appears when the low - lying spin states are excited will appear as an important feature shared with the quantum monte carlo data [ 34 ] .",
    "in addition , an alternative fermionic scenario for the computation of the electronic specific heat together with the results for the wilson ratio will confirm cuprates as dominated by conventional fermionic excitations .",
    "an extensive study of the thermodynamic response functions will reveal the existence of critical lines which separate different energy scales created by the interplay between charge and spin modes .",
    "in other words a study of thermodynamics quantities , such as the double occupancy , the entropy , the chemical potential , the specific heat , indicates lines in the @xmath9 plane which separate a highly - correlated behavior , dominated by spin and charge fluctuations and a non - interacting behavior , dominated by thermal fluctuations . in particular , there emerges a region of filling where the entropy reduces by increasing the filling signalling the set up of an ordered phase .",
    "for @xmath10 there is a well - defined marginal concentration where a quantum phase transition occurs .",
    "a detailed comparison with the non - interacting case will be also presented throughout the paper .",
    "the plan of the article is as follows . in the next section we present the 2d hubbard model and the electron propagator in the com . in sec .",
    "iii we review experimental data for some thermodynamic properties .",
    "the results for the electronic specific heat are presented in sec iv , where a theoretical understanding of the different ways to compute the specific heat is also presented .",

    "vi the results for the chemical potential versus temperature are discussed .",

    "the point of view adopted in the com is that the heisenberg operators @xmath27 are not good candidates as a basis for calculations . because of strong correlations the @xmath15electrons loose their identity and new fields , whose properties are self - consistently determined by the dynamics and by the symmetries of the model , together with the boundary conditions , might be more appropriate as a starting point for the physical description of the system . due to the on - site coulomb interaction ,",

    "11 and 14 it is worthwhile to stress that the presence of a maximum in @xmath68 does not necessarily indicate a pure fermionic excitation spectrum ; it is a consequence of the enhancement in the density of states when the fermi energy crosses the vhs .",

    "in other words , the curve indicates the presence of a t region where the formation of local magnetic moments is enhanced with increasing t [ the double occupancy d determines the local spin - spin correlation function @xmath198 through the equation @xmath199 .",
    "this behavior is characteristic of incipient localization effects in a strongly correlated fermi liquid in a regime dominated by spin fluctuations .",
    "starting from the low temperature fermi liquid regime , when the temperature increases , the system can gain free energy by localizing the particles ( i.e. decreasing d ) in order to take advantage of a larger spin entropy [ 19,53 ] . in the absence of spin excitations",
    "one would observe decreasing values with increasing t.    in fig .",

    "the values of n and u are large enough to inhibit localization effects due to the increase of temperature . to study this behavior in more detail this behavior , the derivative with respect to the temperature of the double occupancy has been analyzed .",

    "when @xmath208 we have @xmath209 for all values of u. the behavior of @xmath210 as a function of @xmath120 is reported in the fig .",
    "the fact that @xmath211 implies that at @xmath212 the double occupancy does not depend on t. however , the curves of d as function of u for different values of t will not cross in a single point because @xmath200 changes with the temperature in a significant way .    at very high temperature @xmath213 , larger than @xmath178 where there is a change in the concavity , d asymptotically tends to the atomic value @xmath214 , as expected .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that the specific heat curves versus t for different values of u cross almost at the same point @xmath178 , determined by the equation @xmath215    a study of this equation by means of formula ( 5.3 ) gives the results plotted in fig .",
    "19 , where @xmath178 is plotted versus u for @xmath160 .",
    "from the solution of the fermionic propagator and by means of eqs . ( 4.25 ) we obtain the following behavior for the temperature derivative of the chemical potential @xmath216    the function @xmath217 is presented in fig .",
    "it can be shown that at @xmath126 @xmath218 coincides with @xmath219 , the critical value where the fermi level crosses the van hove singularity .",
    "but , the temperature dependence of @xmath217 is remarkably different from the one of @xmath220 .",
    "thus , only for @xmath10 we may relate the transition @xmath221 to the reversal of the sign of the derivative for the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "furthermore , we observe that @xmath217 reaches the value of 1 for some temperature @xmath222 ( for @xmath150 we find @xmath223 ) . when @xmath224 we have @xmath225 for all values of @xmath120 .",
    "the fact that @xmath226 implies that at @xmath227 the chemical potential does not depend on t. therefore , the curves of @xmath21 as function of @xmath120 for various values of @xmath92 , reported in fig",

    "the entropy @xmath228 , connected to the total number of spin and charge excitations at temperature t and filling @xmath120 , is a bulk thermodynamic quantity uniquely determined by the spectrum of excitations , whose magnitude and temperature dependence provide an important test for proposed theories .",
    "theoretical works available so far are the following .",
    "bipolaron models propose preformed boson charge carriers at @xmath0 and behaving classically at higher temperatures . apart from some inconsistency related to the magnitude of the entropy",
    ", these theories have to resort to the existence of thermally excited triplet bipolarons in explaining the deviation of s from a linear t - dependence in underdoped samples [ 64 ] .",
    "theoretical studies of the entropy in the strongly correlated electron systems have also been performed in the framework of the statistical spin liquid [ 65 - 68 ] .",
    "this scheme is based on the assumption that in the strongly correlated metals the doubly occupied single - spin configurations must be excluded not only in the real space representation , but also in the reciprocal space . by means of the spin liquid statistics ,",
    "the entropy of localized moments is reproduced when the mott insulator limit is reached for half - filling .",
    "nevertheless , this over imposed statistics freezes the system in a wrong hilbert space whenever different choices of the parameters modify the interplay between thermal excitations and electronic interactions .",
    "some theories [ 3 ] predict decoupled holon ( boson ) and spinon ( fermion ) excitations . in these approaches",
    "it is difficult to reconcile the experimentally observed magnitude for the entropy with its partition between statistically independent excitations .",
    "moreover , the striking numerical correlation between @xmath94 and @xmath95 is expected for weakly interacting fermions but not if the dominant excitations are those of spinless bosons . in ref .",
    "63 exact diagonalization studies of the @xmath229 model have been performed ; for several thermodynamic quantities a critical doping concentration that marks a change of the fermi surface character is found .    by means of the relation ( 4.7 ) , we have calculated the entropy per site @xmath228 .",
    "recalling the behavior of @xmath230 , we see that the entropy must have the following behavior    \\(i ) for @xmath231 , @xmath228 increases with increasing particle concentration , reaches a maximum for @xmath232 , then decreases ( see fig .",
    "22a ) ;    \\(ii ) for @xmath224 , @xmath228 always increases with increasing particle concentration ( for @xmath150 we find @xmath223 ) as is shown in fig .",
    "again the peak structure reflects a fermi level crossing the vhs at the critical doping .",
    "this behavior is in agreement with the experimental data from refs .",
    "38 , 39 and 52 .",
    "indeed , the experiments show a well defined peak structure in a large region of temperature ( from 40k to 320k ) ; furthermore , the position of the peak slightly changes with temperature . in the theoretical analysis",
    "the position of the peak as a function of temperature is governed by @xmath217 , reported in fig .",
    "20 , that shows a smooth variation in the region of physical relevance ( @xmath233 ) . in fig .",
    "23 the entropy versus the particle concentration is reported for various values of the coulomb interaction .    the maximum of the entropy shifts to lower values of @xmath120 by increasing u , varying between 1 and 2/3 when u varies from zero to @xmath234 . in fig .",
    "24 , we see that for @xmath235 all entropy curves for different u cross at the same particle concentration . by comparison with figure 21 and by numerical analysis",
    ", we see that the crossing point is exactly the critical concentration @xmath217 . recalling the maxwell relation @xmath236 the behavior shown in fig .",
    "22 implies @xmath237 .",
    "if we remember that the double occupancy @xmath129 determines the local spin - spin correlation function , it is clear that a sign reversal of its derivative with respect to the temperature represents a crossover from a regime dominated by spin fluctuations , where s is a decreasing function of u , to another regime favouring charge fluctuations ( electronic delocalization ) , where the entropy is an increasing function of u.    in figs .",
    "25 and 26 we report the temperature dependence of @xmath89 and @xmath94 for several dopant concentrations .",
    "the curves have a qualitative agreement with the experimental ones [ 38,39,52 ] . in fig . 25a , where @xmath187",
    ", s is a decreasing function of @xmath86 at a fixed temperature ; the opposite behavior is observed in fig .",
    "25b .    in the limit of zero temperature",
    "the entropy goes to zero by a linear law .",
    "when t increases the entropy deviates from the linear behavior . in the region @xmath238",
    "the temperature dependence is well described by the law @xmath239 where the coefficients @xmath240 , @xmath241 , @xmath242 are strongly dependent on the filling .",
    "it is worth noticing that in the limit of large temperatures ( a weak point of the statistical spin liquid [ 65 - 68 ] ) our results for the entropy asymptotically agree with the exact expression @xmath243 for non - interacting fermions at @xmath93 we have @xmath244 where @xmath96 is the bulk susceptibility and @xmath22 is the wilson ratio @xmath245 in the case of @xmath185 [ 38 ] and of @xmath74 [ 39,52,69 ] , there is a striking numerical correlation between @xmath94 and @xmath95 . as noticed by loram et al .",
    ", this resemblance shows that the total spin+charge spectrum over all moments @xmath246 ( from s ) and the @xmath247 spin spectrum ( from @xmath96 ) have a similar energy dependence . also , experimental evidences suggest that the low - energy excitations are predominantly those of conventional fermions , and that the substantial t dependencies of @xmath94 and @xmath96 are primarily determined by the energy dependence of the single - particle density of states in the vicinity of the fermi level .    in fig .",
    "27 we present @xmath248 as a function of the temperature for various values of doping ( i.e. , @xmath249 ) . for all values of dopant concentration @xmath248 is almost constant over a wide range of temperatures .",
    "in addition , the value of @xmath248 is less than the non - interacting one .",
    "this is due to the fact that by introducing interaction the number of microscopic states accessible to the same macroscopic state is reduced ( i.e. , the entropy per site ) whereas the susceptibility is increased by incipient localization effects .    in order to obtain a better understanding of how the thermodynamics of an electronic liquid is modified by the interaction ,",
    "we have performed a study of non - interacting hubbard model ( i.e. @xmath250 ) .",
    "what we learn from the study of this model is that the critical value ( i.e. half - filling ) above which the entropy looks a decreasing function of the filling is uniquely fixed by the statistics .",
    "the temperature has no role . on the contrary , in the interacting case",
    "the energy scale of charge configurations has a crucial role in the region of particle concentration between @xmath218 and half - filling . for @xmath251",
    "there is a critical temperature @xmath222 , depending on the filling , above which the behavior is similar to the non - interacting case [ i.e. where @xmath252 becomes positive , or where @xmath253 becomes negative ] .",
    "we now consider the physical origin of these results . in the non - interacting case",
    "the combinatorics dictated by the fermi statistics governs the behavior of the entropy .",
    "this can be understood if we think that for the single - site problem the entropy has the values 0 , @xmath254 and 0 for occupancy 0 , 1 and 2 , respectively . in the interacting case it is natural to look for a critical value of the filling above which the number of permutations satisfying the restrictions of the boundary conditions starts to decrease . for @xmath251 , because of the coulomb interaction , by increasing the particle density the number of microscopic realizations , accessible to the same observable macroscopic state , decreases [ the pauli principle is obviously crucial for a correct counting ] .",
    "this is true only if the thermal excitations do not exceed the energy scale fixed by the interaction .",
    "definitely , for @xmath255 we have a sort of disordered non - interacting state with @xmath256 , whereas for @xmath251 the low - lying excitations characterize a far from random spatial pattern [ i.e. @xmath257 .",
    "in the range @xmath251 incommensurate magnetism and superconductivity are experimentally observed [ 12 , 70 ] .",
    "the 2d single - band hubbard model has been studied by means of the composite operator method . by considering the hubbard operators as basic set of fields , which describe interatomic excitations restricted to subsets of the occupancy number ,",
    "the single - particle electronic propagator has been computed in a fully self - consistent way by means of a quasi - particle scheme capable of coherently integrating dynamics , boundary conditions and symmetry principles .",
    "the paper was devoted to the study of the electronic specific heat and entropy per site in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "we analyzed these quantities by looking at the dependence of the thermodynamic variables on their conjugate ones , that is , for example , the relation between entropy and temperature , chemical potential and particle concentration , double occupancy and on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "once the self - consistent equations for the single - particle propagator have been solved , we have determined the temperature derivatives of the internal parameters by means of exact linear systems of algebraic equations .",
    "the determination of the first and second temperature derivatives of the chemical potential has been revealed crucial in determining the thermodynamic response functions under investigation . for the electronic specific heat and internal energy",
    "we have presented three different schemes of calculation .",
    "all of them allowed the possibility to obtain a deep theoretical understanding of how and to which extent collective excitations can be retained in the description of thermal response functions .",
    "we have obtained a good agreement with the data by quantum monte carlo techniques for the electronic specific heat and the internal energy [ 34 ] .",
    "further on , although monte carlo data shared common features with the results from the calculations through the t - derivative of the chemical potential , the experimental data for cuprates , as revealed by the wilson ratio and linear coefficient of the electronic specific heat , have shown that in such systems the dominant excitations are those of conventional non - interacting fermions [ 38 ] .",
    "we obtained several characteristic crossing points for the response functions when reported as functions of some thermodynamic variables .",
    "these peculiar features , already evidenced by vollhardt [ 42 ] , marked turning points where different response functions evolve from a non - interacting behaviour                          before closing we would like to mention that the region of filling , where ( vi)-(x ) hold , coincides with that where incommensurate magnetism and superconductivity are experimentally observed in lsco cuprates family .",
