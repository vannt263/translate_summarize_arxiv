    "observations of exoplanetary transits are a powerful tool to investigate the nature of planets around other stars .",
    "transits are revealed through periodic drops in the apparent stellar brightness , due to the interposition of a planet between the star and the observer .",
    "the shape of an exoplanetary transit lightcurve depends on the geometry of the star - planet - observer system and the spatial distribution of the stellar emission at the wavelength at which observations are taken @xcite . by solving the inverse problem",
    ", it is possible to characterise fully the planet s orbit ( period , @xmath3 ; semimajor axis , @xmath4 ; inclination , @xmath5 ; eccentricity , @xmath6 ; and argument of periastron , @xmath7 ) , and to measure its radius , @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the inclination enables determination of the mass of the planet , @xmath9 , if @xmath10 is known from radial - velocity measurements .",
    "multiwavelength transit observations can be used to characterise the atmospheres of exoplanets , through differences in the transit depths , typically at the level of one part in @xmath11 in stellar flux for giant planets @xcite . for this purpose ,",
    "the diagnostic parameter is the wavelength - dependent factor @xmath12 , i.e. the ratio between the planetary and the stellar radii ( or its square , related to the transit depth ) .",
    "the exoplanet hd189733b is one of the most extensively studied hot jupiters : the brightness of its star allows spectroscopic characterisation of the planet s atmosphere .    the 3.6@xmath0 m transit depth for the exoplanet hd189733b has been debated in the literature .",
    "different analyses of the same dataset , including two simultaneous spitzer / irac observations at 3.6@xmath0 m and 5.8@xmath0 m , have been used to infer the presence of water vapour in the atmosphere of hd189733b @xcite , or to reject this hypothesis @xcite .",
    "another analysis of this dataset is reported by @xcite , but we do not comment further their results , as they were not conclusive , because of the very large error bars . @xcite reported the analysis of a second spitzer / irac dataset at 3.6@xmath0 m using the same techniques .",
    "their new estimates of the planet s parameters were significantly different from those reported previously by the same authors @xcite ; the discrepancies were attributed by the authors to variations in the star .",
    "although stellar activity may significantly affect estimates of exoplanetary parameters from transit lightcurves @xcite , the method used to retrieve the signal of the planet also plays a critical role .",
    "the analyses mentioned above were all based on parametric corrections of the instrumental systematics , and are thus , to some degree , subjective .",
    "recently , non - parametric methods have been proposed to decorrelate the transit signals from the astrophysical and instrumental noise , and ensure a higher degree of objectivity .",
    "@xcite suggested algorithms based on independent component analysis ( ica ) to extract information of an exoplanetary atmosphere from hubble / nicmos and spitzer / irs spectrophotometric datasets .    in this paper",
    "we adopt a similar approach to detrend the transit signal from photometric observations by using point spread functions ( psfs ) covering multiple pixels on the detector .",
    "we apply this technique to re - analyse the two observations of primary transits of hd189733b recorded with spitzer / irac at 3.6@xmath0 m ( channel 1 of irac ) in the `` cold spitzer '' era .",
    "we present a series of tests to assess the robustness of the method and the error bars of the parameters estimated .",
    "critically , by comparing the results obtained for the two measurements , we discuss the level of repeatibility of transit measurements in the ir , limited by the absolute photometric accuracy of the instrument and possible stellar activity effects .",
    "we discuss the reliability of our results for orbital and stellar parameters in the light of previous multiple 8@xmath0 m observations @xcite .",
    "the two spitzer observations of hd189733 b discussed here were performed on 2006 october 31 ( i d 30590 ) , and 2007 november 25 ( i d 40732 ) .",
    "the first observation consists of 1936 exposures using irac s stellar mode ( full - array ) , taken over 4.5 hr ; 1.8 hr on the primary transit of the planet , 1.6 hr before , and 1.1 hr after transit .",
    "the reset time is 8.4 s. during the observation , the centroid of the star hd189733 was stable to within one pixel .",
    "the second observation was of 1920 exposures using irac s sub - array mode , over 4.5 hr ; 1.8 hr were spent on the primary transit of the planet , 1.7 hr before , and 1 hr after transit .",
    "the interval between consecutive exposures is 8.4 s. each exposure consists of 64 reads at high speed cadence of 0.1 s. only for the observation i d 40732 , we replaced the 64 reads of each exposure with their mean values , in order to have a manageable number of data points , to reduce the random scatter , and to have the same sampling of the observation i d 30590 . during the observation ,",
    "the centroid of the star hd189733 was again stable to within one pixel",
    ". +      independent component analysis ( ica ) consists of a transformation from a set of recorded signals to an equivalent set of maximally independent components .",
    "the underlying assumptions are that :    1 .",
    "each recorded signal is a linear combination of the same source signals ; 2 .",
    "the source signals are mutually independent",
    ".    we can express this model as : @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , are the recorded signals , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , are the source signals , and @xmath18 are numerical coefficients .",
    "[ eqn : ica_system ] can be written in matrix form as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the column vector containing the recorded signals , @xmath21 is the column vector containing the source signals , and @xmath22 is the matrix of the coefficients , the so - called `` mixing matrix '' .",
    "the aim of ica is the ` blind ' separation of the source signals from the observations , i.e. , without any additional information ( except the assumed mutual independence of the source signals ) . in other words , the ica algorithms search for the matrix @xmath23 that transforms the recorded signals such that the mutual statistical independence is maximised : @xmath24 if the assumptions are valid , then @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a diagonal matrix , so that : @xmath27 the diagonal matrix @xmath26 means that the extracted signals can be rescaled without changing the mutual independence .",
    "+ to maximise said independence , several approaches and implementations have been proposed @xcite .",
    "we used the multicombi algorithm @xcite , which optimally mixes efica and wasobi , based on maximising the nongaussianity of the extracted signals @xcite , and their temporal decorrelations @xcite , respectively .    in this work ,",
    "the observed signals are lightcurves of a star , recorded for a time interval that includes an exoplanetary transit event .",
    "these lightcurves contain at least three independent contributing signals :    * the astrophysical signal ; * the signal of instrumental systematics ; * stochastic noise .",
    "it is possible , in principle , to decompose further the astrophysical and instrumental systematics signals .",
    "the former is the sum of the transit signal , the astrophysical background , possible stellar activity signals , etc . ; the latter is the sum of different effects from different parts of the instrumentation .",
    "all these signals are expected to be independent from each other as they have different origins . by contrast , their linear combinations ( i.e. the observed lightcurves ) are clearly not mutually independent .",
    "it is worth stressing that to disentangle effectively all these signals we need , at least , the number of available lightcurves to be equal to the number of signals .",
    "therefore , we need lightcurves recorded with the same instrument ( since lightcurves recorded with different instruments have different systematics plus the astrophysical signals , so that the number of source signals is greater than the number of lightcurves ) . in principle , using lightcurves recorded at different times with the same instruments should not work , since the systematics have the same origins ; but the relevant signals are not necessarily in phase , and so may differ by more than a simple scaling factor .",
    "additionally , further differences might be present due to stellar variability .",
    "however , the transit signal , being common to all the lightcurves , is potentially detrendable .",
    "a successful extraction of a transit signal from a time series spanning several exoplanetary transit events , conveniently split into sub - lightcurves , is described in @xcite .",
    "+ the advantage of spectroscopic observations over photometry is the provision of simultaneous lightcurves at different wavelengths with largely common instrumental systematics . the transit signals at each wavelength can be obtained by subtracting proper systematics models from the lightcurves ( an accurate direct extraction of the transit is impossible due to the limb darkening effect ) . by using this technique , @xcite",
    "have extracted an infrared transmission spectrum of hd189733b between 1.51 @xmath0 m and 2.43 @xmath0 m , from a hubble / nicmos dataset .",
    "the main novelty of the algorithms we use here is their ability to detrend the transit signal from a single photometric observation of just one primary transit .",
    "this is possible because , even if stars can be approximated by point sources , the instrument is purposely de - focused to spread the psf over several detector pixels , and the position of the target star on the detectors is stable to within one pixel . during an observation , there are several pixels detecting the same astrophysical signals at any time , but with different scaling factors , depending on their received flux , their quantum efficiency , and the instrument psf . + we performed an ica decomposition over several pixel - lightcurves , i.e. the time series from individual pixels , in order to extract the transit signal and other independent signal components ( stellar or instrumental in nature ) .",
    "+ once a set of independent components has been obtained from a selected set of pixel - lightcurves , different approaches to obtain the transit signal can be considered .    _ : direct identification of the transit component _ + in principle , if one of the independent components extracted has the morphology of the transit signal , we assume that one to be the transit signal , multiplied by an undetermined scaling factor .",
    "we renormalise the signal by the mean value calculated on the out - of - transit part , so that the out - of - transit level is unity .",
    "+ method 1 is not applicable to the extraction of accurate transit signals from spectroscopically resolved observations of a primary transit at different wavelengths , because of the wavelength dependence of stellar limb darkening .",
    "this is not a problem in our case , because all the pixels record the same wavelengths .",
    "+ _ : non - transit - components subtraction _ + another approach to estimating the transit signal is to remove all the other effects from an observed lightcurve , i.e. by subtracting all the components other than the transit one , properly scaled .",
    "the scaling factors can be determined by fitting a linear combination of the components , plus a constant term , to the out - of - transit part of the lightcurve .",
    "the coefficients of the linear combination and the constant are the free parameters to fit .",
    "+ instead of fitting the non - transit - components on the pixel - lightcurves , and then subtracting , we performed these processes on the spatially integrated lightcurves , obtained by summing all the individual pixel - lightcurves . the integrated lightcurves are much less noisy than the individual pixel - curves",
    ". +      after the extractions of the detrended and normalised transit time series , we modelled them by using the @xcite analytical formulae .",
    "we can compute the observed flux as a function @xmath28 , where @xmath12 is the ratio between the planetary and the stellar radii , and @xmath29 is the distance between the centres of their disks projected onto the sky divided by the stellar radius .",
    "the relative distance @xmath30 is a function of time , determined by the orbital parameters .",
    "+ we assumed the orbital period @xmath3 , zero eccentricity , and a quadratic limb darkening model @xcite .",
    "the values of the fixed parameters are reported in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] .",

    "recent papers @xcite report a small but non - zero eccentricity ( @xmath37 ) , but we verified this would affect our estimates of the other parameters by a negligible fraction of their error bars .",
    "+ we then performed a fit with three free parameters :    1 .   the ratio of planetary to stellar radii , @xmath38 ; 2 .   the orbital semimajor axis ( in units of the stellar radius ) , @xmath39 ; 3 .   the orbital inclination , @xmath5 .",
    "we chose these as free parameters , because :    * there is a large range of values published in the literature ; * they largely determine the shape of the transit signal ; * they do not show strong cross - correlations .    for completeness , and for comparisons with the literature , in the final results",
    "we report also the transit depth , @xmath40 , the impact parameter , @xmath41 , and the duration of the transit , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 @xmath44    we used a nelder - mead optimisation algorithm @xcite , to obtain first estimates of the parameters of a model .",
    "to confirm / improve these estimates and to determine error bars , we ran an adaptive metropolis algorithm with delayed rejection @xcite for 20,000 iterations , starting from the optimal values initially determined , in order to sample the probability distributions of the fitted parameters .",
    "the updated best estimates and error bars of the parameters are the means and the standard deviations of the sampled distributions ( approximately gaussians ) , respectively . no burn - in",
    "is required , because of the optimal starting points of the chains .",
    "+ the variance of the likelihood function is initialised as the variance of the residuals obtained for the first model and then sampled together with the other free parameters ( @xmath45 ) . in this way , we take into account both white and the autocorrelated noise present in the detrended time series , but we ignore possible systematic errors due to the preliminary ica deconvolution .",
    "the ica errors can be represented as an additional uncertainty , @xmath46 , on each point in the time series .",
    "the likelihood s variance , @xmath47 , becomes : @xmath48 we tested that resampling the parameters chains with @xmath47 does not affect their best values , while the total error bars of the single parameters , @xmath49 , increase with respect to the previous estimates ( without the ica errors ) , @xmath50 , as : @xmath51 a measure of the uncertainties on the independent components extracted by ica is given by the interference - to - signal - ratio matrix , @xmath52 , i.e. a @xmath53 matrix , where @xmath54 is the number of signals .",
    "the @xmath55 element estimates the relative remaining presence of the @xmath56 component in the @xmath57 one .",
    "then , @xmath58 estimates the relative remaining presence of all the other components in the @xmath57 one .",
    "+ if the @xmath57 component represents the transit signal , and if we estimate the transit signal through _ method 1 _ , we can identify : @xmath59 @xmath60 being the scaling factor used .",
    "+ if the @xmath57 component represents the transit signal , but we estimate it through _ method 2 _ , @xmath46 has to contain a weighted sum of the * * isr**s of the non - transit components removed , plus the discrepancies of the fit to the out - of - transit phases : @xmath61 @xmath62 being the coefficients of the non - transit components , @xmath63 the number of components considered , @xmath64 the standard deviation of the residuals from the reference lightcurve ( out of the transit ) , and @xmath60 the normalising factor for the model - subtracted lightcurve .",
    "+ the multicombi code produces two interference - to - signal - ratio matrices , @xmath65 , associated with the algorithm efica , and the @xmath66 , associated with the algorithm wasobi .",
    "we estimated the global @xmath52 as their average : @xmath67 this is a conservative estimate , given that , according to @xcite , the multicombi @xmath52 slightly outperforms the best of @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( then it could be smaller ) , but these estimates are entirely reliable only under certain assumptions on the signals which may be not satisfied in these cases .",
    "here we take them as worst - case estimates .      here",
    ", we describe the main steps of the analyses performed on each of the two observations ( i d 30590 and i d 40732 ) , which include some tests of robustness .",
    "we now discuss only results obtained with method 2 , as they are much more stable ; results obtained with method 1 are reported in appendix [ sec : app2 ] , along with a critical comparison of the two methods .",
    "the first step in the analysis is the choice of the pixel - lightcurves to analyse .",
    "this is determined by :    * the instrument point response function ( prf ) , i.e. the measured intensity profile of the star on the detector ; * the noise level of the detector ; * the effective number of significant components to disentangle .",
    "the number of significant components is not known a priori .",
    "the ica code extracts a number of components equal to the number of lightcurves that it receives as input .",
    "apart from the collective behaviour common to all the pixel - lightcurves , each pixel introduces an individual signature .",
    "only if the individual signatures are negligible compared to the collective behaviour are we able to select enough lightcurves to disentangle the significant components .",
    "the prf and the noise level of the detector limit the number of pixels containing potentially useful astrophysical information .    in practice",

    "[ fig1 ] shows the `` integral lightcurves '' , obtained by summing the contributions from the various pixels .",

    "we found only one outlier in observation i d 30590 , and nine in i d 40732 .",
    "although the observed lightcurves are two primary transits of the same exoplanet , observed at the same wavelength through the same instrument , they appear very different , mainly because of the different observing strategies .",
    "in particular , observation i d 40732 seems to be much less affected by systematics , and less noisy .",
    "the integral lightcurves from the various arrays of pixels look very similar in shape , but have different absolute intensities , as expected .",

    "we are not interested in absolute photometry , but only in relative variations of the intensity , therefore it is not important whether the prf is totally contained in the square used for the analysis or not , provided it contains enough information to detrend the transit signal .",
    "larger arrays include pixels which add noise with little or no astrophysical information .",
    "we concluded that the @xmath68 or the @xmath69 arrays were the optimal choices .",

    "the best values of @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath5 are stable , within the error bars , with respect to the choice of the set of pixel - lightcurves used to detrend the signals .",
    "the discrepancies between the extracted signals and the relative fits are the biggest for the @xmath68 array ; for larger arrays they are smaller , and are either all at the same level ( i d 30590 ) , or slightly decrease with the size of the array ( i d 40732 ) .",
    "our interpretation of this is that the @xmath69 and larger arrays contain the same amount of useful information , while in the @xmath68 array something is missed .",

    "our results are consistent , at @xmath124 level , with those of @xcite , @xcite for i d 30590 , and @xcite for i d 40732 .",
    "however , our results afford a substantial agreement ( within 1@xmath73 ) between the transit parameters determined from the two observations , while previous analyses by @xcite and @xcite claimed significant variations of all parameters ( e.g. , discrepancy @xmath125 for transit depths ) .",
    "@xcite suggested stellar activity as a possible explanations for those differences .",
    "our results do not support such conclusions , and we find that any possible stellar - activity variations are within the error bars .",
    "our error bars from the observation i d 40732 are of the same order ( for transit depth ) or even smaller ( for orbital parameters ) than in @xcite , while those from the observation i d 30590 are larger by a factor @xmath126 with respect to the error bars in @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath126 comes from adding the ica errors to the parameter error bars derived from the extracted signals .",
    "@xcite applied parametric corrections to detrend the transit signals from other disturbances , without attributing any uncertainties to the detrending processes .",
    "the fact that we obtained smaller error bars from the observation i d 40732 , even including the contributions from the detrending process , indicates that , in that context , our blind extraction performed better than their parameterisation .",
    "orbital parameters determined by @xcite and @xcite for observation i d 30590 are not consistent with those for observation i d 40732 obtained by @xcite , the results presented here , or the 8@xmath0 m observations by @xcite . given that the second measurement was superior in quality , and given the agreement with observations at another wavelength ,",
    "we conclude that the parameters presented in this paper are more robust than those reported by @xcite , or by @xcite using the same data .",
    "we note that @xcite used the same impact parameter at 3.6@xmath0 m and 5.8@xmath0 m , while @xcite used similar , but not identical , values . given the conclusions obtained in this paper about the orbital parameters , we suggest that the transit depth at 5.8@xmath0 m be recalculated accordingly . a re - analysis of the observation at 5.8@xmath0 m , then the differences between the transit depths at the two wavelengths , which were used to infer about the atmosphere of the planet , should not be strongly affected by this bias , at least in the first case .",
    "however , because their conclusions were controversial , a re - analysis of the observation at @xmath127 , with more precise orbital parameters and possibly non parametric technique , as done here , is needed .",
    "we have introduced a blind signal - source separation method , based on ica , to analyse photometric data of transiting exoplanets , with a high degree of objectivity ; a novel aspect is the use of pixel - lightcurves , rather than multiple observations .",
    "+ we have applied the method to a reanalysis of two spitzer / irac datasets at 3.6@xmath0 m , which previous analyses found to give discrepant results , and obtained consistent transit parameters from the two observations .",
    "+ we suggest that the large scatter of results reported in the literature arises from :    * use of arbitrary parametric methods to detrend the transit signals , neglecting the relevant uncertainties ; * correlations between parameters in the lightcurve fit .",
    "we found , for observation i d 40732 , values for the orbital parameters that are in excellent agreement with those found by @xcite , based on spitzer / irac observations at @xmath123 . by applying these values to observation i d 30590 , we improved the accuracy of the inferred transit depth , and strengthened the consistency between the two observations .",
