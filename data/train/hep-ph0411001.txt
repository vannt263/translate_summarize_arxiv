    "recently there has been interest in the structure of matter at extremely high densities , such as might be found in the cores of neutron stars . at large enough densities ,",
    "the nucleons are crushed together and the quarks become the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "the asymptotic freedom of qcd ensures that the theory is weakly coupled at high enough densities .",
    "this allows one to perform weak - coupling calculations at asymptotically high densities .",
    "such calculations have established that the structure of the ground state of quark matter is a colour superconductor ( see for example  @xcite ) . in particular , at densities high enough that the three lightest quarks can be treated as massless , the ground state is the colour - flavour  locked ( cfl ) state in which all three colours and all three flavours participate in maximally ( anti)-symmetric pairing  @xcite .",
    "determination of the qcd phase structure at moderate densities and in the presence of non - zero quark masses has proceeded in several ways .",
    "one approach has been to formulate a chain of effective theories , and then to match coefficients across several energy scales through these effective theories to perturbative calculations .",
    "coefficients in the low - energy chiral effective theory  @xcite are matched to calculations performed in high - density effective theories ( hdet )  @xcite which in turn are matched to weakly - coupled qcd .",
    "this allows one to determine the properties of the goldstone bosons and determine the effects of small quark masses  @xcite . within this framework ,",
    "it has been noted that , in the presence of a finite strange quark mass , neutral `` kaons '' ( the lightest pseudo - goldstone modes at high density with the same quantum numbers as their vacuum counterpart ) can bose - condense in the cfl state to form a kaon - condensed cflk@xmath0 phase with lower condensation energy  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the low - energy effective theory is only reliable for small perturbations and at moderate densities the strange quark mass is not a small perturbation .",
    "a recent attempt has been made to extrapolate to large strange quark mass ( @xmath1 )  @xcite , but this approach has not dealt with additional complications in the condensate structure that allow different gap parameters for each pair of quarks .    to deal with moderate quark masses ,",
    "another approach has been to study nambu ",
    "jona - lasinio ( njl ) models  @xcite of free quarks with contact interactions that model instanton interactions or single gluon exchange .",
    "these models are amenable to a mean - field treatment and exhibit a similar symmetry breaking pattern to qcd which results in cfl ground states  @xcite .    within these models",
    ", one can study the effects of moderate quark masses through self - consistent solutions of the mean - field gap equations .",
    "this has led to a plethora of phases .",
    "in particular , several analyses show a transition to a colour - flavour locked phase with gapless fermionic excitations ( the gcfl phase ) .",
    "these include both njl - based calculations  @xcite and effective - theory  based calculations  @xcite .",
    "until recently , however , the njl calculations have excluded the possibility of kaon condensation ( see however  @xcite which considers kaon condensation in the njl model at low density ) , while the effective theories do not consider the complicated patterns in which the condensate parameters evolve at finite quark masses .",
    "the goal of this paper is to show that one can combine the analysis of the low - energy effective theories , which exhibit kaon condensation , with the self - consistent mean - field analysis of the njl model , which accounts for the full condensate structure . in particular",
    ", we use an njl model based on single gluon exchange to find self - consistent solutions that correspond to the cflk@xmath0 phase ; we show that these phases agree with the predictions of the low - energy effective theory ; and we determine how and where the zero temperature phase transition to a gapless cfl phase occurs as one increases the strange quark mass . in addition , unlike previous work on the njl model , our numerical solutions are _ fully _ self - consistent : we include _ all _ condensates and self - energy corrections required to close the gap equations .",
    "we first describe the pattern of symmetry breaking that leads to the cfl and cflk@xmath0 states ( section  [ sec : colo - flav - lock ] )",
    ". then we present our numerical results , demonstrating some properties of these states and determining the locations of the zero - temperature phase transitions ( section  [ sec : self - cons - solut ] ) . after a careful description of our model ( section  [ sec : njl - model ] ) we derive the low - energy effective theory , paying particular attention to the differences between qcd and the njl model ( section  [ sec : low - energy - effective ] ) . here",
    "we demonstrate that , for small perturbations , our numerical solutions are well described by the effective theory , and we use our numerical results to compute the pion decay constant @xmath2 which agrees with the perturbative qcd results .",
    "specific numerical details about our calculations and a full description of our self - consistent parametrization are given in appendix  [ sec : full - param ] .",
    "we leave for future work the consideration of finite temperature effects , the analysis of the gapless cflk@xmath0 ( gcflk@xmath0 ) , the inclusion of instanton effects , the inclusion of up and down quark mass effects , and the possibility of other forms of meson condensation .",
    "qcd has a continuous symmetry group of u@xmath3 . in addition",
    ", there is an approximate u@xmath4 axial flavour symmetry that is explicitly broken by anomalies . at sufficiently high densities ,",
    "however , the instanton density is suppressed and this symmetry is approximately restored .",
    "the cfl ground state spontaneously breaks these continuous symmetries through the formation of a diquark condensate  @xcite @xmath5 the symmetry breaking pattern ( including the restored axial u@xmath4 symmetry ) is thus factor mods out the common centres .",
    "see  ( [ eq : explicitsym ] ) for the explicit representation . ]",
    "@xmath6 where the @xmath7 symmetries correspond to @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "it has been noted that the symmetry breaking pattern at high density  ( [ eq : ssb ] ) is the same as that that for hyper - nuclear matter at low density  @xcite .",
    "this leads one to identify the low - energy pseudo - scalar degrees of freedom in both theories .",
    "we shall refer to the pseudo - scalar goldstone bosons in the high - density phase as `` pions '' and `` kaons '' etc .",
    "when they have the same flavour quantum numbers as the corresponding low - density particles .    the cfl state  ( [ eq : diquark ] ) preserves parity , and is preferred when instanton effects are considered . excluding instanton effects , there is an uncountable degeneracy of physically equivalent cfl ground states that violate parity .",
    "these are generated from the parity even cfl by the broken symmetry generators .",
    "the symmetry breaking pattern  ( [ eq : ssb ] ) breaks @xmath10 generators .",
    "the quarks , however , are coupled to the eight gluons associated with the su@xmath11 colour symmetry and to the photon of the u@xmath12 electromagnetism ( which is a subgroup of the vector flavour symmetry ) .",
    "eight of these gauge bosons acquire a mass through the higgs mechanism and the coloured excitations are lifted from the low - energy spectrum",
    ". there remain @xmath13 massless nambu - goldstone excitations : a pseudo - scalar axial flavour octet of mesons , a scalar superfluid boson associated with the broken u@xmath14 baryon number generator , and a pseudo - scalar @xmath15 boson associated with broken axial u@xmath4 generator .",
    "there remains one massless gauge boson that is a mixture of the original photon and one of the gluons  @xcite .",
    "with respect to this `` rotated electromagnetism '' u@xmath16 the cfl state remains neutral  @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy of the vacuum manifold is lifted by the inclusion of a non - zero strange quark mass @xmath1 . in the absence of instanton effects and other quark masses ,",
    "the ground state is not near to the parity even cfl state  ( [ eq : diquark ] ) , but rather , is a kaon rotated state cflk@xmath17 . as @xmath18",
    "this state approaches a state on the vacuum manifold that is a pure kaon rotation of the parity even cfl  ( [ eq : diquark ] ) .    even in the absence of quark masses ,",
    "the vacuum manifold degeneracy is partially lifted by the anomalous breaking of the u@xmath4 axial symmetry which we have neglected : instanton effects tend to disfavour kaon condensation by favouring parity even states , and thus delay the onset of the cflk@xmath17 until @xmath1 reaches a critical value ( possibly excluding it ) .",
    "the effects of anomaly and instanton contributions have been well studied  @xcite and play an important quantitative role in the phase structure of qcd .",
    "non - zero up and down quark masses also tend to disfavour kaon condensation .    for the purposes of this paper , we shall neglect both the effects of instantons , and the effects of finite up and down quark masses .",
    "this will ensure that kaon condensation occurs for arbitrarily small @xmath1 .",
    "both of these effects open the possibility of a much richer phase structure , including condensation of other mesons ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "future analyses should take these numerically important effects into account , both in the effective theory and in the njl model .",
    "the primary source of for kaon condensation is the finite strange quark mass . to lowest - order",
    ", this behaves as a chemical potential  @xcite ( see ( [ eq : ms = muy1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ms = muy2 ] ) ) . in this paper",
    ", we also consider the addition of a hypercharge chemical potential as this removes many complications associated with masses and leads to a very clean demonstration of kaon condensation .",
