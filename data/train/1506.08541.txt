    "a @xmath0-dimensional random walk that proceeds via a sequence of unit - length steps , each in an independent and uniformly random direction , is sometimes called a _ pearson  rayleigh _ random walk ( prrw ) , after the exchange in the letters pages of _ nature _ between karl pearson and lord rayleigh in 1905 @xcite .",
    "pearson was interested in two dimensions and questions of migration of species ( such as mosquitoes ) @xcite , although carazza has speculated that pearson was a golfer @xcite ; rayleigh had earlier considered the acoustic ` random walks ' in phase space produced by combinations of sound waves of the same amplitude and random phases .",
    "the prrw can be represented via partial sums of sequences of i.i.d .",
    "random vectors that are uniformly distributed on the unit sphere @xmath4 in @xmath5 .",
    "clearly the increments have mean zero , i.e. , the prrw has _",
    "zero drift_. the prrw has received some renewed interest recently as a model for microbe locomotion @xcite .",
    "chapter 2 of @xcite gives a general discussion of these walks , which have been well - understood for many years .",
    "in particular , it is well known that the prrw is recurrent for @xmath6 and transient if @xmath2 .",
    "suppose that we replace the spherically symmetric increments of the prrw by increments that instead have some _ elliptical _ structure , while retaining the zero drift .",
    "for example , one could take the increments to be uniformly distributed on the surface of an ellipsoid of fixed shape and orientation , as represented by the picture on the right of figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "more generally , one should view the ellipses in figure  [ fig1 ] as representing the _ covariance _ structure of the increments of the walk ( we will give a concrete example later ; the uniform distribution on the ellipse is actually not the most convenient for calculations ) .",

    "it is necessary to abandon spatial homogeneity .    in this paper",
    "we consider a family of spatially _ non - homogeneous _ random walks with zero drift .",
    "these include generalizations of the prrw in which the increments are not i.i.d .  but have a distribution supported on an ellipsoid of fixed size and shape but whose orientation depends upon the current position of the walk .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] gives representations of two important types of example , in which the ellipsoid is aligned so that its principal axes are parallel or perpendicular to the vector of the current position of the walk , which sits at the centre of the ellipse .",

    "these modified walks can behave very differently to the prrw .",
    "for instance , one of the two - dimensional random walks represented in figure  [ fig2 ] is _ transient _ while the other ( as in the classical case ) is recurrent .",
    "the reader who has not seen this kind of example before may take a moment to identify which is which .",
    "it is this _ anomalous recurrence behaviour _ that is the main subject of the present paper . in the next section ,",
    "we give a formal description of our model and state our main results .",
    "we end this introduction with a brief comment on motivation . in biology , the prrw is more natural than a lattice - based walk for modelling the motion of microscopic organisms , such as certain bacteria , on a surface .",
    "experiment suggests that the locomotion of several kinds of cells consists of roughly straight line segments linked by discrete changes in direction : see , e.g. ,  @xcite . the generalization to elliptically - distributed increments studied here represents movement on a surface on which either radial or transverse motion is inhibited . in chemistry and physics",
    ", the trajectory of a finite - step prrw ( also called a ` random chain ' ) is an idealized model of the growth of weakly interacting polymer molecules : see , e.g. ,   2.6 of @xcite .",

    "the fact ensures that questions of the escape of trajectories to infinity are non - trivial .",
    "indeed , we will give conditions under which one or other of the following two behaviours ( which are not _ a priori _ exhaustive ) occurs :    * @xmath49 , a.s .",

    "although certainly appreciated by experts , this fact is perhaps not as widely known as it might be .",
    "zeitouni ( pp .  9192 of @xcite ) describes an example of a transient zero - drift random walk on @xmath54 , and states that the idea `` goes back to krylov ( in the context of diffusions ) '' .",

    "note that and together imply that @xmath62 ; next we impose a key assumption on the form of @xmath57 that is considerably stronger . to describe this , it is convenient to introduce the notation @xmath63 that defines , for each @xmath46 , an inner product on @xmath5 via @xmath64    : :    suppose that there exist constants @xmath65 and @xmath66    with @xmath67 such that , for all    @xmath46 ,    @xmath68    informally , @xmath66 quantifies the total variance of the increments , while @xmath65 quantifies the variance in the radial direction ; necessarily @xmath69 . the assumption that @xmath70 excludes some degenerate cases . as we will see , one possible way to satisfy condition is to suppose that the eigenvectors of @xmath71 are all parallel or perpendicular to the vector @xmath72 , and that the corresponding eigenvalues are all constant as @xmath72 varies ; the level sets of the corresponding quadratic forms @xmath73 for @xmath46 are then ellipsoids like those depicted in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "our main result is the following , which shows that both transience and recurrence are possible for _ any _ @xmath3 , depending on parameter choices ; as seen in theorem  [ t : zero_drift_implies_recurrence ] , this possibility of anomalous recurrence behaviour is a genuinely multidimensional phenomenon under our regularity conditions .",

    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : ell - rws ] we describe a specific family of examples called _ elliptic random walk models _ that satisfy assumptions  and exhibit both transient and recurrent behaviour dependent on the parameters of the model .",
    "we also present some simulated data that depicts the random walks in both cases . in section  [ sec : non - confinement ] we prove a @xmath0-dimensional martingale version of kolmogorov s other inequality and use that to prove the non - confinement result ( proposition  [ lem : lim_sup_infty ] ) . in section  [ sec : rw ] we prove the recurrence classification ( theorem  [ thm : recurrence ] ) , and in section  [ sec : nullity ] we prove theorem  [ thm : null ] . in the appendix we prove recurrence in the one - dimensional case ( theorem  [ t : zero_drift_implies_recurrence ] ) .",
    "finally , we remark that in work in progress we investigate diffusive scaling limits for random walks of the type described in the present paper ; the diffusions that appear as scaling limits possess certain pathologies from the point of view of diffusion theory that make them interesting in their own right .",
