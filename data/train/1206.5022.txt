    "the notion of agn as an astronomical object of solar system dimensions and luminosity surpassing that of a galaxy has been with us for about half a century now . since then ,",
    "the advent of novel observational techniques , the accumulation of data and theoretical modeling has refined and advanced our notions as to what constitutes an agn , with accretion onto a black hole as the source of the observed radiation now being universally accepted . at the same time , the discovery of galactic bright x - ray binary ( xrb ) sources , powered also by accretion onto compact objects ( neutron stars and stellar size black holes ) has extended the notion of accretion powered source to the stellar domain .",
    "indeed , the general similarity of the x - ray spectral properties of agn and galactic black hole candidates ( gbhc ) and xrbs in general , including their broad fe fluorescence features @xcite , argues for near horizon structures which are very similar , despite the huge disparity in the objects scales .",
    "this structure is thought to consist of a shakura - sunyaev @xcite disk that extends to the isco ( innermost stable circular orbit ) of the corresponding flow , supplemented by an overlying hot , x - ray emitting corona .",
    "even though it is generally accepted that the agn radiant energy is released by the accretion of matter onto a black hole ( or in certain cases by extraction of the hole s rotational energy ) in a region comparable to its horizon , there is plenty of evidence that a significant fraction of the agn power is emitted , after reprocessing , at much larger radii .",
    "[ one should note however , that accretion energy can also be transported outward not only radiatively but also mechanically by the viscous stresses that transport the accretion flow s angular momentum @xcite ] .",
    "thus , the uv and optical lines that constitute , typically , a fraction @xmath3 of the agn bolometric luminosity , are emitted presumably by clouds at distances @xmath4 pc that cover a fraction @xmath5 of the agn solid angle .",
    "in addition to the line emission , the agn ionizing continuum is also reprocessed into ir and far  ir radiation by matter at even larger distances , which apparently subtends an even larger fraction of the agn solid angle ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the geometry of this component is thought to be cylindrical ( rather than spherical ) with a column density that depends strongly on the angle @xmath1 of the observers line of sight ( los ) with the symmetry axis .",
    "it was proposed that such a geometry nicely unifies the seyfert-1 and seyfert-2 agn subclasses @xcite and also those of the broad and narrow line radio galaxies ( blrg - nlrg ) @xcite , according to the angle @xmath1 : thus , seyfert-1s ( or blrg ) are agn in which the observer s los makes a small angle with their axis of symmetry , the column of the intervening cold gas is small ( @xmath7 ) and the continuum source and its surrounding broad line emission ( concentrated in the inner agn regions ) are directly visible .",
    "seyfert-2s ( or nlrg ) on the other hand , represent the same objects viewed at a large inclination angle , along which the column density to the source is much larger ( @xmath8 ) , obscuring the continuum source and allowing the view of only the large distance ( hence narrow component ) of the emission lines .",
    "this obscuring structure is referred to as the  agn molecular torus \" , considering that it must consist of gas in molecular state , given its low effective temperature ( @xmath9 k ) .",
    "statistics of seyfert-1 and seyfert-2 agn imply that the height @xmath10 of these torii must be comparable to their distance @xmath11 from the agn center , i.e. @xmath12 .",
    "however , the value of this ratio is in conflict with that implied by hydrostatic equilibrium and the ratio of their thermal ( @xmath13 km / s ) and keplerian ( @xmath14 km / s ) velocities , namely @xmath15 , thus presenting us with a conundrum concerning the physics of these structures",
    ".    these spectroscopically inferred components , along with observations of narrow radio jets along the agn symmetry axis , led to the now well known agn picture of @xcite , which consists simply of their arrangement at the appropriate positions in the agn vicinity . compelling as this picture might be observationally , it includes very little , if any , of the underlying physics .",
    "the agn constituent components are independent of each other with physical properties assigned as needed by the observations of the specific objects . however , more recent observational developments suggest that such a picture is rather incomplete . to begin with ,",
    "@xcite have shown the existence of interrelations among agn the line properties and also relations to other bands of the spectrum ( notably the x - rays ) .",
    "then , the increase in uv spectral resolution afforded by _",
    "hst _ has shown that roughly 50% of seyfert-1s exhibit uv absorption troughs due to plasma outflowing at @xmath16 km / s , too narrow to have been discerned by the earlier _ iue _ observations @xcite , which did detect some , but in a much smaller fraction of the overall agn population . to these flows",
    "one must also include those of the so - called bal qsos , which reach velocities along the observer s los in excess of @xmath17 km / s @xcite .",
    "these are observed in about @xmath18 of high luminosity quasars , implying that they subtend a similar fraction of the continuum source solid angle in these objects .",
    "in addition to these uv absorption features , outflowing components were also found in the agn x - ray spectra .",
    "the increase in spectral resolution provided by _ asca",
    "_ showed that approximately @xmath19 of seyfert-1s exhibit also blue - shifted absorption features in their x - ray spectra @xcite , indicative of outflowing plasma , but of different ionization state than that responsible for the uv absorption features .",
    "more recently , @xcite have shown that fe - k absorption features at velocities @xmath20 are rather common in nearby seyfert galaxies and coined for them the term ultra - fast outflows ( ufo ) .",
    "the simultaneous presence of both uv and x - ray absorbers in the same objects implies they belong to the same outflowing plasma ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , despite a large number of studies supporting this hypothesis , @xcite , an understanding of the underlying gas dynamics is lacking . a common origin for the plasma of these components as features of a common , radiatively driven flow would be hard to reconcile with their different velocities and ionization properties .",
    "an account of the observed agn outflows , in particular of the most challenging high velocity ones of bal qsos was put forward semi - analytically by @xcite .",
    "these authors , in analogy with the winds of o - stars , proposed that they are driven off the inner regions of the qso accretion disks by uv and optical line radiation pressure to achieve velocities consistent with those observed . the same issue was taken up in more detail in 2d numerical calculations by @xcite who included in these calculations the detailed photoionization of the line driven wind by the qso x - ray radiation .",
    "as shown in this work , efficient wind driving by line pressure requires that the line driven wind material be shielded from the ionizing effects of the x - rays , otherwise line driving becomes ineffective .",
    "their calculations showed that the  failed wind \" from the highly ionized innermost regions of the agn accretion disk did provide the required shielding .",
    "the fact that bal qsos are weak x - ray emitters appears to advocate for such a point of view .",
    "the ubiquity of agn outflows implies that they should be included in the agn structure schematic of @xcite ; however , the broad range of observed velocities and their different values in the uv and x - ray bands make such a construct complicated in the absences of an underlying unifying principle",
    ". however , such attempts have been made .",
    "thus , @xcite , motivated by the velocity fields produced by @xcite in modeling the bal qso outflows , proposed a scheme that would supplement the agn picture of @xcite with outflow components consistent with observed phenomenology . by limiting the fast ( @xmath21 km / s ) ,",
    "radiatively driven flow to a narrow angular sliver ( @xmath22 ) around @xmath23 @xcite , he accounted for the observed fraction of bal qsos in the overall qso population .",
    "he then attributed the lower velocities of the typical x - ray and uv absorption features to the projection effects of viewing this flow at a larger angle @xmath24 and the absence of absorption features in fraction of the objects to the low column and high ionization of the wind at @xmath25 .",
    "he also postulated that the angular position @xmath26 and the opening angle @xmath27 of the high velocity radiatively driven radial stream would vary with source luminosity in a way that could account the variation of source properties with luminosity . however , his approach ignored the outflows seen in the agn x - ray spectra , which at the time were not as well documented .",
    "the agn picture proposed herein is in the same spirit as that of @xcite in that , employing a well defined wind dynamical model , it provides a framework of systematizing the multitude of observational facts , in particular the more recent high resolution x - ray spectroscopy observations .",
    "however , it does more than that ; it provides , in addition , scaling arguments similar to those put forward by @xcite , which allow one to incorporate within this single framework the ionization properties of seyferts , bal qsos and xrbs , the structure of the agn molecular torii and the corresponding ir spectra .",
    "this is possible because the underlying dynamical models , which span many decades in radius , are to a large extent independent of the mass of the accreting object and , as such , they can be applied to objects over a very wide range of luminosity .",
    "as we will discuss in the ensuing sections , the models we present provide the possibility of a broader classification of the structure of accreting sources in terms of a small number of parameters ( 2 ) thus providing an opportunity for a unified treatment of all accretion powered sources .",
    "the present work will concentrate on the structure of agn , however it will be argued that the structures of xrbs are quite similar , their appearance being different only because of their very different ionization .",
    "in  2 we provide a brief review of agn outflow phenomenology with emphasis on the more recent high spectral resolution observations of x - ray absorbers by _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. in  3 we present our model and its general scalings . in ",
    "4 the model is applied to produce the absorber properties of galactic and extragalactic objects as specific cases of its parameters along with its general structure properties , depicted in two diagrams that relate the absorber column , velocity and observation angle . in  5 we focus on the emission properties of these winds and provide an account of the observed linear relation between the h@xmath28 and bolometric agn luminosities as well as their ir  to  far - ir spectra .",
    "finally in  6 the results are reviewed and directions for future research are outlined .",
    "following the discovery of the ubiquitous nature of x - ray absorption features ( warm absorbers ) in the _ asca _ spectra , the launch of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ ushered a new era in the study of these features . their superior sensitivity and resolution compared with those of previous missions made clear the presence of a plethora of transitions ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) in the spectra of numerous agn .",
    "for example , the x - ray bright qso iras  13349 + 2438 ( @xmath29 ) and the seyfert-1 galaxy ( e.g. mcg-6 - 30 - 15 at @xmath30 ) observed extensively with _ rosat _ @xcite and _ asca _",
    "@xcite gave indications of absorption features in the sub - kev regime .",
    "their _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ spectra confirmed this fact and exhibited a wealth of transitions such as ,  ,  , ,  , and   while successfully identifying almost all charge states of fe and o in some cases ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hbk07 ) .",
    "furthermore , these observations showed the various transitions to be blueshifted relative to the host galaxy , indicating that the warm absorber plasma is , in fact , outflowing .    though the majority of the x - ray absorber features in the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ archives are associated with the spectra of seyfert galaxies , absorption features have been also seen in the spectra of quasars ; these are mainly fe - k features usually at velocities higher than those seen in seyferts , in the range of @xmath31 , suggesting launching of these winds from regions very close to the compact object .",
    "these include both bal [ see @xcite for pg  1115 + 080 , @xcite for h  1413 + 117 , @xcite for apm  08279 + 5255 ; as such these also exhibit high velocity uv absorption features ] as well as non - bal quasars [ see @xcite for pg  0844 + 349 , @xcite for pds  456 , @xcite for pg  1211 + 143 ] .",
    "the columns of these features are @xmath32 @xmath33 which are typically at least @xmath34 times higher than that of uv absorbers @xcite . finally ,",
    "as discussed above , fe - k features at velocities @xmath35 km / s , have been detected in a large fraction ( @xmath36 ) of observed agn .",
    "@xcite refer to these as ultra - fast outflows ( ufo ) .",
    "absorption features of varying ionization states have also been observed in galactic sources ( gbhc , xrb ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "considering that the presence of the ionic species observed in these sources , like in agn , is due to photoionization of an outflow by the photons of the continuum source , their distribution is determined by the photoionization parameter @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the ionizing luminosity , @xmath39 the local gas density and @xmath40 the distance of this gas from the source .",
    "the higher s / n ratios of galactic sources afforded better determination of the velocities of the different ions as well as the densities of the outflowing wind at a given radius @xmath40 .",
    "based on these parameters , it was concluded ( see e.g.  3.1 ) that the wind of gro 1655 - 40 @xcite can not be driven by the radiation pressure or by the x - ray heating of this source and therefore it must be driven by the action of magnetic fields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similar analysis of the x - ray spectra of grs 1915 + 105 by @xcite concluded that the wind mass flux at the outer edge of its accretion disk ( associated with the lowest ionization ions ) could be as much as twenty times larger than the mass flux needed to power the source s x - ray luminosity , while a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite concerning the wind of ngc 3783 .",
    "finally , it should be noted here that the wind velocities of the highest ionization species ( fe - k ) are significantly smaller in gbhc than in seyferts , which in turn are smaller than those of bal qsos , a fact that should be accounted within the general framework of any wind model .",
    "the very detection in the agn x - ray spectra of species of such diverse states of ionization as ,  and  is an important fact in itself .",
    "it implies a wind with density distribution that produces ionic columns , sufficiently large to be detected , for ions that `` live '' at widely different values of @xmath41 and , most likely , also at widely different distances from the ionizing source .",
    "this alone is a significant constraint on outflow models .",
    "taking this argument into consideration , @xcite and subsequently @xcite fit the ensemble of the absorber data in the x - ray spectra of a number of agn with a continuous distribution in @xmath41 ( rather than adding components of different @xmath41 until a sufficiently low @xmath42 is achieved ) . in doing so",
    ", they developed a statistical measure of the plethora of the transitions in the _ chandra / xmm - newton _ x - ray spectra , the absorption measure distribution ( amd ) .",
    "this is the hydrogen equivalent column density of specific ions , @xmath43 , per decade of ionization parameter @xmath41 , as a function of @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath44 . for a monotonic distribution of the wind density @xmath45 with the radius @xmath40 , determination of amd is tantamount to determining the ionized wind s density dependence on @xmath40 ( along the observers los ) .",
    "therefore , considering that @xmath46 , a power law dependence on @xmath41 of the form @xmath47 , implies also a power law dependence for the wind density on @xmath40 i.e. @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "so for @xmath50 ( @xmath51 independent of @xmath41 ) , @xmath52 , consistent with the conclusion reached by @xcite .",
    "as noted in @xcite , an @xmath53 density profile is inconsistent with the asymptotic dependence of a mass conserving spherical wind which obtains @xmath54 and whose ionization parameter  freezes \" to a constant value @xmath55 . on the other hand ,",
    "considering that the velocity of such winds is achieved only asymptotically , with the velocity having the general behavior @xmath56 @xcite , the @xmath51 would exhibit in this case too a dependence on @xmath41 at radii @xmath57 . assuming a mass conserving spherical wind with the above velocity structure , i.e. @xmath58",
    ", one can easily deduce that @xmath59\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the ionization parameter at infinity . under the above velocity field , near @xmath60 , the wind base , @xmath41 ( and also @xmath61 ) approaches zero and the gas column diverges so that @xmath62 . at large distances , with @xmath63 ) , @xmath64 , so that the absorption measure distribution has the form @xmath65 , i.e. the wind column decreases like @xmath66 , as expected .",
    "the arguments leading to the above scalings are certainly overly simple , however they show that for radiatively driven winds , the column _ decreases _ with _ increasing _ ionization and _ increasing _ velocity , in significant disagreement with the dependence found by @xcite and @xcite ; they also suggest that in attempting to account for the amd behavior , one should search for wind models with density and velocity profiles asymptotically different from those driven by radiation pressure .",
    "while it is hard to produce radiation pressure driven winds with the density profile implied by the amd , i.e. @xmath67 ( even an extended source of radiation asymptotically appears point - like and the winds acquire density @xmath54 ) , mhd winds off accretion disks were known to provide such density profiles for some time now ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , cl94 ) .",
    "these are generalizations of the two dimensional mhd winds enunciated by @xcite in that they allow also for mass flux rates which depends on the radius . given that the velocities of these winds asymptotically scale like the disk keplerian velocity at the point of launching , i.e. @xmath68 , one can then easily see that for @xmath69 , @xmath70 , i.e. the wind mass flux @xmath0 increases with distance . in this respect",
    "these winds follow the adios prescription discussed by @xcite .",
    "the specific density profile inferred from the amd is interesting in that it provides equal column per decade of radius . as such ,",
    "it is consistent with the density needed to account for the lags in the power spectra of xrb and agn @xcite in terms of compton scattering .",
    "finally , this same profile for the dust density of agn winds , at radii beyond the dust sublimation radius , was employed by @xcite and @xcite to produce seyfert-2 and qso ir - spectra in agreement with observations .",
    "the fact that this wind density profile can accommodate in a natural way several diverse and independent aspects of agn phenomenology under the same framework is suggestive of its central role in the agn structure and appearance .",
    "motivated by the straightforward interpretation of the amd in terms of density profiles associated with mhd winds , we outline in this section some properties of these wind models with emphasis on their scalings with the black hole mass , mass flux rate and distance .",
    "we pay particular attention on the scalings of the winds ionization and columns , as these are related to the observations of x - ray absorbers .",
    "the mhd winds considered here are launched by accretion disks threaded by poloidal magnetic fields under the combined action of rotation , gravity and magnetic stresses as discussed in @xcite . to simplify the treatment it is assumed that the wind is axisymmetric and as such one need only solve the field geometry and fluid flow in the poloidal ( @xmath71)-plane . to simplify further the problem one looks for solutions separable in @xmath40 and @xmath1 with power law @xmath72dependence for all magnetic field and fluid variables .",
    "after consideration of all conserved quantities in the poloidal plane ( mass flux per magnetic field flux , angular momentum , magnetic line angular velocity and bernoulli integral ) one is left with the force balance in the @xmath73direction ( the so - called grad - safranov equation ) .",
    "the solution of this equation provides the angular dependence of all the fluid and magnetic field variables with their initial values given on the surface of the disk at ( @xmath74 ) , where @xmath75 is a fiducial radius that sets the radial scale of the system and it is of order of the schwarzschild radius , @xmath76 .",
    "the grad - safranov equation has the form of a wind equation with several critical points , the most important of which for our purposes the alfvn point ; this can be crossed by appropriately choosing the flow boundary conditions on the disk surface ( see cl94 , bp82 ) .",
    "the scalings of the magnetic field , velocity , pressure and density are given by @xmath77 the density normalization is given in terms of the poloidal field on the disk @xmath78 , however , it is more instructive to express it in terms of the accretion or wind outflow rate @xmath0 as discussed in fkcb10 ; then the density normalization at the inner edge of the disk at @xmath79 is given on setting @xmath80 by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the ratio of of the mass - outflow rate in the wind to the mass - accretion rate @xmath83 , assumed here to be @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is the thomson cross - section .",
    "it is important to note here that because the mass flux in these winds depends in general on the radius , the normalized parameter used throughout this work , @xmath86 , always refers to the mass flux at the innermost value of the flow radius , i.e. at @xmath87 . with the scalings given above we then have @xmath88 , so for @xmath89 , as inferred from the fits of hbk07 , @xmath90 ( the @xcite solution has @xmath91 , so @xmath92 and therefore @xmath93 or @xmath94 ) .",
    "@xmath95 { density.eps } & \\includegraphics[keepaspectratio = false , width=2.9in , angle=-0 ] { v_los.eps } \\end{array}$ ]      the reason that the winds we present here can be applied to agn as well as to gbhc , as mentioned above , is that winds and flows in general are known to be self - similar when : the radius @xmath40 is normalized to the radius @xmath76 ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 km , where @xmath98 is the mass of the accreting object m in units of the solar mass m@xmath99 ) ; the mass flux @xmath100 is expressed in units of the eddington accretion rate @xmath101 ( @xmath102 is the eddington luminosity , @xmath103 erg s@xmath104 ) as @xmath105 ; their velocities are keplerian , i.e. @xmath106 .    while the wind scalings of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bpol ] ) - ( [ eq : dens ] ) were introduced for the solution of the mhd equations one can write quite general scaling laws that incorporate those of the above equations as special cases .",
    "we do so now both for accretion flows and winds and use them to produce scalings for expressions of the wind density , column density , ionization parameter and amd as a function of the dimensionless radius @xmath107 , the dimensionless mass flux rate @xmath0 and black hole mass @xmath108 .",

    "winds : _ * analogous considerations of similarity apply equally well to winds , given that , generally , their asymptotic velocity , @xmath115 , is proportional to the keplerian velocity at the wind launching radius , @xmath116 , i.e. @xmath117 , with @xmath118 .",
    "so mass conservation in physical and dimensionless units reads respectively @xmath119 with @xmath120 denoting in this case the mass outflow rate in units of the eddington rate @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , the wind density and local column density are given in dimensionless units correspondingly by the expressions ( dropping the subscript @xmath122 from @xmath120 ) @xmath123 with the object mass @xmath108 again dropping out of the expression for the column density @xmath43 . for 1d winds , e.g. stellar winds or winds driven by the intense radiation pressure near a compact object ,",
    "@xmath124 is roughly constant and @xmath125 , i.e. the wind column decreases inversely proportionally to the distance .",
    "however , in the more general case of 2d winds ( e.g. those of bp82 and cl94 ) where the wind is launched from a wide range of radii in an accretion disk with , generally , different mass flux rates at each radius , @xmath126 and @xmath127 and numerically @xmath128 ( it should be understood that @xmath129 have an additional angular dependence discussed in the previous section ) . as noted in @xcite winds with position dependent @xmath0 are the means by which 2d accretion flows dispose of the excess energy and angular momentum transferred _ mechanically _ by the viscous stresses from the smaller to the larger radii , so that finally only a small fraction of the available mass accretes on the compact object ( bb99 ) . for wind density of the form @xmath130 , the mass flow rate varies with @xmath107 like ( bb99 ) @xmath131 with @xmath132 being the mass outflow from the smallest radius @xmath133 ; for @xmath134 and @xmath43 constant per decade of @xmath40 .",

    "this can also be expressed in dimensionless units : if @xmath137 is the radiative efficiency of the accretion process , then the luminosity @xmath38 can be written as @xmath138 ( @xmath139 is the accretion rate that reaches the compact object to produce the luminoisty @xmath38 ) , or @xmath140 in the case of adaf @xcite [ i.e for @xmath141 with @xmath28 the disk viscosity parameter ] , yielding the for @xmath41 an expression also independent of @xmath108 , implying similarity in wind ionization , whether in agn or xrb ( fkcb10 ) @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the ratio of mass flux in wind and accretion at the smallest radii and @xmath144 the index of the density dependence on @xmath40 .",
    "these relations are also independent of @xmath108 , implying a similarity in the ionization structure of winds , whether in agn of any type or gbhc . for a spherical wind , ( @xmath145 )",

    "so , in disks of sufficiently large radial extent , the wind launched at their larger radii will be of sufficiently low ionization and temperature to conform with the properties of the agn unification torus .",
    "finally , one should bear in mind that the above scaling laws do not include the @xmath73dependence of the density and the column density ( see fig .",

    "this leads to much higher ionization of the plasma flowing along the symmetry axis and even smaller neutral absorption column than along the higher column density , less ionized equatorial directions , in agreement with the unification considerations @xcite .    under the above scaling laws , the ionization , velocity and amd of the winds discussed in this work are independent of the mass of the accreting object",
    "therefore these expressions should hold equally well for agn and gbhc or xrb in general , a fact in obvious disagreement with observation , given their very different x - ray absorber properties",
    ". this would indeed be the case if the ionizing spectrum were also independent of the mass of the accreting object .",
    "however , _ the similarity of wind ionization is finally broken by the dependence of the ionizing ( x - ray ) flux on the mass of the accreting object and leads to the different wind ionization properties not only between xrb and agn , but also amongst agn : _ both in agn and xrb a major fraction of their bolometric luminosity is emitted in quasithermal features referred to as the big blue bump ( bbb ) in agn and the multi color disk ( mcd ) in xrb . both are thought to represent emission of the accretion luminosity in black body form by a geometrically thin optically thick disk of size a few radii .",

    "the ionizing flux is in fact not a constant fraction of the bolometric luminosity but it depends on the absolute source luminosity .",

    "using the derived opacities and emissivity we compute the spectrum exiting this zone , which is used as the input for computing the ionization opacity and emissivity of the next zone .",
    "the procedure is repeated to compute the ionization of the wind along a given line of sight and then for different values of the polar angle @xmath1 , to produce the ionization structure of the wind over the entire poloidal plane .",
    "3 of @xcite depicts the density and ionization structure of such winds out to @xmath165 in linear coordinates .",
    "one can see that the wind ionization depends both on the distance from the source @xmath40 and on the angle @xmath1 , being highly ionized at small values ( @xmath166 near @xmath167 ) even at these large distances , while it decreases to @xmath168 at @xmath169 .",
    "it is also clear that for a given @xmath1 , a harder x - ray spectrum will ionize the wind out to larger distances .",
    "since the wind velocity along a given los depends mainly on the radius of launching the specific parcel of gas ( but also the inclination angle @xmath1 ) , absorption features associated with a given ion should appear at smaller velocities the harder the ionizing spectra .",
    "this issue is in fact a little more complicated because we only observe the wind velocity along our line of sight which depends also on the local shape of the poloidal magnetic field lines .",

    "gro 1655 - 40 presents a multitude of absorption features similar to those of agn , however , because of the higher s / n ratio their velocities and ew are better determined and thus more contraining to the outflow models . following detailed modeling",
    "it was concluded @xcite that the wind of gro 1655 - 40 is not consistent with being driven by either line radiation pressure or thermally by the x - ray heating of the outer regions of the disk .",
    "the authors then concluded that the only reasonable means of driving the outflow in this object is magnetic , via an mhd wind similar to those outlined in this work .",

    ", one is led to a similar conclusion concerning the mass flux in the wind of cir x-1 by using the parameters provided in @xcite , indicating that a wind mass flux increasing with @xmath40 may not be an uncommon feature in accretion powered sources .    finally , it is worth noting that the disks of all three of the above sources are apparently at high inclinations , i.e. directions that favor observations of such features ( less ionization , higher column densities ) . for lower inclination systems ,",
    "the winds are likely far more highly ionized , yielding no apparent absorption features .",
    "the procedure outlined in  4 describing the detailed calculation of the ionization of mhd winds was applied to winds associated with seyfert galaxies @xcite . as noted above , given the scale invariance of the wind column and ionization parameter , the main difference between the ionization winds off the disks of different classes of accretion powered sources ( e.g. xrb , seyferts , bal qsos ) is the spectrum of the ionizing radiation . since for seyfert galaxies the x - ray and uv - optical luminosities",

    "there is no mystery here : dust distribution with the specific density profile reprocesses the same amount of continuum flux per decade of radius and re - emits it in ( roughly ) black body form ; since the dust temperature in regions of increasing radius @xmath40 falls - off like @xmath216 the peak emission will also shift to lower frequencies while emitting the same luminosity ; the resulting spectrum would then be `` flat '' in @xmath215 units , consistent with the _ spitzer _ observations of a survey of qso spectra @xcite .",
    "the precise spectrum determination depends , of course , on the details of dust formation and properties and also on the details of the reprocessed spectrum and radiative transfer , as the emission is not necessarily black body and as the outer layers of the mhd wind reprocess not only the continuum luminosity but also the ir emission of the inner `` torus '' regions .",
    "one of the more important aspects of the ir and far - ir emission is the frequency at which the spectrum turns over from `` flat '' to the rayleigh - jeans form ( @xmath217 ) , as this would provide an estimate of the outer torus radius .",
    "combined space ( _ herschel _ ) and ground ( _ alma _ ) observations will be instrumental in this respect .",
    "one should simply note here that the radial dust temperature dependence , @xmath218 , implies that the number of decades in radius over which dust reprocessing takes place is twice the number of decades over which the agn @xmath215 spectrum is `` flat '' . in this respect",

    "so we do make a brief foray into this subject to touch upon two issues on which our model seems to provide a novel insight .",
    "one of the fundamental characteristics of the winds outlined in section 3 are that their velocity fields are mainly keplerian at low latitudes ( @xmath226 ) while becoming ( almost ) radial at larger ones @xcite .",
    "this particular property allows for the possibility of exhibiting emission line features associated both with disks and winds . in fact , there are observations of a `` double horn '' h@xmath28 line profile in certain agn @xcite , the tell - tale sign of disk emission .",
    "these have been modeled as emission excited by the reprocessing of the agn x - ray continuum on a ring - like structure , whose radii and illumination were adjusted to provide agreement with observations .",
    "the mhd wind models in their most simplistic incarnation , namely that described  3 , allow for such profiles for the h@xmath28 transition , precisely because of the disk - like geometry of the flow at low latitudes .",
    "furthermore , the extent of the wind in the @xmath73direction allows also the _ calculation _ of the ew of this transition , which is found to be consistent with observations ( fukumura & kazanas in preparation ) .",
    "the calculations outlined in  4 provide the photonionization of the entire wind , from its smallest ( @xmath227 ) to its largest ( @xmath228 ) scales , set by the size of the accretion disk that powers the source . with the wind ionization given ,",
    "one can also produce scalings and correlations involving properties of the corresponding emission of lines of the photoionized plasma .",
    "while such an in - depth study is beyond the scope of the present paper , some straightforward scalings can be produced even at this early stage . with this in mind , we compute below the scaling of one of the prominent transitions agn , namely h@xmath28 with the source luminosity , given that such a relation has already been well documented @xcite ( we refrain focusing on the ly@xmath28 and  transitions since , being resonant ones , demand a more careful treatment within the specific model ) .    quite generally , the luminosity of the h@xmath28 transition produced in the mhd winds discussed in the previous sections can be written as @xmath229 where @xmath230 is the recombination coefficient , @xmath231 the wind emission measure and @xmath232 ev , is the h@xmath28 energy . as noted in eq .",

    "the obvious point to note between eqs ( [ eq : linel ] ) and ( [ eq : diskl ] ) is that they both are proportional to the object s mass @xmath108 ; also for @xmath164 ( @xmath28 is the accretion disk viscosity parameter ) implying that the accretion flow is in the adaf regime , the ratio @xmath248 of the line to the bolometric accretion luminosity is independent of both @xmath86 and the mass @xmath108 .",

    "in the previous sections we presented a broad strokes picture of the 2d agn structure , one that encompasses many decades in radius and frequency and supplements the well known schematic of @xcite with an outflow launched across the entire disk area and velocity roughly equal to the local keplerian velocity at each launch radius .",

    "this dependence complicates the situation because it breaks the overall wind flow scale invariance on the mass @xmath108 . as noted earlier",

    "finally , the high ionization of the inner regions of these flows in xrb , naturally accounts for the low velocities of the fe - k features observed in galactic sources .",
    "the crucial and fundamental aspect of the underlying mhd wind model that allows the broad consolidation of the very diverse observational phenomenology of the previous sections `` under the same roof '' is their ability to produce density profiles that decreases like @xmath261 with the radius .",
    "it is this property that allows the ionization parameter to decrease with distance while still providing sufficient column to allow the detection of both high and low ionization ions in the agn x - ray spectra .",
    "it is also this property that controls the velocities @xmath61 of the fe - k transitions in galactic sources , seyferts and bal qso , due to the relation between @xmath61 and @xmath41 ( @xmath262 for the scaling proposed herein ; the bp82 scaling leads to @xmath263 and therefore to much smaller velocity for a given ion , i.e. a given value of @xmath41  and also to a much smaller column ) .",
    "furthermore , it is this specific density profile of the wind that allows us to incorporate the physics of the agn torii within the context of the broader physics of accretion onto the compact object , while at the same time producing ir spectra in broad agreement with observation .",
    "this confluence of the agn spectral properties with the wind spacial structure indicates that agn and xrb are objects that span many decades in radius and frequency , despite the fact that most of their luminosity is released within a few radii .",
    "the price to pay for a density distribution such as that proposed above is the need to invoke winds whose mass flux increases with distance from the source ( and more specifically like @xmath264 ) .",

    "however , the importance of the specific mass flux dependence on @xmath40 in the interpretation of the agn x - ray and uv absorber properties will likely attract the attention of future studies on this issue .",
    "clearly a presentation as broad as that above by necessity ignores a large number of issues , both observational and theoretical each of which is in fact a separate branch in the study of agn physics . as such",
    ", we have ignored the effects of radiation pressure , considered in much detail numerically by proga and collaborators @xcite and semi - analytically by @xcite .",
    "the effects of radiation pressure in combination with those of the mhd winds discussed here have been considered by @xcite and also by @xcite in discussing the agn ir spectra .",
    "these works have shown the effects of radiation pressure to be local , as they depend on the local flow opacity , thus breaking the similarity of the angular dependence of the solutions .",
    "it was shown in these works that radiation pressure  pushes \" to open up the field lines to produce a density dependence on @xmath1 different from that given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]a and hence would influence the population ratios of objects observed at a given column density .",
    "however , the effects of radiation pressure do not affect the dependence of wind mass flux on the distance ( @xmath266 ) , which is set by conditions on the disk ; it is this property that determines the radial dependence of the wind density , the property necessary to account for their observed phenomenology .    as noted above , a radiation driven wind , while 2d in the region of launch",
    ", it will appear radial at sufficiently large distance producing density profiles @xmath267 there . as appealing and compelling as the notion of radiation driven winds is , there is little evidence for them , at least in the agn and xrb x - ray absorber spectra .",
    "advocating radiation driven 2d winds across the entire accretion disk , in a fashion similar to those of  3 , appears difficult because the photon field does not have enough momentum at these large distances to drive a wind with the required mass flux .",
    "interestingly the @xmath268component of the magnetic field , decreasing like @xmath269 has precisely the momentum needed to drive a wind with @xmath270 . in this respect",
    "one should bear in mind that these winds produce most of the kinetic energy at small radii , most of the mass flux at large radii and equal momentum per decade of radius .",
    "another issue that was only briefly touched upon in section 5 , is that of line emission .",
    "it is generally thought that the line emission in agn comes from clouds in pressure equilibrium with a hot intercloud medium , the result of the x - ray heating thermal instability @xcite .",
    "our simple estimates , even though they have ignored this possibility , they nonetheless provide an account for the observed correlation of the h@xmath28 ( a transition with minimal radiative transfer nuances ) with the agn bolometric luminosity . however , one should bear in mind that our model winds do allow for the formation of such clouds at sufficiently small latitudes ( below the alfvn surface ) where the flow is close to hydrostatic equilibrium , i.e. under conditions of a given pressure .",
    "we expect that past the alfvn point , where the flows are under conditions of given density , the formation of these clouds will be less forthcoming .",
    "the issue of cloud or wind agn line emission is an issue that deserves more attention and study , given the smoothness of the agn lines profiles that implies a very large number clouds involved in this process @xcite , but certainly beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "our treatment of the agn ir emission has also glossed over much of what it constitutes an altogether distinct subfield of agn study .",
    "it has been suggested that clouds are also involved in this component of the agn spectra , however with different properties and at radii larger than those of the uv and optical line emitting clouds @xcite .",
    "this is clearly a point that will have to be looked upon with greater care .",
    "a complicating factor in this direction is that of star formation in the agn environment , whose ir contribution introduces additional parameters in such a study . finally , with respect to the ir and far - ir agn spectra , we would like to point to the synergy between x - ray spectroscopy and far - ir observations discussed in  5.1 that would help establish the consistency of this scheme across two very different frequency bands .    finally , we close with a few words on the  feedback \" of our winds on the surrounding medium , which likely provides the mass that eventually  feeds \" the agn .",
    "first , the angular distribution of the flow , as determined by the poloidal field structure , due to its collimation , interacts with only part of the surrounding stellar cluster .",
    "second , the energy flux of the winds considered here , despite their increasing mass flux with radius , is still dominated by the flux at small radii ( @xmath271 ) ; however , they do carry equal momentum per decade of radius ( @xmath272 ) , a fact with potential feedback effects , perhaps the subject of a future publication . finally , the radiation effects of the agn are also limited in @xmath1 due precisely to the winds column increase with this parameter . however , as shown in @xcite , the fraction of _ swift - bat _ selected agn at galactic latitude @xmath273 with x - ray column @xmath274 decreases from @xmath275 to close to zero above luminosity @xmath276 . therefore ,",
    "considering that the observed column pertains not only to the agn wind but also to the entire matter distribution along the los , the radiative effects of high luminosity agn may affect significantly the evolution of their environment .",
    "such constraints will have to be taken into account producing a global evolutionary sequence for our models , which are beyond the scope of the present paper .",

    "<S> we present a unified model for the structure and appearance of accretion powered sources across their entire luminosity range from galactic x - ray binaries to luminous quasars , with emphasis on agn and their phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> central to this model is the notion of mhd winds launched from the accretion disks that power these objects . </S>",
    "<S> these winds provide the matter that manifests as blueshifted absorption features in the uv and x - ray spectra of a large fraction of these sources ; furthermore , their density distribution in the poloidal plane determines the  appearance \" ( i.e. the column and velocity structure of these absorption features ) as a function of the observer inclination angle . </S>",
    "<S> this work focuses on just the broadest characteristics of these objects ; nonetheless , it provides scaling laws that allow one to reproduce within this model the properties of objects spanning a very wide luminosity range and viewed at different inclination angles , and trace them to a common underlying dynamical structure . </S>",
    "<S> its general conclusion is that the agn phenomenology can be accounted for in terms of three parameters : the wind mass flux in units of the eddington value , @xmath0 , the observer s inclination angle @xmath1 and the logarithmic slope between the o / uv and x - ray fluxes @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> however , because of a significant correlation between and uv luminosity , we conclude that the agn structure depends on only two parameters . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the correlations implied by this model appear to extend to and consistent with the characteristics of galactic x - ray sources , suggesting the presence of a truly unified underlying structure for accretion powered sources . </S>"
