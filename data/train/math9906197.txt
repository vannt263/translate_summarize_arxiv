    "there are many isotopy classes of arcs connecting two of the punctures , but as we pass a saddle critical point of type ( 1 ) or type ( 2 ) , the curve @xmath214 remains in the complement of the second arc of intersection .",

    "so the isotopy class of @xmath214 in @xmath125 remains unchanged by a saddle move in these cases .",
    "the third type of critical point does change the isotopy class of the arc , since it changes the boundary points connected by the arc .",
    "the following lemma asserts that this can occur at most once .",
    "[ 2crit ] suppose that @xmath230 is a morse function on a topological disk @xmath231 that restricts to a morse function on @xmath232 .",
    "suppose also that @xmath233 , the restriction of @xmath120 to @xmath232 , has at most four critical points on @xmath232 .",
    "then @xmath120 can have at most one interior critical point of type ( 3 ) that is a saddle connecting distinct arcs in the level set of @xmath120 .",

    "since critical points of morse functions have distinct values , we have that @xmath237 .",
    "the four arcs emerging from the second saddle are therefore disjoint from the first critical level set , and contained in one of the previously defined quadrants .",
    "see figure  [ 2type3 ] .     and",
    "@xmath238 , imply that the boundary of the disk has at least six critical points . ]",
    "the intersection of this quadrant with @xmath232 has four points on which @xmath120 takes the value @xmath239 , and therefore @xmath233 has at least three critical points in this quadrant .",
    "it follows that @xmath233 has at least six critical points , contradicting the hypothesis .",
    "so only one saddle of type ( 3 ) can occur .",
    "since @xmath183 is a topological disk whose boundary has four critical points for the height function , at most one type ( 3 ) critical point can occur .",
    "assume first that a type ( 3 ) critical point does not occur for @xmath240 , on the standard disk , @xmath202 is obtained from @xmath241 by a continuous deformation involving no critical points , while @xmath242 is obtained from @xmath45 by a process that may include passing through critical points of types ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , but none of type ( 3 ) . therefore the isotopy class of @xmath242 in the 4-punctured sphere is the same as that of @xmath243 . since @xmath214 is isotopic to @xmath193 for @xmath123 close to @xmath244",

    "by lemma  [ 2crit ] , there are no type ( 3 ) critical points for @xmath245 .",
    "in this case we repeat the previous argument , but using the function @xmath246 rather than @xmath120 . note that as @xmath24 increases from @xmath247 to @xmath248 for @xmath196 an integer with @xmath44 , the level sets of @xmath63 are again transformed by an application of @xmath31 .",
    "we replace @xmath158 with the arc @xmath249 in @xmath250 which joins @xmath34 to @xmath49 , and @xmath161 with @xmath251 , the boundary of a regular neighborhood of @xmath252 .     and @xmath253 .",

    "@xmath257 is carried by @xmath116 with weights @xmath258 and @xmath259 . by lemma  [ minimal.int ] a curve isotopic to @xmath257",
    "intersects @xmath182 in at least @xmath260 points .",
    "then @xmath261 intersects @xmath182 in at least half as many , or @xmath174 points .",
    "as @xmath123 increases from @xmath262 to 0 , the arc @xmath263 in the component of @xmath264 containing @xmath249 , is carried to an arc in @xmath180 isotopic to @xmath265 .",
    "so @xmath183 again must intersect @xmath182 in at least @xmath4 points . in every case",
    "the curve @xmath182 intersects @xmath183 in at least @xmath4 points .",
    "now consider an arbitrary pl disk @xmath62 with boundary @xmath1 .",
    "after an arbitrarily small isometry of @xmath2 , we can arrange that @xmath62 intersects the @xmath59-axis transversely in a finite number of points , the disk @xmath62 can be approximated by a disk @xmath183 , with smoothly embedded interior , that coincides with @xmath62 in a neighborhood of each intersection point with the @xmath59-axis , and that remains disjoint from other points of the @xmath59-axis .",
    "we choose @xmath122 larger , if necessary , so that in the passage from the morse function @xmath24 to the morse function @xmath120 , the three surfaces @xmath266 and @xmath63 that we consider only intersect the flat parts of the spheres @xmath267 which form the level sets of @xmath120 .",
    "so the intersection of @xmath182 with @xmath266 and @xmath63 is the same as that of the @xmath59-axis with these surfaces , each intersection being in the interior of a triangular face of @xmath62 .",
    "but we have shown that @xmath183 intersects @xmath182 in at least @xmath4 points , and it therefore follows that the pl disk @xmath62 also intersects @xmath182 in at least @xmath4 points .",
    "since a triangle transversely intersects a line in at most one point , and @xmath182 agrees with the @xmath59-axis in a ball containing @xmath62 , @xmath183 and @xmath63 , this implies that @xmath62 contains at least @xmath4 triangles , and theorem  [ exp.disks ] is proved .",
    "* remarks : *    1 .   if we allow spanning disks that self - intersect , then the number of triangles required to span @xmath1 grows only linearly with @xmath6 .",
    "if a spanning surface of arbitrary genus is allowed , it can be shown that the number of triangles required to span @xmath1 grows at most quadratically in @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the number of reidemeister moves required to transform any unknotted curve constructed with @xmath6 polygonal edges into a single triangle has an exponential upper bound derived in @xcite . for the particular @xmath1 constructed here , the number of reidemeister moves required to transform the projection of @xmath1 to a projection with no crossings grows only linearly with @xmath6 .",
    "3 .   the argument establishes somewhat better estimates then claimed above .",
    "if we embed @xmath1 into @xmath2 in a more efficient way , then for large @xmath6 , @xmath1 has at most @xmath269 segments and the number of triangles contained in any disk spanning @xmath1 grows faster than a constant times @xmath270 , where @xmath271 is the golden ratio .",
