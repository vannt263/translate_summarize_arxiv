    "since artin s work @xcite , the relation between the continued fraction expansion and the geodesic flow on the modular surface @xmath0 has been studied extensively ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the map that gives the continued fraction expansion of a given real number in @xmath1 , which is defined on @xmath2 to itself by @xmath3 , the fractional part of @xmath4 , is called the continued fraction map or the gauss map .",
    "it is precisely the first return map of the geodesic flow on the surface @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a subgroup of @xmath7 of index 2 , corresponding to the dual of farey tessellation @xcite .",
    "more recently , a. broise - alamichel and f. paulin studied the relation between continued fraction expansion for functions and geodesic flow in trees , extending artin s work to function fields @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the farey map for the real case was introduced to find intermediate convergents by s. ito @xcite and also as an intermittent model by m. feigenbaum , i. procaccia , and t. tel @xcite , independently .",
    "it is defined by @xmath8 the gauss map is an acceleration of the farey map : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the first partial quotient in the continued fraction expansion of @xmath11 ( see @xcite for the geometric meaning of the farey map ) .    in this article , we define two kinds of new maps , one which we call geometric farey map , and the others which we call algebraic farey maps for function fields .",
    "we investigate arithmetic properties of the intermediate convergents arising from these maps , and study ergodic properties of these maps .",
    "although a farey map for function fields was constructed already in @xcite based on the euclidean algorithm for polynomials , we propose alternative definitions .",
    "we first construct the geometric farey map , which is a geometric analogue of the farey map for the real case .",
    "namely , it is the time - one map of the geodesic flow on the modular ray ( see section  [ gfarey ] for the detail ) .",
    "unfortunately , the analogy is not so clear , since there are many ford spheres ( see section  [ sec:2.3 ] for definition ) tangent to each other in a tree , unlike the real case .",
    "this leads us to define algebraic farey maps .",
    "the algebraic farey maps has many advantages .",
    "first of all , the farey map in @xcite is either a special case or some acceleration of an algebraic farey map ( see section  [ sec:3.2 ] ) .",
    "it is roughly a composition of two time - one maps of the geodesic flow .",
    "the map is given by the multiplication action of an element of @xmath12)$ ] which preserves ford spheres .",
    "as in the real case , the artin map is an acceleration of an algebraic farey map by the time depending only on the degree of the first partial quotient .",
    "moreover , we obtain all the intermediate convergents ( see section  [ sec:3.2 ] ) .    note that the first return map of the geodesic flow was used in @xcite in relation with the gauss map , but that no farey map has been investigated geometrically yet .",
    "let @xmath13 be the quotient field of polynomials over the finite field @xmath14 of @xmath15 elements , where @xmath15 is a power of a prime .",
    "denote by @xmath16 the completion of @xmath17 with respect to the valuation @xmath18 and @xmath19 be the corresponding discrete valuation ring .",
