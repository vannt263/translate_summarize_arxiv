    "the most common joint disease is osteoarthritis ( oa ) , which causes joint pain and disability in those affected .",
    "it represents a growing cost to the healthcare system as the incidence is expected to increase from roughly 48 million people in 2005 to 65 million by 2030 @xcite .",
    "a subset of these cases develop after a known trauma and are then labeled post - traumatic oa ( ptoa ) , and despite being heavily researched , the treatment options to prevent the occurrence of oa after an injury remain limited @xcite .",
    "this is partly because the response of articular cartilage to compressive stress is complex .",
    "moderate physiological stresses are known to be beneficial , causing the cells in cartilage , chondrocytes , to increase production of cartilage matrix molecules @xcite .",
    "severe applications of stress , such as a blunt impact injury or intra - articular fracture , cause chondrocyte death and eventual cartilage deterioration leading to ptoa development @xcite .",
    "however , the direct cell death from these impact injuries seems to be minor , as the majority of the cell death happens hours to days after the injury @xcite . a complex interplay between reactive oxygen species ( ros ) ,",
    "pro - inflammatory cytokines ( pic ) , and erythropoietin ( epo ) seems to dominate if / how this cell death occurs and spreads @xcite .",
    "creating a model that describes this pathway and determines thresholds that can cause the cell death to spread would provide an invaluable tool for identifying injuries that are at risk for ptoa lesion development or extrapolate treatment effects at varying doses or time scales that might not be feasible experimentally . to that end , in the current article we present a multiscale mathematical model of the mechanotransductive processes that result from applying pressure with a metal indenter onto a cylindrical cartilage explant .",
    "the model consists of three scales : mechanical ( tissue - level ) , cellular , and chemical .",
    "the mechanical component , external to the core biomathematical model and simulated with the finite element solver abaqus , estimates the strains resulting from the pressure on the cartilage explant .",
    "the cellular component categorizes the behavior and states of chondrocytes under different chemical signals .",
    "the chemical component describes these chemical signals , as well as the cytokines the chondrocytes release .",
    "previous attempts to model the properties of cartilage only considered its mechanical behavior , for example @xcite .",
    "we aim to build on the biomechanical approach by adding the interplay between the chondrocytes and cytokines , resulting in articular cartilage lesions . in previous work on this topic ,",
    "the model in @xcite considered constant cyclic loading on the cartilage , which has a different effect than the singular pressure that we are concerned with in the current study . in @xcite and @xcite , the authors used delay differential equations to describe the time delay in the switch of chondrocytes from one state to another . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors present an age - structured model that allows that switch to happen after a chondrocyte has been in a certain state for a certain amount of time .",
    "age in this context is not actual cell age but how long a cell has been in its current state .",
    "this approach has led to faster computation times and greater model flexibility , and as such is used in the model in this paper .",
    "what is fundamentally different in the current model is that , unlike @xcite , we integrate explicit mechanics into a biomathematical model in order to simulate the strain response of the tissue under pressure loading .",
    "this mechanical component uses explicit finite element analysis by computing the propagation of strain through the tissue from the applied pressure and calculates the starting density distribution of necrotic cells , which initiate the cellular and chemical components of the model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ mm_section ] introduces the model s equations and the numerical methods used for their solution .",
    "section [ results_section ] describes the numerical results , and section [ discussion_section ] is discussion .",
    "this section describes the mathematical model and the implemented numerical methods .",
    "the cartilage explant is modeled as a cylinder , with the assumption of circular symmetry .",
    "this assumption reduces the model to two dimensions in space : radial ( @xmath0 ) and axial ( @xmath1 , representing the depth of the cylinder ) .",
    "the independent variables of the system are radius ( @xmath0 ) , depth ( @xmath1 ) , time ( @xmath2 ) , and cell - state age ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "a schematic of the system is presented in figure [ flowchart ] .",
    "the pressure load causes necrosis of the chondrocytes .",
    "necrotic chondrocytes release damage - associated molecular patterns ( damps ) , which cause the chondrocytes to release pro - inflammatory cytokines ( pic ) , such as tumor necrosis factor @xmath4 ( tnf-@xmath4 ) and interleukin 6 ( il-6 ) .",
    "inflammation leads to cell apoptosis and the degradation of the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) .",
    "however , it also signals the release of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) .",
    "ros are precursors for the release of erythropoietin ( epo ) , which is an anti - inflammatory cytokine that counteracts the effects of inflammation .",
    "this complex feedback cycle requires two main components in our system of equations , cellular and chemical .",
    "the elements of the cellular component are :    * @xmath5 : population density ( cells per unit area ) of unsignaled healthy cells at a given time and location . * @xmath6 : population density of healthy cells signaled by damps and in the process of becoming catabolic cells . in the presence of ros",
    "they may be signaled to release epo ( by moving to the @xmath7 class ) in 20 - 24 hours .",
    "* @xmath8 : population density of healthy cells signaled by ros and starting to produce epo . *",
    "@xmath9 : population density of cells in the catabolic state .",

    "catabolic cells signaled by pic enter the epor - active state and may switch back to healthy state @xmath13 when signaled by epo . *",
    "@xmath14 : population density of apoptotic cells .",

    "necrotic cells emerge only due to the initial load .",
    "they release alarmins ( damps ) into the system .",
    "chondrocytes exhibit minimal motility inside the ecm , so the cellular equations do not feature diffusion terms or other motility .",

    "* @xmath19 : concentration of general pro - inflammatory cytokines ( pic ) , e.g. tnf-@xmath4 and il-6 , produced by catabolic cells ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "they have the following effects on the system : 1 .",
    "signal healthy cells ( @xmath17 ) to enter the catabolic state ( @xmath10 ) , 2 .   signal catabolic cells ( @xmath10 ) to enter the epor - active state , 3 .",
    "cause both catabolic and epor - active cells to become apoptotic , 4 .   degrade the ecm , which in turn increases the level of damps , resulting in further damage to the cartilage , 5 .",

    "inflammation can suppresses this process .",
    "epo helps epor - active cells ( @xmath11 ) to switch back to the healthy state @xmath13 .",
    "the effects of epo depend on its concentration .",
    "when the concentration of epo passes the threshold @xmath21 @xcite , the spread of inflammation can be slowed by terminating the effect of the pro - inflammatory cytokines and damps on the system .",
    "we also assume that @xmath7 cells revert to the @xmath13 state when the epo level exceeds the @xmath21 threshold .",
    "we assume that the chemicals diffuse through the entire region .",
    "the pro - inflammatory cytokines ( pic ) , such as tnf-@xmath4 and il-6 , are the main promoter of cartilage lesion formation in this model , while epo promotes cell recovery and limits the inflammation @xcite .",
    "the balance between these pro - inflammatory and anti - inflammatory cytokines is essential for understanding the underlying causes of oa and is an important feature of the model .",
    "* @xmath22 : density of the extracellular matrix ( ecm ) .",
    "ecm is degraded by pro - inflammatory cytokines and releases damps .",
    "the degradation of ecm is measured by the decrease in the concentration of so@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "+    ecm degradation by proteases is simplified here to be related solely to pro - inflammatory cytokines , and expressed in terms of decreased suflate ( so@xmath23 ) concentration . in cartilage , the proteoglycan groups , which comprise the majority of the ecm , contain sulfate groups and the measurement of sulfate concentration is related to ecm integrity or loss thereof .",
    "the average concentration of so@xmath23 in normal undamaged cartilage is @xmath24 g / l @xcite , which is the initial weight of ecm in this model .",
    "sufficiently high epo concentration can also block ecm degradation .",

    "the vast majority of parameter perturbations did not lead to significant qualitative changes in the behavior of the system ; the changes did not generally alter the shape of the graphs or the relationship between the values .",
    "there were some quantitative differences between runs .",
    "given that many of our parameters are estimated , better approximations can be a topic for future work .",
    "however , the model captures , at least qualitatively , expected chemical and cellular behaviors that can result after an injurious pressure load .",
    "notable mentions among the parameters that produced large changes are @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "low @xmath57 allows higher saturation of pic , which leads to more transition of healthy cells into sick cells , as well as higher degradation of the ecm .",

    "low @xmath58 allows for higher saturation of damps . considering that damps released by the necrotic cells after the loading triggers the whole system , the significant effect of @xmath58 perturbations on the system",
    "is expected .",
    "some differences that resulted from low @xmath58 are the near eradication of @xmath13 cells and a more pronounced diffusion of the chemicals by day 14 . to see the significant changes in behavior in the system when @xmath58 is 0.1 , refer to figures [ lambda_m_healthy ] - [ lambda_m_ecm ] .",
    "we presented a multiscale mathematical model of the balancing act between the pro- and anti- inflammatory cytokines released by the chondrocytes in articular cartilage under the application of pressure from an indenter onto a cylindrical cartilage explant .",
    "our current model differs from previous work by incorporating a mechanical finite element simulation and analysis to estimate the role of the initial loading on the biochemical components of the model .",
    "this addition also requires an extra spatial dimension for the cartilage ( depth ) .",
    "the model includes three components , chemical , cellular , and mechanical ( tissue - scale ) , instead of the two components of the previous work .",
    "the mechanical component describes the strain and cell death resulting from the initial pressure application .",
    "the cellular component describes the different states of the chondrocytes ( healthy , sick , dead ) , and the different chemicals being in these states makes them release .",
    "the chemical component represents the interplay between chemicals , their signaling to cells to switch states , and their release by the chondrocytes in a particular state .",
    "the mechanical component was modeled using linear elasticity , solved with the finite element solver abaqus .",
    "the chemical component was modeled by reaction - diffusion equations , and the cellular component was modeled by age - structure , to capture the cellular age of state - switching .",
    "the numerical results of the model simulated the anticipated chemical and cellular behaviors well .",
    "concentrations of chemicals and different cellular states are highest around the center of the cylinder , which was expected , given that this is the position of the pressure application .",
    "therefore , the model is successful in qualitatively estimating the effect of injurious pressure application on the cartilage explant for 14 days . for a better quantitative estimates",
    "we would need a better parametrization , a better understanding of the sensitivity of the system to perturbations of the unknown parameters and the initial strains , and experimental validation .",
    "longitudinal data over a longer time frame would further allow us to validate and calibrate our model to capture the development of oa in the long run . the sensitivity analysis provided no surprises ; the model s responses to perturbations were all biologically reasonable and expected given the equations and their dependence on the perturbed parameters .",
    "the only parameter change that produced a vastly different system behavior was setting @xmath58 to 0.1 ( see figures [ lambda_m_healthy ] - [ lambda_m_ecm ] ) .",
    "one limitation of the model is that it does not include cartilage heterogeneity . making the model seem more mechanistic by using biphasic elasticity would introduce additional modeling and computational complexity . in the end",
    ", we may not have a significantly more accurate model .",
    "furthermore , linear elasticity seems to be a sufficient approximation for the behavior of cartilage under many physiological loading conditions @xcite .",
