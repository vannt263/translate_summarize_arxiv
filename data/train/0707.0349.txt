    "this is because the coulomb exchange interaction or the hund s rule coupling drives all spins to polarize into a single direction .",

    "( strictly speaking , ferromagnetism can occur only in an infinitely large system , but we may use the terminology for a finite system if the relaxation time is large enough . )    the effective hamiltonian for the coulomb exchange interaction is given by the heisenberg model . here , for the sake of simplicity",

    "this is in a sharp contrast to the hamiltonian for a nanomagnet , where @xmath77 can be regarded nonvanishing only for neighboring electron pairs since the index @xmath5 represents the site in the real space .",

    "the spin dynamics is well described by the master equation , @xmath78 , where the symbol @xmath79  denotes the probability distribution function specifying the spin configuration , and @xmath80 is the liouville operator associated with the hamiltonian .",

    "the relaxation rate of the system is equal to the minimum eigenvalue @xmath86 of the liouville operator .",
    "thus the relaxation time is given by @xmath87 .    to get a concrete idea ,",

    "it is observed in fig.[figreltime ] that the relaxation time is given by the asymptotic formula ( [ relaxtime ] ) already for @xmath101 .",
    "the relaxation rate is given by the arrhenius - type formula also in the generic model ( [ ising ] ) with @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the energy difference between the highest energy state and the ground state .",

    "note that in an ordinary nanomagnet composed of @xmath31 spins , the relaxation time is given by ( [ relaxtime ] ) with@xmath106where @xmath107 is the number of the nearest neighboring spins .",
    "it is remarkable that the size dependence of the relaxation time is @xmath108 for trigonal zigzag nanodisks , though it is @xmath109 for normal nanomagnets . this is because any one spin couples with all other spins in the zero - energy state",
