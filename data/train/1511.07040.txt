    "the hawking radiation @xcite is one of the most robust and important predictions of quantum field theory in curved space - time .",
    "here we would like to study some ( local ) properties of a generic friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) space - time with non - flat topology .",
    "let us remind some basic facts about the formalism .",
    "any spherically symmetric four dimensional metric can be expressed in the form : @xmath0 with @xmath1 a tensor describing a two - dimensional space - time with coordinates @xmath2 , @xmath3 being the `` areal radius '' and @xmath4 encoding the metric of a two - dimensional sphere orthogonal respect to the first one .    the dynamical trapping horizon -if exists- is located in the correspondence of @xmath5 thus , one may define the quasi - local misner - sharp gravitational energy as @xmath6\\,.\\ ] ] for example , the mass of a black hole described by this formalism results to be @xmath7 .",
    "the killing vector fields @xmath8 are the generators of the isometries with @xmath9 : in the static case , with the time - like killing vector field @xmath10 , the killing surface gravity @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 in the dynamical case , the real geometric object which generalizes the killing vector field is the kodama vector field @xcite , @xmath13 thus , the hayward surface gravity associated with dynamical horizon is @xcite @xmath14 the hawking radiation is a thermal radiation of the black holes due to quantum effects . in the static case , all derivations of hawking radiation lead to a semi - classical expression for the radiation rate @xmath15 in terms of the exchange @xmath16 of the killing energy @xmath17 and the killing / hawking temperature @xmath18 , @xmath19 in the dynamical case",
    "one may suggest the kodama / hayward temperature : @xmath20 an important example that demonstrates the covariance of the formalism is given by the de sitter space - time .",
    "the static patch reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 and the horizon is located at @xmath23 with surface gravity @xmath24 .",
    "the second patch is given by the expanding coordinates of the flat flrw metric , @xmath25 where @xmath26 and the dynamical ( cosmological ) horizon is @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "finally , the global patch in non - flat flrw metric is given by @xmath27 with @xmath28 , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 again .",
    "now we will see how it is possible to associate a temperature to the dynamical horizon of flat and non - flat de sitter space - time in ( [ flat])([global ] ) .",
    "we recall the quantization of a conformal coupled massless scalar field in the frlw space - time .",
    "the metric reads @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the conformal time , @xmath31 is a mass scale and the topology of the spacial section can be flat , spherically or hyperbolic for @xmath32 , respectively .    given a massless scalar field , @xmath33 such that the modes are conformal invariant , namely @xmath34 , the associated wightman function @xmath35 results to be @xmath36 the wightman function satisfies the following rule for the conformal transformations of the metric : @xmath37 we may also take @xmath38 due to the homogeneity and isotropy of flrw space - times .",
    "let us consider the spherical case ( @xmath39 ) in ( [ metric ] ) , @xmath40 this metric is conformally related to the minkowski space - time , @xmath41 with @xmath42 thus , by starting from the well - known wightman function in minkowski space - time , one can use ( [ conf ] ) and derive for the spherical flrw metric @xmath43 the hyperbolic case @xmath44 is obtained with the substitution @xmath45 , while the flat case @xmath46 corresponds to the limit @xmath47 .",
    "let us consider a free massless quantum scalar field @xmath48 in thermal equilibrium at the temperature @xmath49 in flat space - time . we know",
    "that finite temperature field theory effects of this kind can be investigated by given that the scalar field defined in the euclidean manifold @xmath50 , where the imaginary time is @xmath51 , compactified in the circle @xmath52 with period @xmath53 .",
    "we briefly review the local quantity @xmath54 , which is a divergent quantity due to the product of valued operator distribution in the same point @xmath55 . by making use of the zeta - function regularization procedure ,",
    "the quantum fluctuations read @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the local zeta - function associated with the operator @xmath58 .",
    "it is easy to see that the analytic continuation of the local zeta - function is regular at @xmath59 and finally one gets @xmath60 in this way we obtain the temperature of the quantum field in thermal equilibrium from the zeta - function renormalized vacuum expectation value , namely we have a quantum thermometer .",
    "now we extend the argument to generic flrw metric .",
    "the off - diagonal wightman function ( [ wsph ] ) leads to @xmath61 with @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the conformal factor .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath64 , one has @xmath65 it is possible to show that @xmath66 where @xmath67 the dot being the derivative respect to the proper time , @xmath68 being the usual hubble parameter , and @xmath69 the radial acceleration .",
    "therefore , after the regularization for the divergent part at @xmath70 , @xmath71 this result is quite general and it is valid also for spatial curvature @xmath72 .      in the case of de sitter space - time with @xmath39 , we may put @xmath73 and the expression for quantum fluctuations reads @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the areal radius of the kodama observer and the acceleration has been computed as @xmath76 for a kodama observer with @xmath77 we recover the gibbons - hawking temperature associated with de sitter space - time , @xmath78 this is an important check of our approach , since it shows the coordinate independence of the result for the important case of de sitter space - time .      the minkowski space - time",
    "may be written in a frlw form with hyperbolic section @xmath44 ( milne universe ) , @xmath79 making use of the hayward formalism , it is easy to verify that there is no dynamical horizon and the surface gravity is vanishing . in this case",
    "we obtain @xmath80 namely only the radial acceleration @xmath69 is present and the temperature is defined as @xmath81 recovering the well known unruh effect .",
    "this proceeding is based on the paper @xcite .",
    "i thank sergio zerbini for helpful discussions ."
