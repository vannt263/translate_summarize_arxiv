    "although trapped ions have found many applications in physics @xcite , they caused a turning point in the evolution of quantum computing when the paper entitled _ quantum computation with cold trapped ions _ was published by cirac and zoller in 1995 @xcite .",
    "this proposal launched also an avalanche of other physical realizations of quantum computing using different physical systems , from high finesse cavities to widely manufactured semiconductors @xcite . through the years",
    "we have learnt a lot , but also revealed many peculiarities , about the physical realization of quantum computing which has led to many discussions concerning the conditions under which we could in principle implement quantum computing in certain quantum systems .    before we give the list of requirements for the physical implementation of quantum computing we will introduce the fundamental terminology to appear throughout this paper .",
    "we will follow the definitions in ref .",
    "@xcite .    * a _ qubit _ is a quantum system in which the logical boolean states 0 and 1 are represented by a prescribed pair of normalized and mutually orthogonal quantum states labelled as @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "these two states form a computational basis and any other ( pure ) state of the qubit can be written as a superposition [ q1 ]     the multi - qubit cnot on @xmath2 ions ( [ qg21 ] ) differs from the two - qubit cnot gate only in the number of laser pulses required for its realization .",
    "the multi - qubit cnot gate corresponds to two @xmath3-pulses on the carrier [ @xmath4 , @xmath5 , a single @xmath6-pulse on the first red sideband ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 @xmath9-pulses also on the first red sideband ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) .",
    "thus , it requires all together @xmath14 laser pulses , where @xmath15 refers to the number of the ions involved in the gate ( @xmath16 control ions , one target ion ) .",
    "then , in the spirit of the previous discussion the minimal total time for the realization of the multi - qubit cnot gate on @xmath2 ions reads [ sp2 ] t=2(t_a+qt_b ) , where we assume @xmath17 and @xmath18 is given by eq .",
    "( [ sp1 ] ) for a total number @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) of the ions confined in the trap .",
    "we give some estimations for the realization of multi - qubit cnot gates in table [ tab ] , where the number  @xmath2 of the ions involved in the gate and the total number  @xmath19 of the ions in the trap are equal ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "we stress this point because there is a difference if we realize a two - qubit cnot gate ( @xmath22 ) having just two ions in the trap ( @xmath23 ) , then we get for the total time of the gate [ sp3 ] t_1=2(t_a+2t_b^n=2)0.5 , or having a larger register of ten ions in the trap ( @xmath24 ) , what gives [ sp4 ] t_2=2(t_a+2t_b^n=10)1.1 at the same fidelity @xmath25 .    any multi - qubit gate on a register of size @xmath19",
    "can be decomposed into a network of single - qubit rotations and two - qubit cnot gates @xcite .",
    "however , there might be a possibility to realize this multi - qubit directly , if a given physical system allows it .",
    "for instance , the multi - qubit cnot gate on six qubits can be decomposed into the network of 12 two - qubit cnot gates including three additional auxiliary qubits @xcite . in the case of cold trapped ions",
    "it requires the total time for the realization of the whole network ( @xmath22 , @xmath26 ) [ sp5 ] t_3=122(t_a+2t_b^n=9)12.7 .",
    "however , the direct implementation ( [ qg21 ] ) would take only ( @xmath27 ) [ sp6 ] t_4=2(t_a+6t_b^n=6)2.6 , which is about five - times less than the former case .",
    "we have again assumed almost the perfect fidelity @xmath25 of the operation .",
    "we conclude that there can be quantum systems that may support a direct implementation of multi - qubit gates , rather than their decomposition into fundamental gates , what may bring advantages at experimental realization as well as in quantum state synthesis @xcite .",
    "throughout the paper we have discussed many aspects of cold trapped ions for quantum computing but we have not dealt with the decoherence which appears to be a main obstacle in achievements of experimental quantum computing . the reason was that our main goal has been to give a basic review and the discussion on decoherence sources and effects would refer more to an advanced study @xcite . nevertheless , for the sake of completeness we would like to mention on this place some decoherence aspects met in the lab .",
    "we will follow a detailed study of experimental issues in quantum manipulations with trapped ions given by wineland et al . @xcite .",
    "the decoherence will be met in a more general usage of this term .",
    "thus , by the _ decoherence _ we mean any effect that limits the fidelity ( the match between desired and achieved realization ) .",
    "further , we will distinguish three categories .",
    "* _ motional state decoherence _ is the most troublesome source of the decoherence in ion trap experiments and refers to the relaxation of two vibrational states @xmath28 and @xmath29 of a given motional mode used as the quantum data bus . the ions are cooled to the ground motional state @xmath28 and the excitation to the @xmath29 state is used for the transfer of information on a distinct ion . however , this scenario is not ideal for several reasons : * * instability of trap parameters .",
    "we are simply not able to control all voltages as they undergo fluctuations and dephasing . *",
    "* we also have to count on ( i ) the micromotion , ( ii ) the coulomb repulsion between the ions making the motional modes ( except the com mode ) anharmonic in reality and ( iii ) stray electrode fields causing possible excitations of the ion motion . *",
    "* we have considered just a single motional mode in our approach , but there are also other @xmath30 modes present and the cross - coupling between the modes appears . if spectator @xmath30 modes are not cooled to their ground motional states , the energy can be transferred to the mode of interest .",
    "this happens because the trapping potential is anharmonic in real and these higher anharmonic terms are responsible for the cross - coupling .",
    "* * we should mention also inelastic and elastic collisions with the background gas , even though experiments are carried out in an excellent environment ( @xmath31 ) . * _ internal state decoherence _ corresponds to the evolution when a pure state of the ion @xmath32 transforms into a mixture @xmath33 .",
    "the ions demonstrate internal decoherence times of the order of seconds ( calcium ) up to minutes and hours ( beryllium ) .",
    "the type of the decoherence discussed here can be eliminated by a proper choice of metastable excited states with long lifetimes . *",
    "_ operational decoherence",
    "_ refers to the precision of coherent laser - ion manipulations .",
    "there are several aspects that we have to consider : * * when the ion is illuminated with a laser beam , one has to control the pulse duration and the phase adjustment in order to avoid the preparation of unwanted states . * * due to the laser spatial intensity profile , there is a probability ( if the ions are spaced too closely ) that the state of a neighbouring ion will be affected . * * if we consider the standing - wave configuration we have to take care of the precise position of the ion in the node or the antinode of the standing wave what seems to be very troublesome .",
    "* * finally , off - resonant transitions are always present and we have to control the laser power very carefully to avoid their excitations",
    ".    however , there is a way to eliminate the effect of the decoherence .",
    "we can encode information into a  decoherence - free subspace whose states are invariant under coupling to the environment @xcite .",
    "we have been discussing cold trapped ions so far .",
    "_ cold _ refers to the fact that all motional modes have to be cooled to their ground motional states because the dynamics assumes the precise control over the motional state .",
    "however , there have appeared other proposals referring to _ warm _ or _ hot _ trapped ions which assume an arbitrary motional state .",
    "* poyatos et al.@xcite proposed a scheme for the realization of two - qubit cnot gates between two trapped ions using ideas from the atomic interferometry .",
    "they split the wavepacket of the control ion into two directions depending on its internal state with a laser pulse .",
    "then they address one of the wavepackets of the target ion changing conditionally its internal state and finally they bring together the wavepackets of the ions using another laser pulse .",
    "the ions communicate through the coulomb repulsion and under ideal conditions the scheme is independent on the motional state of the ions . *",
    "milburn et al.@xcite described two schemes for manipulations with warm trapped ions .",
    "firstly , they use the adiabatic passage for the conditional phase shift , i.e. the phase of the ion is flipped if the motional mode is in the superposition of odd number states and the ion is excited . the com mode in an arbitrary vibrational state",
    "is used for quantum logic but all other motional modes are assumed to be cooled to their ground motional states .",
    "secondly , they apply the idea of the collective spin @xcite for faster gates .",
    "this idea has been also used for the introduction of multi - qubit gates for quantum computing @xcite . *",
    "srensen and mlmer @xcite proposed a novel scheme based on the idea of bichromatic light ( @xmath34 ) . realizing the two - qubit cnot gate they illuminate two ions with the bichromatic light coupling the states @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "they choose detunings far enough from the resonance with the first red and blue sidebands such that the intermediate states @xmath37 and @xmath38 are not populated in the process .",
    "the scheme is not sensitive on fluctuations of the number of phonons in the relevant motional mode .",
    "it is also possible to illuminate with the bichromatic light more ions and generate a multiparticle entangled state .",
    "actually , these experiments were already realized in nist @xcite and they generated the ghz state with two ions @xmath39 with a fidelity @xmath40 and also the ghz state with four ions @xmath41 with a fidelity @xmath42 using beryllium ions and the raman scheme .",
    "jonathan and plenio proposed light shift induced quantum gates for trapped ions insensitive on phonon number in motional modes ( thermal motion ) @xcite . *",
    "finally , there has appeared a proposal of a scalable quantum computer with the ions in an array of microtraps by cirac and zoller @xcite detailed in ref .",
    "the ions are placed in a 2d array of independent ion microtraps @xcite and there is another ion ( head ) that moves above this plane .",
    "if we position the head above a particular ion from the array and switch on the laser in the perpendicular direction , we can realize a two - qubit gate .",
    "this operation allows us to swap the state of the ion to the head which can be moved immediately above a distinct ion in the array and transfer the information onto it .",
    "the ions oscillating in the microtraps are not assumed to be cooled to their ground motional states .",
    "however , their motion can couple to the environment .",
    "it becomes relevant during the time when the ion interacts with the head but not in the case when the head moves .",
    "in this paper we have tried to review achievements accomplished in the field of cold trapped ions . in the first part we have discussed in detail the ion loading and trapping process , the collective vibrational motion of the ions .",
    "we have also given a detailed derivation of the hamiltonian governing the dynamics of the system including the discussion of weak coupling and lamb - dicke regime .",
    "further , we have reviewed laser cooling techniques and a detection process with experimental illustrations on calcium ions . in the second part we have discussed the implementation of quantum computing using cold trapped ions .",
    "in particular , we have described how to realize single - qubit , two - qubit and multi - qubit quantum logic gates .",
    "finally , we have estimated the speed of quantum gates with cold trapped ions .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give an introduction to this field with many references on relevant papers and studies .",
    "we would like to thank peter knight , danny segal , martin plenio , andrew steane and miloslav duek for their helpful comments and suggestions .",
    "we are also grateful to rainer blatt , giovanna morigi and david kielpinski for sending us original files of their figures .",
    "this work was supported by the european union projects qubits ( ist-1999 - 13021 ) and quest ( hprn - ct-2000 - 00121 ) .",
    "we acknowledge the special support from the slovak academy of sciences .",
    "one of us ( m. . ) is thankful for the support from the esf via the _ programme on quantum information and quantum computation_.",
    "the expression ( [ int9 ] ) corresponds to the complete hamiltonian in the sense that it includes also off - resonant transitions . for instance , even though a sufficiently intense laser is tuned on the carrier , the off - resonant transitions on the sidebands are also present and they cause imprecisions and perturbations in the dynamics .",
    "this can be avoided by setting the laser intensity @xmath43 , i.e. the laser coupling constant [ eq .",
    "( [ int8 ] ) or ( [ int8.1 ] ) ] , sufficiently small . in",
    "what follows we will determine conditions ( characterizing the _ weak coupling regime _ ) under which we can neglect off - resonant transitions .",
    "the implementation of quantum gates on cold trapped ions requires laser pulses on the carrier [ fig.[3freq](a ) ] and on the first red sideband [ fig.[3freq](b ) ] .",
    "therefore , we will discuss the dynamics on these two spectral lines . at first , let us assume that the laser is tuned on the carrier @xmath44 .",
    "the closest off - resonant transitions ( detuned by the frequency  @xmath45 ) are on the first blue and on the first red sideband [ fig.[off](a ) ] .",
    "we will consider only the respective terms in the hamiltonian ( [ int9 ] ) and drop down the index @xmath46 . in the lamb - dicke limit",
    "we can write [ off1 ] _ 1= _ + + ( i)_+e^it+ ( i)_+e^-it+ .",
    "further , we assume the ion to be initially in the state @xmath47 , we apply the hamiltonian ( [ off1 ] ) and calculate the probability of off - resonant transitions .",
    "the dynamics governed by a time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath48 is described to the first order by the unitary evolution operator [ off3 ] ( t , t_0)- _",
    "t_0^t(t^)dt^. then the probability to find the ion ( initially prepared in the state @xmath47 ) in the state @xmath49 ( i.e. undergoing the off - resonant transition on the first blue sideband ) is [ off4 ] p_b=|e|n+1|_1|g|n|^2= ^2 , where @xmath50 is given by eq .",
    "( [ off3 ] ) for the hamiltonian ( [ off1 ] ) .",
    "the probability to find the ion in the state @xmath51 corresponding to the off - resonant transition on the first red sideband is given as [ off5 ] p_r=|e|n-1|_1|g|n|^2= ^2 .",
    "if there is no population transferred via the off - resonant transitions to the states @xmath49 and @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath52 and @xmath53 at any time @xmath54 , we can neglect these off - resonant transitions .",
    "then we get the conditions of the weak coupling regime for the transition on the carrier in the form [ off6 ] ||and [ off7 ] || .",
    "we can also avoid the off - resonant transitions by setting the laser beam perpendicular to the @xmath55 axis ( @xmath56 ) . then the lamb - dicke parameter [ see eq .",
    "( [ int5 ] ) ] is equal to zero ( @xmath57 ) and the coupling on the off - resonant transitions vanishes .",
    "analogically , we can assume the laser to be tuned on the first red sideband ( @xmath58 ) and the closest off - resonant transitions are on the carrier and on the second red sideband [ fig.[off](b ) ] .",
    "however , the strength of the second red sideband is of the order of @xmath59 and we can omit it in the lamb - dicke limit",
    ". then the respective hamiltonian is given as [ off8 ] _",
    "2= ( i)_++ _ + e^it+ .",
    "the probability to find the ion ( initially in the state @xmath47 ) in the state @xmath60 ( after the off - resonant transition on the carrier ) can be calculated as [ off9 ] p_c=|e|n|_2|g|n|^2= ^2 , where @xmath61 is given by eq .",
    "( [ off3 ] ) for the hamiltonian ( [ off8 ] ) .",
    "we can neglect the off - resonant dynamics if @xmath62 at any time @xmath54 .",
    "then for the weak coupling regime on the first red sideband applies [ off11 ] || . even though the transition on the carrier is off - resonant , it has stronger coupling in the lamb - dicke limit than the first red sideband",
    ". therefore , it is very important to follow in the experiment the constraint given by eq .",
    "( [ off11 ] ) .      besides the population of the off - resonant levels",
    "there is another source of imprecisions in the state manipulation .",
    "however , it is weaker and it does nt require any special constraints on physical parameters except those for the weak coupling regime . when the laser drives a transition between two levels",
    "there appears a frequency shift called _ stark light shift _ caused by the presence of other spectator levels .",
    "therefore , in the experiment we have to consider the detuning ( [ int9.0 ] ) rather in the form [ off20 ] = _ l-_0- , where @xmath63 corresponds to the stark light shift .",
    "the higher the laser intensity , the more significant the light shift is .",
    "we can correct for this effect by shifting the laser frequency ( @xmath64 ) which tunes the transition back to the resonance .",
    "further , we will estimate the frequency shift @xmath63 .",
    "let us consider the hamiltonian ( [ int3 ] ) and transform it to the interaction picture ( [ int6 ] ) with @xmath65 , where @xmath66 .",
    "then we get [ off21 ] = _ 0+= ( -_z+)+ ( _ + e^i(+)+ ) , where in the lamb - dicke limit the interaction term reduces to [ off22 ] _ + + ( i)_++ ( i)_++ with the first term corresponding to the transition on the carrier , the second term to the first blue sideband and the last one to the transition on the first red sideband . in the second order of the time - independent perturbation theory ( the first order gives no contribution ) we can write for the shift of the energy levels [ off23 ] e_|g|n&= & _ m(m - n ) and [ off24 ] e_|e|n&= & _ m(n - m ) .",
    "for instance , for the transition on the first red sideband ( @xmath58 ) we can calculate [ off25 ] e_|g|n-,e_|e|n-1 and the corresponding light shift can be estimated as [ off26 ] = ( e_|e|n-1-e_|g|n)/. if we choose @xmath67 and @xmath68 so that the condition ( [ off11 ] ) holds , then @xmath69 .",
    "in the relation for the coupling constant ( [ int15 ] ) we can expand the exponential function to the taylor series about the value @xmath70 and use the expression ( [ int16 ] ) for the laguerre polynomial . then we get [ ldl1 ] _",
    "j^n , k()&= & _ j ( i_j)^|k| + & & , where @xmath71 denotes the terms proportional to the fourth and higher powers of @xmath72 . in the _ lamb - dicke regime _",
    "we consider the dependence of @xmath73 on the parameter @xmath72 only to its lowest order , i.e. in eq .",
    "( [ ldl1 ] ) we neglect all terms with any higher power than @xmath74 and we get the coupling constant @xmath73 given by the expression ( [ int20 ] ) .",
    "this approximation can be done only if the conditions [ ldl2 ] 1 and [ ldl3 ] _ j^2 ( n+|k|n-1)(n+|k|n)_j^21 are satisfied .",
    "we will refer to the condition ( @xmath75 ) [ ldl4 ] _ j1 as the _ lamb - dicke limit _",
    ", where @xmath76 is the average number of phonons in the respective vibrational mode @xcite .",
    "* the lamb - dicke limit corresponds physically to the situation where the spatial extent of the vibrational motion of the ion @xmath77 is much smaller than the wavelength @xmath78 of the laser , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 [ see def . in eq .",
    "( [ int5 ] ) ] . *",
    "the lamb - dicke limit can be physically interpreted also from a different point of view .",
    "we may rewrite the lamb - dicke parameter of the @xmath46 ion of @xmath19 ions in the com mode to the form @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the recoil energy .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the trapped ion emits spontaneously photons of the average energy @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is for the atomic frequency .",
    "taking into account the lamb - dicke limit ( @xmath85 ) we may say that during the spontaneous emission the change in the vibrational state of the ion is very unlikely .",
    "in other words , the trapped ion in the lamb - dicke regime decays spontaneously mostly on the carrier @xmath86 . *",
    "the lamb - dicke parameter for a single trapped ion equals to @xmath87 and for an ion from the string of @xmath19 ions in the com mode is given as @xmath88 .",
