    "given the diversity of spatial patterns one observe in nature , it is always puzzling to wonder how this diversity arises from spatially uniform situations .",
    "this question was pursued by a. turing in his seminal 1950 s paper on the mechanism of morphogenesis @xcite , in which he considered how can a spatially homogeneous state lose stability , giving origin to a spatially non - homogeneous pattern , the so - called turing instability .",
    "turing analyzed a reaction - diffusion system comprised of spatially coupled ordinary differential equations that modelled discrete biological cells .",
    "turing put forward two basic assumptions : ( i ) the need of at least two chemical substances ( morphogenes ) , an activator and an inhibitor ; ( ii ) diffusion plays a destabilizing role in the interacting chemical substances .",
    "the latter point is somewhat counterintuitive , for diffusion usually smooths out spatial structures in linear systems and thus would be expected to exert a stabilizing influence instead .",
    "moreover , turing found that the instability caused by diffusion leads to the growth of spatial structure at a particular wave length .",
    "this mechanism has explained successfully a wealth of pattern formation phenomena in nature , like the segmentation patterns in the developing fly embryo , the periodic array of tentacles around the mouth of the hydra , zebra stripes @xcite , sea shell striations @xcite , to name just a few . in physical chemistry turing instability",
    "has been found in many continuously fed stirred tank reactors , like the chlorine dioxide - iodine - malonic acid reaction @xcite .    from the mathematical point of view , turing instability arises when an otherwise stable homogeneous state becomes unstable as a result of diffusion , in the sense that any small perturbation will develop a spatially nonuniform state .",
    "linear theory can predict the wave length of the unstable mode which grows @xcite .",
    "this growth , however , is limited by the saturating effect of nonlinear terms and a spatially non - homogeneous pattern is then formed as a result of turing instability .",
    "turing instability is usually investigated in the context of local couplings , in which each cell interacts with its nearest - neighbors only .",
    "this is modelled by fick s law , in which the diffusive flux of morphogenes ( activator and inhibitor ) is proportional to their local concentration , being responsible for the second spatial derivatives in the mathematical models of such reaction - diffusive systems . however , there are many situations in which this picture is over - simplified , like in chemical couplings between biological cells , generating non - local interactions which can not be described by a diffusive coupling .",
    "non - local couplings can be implemented in macroscopic density equations in which the diffusion coefficient depends on a weighted spatial average of the density @xcite .",
    "such nonlocal couplings take into account not only the nearest neighbors of a given cell , but also the other cells of the assembly .",
    "an extreme form of this arises when each cell couples with the mean field produced by all the other cells , the so - called global ( all - to - all ) coupling , which is used in models of neural networks @xcite , coupled josephson junctions @xcite , and it is the basis of the paradigmatic kuramoto model @xcite .",
    "it is possible to interpolate between nearest - neighbor and all - to - all coupling by considering an interaction term whose strength decreases with the physical distance between cells as a power - law @xcite .",
    "this model has been used to theoretical and numerical studies of various spatio - temporal phenomena like synchronization , shadowing and cluster formation @xcite .",
    "the influence of non - local couplings on the formation of turing patterns has been studied in many systems .",
    "the conditions for the occurrence of turing instability were investigated for logistic growth processes using various non - local coupling terms @xcite .",
    "in other recent study , a three - variable oregonator model of a light - sensitive belousov - zhabotinsky reaction was studied , in which the nonlocal coupling was externally imposed by an optical feedback loop @xcite . in the latter investigation , it was found that long - range inhibition leads to turing instability , whereas long - range activation induces wave - like patterns .",
    "this work aims to investigate the presence of turing instabilities in oscillator chains with a non - local coupling of the power - law form , so as to have results which hold both for local and global cases .",
    "we derive analytically the conditions for a turing instability to occur in a one - dimensional lattice of two - dimensional systems ( representing the activator - inhibitor pair ) undergoing linear dynamics",
    ". then we study a nonlinear reaction - diffusion system proposed by meinhardt and gierer @xcite as a model for pattern formation related to skin pigmentation .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the oscillator model to be studied , as well as the type of coupling between the units .",
    "the analytical conditions for a turing instability to occur are derived in section iii using linear stability theory .",
    "the effect of nonlinear terms and the ensuing pattern formation is discussed in section iv through the meinhardt - gierer model .",
    "our conclusions are left to the last section .",
    "let us consider an oscillator one - dimensional chain with @xmath0 units , each of them being a nonlinear reaction - diffusion system , whose dynamical state is described by the concentrations of the activator @xmath1 and inhibitor @xmath2 , satisfying the following equations ( @xmath3 ) : [ chainx ] x_k & = & * x*(x_k , y_k ) - d_x x_k + _ r=1^n ( x_k - r + x_k+r ) , + [ chainy ] y_k & = & * y*(x_k , y_k ) - d_y y_k + _ r=1^n ( y_k - r + y_k+r ) , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 stand for the vector field corresponding to the uncoupled oscillators .",

    "the other limiting case , @xmath14 , is such that @xmath15 and the oscillator chain becomes globally coupled [ chainxg ] x_k & = & * x*(x_k , y_k ) + d_x ( - x_k + _ r=1,rk^n x_r ) , + [ chainyg ] y_k & = & * y*(x_k , y_k ) + d_y ( - y_k + _",

    "( [ chainx])-([chainy ] ) may be regarded as an interpolating form between these limiting cases , and will be referred to as a _ power - law coupling_.",
    "let us consider the equilibrium values of the activator and inhibitor given , respectively , by @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the deviations from these values ( also denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , for notational simplicity ) , in lowest order , obey a linearized model , for which the activator - inhibitor dynamics in each uncoupled oscillator ( labelled by @xmath20 , as before ) is governed by the affine vector field [ activator ] * x*(x_k , y_k ) & = & a x_k + b y_k , + [ inhibitor ] * y*(x_k , y_k ) & = & c x_k + d y_k , where the constants @xmath21 to @xmath22 are the elements of the jacobian matrix of the nonlinear vector field , evaluated at @xmath23 .",

    "we thus conclude that turing instability would be statistically more common for local couplings than for global ones .",
    "in reaction - diffusion systems of practical interest , there are nonlinear terms which exert saturation on the non - homogeneous spatial modes excited by the turing instability , giving rise to pattern formation .",
    "the basic mechanism of this saturation combines a short - ranged auto - catalytic activation , which causes self - enhancement after turing instability sets in , with a long - ranged inhibitory effect .",

    "in other words , as the effective coupling range increases , the more stable are the spatial configurations and , statistically speaking , less probable would be the occurrence of a turing instability .    this fact can be qualitatively understood by noting that global couplings spread information among cells more rapidly than locally coupled ones , for which diffusion happens at a slower rate",
