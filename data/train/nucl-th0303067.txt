    "it is now well established that spin observables are more appropriate than unpolarized cross sections for discriminating between different physical processes partaking in nuclear reactions @xcite .",
    "different spin observables usually exhibit selective sensitivity to different physical effects and , hence , in order to test the validity of a theoretical model , it is advisable to measure as many independent spin observables as possible or , at the very least one needs to identify ( via model predictions ) specific observables which can potentially address the physical problem of interest .",
    "one of the most challenging problems in nuclear physics is to understand how the properties of the strong interaction are modified inside nuclear matter .",
    "various theoretical models @xcite predict the modification of meson - nucleon coupling constants as well as nucleon and meson masses by normal nuclear matter . at present",
    "there is no overwhelming experimental evidence supporting these predictions .",
    "however , we believe that exclusive ( @xmath14 ) reactions - whereby an incident polarized proton knocks out a bound proton from a specific orbital in the nucleus and the two scattered protons , one of which is polarized , are detected in coincidence - are ideally suited for studying the behavior of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction in the nuclear medium . by exploiting the discriminatory nature of independent spin observables for the knockout protons from deep to low - lying single particle states in nuclei",
    ", one can in principle extract information about the density dependence of the nn interaction in a model - dependent fashion . indeed , with the recent developments in the production of polarized proton beams and the construction of high resolution spectrometers with focal plane polarimeters",
    ", it is possible to measure complete sets of polarization transfer observables which relate the components of a scattered polarized proton beam to the corresponding components of an incident proton beam which is polarized in an arbitrary direction [ see sec .",
    "( [ sec : spinobs ] ) ] .    to date",
    "most exclusive proton knockout data have been analyzed within the framework of the distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) , the main ingredients of which are the scattering wave functions for the incoming and two outgoing protons , the boundstate wave function of the struck proton in the target nucleus , and the interaction between the incident proton and bound proton .",
    "furthermore , the impulse approximation assumes that the form of the nn scattering matrix in the nuclear medium is the same as that for free nn scattering .",
    "the dwia also assumes that the main influence of the nuclear medium is to modify ( distort ) the scattering wave functions relative to their corresponding plane wave values for scattering in free space : nuclear distortion effects are incorporated via the inclusion of appropriate optical potentials , gauged by elastic scattering data , in the underlying equations of motion .    since the tremendous success of the relativistic mean - field theory @xcite for describing nuclear reactions and nuclear structure , there are serious concerns regarding the validity of nonrelativistic schrdinger - equation - based models in nuclear physics .",
    "in this paper , we focus on a relativistic description of exclusive ( @xmath15 ) spin observables .",
    "conventional wisdom claims that , since the binding energy of a nucleon in a nucleus is relatively small compared to the rest mass of a nucleon , relativistic effects are unimportant for nuclear structure problems , and hence the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation should provide an appropriate dynamical basis for nuclear physics studies . in recent years , however , the ability of quantum hadrodynamics , an effective relativistic field theory , to provide a mechanism for nuclear saturation and spin - orbit splitting in nuclei , has led to growing evidence that the relativistic dirac equation is the correct underlying dynamical equation . in particular , the small nuclear binding energy and the strength of the spin - orbit interaction both result from the subtle interplay between an attractive lorentz scalar ( attributed to the exchange of sigma mesons ) , with a strength of approximately @xmath16400 mev , and a repulsive vector potential ( attributed to the exchange of omega mesons ) with a strength of approximately @xmath17350 mev @xcite .",
    "recently , we demonstrated that the relativistic dwia provides an excellent description of analyzing power data for the knockout of protons from the 3s@xmath1 , 2d@xmath2 and 2d@xmath2 and states in @xmath4pb at an incident energy of 202 mev and for coincident coplanar scattering angles ( @xmath5,@xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "our motivation for choosing the @xmath4pb target and a relatively low incident energy of 202 mev was to maximize the influence of distortion effects , while still maintaining the validity of the impulse approximation , and also avoiding complications associated with the inclusion of recoil corrections in the relativistic dirac equation @xcite . in particular , we studied the effect of medium - modified coupling constants and meson masses on the above analyzing powers for both zero - range ( zr ) and finite - range ( fr ) approximations to the relativistic dwia . on one hand , the relativistic zr predictions suggested that the scattering matrix for nn scattering in the nuclear medium is adequately represented by the corresponding matrix for free nn scattering , without nuclear medium corrections . on the other hand ,",
    "the relativistic fr results imply that a 10% to 20% reduction of meson - coupling constants and meson masses by the nuclear medium is essential for providing a consistent description of the 3s@xmath1 , 2d@xmath2 and 2d@xmath3 analyzing powers .",
    "hence , within the context of the relativistic dwia , it is not clear whether nuclear - medium modifications are important or not .",
    "in addition , one needs to fully understand whether the differences between zr and fr calculations are attributed to essential physics or numerical errors due to extensive computational procedures associated with fr predictions ( compared to zr calculations ) . in refs .  @xcite it was also reported that the nonrelativistic schrdinger - equation dwia predictions completely fail to reproduce the 3s@xmath1 and 2d@xmath2 analyzing powers .",
    "systematic corrections to the nonrelativistic model - such as different kinematic prescriptions for the nn amplitudes , non - local corrections to the scattering wave functions , density - dependent modifications to the free nn scattering amplitudes , as well as the influence of different scattering and boundstate potentials - failed to remedy the nonrelativistic dilemma @xcite .",
    "although the analyzing power results seem to suggest that the dirac equation is the preferred dynamical equation , a more definite statement regarding the role of dynamics can only be made after comparing model predictions to complete sets of polarization transfer observables for proton knockout from a variety of states in nuclei .",
    "in addition , such a comparison will deepen our understanding of the influence of the nuclear medium effects on the nn interaction as well as shed light on the role of fr versus zr effects in exclusive proton knockout reactions .",
    "unfortunately , there are no published spin observable data , other than the analyzing power , for the reaction kinematics of interest . in an effort to demonstrate the unique ability of polarization data , and in particular data on complete sets of polarization transfer observables , to selectively address many of the above - mentioned physics issues ,",
    "we present the first relativistic and nonrelativistic predictions of complete sets of polarization transfer observables for exclusive proton knockout from the 3s@xmath1 , 2d@xmath2 and 2d@xmath3 states in @xmath4pb , at an incident laboratory kinetic energy of 202 mev , and for coincident coplanar scattering angles ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) .",
    "more specifically we investigate the sensitivity of these observables to fr versus zr approximations to the relativistic dwia as well as medium - modified meson - nucleon coupling constants and meson masses . in order to reliably extract information on the latter",
    "it is necessary to minimize model - input uncertainties .",
    "the most likely source of uncertainty could be related to ambiguities associated with the choice of global optical potential parameters for generating the incident and outgoing scattering wave functions : different global parameter sets are constrained by different sets of experimental data for elastic proton - nucleus scattering . for a heavy target nucleus such as @xmath4pb the effect of nuclear distortion is to reduce the unpolarized triple differential cross section to about 5% of its plane wave value : differences in optical potential parameter sets translate to an uncertainty of 10% in the latter cross sections @xcite .",
    "the question arises as to how sensitive polarization transfer observables are to nuclear distortion and , in particular , to different optical potential parameter sets .",
    "current qualitative arguments suggest that , since polarization transfer observables are ratios of polarized cross sections , distortion effects on the scattering wave functions effectively cancel , and hence simple plane wave models ( ignoring nuclear distortion ) should be appropriate for studying polarization phenomena @xcite .",
    "recently we demonstrated that , contrary to intuition , the ( @xmath18 ) analyzing power is extremely sensitive to nuclear distortion within the context of the relativistic dwia @xcite .",
    "the analyzing power is , however , relatively insensitive to different global dirac optical potential parameter sets . in this paper",

    "( [ e - tjlm ] ) , ensures numerical stability and rapid convergence ( and hence faster computational time ) .",
    "another advantage of the zr approximation is that one can directly employ experimental nn scattering amplitudes , rather than rely on a relativistic meson - exchange model , and hence , one is insensitive to uncertainties associated with interpolations and/or extrapolations of the limited meson - exchange parameter sets . in this paper",

    "an attractive feature of the @xmath59 approximation is selfconsistency , that is , the hlf model is used for generating both nn scattering amplitudes and optical potentials .",
    "however , for the kinematic region of interest to this paper , we consider it inappropriate to employ microscopic @xmath59 optical potentials , the reason being that hlf parameter sets only exist at 135 mev and 200 mev , whereas optical potentials for the outgoing protons are required at energies ranging between 24 and 170 mev .",
    "thus , enforcing selfconsistency would involve large , and relatively crude , interpolations / extrapolations , leading to inaccurate predictions of the spin observables .",

    "the vertically hatched band represents the sensitivity of a particular fr - dwia spin observables to a reduction of meson - coupling constants and meson masses ranging from 0% to 20% of the free values .",
    "the dotted band represents the corresponding zr - dwia predictions . ]",
    "in this paper we have exploited the discriminatory nature of complete sets of polarization transfer observables ( p , a@xmath7 , d@xmath8 , d@xmath9 , d@xmath13 , d@xmath12 and d@xmath98 ) for exclusive ( @xmath15 ) reactions to address a number of important physics issues .",
    "one of our aims was to identify specific observables which can yield information on whether the relativistic dirac equation or the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation is the more appropriate dynamical equation for the description of polarization phenomena within the framework of distorted wave impulse - approximation models .",
    "in addition , we also studied the sensitivity of spin observables to nuclear distortion effects , finite - range ( fr ) versus zero - range ( zr ) approximations of the relativistic dwia , as well as to reductions of meson - nucleon coupling constants and meson masses by the surrounding nuclear medium in which the nn interaction occurs .",
    "in particular , we focused on proton knockout from the 3s@xmath1 , 2d@xmath2 and 2d@xmath3 states in @xmath4pb , at an incident laboratory kinetic energy of 202 mev , and for coincident coplanar scattering angles ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) .",
    "the motivation for choosing a heavy target nucleus , @xmath4pb , and a relatively low incident energy of 202 mev is to maximize the influence of distortion effects as well as maximize differences between fr and zr approximations to the relativistic dwia , while still maintaining the validity of the impulse approximation , and also avoiding complications associated with the inclusion of recoil corrections in the relativistic dirac equation .",
    "another important consideration for our choice of reaction kinematics is the availability of analyzing power data to provide initial constraints on current distorted wave models .",
    "unfortunately , there are no published data on other spin observables for the reaction kinematics of interest .",
    "previously , we established the clear superiority of relativistic dwia models , compared to the nonrelativistic dwia models , for describing exclusive ( @xmath99 ) analyzing powers @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we identify additional observables which display large differences to dirac- versus schrdinger - equation - based models and which need to be measured in order to check the consistency of the analyzing power predictions regarding the role of different dynamical models .",
    "in particular , for knockout from the 3s@xmath1 state the spin observables a@xmath7 , d@xmath8 and d@xmath9 exhibit large differences between dirac and schrdinger - based dwia models . on the other hand , for knockout from the 2d@xmath2 state the most sensitive observables to dynamical differences",
    "are d@xmath8 , d@xmath10 and d@xmath11 , whereas for 2d@xmath3 knockout the corresponding observables are d@xmath9 and d@xmath10 .    regarding observables which display large differences between fr and zr approximations to the relativistic dwia , we see that for knockout from the 3s@xmath1 state , the induced polarization , p , is the most sensitive , whereas d@xmath12 and d@xmath13 are the most sensitive observables for 2d@xmath2 and 2d@xmath3 knockout , respectively .",
    "we have also established that all polarization transfer observables are relatively insensitive to different global dirac optical potential parameter sets .",
    "in addition , by comparing relativistic dwia predictions to corresponding plane wave predictions , we also demonstrated the importance of distorting potentials for describing the oscillatory behavior of spin observables thus refuting , for the first time , qualitative arguments that spin observables are insensitive to nuclear distortion effects .",
    "we have also shown that the analyzing power data alone are unable to establish whether the nuclear medium does indeed reduce meson - nucleon coupling constants and meson masses : on one hand , the relativistic zr predictions suggest that the scattering matrix for nn scattering in the nuclear medium is adequately represented by the corresponding matrix for free nn scattering .",
    "on the other hand , the relativistic fr results suggest that a 10% to 20% reduction of meson - nucleon coupling constants and meson masses by the nuclear medium is essential for providing a consistent description of the 3s@xmath1 , 2d@xmath2 and 2d@xmath3 analyzing powers @xcite . in this paper",
    "we studied the sensitivity of the other polarization transfer observables to reductions in these parameters varying between 0% and 20% . for the knockout from all three states",
    "we see that a@xmath7 , p and d@xmath9 are very sensitive to reductions in the meson - coupling constants and meson masses .",
    "we also established a number of interesting model predictions for spin observables at the kinematic point corresponding to minimum recoil momentum . for 3s@xmath1 knockout the relativistic plane wave , zr - dwia and nonrelativistic dwia predictions are virtually identical for the induced polarization ( p ) , d@xmath13 and d@xmath10 ; zr - dwia and fr - dwia predictions are nearly identical for both d@xmath8 and d@xmath95 . for knockout from the 2d@xmath2 state both fr - dwia and zr - dwia yield similar results for p , d@xmath9 and d@xmath13 ; p and d@xmath9 are insensitive to relativistic nuclear distortion at the point in question .",
    "we also observe that for 2d@xmath3 knockout , relativistic plane wave , fr - dwia and nonrelativistic dwia predictions are virtually identical for d@xmath13 and d@xmath12 .",
    "regarding the influence of nuclear medium effects , the spin observables d@xmath8 , d@xmath13 and d@xmath98 are insensitive for 3s@xmath1 knockout . on the other hand , for the 2d@xmath2 and 2d@xmath3 states , d@xmath13 and d@xmath98 also exhibit minimal sensitivity to nuclear medium corrections at minimum recoil .",
    "this is also the case for d@xmath8 and d@xmath98 for the 2d@xmath3 state .",
    "hence , by measuring spin observables at minimum recoil momentum one can eliminate differences between different dynamical models and model parameters and focus on a specific issue of interest .",
    "once again , we stress the urgent need for experimental data on polarization observables , in addition to the commonly - measured analyzing power , in order to resolve issues concerning the role of relativistic versus nonrelativistic dynamics in nuclear physics , as well as study the influence of the nuclear medium on the strong interaction .",
