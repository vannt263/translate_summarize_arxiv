    "two - dimensional frustrated ising spin systems have been actively studied during the past few decades , because the spin frustration usually manifests itself at low enough temperatures through intriguing phase transitions and magnetic properties ( see refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the term _ spin frustration _ is ascribed to an incapability of spins to find an optimal spin configuration , which would simultaneously satisfy all interactions between spins .",
    "the spin frustration can arise either from a mutual competition between different interactions or from a geometric topology of the considered lattice .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that several two - dimensional frustrated ising models have been solved quite rigorously and those exact solutions have brought a deeper understanding into a variety of striking phenomena such as an existence of highly degenerate ground states with a non - zero residual entropy @xcite or reentrant phase transitions with a few successive critical points @xcite .",
    "the antiferromagnetic spin-@xmath0 ising model on a triangular lattice was presumably the first exactly solved model with the macroscopically degenerate ground state having a non - zero residual entropy @xcite , while the spin-@xmath0 ising model on a centered square ( union jack ) lattice with the competing ( antiferromagnetic ) next - nearest - neighbour interaction was likely the first exactly solved model showing reentrant phase transitions @xcite .",
    "an absence of finite - temperature phase transition above the highly degenerate ground state has been later rigorously proved for the spin-@xmath0 ising model on a kagom lattice @xcite , fully frustrated square , triangular and honeycomb lattices @xcite , brickwork lattice @xcite , chessboard lattice @xcite , pentagon lattice @xcite , triangular kagom lattice @xcite and others .    although it could be naively expected that the macroscopic degeneracy of the ground state ultimately inhibits spontaneous long - range order , some two - dimensional frustrated ising models with the highly ( but not too highly ) degenerate ground state exhibit a striking coexistence of spontaneous long - range order with a partial disorder .",
    "indeed , the exact solutions for the spin-@xmath0 ising model on a centered square lattice @xcite , piled - up and zig - zag domino lattices @xcite , centered honeycomb lattice @xcite and generalized kagom lattice @xcite have convincingly evidenced a presence of incomplete spontaneous order with a considerable value of the residual ( zero - point ) entropy . it is noteworthy that the reentrance with a few successive critical points is also observed in most of the aforementioned exactly solved ising models .",
    "besides , the spin-@xmath0 ising model on a domino lattice shows a spectacular phenomenon called as _ order - from - disorder effect _ @xcite , which refers to an imperfect spontaneous order that is thermally induced just above a disordered ground state . the fact that thermal fluctuations may produce a spontaneous order above a disordered ground state by selecting a state with the largest entropy obviously represents a highly contra - intuitive cooperative phenomenon .",
    "the mixed - spin ising models represent probably the most natural extensions of the simple spin-@xmath0 ising model .",
    "the foremost reason for a theoretical investigation of the mixed - spin ising models closely relates to a more diverse critical behaviour they usually display compared with their single - spin counterparts . despite a great effort , there are only a few exactly solved examples of the frustrated mixed - spin ising models on two - dimensional lattices so far . among these",
    ", one could mention the mixed - spin ising model on a honeycomb lattice @xcite , centered square lattice @xcite , diced lattice @xcite and decorated bethe lattice @xcite , in which the competing character of the further - neighbour interaction causes an appearance of reentrant phase transitions .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to exactly treat a mixed spin-(@xmath0 , 1 ) ising model on two fully frustrated triangles - in - triangles lattices , which provide a useful playground for investigating phase transitions induced by the spin frustration .",
    "the outline of the present paper is as follows . in section [ model ] , the model under investigation will be described in detail and basic steps of the exact solution will be clarified . in section",

    "the present article deals with the mixed spin-(@xmath0 , 1 ) ising model on two geometrically frustrated tit lattices , which has been exactly solved through the generalized star - triangle transformation establishing a rigorous mapping equivalence with the corresponding spin-@xmath0 ising model on a triangular lattice . within the framework of this precise mapping correspondence ,",
    "we have derived exact results for the partition function , the spontaneous magnetization of the nodal spins , the spontaneous magnetization and quadrupolar moment of the decorating spins along with the critical condition allocating critical points .",
    "it has been evidenced that the variety of ordered , disordered and ordered - disordered ground states emerge owing to a mutual interplay between the spin frustration and single - ion anisotropy , which is simultaneously responsible for a diverse critical behaviour including the order - from - disorder effect and reentrant phase transitions with either two or three successive critical points .",
    "although the exact treatment of the mixed spin-(@xmath0 , 1 ) ising model on two considered tit lattices differs just in a relative strength of the effective interaction of the corresponding spin-@xmath0 ising model on a triangular lattice , it turns out that this rather small technical difference might cause a significant change in a character of some ground states and the overall critical behaviour .",
