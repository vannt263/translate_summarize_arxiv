    "simultaneously , the slightly pressure - supported nature of the gas causes it to orbit at slightly sub - keplerian speeds , causing the dust to experience a head - wind .",
    "small grains are carried along with the gas through `` gas drag , '' while slightly larger particles lose substantial angular momentum to the gas and spiral inward through `` radial drift . ''    while the idea of radial drift has long been recognized to be important ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite recently demonstrated that gas drag and radial drift operating together result in a dust distribution that is sharply truncated at some small fraction of the full gas disk radius .",
    "for example , in their fiducial models , the gas extends beyond @xmath5s of au and the dust population ( assuming an initial grain size of @xmath6 ) , evolves inward , resulting in a sharp outer truncation of the dust disk at @xmath7  au at late times .",
    "these models provided a natural explanation for the well - characterized observational feature that many disks exhibit significantly concentrated and sharply truncated millimeter dust emission compared to their distribution of gas ( from co ) and/or small grains as traced by scattered light ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the evolving redistribution of solids , both vertical and radial , will have significant implications for the disk thermal structure and the propagation of radiation through the disk . in the case of vertical settling , more settled disks tend to have warmer intermediate layers and colder midplanes @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , the removal of small grains from the disk atmosphere will decrease the local fuv opacity , increasing the amount of gas exposed to stellar and external fuv photons , which enhances non - thermal desorption , drives photochemistry , and increases photodissociation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the radial transport of solids is expected to alter the outer disk in similar ways , changing the outer disk thermal structure as well as its opacity to external uv radiation . in the following letter",
    ", we explore the impact of radial drift on the global disk thermal structure using a simple two component dust model and examine the effects on the structure of the co snow - line for low - mass stars .",
    "we have adapted the parametric density models of the dust and gas distributions from @xcite , which reflect the typical self - similarity solutions of @xcite .",

    "the gas distribution is described by : @xmath8},\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the surface density at the critical radius @xmath10 . to simulate the effects of vertical settling ,",
    "we adopt a two component dust model that consists of two separate mrn @xcite dust populations : a large grain population of @xmath11 to @xmath12  mm distributed over small scale heights , and a second mixed population of @xmath13 and 10 micron - sized grains distributed with the same scale height as the gas ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for further details ) .",
    "we consider the percentage of mass in small grains a free parameter .",
    "the primary change in the present models from the previous treatment of @xcite is that we set the spatial distribution of the large grain population to have a different critical radius , @xmath14 , from the gas and small grains , along with an additional truncation radius , @xmath15 , to approximate the findings of the detailed models of @xcite with radial drift .",
    "we emphasize that this is a simple and flexible toy model and that more realistic , spatially dependent size distributions ( including all of the important dust physics ) should be explored in future work .",
    "for the large grains , we set @xmath16 , and emphasize that the choice of @xmath14 does not strongly affect the results of this paper , where the large grains have a relative flat vertical distribution close to the midplane ( see section  [ sec : discussion ] ) . the total gas mass is fixed over the models , @xmath17  m@xmath18 between @xmath19  au , with @xmath20  g  @xmath21 and @xmath22  au .",
    "the scale - height of the disk is 8  au at 100  au and varies as @xmath23 , with a flaring index of @xmath24 .",
    "we also assume that the total disk integrated gas - to - dust mass ratio is @xmath25 but varies with position .",
    "we conserve the total dust mass , such that truncating the outer distribution of large grains at a location @xmath15 correspondingly increases the dust mass density in large grains . in reality",
    ", some amount of dust can ( and likely will ) be lost through direct accretion onto the star .",
    "the effect of this assumption is that the truncated large grain disk will be slightly cooler by a few kelvin .",
    "the dust thermal structure is computed using the code torus @xcite , which utilizes the lucy method @xcite .",
    "we have explored two low mass spectral types , a k4 type star ( a future solar - type star ) and an m1 type star , with effective temperatures of 4300  k and 3700  k and luminosities of 2.44 and 0.87  l@xmath18 , respectively .",

    "we examine the temperature structure of the disk to predict the co freeze - out regions . in detail , the location of a given snow - line is set by the balance of thermal desorption matched to freeze - out on grains .",
    "this location depends upon the number of surface sites , their coverage by other ices , and the binding energy , @xmath26 , of the species .",

    "only the large grains are restricted to this smaller area , small grains are present throughout the extent of the gas distribution and contain 10% of the total dust mass in this figure .",
    "we have highlighted the temperature isocontours at @xmath36  k , @xmath37  k , and @xmath38  k. compared to the full disk model , the truncated disk has a more complex temperature profile .",
    "the full disk has a monotonically decreasing temperature profile with distance from the star , causing there to be one midplane snow - line for a particular choice of @xmath26 ( traced by the contour lines ) . by moving dust mass from the outer disk into the inner regions via radial drift",
    ", the opacity to the re - radiated stellar emission from the warm surface significantly drops .",
    "consequently , the outer disk beyond the truncation radius is heated more than it would otherwise be without radial drift .",
    "one of the most important implications of the non - monotonic temperature profile in the drift case is that for reasonable assumptions , the outer disk can become warm enough to thermally desorb co beyond the classical co snow - line in the inner disk , typically observed in t  tauri systems to occur near @xmath1  au . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : zoom ] , for @xmath39  k , co thermally desorbs outside of @xmath35  au even at the midplane , and only starts to freeze out again at @xmath40au , where geometrical dilution of the stellar radiation field takes over .",
    "to test under what conditions this second co evaporation front arises , we have varied the fraction of small grains and the central star s spectral type , figure  [ fig : therm ] . for the m - star ( 3700  k )",
    ", decreasing the small grain mass fraction from 10% to 1% makes the intermediate layers of the disk warmer , and increases the extent of the outer co sublimation region , spanning from 80 to 400  au for @xmath41  k , and 80 to 120  au for @xmath42  k. for the highest value of the co desorption temperature , @xmath43  k , the co desorption does not reach the outer disk midplane .    increasing the stellar mass to a young sun - like",
    "star ( @xmath44  k ) also increases the size of the co sublimation region , making the entire disk warmer than 17  k , except for a small region between @xmath45  au . if we instead assume @xmath46  k , co is frozen out from @xmath47  au and beyond @xmath48  au . decreasing the small grain dust fraction increases this second co freeze out region to beyond",
    "au .",
    "it is also of interest to compare thermal desorption to fuv photodesorption from the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , which is typically thought to dominate co desorption in the outer disk . to test their relative importance",
    ", we calculate the flux of desorbed molecules due to thermal processes , i.e. , eq .",

    "( 2 ) of @xcite , and @xmath54 is the surface fraction covered by co. for the rate of thermal desorption , @xmath53 , we take @xmath27  k , i.e. , that of co - co .",
    "we then calculate the flux of photodesorbed co molecules from the isrf with eq .",
    "( 6 ) of @xcite , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the yield in molecules per photon and @xmath57 is the photon flux incident on the grain .",
    "the mean isrf is parameterized in units of @xmath58 , @xmath59  photons  @xmath21  s@xmath60 between 6 and 13.6  ev @xcite .",
    "we estimate the absorption opacity to each point in the disk from external radiation with the method of @xcite appendix  a. this method samples the optical depth along rays that are uniformly spaced over @xmath61 steradian and computes the `` effective '' optical depth ( @xmath62 ) that a grain would see at a given location .",
    "this treatment better reflects the radiation field that the disk molecules experience compared to taking only the optical depth from the surface , which naturally underestimates the extinction .",
    "the @xmath62 curves are shown in figure  [ fig : uvtau ] ( top ) for both the truncated and full disks . at a given location ,",
    "the optical depth of the outer disk is generally lower for the truncated disk with radial drift , as we would expect .",
    "note that it does not move all the way inward to the truncation radius since there are still small grains out to the gas disk radius .",
    "we compute the local flux , @xmath63 , and adopt a value for the yield of photodesorbed co of @xmath64  molecules  photon@xmath60 , which is appropriate for the fuv photodesorption experiments of @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : uvtau ] ( bottom ) compares the relative desorption fluxes from the isrf to thermal processes ( @xmath65 ) for the @xmath66 case .",
    "large values correspond to efficiency in each process , i.e. , regions of the disk where @xmath65 is large implies photodesorption dominates thermal desorption and vice versa . in all models",
    ", thermal desorption dominates the inner disk and transitions to photodesorption in the outer disk .",
    "we find that the transition is substantially further out for the drift - dominated model and that the transition occurs rapidly . in the case with drift , thermal desorption dominates isrf photodesorption inside of @xmath67  au and for the full disk the transition occurs at @xmath7  au .",
    "these results are non - obvious , as radial drift increases outer disk heating but also decreases the opacity to external fuv .",
    "we find similar results for 1% small grain mass case , with values of 400  au ( drift ) and 70  au ( full ) , respectively .",
    "based on these results , we expect radial drift to alter the disk temperature profile and enhance thermal desorption of co in the outer disk",
    ". to approximately estimate the enhancement in co column density , we take the temperature profile and assign a co abundance of @xmath68 per h@xmath29 for dust temperatures between 17  k and 200  k. we calculate the vertically integrated column density of co versus radius and then compare the models with and without drift , and find the maximum enhancement in co column is @xmath69 times higher outside of the large grain radius .",
    "recently , observations of i m  lup have shown multiple rings of dco@xmath70 , a direct product of co - driven chemistry @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite report multiple co ring structures in both @xmath71co and @xmath72co in gg  tau .",
    "radial temperature variations increasing co sublimation in the outer disk may be contributing to these structures , though they should be modeled in detail to test non - thermal vs. thermal desorption scenarios .",
    "the extra co sublimation changes the c / o ratio in the gas and ice in the outer disk .",
    "similar to the calculations of @xcite , we can estimate the c / o ratio in solids at the midplane . in a disk with",
    "well mixed gas and dust and a single co snow - line , the c / o ratio in ices beyond the co snow - line should be near the solar value because the main volatile sources of carbon and oxygen are fully frozen - out .",
    "the `` re - sublimation '' of co beyond the truncation radius causes the c / o ratio in the gas to return to unity in this radial zone between the co freeze - out regions , and correspondingly , the c / o ratio in the ice drops to sub - solar values , @xmath73 .",
    "we also explore how our results depend on the particular choices of model parameters in figure  [ fig : paramtest ] .",
    "we vary the distribution of mass ( @xmath74 in eq .",
    "[ eq : sig ] ) ; pure power law models in gas and dust normalized to the same disk mass ; the gas scale height ; and the flaring index , @xmath75 , where larger values are more flared .",
    "we find the general structure of gas - phase co in the inner disk , freeze - out in the large grain disk , re - sublimation beyond the truncation radius , and freeze - out again at large radii are robust features of the models , though in detail the snow - line locations will in change with the particular choice of parameters .",
    "the second snow - line disappears for the very flat disk case , @xmath76 , where the disk is very dense and cold .",
    "these results apply to full disk models ; however , there have been many recent observations of disks with large inner cavities in the dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has been previously seen that removing the inner disk does lead to a warmer disk near the inner edge @xcite . in combination with the outer disk heating , in principle the inner `` classical '' snow - line could disappear inside of the truncation radius , leaving only the outer disk snow - line at @xmath5s of au .",
    "these effects may lead to the appearance of more distant snow - lines than the star might otherwise support for a full , non - transitional disk .",
    "we have also calculated a temperature structure model for a herbig - type disk with a @xmath77  k star and twice the gas mass ( 1% small grain model ) . in our models with drift",
    ", co is present in the gas - phase everywhere .",
    "nonetheless , there is still a temperature increase outside of the 80  au truncation region , elevating the disk temperature from @xmath78 to over 40  k. in this case , other molecules with higher desorption temperatures near 40  k , such as hcn , may exhibit rings at the truncation radius .    finally , after the discovery of ringed - structure in the hl  tau protostellar disk @xcite , there have been recent explorations matching the presence of rings to efficient dust - growth near prominent snow - lines @xcite or efficient ice - sintering ( dust - growth suppression ) near snow - lines @xcite .",
    "co is a major constituent of the c and o reservoir , and in principle the decreased ice - content between the two co - freeze out regions due to drift effects may regenerate small dust more efficiently by fragmenting collisions .",
    "however , it should be noted that these grains can still be water - ice coated and should still be generally `` sticky . ''",
    "a more detailed exploration of dust growth in the context of multiple snow - line structures is beyond the scope of this letter , but should be explored in future work .",
    "using simple parameterized disk models , we explore how a more compact large grain distribution relative to the distributions of gas and small grains alters the temperature structure of the outer disk .",
    "such distributions are a natural outcome of a combination of radial drift and gas drag @xcite and are a commonly observed phenomenon .",
    "we find that the removal of dust mass from the outer disk causes this region to become sufficiently warm to support direct thermal desorption of co. in our models with a large - grain truncation radius at 80  au ( based on the findings of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , co can thermally desorb from this radius out to @xmath79  au depending on properties of the star and disk .",
    "moreover , thermal desorption of co becomes competitive with external uv photodesorption from the interstellar radiation field .",
    "these results have important implications for the gas versus solid state c / o ratios of protoplanetary disks , where co is a major carbon and oxygen reservoir .      ,",
