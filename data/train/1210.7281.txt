    "several additional subclasses have been identified , including interacting sne  iin ( see e.g. schlegel 1990 , kiewe et al .",
    "2012 and references therein ) , linearly declining sne iil , plateau light curve sne iip , h - deficient sne iib and events displaying long rise times similar to sn1987a .",

    "2012 for recent results ) . however , while rsgs in the local group have masses up to @xmath4 ( levesque et al .",
    "2005 ) , smartt et al .",
    "( 2009 ) find that none of the observed progenitors of confirmed sne  iip are more massive than @xmath5 .",
    "it is unclear why no rsg with a mass in the range @xmath6 has been observed to explode as a type  iip event , and this discrepancy has been dubbed the `` rsg problem '' .    assuming a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) , smartt et al .",
    "( 2009 ) find that the probability of their sample not including any sn from a massive rsg by chance is very low ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the imf alone is therefore not enough to resolve this problem .",
    "massive rsgs might explode as sne iil , iib or iin , but so far these sne were found to arise from lower mass progenitors ( smartt et al .",
    "2003 ) , binaries ( podsiadlowski et al . 1993",
    "; woosley et al . 1994 ; maund et al . 2004 ) and luminous blue variables ( gal - yam & leonard 2009 ) , respectively . other options could be that massive rsgs are enshrouded by thick dust , making their explosions difficult to detect , or that they collapse directly to black holes .",
    "one possible exception to the rsg problem is sn2003ie , for which only a loose progenitor mass upper limit ( @xmath8 ) could be derived .",
    "however , due to the sparse data available for this sn , its subclass could not be determined .",
    "determining whether sn2003ie was a type  iip event or not could have implications for the rsg problem , thus motivating this study .",
    "sn2003ie was discovered on 2003",

    "( 2003 ) revealed it was a type  ii sn .",
    "harutyunyan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) find that the spectrum was similar to that of sn1998a .",
    "both sn2003ie and sn1998a show a significant ( @xmath9km / s ) blueshift in their halpha emission line .",
    "this prompted the suggestion that sn2003ie , like sn1998a , is a member of the slowly rising sn1987a - class .",
    "these events are thought to arise from blue supergiants ( bsgs ; kleiser et al .",
    "2011 , pastorello et al .",
    "2012 , taddia et al .",
    "indeed sn1987a had a massive bsg progenitor ( @xmath10 ; arnett et al .",
    "1989 ) . if this were the case , sn2003ie would not be of any relevance to the rsg problem . however , pastorello et al .",
    "( 2005 ) note that blueshifted halpha emission has also been observed in the type  iip sn1999em .",
    "it is therefore not clear which subclass of type ii events sn2003ie belongs to .",
    "here we present @xmath11 photometry of sn2003ie obtained serendipitously during observations of its host galaxy , ngc 4051 .",
    "our data cover approximately 130 days starting one month prior to discovery .",
    "we compare the light curve of this event to those of other sne in order to better constrain its subtype .",
    "we used the the ap7p ccd camera mounted on the 70-cm telescope at the crimean astrophysical observatory to observe the galaxy ngc 4051 during the months of july 2003 to january 2004 ( see segeev et al .",

    "the possiblity of a massive bsg progenitor for sn2003ie is therefore disfavoured .    while the drop from the plateau for sn2003ie is more gradual than some other sne  iip , it is still far from the type  iil and type  iib light curve templates identified by arcavi et al .",

    "several other faint type  iip sne had relatively low mass progenitors ( see fraser et al .",

    "therefore , we conclude that this event is not likely to have been the explosion of a high mass rsg .",
    "we have presented new photometric observations of sn2003ie , which strongly suggest it was a faint type  iip event . despite the spectroscopic similarities to sn1998a ( harutyunyan et al .",

    "our work demonstrates that using core collapse sn light curve templates could prove usefull for transient identification when only sparse photometric and spectroscopic data is available .",
