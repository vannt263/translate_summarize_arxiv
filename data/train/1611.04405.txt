    "a ( genus-@xmath4 ) lefschetz fibration @xcite is a smooth map @xmath5 from a closed smooth 4-manifold @xmath6 that is a @xmath7-fiber bundle projection away from finitely many singular points . here , @xmath8 is the closed surface of genus @xmath4 , and the map near the singular points is required to appear in appropriate oriented local complex coordinates as @xmath9 lefschetz fibrations provide a topological method available for studying 4-dimensional geometry , such as complex surfaces , symplectic structures and stain surfaces .",
    "further , a careful observation of tubular neighborhoods around the singular fibers develops the close relation to 3-dimensional contact geometry and the mapping class group , @xmath2 , of @xmath8 ; see an explanatory book @xcite for details .",
    "we now explain an approach to lefschetz fibrations , as a general setting from hurwitz equivalence problem .",
    "let @xmath0 be a group with identity @xmath10 , and let a subset @xmath11 be closed under conjugation . for @xmath12",
    ", consider the quotient set , @xmath13 , of the set @xmath14 modulo the following relations : @xmath15 @xmath16 for any @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "each element of this set @xmath19 is called a _",
    "hurwitz equivalence class _ , and is roughly viewed as a monodromy characterized by @xmath0 over the 2-sphere @xmath20 with @xmath21-points removed .",
    "this viewpoint emphasised the importance of computing and classifying @xmath13 ; as examples in topology , in the case where @xmath0 is the mapping class group @xmath3 ( resp .",
    "the braid group @xmath22 ) , the associated set @xmath13 is bijective to the set of isomorphism classes of lefschetz fibrations ( resp . of simple surface - braids ) ; see e.g. @xcite , examples [ lfrei ] and [ surfacebraidrei ] . nevertheless ,",
    "for any group @xmath0 , there are few invariants with respect to the hurwitz equivalence , although the definition is seemingly simple . for instance , even concerning lefschetz fibrations related to symplectic geometry , most of useful approaches are ( geometric ) characteristic classes , group - theoretic study for the monodromy ; see , e.g , @xcite ( refer to a recent work @xcite from  chart diagrams \" ) .    in this paper , for such any pair @xmath11 , we generally introduce an algorithm to provide invariants of hurwitz equivalence classes @xmath13 .",
    "the idea follows from the hopf fibration @xmath23 .",
    "since the preimage of @xmath21-points on @xmath20 is the @xmath24-torus link @xmath25 in @xmath26 , as a lift , our invariants are roughly defined as link - invariants of the link @xmath25 . to be precise ,",
    "we show that ( lemma [ aa53 ] ) any invariant of representations of link groups yields an invariant of @xmath13 .",
    "thus , for concrete computations and applications of such invariants , this paper mainly employs the link - invariant @xmath27 which was defined by the author @xcite ( see  [ ss211 ] for the reason why this paper does not use other standard link - invariants ) .",
    "the interesting point is that the link - invariant @xmath27 is elementally constructed from any @xmath0-module @xmath1 and any @xmath0-invariant bilinear function @xmath28 , and is valued as a bilinear form .",
    "hence , in conclusion , we obtain bilinear forms from @xmath13 as mentioned in the abstract above .    for their applications",
    ", this paper mainly focuses on lefschetz fibrations over @xmath20 . as mentioned above",
    ", we shall let @xmath0 be the mapping class group @xmath29 .",
    "then , by virtue of bilinear form theory ( see @xcite ) and the help of computer , we can compute the invariants of many lefschetz fibrations of low genus fibers ( see  [ ssg2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in  [ ss2119]-[ssg2 ] , we study properties of the bilinear forms , and obtain some interesting results as follows .    as the simplest case , in  [ ssg2 ] , we study the resulting bilinear form @xmath27 obtained from the standard symplectic representation of @xmath2 , that is , we set @xmath30 and the symplectic form @xmath28 on @xmath1 .",
    "we then analyze the rational part and torsion part in turn .",
    "first , in rational case @xmath31 , one will show the unimodularity of the form @xmath27 ( theorem [ aa333c ] ) , and show that the signature of @xmath27 is essentially equal to the signature of the total space of the lefschetz fibration . as a result",
    ", we give a simpler formula for computing 4-dimensional signature ( this formula is a modification of meyer 2-cocycle @xcite ; see appendix [ asss303k1 ] for details ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath32 is the torsion group @xmath33 for some prime @xmath34 , the resulting form @xmath27 are not topological , but capture some group theoretic fiber - structures of lefschetz fibrations .",
    "a typical evidence is that the form @xmath27 seems something unstable : precisely , it does not always have the additivity with respect to ( twist ) fiber sums of lefschetz fibrations ( this sum is a powerful tool for constructing new symplectic 4-manifolds ) .",
    "to clarify them , we focus on some lefschetz fibrations in @xcite constructed as fiber sums .",
    "then , following results in @xcite , we will find infinitely many non - isomorphic lefschetz fibrations which have the same seiberg - witten invariant and belong to the same homeomorphism class ( see theorem [ jfs ] ) .",
    "moreover , we emphasize that our invariants are applicable from the quantum representation .",
    "witten @xcite had made a prophetic discovery that the chern - simons quantum field theory of level @xmath35 produces 3-manifold invariants and representations of @xmath36 ; afterward the prophecy in some cases are mathematically formulated from several branches , e.g. , conformal field theory .",
    "here we remark that the formulation has a difficulty that , by an obstacle of  @xmath37-structures ( or 2-framing anomaly \" ; see @xcite ) , the resulting representation is a right module not of @xmath29 , but of a @xmath38-central extension of @xmath29 .",
    "however , starting from the study of such extensions ( see @xcite for its finite presentation ) , the quantum representation is shown to be applicable for our invariants .",
    "furthermore , the associated bilinear forms of lefschetz fibrations are computable in some cases .",
    "for instance , in  [ s3s331wlw ] , we compute the associated invariants with @xmath39-gauge of level 2 ( i.e. , a quantization of the spin structure on @xmath7 ) ; see table [ g3 ] for the computation . as a result",
    ", we can detect some pairs of non - isomorphic lefschetz fibrations ( proposition [ vbbw ] ) ; however , unfortunately , the invariants seem not so strong , in contrast with the jones knot - polynomial .    with respect to other gauges of higher level ,",
    "the bilinear forms @xmath27 arising from the quantum representations are entirely mysterious .",
    "however , compared with a tqft - like physical interpretation of the gromov - witten invariant , it may be worth for the futures to hope that the philosophy of chern - simons perturbative @xcite would partially produce invariants of 4-manifolds with somewhat structures , and that lefschetz fibrations would be good models which are affected by few 3-dimensional quantum obstructions .    * conventional notation*. throughout this paper , we write @xmath0 for a group , and do @xmath40 for a subset of @xmath0 as above . furthermore _",
    "an @xmath21-tuple ( of @xmath40 ) _ is @xmath41 with @xmath42 , and is denoted by @xmath43 .",
    "we denote by @xmath44 the oriented closed surface of genus @xmath45 with @xmath46-boundaries .",
    "by @xmath32 we mean a commutative ring with identity and with involution @xmath47 .",
    "we will describe explicitly an algorithm to get something invariant with respect to the hurwitz equivalence relation ; see the introduction for the definition of @xmath48 .    for this purpose , we start with a short review of the hopf fibration @xmath49 with fiber @xmath50 .",
    "the fibration is formulated by the restriction on @xmath26 of the following map : @xmath51 then we can easily see , by definitions , that the preimage of @xmath21-points , @xmath52 , is the @xmath24-torus link @xmath25",
    ". considering the euler class , we find a trialization of the @xmath50-bundle restricted on the complementary space @xmath53 , that is , a homeomorphism @xmath54 in particular , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the free group of rank @xmath57 .",
    "hence    [ aa51433 ] the complementary space @xmath58 is an eilenberg maclane space of @xmath59 .",
    "moreover , the wirtinger presentation yields a presentation of @xmath60 as follows : @xmath61 here , @xmath62 correspondences to the meridian associated to the arc @xmath63 in figure [ tg222 ] , and the product @xmath64 generates the summand @xmath65 .",
    "next , to explain lemma [ aa53 ] below , we now set up terminologies",
    ". wirtinger presentation in knot theory implies that every homomorphism from every link group to the group @xmath0 is formulated as a map @xmath66 .",
    "let us consider the set of such maps : @xmath67 further , we can equip @xmath68 with an equivalence relation by considering reidemeister moves .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the link - diagram @xmath69 of @xmath70 in the left hand side of figure [ tg222 ] . here , any entry of the linking matrix is @xmath71 , and the band in figure [ tg222 ] means the @xmath72-parallel strands , and the blackline is the @xmath73-th strand and the dotted line indicates the @xmath74-th strand .",
    "then , given an @xmath21-tuple @xmath75 with @xmath76 , the assignment @xmath77 defines a homomorphism @xmath78 according to .",
    "hence we have a map @xmath79    [ aa53 ] let @xmath80 be a set , and take a map @xmath81 .",
    "assume that @xmath82 is invariant with respect to reidemeister moves of type ii and iii , and assume that if two homomorphisms @xmath83 and @xmath84 coming from @xmath85 are conjugate , @xmath86 .",
    "then , the composite @xmath87 induces a map @xmath88 by passage to the relations .",
    "it suffices to check the invariance with respect to the relations .",
    "since the former is clear by assumption , we will discuss another .",
    "to this end , consider another diagram @xmath89 obtained from the above @xmath69 by exchanging the @xmath73-th strand for the @xmath74-th one ( see the right of figure [ tg222 ] ) ; notice that @xmath69 is related to @xmath89 by a finite sequence of reidemeister moves of type ii and iii ( see figure [ tg222 ] ) .",
    "therefore , if two @xmath21-tuples @xmath43 and @xmath90 are related by , then the equality @xmath91 results from the assumption .",

    "along the line using quandle theory as mentioned previous , section [ ss211 ] briefly formulates the invariants of linear forms .",
    "after that , in  [ ss2119 ] , we will state some properties of the bilinear forms .      in this subsection , we introduce invariants , which are of bilinear forms up to base change , with respect to the hurwitz equivalence .",

    "hence , according to lemma [ aa53 ] , we immediately conclude the following :    [ aa4221c ] the correspondence from @xmath120 to the bilinear form @xmath121 up to base change gives rise to invariants of the hurwitz equivalence classes .",

    "more precisely , regarding the relation , we define the map by @xmath126 .",
    "further , concerning another , we can verify the equality by setting @xmath127 although the verifications are slightly complicated .    as a consequence",
