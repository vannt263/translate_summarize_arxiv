    "complex network science revolves around the hypothesis that the behavior of complex systems can be explained in terms of the structural and functional relationships between their components by means of a graph representation @xcite .",
    "the network framework provides cue into whether the structural environment confers opportunities for or constraints on individual action @xcite .",
    "social network formation is a complex process in which individuals create and deactivate social ties in order to simultaneously satisfy their goals under multiple ( possibly conflicting ) constraints .",
    "dynamics of social behaviors ranging from opinions , cultural and linguistic traits , crowd behavior , hierarchy formation , social spreading and human dynamics and their connections have been investigated using various tools of statistical physics @xcite .",
    "essential to understanding the behavior of humans within their socio - economical environment is the observation that they simultaneously play different roles in various interconnected social networks , such as friendship networks , communication networks , family , or business networks @xcite .",
    "this superposition of a number of networks is often termed as multilayer networks @xcite . in a multilayer network ,",
    "on one hand , actions of individuals help in defining the topological structure of networks , and on the other hand , the topology constrains and shapes the possible actions of individuals @xcite leading to a spurt in the activities of modeling real world complex systems and behavior , for example , multimodal transportation networks @xcite , climatic systems @xcite , the human brain @xcite and failure and robustness @xcite .",
    "it has recently been realized that neglecting the multilayer structure leads to wrong identification of the most versatile nodes , overestimating the importance of more marginal agents @xcite .    in this study , we use a huge empirical social data drawn from the largest film industry in the world , bollywood .",
    "this film industry has gained worldwide coverage by selling an estimated 3.6 billion tickets as compared to hollywood s 2.6 billion as per cbfc 2006 statistics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is said to reflect or affect the decisions and preferences of the populace @xcite .",
    "on one hand , bollywood is driven by the underlying practices prevalent in the society , while on the other hand strongly influences the mass , thus acting as a mirror of the society @xcite .",
    "moreover , network studies on bollywood data have demonstrated how changes in interactions of the underlying networks are associated with events occurring in the society @xcite .",
    "based on all the above , this film industry can be referred to as a model to understand and predict various aspects of society based on complex interaction patterns among the members .",
    "we construct the bollywood networks as follows : the nodes are the actors and interactions between a pair of actors is defined if they have co - acted in a movie .",
    "we assort the co - actor data comprising of movies and their corresponding actors . owing to the rapidly changing nature of the society @xcite",
    ", we divide the data into intervals of five years .",
    "this time frame on one hand is small enough to capture the minute changes shaping in the society and on the other hand is large enough so as to not miss out any prolific change occurring in the society .",
    "we take three such datasets in order to see how the properties of the networks change with time .",
    "considering genres as layers , we construct multilayer networks for each time span .",
    "our analysis using multilayer network approach , on one hand , reveals the importance of versatility of the nodes for their success , while on the other hand indicates the significance of interactions between all types of nodes in the model system .",
    "emergence of cooperation with time is also revealed through our investigations .",
    "* curation of data and network construction : * we collect the bollywood data from a reputed movie repository website @xcite .",
    "we extract the names of all the movies , their sequential star cast list and genre information from 1998 to 2012 and segregate them into three datasets , each consisting of data for five years .",
    "we curate the movies and their details under 33 different genres .",
    "many of the genres had very few movies and considering them separately would have yielded statistically insignificant results .",
    "thus , we combine the genres having very few movies and categorize them as ` others ' .",
    "this gives us eight broad genres namely ` action ' , ` comedy ' , ` drama ' , ` romance ' , ` thriller ' , ` crime and horror ' , ` social ' and ` others ' .",
    "we treat each genre as a layer of the multilayer social network . for a particular layer ,",
    "a pair of actors @xmath6 and @xmath7 are connected if they have co - acted in a movie of the corresponding genre in the respective dataset .",
    "thus , we obtain eight different sub - networks for each multilayer network corresponding the three datasets . for each layer @xmath8 , the elements of the adjacency matrix ,",
    "@xmath9 is given as @xmath10 all the adjacency matrices are symmetric ( i.e. @xmath11 = @xmath12 ) .",
    "the degree of an actor @xmath13 is the number of actors that actor has worked with , given as @xmath13 = @xmath14 .",
    "note that not every actor has worked in movies of every genre .",
    "thus the number of nodes may differ across the genres .",
    "the lead male actors can be defined as the actors occupying the first position in the movie star cast providing an easy way of segregating lead actors and supporting actors .",
    "however , it may be possible that supporting actors have acted as lead actors in few movies appearing in the first position of the star cast @xcite .",
    "further , it is also possible that some actors have acted in only one or two movies , but in lead roles occupying the first position in star cast . in order to avoid such cases , we require a threshold for finding lead actors , which is a common practice used for construction of networks from real data , for instance in construction of gene coexpression networks @xcite .",
    "note that a very low value of threshold may bring in lot of the supporting actors in the list of lead actors , whereas a very high value of threshold may leave behind many known lead actors @xcite . after conducting several trials with different threshold values , we find five movies to be the optimal criteria for all the three datasets .",
    "this broadly divides the actors into two types , one consisting of the lead male actors ( denoted by l ) and the other comprising of the rest of the actors , which includes both supporting actors and female actors ( denoted by s ) .",
    "* filmfare data assimilation : * of the different awards categories introduced over the years of cinematic heritage in bollywood , the filmfare awards , voted by the public and a committee of experts is one of the oldest and the most reputed one @xcite .",
    "we extract the filmfare award nominations data from the website chronologically @xcite and count the number of times every actor is nominated in each five - year span . instead of the awards bagged we rather take into account the award nominations in order to avoid the interplay of some kind of bias affecting the decision .    * dimers and triangles in one or more layers : * if a dimer , a pair of interacting nodes , is present in only one of the eight layers , it is defined as a dimer unique to one layer .",
    "we such dimers are called dimers unique to one layer . if a dimer is present in only any two of the layers , we call it a dimer unique to two layers .",
    "similarly , dimers unique to higher layers are defined .",
    "further , if a triangle , a complete subgraph of order three , is present in only one of the eight layers , it is defined as a triangle unique to one layer . if a triangle is present in only any two of the layers , we call it a triangle unique to two layers . in a similar manner , triangles unique to higher layers are defined .",
    "note that every lead actor appearing in unique ll and ls dimers or lll , lls , lss and sss triangles is counted only once , even if the lead actor has appeared in more than one unique ll , ls dimer or or lll , lls , lss and sss triangle .    * structural measures : * we quantify the degree - degree correlations of a network by considering the pearson ( degree - degree ) correlation coefficient , given as @xcite @xmath15 - [ n_{c}^{-1}\\sum_{l=1}^{n_{c } } \\frac{1}{2}({d_{i}}^{l } + { d_{j}}^{l})^{2 } ] } { [ n_{c}^{-1}\\sum_{l=1}^{n_{c } } \\frac{1}{2}({d_{i}^{l}}^{2}+ { d_{j}^{l}}^{2 } ) ] - [ n_{c}^{-1}\\sum_{l=1}^{n_{c}}\\frac{1}{2}({d_{i}}^{l } + { d_{j}}^{l})^{2}]},\\ ] ] where @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the degrees of nodes at both the ends of the @xmath18 connection and @xmath19 represents the total connections in the network .    in order to investigate the hypothesis of weak ties on networks @xcite , we calculate the link betweenness centrality and overlap as follows .",
    "link betweenness centrality for an undirected link @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the number of shortest paths between @xmath23 and @xmath24 that contain @xmath20 , and @xmath25 is the total number of shortest paths between @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the overlap of the neighborhood of two connected nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 is defined as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the number of neighbors common to both nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 represent the degree of the @xmath30 and @xmath31 nodes .",
    "* structural properties of individual layers : * the degree distribution of many of the layers follow power law , evaluated using maximum likelihood estimation @xcite ( values of parameters provided in table s1 of @xcite ) .",
    "rest of them resemble power law behavior , but the maximum likelihood method rejects the power law hypothesis .",
    "further , we find that there is drastic increase in the size of the networks with time .",
    "in fact from 98 - 02 to 08 - 12 , the size of the network becomes almost double ( table  [ all ] ) .",
    "however , despite a drastic increase in size , the average connectivity of the nodes ( actors ) remain almost same across the three time spans ( table  [ all ] ) indicating the average connectivity as an intrinsic property of the model system .",
    "further , the average clustering coefficient ( @xmath32 ) , which measures the average connectivity of the neighbors @xcite , depict much higher values for all the three datasets ( table  [ properties_multilayer ] ) as compared those of the corresponding random networks ( table s2 of @xcite ) , which is quite expected as various complex social and biological networks are known to exhibit high average clustering coefficient @xcite .",
    ".the properties of all the three bollywood datasets .",
    "here @xmath33 , @xmath19 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 represent the size , number of connections , average degree and overall assortativity coefficient value of the network , respectively . [",
