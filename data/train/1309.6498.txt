    "we collect the basic formulas describing the thomas - fermi ( tf ) ion .    in section 2",
    "we express the thomas - fermi differential equation ( tf de ) with the roles of @xmath9 and @xmath23 interchanged : the radius @xmath9 is the dependent variable , the screening number @xmath23 is the independent variable .",
    "we solve the new de in a semi - analytical manner for @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the initial slope of the screening function @xmath26",

    "we derive new series for @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath27 , with faster convergence .    in section 6",
    "we sum up and plot the results .",
    "the following basic equations of the thomas - fermi atom or ion can be found in most textbooks on classical quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "let s start the description of the tf ion with some potential @xmath28 , with the constraints @xmath29 outside the ion radius x , @xmath28 is a coulomb potential .",
    "@xmath1 is the ionization potential . from electrostatics",
    ", we have @xmath30    the @xmath10:@xmath11 number density is given by poisson s equation : @xmath31 with @xmath32 for @xmath33 .    by inserting this equation into @xmath34 and integrating we obtain the @xmath10:@xmath11-ratio inside radius @xmath9 @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath33 .",
    "the equations given thus far allow us to construct physically reasonable state functions @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , given the overall @xmath10:@xmath11-ratio @xmath3 and the ion radius @xmath0 .",
    "we can then proceed to calculate the binding energy _ per proton _",
    "@xmath41    the actual state of the ion is the one with the highest binding energy @xmath2 .",
    "to find this state , we vary the binding energy : @xmath42 while keeping the overall @xmath10:@xmath11 ratio constant : @xmath43 apparently , the maximal binding energy is achieved when the fermi - surface is flat : @xmath44 the constant @xmath45 on the rhs still depends on our choice of the ion radius @xmath0 .",
    "however , it is intuitively clear that the ion radius is not a free parameter , but is determined by @xmath3 .",
    "we therefore vary @xmath0 in the next step until the binding energy becomes minimal with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "this will be achieved when the eletron density continuously approaches 0 as @xmath9 approaches @xmath0 , i. e. we will have @xmath46 in this way we obtain the relation @xmath47    incidentally , the last four unnumbered equations contain an important relation between the binding energy @xmath6 and the ionization potential @xmath5 : @xmath48 if we drop the restriction @xmath49 , the physical interpretation is straightforward : addition of an electron ( @xmath50 ) to an ion with a level fermi surface increases the binding energy @xmath51 by the ionization potential @xmath1 !",
    "it follows that the binding energy ( now again per proton ) is the primitive of the ionization potential with respect to the @xmath10:@xmath11-ratio : @xmath52      for mathematical convenience , we now describe the potential with the screening number @xmath23 , according to @xmath53 the earlier statements about @xmath28 translate to @xmath54    the fraction of electrons inside radius _ x _ is now @xmath55    here we have introduced the slope of the screening function @xmath56 the initial slope is customarily designated by @xmath25 , and the final slope equals the ionization potential @xmath1 ( see eqn ):",
    "poisson s equation for the electron density is now @xmath58    the binding energy becomes ( after a short calculation , see appendix a ) @xmath59 according to eqn the maximum binding energy @xmath2 is obtained for @xmath60    inserting this density in poisson s equation , we obtain the thomas - fermi differential equation ( tf de ) : @xmath61    the solution of the tf de will maximise the binding energy to @xmath62 in appendix a it is shown that the last integral is @xmath63 .",
    "thus the binding energy finally becomes @xmath64      in deriving the tf de , we have come across three interesting relations between the initial slope of the screening function @xmath25 , the ionization potential = final slope of the screening function @xmath1 , the ion radius @xmath0 , the overall @xmath10:@xmath11-ratio @xmath3 and the binding energy @xmath2 :    * eqn .",

    "the following general solution of the thomas - fermi differential equation is a taylor - series in the parameter @xmath25 ( initial slope of the screening function ) .",
    "the coefficient - functions are calculated numerically .",
    "the second order tf de can be split into two first order differential equations :    @xmath74    @xmath75    this system of de s is non - linear . historically , riemann solved the non - linear de for the plane sound wave by exchanging the roles of the dependent variable _",
    "( pressure ) and the independent variable _ x _ ( position ) @xcite .",
    "we will use the same device here : @xmath23 becomes our independent variable , and _ x _ and all other functions of interest become dependent variables .",
    "the two equations then must be written in the form    @xmath76    @xmath77    let us formally integrate these equations , starting at @xmath78 :    @xmath79    @xmath80    the form of eqn.s and suggests that the functions @xmath81 and @xmath82 can be calculated iteratively : the output of one equation is the input to the other .",
    "the two integral equations can be brought into a more symmetric form by substituting    @xmath83    @xmath84    @xmath85    @xmath86    the result is    @xmath87    @xmath88      the coupled integral eqn.s and contain the parameter @xmath90 .",

    "we therefore set @xmath98    the integral eqn.s and also contain the powers @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",

    "it is striking that the @xmath119 get small very quickly with increasing @xmath121 . on the other hand",
