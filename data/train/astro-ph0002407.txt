    "the abundances of light elements ( cno , na and mg ) in metal - poor stars provide basic constraints for models of the chemical evolution of our galaxy .",
    "these elements are produced by different mechanisms in various astronomical sites .",
    "the ejecta of core collapse sne are expected to be very rich in o , while they are expected to contribute only a fraction of the present c content of the interstellar medium ( ism ) ( see e.g. woosley & weaver 1986 , 1995 ; timmes et al .",
    "1995 ; thielemann et al 1990 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "mixing and/or severe mass loss may bring to the surface large amounts of freshly synthesized c from the outer and cooler regions of he - burning shells ; this c may then be returned to the ism by stellar winds ( iben & renzini 1983 and references therein ) . since these are not fully understood mechanisms , and they may be active in stars of very different masses ( and hence lifetimes ) , the run of the [ c / fe ] ratio with time or overall metal abundance [ fe / h ] is the logarithmic ratio of the abundances of elements a and h in the star , minus the same quantity in the sun . ] is presently not well constrained by stellar and galactic evolution models .",
    "much more insight can be gained from observations .",
    "even more intriguing is the case for n , since this element is not directly produced in large amounts by hydrostatic he - burning ; n synthesis requires recycling of material from a region where h - burning occurs through the cno cycle . in the case of massive stars , n synthesis is then expected to be a secondary process ( see e.g. woosley and weaver 1995 ) , although under certain circumstances even a primary behaviour could be obtained ( timmes et al .",
    "observational data indicate that large amounts of n are present in the outer layers of evolved stars over a wide mass range .",
    "from there , n can be lost to the ism through quiescent or violent stellar winds , as e.g. in the case of planetary nebulae .",
    "this n might result from the processing of either the original c ( leading to a secondary - like behaviour ) , or of freshly synthesized @xmath9c as a consequence of cn - cycle hydrogen - burning at the base of the outer convective envelope which penetrates inward in regions where he - burning previously occurred during the interpulse phases in thermally pulsing intermediate mass stars ( hot bottomed convective envelopes : truran & cameron 1971 ; pagel & edmunds 1981 ) . in this case n - synthesis",
    "has a primary - like behaviour .",
    "lack of an adequate knowledge of the relevant mechanisms prevents accurate predictions of the run of the [ n / fe ] ratio with metal abundance .",
    "the production of mg ( and other @xmath11-elements like si , s , ca , and ti ) closely mimics the production of o , replacing hydrostatic he - burning with hydrostatic burning of c ( or o , etc . ) .",
    "core collapse sn explosions of massive stars are expected to return to the ism large amounts of mg ( thielemann et al .",
    "1990 ; tsujimoto et al . 1995 ; woosley & weaver 1995 ) .",
    "finally , na production during c - burning in massive stars is primary , it is a rather strong function of the neutron density ( truran & arnett 1971 ; woosley & weaver 1995 ) ; since this is expected to be a function of initial stellar metallicity , the [ na / mg ] ratio is predicted to fall below solar in metal - poor stars ( arnett 1973 ; truran 1973 ; woosley & weaver 1995 ) .",
    "it should however be noted that na synthesis by p - capture on @xmath12ne in regions of h - burning shell where o is converted into n has been claimed to explain the na excesses observed in supergiants and in bright giants in globular clusters ( denisenkov & denisenkova 1990 ) ; woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) predicts that some 10% of the @xmath13na synthesized in massive stars is produced in the h - envelope as consequence of the ne - na cycle .",
    "the effects of this reaction during the rgb phase of small mass stars have been studied in detail by langer et al .",
    "these authors found that also a @xmath14ne-@xmath13na cycle might perhaps occur in these stars ; given the large abundances of this last ne isotope , this reaction might well explain observed na excesses .",
    "it is now clear that the na - o anticorrelation is confined to the large density environments of globular clusters ( see e.g. gratton et al .",
    "however no study of the impact of the possible production of na in small mass stars on galactic chemical evolution is available .",
    "observational evidences concerning these elements are discussed in a number of reviews ( see e.g. wheeler et al .",
    "1989 ) . in the following ,",
    "we will only recall the most important points and give some updates .",
    "the situation for c and n is rather confusing due to difficulties in observing the few good abundance indices in metal - poor stars , and to the occurrence of mixing in evolved stars .",
    "a variety of spectral indices can be considered for c and n : however , most of them can not be used over a wide range of metal abundances .",
    "this is the case of c@xmath15  and cn lines , whose strengths depend approximately quadratically on metal abundance ( neglecting the variation of the gaseous pressure with metallicity ) : their observation is limited to evolved and/or metal rich stars . several permitted lines of both c and n are observable in the optical and near - ir ; however , they are of high excitation and the possible presence of departures from lte should be carefully considered for the strongest features ( see e.g. tomkin et al .",
    "the forbidden [ ci ] line at 8727    ( a high quality abundance indicator in the sun ) is vanishingly weak in metal - poor stars .",
    "good data are provided by ch ; unluckily , the best bands of nh are in the near uv , in a quite difficult spectral region .",
    "furthermore , basic data about dissociation and pre - dissociation are not accurately determined for these molecules ( see lambert 1978 ) , causing offsets to be present among various abundance determinations . with these caveats in mind , it is not surprising that there are rather large uncertainties in presently determined trends with metal abundance : current data suggests that the abundances of both c ( peterson & sneden 1978 ; clegg et al .",
    "1981 ; laird 1985 ) and n ( clegg et al . 1981 ; tomkin & lambert 1984 ; laird 1985 ; carbon et al .",
    "1987 ) scale as the fe one , with a possible upward trend for c in the most metal - poor stars ( tomkin et al .",
    "1986 ; carbon et al . 1987 ; tomkin et al .",
    "the presence of a moderate trend for decreasing [ c / fe ] ratios with increasing [ fe / h ] amongst disk stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath16 ) has been recently proposed by andersson and edvardsson ( 1994 ) and tomkin et al .",
    "( 1995 ) from observations of forbidden and permitted c lines respectively .",
    "the run of o abundances with overall metallicity has been the topic of a rather large number of papers in the recent past . a nearly constant [ o / fe ] ratio at [ o / fe]@xmath17  has been indicated by studies of the forbidden line at 6300    in metal - poor giants ( gratton & ortolani 1986 ; barbuy 1988 ; barbuy & erdelyi - mendes 1989 ; sneden et al . 1991a ; kraft et al .",
    "a nearly constant offset of the abundances of o could be interpreted as the result of the contribution by type  ii sne alone to the early galactic nucleosynthesis ( see e.g. matteucci & greggio 1986 ) .",
    "larger o excesses have been obtained from the analysis of the near ir permitted lines in metal - poor dwarfs ( sneden et al .",
    "1979 ) , with an even larger value ( [ o / fe]@xmath18 ) obtained by abia & rebolo ( 1989 ) .",
    "this last analysis does not indicate any plateau in the run of [ o / fe ] with [ fe / h ] , suggesting that only the ejecta of the most massive among type  ii sne polluted the medium from which early stars formed , and requiring then a very fast raise of the metal abundance .",
    "additional important results have been obtained exploiting oh lines at the uv edge of ground - based and in the near ir spectra of subdwarfs ; note that use of oh bands is very promising , since these are detectable also in extremely metal - poor stars , where the other diagnostics are vanishingly weak .",
    "early results ( bessell et al . 1991 ; balachandran & carney 1996 ) seemed to confirm those obtained from forbiden lines .",
    "however , more extensive analysis ( nissen et al . 1994 ; israelian et al .",
    "1998 ; boesgaard et al .",
    "1999 ) are in better agreement with results from the permitted lines . if these large o abundances held for globular clusters too , the deduced ages would be substantially reduced .",
    "an examination of these o abundance analyses reveals several weak points .",
    "( i ) a na - o anticorrelation exists amongst the brightest globular cluster giants ( see kraft 1994 and references therein ) , although its explanation is still not clear . in a very recent analysis of mixing episodes amongst field stars ( gratton et al .",
    "1999b ) , we find that deep mixing ( affecting c and n abundances ) indeed occurs at luminosities brighter than the rgb bump , when the molecular weight barrier is canceled by the outward expansion of the h - burning shell .",
    "however , o ( and na ) abundances are unaltered in field stars , in good agreement with predictions of theoretical models ( sweigart & mengel 1979 ; charbonnel 1994 ) , and previous observational indications ( kraft et al .",
    "1982 , shetrone 1996 , pilachowski et al .",
    "1996 , kraft et al .",
    "hence the na - o anticorrelation seems to be limited to the dense environments of globular clusters , and not relevant for the discussion of field stars .",
    "( ii ) o abundances are sensitive to the adopted atmospheric parameters .",
    "( iii ) permitted ir lines likely form in non - lte conditions when lines are rather strong ( baschek et al .",
    "1977 ) , while no departure from lte is expected for the forbidden line at 6300.3   .",
    "a very critical test would thus be the analysis of forbidden lines in very metal - poor dwarfs ; unfortunately , this test can be done only for a few cool , not very metal - poor dwarfs and subgiants : results ( spiesmann & wallerstein 1991 ; spite & spite 1991 ; balachandran & carney 1996 ; fulbright & kraft 1999 ) support the abundances obtained for giants .",
    "( iv ) the uv",
    "oh bands used by israelian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and boesgaard et al .",
    "( 1999 ) are in a very crowded region in the extreme ground - based uv , and oscillator strengths for these bands are not well determined : hence , results from oh can not be still considered as conclusive ( see also balachandran & bell 1997 ) .    the problem of o abundances in metal - poor stars has been addressed in a series of papers by king ( 1993 , 1994 ) .",
    "he showed that while departures from lte likely play only a minor rle ( a result also suggested by the statistical equilibrium computations by kiselman 1991 , 1993 ) , abundances from permitted and forbidden lines both yield the same [ o / fe ] ratio ( [ o / fe]@xmath19 , with only a shallow trend with overall metal abundance ) if a new set of effective temperatures is adopted for subdwarfs and only high quality equivalent widths ( @xmath20s ) are used .",
    "unfortunately , the temperature scale for subdwarfs is still not well settled : temperatures derived by at least one recent paper ( nissen et al .",
    "1994 ) are much lower than those adopted by king ( 1993 ) ; adoption of these low temperatures would regenerate the very high o abundances found in older analyses of subdwarfs ( see cavallo et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "abundances for na and mg in metal - poor stars have been determined by a number of authors ( franois 1986a , 1986b ; magain 1987 ; gratton & sneden 1987 , 1988 ) .",
    "however fine details , like the possible existence of a gradient of [ mg / fe ] with [ fe / h ] among stars with [ fe / h]@xmath21 , or the precise form of the run of the [ na / mg ] ratio with [ fe / h ] , were still not defined in these older papers at the level required for a detailed comparison with the predictions by models of the chemical evolution of the galaxy ( se e.g. matteucci and franois 1992 ) . in part , this is due to the rather large uncertainties present in the atmospheric parameters used by these otherwise careful discussions . for mg , the situation has now changed thanks to the excellent papers by fuhrmann et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , fuhrmann ( 1998 ) , and nissen and schuster ( 1997 ) : these papers showed that ( i ) mg is uniformly overabundant in most halo and all thick disk stars , although there are a few halo stars having lower mg excesses ; and ( ii ) the fe abundance increase at constant mg at the transition between thick and thin disk .",
    "this last result agrees with our earlier finding for o ( gratton et al .",
    "1996b ) , and will be discussed more in detail in paper iv .",
    "the aim of the present series of papers is to contribute to the knowledge about the abundances of fe , c , n , o , na and mg in metal - poor stars . in the course of this investigations , various critical points in the analysis were examined : some of them are discussed here , while others ( the solar abundances and the applicability of kurucz model atmospheres in abundance analyses ) were considered in a parallel study of the spectra of rr lyrae at minimum light ( clementini et al .",
    "1995 ) and in a rather extensive comparison with solar observations ( castelli et al .",
    "1997 ) , in gratton et al .",
    "( 1996a : paper i ) ( the  scale and the adopted atmospheric parameters ) , and in gratton et al .",
    "( 1999a : paper ii ) ( non - lte effects ) .",
    "in this paper we present the abundance analysis and its results .",
    "detailed comparisons with nucleosynthesis predictions and models of galactic chemical evolution models will be done in forthcoming papers ( gratton et al . 2000 : paper iv ; carretta & gratton 2000 : paper v ) . the observational material is described in section  2 , where we show its high degree of internal consistency , with the @xmath20s generally accurate to within @xmath22  m .",
    "the abundance indicators used in the analysis , with the basic atomic and molecular data adopted , are described in section  3 .",
    "our final abundances are presented in section  4 ; for o , mg and na they include non - lte corrections determined in paper ii .",
    "we found that our results have a high internal consistency , at least for @xmath23  k , with error bars in most cases below 0.1 dex .",
    "in particular , we obtain good agreement between abundances provided by low excitation , forbidden and high excitation , permitted o  i lines ; between c abundances deduced from c@xmath15 , ch , permitted and forbidden c  i lines ; and between na abundances provided by the d and subordinate lines .",
    "some problem still exists for mg .",
    "we compare our results with those from some recent paper in section 5 ; finally conclusions are given in section  6 .",
    "finally , note that the material on which the present analysis is based on does not include the data discussed in gratton et al .",
    "( 1999b ) .",
    "the observational material is described in paper i ; here we recall that the original data concerning 19 metal - poor stars were complemented by literature data in order to better examine trends of abundances with [ fe / h ] and luminosity .",

    "lines are strongly sensitive to temperature in the deepest part of the atmospheres , and hence on how convection is handled when computing models . finally , the abundance ratios are sensitive to the adopted values for the microturbulent velocities because thermal motions are larger than microturbulent velocities for these light species .",
    "the smaller overall sensitivity to uncertainties in the atmospheric parameters and model atmospheres of o and c abundances deduced from [ oi ] and ch lines support their use as primary abundance indicators .",

    "analyses based on forbidden lines in metal - poor giants and on the ir triplets in subdwarfs probably introduce significant biases ( see also gratton 1990 ; 1993 ) .",
    "carbon abundances for the stars in our original data set were derived from a comparison of observed and synthetic spectra of the wavelength region 42074225   , which includes several features due to the r branch of the @xmath39  ( @xmath40 ) transition of ch . for a few , generally metal - rich stars ,",

    "both these sets of abundance indices were considered by lambert ( 1978 ) in his analysis of the solar carbon abundance : lambert derived values of log  n(c)=8.67 and 8.73 from the ch @xmath41  and the c@xmath15  swan bands respectively . while lambert observed that the ch @xmath41  band can not be considered the best abundance indicator in the sun ( due to concern in the correct location of the continuum level at these short wavelengths ) , it is the best choice in metal - poor stars , as shown by sneden et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and tlls .",
    "in particular , tlls showed that a systematic error is possibly present in their c abundances obtained from c  i lines around 9100   : the derived abundances show a residual trend with t@xmath42 that vanishes when the c abundance is instead obtained from ch ( see their fig . 8) .",
    "the dissociation potential for ch has been determined with high accuracy at @xmath43  ev ( brzozowski et al .",
    "unfortunately , situation is not so good for the band oscillator strengths ( see discussions in grevesse & sauval 1973 and chmielewski 1984 )",
    ". furthermore , predissociation greatly affects the strength of transitions with rotational quantum numbers @xmath44  larger than @xmath45  for the ( 0,0 ) band , @xmath46 for the ( 1,1 ) band , and with any value of @xmath44  for the ( 2,2 ) band .",
    "hence , we prefer to use the band oscillator strengths deduced by chmielewski ( 1984 ) from an analysis of the solar spectrum .",
    "the lines considered by chmielewski have rotational quantum numbers similar to those considered here ( actually the set of lines used in his study overlaps with our ) , and therefore use of his recommended values is appropriate here .",

    "three groups of features were considered : permitted high excitation lines close to 9100 ( clegg et al 1981 ; tlls ) and 7100    ( tomkin et al 1995 ) , and the forbidden line at 8727    ( andersson and edvardsson 1994 ) .",
    "features of the first group are stronger , and can be observed in very metal poor stars , while the others are weak and can only be observed in disk stars . in the analysis of these lines we used line data from the original papers : it should be noticed that the solar abundances obtained with the permitted lines near 7100  (log  n(c)=8.66 ) and the forbidden line ( log  n(c)=8.67 ) agree very well with the recommended solar abundance of log  n(c)=8.60 ( grevesse et al 1991 ) .    while the effects of departures from lte are certainly negligible for the weak [ ci ] line , they might be more significant for the high excitation permitted line . statistical equilibrium calculations for the c features considered in this paper have been carried out by strenburg & holweger ( 1990 ) and tomkin et al ( 1992 , 1995 ) .",
    "these calculations indicate that non - lte abundance corrections are small ( @xmath47  dex ) for the lines near 7100    ( hence we simply adopted the lte values ) . however , they may be not negligible for the stronger lines near 9100   , depending on the adopted cross sections for collisions with hi atoms ( tlls ) . to take into account these non - lte effects",
    ", we corrected the average c abundances from the reanalysis of tlls @xmath20s by the same amount they did .",
    "we obtained nitrogen abundances using a number of cn features due to the @xmath48  bands of the violet system ( @xmath49 ) near the bandhead at 4215    , and the 2,0 vibrational band of the red system ( @xmath50 ) in the wavelength range 7910 - 7982    .",
    "unluckily , no observation were available for the nh bands .",
    "the dissociation potential of cn is not well determined ( see e.g. the discussions in lambert 1978 , and lambert & ries 1981 ) , with values ranging from 7.5 to 7.9  ev : this is still the major source of uncertainty in the derived abundances of n from cn .",
    "in fact , the above mentioned range translates in a factor of about 3 in the derived n abundances . here",
    "we will assume a value of @xmath51  ev ( engleman & rouse 1975 ) .",

    "band strengths of the red system are discussed in sneden & lambert ( 1982 ) , who also compared theoretical values with those derived from analysis of the solar spectrum .",
    "here we adopted their solar oscillator strengths for the ( 2,0 ) band , and verified that they well reproduce the kpno solar flux spectrum .",
    "the 12c13 ratio was determined by a spectral synthesis of three @xmath10ch features at 4211.46 , 4213.13 , and 4221.83   , since most of the higher quality @xmath10ch indicators listed by sneden et al .",

    "comparison of synthesized spectra with the solar one gives a good match for the canonical solar 12c13 ratio of 89 ; however , this comparison is not so meaningful here , due to the large solar 12c13 ratio .",
    "we may however compare the present 12c13 ratios with those determined by sneden et al for 3 giants in common between the two samples : on average , our 12c13 ratios are larger by @xmath53% ( @xmath5425% ) .",
    "we attribute this difference to our use of not first class indicators ; however , we will adopt our 12c13 ratios with no further correction .",
    "na abundances for stars in the original sample mainly rest on the @xmath20s for the yellow doublet at 5682 and 5688   , for which we performed a full non - lte analysis ( see paper ii for details ) .",

    "however , synthetic spectra for both the sun and the program stars show that this contamination does not affect significatively the abundance derivation : the mean difference between abundances extracted from the 5682 and the ( clean ) 5688     line is only @xmath55  dex ( @xmath56  dex ) . in table",

    "1988 ) ; there has been however some confusion in the astronomical literature about its @xmath38 : e.g. zhao & magain ( private communication ) used a value of @xmath60 , which yields a discrepant value for the solar mg abundance .",
    "however , the @xmath61value for this line of @xmath62 has been determined from accurate lifetime measurements ( kwong et al 1982 ) : a solar analysis with this value of the @xmath38 , an @xmath20  of 101  m  ( steffen 1985 ) and the k92 solar atmosphere yielded a value of the abundance of mg of log  n(mg)=7.65 , in good agreement with that obtained from the other lines in our list ( log  n(mg)=@xmath63 ) and with the meteoritic mg abundance of log  n(mg)=@xmath64 ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) .",

    "however the red triplet is so close that it is not well resolved even on our rather high resolution spectra ; and the 4730.038    line is blended with a cr   i line at 4729.859   , so that accurate @xmath57 are not easily derived for these features .",
    "we then adopted the abundances given by comparison with synthetic spectra .",

    "( 1999b ) ; however , since these models became available to us only after all computations for the present paper were completed , and since abundances relative to the sun obtained with the two sets of models agree very well each other for stars warmer than = 4600  k , we decided not to repeat these lengthy computations and simply eliminated stars cooler than this limit from further discussion .",
    "once this was done , the mean residual between o abundances provided by permitted and forbidden lines is @xmath68  dex ( 32 stars ; @xmath69  dex ) ; both mean difference and scatter are very small .",
    "note that in our analysis we assumed a solar o abundance of log  n(o)=8.93 , the value recommended by anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) from an analysis of the forbidden lines and oh bands .",
    "however , a study of permitted lines in the sun ( bimont et al . 1991 ) gives a solar o abundance of log   n(o)=8.86 ; the difference with the abundance from forbidden lines found in the sun is then almost the same we found in field stars .",
    "of course , this result depends on the adopted non - lte corrections , which stem from our own statistical equilibrium calculations .",
    "however , we found that these corrections are small : on average , abundances derived from ir permitted lines must be lowered by 0.06  dex , the largest correction ( @xmath70   dex ) being obtained for the warmest stars .",
    "explorative computations with @xmath71=0.03 and @xmath71=3 ( the extreme values of the multiplicative factor @xmath71  for h  i collisions compatible with observations of rr lyrae ; see paper ii for the definition of @xmath71 ) show that the non - lte corrections are uncertain by about @xmath72  dex for these stars .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] shows the run of the [ o / fe ] ratio with t@xmath42 for stars with [ fe / h]@xmath73 , both from permitted and forbidden lines .",
    "systematic trends in abundances derived from both indicators are clearly present .",
    "these trends can not be attributed to an evolutionary effect for two reasons :    1 .   permitted and forbidden",
    "lines exhibit opposite trends 2 .",
    "three of the stars in the skpl sample are likely to be in evolutionary phases later than the rgb , according to their position in the @xmath74  diagram of twarog & anthony - twarog ( 1994 ) : two of them are probably horizontal branch stars ( bd+11@xmath752998 : [ o / fe]=+0.30 ; and hd  166161 : [ o / fe]=+0.40 ) , while the third one is likely to be at the base of the asymptotic giant branch ( hd  204543 : [ o / fe]=+0.36 ) .",
    "their [ o / fe ] ratios are much larger than those measured in several cooler stars , and actually do not differ significantly from the average obtained for warm stars .",
    "departures from lte are not expected for the forbidden lines .",
    "hence , the most likely explanation for the trend with @xmath76  is large deviations of the atmospheric structure from that of k92 models used in this paper , that seem to be not fully adequate to reproduce the coolest stars . this last possibility is also supported by the poor equilibrium of ionization we get for fe ( paper i ) .",
    "carbon abundances provided by ch and c@xmath15  lines for our original star list are listed in columns  3 and 4 of table  [ tab:3 ] respectively .",

    "scatter is 0.05  dex ) .",
    "this systematic difference is small , although it seems to be significant .",
    "however , the large differences between the c abundances obtained using c@xmath15  lines when different solar model atmospheres are considered ( see table  [ tab:1 ] ) might suggest that the structure of the model atmospheres plays an important rle here . luckily , [ c / fe ] ratios deduced from ch lines are much less sensitive on the adopted model atmospheres :",

    "the mean difference is very small , but there might be a small trend for increasing differences with decreasing .",
    "a larger sample is required to explore this issue .    before discussing the run of c abundances with overall metallicity , stars which have undergone mixing episodes",
    "must be eliminated , since c is expected to be depleted in luminous giants ( see figure  [ fig:5 ] , where we used different symbols for stars in different bins of metal abundances ) .",
    "however , the precise location of the first dredge up can not be determined from these data alone , due the lack of stars of intermediate luminosities ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "this issue is considered in detail in another analysis ( gratton et al .",
    "1999b ) . in figure  [ fig:6 ]",
    "we have plotted [ c / fe ] ratios determined from the g - band in the present work and from a compilation of literature studies . while the scatter of these [ c / fe ] ratios is large ( data include c abundances determined from low dispersion spectra as well as higher quality determinations ) , this figure reveals that the depletion of surface c abundances occurs at a luminosity around @xmath84 , or slightly fainter , in agreement with predictions from evolutionary models ( sneden et al .",
    "1986 ) , and with observations of stars in metal - poor globular clusters ( see e.g. bell et al .",
    "1990 ) , and with the results of gratton et al .",
    "( 1999b ) .",
    "since there is no evidence that any appreciable c depletion has occurred for stars as bright as @xmath85 , in the following we will assume that stars fainter than this limit have the original surface c abundance .",
    "we may now plot in figure  [ fig:7 ] the run of the [ c / fe ] ratio with [ fe / h ] for _ bona fide _ unmixed stars ( i.e. those with @xmath86 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:7 ] shows that the [ c / fe ] ratio is roughly solar over the whole metallicity regime explored in this paper .",
    "the moderate overabundances in the most metal - poor disk stars suggested by andersson and edvardsson ( 1994 ) and tomkin et al ( 1995 ) are reduced to a marginally significant @xmath87  dex value in our reanalysis of their data : this is mainly due to the adoption of a higher  scale .",
    "we finally warn the reader that the [ c / fe ] run of figure  [ fig:7 ] is obtained by combining data provided by the analysis of various features ; while the overall trend seem well defined ( different indices yielding similar results ) , small offsets might still be present . a more comprehensive study",
    "overcoming the selection biases present in all available samples would be welcome .",
    "panels a and b of figure  [ fig:8 ] display the run of the 12c13 ratio against stellar luminosity for stars with @xmath88[fe / h]@xmath89 , and for stars with [ fe / h]@xmath90  respectively .    plotted data include 12c13 ratios determined in this paper , as well as those by sneden et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and shetrone et al .",
    "both panels indicate that the 12c13 ratio declines with increasing luminosity : in fact , stars with @xmath86  have very large values of the 12c13 ratios ( in most cases , only lower limits can be determined ) , while very small values ( 410 ) have been obtained for stars with @xmath91 .",
    "these data confirm earlier findings for both field and cluster stars ( see e.g. gilroy & brown 1991 ; and gratton et al .",
    "1999b ) , and the lack of evidences for mixing in stars with @xmath86 .",
    "n abundances are listed in columns 5 , 6 and 7 of table  [ tab:3 ] ; they were obtained only for stars in our original sample . in some spectra ,",
    "cn features are very weak , and only upper limits can be obtained .",
    "furthermore , there might be a systematic offset in our nitrogen abundances , due both to errors in the c abundances and to uncertainties in the same analysis of cn ( e.g. related to uncertainties in the dissociation potential for this molecule ) .",
    "conclusions are thus not as clean as those obtained for the other elements .",
    "the comparison between abundances provided by lines due to 4 blends of the blue system ( between 4211 and 4216   ) and about 40 blends of the red system ( between 7912 and 7980   ) is rather good .",
    "on average , n abundances given by the blue system are larger by @xmath92  dex ( @xmath93  dex , 8 stars ) .",
    "a large part of this difference is due to a single star ( hd  136316 ) having very weak lines of the red system ; once this star is dropped , the average difference is @xmath94  dex ( @xmath95  dex , 7 stars ) , which may be attributed to small errors in the location of the continuum level in our line crowded , blue spectra . in the following , we simply averaged the n abundances provided by the two systems .",
    "the run of the [ n / fe ] ratio against stellar luminosity is shown in figure  [ fig:9 ] .",
    "there is an obvious trend for increasing n abundances with increasing luminosity which is clearly symmetric with respect to the run of the [ c / fe ] ratio : stars with @xmath96  have [ n / fe]=@xmath97  dex ( @xmath98  dex , 11 stars ) , while more luminous stars have [ n / fe]=@xmath99  dex ( @xmath100  dex , 6 stars ) . as well known , this is exactly what expected if n - rich , c - poor material is brought to the surface from regions of cno - cycle h - burning .",
    "mean [ ( c+n)/fe ] ratios ( table  [ tab:3 ] ) for stars fainter and brighter than @xmath101  are @xmath81  dex ( @xmath102  dex , 13 stars ) and @xmath103  dex ( @xmath93  dex , 6 stars ) respectively .",
    "however , we are not inclined to give much weight to this difference , due to possible systematic errors in abundances deduced from molecular species related to the uncertain values of the dissociation energy . moreover , in our sample , the most luminous stars are also more metal - poor : hence , the systematic trend of the [ ( c+n)/fe ] ratio with luminosity might be due to a trend with metal abundance .",
    "unluckily , our sample can not be used to constrain the run of the [ n / fe ] ratio with metal abundance , since n abundances were obtained only for metal - rich stars or stars in which mixing events have already changed the original abundances .",
    "non - lte corrections for the na lines considered in the present work are rather small ( @xmath104  dex ) both for the sun and for moderately metal - poor dwarfs ( in these last cases they are slightly positive : @xmath105  dex ) . however , since corrections depend on stellar gravity , they are not negligible ( up to 0.3  dex ) for metal - poor giants .",
    "moreover , corrections for these stars depend on the adopted value for the collisional cross - section ( see also paper ii for a detailed discussion ) . in order to quantify this dependence , we repeated our statistical equilibrium computations for a typical metal - poor giant ( hd  122956 ) , using different values for the multiplicative constant @xmath71 for the collisional cross - sections : @xmath1060.001 , 0.01 and 0.1 . as expected , non - lte corrections are negligible for large @xmath71 values , but they are rather large ( about 0.4  dex ) for @xmath71=0.001 .",
    "this last value yields cross sections much smaller than those estimated by kaulakys ( 1985 , 1986 ) , but it is however still compatible with rr lyrae observations ( see also paper ii ) .",

    "; it may be due to uncertainties in the atmospheric parameters , which might induce rather large errors in the [ na / fe ] ratios",

    "barbuy et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and magain ( 1989 ) suggested that large discrepances exist between abundances provided by the resonance intercombination line and higher excitation mg lines in the spectra of red giants and subdwarfs .",
    "magain estimated differences as large as 0.6 dex , apparently a strong function of surface gravity ; he suggested that the dominant non - lte effect for mg should be overionization , and that the resonance line may require larger non - lte corrections since there is a larger contribution in its formation from the outer atmospheric layers than in the case of the higher excitation lines .",
    "however , other studies obtained a much better agreement between abundances provided by different mg lines : in an analysis of the spectra of rr lyrae variables ( clementini et al .",
    "1995 ) , it was found that the mg abundances deduced from the intercombination resonance line at 4571    are larger than those provided by higher excitation lines by @xmath113  dex ; a similar result has been obtained in the present analysis for field , not - variable stars ( in this case the mean difference is @xmath114  dex ) .",
    "this is due both to the different value for the @xmath38  of the intercombination line ( see section  3.6 ) , and to the adoption of a higher -scale ; however , to better clarify this issue we decided to perform detailed statistical equilibrium computations for a mg  i model atom ( see paper ii for details ) .",

    "derived abundances are very similar to those ( not shown here ) obtained under lte assumption : corrections are @xmath116  dex for the observed high excitation lines , that form at large optical depth and are usually very weak .",
    "very small non - lte corrections are found even for the intercombination line ; they are in the range 0.050.10  dex only for cool and moderately metal - poor giants ( hd  136316 and hd  187111 ) . in these stars",
    "this line is very strong and heavily saturated .    in order to check the sensitivity of our statistical equilibrium computations to the value of the parameter @xmath71",

    "as expected , our results show that mg abundances are about 0.05  dex larger for all lines .",
    "we can then conclude that upper limits to non - lte corrections for mg abundances are 0.15  dex for the intercombination line and 0.10  dex for the other lines , in the stars of our program sample .",
    "the low mg abundances obtained by barbuy et al .",

    "the reason of this discrepancy is not completely clear ; we examined different hypoteses , like systematic differences in the oscillator strengths , in @xmath57 and in adopted values of the microturbulent velocity .",
    "our conclusion is that none of these causes can explain the observed difference .",
    "more promising is the possibility that departures from lte ( computed for the zm90 sample with the @xmath71 parameter recommended from the analysis of rr lyrae stars ) could be underestimated .",
    "in fact , corrections derived from the high excitation lines are larger for the warmest and most metal - poor stars , as the stars in the zm90 sample are : while corrections for the intercombination line are larger in the coolest metal - poor stars .    notwithstanding this ( small ) discrepancy ,",

    "o abundances from permitted atomic lines are on average larger than ours by @xmath126  dex ( scatter 0.13  dex ) , a difference that may be attributed to our adopted corrections for departures from lte ( these corrections are not included in the boesgaard et al.s o abundances ) .",
    "while we regard these differences as minor , we note that combining the higher o abundances with the lower [ fe / h ] s , on average the [ o / fe ] values of boesgaard et al .",
    "are higher than ours by 0.18  dex .    since the present analysis reproduces quite well the results by boesgaard et al .",
    ", apart from small offsets in [ fe / h ] and [ o / fe ] that may be easily explained , it seems quite odd that our figure  [ fig:4 ] does not support well their mean relation [ o / fe]=@xmath127  [ fe / h ]  + @xmath128(a similar steep slope was previously obtained by israelian et al .",
    "1998 , still from analysis of oh bands in the extreme ground - based uv ) . rather , our o abundances suggest a mild slope ( @xmath4 ) in the [ o / fe ] ratios for stars with [ fe / h]@xmath21 , with a rather abrupt change in the range @xmath129[fe / h]@xmath130 , and then an almost constant value for higher metallicities ( in paper iv we will interprete such a relation within the framework of galactic evolution ) .",
    "part of this difference may be attributed simply to statistics : we considered a much larger number of stars , mainly in the critical metal abundance range @xmath129[fe / h]@xmath130 , corresponding to the transition from thick to thin disk .",
    "however , we note that the constant slope of the run of average [ o / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] found by boesgaard et al .",
    "is due to their o abundances from oh , and not to those from oi lines . to show this , we plotted in figure  [ fig:12 ] the runs of the [ o / fe ] values with [ fe / h ] obtained by boesgaard et al . with o",
    "abundances from oi lines and from oh .",
    "overimposed is the boesgaard et al .",
    "mean relation : while this provides an excellent fit to the abundances from oh , the slope suggested by oi lines is much milder , and roughly in agreement with the impression given by our figure  [ fig:4 ] .",
    "while the issue of o abundance determinations is clearly not yet definitely settled , we argue that abundances from oh for stars in the metal abundance range @xmath129[fe / h]@xmath130  may be regarded with suspicion , since location of the continuum level is difficult at these wavelengths in such line rich spectra .",
    "we are now publishing a separate paper on mixing episodes along the rgb ( gratton et al .",
    "the two analysis are almost completely independent each other , using different observational material , a different set of atmospheric parameters , different line lists , and even slightly different model atmospheres ( those used here are the kurucz models with the overshooting option switched on ; the paper on mixing uses the model atmospheres with the overshooting option switched off ) .",
    "however , there are 5 stars in common between the two samples ( here we only considered stars in the original samples ) ; they are all giants , with somewhat uncertain reddening estimates . on average",
    "adopted atmospheric parameters are quite similar , although with a quite large star - to - star scatter : present @xmath76 s and gravities are lower by @xmath131  k ( @xmath132  k ) , and @xmath133  dex ( @xmath134  dex ) , respectively .",
    "average abundances are also quite similar : differences ( in the sense this paper - gratton et al .",
    "1999b ) are are @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138  dex for [ fe / h ] , [ c / fe ] ( from ch ) , and [ o / fe ] ( from [ oi ] and oi lines ) , respectively .",
    "scatter for individual stars is however quite large ( 0.21 , 0.15 , 0.17 , and 0.33 dex ) .",
    "these slightly different results are due to the different choice about the atmospheric parameters .",
    "if we would adopt the same parameters for these stars used in gratton et al .",
    "( 1999b ) , we would have obtained average differences of @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142  dex for [ fe / h ] , [ c / fe ] ( from ch ) , and [ o / fe ] ( from [ oi ] and oi lines ) , respectively , with much smaller scatter individual stars ( 0.05 , 0.14 , 0.10 , and 0.03 dex ) . finally , for na we compared the abundances of this paper with those for the extended sample of gratton et al .",
    "( 1999b ) : from 21 stars , we get an average offset of @xmath143  dex ( @xmath98  dex ) .",
    "a further interesting comparison is with the very precise recent analysis of nearby dwarfs and subgiants by fuhrmann ( 1998 ) .",
    "there are 32 stars in common between our paper and that of fuhrmann .",
    "the agreement is very good : on average , our [ fe / h ] are smaller by @xmath144  dex ( @xmath111  dex ) , while the [ mg / fe ] values are larger by @xmath145  dex ( @xmath146  dex ) . in paper iv ,",
    "when we will discuss the implications of the present data for galactic evolution , we will see that the conclusions we reach are very similar to those of fuhrmann .",
    "in this paper we have presented an analysis of the abundances of fe , c , n , o , na , and mg in a large sample ( @xmath147 ) of field stars .",
    "original data consisted in a new set of high resolution , high s / n spectra for 19 stars ; these were complemented with high quality @xmath20s from selected literature surveys .",
    "whenever possible , we tried to compare results obtained with several abundance indices .      1 .   once the ( small ) corrections for non - lte effects ( presented in gratton et al .",
    "1999 : paper ii ) are considered , o abundances derived from the permitted lines are fully consistent with those obtained using the forbidden line at 6300.3    for stars with @xmath04600  k ; this result agrees with that obtained by king ( 1993 ) , but not with other studies using a lower -scale for subdwarfs .",
    "the o overabundance in metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath1 ) are @xmath148  dex ( @xmath149  dex , 11 stars ) and @xmath150  dex ( @xmath110  dex , 33 stars ) from forbidden and permitted lines respectively ; the mean value is @xmath2  dex ( @xmath151 , 32 stars ) . however , the most luminous metal - poor field stars yield slightly smaller o abundances than fainter stars of similar metallicities .",
    "this is attributed to inadequacy of kurucz ( 1992 ) model atmospheres with overshooting for stars cooler than @xmath152  k. our data suggest a general overabundance of o in metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath21 ) , with only a gentle trend for decreasing o excesses with increasing metal abundances ; these results are not well fitted by a constant slope in the relation between [ o / fe ] and [ fe / h ] recently suggested from the analysis of oh lines . 2 .   if only _ bonafide _",
    "unmixed stars are considered , c abundances scale as fe ones over the whole range explored ( [ fe / h]@xmath153 ) .",
    "we did not confirm the moderate c excess found by andersson and edvardsson ( 1994 ) and tomkin et al ( 1995 ) in metal - poor disk stars ( @xmath7[fe / h]@xmath8 ) ; this is due to our adoption of a higher  scale .",
    "na abundances scale as fe ones in the high metallicity regime , while metal - poor stars present a na underabundance .",
    "none of the field stars analyzed here belong to the group of o - poor and na - rich stars observed in globular clusters .",
