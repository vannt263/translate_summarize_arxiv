    "the idea of trapping neutral atoms in periodic light shift potentials made by interfering laser beams has been conceived in the nineteen sixties as a possible means to localize the atoms below an optical wavelength and thus to overcome the notorious limitations of spectroscopy by doppler broadening @xcite .",
    "it was soon realized that even with the highest intensities conceivable with feasible laser technology the depth of the realizable potentials would be constrained to the mk range such that extraordinarily low temperatures would be required , unaccessible with state of the art cooling technology at that time . hence , optical lattices remained science fiction until the concept of laser cooling was developed in the nineteen eighties , suddenly allowing sub - mk temperatures @xcite . in the beginning",
    "nineteen nineties the first optical lattices with laser cooled atoms were prepared @xcite and immediately the regular arrangement of the atoms was made visible with the technique of bragg scattering , well known from x - ray crystallography @xcite .",
    "a new vision was born , namely that such volatile systems of thin gases spatially ordered in a web of light could mimic crystalline solids .",
    "unfortunately , temperatures were still too high to allow light - shift potentials sufficiently shallow to enable significant rates for tunneling between adjacent wells .",
    "this , however , appeared to be the crucial step to proceed from an array of independent microscopic atom traps to an ensemble with some collective character reminiscent of what is found in solids .",
    "further cooling was soon achieved via evaporation @xcite , leading to the formation of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite , which could be readily loaded even into shallow light - shift potentials @xcite .",
    "suddenly , the stage was prepared for the impressive success story of optical lattices that we have seen during the past two decades . today , besides their well established relevance as a quantum laboratory for many - body lattice physics @xcite , also their originally envisioned objective as a tool for precision spectroscopy has become reality in their application in modern atomic clocks @xcite .    an early milestone , pointing out the relevance of optical lattices for quantum many - body physics , has been the insight that optical lattices with bosons in their ground state represent a nearly ideal implementation of the bosonic hubbard model @xcite .",
    "this has led to the demonstration of the superfluid - to - mott - insulator transition , when upon deepening the wells the system switches from the tunneling - dominated regime to the interaction - dominated regime @xcite . despite this intriguing phenomenon of a phase transition triggered by quantum fluctuations ,",
    "a notable limitation of the prospects of optical lattices for emulating more complex lattice models has soon become apparent . for bosonic atoms the ground states possible in optical lattices",
    "are necessarily positive definite , a very general property of bosonic ground state wave functions early discussed by feynman @xcite .",
    "a possible way out of this dilemma is to amend the light shift potentials with artificial gauge fields @xcite , such that hopping processes are endowed with tailor - made phase factors or even more complex unitary transformations .",
    "another obvious avenue , which is the topic of this article , is to utilize orbital degrees of freedom in higher bloch bands .",
    "this strategy , geared by the paradigm of electronic matter , where orbital physics is ubiquitous ( prominent examples are transition metal oxides @xcite ) , brings important new elements to the toolbox of optical lattices .",
    "bosonic wave functions may be composed of high - order orbitals with complex nodal geometries with all the notorious extra freedom due to orientation , hybridization or energy degeneracy .",
    "the latter most importantly can come with the consequence that much lower energy scales than that of tunneling ( for example weak collisional interactions ) can become determinant for the structure of the minimal - energy state , a scenario known from quantum hall physics .",
    "this may result in the emergence of unconventional chiral superfluid order in configuration space , which has a momentum space analogy in the global chiral symmetry of the superfluid order parameter proposed for the cooper pairs of certain electronic superconductors @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this synopsis is to assemble the basic ideas , requirements and observations in our investigation of orbital physics in optical lattices with bosons .",
    "experimental findings , distributed over a number of original articles , are combined with more recent , improved experimental data and extended theoretical interpretation in order to provide a convincing picture of our research results , accessible also for a non - specialist readership .",
    "so far , only a few experimental groups have engaged to explore metastable condensates in higher bands and many possibilities are still ahead .",
    "this brief review aims to stimulate further experimental groups to step in .",
    "a number of theory groups have pioneered our understanding of the physics of bosons condensed in higher bands . in particular , the physics of @xmath2-band bosons in a monopartite square lattice has been extensively studied in seminal work by isacsson and girvin in 2005 @xcite and by liu and wu in 2006 @xcite . in this work",
    "it has been pointed out that complex - valued , time reversal symmetry breaking superfluid order can emerge as a consequence of interactions between degenerate orbitals characterized by an orbital hund s rule . a review of this early work is found in ref . @xcite .",

    "although transfer of a fraction of the atoms into the second band was possible , the subsequent intra - band relaxation dynamics showed only little tendency to restore coherence .",
    "this experiment has taught us that a successful strategy to achieve condensates in higher bands relies on the interplay of a number of basic requirements , summarized in the following considerations .",
    "long - lived condensates can , if at all , only be prepared in the lowest energy states of a band .",
    "these minimal energy states of higher bands typically have complex orbital geometries such that an efficient selective coherent transfer from the basically structureless condensate wave function in the ground state of the lowest band appears hopeless , since it would require the engineering of exceedingly complex excitation operators .",
    "hence , the best possible choice is an excitation process , which populates a mixture of bloch states energetically close to the minimal energy state of the target band .",
    "if the energy spread introduced in the excitation is kept sufficiently low , tunneling and elastic collisions may allow for a re - thermalisation of the sample with a significant condensate fraction in the minimal energy state and a thermal population of higher energy states within the band .",
    "a number of challenges come with this consideration .",
    "1 . the minimal energy state and the states nearby should be long - lived and in particular stable against two - body collisions .",
    "an excitation mechanism is required , which can populate bloch states sufficiently close to the minimal energy state of some band .",
    "3 . tunneling should be equally possible in each direction within the lattice , in order to enable the formation of cross - dimensional coherence in a thermalisation process . as discussed in the following sections , a solution to these three requirements turns out possible in a bipartite square lattice with a rapidly tunable unit cell .",

    "the final values of @xmath18 and @xmath81 are chosen sufficiently large such that the atoms exclusively populate the lowest @xmath11-orbitals of the deep wells , and the relative phases between the local wave functions in different wells are nearly indeterminate due to interaction - driven squeezing of the particle number fluctuations .",
    "this lack of phase coherence is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig.5](a ) by the black cross between adjacent deep wells . in step 2",
    ", @xmath20 is tuned from the negative to the positive side , such that the deep wells become the shallow wells and vice versa .",
    "this leads to the configuration shown in ( b ) .",
    "the time scale for this step is adjusted to be short with respect to tunneling ( on the order of 1 ms ) but long with respect to the on - site vibration period ( on the order of 10 @xmath82s ) .",
    "this ensures that during this process the local wave function is not affected by tunneling , and that it adiabatically adjusts to the changing depth of the local potential well .",
    "different target values of @xmath20 yield population of different bands .",
    "the precise value of @xmath20 is adjusted such that , for the lowest energy state in the target band , the population of the deep wells is minimized .",
    "this choice has two important consequences .",
    "it maximizes the band lifetime , as has been discussed in the previous section , and it gives rise to a state that is energetically close to the minimal energy state , such that a subsequent thermalisation process can lead to bose - einstein condensation in the band minima with a significant condensate fraction .",
    "for example , if the target band is the second band , the minimal energy wave function is comprised of local @xmath11-orbitals with relative local phases of @xmath83 in adjacent shallow wells , connected via @xmath2-orbitals in the deep wells , which are minimally populated if @xmath20 is chosen appropriately ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.5](c ) ) .",
    "hence , the state produced after step 2 in ( b ) differs from the minimal energy state indicated in ( c ) only by the indeterminate phase relations between the @xmath11-orbitals and the missing populations in the @xmath2-orbitals .",
    "note that the preparation of indeterminate phase relations in step 2 is energetically more favorable than that of wrongly fixed phase relations .",
    "the third step is to give the atoms time to tunnel and collide within the lattice , thus re - establishing thermal equilibrium .",

    "the bands with different @xmath86 are energetically separated by a significant amount , while those with the same @xmath86 are very closely spaced .",
    "it is then seen in ( b ) that , as @xmath20 is tuned from the negative to the positive side , the bands arising from the initially deep wells increase while those resulting from the initially shallow wells decrease in energy , which successively leads to weakly avoided band crossings .",
    "the @xmath20 scan is sufficiently fast that populations pass across these avoided crossings . as a consequence , the population of the initially lowest band ( orange disk in ( b ) )",
    "can be transferred into the 2nd , the 4th , the 7th or some higher band ( violet squares in ( b ) ) .",

    "only a few examples have been considered yet , which however clearly illustrate the wealth of new physics arising when orbital degrees of freedom come into play in optical lattice systems .",
    "orbital degrees of freedom provide two most interesting consequences : directionality of tunneling and interactions , and orbital degeneracy . as a consequence of the latter",

    "in our work with bosonic atoms in the second band of a bipartite square lattice , orbital degeneracy is the basis for the emergence of interaction - induced chiral superfluidity .",
    "an obvious next step is to also study orbital physics in optical lattices with fermions .",
    "excited bands can come with interesting topological structure , which in addition to the physics associated with broken symmetries can give rise to exotic phenomena like , for example , topologically protected chiral edge states .",

    "<S> bipartite lattice geometries have allowed us to implement appropriate band structures , which meet three basic requirements : the existence of metastable excited states sufficiently protected from collisional band relaxation , a mechanism to excite the atoms initially prepared in the lowest band with moderate entropy increase , and the possibility of cross - dimensional tunneling dynamics , necessary to establish coherence along all lattice axes . a variety of bands can be selectively populated and a subsequent thermalisation process leads to the formation of a condensate in the lowest energy state of the chosen band . as examples the 2nd , 4th and 7th bands in a bipartite square lattice are discussed . in the 2nd and 7th band , </S>",
    "<S> the band geometry can be tuned such that two inequivalent energetically degenerate energy minima arise at the @xmath0-points at the edge of the 1st brillouin zone . in this case </S>",
    "<S> even a small interaction energy is sufficient to lock the phase between the two condensation points such that a complex - valued chiral superfluid order parameter can emerge , which breaks time reversal symmetry . in the 4th band </S>",
    "<S> a condensate can be formed in the @xmath1-point in the center of the 1st brillouin zone , which can be used to explore topologically protected band touching points . the new techniques to access orbital degrees of freedom in higher bands </S>",
