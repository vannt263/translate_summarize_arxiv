    "the field of quantum information processing by using rydberg atoms has attracted intense interests due to the strong and long - range dipole - dipole interaction  @xcite .",

    "it has been proposed to make use of rydberg atoms to realize a quantum repeater  @xcite , which is an essential component for demonstrating long - distance quantum communication suffering from transmission loss  @xcite .",
    "another important requirement for a quantum network is the ability to delay or even store quantum information for a certain time . here",
    "the bi - chromatic excitation scheme involving long - lived rydberg states can be superior to common lambda schemes connecting different hyperfine - states by the mere frequency difference between pump and probe beams . additionally , rydberg four - wave mixing ( fwm )",
    "adds nonlinearities to the medium induced from the strong interaction between rydberg atoms , and hence the fwm process can be used for creating the non - classical light fields .",
    "these interactions have been discussed and experimentally demonstrated for the generation of single - photon sources  @xcite and the manipulation of quantum state  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the combination of fwm and blockade effects is one approach towards quantum repeaters .    most of the relevant research is realized in doppler - free ultracold ensembles , providing intrinsically long coherence times .",
    "however , thermal vapors can reduce the complexity of such setups , but here the doppler effect has to be taken into account . by driving the transitions intensely and probing on time scales short compared to the movement of the atoms , the studies of the optical nonlinearities to single - photon level can be extended to such systems  @xcite .",

    "both are demonstrated in a ladder - type excitation scheme .",
    "moreover , in a pulsed fwm scheme as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : scheme](a ) , a motion - induced signal revival shortly after the incident pulse has been experimentally investigated and theoretically analyzed by considering the velocity distribution of the atoms  @xcite .",
    "the revival peak can be attributed to the constructive interference between the coherences of different velocity classes .    in this paper , we present pulsed fwm signals of durations that are long compared to the duration of the excitation pulse .",
    "the fwm process is conducted in a resonant diamond excitation scheme , addressed from the @xmath2 ground state .",
    "a cw 795 nm and a pulsed 474 nm laser field drive the two - photon transition to the rydberg state via an intermediate state .",
    "another 480 nm cw laser couples the rydberg state to the @xmath0 state and converts the atomic excitation back into a light field at 780 nm .",
    "the dynamics we studied here is beyond the frozen - gas regime , so that the atomic velocities still have a crucial influence on the temporal evolution of the generated signal .",
    "different velocity classes exhibit different temporal phase and amplitude evolution of the signal .",
    "therefore , the signal re - occurs after the incident pulse due to the constructive interference between different velocity classes .",
    "this is a collective effect @xcite , since it originates from the interference of a group of atoms and can not be explained by single - atom behavior . as it is based on a superposition of individually acting atoms ,",
    "there is no cooperativity between them .",
    "but such rydberg - rydberg interaction effects have already been demonstrated in thermal vapor  @xcite and will be an essential tool in the future .",
    "compared to the off - resonant pulsed fwm in ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath3ghz and @xmath4mhz ) , the temporal structures of the fwm signals in a resonant fwm scheme exhibit more structure and are much more sensitive to the excitation bandwidth to rydberg state .",
    "in other words , the signals are sensitive to the laser rabi frequencies .",
    "the laser beams have spatial gaussian shapes , so that the spatial profiles of all lasers have to be taken into account in order to achieve an agreement between experiment and theory .",
    "we confine rubidium atoms in a 220@xmath1 m thick vapor cell , heated up to 140@xmath5c .",

    "we then individually lock the 474 nm and 480 nm laser frequencies to rydberg - eit signals .",
    "note that the 780 nm laser is only used for frequency reference , which is not sent to the vapors .",

    "the light transmission through the uncoated vapor cell is around @xmath16 for all beams .",
    "all powers of the laser beams have been measured right in front of the cell .",
    "the power of 795 nm laser is varied from 5 to 200@xmath1w , corresponding to rabi frequencies @xmath17 between 55 and 345mhz . because the dipole matrix element to the rydberg state is two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the ground state transition , the pulsed 474 nm laser field is produced by a dye amplifier with full - width - at - half - maximum of 2.3ns  @xcite and peak power of 23w , implying the rabi frequency of @xmath18ghz .",
    "the setup for the pulsed laser is similar to that in ref .",
    "the power of the 480 nm laser field is fixed to 20mw in all measurements , corresponding to a rabi frequency of @xmath1945mhz .",
    "all laser fields have the same linear polarization . before sending the pulsed 474 nm light field into the atomic ensembles , the system is initially in a steady state among a two - level system which is driven by the 795 nm cw laser field ( the 480 nm laser field is also cw , but in steady state it has no effect on the atoms ) .",
    "when the pulse arrives , the intermediate and rydberg state get coupled strongly and the transmission of 795 nm through the atomic vapor starts to oscillates coherently @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "the cw 480 nm laser drives the de - excitation to the @xmath0 state . the three incident light fields build up a coherence between the states @xmath2 and @xmath0 , due to the four - wave mixing ( energy conservation ) and phase matching condition ( momentum conservation ) . as a consequence",
    "the generated 780 nm field is a strongly directional emission . in the experimental setup ,",
    "four additional bandpass filters are inserted in front of an avalanche photodiode ( apd ) in order to suppress the stray light of the three incident fields ; and a neutral - density ( nd ) filter is used for attenuating the generated light on few - photons level to single - photon level ( in order to prevent saturation of the detector ) .",
    "the repetition rate of the laser pulse is 50hz and all measurements are averaged up to 50,000 runs .",
    "the temporal structure of the generated fwm signals strongly depends on the individual powers for the 795 nm laser of the resonant fwm scheme , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a)-[fig : fig2](c ) . after the incident laser pulse , the fwm signals at weaker 795 nm laser fields show longer dephasing times .",

    "after the pulse , as mentioned above , the coherence variation of each velocity class depends on its velocity , so that the unimodal velocity distribution leads to another maximum signal ( rephasing ) and the signal subsequent decreases to zero ( dephasing ) . on the other hand ,",
    "more velocity classes are selected in the resonant scheme ( solid line ) .",

    "in contrast to off - resonant fwm , in the resonant scheme the temporal profiles of the output signals have a richer structure and are strongly sensitive to the laser power .",
