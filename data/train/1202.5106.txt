    "we see that the change of both statistics is not much different .",
    "this can be basically explained by the idea that losses annihilate some photons , which in particular affects the statistics for small number of counts .",

    ", we find that the change from the perfect to the noise case is also qualitatively similar in both cases . for sufficiently weak stray light , the noise effects essentially contribute to the statistiscs at small numbers . here",
    "we have to note that a fair comparison of both statistics requires that the noise counts of each on / off  detector are only @xmath61 . since we have to add up the signal of the pnr detector system over the @xmath0 detectors , the total number of noise counts adds up @xmath62 .    in the fourths",
    "row we combine both effects of imperfections .",
    "also the combined effects of losses and noise counts are qualitatively similar in the two scenarios . in practice , the experimenters try to keep dark and stray - light counts as small as possible , so they also contribute mainly to the events at a small number of counts .",
    "hence the cutoff at a finite but sufficiently large number of on / off detectors is not very important for the effects of the considered imperfections . from these arguments",
    "it becomes clear that the main differences of both detection scenarios are expected to occur due to the cutoff relative to the signal field to be detected , rather than due to the considered imperfections .",
    "let us address the question of systematical errors from pnr detectors .",
    "for example , the true photon statistics of a quantum state can be used to determine nonclassical effects .",

    "the plotted negativities are a result of the on / off detectors , and they must not be interpreted as nonclassical effects .",
    "note that such effects from on / off detectors also appear in measurements of bell parameters  @xcite .",
    "parameter for the counting statistics measured by a pnr detector with @xmath0 on / off detectors .",
    "the computed example is a classical coherent state with @xmath70 .",
    "note that @xmath71 denotes a measurement with a single on / off detector , and its q value is close to -1 .",
    ", width=226 ]    the @xmath64 parameter for a coherent state with a mean photon number @xmath72 measured by @xmath0 on / off detectors is @xmath73 .",
    "the pnr @xmath64 parameter tends to the expected value zero for @xmath74 , which is equivalent to the fact that the binomial distribution converges to the poisson one , see  appendix  [ app : convergence ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig : qmandel ] it follows that a number of @xmath75 bins is not sufficient to infer poisson photon statistics , @xmath76 , from the measured pnr statistics for @xmath70 .",
    "remarkably , in this case the number of on / off detectors exceeds the mean photon number of the state by one order of magnitude .",
    "a careful interpretation of quantum effects requires that such systematic errors have to be taken into account , when measuring with pnr detectors .",

    "<S> the result renders it possible to compare the corresponding measured counting statistics with the true photon number statistics of arbitrary quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> the photo - counting formula is applied to the discrimination of photon numbers of fock states , squeezed states , and odd coherent states . </S>",
    "<S> it is illustrated for coherent states that our formula is indispensable for the correct interpretation of quantum effects observed with such devices . </S>"
