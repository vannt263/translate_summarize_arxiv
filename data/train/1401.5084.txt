    "f - theory @xcite is a very fruitful patch in the string landscape to connect string theory to particle physics phenomenology .",
    "it has the potential to realize exceptional gauge groups and as such it provides a promising starting point for engineering grand unified theories ( guts)@xcite .",
    "being the non - perturbative formulation of type  iib string theory , f - theory is expected to inherit its successful mechanisms for moduli stabilization .",
    "hence it allows for a realization of a bottom - up approach to string model building  @xcite .",
    "here we focus on engineering gut theories in standard f - theory @xmath2 compactifications on elliptically fibered calabi ",
    "yau fourfolds @xmath3 with base space @xmath4 the fiber degenerations over the base manifold @xmath5 encode the particle content as well as the corresponding interactions of the theory : if the fiber becomes singular at complex codimension one in the base , this singularity corresponds to gauge degrees of freedom for a non - abelian symmetry of the ade - type .",
    "matter fields arise along so - called matter curves which are codimension two loci in the base . finally , from codimension three singularities , i.e.  points at which the matter curves intersect",
    ", one can obtain the corresponding yukawa couplings .",
    "we follow the usual model building strategy by considering a local four - cycle @xmath6 in the base , along which the fiber degeneration leads to an symmetry .",
    "then one identifies the matter curves giving rise to @xmath7- and @xmath8-plets and turns on fluxes along these curves to obtain a net chirality of the matter fields .",
    "flux along the hypercharge direction is used to break the 5 to the standard model gauge group and to project out exotic triplet matter  @xcite .",
    "we assume here that these local constructions can be embedded in a global compactification such that the hypercharge remains massless , as has been shown in explicit global realizations  @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the flux is such that problems with gauge coupling unification can be avoided  @xcite .    as in many other model building approaches , additional",
    "1 symmetries are used in to generate a phenomenologically viable structure of operators  @xcite . in this setup , already the consistency conditions from four - dimensional anomaly cancellation place severe constraints on the local gut construction  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , previous explorations ( see for instance  @xcite ) have shown that dangerous operators ( e.g.  proton decay operators ) tend to carry the same 1 charges as desired couplings ( e.g.  yukawa couplings ) .",
    "as of now there is no consistent local setup with just the mssm matter content and phenomenologically acceptable couplings .    in the spectral cover approach to f - theory model building , the 1 symmetries are realized as cartan elements of an enhanced gauge group which can be maximally an @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "this gauge group is constraining the 1 charges that can appear upon breakdown to an @xmath10 gauge group .",
    "more generally , 1 symmetries in f - theory are associated with extra sections of the elliptic fibration @xcite , which appear in addition to the generic zero section which specifies the base space .",
    "significant progress has been made in constructing these sections and computing the 1 charges for the matter representations and the singlets  @xcite .",
    "these new 1 symmetries allow for a wider pattern of charges as compared to the 1 symmetries arising in spectral cover constructions .    in this paper",
    "we explore the pattern of 1 charges that can arise from the constructions outlined above and address the question of whether an exact mssm construction can be obtained consistently within this class of f - theory compactifications .",
    "we systematically search for models that have the exact mssm spectrum ( up to singlet extensions ) , satisfy the four - dimensional anomaly cancellation conditions , and allow for phenomenologically viable couplings .",
    "in contrast to previous f - theory gut model building , where one requires the mssm fields to arise from complete 5 representations , we allow for incomplete multiplets  a feature which commonly appears in the heterotic mini - landscape  @xcite .",
    "following this strategy we revisit f - theory model building based on spectral cover constructions and take steps towards model building based on models with rational sections .",
    "we assume that the breakdown of the grand unified group in rational section models can proceed via hypercharge flux breaking , as in models based on the spectral cover .",
    "we focus on constructions with up to two additional 1 factors . for models with rational sections ,",
    "we consider those with toric sections where the matter curves and the 1 charges have been worked out .",
    "in this class we find examples that satisfy all constraints derived from imposing phenomenologically viable couplings and four - dimensional anomaly cancellation , apart from the @xmath11-anomaly discussed in  @xcite , whose presence depends on the embedding of the local model in the global compactification . under the assumption that this anomaly can be canceled by an appropriate green  schwarz ( gs ) mechanism , we present one benchmark model in detail where the standard @xmath12 matter parity can be realised .",
    "we then search for extensions of the currently available 1 symmetries which follow a similar charge pattern as that appearing in rational section models , and ask which ones allow for a model satisfying all anomaly conditions , including the @xmath11 anomaly , and thus do not rely on an explicit realization of the gs mechanism mentioned above . in this way we find lamppost models",
    "whose geometric realization would be very intriguing .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : review ] we briefly review the basics of model building in f - theory , with special focus on the spectral cover and the recent constructions with rational sections , which can be skipped by the experienced or only phenomenologically interested readers . in section  [ sec : modelbuilding ] we explain our systematic search and present our results .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] and provide a second benchmark model in appendix  [ sec : appendixbenchmarkmodel2 ] .",
    "f - theory can be thought of as a non - perturbative formulation of type iib string theory ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) . it is a twelve - dimensional theory in which two dimensions are spanned by an elliptic curve",
    ". these two extra dimensions are not physical but can be regarded as a bookkeeping device that encodes in its complex structure the variation of the type iib axio - dilaton @xmath13 we focus on elliptically fibered compactification spaces which can be described algebraically in terms of the short weierstrass form @xmath14 where @xmath15 are homogeneous coordinates in @xmath16 , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are sections of the base @xmath5 .",
    "thus the fibration over the base is completely determined by @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the fiber degenerates at points where the discriminant @xmath19 vanishes . at these points",
    "one can observe the usual monodromies for the axio - dilaton which occur at places where d7 branes sit .",
    "these fiber degenerations encode valuable information for particle physics . at complex codimension one in the base @xmath5 ,",
    "one obtains the gauge degrees of freedom : the corresponding gauge symmetry can be inferred from the vanishing order of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath20 according to the kodaira classification @xcite .",
    "a more intuitive picture on how the gauge symmetry arises is available from the duality to m - theory : one can smoothen out ( blow - up ) the singularities by replacing them with a tree of @xmath21 s .",
    "the intersection matrix of the @xmath21 s is the ( negative of the ) affine cartan matrix of the ade type lie groups where the torus plays the role of the affine node . on the m - theory side",
    ", one can argue that in the limit where all @xmath21 s shrink to zero size , m2 branes wrapping the @xmath21 s become massless , giving then rise to the necessary degrees of freedom of an ade type gauge theory .",
    "similar arguments lead to the conclusion that at higher codimensions in the base one encounters the matter representations ( codimension two ) and their yukawa interactions ( at codimension three in the base ) .      for some f - theory compactifications , the spectral cover construction is a widely - used method to keep track of the various matter curves and gauge enhancements in explicit geometric backgrounds . in this approach , it is useful to consider the tate form instead of the short weierstrass form @xmath22 where the @xmath23 s are again sections of the base .",
    "and the cube in @xmath24 and subsequently redefining the fields . ] in this form , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and the discriminant @xmath20 of are given in terms of the @xmath23 by @xmath25 where @xmath26 the gauge symmetry one obtains for a given singularity can be inferred from the vanishing order of the @xmath23 according to the tate classification @xcite . since our focus is on 5 guts which are further broken down to the sm gauge group , we are interested in a tate or weierstrass model that has an 5 singularity over a certain divisor @xmath6 ( which is of complex codimension one in the base @xmath5 ) @xmath27 to obtain the vanishing orders of an 5 singularity , we express the @xmath23 s in terms of @xmath28 and polynomials @xmath29 which do not contain overall factors of @xmath28 as @xmath30 the @xmath29 are sections of the bundle @xmath31 where @xmath32 , with @xmath33 and @xmath34 the first chern class of the tangent and the normal bundle of @xmath6 , respectively .    inserting the parametrization into , we find for the discriminant @xmath20 @xmath35\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath36 the vanishing order of @xmath28 in @xmath20 is increased to 6 or 7 on the subloci where @xmath37 or @xmath38 vanish , respectively .",
    "this hints at an 6 and gauge group enhancement .",
    "matter fields arise at the intersections of @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) with @xmath41 .",
    "the type of matter expected for each of these cases can be deduced from the decomposition of the adjoint representations into irreducible representations of @xmath421 : @xmath43 from the 6 enhancements one obtains the @xmath44-plets whereas the @xmath45-plets of 5 originate from the enhancements .",
    "the spectral cover construction keeps the information of the various matter curves and gauge enhancements only in the vicinity of the gut divisor @xmath41 , which means that in one neglects possible terms involving @xmath28 in the @xmath29 s . to access this information one constructs a projective auxiliary ( non - cy ) threefold which contains the information about the discriminant locus in a hypersurface of this auxiliary space .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the following hypersurface with affine parameter @xmath46 @xmath47 the correspondence with the matter curves is now as follows : from we see that e.g.   the spectral surface at @xmath48 has @xmath49 , i.e.  to the loci of enhancements where @xmath40 ( cf .  , ) .",
    "more generally , there is a local enhancement to 8 and one then parameterizes the enhancements of 5 to or 6 in terms of a breaking of the fully enhanced 8 into these groups . in order to obtain an 5 gut surface in this construction",
    ", the structure group of the bundle that is responsible for the breaking of 8 has to be 5 . in order to distinguish the two 5 factors we call the latter @xmath50 . in terms of @xmath51 ,",
    "the adjoint decomposes as @xmath52 the 5 matter can then be identified via their charges under the @xmath53 cartan subalgebra , which we characterize by the 5 weights @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "the @xmath54 s fulfill the tracelessness condition @xmath56 to ensure that the structure group is 5 rather than 5 . from",
    "we see that the @xmath8 matter of 5 is paired with the @xmath57 of @xmath50 , the @xmath58 gut matter is paired with the @xmath59 , and the gut singlets are paired with the adjoint of @xmath50 . thus the corresponding five @xmath8-curves @xmath60 , ten @xmath7-curves @xmath61 , and 24 singlet curves @xmath62 are given in terms of the @xmath54 via    [ eq : screpres ] @xmath63 the @xmath29 s can be expressed as symmetric polynomials of degree @xmath64 in the @xmath54 s . in particular , @xmath65 .",
    "thus , on the @xmath60-curves , one of the @xmath54 vanishes , leaving one cartan generator of @xmath50 unbroken .",
    "this reduces the structure group and allows for an enhancement from 5 to .",
    "likewise , by plugging the @xmath54 s into @xmath37 , we find at the loci exhibiting @xmath66 enhancement that @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "furthermore , we have @xmath69 .",
    "this is in accordance with the fact that there is no @xmath70-term in the tate form , which would have a coefficient @xmath71 in .",
    "albeit concise , the spectral cover loses the information about possible monodromies for the @xmath54 s . in other words ,",
    "some of the matter curves might be identified identified away from the @xmath9 point , leading to fewer curves .",
    "thus , depending on the monodromies , there can be zero to four extra 1 symmetries appearing .",
    "each 1 is related to a polynomial of smaller degree @xmath72 in the affine parameter @xmath46 , which can be factored out of the spectral cover equation , such that all @xmath72 s sum to five and that the term @xmath73 does not occur . for one 1 ,",
    "the spectral cover has to split into two polynomials , which leaves us with the two possibilities of either a linear and a quartic polynomial ( @xmath74 factorization ) or a quadratic and a cubic polynomial ( @xmath75 factorization ) .",
    "since there is only one 1 , the @xmath54 s are identified by monodromies ( e.g.  @xmath76 and @xmath77 in the @xmath75 factorization ) .",
    "for the case of two 1 symmetries one proceeds in a similar way , finding a @xmath78 factorization and a @xmath79 factorization .",
    "we summarize the matter fields and their 1 charges , which can be calculated from the possible 8 embeddings , in table  [ tab : splittings ] .",
    ".1 charges of @xmath80 representations for different factorizations with up to two 1 factors .",
    "the indices specify the @xmath50 cartan weights according to .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in the previous section we only considered the subclass of polytopes which have been studied in the literature so far .",
    "for example , the polytopes @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 still remain to be analyzed . also , one could have additional , non - toric , base dependent 1 symmetries which could lead to different phenomenological patterns . as all of the above models do not satisfy the anomaly constraints quadratic in the 1 symmetries",
    ", one has to determine to which extent this constraint applies and how models can circumvent such constraints as for example suggested in the context of type iib constructions  @xcite .    in this section",
    "we want to explore possible bottom - up models in which the field theory anomaly coefficient actually vanishes so there is no need to rely on a geometric construction of canceling this anomaly .",
    "the aim is to provide a guideline for future geometric engineering efforts and it would be very interesting to obtain explicit realizations with such charges .    based on the observation that the 1 charges are all fixed ( up to mod five ) to a certain value given by the corresponding splitting and the intersection numbers of the fiber components with the rational section , we consider the possibility of having further models with two 1 symmetries whose splitting gives rise to any of those charge assignments in table  [ tab : charges ] .",
    "furthermore , we assume that such models allow for more @xmath84-curves , but only one @xmath85-curve as before .",
    "these additional @xmath84-curves allow for more freedom to satisfy the anomaly constraints .",
    "the @xmath84-curves are chosen to have charges @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are fixed by the splitting that is chosen for each 1 .",
    "the integer valued @xmath89 are in the range @xmath90\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the charge of the @xmath85-curve is chosen such that it fits the structure of a given split , see table  [ tab : charges ] . the flux distribution and the search strategy in this case then follows the one described in section  [ sec : search ] .",
    "for example , in the context of models where the 1 generators follow the 4 - 1 , 3 - 2 splitting , we find @xmath91 models which satisfy all anomaly conditions , in particular also , and have all unwanted operators forbidden at tree level . out of those ,",
    "some are found to allow for suitable 1 charges which lead to the desired operator structure .",
    "an example is the model given in table  [ tab : benchmarkbeyondrs ] .",
    "note that the analysis of the previous section still applies , since all @xmath85-curves have the same charge .    in this benchmark model",
    "two singlets ( or correspondingly appropriate instanton effects ) , denoted by @xmath92 and @xmath93 , could generate the @xmath94-term and all yukawa couplings .",
    "the charges for these fields have to be @xmath95 which is similar to charges appearing in the benchmark models of the previous section .",
    "one slight difference is that one expects a higher suppression for the @xmath94-term since it is generated after two singlet insertions .",
    "note that again we need a singlet with charge @xmath96 in the first 1 to generate the desired coupling structure .",
    "finally , we want to remark that we find significantly less phenomenologically appealing models when one of the additional u(1 ) symmetries results from a 5 - 0 split charge pattern ( see table [ tab : splittings ] ) .",
    "the reason for this might be that not only operators but the matter fields themselves have charges divisible by five , just as the singlet charges .",
    "this situation makes it difficult to retain a surviving symmetry which could help to control the dangerous couplings .",
    "in this paper we presented various interesting local f - theory models that have the potential to lead to a realistic gut theory from string theory .",
    "for the first time we obtained models that satisfy all consistency conditions ( four - dimensional anomaly cancellation and phenomenologically interesting couplings ) and do not contain exotic matter .",
    "we concentrated on f - theory 5 models which have up to two additional 1 symmetries and allow for the three generations of quarks and leptons to arise from incomplete 5 representations . to find these appealing models we analyzed a class of models with toric sections",
    "whose geometric setup has been discussed recently in the literature , models arising within the spectral cover , and bottom - up models which feature 1 charges of the same type , but lack an explicit geometric realization at this stage .",
    "our scan revealed phenomenologically interesting models in a subclass of the toric section constructions and in the bottom - up searches .",
    "a special feature of these models is that all matter from @xmath85-curves stay in complete multiplets which share the same charges under the additional 1 symmetries , while in contrast the @xmath97-plets are usually split .",
    "this `` half - complete '' multiplet structure makes it possible to relate the charges of all operators among each other and is sufficient for generating phenomenologically interesting couplings .",
    "in particular , both types of models feature the top quark yukawa coupling at tree level whereas the @xmath94-term and all baryon and lepton number violating operators are forbidden .",
    "we identified a singlet vev configuration which promises to induce a realistic yukawa structure , while all dimension four proton decay operators stay forbidden .",
    "we could further relate this situation to the presence of a residual matter parity .    at this stage",
    "we have postponed various phenomenologically relevant questions which have to be addressed when embedding the local models in a global string compactification . in particular we assumed a breakdown of the 5 gauge group to that of the standard model via hypercharge flux such that the hypercharge remains massless .",
    "in addition , we assumed that gauge coupling unification is not spoiled by large threshold corrections .",
    "for the subclass of models with toric sections and an explicit geometric realization we assumed an appropriate green  schwarz mechanism which can cancel the @xmath98@xmath99@xmath100 anomaly as motivated from the type iib side . note that this last anomaly is absent in our bottom - up models by construction and thus the last assumption need not be made there .",
    "there are various interesting future research directions",
    ". it would be intriguing to find an explicit geometric realization of the bottom - up models presented here , and to construct compactifications that realize the above assumptions on hypercharge flux , gauge coupling unification and green  schwarz anomaly - cancellation .",
    "given such a realization one of the next avenues might be to combine these local models with moduli stabilization .",
    "we hope to return to some of these questions in the near future .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank hans peter nilles for collaboration at early stages of this project and for helpful comments and suggestions .",
    "furthermore we want to thank michael blaszczyk , herbi dreiner , rolf kappl , jan keitel , denis klevers , fernando marchesano , fernando quevedo , and timo weigand for helpful discussions .",
    "this work was partially supported by the sfb - transregio tr33 the dark universe ( deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ) and the european union 7th network program unification in the lhc era ( pitn - ga-2009 - 237920 ) .",
    "the work of fr was supported by the german science foundation ( dfg ) within the collaborative research center ( sfb ) 676 `` particles , strings and the early universe '' .",
    "here we present a second benchmark model based on the top @xmath101 whose spectrum is given in table [ tab : topcharges ] .",
