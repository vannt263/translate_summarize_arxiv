    "it is well known that superconductivity and ferromagnetism are two competing orders .",

    ", the coexistence of the two orders is due to the proximity effect @xcite .",
    "the main manifestation of the proximity effect in s / f structures is the damped oscillatory behavior of superconducting correlations in the f layer .",
    "two characteristic lengths of the decay and the oscillations are , respectively , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "therefore in s / f heterostructures there is a unique possibility to study the properties of superconducting electrons under the influence of the exchange field in the ferromagnet .",
    "recent progress in the preparation of the high quality s / f layered structures permitted to experimentally observe many striking phenomena that are quite interesting for applications such as a non - monotonic dependence of their critical temperature and oscillations of critical current in s / f / s josephson junctions as a function of the f layer thickness ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is possible to fabricate josephson @xmath2 junctions with a @xmath2-phase difference in the ground state , which are good candidates for elements in superconducting logic circuits @xcite .",
    "sifs junctions , i.e. s / f / s trilayers with one transparent interface and one tunnel barrier between s and f layers , represent an interesting case of @xmath2 junctions for applications where active josephson junctions are required .",
    "the sifs structure offers the freedom to tune the critical current density over a wide range and at the same time to realize high values of the product of the junction critical current @xmath3 and its normal state resistance @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "in addition , nb based tunnel junctions are usually underdamped , which is desired for many applications .",
    "sifs junctions are also interesting from the fundamental point of view since they provide a convenient model system for a comparative study between @xmath5-@xmath2 transitions observed from the critical current and from the density of states ( dos ) @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to provide a quantitative model describing the dos in sifs junctions and to calculate current - voltage characteristics of a sifs junction .",

    "since we calculate the dos at the free boundary of the ferromagnet in the fs bilayer , we need to set to zero the @xmath43 derivative at the left s / f interface , @xmath44 at the right f / s interface the boundary conditions are given by the relations @xcite ,    [ kl ] @xmath45    where @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the conductivity of the s layer and @xmath48 .",
