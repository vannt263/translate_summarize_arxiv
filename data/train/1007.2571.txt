    "non - singular bouncing cosmology @xcite has become one of the important alternative scenarios of inflation @xcite as a description of the early universe . in terms of a bounce scenario",
    ", the universe travels from a contracting phase to an expanding phase through a non - vanishing minimal size , avoiding the singularity problem which plagues the standard big bang theory @xcite or inflationary theory @xcite .",
    "moreover , a bounce can occur much below the planck scale , eliminating the  transplanckian \" problem of which the wavelength of the fluctuation mode we see today will be even smaller than planck scale and thus in  the zone of ignorance \" where high energy effects are robust and einstein equations might be invalid @xcite . in bounce models ,",
    "fluctuations were generated in contracting phase and transferred into expanding phase through bouncing point , which can give rise to a scale invariant power spectrum as expected by the current observational data @xcite . in order to connect the perturbations in contracting phase and expanding phase at the crossing point , the joint condition of hwang - vishniac @xcite ( deruelle - mukhanov @xcite ) can be applied . besides , bouncing scenario can also be originated from non - relativistic gravity theories @xcite and give rise to gravitational waves with running signature and large non - gaussianities @xcite .    in the previous studies , a kind of ",
    "matter bounce \" has been proposed where before and after the bounce , the universe could behave as non - relativistic matter .",
    "this scenario can be realized by a kind of  lee - wick \" ( lw ) lagrangian which contains higher derivatives of the field , or equivalently by two scalar fields with an opposite sign of potential",
    ". this scenario can give rise to scale invariant power spectrum at large scales , which is consistent with the data @xcite .",
    "however , one may expect that there are some non - minimal couplings of the matter in the universe to einstein gravity in the early universe .",
    "in fact , it is argued that the existence of the non - minimal coupling term is required by the quantum corrections and renormalization @xcite in quantum gravity in curved space - time .",
    "this effect may , by means of modifying einstein equations , alter the previous result and leave some signals on the power spectrum that can be detected by observations such as cmb analysis .",
    "the non - minimal coupling can also be reduced from higher dimensional theories such as brane theory and can get rid of the big bang singularity , which lead to a bouncing universe @xcite , or lead to the cosmic acceleration , which can be utilized as inflaton in the early time @xcite and dark energy at current epoch @xcite .",
    "this paper aims at investigating the perturbations in the matter bounce model involving the non - minimal coupling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we first review the model of matter bounce in sec .",
    "ii . after that , in sec .",
    "iii we take the non - minimal coupling term into account .",
    "we investigate the perturbation through the process in detail , and show the solutions for each stage .",
    "we also analyze the particle production due to the resonance .",
    "all the analytical calculations are done with help of numerical computations .",
    "finally sec .",
    "iv contains conclusions and discussions .",
    "in this section , we will start with the matter bounce model carried out in @xcite .",
    "this model consists of a single scalar field with a high derivative term of a minus sign . due to this term , the equation of state ( eos ) @xmath0 is possible to go down below @xmath1 and violates the null energy condition , which behaves as a _  quintom \" _",
    "matter @xcite and makes it possible to realize a bounce .",
    "it is useful to have such a term added in the lagrangian .",
    "for example , in the well known lee - wick theory which was constructed by t.d .",
    "lee and g. c. wick @xcite ( see also @xcite for the extensive  lee - wick standard model \" ) , the higher derivative term is used to cancel the quadratic divergence of the higgs mass and thus address the  hierarchy problem \" .",
    "it is also possible to construct an ultraviolet complete theory which preserves lorentz invariance and unitarity in terms of lee - wick theory @xcite .",
    "we begin with the lagrangian in our model to be in the form : [ leewick ] l=_^-(^2 ) ^2-m^2 ^ 2-v ( )  , where @xmath2 is the mass of the scalar field @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the potential .",
    "a higher derivative term with minus sign is introduced with some new mass scale @xmath5 . for the higgs sector of lee - wick theory ,",
    "the hierarchy problem is solved if we require that @xmath6 . after some field rotations , one can write down the effective lagrangian : [ leewick2 ] l=_^- _ ^+m^2 ^ 2-m^2 ^ 2-v ( , )  , where @xmath7 is some auxiliary field and @xmath8 is defined as @xmath9 . , which may cause some instability problems @xcite .",
    "that is true but it is not the focus of our paper .",
    "note that we are only interested in the general picture of the bounce , and the auxiliary field is only used as an explicit example for the bounce to happen .",
    "a more general analysis will be taken into consideration in the future work . ] here the mass matrix of the fields has been diagonalized due to the rotation .",
    "usually there may be some interaction terms between the two fields , or some higher order self - interaction terms like @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and so on , but here for simplicity and without losing generality , we will have all of them ignored by setting @xmath13 . in framework of friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric , ds^2=dt^2-a(t)^2d*x*^2  , it is easy to get the friedmann equation as : [ heq ] h^2=  , where @xmath14 , and the equations of motion of the two fields are [ kgeq ] + 3h+m^2&=&0  , + + 3h+m^2&=&0  , respectively .",
    "let us now take a close look at how the model works to give rise to a bouncing scenario .",
    "the bounce happens by the conditions @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which requires that the total energy density vanish at some point in the universe evolution .",
    "starting off in the contracting phase , both the two fields @xmath8 and @xmath7 oscillate around the extrema of their potential with a growing amplitude due to the anti - friction of the negative hubble parameter .",
    "therefore , the energy densities of both fields will grow as @xmath17 , which behaves like non - relativistic matter .",
    "note that the energy density of @xmath7 is negative and its growth will cancel that of the total energy density of the universe . at the beginning",
    ", we assume that it is subdominant than that of @xmath8 , but as @xmath6 , it will grow faster and eventually catch up , canceling all the positive energy density with its kinetic energy overwhelming that of @xmath8 , which makes @xmath16 and cause bounce to happen .",
    "thus we can see that before and after the bounce , the universe can be viewed as",
    " matter domination \" with the effective equation of state @xmath18 , while in the neighborhood of the bounce point , the equation of state goes down to @xmath19 .",
    "it is a good approximation to parameterize @xmath0 in such a way for the following calculations .    in the following section , we will reinvestigate the scenario by taking into account the coupling of the field to einstein gravity .",
    "we assume that the normal scalar couples to the curvature through some non - minimal coupling term such as @xmath20 .",
    "we will analyze in detail the evolution of the perturbations in presence of this term , including the metric perturbations as well as the effects on particle production . to support our analytical calculations",
    ", we will also perform the numerical investigations .",
    "in this section , we investigate the system with the inclusion of the non - minimally coupled term .",
    "generally , we can modify lagrangian ( [ leewick ] ) in a very general form such as : = _ ^-(^2 ) ^2-m^2 ^ 2-v()-f(r)h ( )  , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are functions of the ricci scalar @xmath23 and scalar field @xmath3 , respectively . by writing it in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath7 in analogy to ( [ leewick2 ] )",
    ", we can always have : = _ ^- _ ^+m^2 ^ 2-m^2 ^ 2-v(,)-f_1(r)h_1()-f_2(r)h_2 ( )  , where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are inherited from @xmath28 in the original lagrangian .",
    "usually , these functions are very complicated and difficult to analyze . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we adopt a kind of parametrization form in which the coupling of @xmath8 has a very simple form such as @xmath20 with a coefficient @xmath29 , while that of @xmath7 vanishes .",
    "the parameterized lagrangian is : [ action ] s = d^4x  . from this lagrangian",
    ", we obtain the einstein equations as : [ modeinstein ] g_=g _ [ ^2-^2+m^2 ^ 2-m^2 ^ 2 ] -__+__-2g_(^2+)+2(__+ _ _ )  , and the equations of motion of @xmath8 and @xmath7 : + 3h+m^2+r&=&0  , + + 3h+m^2&=&0  , respectively . in deriving these equations",
    "we have made use of the definition @xmath30 .",
    "( [ modeinstein ] ) yields equation for hubble parameter straightforwardly , which is : h^2= [ ^2-^2+m^2 ^ 2-m^2 ^ 2 + 6h ]  , and the ricci scalar is : r=  .",
    "generally , the additional term will affect the background evolution by modifying the field equations .",
    "this may make the analysis sophisticated and undoable .",
    "moreover , if the modification is too large , the bounce may even be prevented .",
    "however , for the case of weak coupling , it is still suitable for us to preserve the bounce and take assumption that the background evolution is hardly affected .",
    "thus it will be safe to use all the results obtained in the above section without losing fidelity .    to be more accurate , we test the background evolution numerically .",
    "we choose the parameters and initial conditions to be the same as in @xcite .",
    "we find that up to @xmath31 , the background evolution will not be affected very much and a bounce can still happen .",
    "but there may be a little difference , where the universe may enter into a small stage with @xmath32 before bounce , as have been shown in fig .",
    "this is easy to understand from the field equation . in the additional term",
    ", @xmath33 can be viewed as an effective correction to the original mass squared @xmath34 . at the initial stage where @xmath23 is not very large , the correction is negligible , and the field evolves as it does without the additional term .",
    "but as the universe evolves like pressureless matter , @xmath23 will get larger and larger .",
    "when the hubble parameter is about to its maximal value , @xmath35 , the second scalar @xmath7 will begin to dominate the universe where @xmath36 transfers from negative to positive . at this moment , from the definition of @xmath23 , we can see that it suddenly jumps by the amount of @xmath37 .",
    "this behavior makes the energy density dominate the universe again for a short while , leading to @xmath32 in this period . as the energy density of @xmath7 grows up and totally dominates the universe , the equation of state goes down to be below @xmath1 and drives the bounce to happen . at the bouncing point where the total energy density of the universe vanishes",
    ", one can see from fig .",
    "[ eos ] that the equation of state goes down to negative infinity , and as stated before ( in the footnote ) , it is not a real divergence . after the bounce ,",
    "the eos will come up to above @xmath1 again as the time reversal of the pre - bounce process .     and scale factor @xmath38 in a non - minimal coupling matter bounce model as a function of cosmic time @xmath39 ( horizontal axis ) .",
    "the background fields are plotted in dimensionless units by normalizing by the mass @xmath40 , and the time axis is displayed in units of @xmath41 . the mass parameters @xmath2 and @xmath5 are chosen to be @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the initial conditions are @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 . ]      in this section we will focus on the perturbation evolution of our model .",
    "we begin with the perturbed metric , ds^2=a()^2[(1 + 2)d^2-(1 - 2)d*x*^2 ]  , in the conformal form . here",
    "@xmath48 is the conformal time , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are scalar perturbations of the metric .",
    "note that with existence of the non - minimal coupling term , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are no longer equivalent .",
    "similarly , the fields can be represented as homogeneous and fluctuation parts as : & = & _ 0 +  , + & = & _ 0 +  .in the following , we will neglect the subscript  0 \" and take @xmath8 and @xmath7 as background components .",
    "then we will solve the perturbed einstein equations to see their evolutions .      from the perturbed einstein equation , g_=-^2 t _",
    ", we obtain the following equations for perturbation variables : [ offdiagonal ] = -  , [ 0i ] + ( h-)=(-+)++  , & & + 3(h+)+\\{-(2h+3h^2)-- } + & = & \\{(2h+3h^2)-++}++ + & + & ( + ) -(+2h )  , & & + 3h+\\{()^2+m^2 + 6(h+2h^2 ) } + & = & 6 + 24h+3 + 6h+++2 - 2(m^2+r )  , where we have defined @xmath51 .",
    "since the equations are too sophisticated and there is no hope to solve it directly , we resort to the einstein frame by a conformal transformation of the metric @xcite : _ = fg _",
    ".the action ( [ action ] ) is then transformed into the form : = d^4x  .",
    "we introduce two new variables , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which are defined as : & & d  , + & & d  , and rewrite the above action as : = d^4x  .",
    "the perturbed metric will be : ds^2=^2()[(1 + 2)d^2-(1 - 2)d*x*^2 ]  , where @xmath54 .",
    "for the perturbed metric in einstein frame where the off - diagonal components of the perturbed einstein equations vanishes , we have @xmath55 .",
    "this can also be obtained when we consider up to the first order approximation of the perturbed metric , which gives @xmath56 , and @xmath57 where relation between @xmath49 and @xmath50 has already been given in eq .",

    "moreover , eq . ( [ 0i ] ) gives the direct relationship between @xmath58 and the field perturbation , [ relation ] -=  , which is convenient for us to calculate @xmath58 in einstein frame and then transform into the original jordan frame .",

    "particle production is expected in the region where the squared value of momentum scales of the perturbation modes are larger than the potential so that the wkb approximation becomes valid , such as the reheating process at the end of inflation @xcite . here at the bouncing point crossing",
    ", there is also possibilities to produce particles . in the usual case",
    ", we can define another variable @xmath126 , which satisfies equation of motion as : + _",
    ",where @xmath127 . from above we can see that , although the first two terms are positive - determined , there will remain some additional terms due to the geometry of the universe , which would cause @xmath128 to be less than zero .",
    "if this is the case , the field will have tachyonic behavior and will blow up with particle production ( which can be called as tachyonic reheating @xcite ) .",
    "however , if there is a non - minimal coupling term with a negative coupling constant @xmath29 , this effect will get larger since @xmath128 gets a more negative value .",
    "this can be seen from the modified equation of motion which becomes : + [ + m^2-h - h^2-r]= ... this is usually called geometric reheating @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ reheating ] we can see that indeed the particle production gets much enhancement in the non - minimal coupling case than its minimal coupling counterparts .",
    "this is another interesting result in our case which are expected to be tested by the future experiments .",
    "non - minimal coupling is a very popular subject in cosmology and has been widely studied in the literature . in this paper , we have investigated the possibility of generating a matter bounce by the lee - wick type scalar field with a non - minimal coupling term involved , and studied its perturbations . as in the previous work done in @xcite ,",
    "a bounce was obtained when the non - minimal coupling is not too large to have unexpected effects . however , as it gives correction to the effective mass of the field , a short period of deflation / inflation before / after the bounce will happen .    using the standard techniques of calculating perturbations of bounce developed from previous works",
    ", we have calculated the perturbations of the model in detail .",
    "one of the big differences from previous one for minimal coupling is that the non - minimal coupling to gravity causes the difference between the two scalar perturbations @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which will cause very interesting consequences .",
    "we have obtained the solution for each stage of evolution and compiled them together using proper matching conditions .",
    "we have found that the final dominant mode can be inherited nontrivially from the subdominant mode in the zero - th order of wave number @xmath77 due to this difference .",
    "this will lead to the red - tilt of the power spectrum at very large scales , which can be justified in future observation . at the bounce point while higher time derivatives of @xmath129 drive the bounce , in which case the perturbations will transfer through the bounce via a scale - dependent way .",
    "such works were discussed in e.g. @xcite .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for point this to us . ]",
    "another result we obtained is that due to the non - minimal coupling , the particle production of the scalar will get greatly enhanced . in the region of validity of the wkb approximation",
    "when the quantum effects become significant , the field will get excited and produce particles .",
    "this is very common in reheating process .",
    "when there is a negative effective mass squared term in the field equation , the particle production will get enhanced due to tachyonic resonance . in usual cases , the averaged value of perturbations of the scalar field will get an enhancement through bounce time due to geometrical effects .",
    "when a non - minimal coupling term is involved in the field equation , the mass of the field will be corrected . in the case of negative coupling coefficient",
    ", the field will get a more negative effective mass squared , and the particle production will get more efficiently enlarged .",
    "this is also very interesting phenomenon and can be tested by experiments on particle physics .",
    "finally we would like to close with some remarks on future works .",
    "the bounce with non - minimal coupling is very interesting topic since in the early epoch , einstein s gravity is likely to be modified , which can give some valuable effects to the evolution of our universe .",
    "it is deserved to pay attention to this project both from the theoretical side such as the perturbation , non - gaussianity , effects on cmb and so on , and from observational side , such as the constraints , confirmation or even exclusion from experimental data .",
    "all these works are expected to take on in the future .",

    "the hubble parameter defined in jordan frame is : h=  .however , we can also define a hubble parameter in einstein frame , which is : =  , where we have introduced the symbol @xmath133 to represent the cosmic time derivative in einstein frame : @xmath134 , @xmath135 , etc .",
    "we can see from the definitions that the two hubble parameters have the same type of relation to the comoving hubble parameters in their frames : @xmath136 and @xmath137 . reminding the relation @xmath138 , it is easy to find the description of @xmath75 in terms of @xmath129 and @xmath63 : & = &   + & = & - ( )  .furthermore , we can derive its derivatives with respect to cosmic time @xmath97 which are : & = & + h()- ( )  , + & = & + h()+()-()^- ( ) ( )  .",
