    "many nearby main sequence stars are seen to be surrounded by @xmath2m - sized dust known as debris disks ( see review in wyatt 2008 ) .",
    "the dust is short - lived indicating that larger planetesimals are present that feed the observed dust ( backman & paresce 1993 ) .",
    "it is thought that the large planetesimals are destroyed in mutual collisions , creating fragments that also collide to produce yet smaller fragments , and so on until the dust is small enough to be removed from the system by radiation pressure ; i.e. , that there is a continuous size distribution extending from small to large objects known as a collisional cascade .    in this respect",
    "extrasolar debris disks are similar to the asteroid and kuiper belts in the solar system .",
    "the size distribution of large objects in the solar system s belts is well characterised observationally ( gladman et al .",
    "2009 ; fuentes et al .",
    "there remains debate as to the origin of this distribution at the largest sizes ( durda et al .",
    "1998 ; bottke et al .",
    "2005 ; morbidelli et al .",
    "2009 ) , but it is recognised that these populations have undergone , and continue to undergo , collisional evolution which means that their size distributions should also extend down to dust sizes .",
    "exactly how the distributions extrapolate down is less well constrained ( e.g. , schlichting et al .",
    "however , dust is seen in the inner solar system that migrates inwards past the earth due to poynting - robertson drag ( leinert & grn 1990 ; dermott et al .",
    "2001 ) , though it is debated as to whether this dust has an asteroidal or cometary origin ( durda & dermott 1997 ; nesvorn et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "one big difference with extrasolar debris disks is that , to be detected above the light from the star , their dust has to be orders of magnitude more abundant than dust in the solar system .",
    "this means that it has been possible to ignore the effects of p - r drag when studing their evolution , since for such disks collisional timescales ( that scale inversely with total dust mass ) are much shorter than p - r drag timescales ( that are independent of dust mass ) ( wyatt 2005 ) .",
    "the regime of such _ collision - dominated _ disks is now ( relatively ) well understood .",
    "early analytical models treated systems in which the size distribution is defined by a single power law , and showed that disk luminosity is expected to stay constant , but to fall off inversely with age at late times ( dominik & decin 2003 ; wyatt et al .",
    "2007a ) , in a manner consistent with the observed debris disk population ( wyatt et al .",
    "more recent analytical models allow for three phases in the size distribution to allow for planetesimals having a size - dependent dispersal threshold ( lhne et al .",
    "2008 ; heng & tremaine 2009 ) , and provide a better fit to the size distribution expected from more detailed numerical models that solve for the evolution of an input size distribution given assumptions about the outcome of collisions between different sized particles ( krivov et al . 2006 ; thbault & augereau 2007 ) .",
    "however , the analytical models can not fit details in the expected size distribution , which is not just defined by power laws , and neither do they consider effects other than collisions .",
    "there is now a need to understand how loss processes affect the size distribution , and so the detectability , of a debris disk .",
    "current instrumentation is probing dust levels at which drag may start to become important , and as searches for earth - analogs intensify , it is inevitable that lower levels of dust will be probed and the dynamics in this regime needs to be properly understood ( beichman et al .",
    "it is also becoming clear that stellar wind drag , which acts in a similar manner to p - r drag , may be important for young stars with high mass loss rates ( plavchan et al .",
    "2005 ; reidemeister et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "although the competition between collisions and p - r drag has been considered in the solar system ( leinert et al .",
    "1983 ; grn et al . 1985 ; ishimoto 2000 ) , such studies focus on explaining the currently observed dust distribution , and are not readily applicable to earlier epochs or to the debris disks of other stars .",
    "collisional models that do study the long - term evolution of the asteroid belt typically exclude small particles and focus on fitting the large body size distribution ( bottke et al .",
    "2005 ) , whereas models for structures in the zodiacal cloud often only treat the dynamics of individual particles essentially ignoring collisions ( dermott et al .",
    "1994 ; grogan et al .",
    "however , more recently the balance of collisions and p - r drag has been incorporated into codes that evolve size distributions with time and so far results have been presented for two systems ( vitense et al .",
    "2010 ; reidemeister et al .",
    "other models are also being developed that incorporate a ( less detailed ) prescription for collisions into n - body simulations ( stark & kuchner 2009 ; kuchner & stark 2010 ) .",
    "here we present a new scheme that can be used to determine the size distribution of a planetesimal belt undergoing destructive collisions as well as loss processes .",
    "this scheme is not expected to provide a more faithful measure of the size distribution than would be found by evolving a distribution forward in time .",
    "rather its value is in the speed with which the distribution can be determined ( in seconds ) , with its ability to reproduce details in the steady state size distribution , including when loss processes are acting , and with the simplicity of the analytical presentation which permits an analytical understanding of how various processes affect the size distribution .",
    "although the scheme presented here is in its most basic form , considering the 1-dimensional size distribution ( rather than , e.g. , including spatial dimensions ) , and treating collisional destruction with a 1-dimensional redistribution function ( essentially averaging the outcome over all possible collisions ) , extension to extra dimensions is possible in principle .

    "consider a belt of planetesimals in which @xmath3 is the total mass in the @xmath4-th bin , where @xmath5 is the typical size of planetesimals in the bin , and bins are logarithmically spaced in size , with @xmath6 being the largest bin and working to smaller sizes with increasing @xmath4 so that @xmath7 where @xmath8 is approximately the logarithmic bin width , since it is also assumed that @xmath9",
    ". collisions between planetesimals cause the mass to be redistributed amongst the bins , and furthermore loss processes may cause mass to be removed from the belt , and there may be sources that add mass to the belt .",
    "from mass conservation for the @xmath4-th bin @xmath10 where the superscripts @xmath11 refer to the mass gained from collisions in other bins , the mass lost from collisions in this bin , the mass removed by loss processes , and the mass gained from other sources , respectively .",
    "note that our 1-dimensional prescription of the belt does not have a radial dimension and so considers loss processes such as p - r drag as a sink , rather than as a diffusive process ( e.g. gorkavyi et al . 1997 ) .",
    "for now we consider the situation where @xmath12 , but return to loss processes in  [ s : pr ] .",
    "we define the redistribution function @xmath13 to be the fraction of mass leaving the @xmath14-th bin from collisions that goes into the @xmath4-th bin .",
    "since mass must be conserved @xmath15 . in this paper the model is being applied to situations in which collisions are destructive , so that @xmath16 and @xmath17 , though it may be possible to extend this to situations where accretion can also take place ( see , e.g. , birnstiel et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "let us further assume that the redistribution function is scale independent , so that @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is any integer , which we can implement by defining a new redistribution function needing just one parameter @xmath20 . putting this into equation  ( [ eq : mdotk ] ) and giving collisional gains and losses in terms of the redistribution function we find @xmath21    if we assume that the size distribution is in quasi - steady state , so that @xmath22 , and append @xmath23 to any subscripts of quantities that are calculated in steady state , we find that @xmath24 since @xmath25 , then as long as @xmath26 , one solution to equation  ( [ eq : ss1 ] ) must be that @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a constant ; i.e. , the mass loss rate in logarithmic bins is independent of size .",
    "note that the main assumption to arrive at this result was that the redistribution function is scale independent .",
    "however , there is a further assumption regarding whether the size distribution is infinite in extent ( e.g. , dohnanyi 1969 ) .",
    "truncated distributions are considered in more detail in following sections , but here we note that for distributions truncated at large sizes , equation  ( [ eq : ss2 ] ) is expected to apply at sizes for which the mass that would have been replenished from sizes above the truncation is negligible ( i.e. , it applies for @xmath29 and redistribution functions that are weighted toward larger sizes ) .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : ss1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ss2 ] ) can be used to determine the steady state size distribution , @xmath30 . to do so",
    ", we consider that the mass loss rate from the @xmath4-th bin due to collisions is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the rate at which individual objects of size @xmath5 undergo catastrophic collisions .    a catastrophic collision is defined as one in which the mass of the largest remnant after the collision has less than half of the mass of the original object .",
    "this definition is used for our _ typical _ collision , not because we believe that catastrophic collisions are the only important collisions  indeed it has been shown that cratering collisions with much lower energy may also result in significant mass loss ( e.g. , kobayashi & tanaka 2010 )  but because we expect the overall mass loss rate ( i.e. , including both catastrophic and cratering collisions ) for all bins to scale with the rate of catastrophic collisions within them , at least for distributions that are infinite in extent .",
    "it may be that mass loss in fact scales with the rate of collisions in which the largest remnant has slightly more or less than 50% the mass of the original object .",
    "the catastrophic collision rate for a planetesimal of size @xmath5 can be determined using the particle - in - a - box approach and integrating over the size distribution of impactors that have sufficient specific incident energy ( @xmath33 ) to cause a catastrophic collision , which is defined as the dispersal threshold @xmath34 . for collisions that occur at relative velocity @xmath35 the smallest impactors that cause catastrophic destruction",
    "are those of size @xmath36 , where @xmath37 which we denote in the following equation as those with an index @xmath38 .",
    "thus the collision rate , both in its discrete and continuous forms , is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is particle density , @xmath41 is the intrinsic collision probability used by other authors ( e.g. , wetherill 1967 ) between particles @xmath14 and @xmath4 that is equal to @xmath42 for all particle sizes for applications in this paper , and @xmath43 is the volume through which the planetesimals are moving , @xmath44 is the number of planetesimals in the size distribution per unit diameter , and the gravitational focussing factor has been neglected for this calculation .",
    "the continuous form of the collision rate ( equation  [ eq : rkc2 ] ) can be used to determine the steady state size distribution analytically , for certain assumptions . by integrating the mass distribution @xmath45 over the bin",
    "we find that for small @xmath8 @xmath46 and so @xmath47 further assuming that @xmath48 and that @xmath49 and @xmath50 so that collisions close to the catastrophic collision threshold dominate the rate ( i.e. , so we can take only the term with @xmath51 in the integral and ignore the upper limit ) , gives @xmath52 if @xmath53 then we find that @xmath54 and for this to be independent of size as required for steady state ( equation  [ eq : ss2 ] ) @xmath55 this reduces to the canonical @xmath56 distribution for the situation where strength is independent of size ( dohnanyi 1969 ; tanaka et al .",
    "1996 ) , and replicates the distribution found analytically by other authors when strength depends on size ( obrien & greenberg 2003 ; lhne 2008 ; lhne et al . 2008 ; heng & tremaine 2009 ; birnstiel et al .",
    "2011 ; belyaev & rafikov 2011 ) .",
    "the discrete form of the collision rate ( equation  [ eq : rkc1 ] ) can also be used to determine the steady state size distribution numerically .",
    "if we impose a constant mass loss rate per logarithmic bin , as argued to be the case in  [ ss : mk ] , then we can rearrange equation  ( [ eq : mdotk - c ] ) and combine with equation  ( [ eq : ss2 ] ) to get @xmath57 this can be solved iteratively , and converges quickly to find the steady state distribution .",
    "the shape of the resulting distribution is independent of the total mass in the distribution , because multiplying the whole distribution @xmath30 by @xmath58 would result in the mass loss in the @xmath4-th bin @xmath59 and the mass gain @xmath60 both increasing by @xmath61 .",
    "application of this method is discussed in ",
    "[ sss : num1appl ] .",
    "alternatively we can relax the assumption of equation  ( [ eq : ss2 ] ) and apply a similar method more directly to equation  ( [ eq : ss1 ] ) , and so equate mass loss with mass gain in each bin by iterating @xmath62 in this case , by the arguments of  [ ss : mk ] , we would expect to end up with a solution for which @xmath63 is approximately constant ( at least for most particle sizes ) .    to implement this method",
    "requires the redistribution function @xmath64 to be defined ( see  [ ss : redistrib ] ) . without further constraints",
    "this method would converge to a distribution with zero mass .",
    "this is because the lack of larger particles means that the mass input rate to the top bin is zero , which can only be balanced by having zero mass there ; if that is the case then the mass input to the bin below this is zero , and so on .",
    "this issue can be remedied by constraining the largest bin(s ) to have either a fixed mass distribution , or a fixed mass input rate ( e.g. , by adding @xmath65 to @xmath63 ) .",

    "[ s : pr ] .      where it is necessary in this paper",
    ", we assume that the fragments from the destruction of objects of size @xmath5 follow the power law of equation  ( [ eq : nd ] ) , with parameters identified by subscript @xmath67 , from sizes of @xmath68 down to infinitesimally small particles . unless otherwise stated we consider @xmath69 ( i.e. , the largest objects have half the mass of the original ) , which corresponds to catastrophic collisions dominating the redistribution of mass . in this paper",
    "we also consider a function with @xmath70 , which corresponds to cratering collisions dominating mass redistribution .",
    "for @xmath71 we also include a small but finite fraction of mass in particles in the @xmath68 to @xmath5 size range using a steep power law ( with @xmath72 ) when @xmath73 . ] .",
    "the slope is always assumed to have @xmath74 so that the mass in fragments is weighted toward large objects .",
    "these assumptions mean that the fractional mass distribution of these fragments is @xmath75 across the appropriate range .",
    "integrating over the size range of bin @xmath76 , and assuming @xmath9 , gives @xmath77    although it is the redistribution function @xmath78 that is employed throughout this paper , it is worth considering a more general form of the redistribution function , since the techniques presented herein may also applicable in this instance .",
    "most numerical models of collisional evolution define the redistribution function as @xmath79 , the fraction of mass leaving the @xmath14-th bin from collisions with the @xmath80-th bin that goes into the @xmath4-th bin .",
    "in general such redistribution functions also have some form of scale independence , and can , e.g. , be written as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the index of the size that causes catastrophic destruction of objects of size @xmath83 .",
    "this is because a collision with the @xmath82-th bin ends up , by definition , with a largest remnant that has half the mass of the original , and collisions with other bins end up with largest remnants that scale as a function of the ratio @xmath84 , and so have redistribution functions that only depend on @xmath85 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath81 is the true redistribution function , then we have implicitly averaged over @xmath80 , weighted by the frequency of such collisions , to get @xmath78 as the redistribution of mass in a _ typical _ collision .",
    "thus we can write @xmath86 this illustrates that the @xmath78 redistribution function may not be scale independent , even if @xmath87 is , because it includes information about the size distribution ( see also belyaev & rafikov 2011 ) .",
    "in particular , it may be expected to be different at locations where there are sharp transitions in the size distribution .",
    "these issues may also contribute to the timescale of mass loss in a _",
    "typical _ collision being different to the timescale for catastrophic collisions , as discussed in ",
    "[ ss : ststsizedist ] .",
    "nevertheless , we retain the @xmath78 redistribution function for this paper , since it is expected to be valid over most of the size distribution , and is shown in later sections to be in agreement with more detailed models .      as reported by several authors studying collision outcomes ( e.g. , durda et al . 1998",
    "; benz & asphaug 1999 ) , the size dependence of the dispersal threshold can be expressed as @xmath88 where the subscripts @xmath89 and @xmath90 refer to contributions from the planetesimal s material strength and from its self - gravity , respectively , and @xmath89 and @xmath90 are positive .",
    "the weakest planetesimals then have size @xmath91 e.g. , for planetesimals made of basalt impacting at 3 km s@xmath92 ( benz & asphaug 1999 ) , reasonable values are @xmath93 j kg@xmath92 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 j kg@xmath92 , @xmath96 , for which @xmath97 km .",
    "here we adopt slightly different values of @xmath98 j kg@xmath92 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 j kg@xmath92 , @xmath101 , to allow comparison with the results of lhne et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in later sections .",
    "a reasonable approximation is that the only contribution to @xmath102 is from the strength component for @xmath103 ( the strength regime ) and from the gravity component for @xmath104 ( the gravity regime ) .",
    "application of the analysis of  [ sss : analyt ] then suggests that the size distribution should have two phases described by power laws ( equation  [ eq : nd ] ) with @xmath105 in the strength regime and @xmath106 given by equation  ( [ eq : alpha ] ) in the gravity regime .",
    "power law indices in this paper , like @xmath107 , that refer to equation  ( [ eq : nd ] ) are summarised in table  [ tab : tab2 ] , along with a summary of diameters that define where these apply . for the dispersal law assumed here , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    ".summary of ( some of ) the parameters used in the paper : power law indices that refer to equation  ( [ eq : nd ] ) , and diameters .",
    "diameters ( e.g. , @xmath110 ) also have corresponding indices ( e.g. , @xmath111 ) to denote bin number . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : tab1 ]    the evolution of planetesimal belts with different initial parameters would be expected to show similar behaviour",
    ". however , there would be quantitative differences .",
    "for example , the ages of the transitions between the stages would depend on the initial parameters , since they correspond ( e.g. , table  [ tab : tab2 ] ) to the collisional lifetime of objects of size @xmath112 ( transition i - ii ) , and of size @xmath113 ( transition ii - iii ) , and the age at which the collisional lifetime of objects of size @xmath114 is equal to their p - r drag lifetime ( transition iii - iv ) .",
    "the fall - off of dust mass and area with age during stage ii also depends on the primordial size distribution and on the dispersal law in the gravity regime ( see equation  43 of lhne et al .",
    "2008 ) , and the dust mass in stage iv depends on the dispersal law in the strength regime and the redistribution function ( equation  [ eq : mksdpr ] ) .",
    "there may also be qualitative differences .",
    "for example , if the primordial distribution contained no particles in the gravity regime , i.e. , if @xmath115 , then there could be no `` g '' phase in the size distribution , and stage ii would be skipped .",
    "similarly , if the primordial distribution was made up of different power laws , then there would be different phases associated with the timescale for collisional equilibrium to reach the transitions between the primordial power laws .",
    "and it was already noted that it may be possible for p - r drag to become important during stage ii in which case an evolutionary stage involving the 4 phases `` pr - s - g - p '' would be reached .",
    "the method of  [ s : pr ] for considering the effect of p - r drag on the steady state size distribution of planetesimal belts undergoing a collisional cascade can be applied to other loss processes in a similar manner . in particular ,",
    "if the loss process is described by @xmath116 then its effect on the steady state size distribution can be determined numerically by extending method 2 (  [ sss : method2 ] ) to solve @xmath117 here we consider several loss processes , and their qualitative effect on the size distribution ( and its evolution ) , but defer a detailed treatment to later work .",
    "treatment of other loss processes such as yarkovsky forces and gas drag are also possible within this framework , as are erosive loss processes , such as sublimation and sputtering , by invoking the gain term @xmath118 in equation  ( [ eq : mdotk ] ) ( since loss from one size bin results in gain into another )",
    ". however , such considerations are again beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "consider the action of a loss process that can be defined by equation  ( [ eq : mkl ] ) with @xmath119 which is a generalisation of loss by p - r drag for which @xmath120 .",
    "as long as @xmath121 is large enough , the analytical treatment is identical to that for p - r drag , in that there is a transition at the size @xmath122 for which @xmath123 for @xmath124 the removal of particles is dominated by the loss process , while for @xmath125 removal is dominated by collisions .",
    "a consideration of the analogous figure  [ fig : pr]b shows that _ large enough _ here means @xmath126 where @xmath127 is determined from a comparison of the slope in the loss regime ( equation  [ eq : rkl ] ) with that in the collisional regime ( equation  [ eq : rckcoll ] ) . assuming the transition occurs in the strength regime ( i.e. , @xmath128 ) , equation  ( [ eq : alphaa ] ) means that @xmath129 which for @xmath99 means @xmath130 .",
    "thus the evolution is qualitatively similar , and the size distribution in the loss regime is still indicative of the redistribution function , except that the index is now @xmath131 the mass loss from the belt by loss processes is @xmath132 for @xmath125 , but is still @xmath133 for @xmath124 . assuming the largest particles are in collisional equilibrium",
    "so that particles in the collisional regime are being depleted @xmath134 , then by equating the rate of collisional loss @xmath135 with the rate from loss processes ( equation  [ eq : rkl ] ) , we find that the transition size follows @xmath136 for similar reasoning to that used to derive equation  ( [ eq : mksdpr ] ) , this means that the mass in small particles below the transition evolves @xmath137      however , if @xmath138 , then it is not small particles that are most affected by loss processes , but particles above @xmath122 .",
    "this is the situation for most dynamical loss processes for which loss rates are independent of size and so @xmath139 .",
    "the effect on the size distribution is more complicated in this case .",
    "for example , consider the belt of figure  [ fig : lohneii-0.3 ] that has evolved to @xmath140gyr without dynamical mass loss , but then undergoes impulsive and significant dynamical depletion by a factor @xmath141 .",
    "this would cause the size distribution to be retained , but to drop at all sizes by the same fraction .",
    "this would mean that additional evolutionary time would be needed for the smallest objects in the primordial distribution ( @xmath142 km in diameter ) to come to collisional equilibrium and continue to evolve . in the meantime the size distribution in the portion that was originally in steady state ( @xmath143 km ) would be retained since the depletion would not have affected the balance of mass gain or loss from such bins .",
    "this example illustrates two ways in which dynamical depletion can affect the size distribution of what appears to be primordial at late times : some parts of the distribution may represent a scaled down version of the original primordial distribution , whereas others may represent the steady state distribution attained during an earlier high mass phase of evolution , even though their collisional lifetime is longer than the current system age .",
    "this point was recognised by bottke et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who showed how dynamical depletion can be modelled by considering collisional evolution that takes place over timescales longer than the system age .",
    "this is in agreement with our analysis , since we expect the size distribution of the above example following the depletion to look like that expected for a primordial distribution that is scaled down by @xmath141 then evolved for a time @xmath144 times longer than the current system age . as noted by bottke et al .",
    ", it is not possible to infer @xmath141 from the current distribution ( of the asteroid belt in their application ) , i.e. , we can not determine if the original distribution was very massive and short - lived , or less massive and longer - lived .",
    "however , it is possible to model the evolution of the size distribution for depletion by a known amount @xmath141 at a known time @xmath145 .",
    "the prescription for the effect radiation forces in the preceding sections is an approximation of the true physics .",
    "for example , the truncation of the size distribution by radiation pressure , which occurs for particles with @xmath146 is implemented by simply not including such bins in the analysis .",
    "however , a more realistic approach would be to include radiation pressure as a loss process with an associated ( short , i.e. , less than orbital ) timescale for bins below @xmath114 .",
    "thus it would be possible to account for the possibility that the blow - out population collides with bound grains ( krivov et al .",
    "2000 ) , and for a gradual rather than sharp truncation due to a finite eccentricity of the parent particles ( which means that @xmath147 particles can remain bound ) and/or due to a range of particle properties .",
    "it was already noted that the increase in eccentricity for particles close to @xmath114 is not accounted for in this model , but again this could be incorporated using an appropriately modified intrinsic collision probability @xmath41 in equation  ( [ eq : rkc1 ] ) ( e.g. , krivov et al .",
    "2005 ; wyatt et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "another approximation is the inverse linear dependence of the p - r drag loss rate on particle size .",
    "in fact @xmath148 , and although @xmath149 for large black body particles , this function peaks at 0.1 - 1 @xmath2 m particles ( i.e. , at particle sizes that are comparable to the dominant wavelength of stellar radiation ) , turning over for smaller particles and tending to @xmath150 independent of size for particles @xmath151 @xmath2 m ( e.g. , gustafson 1994 ) . for particles around high luminosity stars",
    "this turnover is inconsequential , since it occurs at sizes below @xmath114 .",
    "however , for low luminosity stars it is so important that there may be no particles that can be removed by radiation pressure , i.e. , @xmath152 for all particle sizes ( e.g. , sheret et al .",
    "the consequence of this is that , in the absence of other loss processes , p - r drag is the only removal mechanism for dust from the cascade , and so it is important to consider the effect of the turnover in @xmath150 vs @xmath153 on the steady state size distribution .",
    "a reconsideration of equation  ( [ eq : mksprf ] ) shows that the size distribution in this regime should really be @xmath154 this goes some way to explaining the shape of the size distribution seen in fig .  4 of reidemeister et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , since equation  ( [ eq : mkspr4 ] ) would predict a distribution of drag dominated particles that is fairly flat in the 0.04 - 10 @xmath2 m size range with a dip at @xmath155 @xmath2 m .",
    "although the discussion has focussed on radiation forces , it is notable that p - r drag only becomes important for debris disks that are so low in density that they are no longer detectable with current instrumentation ( dominik & decin 2003 ; wyatt 2005 ) .",
    "however , stellar wind forces act in exactly the same way as radiation forces . their pressure component ( which is analogous to radiation pressure ) can usually be ignored , but their drag component ( which is analogous to p - r drag ) can significantly exceed p - r forces ( e.g. , plavchan et al .",

    "thus stellar wind drag can be considered as an enhanced form of p - r drag using the same analysis but with a constant @xmath156 in equation  ( [ eq : rpr ] ) that means its effect on the size distribution can become apparent at much younger evolutionary ages ( i.e. , for much higher , and potentially detectable , disc masses ) than its radiation counterpart . as per the discussion of  [ ss : realbeta ] , it may also be the dominant loss mechanism for the belts of low luminosity stars .",
    "no change in the qualitative picture of disc evolution presented in ",
    "[ ss : sumevol ] is necessary , except to note that the turnover in the size distribution may become apparent in earlier evolutionary phases ( e.g. , in phase ii as already noted in ",
    "[ ss : sumevol ] ) .",
    "in this paper we presented a new scheme for determining the shape of the size distribution , and its evolution , for collisional cascades of planetesimals undergoing destructive collisions and loss processes like poynting - robertson drag .",
    "this scheme , outlined in  [ s : col ] , considers mass gain and loss in different size bins , and treats the steady state portion of the cascade by solving for the assumption that @xmath157 , and assumes that larger objects retain their primordial distribution .",
    "many results can be obtained analytically , providing insight into the origin of the shape of the size distribution .",
    "for example , for particles in the steady state collisional regime this prescription was shown to lead to mass loss rate being independent of size in logarithmic size bins ; thus the steady state size distribution is independent of mass gain into the bins in this regime .",
    "however , perhaps most notably this scheme provides an efficient and readily implemented numerical method for calculating the size distribution .",
    "although the scheme as presented assumes a simple scale independent redistribution function that defines the average mass distribution of fragments produced in collisional destruction of objects of a given size , and considers only the size distribution in one radial bin , it may be expanded to more complex redistribution functions , and to include a radial dimension ( or to include dimensions of orbital elements ) .",
    "our scheme , and its application to consider the evolution of the size distribution in the collision - dominated regime , was shown to reproduce qualitatively all of the features found by more detailed ( and computationally more time - consuming ) models that step size distributions forward in time .",
    "such features in the size distribution include ripples above the radiation pressure blow - out limit , the change in slope at the transition from strength to gravity regime , the ripple above this transition , and the transition to primordial regime . for evolution ,",
    "the scheme reproduces the initially slow fall - off of dust mass with time @xmath158 followed by steeper decline @xmath134 , as well as an evolution of total disk mass that is much flatter in the initial phases but also tends to @xmath134 at late ages .",
    "one of the main purposes of the paper was to consider the effect of loss processes on the steady state size distribution , which was done in detail for p - r drag in ",
    "[ s : pr ] .",
    "this was found , both analytically and confirmed numerically , to cause a turnover at small sizes to a size distribution that is set by the redistribution function .",
    "this means that information about the redistribution function may be recovered by measuring the size distribution of particles undergoing loss by p - r drag .",
    "this was illustrated by comparison with the size distribution of particles accreted by the earth , though it was noted that further work on the collisional evolution of material inside the source belt and on the accretion efficiency as a function of particle size would be needed before definitive conclusions on the redistribution function could be reached .",
    "the evolution of the size distribution when p - r drag is included is summarised in  [ ss : sumevol ] and table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "notably it is found that although cross - sectional area drops with age @xmath0 in the pr - dominated regime , dust mass falls @xmath1 , underlining the importance of understanding which particle sizes contribute to an observation when considering how disk detectability evolves .",
    "other loss processes are readily incorporated into this scheme . in  [ s : gen ] , we also discussed loss rates that can be defined by a power law in particle size , including dynamical depletion , a more realistic prescription for radiation loss rates that are not simply inversely proportional to paticle size , and stellar wind drag .",
    "steep power law loss rates lead to size distributions and evolutions that are directly analogous to p - r drag ( but with modified exponents ) , but loss rates that are less biased to small particles are harder to treat",
    ". however , the application to dynamical depletion agrees with the results in the literature .",
    "the way in which p - r drag becomes independent of size for the smallest particles causes a ripple and flattening of this distribution at such sizes in the p - r drag regime .",
    "the application to stellar wind drag results in distributions and evolutions that are the same as those for p - r drag , but if this effect becomes important at all , it does so at higher disc masses meaning that it has the potential to be relevant for disks that are detectable with current technology .",
    "there are now several surveys for debris disks that show how disk brightness drops with age ( see review in wyatt 2008 ) , and further surveys are currently underway ( e.g. , matthews et al . 2010 ) .",
    "interpretation of these surveys requires efficient schemes so that populations of large numbers of debris disks can be modelled ( e.g. , wyatt et al .",
    "2007b ; lhne",
    "as such surveys push to lower disk masses , it is also important to be able to incorporate consideration of loss processes .",
    "the results presented here suggest that when disks drop to a level at which p - r drag becomes important , which is close to the limit of detectability with spitzer ( see fig . 4 of wyatt et al .",
    "2007a ) , their brightness begins to drop rapidly , as fast as @xmath1 .",
    "such a fast fall off is also expected for disks affected by stellar wind drag , which may occur for disks well above the current detectability threshold . in short",
    ", this paper provides an efficient model with which to interpret observations of the debris disks of nearby stars , and their evolution , including in regimes where loss processes are important for small ( or large ) particles .",
    "the authors are grateful to the isaac newton institute for mathematical sciences in cambridge , where the initial work on this paper was carried out during the dynamics of discs and planets research programme , and to torsten lhne for discussions on his ace simulations .",
    "we are also grateful to the reviewers for their careful reading of the manuscript and to alexander krivov for providing the results of the ace simulation presented in figure 2 .",
