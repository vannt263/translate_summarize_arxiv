    "here we describe briefly the main ideas in the model developed in bjl09 for magnetic field amplification . for further details and argumentations",
    "the reader is referred to the original paper .",
    "the fluid elements passing through the precursor have density inhomogeneities .",
    "as already mentioned , some level of density inhomogeneity in astrophysical fluids is naturally generated by the combination of compressible turbulence , gravity and cooling @xcite .",
    "when this inhomogeneous plasma flows into the precursor with speed @xmath5 ( the shock front velocity in the reference frame of the upstream flow ) , it is decelerated by the cr pressure gradient down to a velocity @xmath6 at the shock front .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : solenoidal ] .",
    "the interaction between the fluid and the cr pressure creates perturbations of velocity @xmath7 , as a consequence of the differences between the ballistic velocity that highest density regions have and the full deceleration suffered by the lowest density regions .",
    "the resulting velocity field is partially solenoidal due to the shear caused by the different velocities acquired by the light and dense parts of the gas .",
    "the amount of solenoidal velocity can be parametrized as @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "the characteristic scale of the solenoidal perturbations @xmath10 is , for the case of supersonic ism , the distance between slow sub - shocks ( see section  [ sec : ism ] ) , which is smaller than the turbulence outer scale @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath10 can be of the order of parsecs ( see discussion in the next subsection ) .",
    "these solenoidal velocities develop a turbulent cascade , which amplify the weak magnetic magnetic field embedded in the precursor through the turbulent small - scale dynamo ( ssd ) .",
    "the ssd has three main stages : the kinematic stage during which magnetic energy grows exponentially ; the linear stage and a saturation stage ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the kinematic stage in astrophysical problems is not relevant because its saturation time - scale is very short compared to astrophysical time - scales .",
    "therefore , it is always assumed that the kinematic dynamo is saturated and the dynamo is in the linear stage . in this stage",
    "the magnetic energy increases linearly with time , i.e. , @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the energy transfer rate of the turbulence and @xmath14 can be thought as the efficiency of the ssd .",
    "the energy transfer rate can be estimated as @xmath15 .    at some time the magnetic field reaches equipartition with the turbulent velocity field for motions at the scale @xmath16 .",
    "this scale grows with time . on scales smaller than @xmath16",
    "magnetic and velocity perturbations form a mhd turbulent cascade with a steep spectrum . on scales larger than @xmath16",
    ", the magnetic field has a shallow spectrum and the velocity has a kolmogorov spectrum .    when @xmath16 approaches @xmath10 , the ssd enters the saturation stage in which the magnetic field grows more slowly than in the previous linear stage .",
    "however , in the physical scenario considered here , the saturation stage is never reached , since limited time is available for field amplification .",
    "the mechanism efficiency depends on the relative amplitude of the initial density perturbations , i.e. @xmath17 .",
    "when @xmath17 @xmath2 1 , the mechanism is expected to be more efficient .",
    "even when the ratio @xmath17 is initially small , the initial density perturbations could be enhanced in the precursor up to the order of unity by different mechanisms . under some conditions",
    "rayleigh - taylor - like instabilities can strongly enhance turbulence in the cr precursor .",
    "many possible sources of turbulence in the ism exist operating at different scales and injecting different powers .",
    "the ism is classified in phases , according to the temperature and state of the hydrogen , of which it is almost fully composed .",
    "cold regions in which hydrogen is in molecular form include dark clouds and molecular clouds , and in which hydrogen is atomic include cold neutral medium , photo - dissociation regions , reflection nebula , etc .",
    "the warm ism includes warm neutral medium of atomic hydrogen and ionized regions such as the so - called warm ionized medium , and h ii regions .",
    "the hot ism includes coronal gas , hot ionized medium , etc .",
    "( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the physical conditions of the ism phases , including the degree of magnetization , stablish the sonic and alfvnic regime of the turbulence .",
    "the turbulence in hot and warm ism is usually subsonic or trans - sonic with respect to the ambient turbulent motions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a generic property of the cold ism is cooling which keeps temperatures low , making ism turbulence highly compressive .",
    "thus the mach numbers increase in cold hi ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in dense regions , observations",
    "reveal that turbulence in molecular clouds and star forming regions can be highly supersonic ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in general ,",
    "the warm ism typical observed mach numbers are between 1 and 10 .",
    "the cold and dense ism has mach numbers between 10 and 50 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in order to study the magnetic field amplification on the shock precursor we perform mhd simulations of a supersonic flow in the shock referential frame .",
    "we employ the pluto code @xcite , a conservative shock - capturing code , for solving the dimensionless ideal mhd equations :    @xmath18 & = & \\mathbf{f}_{\\rm cr}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{b}}{\\partial t } - \\mathbf{\\nabla}\\times ( \\mathbf{v}\\times \\mathbf{b } ) & = & 0 , \\label{b_eqn } \\\\",
    "\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{b } & = & 0 \\label{divb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is the density , @xmath20 is the velocity , @xmath21 is the thermal pressure , @xmath22 is the magnetic field , @xmath23 the total energy density ( excluding the cr energy ) , @xmath24 is the adiabatic index , and @xmath25 is the force per volume due to the cr pressure gradient ( see below ) .",
    "we use the third order runge - kutta scheme for time evolution , and the fluxes are calculated employing the hll solver and parabolic interpolation .",
    "the magnetic divergence is controlled using a cleaning divergence scheme .",
    "the mhd equations are solved in a three - dimensional cartesian box discretized by a uniform grid .    the cr pressure is directly related to the flow kinetic energy available in the pre - shock ( at the shock referential ) . in our simulations",
    "the shock front is considered flat and localized at the right boundary of the computational domain .",
    "we model the force due to the cr pressure @xmath25 as decreasing exponentially with the distance from the shock position @xmath26 , through the equation :    @xmath27    here @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the averages in the @xmath30-plane of the @xmath31-component of the momentum and of the @xmath31-component of the velocity respectively ; @xmath32 is an efficiency parameter smaller than 1 . following @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we adopt @xmath33 .",
    "the cr diffusion scale @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the cr diffusion coefficient in the preshock region and @xmath36 is the preshock flow velocity , is considered constant in the entire domain and in time .",
    "the computational domain , in the direction parallel to the shock propagation ( @xmath31-direction ) , has length @xmath37 .",
    "we apply the physical constraint that the force produced by the cr pressure is halted if the total mach number  '' refers to the value of the mach number of the pre - shock flow at infinity ( far from the shock ) ; in the simulations it is the physical value at the inflow boundary . ]",
    "@xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the local alfvn velocity , becomes less than unity close to the shock ( although this condition is never fulfilled in our simulations ) .",
    "it should be remarked that we do not use explicit viscosity and/or resistivity in our calculations in order to maximize the reynolds and magnetic reynolds numbers , which are very high in astrophysical flows  .",
    "we do not include heat conduction and/or cooling in our simulations .",
    "the domain is initially filled by a density field @xmath19 composed by a uniform component plus an inhomogeneous , `` turbulent '' one : @xmath40 , with @xmath41 ( in code units ) , where the brackets @xmath42 denote a spatial average over the domain .",
    "the initial pressure is uniform and given by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 ( in code units ) is approximately the initial average sound speed , and we use the adiabatic index @xmath45 in all our simulations .",
    "the initial flow has a uniform velocity @xmath46 in the @xmath31-direction .",
    "the initial magnetic field is uniform in the @xmath47 direction , i.e. a perpendicular shock , with @xmath48 .",
    "we define the initial sonic mach number and alfvnic mach number in the preshock respectively as @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , through this study we use @xmath51 and @xmath52 , unless stated otherwise .",
    "we parametrize the `` turbulent '' density fluctuations @xmath53 used in the initial condition by two dimensionless quantities : the ratio between the typical length of the density structures and the cr diffusion scale @xmath54 , and the relative amplitude of these density fluctuations @xmath55 ( the density contrast ) .",
    "table  [ tab : amodels ] shows the parameters of the models presented in this work .",
    "the initial density fluctuation fields are calculated in different ways : for models a , a spectrum of plane waves with random phases is imposed ( synthetic structures ) , and for models b , the density field is taken from a snapshot of mhd turbulence simulations .",
    "these two different initial conditions are detailed below .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the comparison between the power spectrum of the solenoidal velocity and of the magnetic field shows that , for all the parameters considered in this work , the resulting amplification of the magnetic field close to the shock is far from equipartition with the kinetic energy available from the solenoidal velocity field , even for the smaller scales solved in our simulations ( figure  [ fig - ps1 ] ) .",
    "the evolution of each power spectrum ( solenoidal velocity and magnetic field ) along the distance inside the precursor is shown for model ai in figure  [ fig : ai - ps_evol ] .",
    "it can be seen that the velocity power is increasing inside the precursor at approximately the same rate for all the wavenumbers .",
    "c c    the role of the potential ( compressible ) component of the velocity field in the turbulent amplification of the magnetic field is not clear , as the dynamo studies usually consider the incompressible limit of the mhd equations . despite of this , the solenoidal velocity fluctuations dominate over the compressible ones in the turbulence generated ( figure  [ fig : decos ] ) .",
    "additionally , the total velocity fluctuations achieves only a few percent of the upstream flow velocity @xmath36 , and its evolution is shown here to depend strongly on the initial density contrast , as well as on the density structures size ( figure  [ fig : decos ] ) .",
    "the saturation values are in the range @xmath56 for the models we present , and are higher for the highest values of the initial density contrast and of the density structures size .",
    "the scales in which the cr pressure induces turbulence are shown to be concentrated in the typical scale of the density fluctuations , as expected from the bjl09 theory , at least while the density field spectrum is not modified by the precursor turbulence itself .",
    "figure  [ fig : aiii - ps_evol ] compares the power spectrum of the density and velocity field in different @xmath30-planes inside the precursor for model aiii .",
    "the peaks of both power spectrum are approximately at the same wavenumbers , going to larger scales along @xmath31 .",
    "c c    therefore , it is clear that turbulence has not enough time to fully develop before the material reaches the shock , in the sense that the turnover time of the largest eddies inside the precursor is larger or comparable to the time it takes for the material to cross the precursor ( however this time is not fixed , as the turbulent velocity increases along the precursor ) .    it could be thought that reducing the density structures size could give more time to the turbulence cascade to develop , increasing the efficiency of the small - scale dynamo .",
    "in fact , for model aiii the power spectrum of the magnetic field is closer to the solenoidal velocity field at the smaller scales , although it happens already for scales where the numerical dissipation is important ; therefore , we can not exclude the possibility that this would be different for different grid resolutions ( or different numerical dissipations ) .",
    "however , our model aiii show that the turbulent velocity increases more slowly and saturates at lower values in the precursor when comparing with model ai ( see figure  [ fig : decos ] ) , at the same time that the maintenance of the density structures is degraded , despite that the turbulent heating of the gas along the precursor decays , increasing its compressibility .",
    "figure  [ fig : csnd_profile ] shows the comparison of the sound speed profiles between the models studied .",
    "+    this result shows that the injection of turbulent energy in the system by the cr pressure is comparatively larger when the density structures have larger sizes .",
    "figure  [ fig : ekin_v - yz ] compares the profile of `` partial '' kinetic energy between models , calculated taking into account only the components @xmath47 and @xmath57 of the velocity field .",
    "+    therefore , we can conclude that the magnetic energy amplification is larger for larger values of the initial density contrast and larger @xmath58 .",
    "however , this efficiency can not grow indefinitely , because the sound speed of the gas in the precursor increases as well , decreasing the compressibility of the gas ( and consequently the maintenance of the density structures ) and the effective mach number of the shock , reducing the efficiency of the cr acceleration in the shock ( not considered in our formulation ) .",
    "the fact that the magnetic energy amplification is less efficient as smaller the values of the injection scale @xmath59 are can be understood in terms of the mixing time of turbulence @xmath60 and the generation time @xmath61 of the turbulence - induced density structures .",
    "the former can be estimated as @xmath60 @xmath2 @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the eddy diffusivity , that can be estimated as @xmath64 , then @xmath60 @xmath2 @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath61 can be estimated as @xmath66 . because @xmath67 then @xmath68 . for smaller values of @xmath59",
    ", this condition saturates sooner , reducing the magnetic field amplification efficiency .",
    "turbulent heating is not responsible of saturating the density structures as can initially be thought .",
    "the fact that a considerable part of the magnetic energy generated occurs at the smallest scales of the simulations makes the numerical resolution important for the results .",
    "in fact , not only the numerical dissipation of the magnetic field but also the numerical dissipation of the velocity ( and also density ) structures in these small scales cause a reduction of the magnetic energy amplification .",
    "the model hai presents a faster growth rate of vorticity with distance , compared to model ai ; but the former presents a saturation value while the last increases continuously until the shock position ( see figure  [ fig : omg - a1 ] ) .",
    "the final magnetic energy density for model hai is approximately twice the value for the model ai ( @xmath69 for model hai and @xmath70 for model ai , according to figure  [ fig : rho - rms ] ) .",
    "however , the profiles for the fluctuations of the solenoidal and potential velocity , and for the density , do not differ much between them , as shown in figure  [ fig : decos ] , which have the values dominated by the fluctuations at the larger scales ( at the scales @xmath71 ) .",
    "the power spectrum of the magnetic field shows the larger power for model hai at the smaller scales ( see figure  [ fig - ps1 ] ) .",
    "these results show that the magnetic energy amplification obtained in the present simulations can be underestimated , and should be considered as a lower limit .",
    "the comparison between the results from models a and b shows that the statistical details of the density fluctuations have little influence on the final magnetic field amplification . in the setup employed in this study ,",
    "the density structures inflowing in the precursor lose their initial characteristics in a short distance , being dominated by the density structures induced by the compressional turbulence . in order to illustrate this point ,",
    "figure  [ fig : dens_ab_evol ] compares the evolution of the density spectrum along the precursor for models aii and bii , which have similar initial values of @xmath72 and @xmath58 .",
    "we see that after @xmath73 both spectrum present similar shapes .",
    "c c    however , it should be observed that the initial density spectrum of models a and b differ on scales larger than @xmath59 , with more power in models b. the same occurs for the magnetic field spectrum close to the shock position , as can be seen comparing the models in figure  [ fig - ps1 ] .",
    "models with similar initial values of @xmath72 and @xmath58 but slightly different spectral slope ( models ai and bi , aii and bii ) present similar values of magnetic field amplification ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rho - rms ] ) .",
    "we ran an additional model using the same parameters as model ai ( see table  [ tab : amodels ] ) , but with @xmath74 .",
    "the resulting cr pressure is increased approximately by a factor @xmath2 16 , and consequently the turbulent energy is greater in this system .",
    "however , there is no enough time for the magnetic field to grow further , and the final magnetic field is almost the same as in the original case with @xmath51 .    due to our self - regulated formulation",
    ", we do not expect great differences in the magnetic field amplification with the shock mach number ( we are not considering the dependences that the particle acceleration efficiency might have with @xmath75 ) ; although a very different value might produce differences in the magnetic field amplification .",
    "however we are interested in strong non - relativistic galactic shocks , in which the mach numbers do not differ significantly .",
    "the limited domain size in the direction parallel to the shock propagation might reduce the magnetic field amplification .",
    "we considered the cr pressure acting only inside the scale @xmath76 , which means that the effects of the force at the distances where it decayed by a factor smaller than @xmath77 is neglected . in order to test this we made a run with the initial conditions given by model ai but doubling the box dimension in the @xmath31-direction , i.e. @xmath78 , and resolution @xmath79 .",
    "the final magnetic field in this case is approximately twice the value obtain for model ai ( not shown ) .",
    "less important , if the computational box in the perpendicular directions ( @xmath47 and @xmath57 ) were larger , some small amplitude density fluctuations with scales larger than @xmath59 could develop , leading to additional magnetic field amplification .    also the presence of cooling could increase the generation of higher density fluctuations .",
    "our models with higher initial density contrast have also higher magnetic field amplifications . however , the presence of cooling was considered in @xcite ( see next section ) , and they did not detected a substantial increase on the magnetic energy amplification .    as mentioned in section  [ sec : data ] , we do not consider the turbulent fluctuations of velocity and magnetic field in the initial conditions of models b ; this can be justified taking into account that the real ism density structures are formed in the presence of cooling ; therefore the density fluctuations are not totally dependent on the presence of magneto - acoustic modes , and can be present even after the decays of velocity and magnetic turbulence fluctuations ( entropy modes ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the velocity and magnetic fluctuations present from the mhd turbulence simulations have larger amplitudes than those generated by the crs pressure .",
    "hence , if an initial turbulent magnetic field component is considered for the initial state ( in the upstream material ) , the magnetic field amplification close to the shock will be lower compared to our results .",
    "finally , we do not consider the cr pressure @xmath80 in the total pressure @xmath21 ( see eqs .",
    "( 3)-(7 ) ) .",
    "adding @xmath80 to the total pressure might lead to a more incompressible plasma , hence the density fluctuations might saturate faster , possibly reducing the magnetic field amplification .",
    "the first numerical study exploring the magnetic field amplification in the shock upstream via mhd turbulence induced by cr shock precursor was presented in @xcite . employing 2d simulations for a shock propagating perpendicular to the initially uniform magnetic field",
    ", they studied the magnetic field profile inside the precursor for different amplitudes of the initial density fluctuations , and also for different values of the initial magnetic field intensity .",
    "they found that the final magnetic energy amplification factor depends little on the amplitude of the initial density fluctuations .",
    "it was interpreted as resulting from non - linear effects of turbulence , which increases the density contrast along the precursor and then reduces the influence of the initial values .",
    "they also found that the magnetic field amplification does not depend on its initial value , as it could be expected if the magnetic energy is far below the equipartition .",
    "later on , @xcite investigated the influence of the initial magnetic field orientation , the presence of cooling , and more importantly , they performed three - dimensional numerical simulations .",
    "they showed that the resulting magnetic field profile in the 3d setup is very similar to that of the 2d one , with a slightly smaller magnetic field amplification in the former case .",
    "the magnetic field power spectrum are clearly different in the 2d and 3d cases as expected : in the 3d setup the magnetic field structures have smaller sizes ; this difference arises because the velocity cascade of 2d turbulence proceed as an inverse cascade ( as in hydrodynamic turbulence ) , 2d turbulence is not appropriate for modelling mhd turbulence .",
    "concerning the initial magnetic field orientation , they found that larger amplification is produced in the perpendicular case .",
    "however , this difference in amplification with the parallel case can be explained , as showed in the paper , to be produced by compression .",
    "finally , they showed that for the density scales they considered ( representative of the ism ) cooling has little impact on their 2d simulations , because the cooling time is longer than the time the gas takes to cross the precursor .",
    "similar to the study in @xcite , the magnetic field amplification in our simulations does not converge ; we also attribute this to the fact that amplification along the precursor is still occurring at scales below the scales that can be resolved in our simulations .",
    "in fact , the solenoidal velocity is also continuously increasing along the precursor , although after passing the middle of the box ( in the @xmath31 direction ) the power spectrum shape remains approximately unchanged until the end of the domain ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : aiii - ps_evol ] ) .",
    "we have no evidences that the small - scale dynamo in any of our simulations enters the linear phase after equipartition is already achieved at some scale .",
    "if the dynamo is still in the exponential growth phase , it can help to explain the similarities between the 2d and 3d amplifications found in @xcite , because the turbulence cascade is still not regulating the amplification of the field in the 3d case.we have inferred that the turn - over time of the turbulence outer scale in our setups is not short compared with the time these eddies remain inside the precursor .",
    "when studying the role of cooling , @xcite focused on their 2d models .",
    "it is expected that in the 3d case , where the forward cascade quickly heats the gas reducing its compressibility and then the generation of density structures , the cooling to have a stronger impact .",
    "another important point is related to the generation of crs in the shock .",
    "the acceleration process is though to be sensitive to the sonic mach number of the shock .",
    "therefore the turbulence heated gas in the precursor also has the effect of reducing the cr pressure , which in turn reduces the magnetic field amplification in the precursor .",
    "however , the influence of the precursor on the shock evolution itself is not considered in our simplified model , which requires a much more involved modelling of the problem .    a difference between our approach and that in @xcite and @xcite is in the model of the cr pressure in the precursor . in our approach ,",
    "the cr pressure is considered to decay exponentially ( instead of linearly ) from the shock front , and consequently the cr force also decays exponentiallyalthough the self - consistent profile of the cr pressure is difficult to calculate  as it depends on the energy of the cr rays considered and their diffusivity which in turn is anisotropic and depends on the physics of the upstream flow ( such as the magnetic fields fluctuations , the velocity profile , etc . )",
    " we just considered the solution for the cr energy in the diffusion approximation for a fixed value of the diffusivity , and without considering the influence of the cr pressure on the upstream flow .",
    "another difference in the cr pressure modeling , and probably the most relevant , is the use of the flow variables close to the shock in order to obtain the ram pressure of the flow at the shock .",
    "the cr force amplitude is updated dynamically in our simulations , accordingly to the kinetic energy of the upstream flow available at the shock .",
    "the previous works considered a fixed force @xmath81 , which can lead to non - physical situations ( no shock ) if the induced turbulence in the precursor increases the sound speed in the gas above the upstream velocity , making the problem ill - posed ; this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - cs - comparison ] , where the fluid velocity versus sound speed profiles are shown for a simulation with a constant cr force .",
    "the plasma reaches temperatures so high that the flow velocity gets lower than @xmath82 ( no shock ) and then no fermi acceleration would be operating .",
    "c    our formulation imposes a more stringent limit on the efficiency of the magnetic field amplification mechanism , which we believe to be more realistic : a stronger force reduces more the pre - shock velocity flow , at the same time more turbulence is generated ; this reduces the upstream flow ram pressure and hence the cr acceleration becomes less efficient , reducing the cr pressure force .",
    "the system is self - regulated . from fig .",
    "[ fig - forces - comparison ] , can be seen that in the case of a constant force used in the previous works the flow ram pressure at the boundary is less than one third the value used @xmath83 for the cr force calculation , that is , the amplitude considered for the cr force is overestimated .",
    "in this work we investigated turbulence - induced magnetic field amplification in shock precursors under the bjl09 model .",
    "we used mhd simulations to quantify the problem , modelling the cr pressure as a function of the flow ram pressure .",
    "we considered models with different density inhomogeneities in the precursor , parametrized the density contrast @xmath55 and by the relative density structures scales @xmath84 .    in agreement",
    "to bjl09 , we have found that :    * the interaction of density fluctuations with the cr precursor produces vorticity .",
    "our calculations show that vorticity is generated at a faster rate for higher density contrast and for smaller density structure scales ; * the solenoidal velocity fluctuations dominate over the compressible ones in the turbulence induced at the precursor .",
    "both components achieve roughly @xmath85 10% of the upstream velocity and their evolution depends strongly on the initial density contrasts and density structures sizes ; * the scales in which the cr pressure induces turbulence in the precursor are close to the scale of the density inhomogeneities .",
    "hence , the injection of turbulent energy in the precursor is larger when the ism density structures have larger sizes .",
    "the final magnetic energy depends strongly on @xmath55 , but it is approximately insensitive to the values of @xmath84 considered here . in our formulation , the amplification factors of the magnetic field due to the gas compression are relatively small ( @xmath86 ) , being most of the magnetic energy growth due to the small - scale dynamo .",
    "the amplified magnetic fields we obtained in this work are still concentrated at the small scales , indicating that the dynamo do not have enough time to reach the linear phase .",
    "the results then depend on the numerical resolution employed , and the magnetic energy amplifications obtained should be considered as lower limits .",
    "the maximum amplification factor for the magnetic field we obtained is @xmath2 14 , for model hai .",
    "when considering a larger domain , the amplification factor duplicates ( see sect .",
    "[ limitations ] ) , therefore the amplified magnetic field that we obtained is @xmath87  @xmath3 g .",
    "this lower limit value is in agreement with the inferred values of the magnetic fields in cassiopeia a ( @xmath2 100 @xmath3 g ) and tycho s snrs ( @xmath2 300 @xmath3 g ) @xcite .",
    "we found that , under the setup considered , the statistical details of the density fluctuations ( power spectrum slope and anisotropies in the density structures ) have little influence on the final magnetic field amplification .",
    "therefore , for the same @xmath88 and @xmath58 , no significant differences were found between density fields built synthetically or obtained from mhd turbulence .",

    "<S> galactic cosmic rays are believed to be mostly accelerated at supernova shocks . </S>",
    "<S> however , the interstellar magnetic field is too weak to efficiently accelerate galactic cosmic rays up to the highest energies , i.e. @xmath0 ev </S>",
    "<S> . a stronger magnetic field in the pre - shock region could provide the efficiency required . </S>",
    "<S> bell s cosmic - ray nonresonant streaming instability has been claimed to be responsible for the amplification of precursor magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> however , an alternative mechanism has been proposed in which the cosmic - ray pressure gradient forms the shock precursor and drives turbulence , amplifying the magnetic field via the small - scale dynamo . a key ingredient for the mechanism to operate are the inhomogeneities present in the interstellar medium ( ism ) . </S>",
    "<S> these inhomogeneities are the consequence of turbulence . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we explore the magnetic field amplification in different ism conditions through 3d mhd numerical simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> [ firstpage ]    acceleration of particles  cosmic rays  mhd  shock waves  turbulence  methods : numerical    cosmic rays ( crs ) are high - energy particles with energies between @xmath1 ev whose origin has been subject of debate since the beginning of research in the field ( e.g. , * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ) . from energetic constraints </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown that crs with energies up to @xmath0 ev ( the so called _ knee _ ) are of galactic origin ( see blasi 2013 , and references there in ) . </S>",
    "<S> the main galactic cr sources are believed to be supernova remnants ( snrs ) shocks , where particles are accelerated through the diffusive shock mechanism ( e.g. , * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ) </S>",
    "<S> .    the pressure of crs can be comparable to the pressure of the background medium , so they produce dynamical effects on the background plasma and magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ) ; crs modify shocks ( see , * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * and references there in ) . </S>",
    "<S> the accelerated particles can extract significant energy from the shocked flow . </S>",
    "<S> the high - energy particles diffuse ahead of the shock producing a pressure gradient upstream of the shock transition that smoothly decelerates and compresses flow into the shock , and a shock precursor is formed .    </S>",
    "<S> a serious problem on the theory of cr acceleration in snr shocks is that the magnetic field strengths in the upstream region , i.e. the @xmath2 5 @xmath3 g ism magnetic fields , are too weak for efficiently accelerate crs of pev energies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> pev crs have long mean free paths in such fields and have a high probability of escaping the shock , so they are not subject to further acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> the problem might be solved if the magnetic field in the pre - shock region can be much stronger than its interstellar value and if the free energy available for the shock is sufficient to generate much larger fields .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , indirect observational arguments require higher magnetic fields at the snr shocks , higher than expected by simple shock compression . </S>",
    "<S> detection of rapid variability in x - ray emission from a supernova remnant indicates an amplification factor of the magnetic field of more than 100 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> upstream magnetic field amplification not only should occur in snr shocks , but in other strong shock waves in the ism produced , for example , by massive star winds , stellar outflows , jets , etc . </S>",
    "<S> also observational evidence suggests that radio relics host relatively large magnetic fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic field amplification might occur at the weak shocks that produce the radio relics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> @xcite proposed the current driven instability to overcome this problem . </S>",
    "<S> the driving electric current of the instability comes from drift ( streaming ) of the escaping crs . </S>",
    "<S> the reacting current of the background plasma leads to a transverse force that can amplify transverse perturbations in the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> however , this mechanism can only generate fields on scales smaller than the gyro - radius of the driving particles , and the generated fields are on scales too small to be used to accelerate the highest energy particles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other process might occur simultaneously </S>",
    "<S> . another instability has been proposed ( e.g. , * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ) , the drury acoustic instability @xcite , which is the enhancement of compressible perturbations by the cr pressure gradient . </S>",
    "<S> this instability potentially can have faster growth rates than the bell instability and operates on larger scales . </S>",
    "<S> the relative role of different instabilities in generating magnetic field in front of the shock is currently the field of active research .    </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( henceforth bjl09 ) have presented an alternative process that can provide fast magnetic field generation . in the bjl09 model the magnetic field is generated by purely non - linear fluid mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> the cr pressure gradient accelerates differentially the denser and lighter parts of the ism upstream flow carrying density inhomogeneities , generating in this way local shear or vorticity . </S>",
    "<S> this vorticity drives a ( supersonic ) turbulence cascade . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic energy is amplified on scales of the order and below the scales of the vorticity structures ( of the order of the density structures scales ) through the small - scale dynamo ( e.g. , * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ) . </S>",
    "<S> this idea was later elaborated by @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the inhomogeneities observed in the ism covering an extended range of scales , the spectrum of these density fluctuations are consistent with kolmogorov turbulence , the so - called `` big power law in the sky '' @xcite ; density inhomogeneities are present in many astrophysical plasmas and are usually associated with magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ism is composed by different phases according to the physical conditions of the material . </S>",
    "<S> these physical conditions establish different regimes of mhd turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the typical values for the density fluctuations amplitudes and scales from the turbulent ism would allow a magnetic field amplification larger in scales and strength than that provided by the bell s instability ( beresnyak , jones , & lazarian 2009 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> @xcite presented the first study on the turbulent magnetic field amplification driven by cr pressure gradients using 2d mhd simulations ; later on they extended this work and compared the results with 3d simulations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they found that independent of the detailed plasma physics , as long as there is a cosmic ray precursor with a significant associated pressure gradient , and assuming the inflowing medium is inhomogeneous , the magnetic field can be amplified in the precursor by a factor @xmath4 ( depending mainly on the direction of the uniform initial magnetic field ) .    </S>",
    "<S> @xcite also studied upstream magnetic field amplification by turbulence using 3d and mostly 2d mhd simulations ; weak shocks of galaxy clusters were also considered . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the amplification relying on the hydromagnetic turbulence the 2d treatment is not adequate ( because the physics of the turbulent cascade is different from the 3d real case ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the above mentioned works considered a synthetically built density fluctuations spectrum for representing the medium inhomogeneities .    in this work we also study turbulence - induced magnetic field amplification in shock upstream , exploring the details of the turbulence developed in the precursor . </S>",
    "<S> we use density structures obtained in different regimes of compressible mhd isothermal turbulence simulations to represent the inhomogeneities in the medium swept by the shock , in order to compare with the simplest density structures built artificially . </S>",
    "<S> we aim at studying the magnetic field amplification for different conditions of the ism , under the ideas presented by bjl09 . here </S>",
    "<S> we deal only with magnetic field amplification by turbulence in the pre - shock region . </S>",
    "<S> post - shock turbulence can further amplify the magnetic field downstream ; this situation is studied elsewhere ( e.g. , * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ) .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper is organized as follows . in the next section </S>",
    "<S> we describe the magnetic field amplification model developed in bjl09 and we highlight the existence of the density homogeneities in the ism , one of the main ingredients of the mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> section  [ sec : numset ] describes the numerical setup we adopt in the mhd simulations . in the section  [ sec : results ] </S>",
    "<S> we present the results and data analysis . </S>",
