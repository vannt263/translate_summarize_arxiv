    "let @xmath1 be an embedded minimal surface in @xmath2",
    ". by the monotonicity formula , the area density @xmath3 is nondecreasing .",
    "if @xmath4 we say that @xmath1 has quadratic area growth , or the area growth of @xmath5 planes .                for surfaces with the growth of 2 planes , there are two canonical examples : the catenoid ( fig [ fig : catenoid ] ) , and scherk s singly periodic surfaces , which occur in a one parameter family ( fig [ fig : scherk ] and fig [ fig : scherk1 ] ) , where the parameter is the angle betwee the two leaves .",
    "as the angle goes to zero , the scherk surfaces approach a catenoid on compact sets after an appropriate rescaling . in 2005",
    ", meeks and wolf proved the following theorem :    @xcite[thm : periodic ] suppose that @xmath1 is an embedded minimal surface in @xmath2 which has infinite symmetry group and @xmath6 .",
    "then @xmath1 is either a catenoid or a scherk example .",
    "meeks has conjectured that the symmetry condition in the above may be removed :    @xcite let @xmath1 be an embedded minimal surface in @xmath2 with area growth of 2 planes . then @xmath1 is either a catenoid or a scherk example .",
    "however , an initial difficulty with the above is that it is not yet known that a minimal surface with quadratic growth even needs to be asymptotic to a catenoid or a scherk example . by the compactness theory from gmt ,",
    "it is known that if @xmath1 is an embedded minimal surface with quadratic area growth , then for any sequence @xmath7 , there exists a subsequence @xmath8 such that @xmath9 converges to a minimal cone @xmath10 in the varifold topology .",
    "such a cone @xmath10 is called a * tangent cone at infinity*. a priori , there may be many tangent cones at infinity .",
    "this leads to the following conjecture , also due to meeks :    @xcite let @xmath1 be an embedded minimal surface in @xmath2 with quadratic area growth",
    ". then @xmath1 has a unique tangent cone at infinity .    in the case of finite genus , this had already been resolved by collin @xcite , who proved that any minimal surface with finite genus and quadratic area growth must be asymptotic to a single multiplicity @xmath5 plane .",
    "in particular , when combined with a result of schoen @xcite , this resolves meeks full conjecture in the case of finite genus - that is , the only minimal surface with the area growth of two planes and finite genus is the catenoid .    in this paper , we prove that meeks conjecture holds true under additional assumptions :    [ thm : sublin1 ] let @xmath1 be an embedded minimal surface with the area growth of @xmath5 planes .",
    "suppose that there exists @xmath11 such that for all @xmath12 sufficiently large , there exists a line @xmath13 @xmath14 is a union of at least @xmath15 disks @xmath16 and such that @xmath17 is homotopically nontrivial in @xmath18 .",
    "then @xmath1 has a unique tangent cone at infinity .",
    "this leads to the following :    [ cor : sublin ] let @xmath1 be an embedded minimal surface with quadratic area growth .",
    "let @xmath19 then if for some @xmath20 , @xmath21 is a union of @xmath15 topological disks @xmath16 each with finitely many boundary components , then @xmath1 has a unique tangent cone at infinity .    note that the corollary substitutes the homotopy requirement from the theorem for the existence of a single line around which we can base our sublinearly growing set .",
    "the author would like to thank his advisor , william minicozzi , as well as jonathan zhu , frank morgan , ao sun , and nick strehlke for their comments and suggestions throughout the writing of this paper .",
    "the proof of this begins with the following :    [ lem : lab ] suppose that @xmath1 satisfies the conditions of theorem [ thm : sublin1 ] .",
    "then for some @xmath22 @xmath23    we will work on each leaf @xmath16 separately , and the lemma will come from adding the area of all the leaves together .    first note that @xmath24 is a rotationally symmetric solid torus and ( since @xmath16 is a disk ) , @xmath17 is contractible in @xmath25 .",
    "however , since @xmath25 is rotationally symmetric , the smallest spanning disk for any such curve has area at least that of a vertical cross section @xmath26 .",
    "any such vertical cross section consists of a half - circle of radius @xmath12 minus a strip of length @xmath27 and width @xmath28 .",
    "thus , we have    @xmath29    note that lemma [ lem : lab ] implies that there are in fact exactly @xmath15 disks in the statement of theorem [ thm : sublin1 ] .",
    "we make a definition :    the * error * at scale @xmath30 of a minimal surfaces with area growth of @xmath5 planes is defined as @xmath31    thus , the lemma [ lem : lab ] is equivalent to the statement :    @xmath32    we now apply an argument of brian white @xcite to prove uniqueness of the tangent cone .    let @xmath1 satisfy the following : @xmath33 such that for @xmath34 , @xmath35 then @xmath1 has a unique tangent cone at infinity .",
    "define @xmath36 . then note that @xmath37 is equal to the area of the projection of @xmath38 onto the unit sphere .",
    "we will bound this area .",
    "we have : @xmath39^{1/2 }                                                   \\left[\\int_{\\sigma\\cap b_r{\\backslash}b_s}\\frac{1}{|x|^2 } d\\sigma\\right]^{1/2 } \\\\",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by monotonicity , the term inside the first bracket is smaller than @xmath40 . also , the term in the second bracket can be bounded by distance and area .",
    "thus , we get that the above is smaller than @xmath41 now , by equation ( [ eqn : errbd ] ) , along with the fact that @xmath42 , we have that this is bounded by @xmath43^{1/2 } \\leq c\\frac{r}{s^{(1-\\alpha)/2 + 1}}\\ ] ] pick @xmath44 and @xmath30 such that @xmath45 . then @xmath46 we then sum the above bound to see @xmath47 as @xmath48 , this term goes to zero .",
    "thus , the area of the projection of @xmath49 approaches zero as @xmath30 gets large , which means that the tangent cone must be unique .",
    "let @xmath16 be one of the components of @xmath50 . then note that the closure of @xmath16 in @xmath0 must be conformally equivalent to @xmath51 with finitely many boundary points removed .",
    "take a neighborhood @xmath52 of one of these missing boundary points which does not come close to any other missing boundary points .",
    "then @xmath53 has exactly one boundary component .",
    "there are two options for the shape of @xmath54 .    1 .",
    "the function @xmath55 is unbounded in both directions .",
    "@xmath55 is bounded in one direction .",
    "note that @xmath56 can not be bounded in both directions , as then @xmath54 would be compact , which it is not .",
    "we temporarily assume that option 1 occurs .",
    "let @xmath57 be the portion of @xmath54 which is not on the boundary of @xmath58 .",
    "take @xmath20 larger so that @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath60 .",
    "then some component of @xmath61 will satisfy the conditions of theorem [ thm : sublin1 ] .",
    "this implies that it is possible to prove the lower area bound lemma for this component , and in particular , the area must be asymptotic to @xmath62 .",
    "the following lemma will complete our proof :    under our assumptions , option 2 is not possible .",
    "suppose that option 2 occurs .",
    "wlog , let @xmath55 be bounded below by 0 , and let @xmath63 be the point at which that minimum is achieved .",
    "let @xmath64 .",
    "let @xmath26 be a catenoid where the radius of the center geodesic is strictly larger than @xmath65 .",
    "then by a simple application of the maximum principle , @xmath52 must intersect @xmath26 .",
    "in particular , this implies that @xmath66 .",
    "now , consider a sequence of @xmath67 such that @xmath68 converges to a tangent cone at infinity . by compactness , @xmath69 must either converge to a union of geodesics on @xmath70 or must disappear at infinity .",
    "however , due to the discussion of the previous paragraph , @xmath52 can not disappear at infinty , and so must converge to a nontrivial union of geodesics @xmath71 , possibly with endpoints at the north or south poles .",
    "let @xmath72 be a nonsmooth point on @xmath73 .",
    "then there must exist a neighborhood @xmath74 of @xmath72 such that @xmath75 restricted to @xmath76 is unbounded as @xmath77 .",
    "however , since @xmath52 is a minimal disk with quadratic area growth bounds , @xmath78 must be bounded by @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the distance of @xmath81 from the boundary of @xmath52",
    ".    suppose that @xmath72 is not equal to the south pole .",
    "then we can choose our neighborhood @xmath74 of @xmath72 to stay away from the @xmath56 axis , so we will have that @xmath82 uniformly on @xmath76 .",
    "suppose that @xmath72 is equal to the south pole . then by the assumption of option 2 , @xmath54",
    "is only contained in the region @xmath83 .",
    "so , we can choose @xmath84 , and this implies the same uniform @xmath75 bound .",
    "therefore , there will be no nonsmooth points of @xmath85 , which implies that @xmath71 consists of a single great circle passing through the north pole .",
    "in particular , this implies that there are some @xmath86 such that the area of @xmath87 is greater than @xmath88 , where @xmath89 as @xmath90 .",
    "thus , we have at least @xmath15 components of @xmath91 , each of which has area growth at least @xmath62 by the discussion of option 1",
    ". however , since the global area growth is @xmath92 , no component can have growth @xmath93 .",
    "there are several potential extensions of the work above . theorem",
    "[ thm : sublin1 ] and corollary [ cor : sublin ] effectively assume that all tangent cones of @xmath1 are unions of planes _ with a common axis_. it is likely not significantly more difficult to show that the same result holds in the case when the one - dimensional singular set is more complicated , as long as away from a sublinearly growing neighborhood , @xmath1 is a union of disks .",
    "that is , we have the following as another potential step towards the resolution of meeks conjecture :    let @xmath1 have the area growth of @xmath5 planes , and suppose that there exists a uniform @xmath94 such that for each @xmath95 , the following is true : there exist line segments @xmath96 , @xmath97 such that outside of an @xmath98sublinearly growing neighborhood of @xmath99 , @xmath100 is a union of disks .",
    "then @xmath1 has a unique tangent cone at infinity ."
