    "the theoretical justification for the existence of classical magnetic poles , hereafter called monopoles , is that they add symmetry to maxwell s equations and explain charge quantization @xcite .",
    "dirac showed that the mere existence of a monopole in the universe could offer an explanation of the discrete nature of the electric charge .",
    "his analysis leads to the dirac quantization condition ( dqc ) ,    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the electron charge , @xmath10 the monopole magnetic charge and we use natural units @xmath11 . in dirac",

    "( [ dqc ] ) , establishing the value of their magnetic charge .",
    "their mass , @xmath12 , is a parameter of the theory .",
    "monopoles and their experimental detection have been a subject of much study since many believe in dirac s statement @xcite ,    _  ... one would be surprised if nature had made no use of it [ the monopole ] . \"",
    "_    0.2 cm all experimental searches for magnetic monopoles up to now have met with failure @xcite .",
    "these experiments have led to a lower mass limit in the range of @xmath13 gev .",
    "the lack of experimental confirmation has led many physicists to abandon the hope in their existence .    although monopoles symmetrize maxwell s equations in form , there is a numerical asymmetry arising from the dqc , namely that the basic magnetic charge is much larger than the smallest electric charge .",
    "this led dirac himself in his 1931 paper @xcite to state ,    _  ... the attractive force between two one - quantum poles of opposite sign is @xmath14 times that between the electron and the proton .",
    "this very large force may perhaps account for why the monopoles have never been separated . \" _",
    "0.2 cm inspired by this old idea of dirac and zeldovich @xcite , namely , that monopoles are not seen freely because they are confined by their strong magnetic forces forming a bound state called monopolium @xcite , we proposed that monopolium , due to its bound state structure , might be easier to detect than free monopoles @xcite .",
    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , which entered last year in operation colliding @xmath15-tev protons , will probe the energy frontier opening possibilities for new physics including the discovery of magnetic monopoles either directly , a possibility contemplated long time ago @xcite , and revisited frequently @xcite or through the discovery of monopolium , as advocated in refs .",
    "the direct observation is based on the search for highly ionizing massive particles at the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite detectors or at the moedal experiment  @xcite , which is designed to search precisely for such exotic states .",
    "if instead of single monopoles ( antimonopoles ) we deal with monopole - antimonopole pairs , as is the case at lhc , we expect that due to the very strong interaction many of them annihilate into photons inside the detector , either directly or by forming a monopolium bound state which will also disintegrate producing photons .",
    "therefore we are led to study the production of monopoles and monopolium at lhc by the mechanism of photon fusion and its subsequent decay into two photons @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we describe the dynamics of monopoles and review the production of monopole - antimonopole pairs .",
    "section  [ dynamics ] discusses the annihilation of the virtual monopole - antimonopole pair into photons . in section",
    "[ monopole ] we review the production of monopolium and study its annihilation into photons . in section  [ monopolium ]",
    "we describe how to incorporate the elementary processes into @xmath16 scattering . in section  [ results ]",
    "we present our results in the context of the present running features of lhc and in the last section we draw conclusions of our studies .",
    "the theory of monopole interactions was initially formulated by dirac @xcite and later on developed in two different approaches by schwinger @xcite and zwanziger @xcite .",
    "the formalism of schwinger can be cast in functional form as a field theory for monopole - electron interaction which is dual to quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite .",
    "the monopoles are considered fermions and behave as electrons in qed with a large coupling constant as a result of the dqc . in this formulation",
    "the conventional photon field is dirac string dependent . due to the large coupling constant and the string dependence ,",
    "perturbative treatments  la feynman are in principle not well defined .",
    "however , non perturbative high energy treatments , like the eikonal approximation , have rendered well defined electron - monopole cross sections @xcite . for the case of monopole production at",
    "energies higher than their mass the above procedure is not applicable , and being the treatment non perturbative , there is no universally accepted prediction from field theory .",
    "a different scheme to understand monopole interactions was proposed by ginzburg and schiller @xcite . using standard electroweak theory in the one - loop approximation to",
    "lowest non - vanishing order they derived an effective theory with coupling ,    @xmath17    where @xmath10 is the monopole coupling , @xmath18 the photon energy of the vertex and @xmath12 the monopole mass .",
    "thus , for virtualities smaller than @xmath18 and @xmath19 , one can derive an effective heinsenberg - euler type effective lagrangian for the box diagram with a small coupling @xcite .",
    "however , one can always ask the question : what will happen at higher orders ? how can one treat the divergencies ?",
    "the authors argue that in this kinematical region general considerations like gauge invariance , threshold behavior , etc .",
    ", together with the perturbative approach allows an effective theory analogous to standard qed in lowest non trivial order only .",
    "certainly their procedure is a conjecture that is meaningful from the point of view of effective theories .",
    "effective theories are in general non renormalizable .",
    "higher orders would require counter terms with unknown constants to be fitted by experiments .",
    "if their philosophy is accepted it corresponds nature to prove it or disprove it .",
    "the ginzburg - schiller prescription is only valid below the monopole production threshold , and as such not very powerful from the point of view of phenomenology , because virtual particles , very far off - shell , can be easily confused with other scenarios .",
    "a complementary idea was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and is beautifully explained in the thesis of mulhearn @xcite .",
    "these authors realized that a monopole interacts with an electron like a ( duality transformed ) positron , and therefore the effective coupling for electron - monopole is simply @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the velocity of the monopole . in order to study monopole - antimonopole production processes ( via drell - yan ) they simply turned the diagram around , thus constructing an effective vertex with coupling @xmath20 ( see fig .",
    "[ vertices ] ) .",
    "this scheme has been used to define an effective field theory to lowest order @xcite which has been applied to drell - yan like monopole - antimonopole production @xcite and to monopole - antimonopole production by photon fusion @xcite ( see fig .  [ mmproduction ] ) .",
    "non perturbative solutions of field theories lead to momentum - dependent coupling constants and even momentum dependent masses .",
    "for example , the resolution of truncated dyson - schwinger equations leads to the freezing of the qcd running coupling ( effective charge ) in the infrared , which is best understood as a dynamical generation of a gluon mass function , giving rise to a momentum dependence which is free from infrared divergences @xcite .",
    "these studies have motivated our starting hypothesis .",
    "we consider the diagrams of the fig .",
    "[ vertices ] as the diagrams of an effective theory where    @xmath22    and moreover , we assume , with ginzburg and schiller , that this effective theory is valid only to lowest non - vanishing order .",
    "the momentum dependence is probably much more involved , but we know of two instances where it reduces to @xmath21 g , namely those of the figures .",
    "effective theories , as it was said , are not renormalizable , and moreover higher orders in the field expansion will require additional counter terms and new constants to be fitted to the data , therefore our theory is at present only defined to lowest non - vanishing order . to construct the higher order approximation we should apply weinberg s theorem @xcite and construct all terms compatible with the symmetries . at present , and close to monopole - antimonopole threshold , we expect the lowest order term to be sufficient , for our purposes .",
    "guided by simplicity and phenomenological inspiration we introduce an effective theory which is finite and well defined and we call this proposal the _ @xmath21 scheme_.    note that the ginzburg - schiller scheme and the @xmath21 scheme are in some sense complementary .",
    "the former is valid below the monopole threshold , while the latter above since @xmath21 vanishes below threshold .",
    "the aim here is to study possible signals of magnetic monopoles at lhc .",
    "according to previous studies @xcite , the most promising mechanism is photon fusion .",
    "the elementary diagrams contributing to pair production are those in fig .",
    "[ mmproduction ] , where the explicit couplings have been shown .",
    "the photon - fusion elementary cross section is obtained from the well - known qed electron - positron pair creation cross section @xcite , simply changing the coupling constant ( @xmath23 ) and the electron mass by the monopole mass @xmath24 , leading to    @xmath25    where @xmath21 is the monopole velocity , a function of the center - of - mass energy , @xmath26 . in fig .",
    "[ mmxsection1 ] we show the @xmath27 dependence of the adimensional functional form of eq.([ggxsecmm ] ) to show the effect of the @xmath28 coupling .",
    "the solid curve corresponds to the electron - positron case , the dashed one to the monopole case which contains the @xmath29 factor .",
    "one should notice the large effect associated with this factor in the vicinity of the threshold .",
    "lhc detectors , apart from the moedal experiment @xcite , have not been designed specifically to see monopoles directly and therefore even those which do not annihilate inside the detectors will be difficult to detect .",
    "however , the extreme sensitivity of lhc detectors to photons , due to the importance of the 2@xmath30 channel in detecting a low mass higgs , makes them ideal for the purpose of detecting monopole - antimonopole annihilation .",
    "the two photon process through monopole loops in the ginzburg - schiller scheme was studied already sometime ago both theoretically in ref .",
    "@xcite and experimentally in ref .",
    "we have proceeded in this paper to perform the calculation in the @xmath21 scheme .",
    "it is natural to think that the enormous strength and long range of the monopole interaction leads to the annihilation of the pair into photons very close to the production point .",
    "thus one should look for monopoles through their annihilation into highly energetic photons , a channel for which lhc detectors have been optimized .    in order to calculate the annihilation into photons",
    "we assume that our effective theory , a technically convenient modification of ginzburg and schiller s , agrees with qed at one loop order , and therefore we apply light - by - light scattering with the appropriate modifications as shown in fig .",
    "[ mmannihilation ] . an interesting feature of the calculation is that the additional magnetic coupling will increase the cross section dramatically and therefore this measurement should lead to a strong restriction on the monopole mass . however , as we have seen , in @xmath31 production , the large magnetic coupling is always multiplied by the small electric one , leading to effective couplings @xmath32 , and the same will happen in detection .",
    "thus , the effective coupling of the process is @xmath33 , and therefore has strengths similar to the strong interaction , not more .",
    "light - by - light scattering was studied by karplus and neuman @xcite , who reproduced all previous low energy results by euler @xcite and high energy results by achieser @xcite , and was later revisited and corrected by csonka and koelbig @xcite .    in the case of monopoles , with the appropriate changes , the expression for the cross section becomes ,    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is @xmath36 in the notation of ref .",

    "we note that the forward cross section is larger and the right - angle one smaller , than that for any other value of the scattering angle . as the energy increases the drop in the @xmath37 function from @xmath38 to @xmath39 increases .",
    "it is clear from these figures that close to the threshold the cross section is quite isotropic and away from threshold the forward cross section , which is very difficult to measure , is much larger than the right - angle one . since the detectors can not detect all of the photons coming out , we take the right - angle cross section as a conservative indication of the magnitudes to be expected .    in fig .

    "thus the effect of the binding is twofold : it increases the cross section and it lowers the threshold from @xmath62 the monopole - antimonopole production threshold . to observe the other dependence , in fig .",
    "[ mmonopolemasses ] we fix the binding energy to @xmath51 gev and vary the monopole mass .",
    "the effect goes inversely proportional to the monopole mass , i.e. , the lower the monopole mass the larger the cross sections .",
    "gev and different binding energies for monopolium : solid line @xmath116 gev , dashed @xmath117 gev and dotted @xmath118 gev . ]",
    "gev ( solid ) , @xmath104 gev ( dashed ) , @xmath48 gev ( dotted ) and fixed binding energy ( @xmath51 gev ) . ]    we can summarize our findings by stating that low monopole masses and large bindings favor the detection of monopolium .",
    "monopolium has the advantage over the monopole - antimonopole process of lowering the threshold , narrowing the bump and increasing the cross section with binding energy . in fig .",
    "[ mmmhiggs ] we show three interesting effects , namely the two photon decays of higgs , monopolium and monopole - antimonopole annihilation .",
    "the higgs signal has been increased over the background by a factor of 50 .",
    "the parameters for the monopolium cross section shown are @xmath50 gev and @xmath119 gev , which have been chosen so that its signal is of the same size of that of the monopole - antimonopole annihilation with a monopole mass of also @xmath104 gev .",
    "we note two of the features mentioned before , the lower threshold and the narrower bump structure . if we would increase the binding by a few tens of gev the height of the bump would increase considerably with respect to the monopole - antimonopole cross section ( recall fig .",
    "[ mggebind ] ) .",
    "note that the @xmath84 conventional background at the monopole scenario in this kinematical region is extremely small , as measured recently by atlas in diphoton studies @xcite and while searching for @xmath120  @xcite .",
    "gev and that of the monopolium @xmath115 gev .",
    "the background has been obtained from ref .",
    "]    if a broad bump would appear experimentally it could certainly arise from monopole dynamics .",
    "thereafter the way to distinguish between the decay of monopolium and the annihilation of monopole - antimonopole would be through the angular dependence . in the present scenario , a spin zero monopolium",
    ", the angular decay properties would be similar to that of para - positronium @xcite , while that of monopole - antimonopole would be analogous to light - by - light scattering in qed @xcite .",
    "moreover , the two pehenomena could occur simultaneausly , as happens in the case of electrons and positrons , where we have in light - by - light scattering electron - positron annihilation and positronium decay .",
    "if the latter were the case two bumps , if the overlap is not large , or a very broad flat bump , if the overlap is considerable , could be seen .",
    "the existence of one or two bumps depends very strongly on the binding dynamics and the monopole mass .",
    "note that there is no possible confusion with the higgs , since its width is narrow compared to its mass .",
    "moreover , the scattering cross section for a heavy higgs in the two photon channel is extremely small compared to that in the other channels , and therefore , its characteristics would be known by the time a two photon bump would be seen .",
    "the existence of dirac monopoles would modify our understanding of qed .",
    "the dqc is a beautiful consequence of the existence of monopoles and therefore they represent an extremely appealing physical scenario .",
    "there is as of yet no experimental proof of their existence .",
    "this has led to approximate mass bounds which suggest a mass scale for the monopole above 500 gev .",
    "lhc opens up this energy regime for research and therefore monopoles become again a subject of exciting experimental search .",
    "the dqc , implying a huge magnetic coupling constant , complicates matters from the theoretical point of view .",
    "non perturbative methods are required .",
    "we have avoided the problem by using an effective theory valid at one loop order . in our scheme , the effective coupling @xmath20 is still large away from threshold , but the expected high monopole masses provide a convenient cut - off which makes the theory meaningful . in the context of this theoretical scheme",
    "we are able to calculate monopole(antimonopole ) production and monopole - antimonopole annihilation . centering our description to lhc , a proton machine , we have described scenarios for the production of monopole - antimonopole pairs via photon fusion .",
    "we have described their annihilation into photons via the conventional box diagram , analogous to that of light - by - light scattering in conventional qed .",
    "the only difference in our approach is the introduction of a threshold factor in the form of a velocity .",
    "we have analyzed in detail the elementary process , light - by - light scattering at monopole energies , and have subsequently incorporated the description of the photon - photon elementary scattering into the initial proton - proton collision .",
    "one main assumption is that no other particle contributes to the box diagram in the region of interest .",
    "we have chosen in the present calculation a mass range which is above conventional particle masses and below the supersymmetric particle ranges .",
    "one could think of interference with elementary particle decays , however the latter would have a resonant structure which our box diagram does not have .",
    "thus any interference would be avoided by their different geometric structure .    with all these preventions",
    "we have shown that monopoles up to 1 tev in mass should be detected at lhc in the @xmath40 channel at present running energies and with present luminosities .",
    "the signature is a rise of the cross section which should stay for a long energy range , because no resonant peak structure is to be expected .",
    "even if monopoles exist it might be possible that due to the very strong magnetic coupling they do not appear as free states but bound forming monopolium , a neutral state , very difficult to detect directly .",
    "we have analyzed the coupling of monopolium to photons and its contribution to light - by - light like scattering , i.e. monopolium s dynamical decay .",
    "we have found that for reasonable values of the monopole mass and relatively small , compared with their mass , binding energies , spin - zero monopolium disintegrates into two gammas with cross sections which are reachable with the currently available lhc integrated luminosity of 5 fb@xmath1 .",
    "our investigations go beyond this wishful scenario .",
    "we have seen that the cross section depends both on the mass on the monopole and on that of monopolium , increasing inversely proportional to the monopole mass and being directly proportional to the binding energy .",
    "this means that similar cross section can be achieved with very heavy monopoles if the binding energy is large .    to conclude , without doubt",
    ", the appearance of a broad signal at threshold , in the two photon cross section , should be considered as a clear manifestation of the monopole presence .",
    "the implementation of our findings in detector analysis would provide actual observations .",
