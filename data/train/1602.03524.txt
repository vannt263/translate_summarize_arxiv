    "dwarf galaxies are the lowest - mass inhabitants of the extragalactic universe .",
    "their haloes are predominantly made up of dark matter ( dm ) , which makes them the ideal probing ground for dark matter or alternative gravity theories .",
    "moreover , their relatively shallow gravitational potential makes their evolution very sensitive to all sorts of internal and external physical processes , ranging from stellar feedback by supernovae to the heating by an external uv - background ( uvb ) . for this reasons ,",
    "numerical simulations of the formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies provide a promising way to solve many questions about the existence and character of dark matter @xcite , the strength and timing of the uvb @xcite and the specifics of star formation and stellar feedback @xcite .",
    "there are two major classes of numerical simulations of dwarf galaxies .",
    "cosmological zoom - simulations start with a large cosmological box filled with dark matter and optionally baryons , and locally increase the resolution by means of refinement levels @xcite .",
    "some of these simulations focus on more massive haloes and mainly study dwarf galaxies as satellites or close companions of these haloes .",
    "these satellite haloes are influenced by the presence of their host and it remains unclear if this makes them fundamentally different from the isolated field dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "since the best observational data about dwarf galaxies comes from milky way satellites , this type of constrained simulations is very useful .",
    "there are also zoom simulations of individual isolated dwarf galaxies @xcite or groups of dwarf galaxies @xcite . setting up a cosmological zoom simulation however requires a careful selection of an appropriate zoom region , which is an expensive process that requires a suite of preliminary simulations to be run and even then allows for little control over the final properties of the selected halo .",
    "simulations of isolated dwarf galaxy haloes either start with an idealized set - up containing a dark matter halo with a theoretically derived density profile and a gas halo embedded therein to study the self - consistent formation of the galaxy @xcite , or start with a fully self - consistent galaxy including a stellar disk and subject this galaxy to external processes @xcite . because these simulations only contain the mass that resides in the dwarf halo , it is possible to obtain much higher resolutions than for zoom - simulations , with less computational cost .",
    "this also allows for a large parameter survey where not only model parameters but also structural parameters can be easily changed .",
    "however , these simulations do not take into account cosmological effects like the large scale gravitational potential or the effects of mass accretion , apart from the initial density profile , which is derived from cosmological simulations .",
    "this drawback can be alleviated by running merger simulations which take into account the merger history of the isolated halo @xcite .",
    "the ultimate goal of numerical dwarf galaxy simulations is to produce model data that can be compared to observed dwarf galaxies to constrain theoretical models .",
    "we therefore need to find model quantities that can be easily and unambiguously observed .",
    "an often quoted relation is the so called @xmath0 relation @xcite , which links haloes from large scale cosmological ( zoom-)simulations to observed stellar mass aggregates by means of an abundance matching technique .",
    "this relation is not applicable in the dwarf regime however , since ( a ) halo masses can not easily nor unambiguously be observed , and ( b ) the starting premise of the technique , i.e. the most massive halo corresponds to the most luminous stellar aggregate , breaks down at low masses @xcite .",
    "a more accessible tracer of the halo potential is the circular velocity , which can be measured from resolved rotation curves .",
    "together with the observed stellar and neutral gas mass , this quantity yields the so - called baryonic tully - fisher relation ( btfr ) @xcite .",
    "this purely observational relation is a more promising candidate for model comparisons , since it relates a halo property to baryonic properties .",
    "@xcite discuss the position of a set of simulated dsph satellites on the tully - fisher relation , but to our knowledge , no simulated btfr in the dwarf regime has been published before .    without an uvb , numerically producing dwarf galaxies that have realistic observational properties poses no real challenge @xcite , especially since there is a degeneracy between the stellar feedback parameters and the position of the resulting dwarf galaxy on a range of observational scaling relations @xcite . however , these systems tend to have unrealistically high stellar masses and bursty sfhs @xcite .",
    "when the uvb is taken into account , the evolution of these galaxies looks a lot different  : star formation is limited to very early in the simulation , after which the galaxies become gas poor and star formation stops @xcite . or star formation is delayed until very late in the simulation , yielding very exotic dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "cosmological zoom - simulations predict that only half of the dark matter halos with circular velocities of @xmath1 host galaxies that are able to form stars , let alone keep neutral gas , and this fraction rapidly decreases towards lower circular velocities @xcite .",
    "this is in disagreement with observed dwarf irregular galaxies ( dirrs ) , which have continuous star formation histories @xcite , are able to keep neutral gas throughout their evolution , and show no clear imprint of reionization @xcite .",
    "the number density of these systems roughly equals that of the dark matter halos from cosmological simulations @xcite , indicating that much more dark matter halos host gas rich , star - forming , low mass dwarf galaxies than predicted .",
    "furthermore , ultra - faint dirrs like leo  p @xcite , leo  t @xcite and pisces  a @xcite have a large neutral gas content and circular velocities of @xmath2 .",
    "this disagreement has two possible explanations  : ( a ) there is something wrong with the simulations and especially the sub - grid model that is employed , or ( b ) there is something wrong with how models and observations are compared , e.g. the halo masses inferred from observations are lower than the corresponding halo masses in simulations .    in this work",
    ", we will run a large suite of simulations of isolated dwarf galaxy haloes to try to reproduce the observed btfr and address this problem .",
    "we will discuss the differences between theoretical quantities and the quantities that are actually observed and try to produce mock observations that resemble the real observations as closely as possible .",
    "this should allow us to reliably compare our models with observed field dirrs and allow us to constrain the details of our galaxy evolution model .",
    "we will focus on three different aspects of our model  : the stellar feedback strength , the strength and timing of the external uvb , and the specifics of a new population iii feedback model .",
    "we will explain how these parameters affect the galaxy star formation history ( sfh ) and how this influences the final position of the galaxy on the btfr .",
    "the paper is structured as follows  : section [ section_model ] gives the details of our simulations and the model parameters .",
    "section [ section_analysis ] gives details about our analysis of the results .",
    "section [ section_results ] gives an overview of the results for the different parameters , including a discussion of the effect of stochasticity and resolution on the final result .",
    "finally , section [ section_conclusion ] will present our conclusions .",
    "we ran a large suite of numerical simulations of isolated dwarf galaxy halos using an adapted version of the n - body / sph code gadget2 @xcite .",
    "the adaptations consist of a model for star formation using sink particles @xcite , gas cooling and heating using a 5 parameter model that includes metal dependent cooling and heating by an ionizing uvb @xcite , stellar feedback from snii , snia , stellar winds and optionally population iii stars , and an advanced equation of state that takes into account the ionization state of the gas @xcite .    in this section ,",
    "we describe the initial conditions of our models , and discuss the different subgrid models and parameters that are varied during our study .",
    "we conclude with a general overview of our models and simulations .",
    "the initial conditions for our isolated halos are generated using a monte carlo sampling technique for both the initial dm - halo and gas halo .",
    "the former is set up as a nfw - halo @xcite with a concentration parameter given by @xcite  : @xmath3 with @xmath4 the total mass of the halo .",
    "the latter is set to be in pseudo thermal equilibrium , with a density profile of the form @xcite  : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is set to equal the scale length of the nfw - halo , while the central density @xmath7 is related to the central density of the nfw - halo through @xmath8 with @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "initially , the particles that sample the dark matter receive random velocities drawn from the isotropic distribution function corresponding to the nfw density profile . to prevent these velocities from erasing the nfw cusp in the scarcely sampled central part of the distribution ,",
    "we construct so - called ` quiet ' initial conditions , in which the velocities are assigned in a symmetric way @xcite .",
    "the gas halo is initially in rest , but is optionally set up with a constant solid body rotation , to study the effect of angular momentum on the dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "the rotation velocity @xmath10 is a model parameter .",
    "all models are run with 50,000 dark matter particles and 50,000 smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) gas particles ( which we will call _ low resolution",
    "_ runs ) . to verify that this is indeed enough to obtain a qualitatively correct behaviour of the resulting dwarf galaxy ,",
    "we ran some of our models with 200,000 particles of each type ( _ high resolution _ runs ) .",
    "note that low and high resolution do not explicitly denote an actual physical resolution difference , but rather a fixed relative resolution difference of a factor of 4 .",
    "the actual mass resolution for the particles is set by the desired total mass of the dark matter halo .",
    "the smoothing length of the gas particles is dynamically set by requiring a fixed number of @xmath11 neighbours for all particles .",
    "the softening length of all components ( dm , gas and stars ) is set to a fixed value , which roughly corresponds to the smoothing length of a gas particle that has a density equal to the density treshold for star formation ( calculated as the radius of a sphere with this density , containing 50 gas particles ) . for clarity , the mass resolution and softening lengths for the different models",
    "have been specified in table  [ table_ics ] .",
    "our models start at a redshift of 12 , which corresponds to a lookback - time of 13.37 gyr with the cosmological parameters employed @xcite , and are run until a redshift of 0 , or until the total computation time exceeded the arbitrary limit of 3 months , which happened for some of the high resolution simulations due to physical reasons .",
    "all simulations were run on our local computing infrastructure , which consists of 5 computing nodes with intel cpus with between 16 and 64 physical cores .",
    "the initial conditions for our simulations contain only 3 free parameters  : the total halo mass @xmath12 that is sampled , the initial rotation velocity @xmath13 and the number of particles used to sample the distributions .",
    "due to the idealized set up of the isolated initial conditions , we might potentially miss two important effects that might shape the btfr  : the accretion of cold gas that will fuel star formation and the angular momentum acquisition of the halo due to mergers . to effectively resolve these effects ,",
    "cosmological zoom simulations are needed .",
    "it is however very computationally expensive to run a parameter study of the size considered in this work with this type of simulations .",
    "to get an idea of the effect of including these effects , we will also consider a merger simulation . instead of simulating a single isolated halo , we set up a system of smaller halos , that are then allowed to merge according to a merger tree that is sampled using the extended press - schechter theory , with a conditional mass function that is fitted to the merger trees from the millenium simulation @xcite .",
    "this allows us to incorporate cosmological effects into our simulations without using full blown cosmological zoom simulations .",
    "the halos we consider are relatively light , so we expect them to only accrete gas through this type of mergers with other small halos , since they lack the mass to acquire unbound uvb heated gas .",
    "the standard uvb we use is the one provided by @xcite , which kicks in at a redshift of 10.5 and reaches its peak strength at a redshift of 2 . since our runs start at a redshift of 12 , the start of the uvb coincides with the onset of star formation in our models .",
    "we therefore also experimented with a uvb that only starts at a redshift of 7 ( we will call this _ late uvb _ runs , contrary to the standard _",
    "early _ uvb ) . to qualify the effect of the uvb on the star formation , we also ran models with a uvb with a strength that is only 10 per cent of the normal strength ( _ low uvb _ runs ) .    the uvb acts as a heating term @xcite and also influences the ionization equilibrium , which introduces a redshift dependence for the cooling curves and the multiphase equation of state ( this is an extension of the model of @xcite ) .",
    "the latter takes into account the potential energy reservoir connected to the ionization of ( mainly ) hydrogen , which breaks the linear dependence of the gas temperature on the internal energy of the gas .",
    "this takes care of the thermal energy absorbed by the ionization of neutral gas in a subgrid fashion , but does not significantly affect our models",
    ".      star formation is modelled using the approach described by @xcite .",
    "if a gas particle is in a region of converging gas flow , has a temperature below 15,000  k and a density above a density threshold of 100 amu @xmath14 @xcite , it is potentially converted into a star particle , which is dynamically equal to a dm particle , but has some extra properties attached to it ( metallicity , formation time , ... ) .",
    "these star formation criteria together with the multiphase equation of state guarantee that only cold , neutral and collapsing gas can form stars .",
    "the probability with which this conversion happens is stochastically sampled to reproduce a schmidt law of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the density of the stars and the gas , and the dynamical time @xmath18 is given by @xmath19    the star formation efficiency is set by a single parameter , @xmath20 .",
    "however , this parameter is degenerate due to the self - regulating character of star formation @xcite .",
    "a lower star formation efficiency leads to a larger initial star formation peak , since gas is converted into stars more slowly and more gas reaches the density threshold before stellar feedback shuts down further star formation efficiently .",
    "this in turn leads to a higher stellar feedback at later times , which suppresses later star formation .",
    "the star formation efficiency parameter is therefore also coupled to another parameter in our system  : the stellar feedback efficiency , which sets the fraction of the stellar feedback that is effectively absorbed by the interstellar medium .",
    "this parameter is closely related to the numerical restrictions of our feedback model  : since we do not resolve the hot gas bubbles around supernova explosions , we do not heat the gas particles in our simulation efficiently enough and most of the energy we put in is radiated away by our cooling model @xcite .",
    "because of this , it is unclear how much energy ultimately ends up in the interstellar medium .",
    "hence the feedback efficiency parameter . to prevent severe over - cooling , we shut off radiative cooling for all gas particles that receive direct stellar feedback from snii and sw , allowing the feedback to spread out adiabatically . for snia feedback",
    "we do not shut off radiative cooling , since this feedback typically affects gas that is more hot and diffuse and does not suffer from over - cooling .",
    "we also present a model in which we do not switch off cooling to illustrate the effect of over - cooling .",
    "due to the degeneracy of the star formation efficiency and feedback efficiency parameters , it suffices to only vary one , while keeping the other fixed .",
    "we choose to fix @xmath20 at a value of 0.1 @xcite .",
    "since this resolution issue affects all types of feedback , we use the same feedback efficiency parameter to scale all energy injections due to stellar feedback , irrespective of the feedback type .",
    "different types of feedback then still differ in relative strength and timing , which will cause them to affect the simulations in distinct ways .",
    "star particles in our simulations return three distinct types of feedback to the surrounding gas during their lifetime .",
    "immediately after the star particle has formed , massive stars with masses in the range @xmath21 will return high energetic radiation to the surrounding ism in the form of stellar winds ( sw ) .",
    "following @xcite , we insert @xmath22 energy due to sw in the surrounding ism , weighted with the fraction of the mass of a single stellar population ( ssp ) that is in the range @xmath21 for a chabrier imf ( @xmath23 ) @xcite and multiplied with the feedback parameter .",
    "this energy injection is spread out uniformly over a time interval @xmath24  myr , corresponding to the lifetime of these massive stars .",
    "when these massive stars reach the end of their lifetime , they explode in snii explosions , which return an energy of @xmath25 to the ism , again weighted with the ssp fraction and the feedback parameter .",
    "this happens in a time interval @xmath26  myr and is also done uniform in time .",
    "next to energy , snii also return material to the ism .",
    "some of it is in the form of h and he , but part of it is also in the form of heavy metals , that enrich the ism . for every ssp , we return a fraction of 0.191 of its mass to the surrounding ism @xcite . for every gas particle",
    ", we also keep track of the mass in fe and mg ( the two metallicity tracers used for the cooling and heating and the advanced gas physics ) . for every ssp",
    ", we return a fraction @xmath27 of its mass as fe and a fraction of @xmath28 of its mass as mg .",
    "all matter is returned uniformly during the same time interval as the snii energy .",
    "stars with masses less than @xmath29 do not give rise to snii explosions .",
    "however , less massive stars can form white dwarfs and if they are part of a binary system , mass overflow between a red giant and its companion white dwarf can cause the latter to exceed its chandrasekhar limit , giving rise to a snia explosion .",
    "if we assume that all stars in the mass range @xmath30 form white dwarfs , we can estimate the number of possible snia explosions from the imf .",
    "this then has to be multiplied with an extra factor to take into account that not all white dwarfs will be part of a binary system and not all binary systems will experience the necessary mass overflow .",
    "we use a fixed ratio of snia to snii explosions of 0.15 @xcite .",
    "these snia explosions also release an energy of @xmath31 to the surrounding ism .",
    "due to the large variety of companion masses in binary systems , snia feedback is spread out over a large interval in time .",
    "we use the gaussian model of @xcite and return the total energy using a normal distribution centered on a delay time of @xmath32  gyr and with a standard deviation of @xmath33 @xcite . to limit the computational overhead caused by returning very low feedback values in the tails of the normal distribution , we limit feedback to a @xmath34 time interval around the gaussian peak value .",
    "snia also return mass and metals to the ism .",
    "we return a fraction of @xmath35 of the mass of the ssp in mass , a fraction of @xmath36 of its mass as fe , and a fraction of @xmath37 as mg @xcite .",
    "when energy or mass is transferred between a star particle and the surrounding ism , we will always spread it out across 50 neighbouring sph particles of the star particles . to this end",
    ", we associate a smoothing length to every star particle and iteratively look for neighbouring sph particles until 50 neighbours are found within this smoothing length",
    ". the energy or mass is then spread out according to the same kernel function that is also used for the sph density calculation and using this smoothing length . to ease the iteration ,",
    "a small deviation in the number of neighbours is allowed .",
    "we set this deviation to 1 for all our runs .      in all our runs ,",
    "the gas starts of with zero metallicity and hence we can consider star particles formed out of this zero metallicity gas to be very metal poor `` population three '' or pop  iii stars .",
    "we can also relax this characterization to include stellar particles with very low , non zero metallicities ( we use the arbitrary upper limit @xmath38 < -5 $ ] ) .",
    "pop  iii stars are still poorly constrained , mainly because there are no observational data and all our knowledge has to come from numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "although most models do suggest that they can obtain very high masses , there is no consensus on the form of the pop  iii initial mass function ( imf ) , nor on the energy output of pop  iii supernova ( sn ) explosions .",
    "@xcite composed tables of energy and metal yields for massive stars , including pop  iii stars , up to @xmath39 .",
    "these energies are very different from the typical energies released by normal `` population ii '' ( pop  ii ) and `` population i '' ( pop  i ) supernovae , and hence will probably affect the ism in the simulations in a different way .",
    "[ [ model-1 ] ] model 1 + + + + + + +    as a first method to include pop  iii stars , we just assumed pop  iii stars to be star particles with zero metallicity and with masses in the range @xmath40 .",
    "the lower limit was chosen arbitrarily and is close to the upper limit we use for the masses of pop  ii and pop  i stars . as a first approximation",
    ", we only look at the energy output of the pop  iii supernovae and not their metal output . to this end",
    ", we scale up the number of supernova explosions per star particle ( which represents a stellar population ) to match the total energy output of a pop  iii stellar population with the same total mass , but we keep the energy and metal output per supernova fixed .    even in this simple model ,",
    "there are already some uncertainties coming from the uncertainty on the pop  iii imf .",
    "we can assume the same chabrier imf we use for the pop  ii and pop  i stars for the pop  iii stellar population and extrapolate it out to the upper mass limit @xmath39 , but we can also use a flat imf in the mass range @xmath40 , which seems to be in better agreement with numerically found imfs for pop  iii stars @xcite . since the number of massive stars in the latter case will be a lot higher , this will have a major impact on the total energy output of the pop  iii stellar population .",
    "we will call this model `` pop  iii model 1a '' , and parametrize it by the fraction of the total mass of the star particle that consists of high mass stars that will explode as supernovae and each return @xmath41 of energy to the ism . the total energy a star particle pumps into the ism ( over the whole feedback time interval )",
    "is then given by multiplying this parameter with the mass of the stellar particle .",
    "we will consider a model with fraction @xmath42 ( low feedback ) , @xmath43 ( high feedback ) , and @xmath44 ( middle feedback ) .",
    "the high feedback value illustrates the fact that for a flat imf , the total energy emitted by a pop  iii sn is a lot higher than for a snii .",
    "the time interval for this feedback corresponds to the expected lifetime of the lower and upper mass limit stars  : 0.006 to 0.36 myr @xcite .",
    "we also investigate the effect of the lower mass limit for pop  iii stars on the pop  iii energy feedback , by considering a model with lower limit @xmath45 instead of @xmath46 . in this case",
    ", all pop  iii stars will be extremely short - lived , and will deposit a large amount of energy into the ism over a very short time interval ( 0.006 to 0.043 myr ) .",
    "we will call this model `` pop  iii model 1b '' and consider two feedback parameters  : @xmath47 ( low feedback ) , and @xmath48 ( high feedback ) .",
    "[ [ model-2 ] ] model 2 + + + + + + +    a second , more advanced pop  iii model also takes into account the energy radiated away by the pop  iii stars during their stellar lifetime , which is similar to the energy output provided by sw for pop  ii and pop  i stars , but is potentially a lot higher @xcite .",
    "this energy output bridges the very short gap between the birth of the star particle and the onset of pop  iii sn feedback and provides a further early energy input into the ism .",
    "we consider two versions of this model  : a model with high sw energy ( @xmath49 ) and low pop  iii sn feedback ( @xmath50 ) , and a model with low sw energy ( @xmath41 ) and high pop  iii sn feedback ( @xmath51 ) .",

    "we will verify this model as part of our parameter study .",
    "apart from returning the low pop  iii sw feedback and high pop  iii sn feedback to the ism , a pop  iii star particle returns a fraction of 0.45 of its total mass to the surrounding ism .",

    "decreasing the feedback parameter below 0.7 will only shift the btfr to higher baryonic masses , while it is already too high at the high velocity end .",
    "although we could expect this to lead to more realistic final neutral gas masses , it will also lead to excessive stellar masses .",
    "apart from slightly shifting the total stellar mass and the circular velocity to lower values , increasing the feedback parameter does hence not help to produce galaxies that lie on the observational btfr and even has a detrimental effect on the final neutral gas mass .      in section [ subsection_uvb ] and section [ subsection_feedback ] , we discussed the effect of external and internal heating on the resulting btfr for our models .",

    "there is no reason why the feedback strength should vary with time , since temporal changes in energy absorption in the ism are handled by the metallicity dependence of our gas cooling model .",
    "an exception to this are pop  iii stars , which are born from very low metallicity gas early in the simulation and have a different feedback compared to other stars .",
    "since they enrich the ism with their feedback , pop  iii stars will only be born early on in the simulation , which effectively causes the stellar feedback to change over time .",
