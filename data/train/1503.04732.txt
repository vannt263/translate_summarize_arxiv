    "@xmath0 , one of the largest hub in cellular network @xcite , is considered to be one of the most important key regulators of cellular metabolic pathways @xcite , regulates a number of cellular functions @xcite and its dynamics control even the fate of the cell when stress is given to the cell @xcite .",

    "it is followed by mathematical treatment of the model , the numerical simulation results and its discussion in the next section .",
    "we then draw come conclusions based on the results we obtained and discussion on it .",
    "the wnt signaling pathway is authorized by @xmath12-catenin regulation via various intermediate interaction steps ( fig .",
    "1 ) @xcite . in this signal processing",
    ", wnt promotes the synthesis of dishevelled ( dsh ) protein , and then inhibits @xmath20 protein kinase @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 , then interacts with @xmath21 ( with rates @xmath22 and @xmath23 for forward and backward reactions as in fig.1 ) in the presence of @xmath12-catenin to form transient complex which in turn phosphorylates @xmath12-catenin into @xmath12-catenin - p ( with rate rate @xmath24 ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12-catenin - p degraded quickly with rate @xmath25 , on the other hand it is dephosphorylated with rate @xmath26 to form freed @xmath12-catenin and then degraded with a rate @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the free @xmath12-catenin is then transported to nucleus ( @xmath12-catenin - n ) with rate @xmath28 , on the other hand @xmath12-catenin - n is transpoted from nucleus to cytoplasm with another rate @xmath29 . then @xmath12-catenin - n promotes the transcription of set of target genes including maxin ( mrna of axin , specifically homolog axin2 in psm tissue ) at the rate @xmath30 , with rate @xmath31 , and maxin also degrades with a rate @xmath32 @xcite . on",
    "the other hand maxin translates to axin with a rate axin protein which also degrades with a rate @xmath33 .",
    "this mechanism of axin is just like a negative feedback loop which drives the oscillations in the network components .",
    "thus @xmath15 is the essential target of the wnt pathway because it inhibits the wnt signals by degrading the @xmath12-catenin by forming a negative feedback loop @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ]        the wnt pathway communicates with the @xmath0 oscillator @xcite through @xmath20 by formation of a binary complex @xmath34 with the free available @xmath0 at the rate @xmath35 .",
    "then this complex @xmath34 degrades at the rate @xmath36 to the free @xmath0 and @xmath20 proteins @xcite . @xmath0 and @xmath3 regulate each other with feedback mechanism where formation and decay of various intermediate complexes are involved with different rates ( fig .",
    "1 ) as described in table 1 and 2 @xcite .",
    "the freely synthesized nutilin directly interacts with @xmath3 with a rate @xmath37 to form a complex @xmath38 , and then this complex dissociates to release back free nutlin and @xmath3 .",
    "then nutilin indirectly interacts with @xmath0 via @xmath3 by affecting the feedback mechanism between @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "the nutilin then degrades with rate constant @xmath39 .",
    "thus the activated @xmath0 can now go to the nucleus and initiate the transcription of a number of target genes including @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath3 is essential in controlling the concentration of @xmath0 through a positive feedback loop mechanism by making complex @xcite .",
    "we used standard runge - kutta method ( order 4 ) of numerical integration to simulate equation ( refode ) to find the solution of the variables listed in table 1 for the parameter values given in table 2 .",
    "we then analysed the constructed mathematical model to get possible approximate analytical solutions of the variables ( slow variables ) using quasi - steady state approximation .",
    "the cross talk between @xmath0 and wnt via gsk3 subjected to different stress conditions induced by nutlin , as well as axin concentrations available in the system . in order to understand how they regulate each other , we numerically simulated the coupled ordinary differential equations ( [ ode ] ) with the parameters listed in table 2 .",
    "the simulation results for the variable in the model are presented and compared to understand the switching of different oscillating states induced by different stress conditions .",
    "the reason is that these states of the oscillations in wnt network are responsible for different behavior of regular somite formation , and many other periodic phenomena during sometogenesis .",
    "the roles of @xmath15 , @xmath2 , @xmath12-catenin and nutilin on the @xmath0 network dynamics is discussed in the context of the model we presented .",
    "further , the signal processing between the two coupled network modules via the @xmath2 during sometogenesis is studied under the stress @xmath0 generating effect due to @xmath11-@xmath57 . on the other hand",
    ", we also studied the regulation of @xmath0 by wnt due to available axin concentration in the system .",
    "the @xmath0 in @xmath0 regulatory network can be induced stress by the available concentration of stress inducer molecular species , @xmath58 .",
    "the concentration level of @xmath58 is proportional to the creation rate constant of @xmath58 , @xmath59 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . therefore , computationally we can able to monitor the amount of stress induced to @xmath0 by changing the value of parameter @xmath59 and supervising the dynamical behavior of @xmath0 ( fig . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath0 ( fig . 2 upper left panels ) for small values of @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) show single spike due to sudden stress , and due to small @xmath59 values , the dynamics become stabilized indicating normal nature of the system .",
    "then , as the value of @xmath59 increases , @xmath0 dynamics show damped oscillation indicating the inducing oscillation for certain interval of time ( @xmath61 $ ] minutes for @xmath62 ) , and then its dynamics become stabilized .",
    "the time interval of damped oscillation regime depends on the value of @xmath59 and increases as @xmath59 .",
    "this indicates that if the stress given to the system is small , the system first will go to the stress or excited state ( indicated by oscillatory behavior ) , repair back the changes in the system and come back to the normal condition . for sufficiently large values of @xmath59 ( @xmath63 )",
    "the @xmath0 dynamics become sustain oscillation , where the responsed stress is optimal and sustains the stress for @xmath64 .",
    "further increase in the value of @xmath59 ( @xmath65 ) force the sustain oscillation of @xmath0 to damped oscillation whose time interval of damped oscillation decreases as @xmath59 increases .",
    "this indicates that excess stress in @xmath0 due to nutlin may become toxic to the system reflected in @xmath0 dynamics .",
    "if we increase the value of @xmath59 ( @xmath66 ) the @xmath0 dynamics become stabilized .",
    "this may probably the case of apoptosis of the system .",
    "the results obtained are in consistent with the experimental observations which indicates that acetylation of @xmath0 is responsible for its activation and stabilization @xcite .",
    "if we further increase the value of  @xmath59 ,  @xmath0 activation decreases maintaining  @xmath0 stability , but at higher values ( @xmath6735 ) .",
    "[ fig3 ]        the two dimensional plots between @xmath0 and nutlin ( fig . 2 upper right panels ) for different values of @xmath59 show different behaviors of the system , namely stable fixed point , damped oscillation towards a fixed point , sustain oscillation , then damped and stabilized fixed point .",
    "this behaviors show the same behaviors as shown in @xmath0 dynamics for different values of @xmath59 .    similarly , we study the dynamics of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath59 ( fig . 2 lower left panels ) for corresponding values which we took for the case of @xmath0 . in this case",
    "also we found the similar behaviors as we got in @xmath0 case ( fig .",
    "2 ) , namely , stabilized , damped , sustain , then damped and stabilized states for the corresponding values of @xmath59 taken in @xmath0 case .",
    "the two dimensional plots of @xmath2 and nutlin ( fig . 2 lower right hand panels ) show the evidence of the existence of the mentioned states .",
    "now we study the dynamics of axin ( fig . 3 upper left panel ) imparted by stress @xmath0 via @xmath2 induced by nutlin concentration in the system .",
    "the signal of the stress @xmath0 is processed by axin via @xmath2 and reflected the same states in axin dynamics as obtained in @xmath0 .",
    "the axin and @xmath68 dynamics as a function of @xmath59 , as well as two dimensional plots of these two molecules with nutlin are similar qualitatively with the dynamics of stress @xmath0 and @xmath2 ( fig . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "this means that depending on the values of @xmath59 the stress @xmath0 can able to generate and arrest the axin and @xmath68 cycles .",
    "thus the dynamics of axin and @xmath68 can be regulated by @xmath0 and probably can control the wnt oscillator .",
    "this means that @xmath0 regulation has strong impact on wnt oscillation , and regulate various mechanisms during sometogenesis .",
    "[ fig4 ]          the activation of axin occurs after the @xmath69 initiation from the signal received at the membrane . the nutilin synthesis rate ( @xmath59 ) is kept constant in this case ( @xmath70 ) , giving a slight stress to the system . in order to understand how does wnt oscillator regulate @xmath0 , we allow to change axin synthesis rate @xmath71 and see the dynamical behavior of @xmath0 induced by axin , which is one of the most important molecular species in wnt network module .",

    "axin dynamics maintains lowest constant level , showing stabilized state of the axin dynamics ( fig",
    ". 4 lower left panels ) .",
    "the increase in the value of @xmath71 allows the axin dynamics to switch from stabilized state to damped state for certain range of time and then become stabilized .",
    "the co - existence of these two states ( damped and stabilized states ) takes place for a certain range on @xmath71 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "if we increase the value of @xmath71 , the duration of damped oscillation also increases .",
    "the switching of damped state to sustain oscillation state takes place for certain range of @xmath71 , @xmath74 .",
    "further increase in @xmath71 force the sustain oscillation state to damped oscillation state again , where the time interval of damped oscillation becomes smaller as @xmath71 increases .",
    "if we increase @xmath71 value , then axin dynamics landed to stabilized state .",
    "we then show the dynamics of @xmath75 catenin as a function of @xmath71 ( fig .",
    "4 ) which indicates the switching of the three different states driven by @xmath71 . in this case",
    "we could able to find sustain oscillation very quickly indicating that the @xmath75catenin can be quickly switch to stress condition and easily .",
    "similarly , @xmath75catenin can reach second stabilized state ( probably cycle arrest ) quickly and easily as compared to other molecular species .",
    "the dynamical behavior of @xmath75catenin is supported by two dimensional plots of @xmath75catenin and axin ( fig .",
    "3 middle right panels ) which exhibit fixed point oscillations ( corresponding to two stabilized states ) , attractor towards the stable fixed points ( corresponding to two damped oscillations ) , limit cycle ( corresponding to sustain oscillation ) .",
    "now the dynamics of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath71 ( fig . 4 upper left panel ) show that the patterns in the dynamics of molecular species in wnt oscillator are well captured in the @xmath0 dynamics .",
    "the @xmath0 dynamics exhibit the corresponding states , namely , stabilized , damped and sustain oscillation states , as observed in axin and @xmath75catenin as a function of @xmath71 with similar patterns and dynamics .",
    "[ fig5 ]        the important dynamical behaviors those have been captured in @xmath0 dynamics due to change of states in molecular species in wnt oscillator are synchronous in states and time periods of dynamics .",
    "if we look at the dynamics of axin and @xmath75catenin as a function of @xmath71 , we can easily observe two important changes , ( 1 ) change in time period of oscillations of the molecular species , and ( 2 ) change in the pattern of states . the increase in @xmath71 force to decrease the time period of the axin and @xmath75catenin dynamics . at the same time",
    "the switching of the various states takes place .",
    "these changes in the axin and @xmath75catenin are systematically and synchronously well captured in qualitative sense in the @xmath0 dynamics ( fig .",
    "4 ) during the communication of the two @xmath0 and wnt oscillators via @xmath2 .",
    "we now study the impact of interaction of @xmath2 and @xmath0 ( @xmath76 ) on wnt and @xmath0 cross talk driven by nutlin concentration level in the system ( fig .",
    "the rate of interaction of @xmath0 and @xmath2 can modulated by external catalytic action or external stimuli regulating the interaction in the system .",
    "we calculated amplitudes of four molecular species axin , @xmath75catenin , @xmath2 and @xmath77 as a function of @xmath59 for five different values of @xmath76 ( fig .",
    "5 upper two rows ) .",
    "the amplitudes of the molecular species for every values of @xmath78 are calculated by averaging the amplitudes within the interval of time @xmath79 $ ] minutes . from the results we observe three different regimes for each value of @xmath76 : first amplitude death ( ad ) regime ( for small @xmath59 ) ; second finite amplitude or oscillation regime ( or ) ( for moderate @xmath59 ) ; and third amplitude death regime again ( for large @xmath59 ) .",
    "the first ad regime may correspond to normal state ( stable state ) of the system , and second ad regime may correspond to apoptosis ( cycle arrest ) of the system .",
    "further , we calculated maximum values of molecular species axin , @xmath75catenin , @xmath2 and @xmath0 for the correponding values taken above ( fig .",
    "6 lower two rows of plots ) .",
    "the patterns obtained in these plots are similar to the patterns of the amplitude plots of the corresponding molecular species .",
    "[ fig6 ]        in or , the amplitude is finite and increases monotonically as a function of @xmath78 , then reaches a maximum amplitude , after which amplitude decreases slowly and then decreases monotonically .",
    "this is the regime where the system is in activated or stress condition .",
    "it is also to be noted that as @xmath76 increases the amplitude also increases and the range of activated regime also increases .",
    "this means that increasing @xmath76 force the system to get activated quickly and protects the system from next stabilized regime ( cycle arrest or apoptosis regime ) .",
    "therefore , even though increase in nutlin concentration drives the system to apoptosis regime quickly , one can modulate the interaction of @xmath0 and @xmath2 to protect the system from apoptosis upto significant range of nutlin concentration level , so that the system can repair back from toxic due to excess nutlin to come back to normal condition .",
    "now we study the impact of @xmath0 and @xmath2 interaction on the condition of activation of molecular species of both the @xmath0 and wnt oscillators .",
    "we calculated the amplitudes of these molecular species as a function of axin concentration level in the system ( @xmath71 ) ( fig .",
    "6 first two rows ) for the same parameter values as we had taken in the case of calculation of amplitudes of these molecular species with the variation of nutlin concentration in the system . for the same parameter values we also calculated the maxima of these molecular species ( fig .",
    "6 lower two rows ) .",
    "the change in @xmath71 drives the amplitudes of all the molecular species to different oscillation states ( ad , or , ad ) as we have obtain in the case of wnt cycle arrest by @xmath78 variation .",
    "the increase in axin concentration level in the system forces amplitudes of the molecular species variables to pass the trajectories of first ad ( normal condition ) , then or ( stress condition ) and then second ad ( cycle arrest condition ) .",
    "however , in this case the amplitudes of the variables do not change much as a function @xmath71 , but significant change in the range of second ad as a function of @xmath76 .",
    "the results indicate the axin induced @xmath0 cycle arrest , however , interaction of @xmath0 and @xmath2 can able to protect the system from apoptosis upto significant range of @xmath71 so that the system can repair back to its normal condition .      since the direct and exact analytical solution of the set of coupled nonlinear differential equations ( [ ode ] ) , we used quasi steady state approximation @xcite to obtain approximation solution of the system .",

    "we then demonstrate that any other changes in the regulation of the network module , may probably by catalytic reaction or external stimuli which alters the rate of the reaction of a particular reaction , can probably try to protect the system from apoptosis upto certain range of system s condition within which the system can repair back the changes to come back to normal condition .",
    "we attempt to numerically demonstrate this phenomena by allowing the change in the rate constant of @xmath0 and @xmath2 interaction and clearly give a chance to both the @xmath0 and wnt network modules upto certain range of excess concentration levels of nutlin and axin to protect themselves from cycle arrest , namely apoptosis .",
    "this means that one important role of catalytic reaction and external stimuli ( which do not affect the reactions and network but rate of reactions ) is to protect the system from apoptosis or system s failure by giving a chance of repair the failure or defect by itself within the system automatically .",
