    "recently , the mechanism of superconductivity in high-@xmath2 superconductors with feas layers @xcite has been attracting considerable attentions . the superconducting state is realized by introducing carrier into the parent compound , which shows the spin density wave ( sdw ) state at @xmath7k @xcite . in the sdw state , the ordered magnetic moment is @xmath8 and the ordering vector is @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "nmr studies had clearly shown that the singlet superconducting state is realized in iron oxypnictides @xcite .",
    "a fully gapped superconducting state has been determined by the penetration depth measurement @xcite , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite , specific heat measurement @xcite , and so on .    in the first - principle band calculations @xcite , the fermi surfaces in iron oxypnictides",
    "are composed of two hole - like fermi pockets around the @xmath10 point and two electron - like fermi pockets around m@xmath11 points .",
    "the nesting between the hole and electron pockets is expected to give rise to the sdw state in undoped compounds . in doped compounds without sdw order , the antiferromagnetic ( af ) fluctuations with @xmath9",
    "is expected to induce a fully gapped @xmath12-wave state with sign reversal , which is called the @xmath6-wave state @xcite .",
    "moreover , near the sdw boundary , the hall coefficient and nernst signal show prominent anomalous behaviors @xcite , which are similar to those observed in high-@xmath2 cuprates and in ce@xmath13in@xmath14 ( @xmath13=co , rh , ir ) @xcite .",
    "theoretically , these anomalous transport phenomena indicate the existence of strong af fluctuations @xcite . at the same time",
    ", huge residual resistivity far beyond the @xmath12-wave unitary scattering is expected to appear near the sdw boundary theoretically @xcite .    to investigate the pairing symmetry of superconductivity ,",
    "impurity effects on the superconducting state offer us decisive informations . in iron oxypnictide superconductors ,",
    "impurity effect on @xmath2 due to co , ni , or zn substitution for fe sites is very small or absent @xcite .",
    "this result clearly rules out the possibility of line - node superconductivity .",
    "one may also expect that the @xmath12-wave state with sign reversal is also eliminated , since the cooper pair is destroyed by the interband scattering induced by impurities .",
    "however , we have recently shown that @xmath2 is almost unchanged by strong ( unitary ) impurities , since the interband impurity scattering potential @xmath0 is different from the intraband one @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the reason for this unexpected result is that the effective interband scattering is renormalized to zero in the unitary limit except at @xmath5 in the @xmath15-matrix approximation .",
    "therefore , the experimental absence of impurity effect on @xmath2 in iron oxypnictides is well understood in terms of the @xmath6-wave state . on the other hand , @xmath2 will be prominently reduced by short - range weak ( born ) impurities @xcite .",
    "recently , several authors had revealed that in - gap density of states ( dos ) is induced by impurities in the @xmath6-wave state using the born approximation for general value of @xmath16 @xcite , or using the @xmath15-matrix approximation only for @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "they also demonstrated that the relation @xmath18 under @xmath2 , which had been reported by several groups @xcite , can be reproduced by the impurity - induced dos .",
    "however , the assumed impurity parameters ( @xmath19 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) also yields a sizable suppression in @xmath2 according to the analysis in ref .",
    "furthermore , impurity - induced dos should be sensitive to the value of @xmath20 in the unitary scattering regime , as suggested in ref . @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have to study the impurity effects on the dos and @xmath2 for general @xmath20 , and compare their relationships in detail .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the impurity - induced dos and @xmath2 in the @xmath6-wave state using the @xmath15-matrix approximation for general @xmath20 .",
    "we stress that @xmath20 is not unity in iron oxypnictides since hole and electron pockets are not composed of the same @xmath21-orbitals . in the born or intermediate scattering regime , a sizable impurity - induced dos appears for @xmath22 , and therefore @xmath4 may deviate from a simple exponential behavior .",
    "although impurity - induced dos can yield a power - law temperature dependence in @xmath4 @xcite , we find that a sizable suppression in @xmath2 is inevitably accompanied .",
    "the anisotropy in the @xmath6-wave superconducting gap , which had been predicted theoretically @xcite , might be responsible for the power - law temperature dependence of @xmath4 under @xmath2 as discussed in ref .",
    "in contrast , unitary impurities affect both the superconducting dos and @xmath2 only slightly , except at @xmath5 .",
    "as studied in refs . @xcite , the @xmath6-wave state is realized in the two - band bcs model if we introduce the interband repulsive interaction , which represents the af fluctuations due to the interband nesting in iron oxypnictides . in the present paper ,",
    "we study the impurity effect using the @xmath15-matrix approximation for general @xmath23 . in the presence of mass enhancement due to many - body effect , @xmath24",
    ", both the superconducting gap and the impurity effect ( or impurity concentration @xmath19 ) are renormalized by the factor @xmath25 . in the present analysis ,",

    "<S> the sign - reversing fully gapped superconducting state , which is expected to be realized in oxypnictide superconductors , can be prominently affected by nonmagnetic impurities due to the interband scattering of cooper pairs . </S>",
    "<S> we study this problem based on the isotropic two - band bcs model : in oxypnictide superconductors , the interband impurity scattering @xmath0 is not equal to the intraband one @xmath1 . in the born scattering regime , </S>",
    "<S> the reduction in @xmath2 is sizable and the impurity - induced density of states ( dos ) is prominent if @xmath3 , due to the interband scattering . </S>",
    "<S> although impurity - induced dos can yield a power - law temperature dependence in @xmath4 , a sizable suppression in @xmath2 is inevitably accompanied . in the unitary scattering regime , in contrast , impurity effect is very small for both @xmath2 and dos except at @xmath5 . by comparing theory and experiments </S>",
    "<S> , we expect that the degree of anisotropy in the @xmath6-wave gap function strongly depends on compounds . </S>"
