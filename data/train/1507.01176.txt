    "vicinal crowders create a rough energy landscape for the self - diffusion and the hopping of a given crowder particle . as the mmc fraction @xmath0 increases , the binding events give rise to more a prolonged particle aggregation and reduced self - diffusivity . above a critical mmc fraction",
