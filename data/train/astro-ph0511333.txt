    "the galactic center ( gc ) of our galaxy found in 1974 as a strong radio source called sgr a@xmath10 is the site a supermassive black hole weighing 2.6 millions solar mass is present ( e.g. melia and falcke 2001 ) .",
    "morever the total mass of stars enclosing the inner 20 pc of the galaxy is @xmath11 m@xmath12 , or @xmath13% of the galactic stellar mass ( baganoff et al .",
    "therefore , the x - ray observations of the galactic center can potentially reveal accreting black holes and neutron stars . during five years of chandra observations , baganoff et al . identified seven x - ray transients located within 20 pc of sgr a@xmath10 .",
    "remarkably four of these transients lie within only 1 pc of sgr a@xmath10 ( muno et al .",
    "this implies that , compared to the numbers of similar systems located between 1 and 20 pc , transients are over - abundant by a factor of @xmath14 per unit stellar mass within 1 pc of sgr a@xmath10 .",
    "it is also now a subject of intense activity due to the possible presence of a dark matter cusp inside the galactic center .",
    "numerous space missions have observed the center of our galaxy in radio , infrared , x and @xmath15 rays .",
    "thanks to these measurements we have a more precise picture of this region . the center of our galaxy presents the characteristic that there is a strong activity both in x and @xmath15 rays . a recent hess ( high energy stereoscopic system ) experiment reports a detection of very high energy gamma rays from the galactic center within @xmath16 of sgr a@xmath10 . the flux above 165 gev is order of @xmath17 m@xmath18 s@xmath2 and consistent with a luminosity of @xmath19 ergs s@xmath2 ( aharonian , et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the most intense line of our galaxy is coming also from gc : the 511 kev annihilation line .",
    "balloon flight observations reported in 1972 showed first evidence for the existence of an annihilation line from the galactic center region ( johnson , harnden & haymes 1972 ; see also johnson & haymes , 1973 ) .",
    "since that time the galactic center has been the object of intense observations from space missions and balloon experiments ( leventhal , maccallum & stang 1978 ; purcell et al .",

    "the observed emission of the brightest gamma - ray line in our galaxy is due to two separate sources : a diffuse one and a point source near the galactic center .",
    "for the point source we use the value given by integral from recent observations ( churazov et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the point source line flux is : @xmath20  ph  @xmath1  s@xmath2 , for which the corresponding luminosity of the line emission is about @xmath21 ergs  s@xmath2 for the distance of about 8 kpc",
    ". then the positron sources are produced at a rate given by : @xmath22s@xmath2 , where @xmath23 is the distance expressed in unit of 8 kpc .",
    "this observation is in a good agreement with the previous measurements and is well fitted by a gaussian with the full width at half maximum of @xmath24 10 degrees , with a 2 @xmath25 confidence interval of 6 - 18 degrees.the integral measurement providing the line width of @xmath26 kev exlcudes velocity @xmath27 of the interstellar medium ( ism ) greater than @xmath28 km s@xmath2 , i.e. @xmath29 .",
    "several possible sources of the observed line related to the positron sources have been proposed .",
    "for example , dermer & skibo ( 1997 ) suggest that these sources could be associated with galactic fountains of radioactive elements ejected from supernova activity in the galactic center .",
    "boehm , fayet & silk ( 2004 ) offer an alternative explanation that the observed annihilation line could be related to the annihilation of dark light matter particles into @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , guessoum , jean & gillard ( 2005 ) present the list of the main processes that led to the positron production .",
    "they are : ( i ) .",
    "the @xmath31 decay of a radioactive nucleous which is widespread in the explosive and/or hydrostatic nucleosynthesis enviroments of novae , supernovae , wolf - rayet , and asymptotic giant branch stars , ( ii ) . @xmath32 decay into @xmath33 and gives off a positron taking place where the pion is produced in collisions of highly energetic ( @xmath34 mev ) cosmic rays with interstellar material , ( iii ) .",
    "pair production by interaction of an electron with a strong magnetic field and ( iv ) the process of the photon - photon pair production which requires photons of high energies occuring in the enviroment of luminous compact objects , black holes , active nuclei ( agn ) an etc .",
    "thus one can not exclude _ that pair production is a result of the interaction of x - ray and @xmath35 emission in the very compact shell near galactic center_.    x - ray observations of the galactic center have been made with several instruments ( watson et al .",

    "the japanese satellite ginga having detected k@xmath38 lines from highly ionized iron , found a large amount of hot plasma which is strongly concentrated towards the galactic center ( koyama et al .",

    "the asca image ( tanaka et al . 1995 ) has revealed extended diffuse emission over the galactic center region .",
    "the observed spectrum shows the k@xmath39 lines from highly - ionized ions of silicon , sulphur , argon , calcium , in addition to the high - ionization iron lines .",

    "it appears that the x - ray irradiating spectrum of the cloud is , in fact , not free - free , ( as early proposed irradiating spectrum , see above ) and it is rather quite hard , extending to over 100 kev and probably a power law with photon index 1.8 .",
    "revnivtsev et al",
    ". concluded that 300 - 400 years ago sgr a@xmath10 was a low luminosity ( of @xmath49 ergs s@xmath2 at 2 - 200 kev ) agn with characteristic hard x - ray comptonization spectrum with photon index of about 1.8 and plasma temperature is about 50 kev .",
    "the @xmath35 emission between 1 mev and 30 mev has been measured by comptel .",

    "5 we present arguments for the origin of the @xmath51 mev emission near galactic center .",
    "we discuss our results in  6 and we make our final conclusions in  7 .",
    "we assume that the photon density of x - ray photons emitted by the inner shell near the central bh within @xmath52 @xmath53 ( schwarzschild radii ) is described by the following distribution over radius @xmath54 ( see fig . 1 for the geometrical description of the model ) @xmath55 where @xmath56 is x - ray luminosity of the central source per kev ( x - ray energy spectrum )",

    "to compute the positron flux one needs the x and @xmath87 ray energy spectra , @xmath56 and @xmath65 respectively .",
    "we will use for the total x - ray and @xmath15 luminosities of the inner gc region , @xmath88 ergs s@xmath2 and @xmath89 ergs s@xmath2 respectively ( see a review of the observations in the introduction ) .",
    "we assume that the @xmath35 radiation emanates from a optically thick medium and consequently the emergent spectrum has a blackbody like shape that color temperature @xmath90 mev ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . then for a normalization constant @xmath91 we have an equation as follows @xmath92 where @xmath93 . for the x - ray photons",
    ", we assume a power law with an exponential cutoff @xmath94 where @xmath95 , @xmath96 kev , the spectral index @xmath97 and @xmath98 is the normalization constant . from the previous section we saw that the process of pair creation is driven by the cross section given by equation ( 6 ) . the energy dependence , represented by the parameter @xmath99 can be expressed using the dimesionless energies @xmath95 and @xmath100 , namely @xmath77^{1/2 } = [ 1 - 3.26/xy]^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "then the formula for the pair flux @xmath101 can be modified using the variables @xmath102 and @xmath103 as follows @xmath104 we compute this double integral and obtain the following result : @xmath105 to reproduce the value of @xmath106s@xmath2 for the positrons rate , one needs a value of the radius @xmath60 , given by : @xmath107    it is worth noting that the intrinsic pair flux @xmath108 s@xmath2 , formed as a result of @xmath109 interaction ( to calculate this flux one should replace @xmath110 by @xmath111 in formula 14 ) in this @xmath35emission region of size @xmath112 cm , is six orders of magnitude less than the pair flux @xmath113 s@xmath2 required to reproduce the observed annihilation line strength .",
    "a positron , @xmath7 may collide with an electron @xmath114 , to produce two gamma ray photons according to the reaction @xmath115 . before decaying",
    ", the positron in the free space interacts with an electron and forms the positronium , a bound state with lifetime of order of @xmath116 s. then particles annihilate into two or three photons .",
    "one photon will have a high energy and , if the electron is at rest ; the other photon will have an energy of the order @xmath117 kev . in our calculations",
    "we assume that most of the produced positrons are thermalized in the surrounding thermal plasma and thus we can consider the annihilation of thermal positrons at a temperature of order @xmath118 k , i.e. @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the thermal velocity of electrons .",
    "in fact , the recent integral observations of 511 kev annihilation line ( churazov et al . 2005 ) exclude velocity of the interstellar medium greater than @xmath121 . for @xmath122 , the cross - section @xmath25 , for positron annihilation with a free electron at rest",

    ", they constructed annihilation spectra of ism .    the fair question is how far the positrons of energy about one mev can travel from the galactic central region to be annihilated . in order to answer to this question one has to compare the diffusion ( travel ) time with the energy loss ( thermalization ) time with taking into the main energy loss mechanisms . in general terms , the particle diffusion is related to escape of a magnetized turbulent plasma .",
    "jean et al .",
    "( 2005 ) present a spectral analyzis of the @xmath125 annihilation emission from the gc region based on the first year of measurements made with the spectrometer spi of the integral mission .",
    "they also analyze the positron diffusion propagation in the gc region in detail .",
    "the quasilinear diffusion coefficient the diffusion coefficient @xmath126 ( melrose 1980 ) can be expressed as : @xmath127 with @xmath128 the bohm diffusion coefficient , @xmath129 is the maximum scale of the turbulence , @xmath130 for a kolmogorov turbulent spectrum , @xmath131 is relative perturbation of the magnetic field pressure which is often approximated to 1 , @xmath27 is the positron velocity and @xmath132 is the larmor radius ( gyroradius ) @xmath133 @xmath134 is the positron ( electron ) charge , @xmath135 is the magnetic field strength , @xmath136^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "the maximum scale @xmath129 was estimated to be @xmath137 pc from the measurements of ism turbulence ( armstrong et al . 1995 ) .",
    "recently the ( mean ) magnetic field strength in the gc region was measured by la rosa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , hereafter lar05 , to be @xmath6 @xmath81 g .",
    "lar05 have used the very large array in all four configurations to image the gc region at 74 mhz .",
    "the resulting image of large scale ( @xmath138 ) of nonthermal synchrotron emission presented in lar05 has a resolution of @xmath139 . at distance of 8 kpc",
    "the angular scales of @xmath138 corresponds to region @xmath140 pc and that of @xmath139 corresponds to 0.09 pc .",
    "it has be noted that in the past several authors ( see morris & serabyn et al .",
    "1996 and references therein ) estimated magnetic fields values of @xmath141 g in the gc region .",
    "this is 2 orders of magnitude larger than the value ( @xmath6 @xmath81 g ) obtained by lar05 .",
    "thus for the mean b of @xmath124 @xmath81 g and for 1 mev positrons @xmath142 @xmath143s@xmath2 . the low limit time scale for 1 mev positrons to thermalize in a the @xmath144 @xmath81 g , and   @xmath145 cm @xmath146 density region due to ionization , bremsstrahlung , synchrotron and other processes is @xmath147 years",
    ". then the distance travelled by diffusion in a time of @xmath148 years ( slowing down time plus annihilation time in the standard grain model ) is @xmath149 which is much greater than typical half - size of the hot gc region .",
    "the volume filling factor of the hot gc region 0.72 is highest among all phases of the galactic bulge ( see more details of these estimates in jean et al . 2005 ) . using the spectral data and positron propagation analysis jean et al .",
    "( 2005 ) _ come to conclusion that the sources of annihilation emission are diffusively distributed over the galaxy_. they also explain that the lack of annihilation emission from the gc hot gas is due to its low density , which allows positrons to escape this phase .",
    "it is worth noting liu , petrosian & melia ( 2004 ) find that an outflow of low energy electrons of order 1 mev are distributed over a spatially larger scale than that of the bh inner region ( see more discussion of their work in section 6.2 ) .",
    "namely , the escape time of these electrons is more than a factor of 2 shorter than the time scales for acceleration and losses .    on the hand",
    "one can argue that the positrons can be diffusely trapped , thermalized and annihilated in the region that size @xmath150 is of order a few parsec and where the magnetic field can be much higher than @xmath6 @xmath81 g .",
    "melia & falcke ( 2001 ) suggest that out to @xmath151 pc ( essentially inside the cavity surrounded by the circumnuclear disk ) , the field is turbulent ( matching the turbulent plasma generated by wind - wind interactions from the wolf - rayet and o / b stars in this region ) , can be as high as @xmath152 mg .",
    "so the problem is that the gyroradius of the electrons and positrons produced in gamma - gamma interactions , will be far smaller than the region over which the positrons are believed to be annihilating .",
    "consequently , the pairs should be radiating profusely via synchrotron , bremsstrahlung , and inverse compton .",
    "the photon energy density in this region is about @xmath153 ev cm@xmath146 . to obtain this number",
    "we assume that the bolometric luminosity of the source in the galactic center is of order @xmath155 erg s@xmath2 ( see e.g. narayan et al .",
    "thus the derived magnetic strength @xmath156 using equipartition between photons and magnetic field energies is about @xmath124 @xmath81 g .",
    "for such a low magnetic field we have already demonstrated that the positrons can escape from the gc region .",
    "in fact , longair ( 1994 ) derived the minimum magnetic energy requirement for a given luminosity @xmath157 and photon volume v per unit time ( in our case @xmath158 .",
    "he shows that @xmath159 which value is higher than that obtained using relation @xmath160 .",
    "but the ratio of @xmath161 is not orders of magnitude .",
    "the difference of the indicies of ratio @xmath162 is @xmath163 vs @xmath164 .",
    "furthermore longair found that the magnetic field strength , @xmath165 , corresponds to approximate equality of the energies in the particles and magnetic field .",
    "lar05 confirm this conclusion .",
    "they show that the mean magnetic field in the gc region @xmath124 @xmath81 g inferred from their observations is consistent with the particle energy density of @xmath166 ev found in cosmic - ray data .",
    "the turbulent diffusion time scale @xmath167 is not determined by the magnetic field only .",
    "in fact for @xmath130 the diffusion coefficient @xmath126 is proportional to @xmath168 ( see eq.[d_ql ] ) .",
    "even if the magnetic field is about @xmath153 mg the diffusion coefficient @xmath126 decreases by factor 4.6 only , namely @xmath169 @xmath143s@xmath2 .",
    "the related difussion time through this region @xmath170 is about @xmath171 years which is much less than the thermalization and annihilation time @xmath118 years .",
    "one of the possible origins for mev - emission is a disk emission from mass accretion by small mass black holes ( smmbhs ) .",

    "the gravitation attraction of the black hole in the galactic center causes a substantial mass accretion in its proximity .",
    "this accretion flow passing through smmbh which are probably distributed uniformly around the central black hole , provides enough material for mass supply of the smmbh objects .",
    "sgr a@xmath10 , the massive bh in the galactic center was recently found to be surrounded by a cluster of young , massive stars . over the past year , three of these stars named so-2 , so-16 and so-19 by ghez et al ( 2004 ) and schodel et al ( 2003 ) are at @xmath190 schwarzschild radii from the central black hole .",
    "it was also found that these stars can be classified as o stars of the main sequence ( ghez et al .",

    "consequently , _ we show how the small mass black holes could be exposed when there is enough material around them_.",
    "revnivtsev et al .

    "we have calculated the pair creation using the inferred luminosity and the inferred spectrum that is a power - law photon spectrum of index 1.8 with an exponential cutoff at 100 kev .",
    "in fact , this is a typical spectrum of bh sources at low / hard state which is presumably a result of comptonization of the soft ( disk ) radiation in the hot electrons of temperature 50 kev in compton cloud around central bh .",
    "it has already been shown that the spectral shape in the low hard state is independent of the luminosity ( e.g. laurent & titarchuk 1999 , titarchuk & fiorito 2004 ) .",
    "we can propose that sgr a * is now in a quiescent state , presumably a result of the gravitational energy release in the advection dominated flow ( see e.g narayan & yi 1994 ) .",
    "the luminosity of the x - ray spectrum of the x - ray source igr j17475 - 2822 does not change since granat / art - p and asca era , i.e. during last 10 years .",
    "the clear match of asca / gis , granat / art - p and integral / ibis ( fig .",
    "2 , revnivtsev et al .",
    "2004 ) strongly supports this claim .",
    "thus the proposed incident spectrum emanating from sgr a * in the past ( 300 years ago ) should not be vary either during the period at least of 10 years .",
    "it means that the inferred e+e- rate should be quite stable during the same period .",
    "the constraints on the `` breathtaking variability on a time scale of only several hundred years '' was proposed by sunyaev et al .",
    "they argue that x - ray echo from sgr b2 should be delayed by 300 - 400 years relative to the direct signal from sgr a@xmath10 due to the light travel time from sgr a@xmath10 to sgr b2 .",
    "one can put the fair question regarding such a short recurrence time for the spectral transition , as 300 - 400 years for a black hole of mass @xmath207 solar masses .    on",
    "the other hand one can suggest the more likely scenario for irradiating sgr b2 was the interaction between the supernova remnant , we now see as sgr a east and the @xmath208 km s@xmath2 molecular cloud behind sgr a@xmath10 , rather than sgr a@xmath10 itself .",
    "the luminosity , time scale , and spectrum all fit the requirements rather well , so the need for a high x - ray activity in sgr a@xmath10 can be weaker now .",
    "this effect of supenova ( sn ) ejecta and its interactions with molecular clouds proposed by bykov ( 2002 , 2003 ) is recently discussed in the literature ( see e.g. muno et al .",
    "2004b , and park et al .",
    "one can be right that `` the luminosity , time scale , and spectrum all fit the requirements rather well '' .",
    "however park et al . pointed out that although the sn ejecta contribution to the observed neutral fe line emission appears to be plausible , they noted a caveat , that nonthermal radio emission features have not been reported in the northeast regions of sgr a@xmath10 .",
    "this absence of nonthermal radio features is admittedly a difficult problem in terms of the snr interpretation .",
    "it means that the supernova ejecta model needs the nonthermal distribution of electrons in order to explain the hard x - ray energy spectrum of the sgr b2 molecular cloud ( revnivtsev et al . 2004 ) .",
    "we want to emphasize once again that the spectrum seen from sgr b2 is a typical spectrum of the low / hard state seen in many bh sources .",
    "it has already been proven long ago ( see e.g. sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ) that this hard spectrum is a result of thermal comptonization of soft ( disk ) photons in the hot compton cloud surrounding the central part of a bh .",
    "thus one does not need any fine tuning or nonthermal electron distribution to produce such a spectrum , because in the outskirts of the gc bh there are plenty of molecular clouds , and we should see the effect of the reflection of the bh x - ray spectrum from these configurations .",
    "thus the spectra of molecular clouds are naturally formed as a result of reflection of bh emission from molecular clouds .      in connection with the previous points",
    ", one can raise a question related to expected rapid variability in the @xmath209 annihilation line flux for such a compact bh region .",
    "however the observations over several decades seem to not show any variability at all .",
    "it is correct to say that the variability in the @xmath209 annihilation line flux would be quite high if this line was formed in the compact central region .",
    "however , we propose that the pairs are produced in this compact region and only then do they propagate through the galaxy and the e+e- annihilation line is formed through the galaxy .",
    "thus variability of the e+e- annihilation line flux is related to the scale of a few kpc and it is not by chance that observations over several decades seem to not show any variability at all .",
    "we infer that the @xmath24mev gamma ray region , where the pairs are created due to x - ray illuminations by the central source , is quite compact .",
    "its radius is @xmath112 cm .",
    "this region within @xmath210 cm , is consistent with the comptel map ( schonfelder et al .",
    "2000 , strong et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the full sky intensity map , longtitude and latitude profiles for 1 - 3 , 3 - 10 and 10 - 30 mev show the strong peaks within a few degrees near gc . however , the spatial resolution of the comptel map is not better than one degree and thus the compact region of @xmath211 cm can not be resolved in comptel map .",
    "it is worth noting that strong & moskalenko ( 1999 ) argue that there is an unresolved point - source population in the inner galaxy and that this source is an important contribution to the emission around 10 mev .",
    "producing @xmath212 s@xmath2 ( or more , depending on the duty cycle ) has consequences beyond simply calculating the annihilation rate .",
    "the region surrounding sgr a@xmath10 is magnetized , with magnetic field strength @xmath135 of order 10 g inside @xmath204 cm . out to @xmath151 pc",
    "the field is turbulent ( matching the turbulent plasma generated by wind - wind interactions from the wolf - rayet and o / b stars in this region ) .",
    "melia & falcke ( 2001 ) have suggested that the magnetic field strength of this region should be in the range of @xmath152 mg .",
    "in section 4.2 we review the positron propagation in the galactic center region and we find the positrons can pass through there .",
    "consequently the sources of annihilation emission are presumably distributed over the galaxy .",
    "recently liu , petrosian & melia ( 2004 ) , hereafter lpm04 , formulated and solved the propagation and acceleration problem in the turbulent magnetized plasma for a given pair flux @xmath213 , magnetic field strength @xmath135 , plasma interaction time @xmath214 , density @xmath215 , the size of the acceleration site @xmath60 and particle distribution of the background plasma .. they showed that acceleration of electrons by plasma wave turbulence in hot gas in the inner - most part of the black hole reasonably account for sgr a@xmath10 s millimeter and shorter wavelength emission in the quiescent state and for the infrared and x - ray flares . in their model",
    "a ( @xmath216 s@xmath2 , @xmath217 g ) they found the power carried away by accelerated electrons , with @xmath218 , is about @xmath219 ergs s@xmath2 ; which is more than enough to power observed radio emission , whose liminosity of @xmath220 ergs s@xmath2 . for the pair flux of order",
    "@xmath106 s@xmath2 , the `` collateral '' spectrum ( and flux ) arising from these particles is very consistent with sgr a@xmath10 s millimeter and shorter wavelength emission in the quiescent state and for the infrared and x - ray flares ( lpm04 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the low energy electron flux @xmath221 calculated by lpm04 , is comparable with the injected flux @xmath213 .",
    "it means that a significant fraction of the low enery electrons escapes from this region without any noticeable acceleration .",
    "in fact , the escape time of low energy electrons is more than a factor of 2 shorter than the time scales for acceleration and losses .",
    "the exact value of the electron flux depends on the model assumptions ( see lpm04 ) ; and thus these theoretical uncertainties of the flux estimate ( within a factor of a few ) are unavoidable .",
    "the lpm04 s model also suggested that an outflow of high energy electrons ( liu & melia 2002 ) are distributed over a spatially larger scale than that of the bh inner region .",
    "finally the escaping high energy electron gas ( cooled through the radiation ) could form the annihilation line emission in the large scale of the galaxy .",
    "the lpm04 s injected flux @xmath222 s@xmath2 , is related to the mass accretion rate of order @xmath223 of the eddington value ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "if the pairs are accelerated to @xmath218 then their energy would be enough to power the observed radio emission whose luminosity is about @xmath220 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "it is worth noting that within our model , the same flux of pairs ( @xmath222 s@xmath2 ) is generated in the smmbh site as a result of x - ray illumination emitted by surrounding material .",
    "if at the present time the x - ray flux is of order @xmath224 erg s@xmath2 , then the pair flux would be @xmath225 s@xmath2 .",
    "dark matter is a long standing puzzle starting from le verrier with his discovery of neptune in 1846 as a perturbation of uranus ( le verrier 1846 ) .",
    "our galaxy is surrounded by an extended halo of unseen material .",
    "so far undetected , that dark matter induces a flat rotation curve in the galactic plane ( van albada & sancisi 1986 ) .",
    "its presence has been noticed since many decades ( see oort 1932 ) . however , its nature is still unknown .",
    "the dark matter problem consists simply , in the existence of invisible mass showing its presence by gravitational effects .",
    "now , it is widely accepted that dark matter exists .",
    "in fact , there is evidence for dark matter on scales from galaxy to the cluster of galaxies and to the whole universe itself .",
    "zwicky ( 1937 ) measured the dispersion velocity in the coma cluster and found that the dynamical mass was hundred times more than the luminosity mass .",
    "moreover , the dark matter seems essential : the growth of structure in the universe by hierachical merging of the dark matter halo is a master piece of moderm cosmology .",
    "recently , wmap has established the presence of non baryonic dark matter with the density reported in terms of critical density of order @xmath226 .",
    "this is now the standard value of the modern cosmology for dark matter density .    on the galactic scale , one can interprete the rotation curve measurements by the presence of the dark matter halo and then determine the mass density profile of this distribution .",
    "the average density is @xmath227 .",
    "the core of this halo seems to be extremely packed . in the galactic center , numerical simulations of structure formation in the non - linear regime have shown the presence of a singular power law cusp @xmath228 , where @xmath229 and @xmath230 is the dark matter density at radius @xmath231 pc ( gnedin & primack 2004 ) .",
    "the central density @xmath232 is not uniquely determined and its value depends on models and it varies from 60 to 600 @xmath233 pc@xmath146 . on the other hand up to now there is no identification for it despite the large number of candidates proposed from masses in the range between @xmath223 ev to @xmath234 .    while there is no a priori reason to expect that massive compact halo objects ( machos ) in the mass range @xmath235 comprise a significant fraction of the density of the universe ,",
    "neither is there any definitive argument ruling them out .",
    "nemiroff & gould ( 1995 ) and marani et al .",
    "( 1999 ) discuss the possibility of identification of smmbhs by gravitational lensing .",
    "the basic idea is to study the deflection of light by measuring the amplification due to gravitational bending of compact objects . for black hole mass in the range @xmath236 to @xmath237 ,",
    "the expected image separation is of order of @xmath238 arcseconds and the average time separation between the images is order of @xmath239 s. they applied this delay as an interference process using gamma ray bursters . on the other hand ,",
    "the absolute value of the light deflection by small black holes is extremely small @xmath240 , where r is the characteristic distance in the galaxy and therefore not observable .",
    "it is easy to show that the optical depth for the photons scattering at small angles by smmbh is small , ( @xmath241 ) and consequently the light multiple scattering by the small black holes effect is also ruled out .",
    "the supersymmetry theory as an extension of the standard model , predicts that one stable particle should be around today as a cosmological relic . among these new particles , the neutralinos ,",
    "could be the dark matter .",
    "if the dark matter halo of our galaxy is made up of such particles , they will annihilate each other into fermion - antifermions pairs , and this will produce stable particles which could be detected as anti - protons , electrons and photons . another way is to look for direct detection via laboratory experiments .",
    "such new particles are scrutinized by direct and indirect searches since more than ten years .",
    "our galaxy is indeed a subject of intense activities because it could be a direct search for dark matter in studying astrophysical signatures .    among all the signatures , our galaxy presents three strong signatures in x - ray , @xmath35ray backgounds and a typical @xmath242 annihilation source in the galactic center . among the other possibilities ,",
    "the micro - lensing searches have been developed and used to probe the dark matter halo of our galaxy ( see above ) .",
    "the possibility that the halo could be made of primordial black holes is not ruled out by observations .",
    "recently , seto and cooray ( 2004 ) discussed also the future possibility of searching dark matter candidates using the space - based gravitationnal wave detectors .",
    "they used this idea to test the possibility that the halo could be made of primordial black holes . according to hawking predictions such primordial black holes will not suffer evaporation",
    "if their mass is greater than @xmath243 g.    while the consequences of evaporating black holes has been widely analyzed in terms of particles production , the case for stable smmbhs s has not been considered so far . in literature , the problem is analyzed generically and the mass range used are often very large from @xmath5 g to @xmath206 g.",
    "in this paper , we show that there is a particular black hole mass which is very interesting for the dark matter problem .",
    "this mass of order of @xmath5 g , corresponds to a typical schwarzschild radius proton size order .",
    "we explore this possibility in the light of existing galactic diffuse x and @xmath15 backgrounds and with the strong source of annihilation lines at 511 kev in the galactic center . our approach is to find a natural explanation of such astrophysical backgrounds within an astrophysical dark matter scenario .",
    "we also offer a model for the origin of the annihilation line appearance in the our galaxy which has been detected in several balloon and space experiments .",
    "we combine x - rays and @xmath15-observations of the galactic center region to show that pair production can be a result of interactions of x - rays and gamma photons emitted in this region .",
    "pairs production strongly depends on the compactness of the x - rays and @xmath15 emission region which is determined by x - rays and @xmath15 luminosity and size of the region .    for velocity of the interstellar medium of much less than @xmath244 cm s@xmath2 and the value of density column a few times @xmath245 , the optical depth for 511 kev line is more than one .",
    "we found for the observed x - rays and @xmath15 luminosities and for the observed annihilation lines flux , the size of the x - ray and @xmath15 emission area is @xmath246 cm .",
    "this size is consistent with the size of the area where the ob stars supply sufficient amount of fuel required for the x - rays and @xmath15 emissions from the galactic center region .",
    "if we compute the total black hole mass inside this region of radius r=@xmath247 pc , we obtain that this mass is about two solar masses .",
    "we can then naturally ask if smmbhs can be a candidate for dark matter as already proposed in literature ( e.g. nemiroff & gould 1995 , marani et al .",
    "it is interesting to compare this number to the dark matter mass computed using the singular power law cusp @xmath228 often used in the dark matter model for the galactic center ( see moore et al .",
    "1998 and gnedin & primack 2004 ) .",
    "we found that with a set of parameters ( @xmath248 pc@xmath146 , @xmath249 pc , @xmath250 ) , we can obtain a mass of @xmath251 inside the same radius r , which is compatible to our number within a factor of a few .",

    "( 2004b ) using a deep chandra observations study to detail the origin of the point like sources near the galactic center .",
    "possibly a single population of sources may dominate in this cluster .",
    "there are certainly many classes of objects present in this set of faint sources .",
    "we may suggest that some part of x - ray and @xmath35radiation of the galactic center , can originate in accreting flows into smmbhs ( that are really faint sources with their bolometric luminosity @xmath253 ergs s@xmath2 ) in which outer parts of flow emit x - rays and the innermost part of the flow emit @xmath35rays .",

    "<S> we suggest that the annihilation radiation can be an observational consequence of the interaction of the accretion disk radiation of the small mass black holes ( smmbhs ) with x - ray radiation in the galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> this is probably the only way to identify and observe these smmbhs . </S>"
