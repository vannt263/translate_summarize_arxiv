    "since the discovery that a non - hermitian hamiltonian having simultaneous parity - time ( @xmath2 ) symmetry  has an entirely real quantum - mechanical energy spectrum @xcite , there has been an intense effort to establish a @xmath2-symmetric quantum theory as a complex extension of the conventional quantum mechanics a.m , a.m36,jones , bender 99,dorey 01,bender 02 .",
    "although there have been no experiments to show clearly and definitively that quantum systems defined by non - hermitian @xmath2-symmetric hamiltonians do exist in nature , many  models have been proposed to verify theorems and perform numerical and asymptotic analysis ( for a recent review , see @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "however it is not clear whether non - hermitian hamiltonians describe real physics or are just unrealistic mathematical objects .",
