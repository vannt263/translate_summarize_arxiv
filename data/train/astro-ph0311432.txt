    "the origin and evolution of structures in the universe can be suitably understood within the hierarchical scenario . in such schemes ,",
    "present - day systems are the result of the aggregation of several sub - structures , and in particular , satellite galaxies can contribute significantly as building blocks of galaxy formation .",
    "however , present - day systems of satellites have evolved since their formation ; and therefore the observations of such systems can provide invaluable information on the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "there are several works that explore the characteristics of systems of satellites .",
    "holmberg ( 1969 ) found that the distribution of galaxy satellites presents a lack of objects within @xmath2 of the primary disk plane ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "he searched for companions of nearby bright disk galaxies ( the primaries ) within 50 kpc of projected separation ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "his sample was composed of 218 satellites including both physical systems and interlopers that contaminated his photometrically selected sample .",
    "he found 45 objects within @xmath3 while 173 had @xmath5 .",
    "if the position angles relative to the primary plane are homogeneously distributed , then the number expected within @xmath3 would be @xmath6 73 . after removing contamination by presumed interlopers ( which are expected to be distributed isotropically ) he concluded that there were no physical objects with @xmath3 .",
    "the results remained controversial since valtonen et al .",
    "( 1978 ) found an excess of compact satellites with small angles relatives to the primary disk .",
    "based on this work , byrd et al .",
    "( 1987 ) argued that the anisotropy of the holmberg sample was mainly due to selection effects for he may have not considered these compact dwarf objects .",
    "the authors proposed a dynamical stripping of the gas content of the satellite as a possible explanation for the excess of such objects near the primary plane .",
    "some years later , the problem was investigated again in a statistical way by zaritsky et al .",
    "( 1997 ) using redshift data .",
    "they selected a sample of 115 satellites of 69 nearby primaries , these satellites have a maximum projected separation @xmath7 kpc .",
    "these authors could not confirm the holmberg effect in the inner 50 kpc since they had few objects at this distance , but they found a similar anisotropy effect with reliable statistical significance at larger separations , @xmath8 kpc .",
    "one simple starting point to approach this problem is to assume an isotropic initial distribution of satellites and that evolution generates the observed anisotropies .",
    "this scenario has been explored by quinn @xmath9 goodman ( 1986 ) , who found that anisotropy in the distribution of satellite positions is not efficiently produced by dynamical evolution , even at small separation , @xmath10 kpc .    on the other hand , numerical simulations like those carried out by abadi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) indicate that , in a hierarchical scenario , the formation of disks involve substantial accretion of satellites which strongly influence the angular momentum vector and therefore the primary plane .",
    "thus , observed anisotropies in the distribution of the remaining satellites could be a direct consequence of this process .",
    "in addition to this work , pearrubia et al .",
    "( 2002 ) also based on numerical simulations , established that the time interval before the satellite disruption strongly depends on the dark matter halo shape , the initial orbital eccentricities and inclinations , and on the mass fraction of satellites relative to the primary .",
    "our work aims to search for anisotropies of the angular distribution of satellites relative to the primary plane as well as exploring the possible dependence on satellites properties .",
    "our analysis is based on the study of an unprecedentedly large statistical sample extracted from the 2df galaxy redshift survey . in section 2",
    "we present the data and selection criteria , in section 3 we show the main results , and in section 4 we summarise our conclusions .",
    "the largest complete redshift survey available to date is the 2dfgrs which comprises information of objects on approximately 1500 square degrees of the sky in the north ( ngc ) and south ( sgc ) strips , and in several random fields .",
    "this catalogue has been obtained with the multifibre technology at the anglo - australian observatory , and provides photometric and spectroscopic data for 232155 galaxies with magnitudes @xmath11 .",
    "it contains positions , magnitudes ( in @xmath12 and r band ) , eccentricities , position angles , redshifts ( well determined for 221414 galaxies ) and the spectral classification through the @xmath1 parameter ( which has a high confidence for objects with @xmath13 ) .",
    "the selection criteria adopted in this work are the usual in the literature . from 2dfgrs",
    "we have selected 1567 primary galaxies with @xmath13 restricted to absolute magnitude @xmath14 .",
    "we have imposed an isolation criterion by considering primaries with no companion galaxies within projected distance @xmath15 kpc and relative radial velocity difference @xmath16 km / s , and with absolute magnitude difference @xmath17 .",
    "the value of the hubble constant in this work is assumed to be @xmath18 km / s @xmath19 .    after the selection of the primary sample , we searched for satellite galaxies around each primary .",
    "we define as satellites galaxies with @xmath7 kpc and @xmath20 km / s which are at least 2 magnitudes fainter than their primary , @xmath21 .",
    "with all these restriction our final sample consists of 3079 satellites .",
    "a few primaries have too many satellites ( up to @xmath22 objects ) .",
    "these objects are likely to be contaminated by group - like systems with the primary as the brightest group member . in order to exclude these spurious systems",
    "we have restricted the sample to 1498 primaries with @xmath23 out of the 1567 original primaries .",
    "furthermore , we notice that the removed systems show systematically high mean velocity dispersion , close to typical value of groups of galaxies , supporting our conservative cut - off in the number of members per system .",
    "we have also imposed an additional restriction to the eccentricities of the primaries in order to deal with well determined relative angles @xmath24 of satellite position with respect to the primary plane projected into the first quadrant .",
    "thus , we have not considered primaries with @xmath25",
    "the sample selected under the criteria described in the previous section allows us to investigate the satellite position angle distribution relative to the primary plane disk ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "km / s and the dotted line satellites with @xmath0 km / s .",
    "the adopted threshold @xmath26 km / s is approximately the mean value of the satellite relative velocity distribution ( 163.9 km / s).,width=317 ]    we have divided the sample into objects with high or low @xmath27 compared to @xmath28km / s ( a value close to the mean @xmath29 km / s ) .",
    "the distribution of satellite position angles for these two subsamples are shown in fig .",
    "[ vel ] . from this figure",
    "one can notice the deficiency of satellites with low @xmath24 values in the subsample of satellites with relative velocity @xmath30 km / s .",
    "on the contrary , the high velocity subsample is roughly isotropic .",
    "we may quantify the departure from isotropy defining the ratio @xmath31 of objects in planar ( @xmath3 ) to polar ( @xmath32 ) angular positions @xmath33 , for isotropy @xmath34 .",
    "the resulting values are : @xmath35 for @xmath0 km / s and @xmath36 for @xmath37 km / s . quoted uncertainties in this work",
    "were calculated based on 20 bootstrap re - samplings of the data .",
    "other useful statistical measures of this anisotropy effect can be obtained by fitting a function to the @xmath24 distribution .",
    "we have adopted a double cosine function @xmath38 , and a linear fit @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the mean number of objects and a and @xmath41 are the anisotropy parameter in each fit . for an isotropic distribution on @xmath24",
    "we expect @xmath42 .",
    "either function , the double cosine and the linear relation , are suitable to fit the data , see for instance fig . [ comp ] .",
    "we notice , however that the double cosine function is less sensitive to noise fluctuations at the extremes due to poor number statistics and therefore might provide more conservative estimate of the deviation from isotropy . for this reason we will mainly refer to the a parameter although both a and",
    "@xmath41 values are listed in the tables corresponding to the different subsamples analysed .",
    "@xmath43 & a & @xmath44 + @xmath45 & @xmath0 km / s & 0.4 & 0.1 & 1276 & 0.12 & 0.04 + @xmath46 & @xmath37 km / s & 0.0 & 0.1 & 916 & 0.01 & 0.04 +   + @xmath47 & @xmath0 km / s , + & @xmath48 kpc @xmath49 & 0.2 & 0.1 & 713 & 0.11 & 0.05 + @xmath50 & @xmath0 km / s , + & @xmath8 kpc @xmath49 & 0.2 & 0.1 & 691 & 0.12 & 0.06 +    [ tvel ]    in table [ tvel ] we list the number of satellites in each subsample ( @xmath0 km / s and @xmath37 km / s ) and the corresponding @xmath41 and a values .",
    "the a parameter for subsample @xmath45 departs from isotropy by more than @xmath51 which contrasts with the behaviour of subsample @xmath46 where @xmath52 .",
    "this reflects the trends shown in fig .",
    "[ vel ] , and is consistent with our previous estimate of @xmath31 .",
    "the fact that the anisotropy signal is not significant in the high relative velocity subsample ( @xmath37 km / s ) suggests a higher contamination due to interlopers for these objects ( see for instance zaritsky et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the number of objects per bin is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the number of physical satellites and interlopers as function of angle , respectively .",
    "false satellites should have a homogeneous distribution of @xmath24 angles , so we take @xmath56 . on the other hand ,",
    "the distribution of real satellites respect to the primary plane may present anisotropies .",
    "the observed anisotropy parameter @xmath57 is related to the real anisotropy parameter @xmath58 by : @xmath59 .",
    "thus , even a modest observed anisotropy @xmath60 , can imply a substantially large real anisotropy .    as suggested by zaritsky ( 1992 ) , the relative fraction @xmath61 of objects with @xmath62 for a given sample can provide a useful measure of the degree of contamination given the different volumes involved .",
    "if a sample is seriously contaminated by interlopers , we should obtain @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , we calculated @xmath61 for two subsamples , satellites with @xmath0 km / s and satellites with @xmath37 km / s .",
    "for these two subsamples @xmath61 values are @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively , so that from this particular test we can not argue for substantial contamination in the high velocity subsample .",
    "thus the different behaviour of high and low relative velocity satellites could be a real effect .",
    "we show two possible fit to the data . in solid curve",
    "is the linear relation and in long - dashed ones is the double cosine function .",
    ", width=317 ]    in his pioneer work , holmberg found an excess of polar satellites within 50 kpc from the primary ; nevertheless , zaritsky et al . (",
    "1996 ) could not reproduce this result , but they found such an excess at larger separations ( 250 kpc@xmath66500 kpc ) from the primaries . we have searched for possible dependences of the detected anisotropies on projected separations to the primaries .",
    "the resulting anisotropy parameter a are displayed in table [ tvel ] , where it can be appreciated the lack of strong dependence on projected separation . from now on ,",

    "the error bars correspond to poisson uncertainties .",
    "it can be appreciated in these figures that the excess of objects with @xmath32 , is distributed quite uniformly along the explored range of luminosities and spectral types .    in order to quantify the anisotropy for these subsamples we show in table [ tsat ] the corresponding values of @xmath41 and a parameters .",

    "we have carried out an analysis of the anisotropy of satellite angular positions with respect to the primary plane .",
    "the sample was selected in redshift space from the 2dfgrs and is large enough for studying possible dependencies of anisotropies on both primary and satellite properties .",
    "we confirm the existence of the effect first claimed by holmberg , that is , the preference of the satellites to lie near the pole of the primary .",
    "we note however that this effect is present up to relative projected separations @xmath7 kpc .",
    "we use an anisotropy parameter a suitable to measure the departure from isotropy in the different subsamples analysed . nevertheless , this parameter indicates a lower limit to the real anisotropy , given the contamination by false satellites expected to be uniformly distributed with respect to the primary plane .",
    "the deviation from isotropy is detected at least at @xmath51 level for objects with low values of relative velocity @xmath0 km / s while the high velocity subsample is consistent with isotropy .",
    "although in principle this effect could be related to different levels of contamination by interlopers , zaritsky 1992 test provides comparable values of contamination in both high and low relative velocity subsamples .    by inspection to the luminosity of the primaries",
    ", we conclude that the anisotropy of the distribution of satellites around faint primaries shows a high statistical significance ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "the most important signal was detected in the sample of satellites corresponding to passive star forming primaries , where the distribution of @xmath24 angles departs from isotropy at the @xmath92 level ; while the opposite behaviour is present in primaries with @xmath93 , for which the a parameter results consistent with zero .",
    "moreover , we also notice that the signal is even higher when we raise the eccentricity threshold of the primaries .",
    "we also have considered the different spectral types of the satellites , finding the strongest anisotropy for satellites with @xmath94 ( objects with little present day star formation activity ) .",
    "we notice that primaries with a low value of @xmath1 in our sample also have satellites with poor star formation activity .",
    "the isolation criteria imposed to our sample lowers the probability of including a significant number of elliptical galaxies .",
    "thus , most primaries in our sample are expected to be of late type morphology . due to the morphology density relation",
    "we expect only 10@xmath95 of our isolated sample of primaries to be ellipticals ( whitmore et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "we could in principle interpret the holmberg effect as being mainly caused by evolutionary processes .",
    "systems dominated by old stellar population objects have formed early , so the physical processes that may have removed satellites near the primary plane have been present for a large time . by contrast , in younger primary and satellite systems , we would expect a larger fraction of objects that have not been accreted yet on to the primary so that they would show an isotropic distribution of satellites .",
    "however , as discussed by quinn @xmath9 goodman ( 1986 ) , it may be difficult to produce anisotropies in the distribution of satellites from pure dynamical evolution , specially at large scale @xmath7 kpc .",
    "more likely , we suggest that according to abadi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) results , such anisotropies could be the remnants of the formation of the disks of the primaries , where substantial orbital momentum is transfered into primary rotation during the early stages of galaxy formation .",
    "thus , the anisotropy effects we detect at large projected separations , could be the relics of such mechanism .",
    "we also argue that the significant dependence of the anisotropy effect on the relative velocity between the satellite and the primary could be an important point of disagreement between the results of previous works .",
