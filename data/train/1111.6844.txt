    "approximation of set - valued functions ( svfs ) has various potential applications in optimization , control theory , mathematical economics , medical imaging and more .",
    "the problem is closely related to the approximation of an @xmath1-dimensional object from a sequence of its parallel cross - sections , since such an object can be regarded as a univariate set - valued function with sets of dimension @xmath2 as images @xcite . in particular for @xmath3 , the problem is important in medical imaging and is known as `` reconstruction from parallel cross - sections '' ( _ _ see e.g.__@xcite _ and references therein _ ) .    motivated by the problem of set - valued approximation and its applications , we develop and study set - valued subdivision schemes .",
    "real - valued subdivision schemes repeatedly refine numbers and generate limit functions .",
    "when applied componentwise to points in @xmath4 , the schemes generate smooth curves / surfaces , and as such , are widely used in computer graphics and geometric design . when the initial data are samples of a function , the limit of the subdivision approximates the sampled function .",
    "for a general review on subdivision schemes see @xcite . in this work",
    ", we propose a new method for the adaptation of subdivision schemes to sets , and show convergence and approximation properties of the resulting set - valued subdivision schemes .    in the case of data consisting of convex sets , methods based on the classical _ minkowski sum _ of sets",
    "can be used @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "sums of numbers in positive operators for real - valued approximation are replaced by minkowski sums of sets .",
    "a more recent approach is to embed the given convex sets into the banach space of _ directed sets _",
    "@xcite , and to apply any existing method for approximation in banach spaces @xcite .",
    "the case of data consisting of general sets ( not necessarily convex ) , which is relevant in many applications , is more challenging . for data sampled from a set - valued function with general sets as",
    "images , methods based on minkowski sum of sets fail to approximate the sampled function @xcite . so other operations between sets are needed .    in the spirit of frechet expectation @xcite ,",
    "z. artstein proposed in @xcite to interpolate data sampled from a set - valued function in a piecewise way , so that for two sets @xmath5 given at consecutive points @xmath6 , the interpolant @xmath7 satisfies for any @xmath8 $ ] , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a metric on sets .",
    "the relation ( [ metricproperty1 ] ) is termed the _",
    "metric property_. a weighted average of two sets introduced in @xcite , and termed later as the _ metric average _ , leads to a piecewise interpolant satisfying the metric property relative to the hausdorff metric .    extending this work , in @xcite the metric average is applied in the lane - riesenfeld algorithm for spline subdivision schemes .",
    "the set - valued subdivision schemes obtained this way are shown to approximate svfs with general sets as images . the convergence and the approximation results obtained in @xcite",
    "are based on the metric property of the metric average .",
    "the adaptation to sets of certain positive linear operators based on the metric average is described in @xcite . for reviews on set - valued approximation methods",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "as it is noticed in @xcite , the particular choice of metric is crucial to the construction and analysis of set - valued methods .",
    "while previous works develop and analyze set - valued approximation methods in the metric space of compact sets endowed with the hausdorff metric , we consider the problem in the metric space of lebesgue measurable sets with the symmetric difference metric ] .",
    "our setting allows us to approximate svfs , which are hlder continuous in the symmetric difference metric but may be discontinuous in the hausdorff metric , as illustrated by the following simple example .",
    "[ exampmotivation ] let @xmath11 be a svf from @xmath12 to subsets of @xmath12 , @xmath13 with graph given in figure [ fig : discont ] .",
    "it is easy to observe that @xmath11 is discontinues at @xmath14 ( and also at @xmath15 ) , if the distance between subsets of @xmath12 is measured in the hausdorff metric , but it is lipschitz continuous everywhere if the distance is measured in the symmetric difference metric .    , which is lipschitz continuous relative to the symmetric difference metric , while discontinuous relative to the hausdorff metric .",
    "]    on the other hand , under mild assumptions on the sets @xmath16 , hlder continuity in the hausdorff metric implies hlder continuity in the symmetric difference metric @xcite .",
    "since there is an intrinsic connection between the continuity and approximability of a function , approximation results for hlder continuous svfs obtained in the symmetric difference metric apply to a wider class of functions than similar results obtained in the hausdorff metric .    in order to develop approximation methods in the space of sets with the symmetric difference metric",
    ", we introduce a new binary weighted average of _ regular compact jordan measurable _ sets .",
    "the new average is built upon the method introduced in @xcite , which is known as the _ shaped - based interpolation _ in the engineering literature @xcite .",
    "our new average has the metric property relative to the symmetric difference metric .",
    "in addition when both weights are non - negative , the measure of the average of the two sets is equal to the average with the same weights of the measures of the two sets .",
    "we term this feature of the new average the _ measure property _ , and term our average the _ measure average_.    the measure average performs locally on each _ connected component _ of the symmetric difference of the two operand sets , leading to satisfactory geometric performance , which is essential in many applications . in particular , the ideas of this work lead to a practical algorithm for the reconstruction of 3d objects from their 2d cross - sections described in @xcite .",
    "first we use the measure average to interpolate between a sequence of sets in a piecewise way .",
    "then we adapt to sets spline subdivision schemes , expressed in terms of repeated binary averages of numbers using the lane - riesenfeld algorithm @xcite . as in the case of the metric average @xcite , we prove convergence of the spline subdivision to a lipschitz continuous limit svf @xmath17 .",
    "it follows from the measure property of the measure average , that @xmath18 is the limit of the same spline subdivision scheme applied to the measures of the initial sets .",
    "moreover , we prove that spline subdivision schemes adapted to sets with the measure average are monotonicity preserving in the sense of the set - inclusion relation .",
    "it is well known , that in order to obtain `` reasonable '' interpolation methods other than the piecewise interpolation , some notion of extrapolation is needed .",
    "our measure average of sets is defined for positive weights and also when one weight is negative , therefore it performs both interpolation and extrapolation . using the measure average with both negative and non - negative weights , we adapt to sets the 4-point interpolatory subdivision scheme of @xcite .",
    "this is the first adaptation of an interpolatory subdivision scheme to sets .",
    "we prove that the 4-point subdivision scheme based on the measure average converges to a continuous limit svf and approximates hlder continuous svfs , when the initial sets are samples of such a function .",
    "we observe that many results on set - valued subdivision obtained in this and previous works are based on the triangle inequality in the underlying metric space , along with the metric property of the average of sets .",
    "employing this observation , we extend several results obtained in the context of metric spaces of sets , to general metric spaces endowed with an average having the metric property .",
    "the structure of this work is as follows .",
    "preliminary definitions are given in section [ sectionpreliminaries ] .",
    "in section [ sectiondistanceaverage ] , we study properties of the average of sets based on the method in @xcite , which are relevant to the construction of our measure average . in section [ sectionmeasureaverage ]",
    "we introduce our measure average of sets , prove its important features and apply it to the interpolation between sets in a piecewise way .",
    "spline subdivision schemes based on the measure average are studied in section [ sectionsplinesubdivision ] , while in section [ section4pointscheme ] , we adapt to sets the 4-point subdivision scheme . in section [ sectioncomputation ] ,",
    "we provide several computational examples illustrating our analytical results .",
    "finally , extensions of some of the results obtained in metric spaces of sets to general metric spaces are discussed in section [ sectionextensions ] .",
    "first we introduce some definitions and notation .",
    "we denote by @xmath19 the n - dimensional _ lebesgue measure _ and by @xmath20 the collection of _ lebesgue measurable subsets _ of @xmath0 having finite measure . the _ set difference _ of two sets",

    "we recall that a set @xmath31 is _ jordan measurable _ if and only if @xmath37 .",
    "it is easy to see that for a jordan measurable @xmath31 , @xmath38    we denote by @xmath39 the subset of @xmath20 consisting of _ regular compact jordan measurable sets_. notice that for any @xmath40 , @xmath41 implies @xmath42 , therefore @xmath43 is a metric of @xmath39 .",

    "the basic tool for the construction of the measure average of sets to be introduced in the next section is what we call the _ distance average _ of sets . in this section",
    "we derive properties of the distance average that are relevant to our construction .",
