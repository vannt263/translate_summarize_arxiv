    "the reasons for this interest are both theoretical and phenomenological . in the latter case",
    ", early analyses of the pion - nucleon sigma term @xcite and later results for the nucleon s inclusive , spin - dependent deep - inelastic structure functions @xcite suggested that a non - trivial fraction of the nucleon s mass and spin are carried by the @xmath4 component of the sea .",
    "subsequent analyses of the sigma - term have reduced the value of @xmath5 , and therefore the strange - quark contribution to @xmath6 , by a factor of two @xcite , while studies of su(3)-breaking in the axial vector octet imply a theoretical uncertainty in the value of @xmath7 , the strange quark contribution to the nucleon s spin extracted from deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) measurements , sufficiently large to make the bounds on @xmath7 consistent with zero @xcite . nevertheless , the early analyses of the sigma term and polarized dis results have motivated proposals to measure another strange - quark observable , @xmath8 . indeed , several low- and medium - energy parity - violating electron scattering experiments are either underway or planned at mit - bates @xcite , cebaf @xcite and mainz @xcite with the goal of measuring the two form factors which parameterize the nucleon s strange quark vector current , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    theoretically , strange - quarks are interesting because they do nt appear explicitly in most quark model descriptions of the nucleon .",
    "although the quark model provides a useful intuitive picture of the nucleon s substructure and has seen considerable success in accounting for a wide range of properties of the low - lying hadrons @xcite , one knows that there is more to the nucleon than the three constituent quarks .",
    "in particular , processes such as dis and drell - yan have provided considerable insight regarding the important role played by the @xmath11 and gluon sea when the nucleon interacts at high energies @xcite .",
    "almost no information exists , however , regarding the low - energy manifestations of the sea . because strange quarks constitute purely sea degrees of freedom , low- and intermediate - energy determinations of strange quark matrix elements offer a new window on the low - energy \" structure of the nucleon which goes beyond the description provided by the quark model .",
    "in particular , the weak neutral current scattering experiments mentioned above should set bounds on the spatial polarization of the @xmath12 sea @xcite , its contributions to the nucleon magnetic moment @xcite and spin @xcite , and its role in the nuclear response at moderate momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "one has seen considerable progress over the past few years in clarifying the interpretation of neutral current observables in terms of strangeness matrix elements @xcite .",
    "the situation regarding theoretical predictions for these matrix elements is less advanced .",
    "ideally , one would hope to draw inferences from the deep inelastic data on @xmath13- and @xmath14-distributions @xcite for elastic vector and axial vector strangeness matrix elements .",
    "however , the high - energy data provide light - cone momentum distribution functions , and one does not know at present how to translate this information into the spin and spatial nucleon wavefunctions as needed to compute charge radii , magnetic moments , _ etc . _",
    "similarly , one might hope for first - principles microscopic predictions using lattice qcd .",
    "to date , lattice results for the strangeness axial charge @xcite and strangeness magnetic moment @xcite have been obtained in the quenched approximation , and one anticipates a refinement of these results as lattice methods continue to advance . in the absence of definitive lattice calculations  and with an eye toward understanding the mechanisms which govern the scale of nucleon strangeness ",
    "a variety of model calculations have been performed .",
    "the latter have yielded a wide array of predictions for strangeness matrix elements which vary in both magnitude and sign @xcite . while one might argue _ ad nauseum _ about the relative merits of different models , there is no compelling reason to take any particular model calculation as definitive .    in an effort to add some clarity to this situation",
    ", we discuss in this paper the implications for nucleon strangeness vector current matrix elements of one of the underlying , approximate symmetries of qcd : chiral symmetry .",
    "the use of chiral symmetry , in the guise of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , has proven highly effective in predicting and interpreting a wide variety of low - energy observables @xcite",
    ". the essential strategy of chpt is to exploit the approximate @xmath15 chiral symmetry of qcd for the three lightest flavors to relate one set of observables to another ( accounting for loop effects ) , or to draw on one set of measured quantities to predict another .",
    "this approach has recently been employed to analyze of baryon octet and decuplet magnetic moments @xcite and the nucleon s isovector charge radius @xcite .",
    "as we illustrate below , this strategy breaks down in the flavor - singlet channel , rendering chpt un - predictive for the nucleon s strangeness matrix elements .",
    "the reason is that the coefficients of the relevant flavor - singlet operators in the chiral lagrangian , which contain information on short - distance hadronic effects , can not be determined from existing measurements by using chiral symmetry .",
    "although the leading , non - analytic long - distance ( loop ) contributions are calcuable ( @xmath16 for the strangeness magnetic moment and @xmath17 for the strangeness radius ) , one has no reason to assume that they are numerically more important than the unknown analytic terms arising at the same or lower order from the chiral lagrangian .",
    "the only rigorous way to determine these unknown analytic contributions is to measure the very quantity one would like to predict : the nucleon s flavor - singlet current matrix element .",
    "consequently , if one wishes to make any predictions at all , one must invoke additional  and therefore model - dependent  assumptions .",
    "we illustrate this next line of defense in three forms : ( a ) a resonance saturation `` model in which the unknown constants arising in chiral perturbation theory are determined by the @xmath0-channel exchange of vector mesons ; ( b ) a class of models in which the nucleon s kaon cloud '' is assumed to dominate the strangeness form factors ; and ( c ) constituent chiral quark models in which nucleon s strangeness matrix elements arise from the strangeness content of the constituent @xmath18- and @xmath19-quarks .",
    "for each of these approaches , we present new calculations and compare them with calculations discussed elsewhere in the literature .",
    "the corresponding results are unabashedly model - dependent and , therefore , not strong .",
    "we give them mainly to illustrate the outer limits to which one might go in employing chiral symmetry to compute @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "although there exist additional chiral model approaches not considered in detail here , we believe that the three which we discuss are sufficiently representative so as to illustrate the breadth of predictions permitted by chiral symmetry . among these predictions , there does appear to be one having a greater degree of credibility than others : the value of the dirac mean square strangeness radius arising from the vector meson exchange , or resonance saturation , model . nevertheless , even in this case , the logic is not airtight .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the strangeness and isoscalar electromagnetic form factors within the framework of dispersion relations could reveal important contributions not included in the resonance saturation approach .",
    "we organize our discussion of these points as follows .",
    "in section ii we review the effective low - energy chiral lagrangians which describe the interaction of pseudoscalar mesons with baryons or quarks . in section iii",

    ", we consider the em dirac charge radii . in the case of the isovector radius ,",
    "the loop contribution is signficantly larger than the experimental value : @xmath212 ( taking @xmath149 ) .",

    "our result also includes the @xmath214-loop contribution . although the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite was carried out without using the heavy baryon formalism , the result agrees with the chiral log of the heavy baryon calculation .",
    "the results for the magnetic moment differ , however .",
    "] one therefore requires a contribution from @xmath215 which cancels about 40% of the loop contribution . the @xmath216 meson contribution to @xmath215 , computed using the values of @xmath176 taken from @xmath217 data and @xmath174 determined from fits to @xmath218 scattering amplitudes @xcitehas the wrong sign to bring about this cancellation .",
    "in fact , a careful analysis of the isovector spectral function for the dirac form factor , which contains information about both the continuum and @xmath216 resonance contributions , can be used to extract a value for @xmath174 consistent with the value used in @xmath218 scattering studies @xcite .",
    "such an analysis includes pion rescattering corrections which reduce the two pion continuum contribution and allow for a larger @xmath216 pole term . in the case of the isoscalar dirac radius , on the other hand",
    ", the kaon loop contribution to the isoscalar dirac radius is about 15% of the experimental value . to the extent that the multi - pion continuum and kaon rescattering contributions are neglegible , @xmath219 is therefore resonance dominated .",
    "third , one must note the presence of an issue of consistency between the resonance saturation model employed here and the ways in which the constants @xmath142 and @xmath128 have been extracted . in the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite , no continuum contributions were included in the fit to the isoscalar form factors .",
    "such an approximation may be valid in the case of the isoscalar dirac radius , for which the loop contributions represent a reasonably small fraction of the total .",

    "chiral perturbation theory therefore requires a large constant @xmath224 to cancel most of this loop contribution .",
    "unfortunately , the most reliable information one has on the resonance contributions to the isoscalar magnetic form factor is derived from the fits of ref .",
    "@xcite , which included no continuum .",
    "the residues @xmath225 obtained from these fits are small ( on the order of @xmath226 ) and , therefore , can not cancel the large kaon loop contribution .",
    "presumably , a reanalysis of the isoscalar magnetic form factor which included the kaon continuum at one - loop order would yield larger values for the residues .",
    "we would conclude from these observations that , of the resonance saturation predictions quoted in table i , the value for the dirac radius is the more credible .    * kaon cloud dominance . *",
    "a second possibility is to relax the requirement that one undertake a consistent chiral expansion and use kaon loops alone to make a prediction .",
    "the rationale for this approach has a two - fold basis .",
    "the first follows from a geometric interpretation of the nucleon charge radius , wherein it characterizes a spatial asymmetry in the charge distribution . in this picture ,",
    "a spatial polarization of the strange sea arises from fluctuations of the nucleon into a kaon and strange baryon .",
    "the kaon , having about half the mass of the lightest strange baryons lives on average further from the nucleon center of mass than the strange baryon .",
    "one would expect , then , to obtain a negative value for @xmath227 ( positive value for @xmath92 ) , since the kaon carries the @xmath228 .",
    "implicit in this picture is an assumption that @xmath4 pair creation by the neutral gauge boson probe , which also contributes to the dirac or electric form factors and which appears partially in the guise of resonance contributions , is negligible compared to the mechanism of @xmath4 spatial polarization .",
    "the kaon cloud dominance approach also assumes that the multi - pion contribution is negligible when compared to that of the kaon cloud , ostensibly because the pion contains no valence @xmath13 or @xmath228 quarks .",
    "the second motivation draws on the result of a pion loop calculation of the nucleon s em form factors first carried out by bethe and dehoffman @xcite .",
    "this calculation was performed using the equivalent of the linear @xmath229-model . at the time they were reported ,",
    "the results were in surprising agreement with the experimental values for the nucleon s charge radii and magnetic moments , despite the large value of the @xmath230 coupling which enters this perturbative calculation .",
    "the lore which developed in the aftermath of this calculation is that the pion cloud dominates the nucleon s isovector em moments and that a one - loop calculation sufficiently incorporates the physics of the pion cloud .",
    "were this situation to persist in the strangeness sector , one would expect that the kaon cloud gives the dominant contribution to the @xmath92 and @xmath93 and that a one loop calculation would suffice to give their correct magnitude and sign .",
    "a variety of one - loop calculations have been performed assuming that the kaon cloud dominates the strange form factors .",
    "for example , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite computed @xmath231 and @xmath232 within the context of the su(3 ) linear @xmath229-model . within this framework , the leading strangeness moments are u.v .",
    "nevertheless , the calculation was performed by including hadronic form factors at the @xmath233 vertices , drawing on results of fits to baryon - baryon scattering in the one meson exchange approximation which find better agreement with data if hadronic form factors are included .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite extended this approach to compute both the leading moments as well as the non - leading @xmath84-dependence of the strangeness form factors using a hybrid kaon - loop / vector - meson pole model .",
    "although the hybrid model goes beyond a simple one - loop approximation , it nevertheless represents a type of kaon cloud model inasmuch as non - resonant multi - pion contributions are omitted .",
    "another variation of this general approach is a study performed using the cloudy bag model ( cbm ) and the cloudy \" constituent quark model ( ccqm)@xcite . the cbm represents a kind of marriage of the mit bag model with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry .",
    "the strength of the meson - baryon vertices is determined by the meson - quark coupling and the quark s bag model wavefunction .",
    "the ccqm is similar in spirit , though in this case the non - relativistic constituent quarks are confined with a harmonic oscillator potential . in effect , the cbm and ccqm calculations represent kaon loop calculations in which the @xmath234 and @xmath235 form factors are determined by the dynamics of the particular models .",
    "more recently , geiger and isgur have extended the kaon cloud idea to include one loop contributions from all known strange mesons and baryons using the non - relativistic quark model to obtain a nucleon / strange hadron vertex function @xcite .    in all cases ,",
    "these models include contributions which are both non - analytic and analytic in the @xmath13-quark mass , effectively modelling contributions from the relevant higher - dimension operators appearing in an effective lagrangian .",
    "moreover , in each instance the loop integration was cut - off at some momentum scale by including form factors at the hadronic vertices . in both respects ,",
    "a consistent chiral expansion is lost . in principle , higher - order loop contributions could yield terms of the same chiral order as some of the analytic terms retained from the one - loop amplitudes .",
    "similarly , the use of hadronic form factors with a cut - off parameter breaks the consistency of the expansion because a new scale is introduced ( _ e.g. _ , the @xmath236 ) and/or because the form factor itself contributes like an infinite tower of higher - dimension operators .",
    "one might argue that since @xmath237 is not small , the chiral expansion is not all that useful in the case of strange quarks and that models which are inconsistent with this expansion may yet be credible @xcite .",
    "we wish to illustrate , nonetheless , that the approach of kaon cloud dominance still presents a host of uncertainties . to do so , we repeat the calculation of ref .",

    "indeed , the strangeness radius and magnetic moment can vary by an order of magnitude and by sign .",
    "one ought to conclude that chiral symmetry by itself is not a terribly restrictive input principle when it comes to predicting nucleon strangeness .",
    "the reason is essentially that the quantity one wishes to predict is the very quantity one needs in order to make a prediction  the su(3)-singlet vector current moments .",
    "in the absence of experimental information on the latter , the range in one s predictions can be as wide as the breadth of one s space of chiral models . from the standpoint of hadron structure theory ,",
    "this situation is not very satisfying , since one would like to possess a reliable effective - theory framework for interpreting the up - coming measurements of the low - energy properities of the @xmath4 sea .",
    "nevertheless , one may still ask whether there exist reasons to give greater credibility to one approach over the others . in this respect , we admit to some bias in favor of the resonance saturation prediction for the dirac strangeness radius  if only because it appears to suffer from fewer ambiguities than the other approaches .",
    "the reasons for this bias can be summarized as follows :    \\(a ) detailed analyses of the isovector charge radius imply that it is dominated by the lowest continuum state ( two pions ) and the lightest isovector @xmath207 resonance .",
    "although a simple one pion loop plus @xmath216 resonance calculation over - predicts the isovector charge radius by a factor of two @xcite , the sign and order of magnitude are given correctly .",
    "the over - prediction appears to result from the omission of non - resonant pion rescattering corrections @xcite .",
    "\\(b ) one would expect a similar situation to persist in the isoscalar and strangeness channels , where the lightest continuum states are the @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath280 , and @xmath220 states and the lightest isoscalar @xmath207 vector mesons are the @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "some thought about chiral counting suggests that the multi - pion contributions ought to be suppressed relative to the @xmath220 contribution . to the extent that this suppression holds and that the total , non - resonant @xmath220 contribution to the isoscalar charge radius is at least as small as given the result of the one - loop heavy baryon calculation , the isoscalar charge radius would then be dominated by the lightest isoscalar vector mesons , rendering the fit of ref .",
    "@xcite quite valid .",
    "the results of this fit indicate that the @xmath191 and @xmath192 residues dominate the isoscalar dirac radius ; the contribution from higher mass vector mesons is negligible . thus , the isoscalar constants @xmath224 and @xmath222 should be given quite reliably by the @xmath191 and @xmath192 contributions .",
    "\\(c ) knowledge of the @xmath191 and @xmath192 flavor content allows one to translate the @xmath191 and @xmath192 contributions to the isoscalar constants into the corresponding contributions to the strangeness constants , @xmath142 and @xmath128 . if the non - resonant multi - pion contributions to the strangeness radius are suppressed with respect to the @xmath220 contribution , if the kaon loop contribution ( eq .",

    "one should note that this line of argument avoids the problematic use of assumptions about the strangeness form factors large @xmath84 behavior while incorporating the consistency of the heavy baryon chiral expansion .",

    ".    1._kaon cloud dominance .",
    "_ kaon cloud dominance models can be challenged on at least three grounds : ( a ) they sacrifice consistent chiral counting in order to make predictions .",
    "this sacrifice comes about through the introduction of form factors at the hadronic vertices and through the retention of terms in the one - loop amplitudes which are both analytic and non - analytic in the strange quark mass .",
    "terms of the former class are indistinguishable from contributions arising from higher - dimension operators in the chiral lagrangian . moreover",
    ", higher - order loop graphs may yield analytic terms of the same chiral order as some of the analytic terms retained from the one - loop graphs .",
    "a consistent chiral approach would require the inclusion of all analytic contributions of a given order in @xmath94 .",

    "it is instructive to try and quantify the uncertainty associated with these ambiguities .",
    "this effort is most easily accomplished for those of type ( c ) by considering the @xmath241-dependence of the linear and non - linear @xmath229-model predictions and by comparing these predictions with those of the cbm and ccqm calculations . turning first to the issue of the cut - off dependence",
    ", one may argue about which value of @xmath241 to use .",
    "the results quoted in table i and ref .",
    "@xcite for the linear @xmath229-model were obtained using the bonn value , @xmath283 gev . according to the fits of ref .",
    "@xcite , taking @xmath284 optimizes agreement with baryon - baryon scattering data in the one meson - exchange approximation . for this choice of @xmath241 , however , the corresponding pion loop contributions to the em moments are in serious disagreement with the experimental values .",
    "in fact , there exists no value of @xmath241 which produces agreement between experiment and the linear @xmath229-model values for the em moments .",
    "the best choice occurs for @xmath285 gev . in this case ,",
    "experiment and the linear @xmath229-model agree for @xmath286 while the prediction for @xmath287 is 60% of the experimental value .",
    "changing @xmath241 from @xmath288 to @xmath285 gev doubles the prediction for @xmath93 and reduces the prediction for @xmath281 by 25% .",
    "the choice of @xmath241 in the case of the non - linear @xmath229-model is equally debatable , as a study of the pion - loop contribution to the isovector magnetic moment illustrates .",
    "we find no value of the cut - off which reproduces the experimental value .",
    "choosing @xmath289 yields , for example , @xmath290 ( the corresponding ratio for the isovector dirac radius is@xmath291 ) . taking the limit @xmath292",
    "gives @xmath293 ( the isovector dirac radius diverges in this limit ) .",
    "one might argue , then , that choosing any value of the cut - off in the range @xmath294 would be equally justified  at least for the magnetic moments which are u.v .",
    "finite . as the cutoff",
    "is varied over this range , @xmath93 varies from the value quoted in table i to @xmath295 .",
    "this situation appears to persist in the case of the cbm and ccqm models as well .",
    "the authors of ref . @xcite originally found values for the cut - off which optimized agreement with all the nucleon s em moments . however , a subsequent inclusion of covariantizing seagull graphs changed the magnetic moment predictions by 50% so that an optimum cutoff no longer exists .",
    "consequently , the corresponding predictions for the strangeness moments contains an uncertainty associated with the value of the cut - off .",
    "a comparison between different kaon cloud models reveals a similar degree of ambiguity . we consider first the linear and non - linear @xmath229-models .",
    "when one of the baryons is off shell , as is the case in a loop calculation , the structure of the meson - baryon vertices differ in the two models , even though the same monopole form factor was used in both calculations .",
    "when one takes @xmath296 , the two models give nearly identical predictions for @xmath281 .",
    "one might not be surprised by this result , since in both cases the radius contains a chiral log .",
    "at least in the chiral limit , this infrared singularity dominates over contributions analytic in @xmath297 , and it is essentially terms of the latter type which would be responsible for any differences in the two predictions . for @xmath292 , on the other hand , @xmath281 diverges in the non - linear @xmath229-model but only doubles in value in the linear @xmath229-model . in the case of the strangeness magnetic moments , which contain no infrared or ultraviolate singularities ,",
    "the model predictions differ by a factor of about 1.5 for @xmath259 in the case of the linear @xmath229-model corresponds to @xmath277 gev . ] but come into closer agreement for @xmath292 .",
    "comparing the cbm and @xmath229-model ( @xmath298 ) predictions , one finds cbm gives a 50% larger dirac radius but a value for @xmath93 that is a factor of three or four smaller than the linear @xmath229-model prediction .",
    "these comparisons are not definitive . nevertheless , they suggest a scale for uncertainty in the kaon cloud dominance predictions that amounts to about a factor of five or more times the smallest values for @xmath299 and @xmath300 .",
    "this rather large model - spread reflects two of the weaknesses of the kaon cloud dominance approach : ( a ) the lack of a systematic expansion procedure ( _ e.g. _ , perturbative coupling , chiral , @xmath301 _ etc . _ ) with which to control the one - loop approximation , and ( b ) the omission of potentially important short - distance contributions ( _ e.g. _ , the chiral counterterms @xmath302 , @xmath0-channel resonances , _ etc . _ ) .",

    "_ models wherein the nucleon strangeness moments arise from the strangeness content \" of consitutent quarks can be challenged on three fronts : ( a ) the credibility of the model itself for the problem at hand ; ( b ) the procedure for computing the constituent quark strangeness vector current ; and ( c ) the proper treatment of collective or many - quark contributions .",
    "the chiral quark model calculation illustrates all three issues .",
    "as discussed earlier , the problem of double counting the lightest pseudscalar states raises questions about the nave chiral quark model . although this difficutly can be addressed using more sophisticated treatments @xcite , the second issue is more problematic . as in the case of baryon effective theories ,",
    "the calculation of the constituent quark strangeness matrix elements employs loops .",
    "a consistent chiral quark calculation implies the presence of terms in the chiral quark lagrangian which carry unknown coefficients .",
    "these coefficients can not be determined without knowing the strangeness matrix elements themselves .",
    "this dilemma is the same one which hampers heavy baryon chpt as a predictive tool . as a fall",
    "back , one can employ form factors to cut off the loop integrals at a scale @xmath61 as we did in arriving at the numbers in table i , but price one pays is the presence of all the ambiguities encountered when using hadronic form factors in hadronic loops . presumably , the spread in predictions for the constituent quark strangeness currents is as broad as are the kaon cloud dominance predictions for the nucleon s strangeness moments .",
    "when one considers models other than the chiral quark model , the situation is even less controlled .",
    "for example , the njl model , which provides an alternative model for the constituent quark strangeness radius , gives a value for @xmath85 that has the opposite sign from the chiral quark prediction and about 40% of the magnitude .",
    "finally , when one compares the predictions for chiral quark model and non - linear @xmath229-model predictions for @xmath281 , one finds that the former is a factor of five larger than the latter . in both cases ,",
    "the form for the meson - fermion vertex is the same , including the approximate value of the form factor cut - off .",
    "one faces the question as to whether these two calculations give independent contributions which should be added , or whether there is some overlap between the two .",
    "one might argue in favor of the second possibility by noting that at the quark level , a loop involving a kaon and strange baryon intermediate state contains diagrams in which a constituent quark fluctuates into a freely propagating @xmath250-quark and kaon plus others in which the @xmath250-quark interacts with the other intermediate - state constituent quarks . in this line of reasoning",
    ", the chiral quark model calculation would give an over - prediction for @xmath281 due to the omission of quark - quark interactions ( many - quark effects ) .",
    "* experimental implications*. with these caveats in mind , it is interesting to ask what the up - coming neutral current experiments will be able to say about any of the model predictions in table i. to that end , some observations about their magnitude and sign is in order . in the case of @xmath93 ,",
    "all of the models , except for the resonance saturation model , give @xmath303 . the large positive value for @xmath93 in the resonance saturation model results from a large loop contribution  enhanced by a factor of @xmath304  and the questionable absence of correspondingly large vector meson terms . as for the strangeness radius ,",
    "all of the calculations containing kaon loops ( except resonance saturation ) give the same sign for @xmath92 and magnitudes which vary by a factor of five .",
    "the sign corresponds to the nave expectation derived from the kaon cloud picture in which the kaon , containing the @xmath228-quark , lives farther , on average , from the nucleon s center of mass than does the @xmath241 , where the @xmath13-quark resides .",
    "the pole and resonance saturation models , however , give strangeness radii having much larger magnitudes and the opposite sign .",
    "the latter results follow from the fits of refs . @xcite which yield a large @xmath305 coupling .",
    "note that in the case of the resonance saturation model , the large @xmath192-pole contribution to @xmath281 is cancelled to some extent by the continuum term ( loops ) , whereas in the pure pole model , the @xmath192 contribution is cancelled to an even greater degree by the questionable @xmath193 residue .",
    "an experimental result consistent with resonance saturation value @xmath281 would suggest that resonant @xmath0-channel kaon and multi - pion rescattering ( poles ) are the most important physics behind the strangeneness radius . a significantly smaller result , or one having the opposite sign , would imply the presence of large continuum contributions going beyond one - loop order or important higher - mass resonance terms",
    ".    how might the various parity - violating electron scattering experiments do in terms of sorting out among these scenarios ?",
    "the sample experiment at mit - bates @xcite and @xmath306 \" experiment planned for cebaf @xcite anticipate a determination of @xmath93 with an error bar of @xmath307 . at this level of precision",
    ", these experiments could confirm the presence of a large strangeness magnetic moment ( on the order of the resonance saturation prediction ) or rule out the remaining predictions .",
    "it would be difficult for the sample and @xmath306 measurements to confirm any of these remaining predictions without significantly better precision .",
    "as far as the strangeness radius is concerned , one anticipates a determination of @xmath85 with an error of @xmath308 from the hall a and c experiments at cebaf @xcite .",
    "these experiments could see a strangeness radius at the level of the pole and resonance saturation predictions and , at best could rule out ( but not confirm ) the remaining entries in table i.    parenthetically , one might note that forward angle parity - violating electron scattering experiments with a proton target @xcite are sensitive to the linear combination @xmath309 where @xmath310 is the proton s magentic moment @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that a determination of this linear combination is useful as a first pass \" probe of the nucleon s strangeness vector current .",
    "navely , a one might conclude that a small result for this quantity would indicate small magnitudes for @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in the case of the resonance saturation model , for example ,",
    "prediction for @xmath311 is an order of magnitude smaller than the predicted values of either @xmath85 or @xmath93 alone , owing to a cancellation between the two terms .",

    "one ought to be cautious , therefore , about drawing strong conclusions from a forward angle measurement alone .",
    "a pair of forward and backward angle measurements , allowing for separate determinations of @xmath93 and @xmath92 , would be more relevant to the comparison of model predictions .",
    "in this study , we sought to delineate the extent to which chiral symmetry can be used to arrive at predictions for the nucleon s strangeness vector current form factors . since chpt has proven quite useful in other contexts , it is timely to analyze its usefulness in the case of nucleon strangeness .",
    "moreover , since the role of the @xmath4 sea in the nucleon s low - energy properties is of considerable interest to the hadron structure community , and since significant experimental effort is being devoted to measuring the nucleon s strange quark form factors , one would like to possess an effective theory framework in which to understand the strong interaction dynamics behind the numbers to be extracted .",
    "ideally , chpt would have provided such a framework .",
    "we hope to have convinced the reader that nucleon strangeness ( or , equivalently , the su(3)-singlet channel ) presents barriers to the applicability of chiral symmetry not present in other cases where symmetry has proven more useful .",
    "to reiterate : the reason for this difficulty is that the quantity one wishes to predict  the strangeness ( or su(3)-singlet ) vector current matrix element  is the same quantity one needs to know in order to make a prediction .",
    "consequently , we turned our attention to chiral models .",
    "we explored three such model approaches as a representative sampling : a resonance saturation model for the unknown low - energy constants arising in chpt ; kaon cloud dominance models ; and models in which chiral symmetry is used to obtain the strangeness currents of constituent @xmath18- and @xmath19-quarks .",
    "these different approaches yield a rather broad range of predictions for the nucleon s strangeness radius and magnetic moment .",
    "this situation is not surprising , since none of the approaches relies solely on the underlying symmetries of low - energy qcd .",
    "we have tried to argue that there may exist one case in which a chiral model gives a credible prediction : the resonance saturation value for the dirac strangeness radius .",
    "of the models considered here , resonance saturation stays closest to the framework of chpt while relying on well - defined phenomenological input .",
    "moreover , it is clear which physics has not been included ( higher - mass poles as well as non - resonant kaon rescattering and multi - pion continuum contributions ) . should the experimental result for @xmath281 differ significantly from the resonance saturation value , one has a reasonable idea of what physics is likely to be responsible for the discrepancy . in all other cases , including the resonance saturation prediction for @xmath93 , we have pointed out what appear to be good reasons to question the believability of chiral model calculations .",
    "nucleon strangeness remains a highly interesting subject on which experiment will shed some light .",
    "assuming that the strangeness radius and magnetic moment are separately determined with the precision anticipated for the parity - violation experiments @xcite , one could , for example , test the resonance saturation prediction for @xmath281 .",
    "given the ambiguities present in the other approaches , an exprimental result for @xmath281 consistent with the corresponding predictions would not be conclusive .",
    "a similar statement applies to all of the model predictions for @xmath93 . in short ,",
    "need for a better theoretical understanding of the nucleon s strangeness form factors remains an open problem . in this respect , a more detailed analysis within the context of dispersion relations appears to be a promising direction . in particular",
