    "deep x - ray surveys have revealed many bright x - ray point sources with weak or no emission lines in their optical spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". called x - ray bright optically normal galaxies ( xbongs ) or `` optically dull '' agns ( the name adopted here ) , these objects require an agn to produce their high x - ray luminosities but lack the broad or narrow emission line signatures of agn accretion .",
    "optically dull agns make up @xmath615% of luminous ( @xmath7  erg / s ) point sources in deep x - ray surveys , and @xmath625% of those at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "three major paradigms exist to explain their x - ray brightness and optical dullness : ( 1 ) obscuration of both narrow and broad emission lines , ( 2 ) dilution by host galaxy starlight , and ( 3 ) a physically distinct accretion flow .",
    "we explore the evidence for and against each paradigm in turn .",
    "the standard agn unified model has had great success in using obscuration to explain the differences between optically selected type 1 ( broad - line ) and type 2 ( narrow - line ) agns @xcite . in the simplest interpretation of this model ,",
    "all agns have the broad optical emission lines and strong uv / optical continua of type 1 agns , but along certain lines of sight these features are obscured within a dusty `` torus '' a few parsecs from the black hole . in an obscured object the narrow emission lines remain visible because they are excited beyond the obscuring material , and so the lack of a blr and weaker optical continuum of type 2 agns are attributed to obscuration .",
    "similarly , @xcite and @xcite suggested that optically dull agns have the same physical engine as a type 1 or type 2 agn , but with additional obscuration within a few parsecs completely blocking the ionizing continuum radiation from exciting even the narrow emission lines .",
    "@xcite instead suggest that optically dull agns are obscured by extranuclear ( @xmath9100 pc ) gas and dust in the host galaxy , blocking the narrow lines along the observer s line of sight .",
    "no matter the physical location of the obscuring material , it must preferentially absorb the optical emission , since optically dull agns remain x - ray bright .",
    "indeed , more than half of optically dull agns are relatively unobscured ( @xmath10 @xmath11 ) in the x - rays @xcite . preferentially obscuring the optical emission while remaining x - ray unabsorbed would require extreme gas - to - dust ratios not observed in other agns @xcite .",
    "optically dull agns could also be type 2 agns with narrow emission lines diluted by a bright host galaxy .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed that many @xmath12 agns would appear optically dull if observed at @xmath13 , since the host galaxy would occupy more of the spectroscopic slit or fiber and consequently overwhelm the agn emission lines .",
    "hst / acs images additionally show that many optically dull agn hosts at @xmath8 are edge - on @xcite or have a second galaxy falling within the spectroscopic aperture @xcite .",
    "however 10 - 20% of local ( undiluted ) agns are optically dull @xcite . and",
    "even after removing the host galaxy light by decomposing the spectral energy distribution , @xmath61/3 of optically dull agns have anomalously high x - ray to optical flux ratios @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that optically dull agns have different accretion physics due to low accretion rates @xcite .",
    "models have long predicted that an agn with a low accretion rate ( @xmath14 ) will have a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) within some truncation radius @xmath15 , with @xmath15 defined as where the collisional cooling time is comparable to the accretion time @xcite . beyond @xmath15",
    ", accretion will remain in a standard geometrically thin and optically thick disk with a thermal blackbody spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however within @xmath15 there are too few collisions to couple the ions and electrons and the gas becomes a two - temperature plasma .",
    "the electrons are cooled by bremsstrahlung , synchrotron , and compton up - scattering , while the ions remain at the virial temperature .",
    "this means the flow is geometrically thick and optically thin .",
    "a riaf then lacks much of the optical / uv blackbody emission of an optically thick accretion disk , and consequently can not ionize and/or excite the broad or narrow optical emission lines seen in other agns @xcite .",
    "because the ions in the riaf are only marginally bound , such agns should also have strong outflows and be consequently radio luminous .",
    "optically dull agns , especially those with high x - ray to optical flux ratios , are indeed observed to be have higher ratios of radio to optical / uv luminosity than type 1 agns @xcite .",
    "much of the optical and infrared light in riaf agns may be synchrotron radiation associated with the radio jet @xcite .",
    "each of these three paradigms has a different signature in spectropolarimetry .",
    "anisotropic obscuration of the narrow emission lines would leave telltale reflected emission lines in the polarized spectrum @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if an optically dull agn is a type 2 agn diluted by a host galaxy , its polarized flux would be equally diluted .",
    "( a diluted optically dull agn might exhibit polarized broad emission lines like those seen in type 2 agns , but the host galaxy would probably overwhelm them to a non - detectable level . ) and if optically dull agns have riafs we might observe a featureless polarized continuum , either from the synchrotron emission associated with the stronger radio jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or because we are viewing the naked , lineless continuum ( from the disk beyond the riaf ) reflected by a scattering surface in the host galaxy @xcite .",

    "we used subaru / focas to observe the two brightest optically dull agns of @xcite , 095849 + 013220 and 100036 + 024929 .",
    "the objects have multiwavelength observations from the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a survey based on a 1.7 deg@xmath16 hst / acs treasury program @xcite . both targets have identifications and redshifts from the xmm - cosmos agn spectroscopic campaign with magellan / imacs @xcite . despite their absorption line optical spectra ,",
    "they are confirmed as bona - fide agn using their xmm data @xcite : each has an x - ray luminosity of @xmath17 erg / s , requiring an agn @xcite .",
    "we show properties of 095849 + 013220 and 100036 + 024929 in table [ tbl : odagns ] .",

    "table [ tbl : odagns ] also gives the x - ray to optical flux ratios , given by @xmath19 .",
    "the second target , 100036 + 024929 , is a good candidate to be a normal agn diluted by a host galaxy because of its @xmath20 , fitting nicely in the traditional `` x - ray agn locus '' of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "however the first target , 095849 + 013220 , is anomalously x - ray bright and optically dull , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "since starlight dilution would increase the optical emission and decrease the @xmath24 ratio , the high @xmath24 ratio for the first target means it can not be explained by starlight dilution .",
    "instead 095849 + 013220 is a good candidate to host a riaf @xcite .",
    "spectropolarimetric observations of both targets were undertaken using the faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the 8.2-m subaru telescope .",
    "each target was observed for 6 hours of total integration in a @xmath25-wide center slit .",
    "we used the r58 filter and the 150 l / mm grism , resulting in an observed spectral range of 5800 - 10000  with @xmath62.8  / pixel resolution . during spectropolarimetry observations on focas ,",
    "a crystal quartz wallaston prism splits the incident light into ordinary and extraordinary components , which then pass through a rotating achromatic half - wave plate before being recorded simultaneously on the ccd .",
    "instrumental polarization of subaru / focas using the center slit is negligible ( @xmath26 ) , as confirmed by our unpolarized standard star exposures .",
    "the 6-hr observations were divided into 9 sets of 10-min exposures at each of 4 half - wave plate position angles @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "we used the unpolarized standard star g191b2b to flux calibrate and remove telluric absorption lines , and used the polarized standard star hd251204 @xcite to determine the absolute position angle .",
    "we reduced individual frames using the focas iraf cookbook , and then calculated the normalized flux difference for each individual frame : @xmath31 .",
    "we then combined the normalized flux difference for each angle @xmath32 and calculated the stokes parameters : @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we additionally computed the stokes parameters using the method of @xcite , which accounts for calibration differences between the `` ordinary '' and `` extraordinary '' light positions , and found no significant differences in the resultant q or u.    the degree of polarization is given by @xmath35 and the polarization angle by @xmath36 .",
    "errors in @xmath37 and @xmath38 bias the total polarization @xmath39 in the positive direction , and we correct for this bias using the simulation - derived correction of @xcite . galactic interstellar polarization is @xmath40 in the direction of both targets @xcite and is therefore disregarded .",
    "the total flux , degree of polarization , and polarization angle for the riaf candidate and dilution candidate agns are shown in figures [ fig : riafagn ] and [ fig : dilagn ] , respectively .",
    "we bin the degree of polarization and polarization angle by 20 pixels ( 56  in the observed frame ) to improve their signal - to - noise .",
    "it is first evident that several narrow emission lines are revealed in the unpolarized subaru / focas spectra , as compared to our previous magellan / imacs spectra with much lower s / n .",
    "the riaf candidate , 095849 + 013220 , may have weak  emission , although it is strangely blueshifted from the absorption line redshift .",
    "the diluted candidate , 100036 + 024929 , shows strong  and  emission ( which was missed in the previous magellan / imacs spectrum because of a chip gap ) and weak  and  emission .",
    "neither of the polarized fluxes in figures [ fig : riafagn ] and [ fig : dilagn ] show evidence for reflected agn emission lines like , , or",
    ". the @xmath415892 absorption feature might have increased percent polarization , although it is significant at only @xmath42 in both spectra .",
    "if the increased percent polarization of  is real , it is probably caused by the lower starlight dilution at that wavelength , and so does not represent an actual increase in polarized flux .",
    "the riaf candidate shows significant continuum polarization , while the diluted candidate does not .",
    "the mean continuum polarization of 095849 + 013220 is @xmath43 at an angle of @xmath44 degrees .",
    "the mean continuum polarization in the blue , measured at @xmath45 , is even stronger : @xmath46 . subtracting the host galaxy component , which contributes @xmath655% of the total emission at @xmath47 ,",
    "suggests that the mean polarization of the agn component is @xmath61.7% overall and @xmath63.0% in the blue .",
    "the polarized continuum roughly doubles from @xmath66500  to @xmath64500 , consistent with a typical unobscured quasar continuum of @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the two optically dull agns from cosmos , we observed the cluster bl lac candidate ms 1455-x2 from @xcite and discuss its spectropolarimetry results in the appendix .",
    "neither of our targets show evidence for polarized broad or narrow emission lines , which suggests that the lines are not missing due to anisotropic absorption as in a standard agn `` torus '' model @xcite .",
    "instead , our riaf candidate has a blue polarized continuum .",
    "here we place limits on polarized emission line flux and investigate the two possible causes of the continuum polarization : synchrotron emission or scattering .      for both objects the mean polarization in the wavelength regions of  or  broad lines are below or consistent with the measured continuum polarization in the surrounding regions .",
    "however a non - detection does not necessarily mean that there are no polarized emission lines , since very weak lines might be undetected within our errors .",
    "we approximate each line as a 2000  km / s wide top hat , and estimate upper limits on the degree of polarization for  and broad lines above the polarized continuum using the @xmath49 errors across the line region . for the riaf candidate 095849 + 013220",
    "the @xmath49 upper limits are @xmath50 for  and @xmath51 for , and for the diluted agn 100036 + 024929 the @xmath49 upper limits are @xmath52 for  and @xmath53 for .",
    "these upper limits decrease for broad lines wider than 2000  km / s .",
    "in contrast , `` hidden - blr '' agns typically have reflected broad emission lines detected at @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic fluxes from both broad lines and continuum are presumably represented in polarized emission . for the riaf candidate 095849 + 013220",
    "we detect a polarized continuum , and can determine upper limits in equivalent width ( ew ) for broad lines in this intrinsic agn emission .",
    "the @xmath49 upper limits on ew in the intrinsic emission are @xmath55  and @xmath56 .",
    "these limits are less than those of typical quasars , which have @xmath57  and @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "an anisotropic scatterer ( e.g. , the canonical agn `` torus '' ) is not the reason our two sources lack broad emission lines .",
    "instead both agns have weaker broad lines than typical type 1 or hidden - blr agns , consistent with a riaf or host galaxy starlight dilution .",
    "synchrotron emission from the anisotropic magnetic field associated with a radio jet has a high degree of linear polarization .",
    "the riaf candidate 095849 + 013220 could be analogous to bl lacertae agns , which similarly lack both direct and reflected emission lines .",
    "bl lacs typically exhibit linear polarization at @xmath59 , with a median of @xmath67% @xcite . at first glance",
    "the @xmath61.7% polarization for the agn - only component of 095849 + 013220 is in the low range of measured polarization for bl lacs .",
    "however the starlight dilution in 095849 + 013220 is not well constrained , and the polarization of the agn component might be significantly higher .",
    "synchrotron emission should extend from radio wavelengths to the optical / uv as a power - law , and so the resultant polarized flux should follow the same power - law ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the observed increase of polarized flux towards blue wavelengths for 095849 + 013220 seems to contradict this , but could again be explained by dilution from an old , red stellar population .",
    "the synchrotron polarization of bl lacs is also strongly variable in amplitude and angle @xcite , but we do not have multi - epoch polarization measurements and so can not perform this test .    many of the multiwavelength properties of our riaf candidate are also consistent with those of bl lacs .",
    "the agn 095849 + 013220 is radio - luminous ( though it sits just below the canonical radio - loudness definition ) : detected at @xmath60  mjy in the vla - cosmos survey @xcite , it has @xmath61 .",
    "this ratio is a factor of a few lower than typical radio to optical ratios for bl lacs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but again this can be explained if our starlight dilution estimate is too low .",
    "x - ray selected bl lacs ( hbls ) have similarly high @xmath24 ratios to 095849 + 013220 , although the typical @xmath24 of all bl lacs is lower and more like that of the typical quasar population @xcite .",
    "the polarized continuum adds another piece of evidence that 095849 + 013220 ( and possibly other optically dull agns with similarly high",
    "radio / optical and x - ray / optical ratios from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) might be unified with bl lacs as another kind of misaligned fr i radio galaxy @xcite",
    ".      scattering also causes continuum polarization , as the observer sees light reflected off the scattering surface .",
    "the polarized continuum of 095849 + 013220 , while blue , actually has the same @xmath62 slope as an unobscured quasar continuum .",
    "this slope suggests that optically thick clumpy dust clouds are responsible for the scattering .",
    "in contrast the wavelength dependence of optically thin dust scattering would cause a much bluer slope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and electron scattering would require a much larger gas mass than indicated by the x - ray column density ( @xmath63  @xmath11 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "scattering by clumpy dust is also thought to cause the polarized continuum observed in many type 1 and type 2 agns @xcite .",
    "the canonical agn `` torus '' is thought to be made of clumpy dust @xcite , and so could be the scatterer .",
    "the agn unified model invokes this torus to block and reflect the broad emission lines @xcite . in 095849 + 013220 , however , we observe a polarized continuum but no polarized emission lines .",
    "since the broad emission line region is @xmath64  pc from the continuum @xcite , it is not physically plausible for any scattering surface to reflect the continuum but not the emission lines .",
    "for this reason we interpret the detection of a polarized continuum without broad lines as evidence for a very weak or nonexistent blr , as expected for radiatively inefficient accretion @xcite .",
    "we present subaru / focas spectropolarimetry for two optically dull agns : the riaf candidate 095849 + 013220 and the galaxy - diluted type 2 agn candidate 100036 + 024929 . neither source exhibits reflected broad emission lines , with 3@xmath0 upper limits of @xmath652% polarized broad lines .",
    "this rules out simple torus obscuration as the reason behind the lack of broad emission lines . despite the lack of polarized broad line emission , in the riaf candidate we additionally observe a polarized continuum .",
    "the blue spectral slope of the polarized flux suggests that it represents the intrinsic agn continuum , either observed directly as synchrotron emission or as reflected by clumpy dust .",
    "because we observe the direct emission from the central agn engine without broad emission lines , we suggest that this source has an intrinsically weaker or nonexistent blr .",
    "the spectropolarimetry is another piece of evidence that the optically dull agn 095849 + 013220 has a radiatively inefficient accretion flow .",
