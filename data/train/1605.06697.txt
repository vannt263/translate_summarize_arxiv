    "a language is regular if and only if it has a finite number of distinct quotients .",

    "we examine both _ restricted complexity _ of binary operations , where the alphabets must be the same , and _ unrestricted complexity _ where they may differ .    to find the complexity of a unary operation one first finds an upper bound on this complexity , and then exhibits languages that meet this bound .",
    "since we require a language @xmath18 for each @xmath27 , we need a sequence @xmath28 ; here @xmath29 is usually a small integer because the bound may not hold for a few small values of @xmath19 .",

    "the complexities of the atoms of a regular language have been proposed as an additional measure  @xcite .",
