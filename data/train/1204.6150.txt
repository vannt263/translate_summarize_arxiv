    "this geometry gives the mode condition function @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the amplitude reflection coefficient for a wave impinging on the interface between medium @xmath8 and @xmath9 from the @xmath8 side , @xmath10 is the thickness of region @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the function @xmath13 is the dielectric function of medium @xmath8 and @xmath14 is the speed of light in vacuum . for planar structures",
    "there are two types of mode , transverse magnetic ( tm ) or p - polarized and transverse electric ( te ) or s - polarized .",

    "note that @xmath17 holds for both mode types .    in next section",

    "there are different formulations of electromagnetism in the literature .",
    "the difference lies in how the conduction carriers are treated . in one formulation",

    "then only the bound charges contribute to the screening .",
    "we want to be able to treat geometries with metallic regions .",

    "the unit vector * n * is the surface normal pointing into region @xmath11 .",
    "the amplitude reflection coefficient gets modified if there is a 2d layer at the interface .",
    "we treat the 2d layer at the interface as external to our system .",
    "the fields will then induce external surface charge and current densities at the interface .",
    "two of the boundary conditions are enough to get the modified fresnel coefficients .",
    "the other two are redundant .",
    "we choose the following two @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the conductivity of the 2d sheet .",
    "the modified amplitude reflection coefficient for a tm mode is @xmath23 where the polarizability of the 2d sheet is obtained from the dynamical conductivity @xmath24 and the dielectric function is @xmath25 for tm modes the tangential component of the electric field , which will induce the external current , is parallel to * k * , so the longitudinal 2d dielectric function of the layer enters .",
    "the bound charges in the 2d sheet also contribute to the dynamical conductivity and the polarizability .    the modified amplitude reflection coefficient for a te mode is @xmath26 where the polarizability of the 2d sheet is obtained from the dynamical conductivity @xmath27 and the dielectric function is @xmath28 for a te wave the electric field is perpendicular to * k * , so the transverse 2d dielectric function of the layer enters .",
    "the bound charges in the 2d sheet also contribute to the dynamical conductivity and the polarizability .",

    "the retardation effects are clearly present .     where also the non - retarded result has been added ( the thin solid curve with open circles.),width=302 ]    at t = 300k the te result decreases in strength and vanishes for large separations .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[figu13 ] .",
    "the tm contribution then dominates completely for large separations .",
    "the tm waves result in a contribution with half the strength of the total contribution in the ideal casimir geometry .",
    "the reason is that the static values of the graphene polarizability and the gold dielectric function diverges ; the tm reflection coefficients for a vacuum - graphene interface and a vacuum - gold interface are both equal to unity ; both te reflection coefficients are zero because @xmath79 and @xmath80 go to zero when the frequency goes towards zero .",
    "this is completely analogous both to the result for two doped free - standing graphene sheets and to the result in the real metal half - spaces geometry when the experimentally obtained dielectric functions are used or the drude model . here",
    "it is due both to spatial dispersion and to dissipation .",

    "an ideal metal substrate can be used as a reference system .",
    "it gives an upper limit for the interaction with real substrates .",
    "it is much easier to use than a real substrate since one avoids the complicated derivation of the dielectric function of the substrate on the imaginary frequency axis using kramers kronig dispersion relations .",
    "we include an ideal metal substrate for these reasons and for an additional reason .",

    "the reason is that the polarizabilty decays too slowly with frequency .    at finite temperature the frequency integration in eqs.([equ30 ] ) and ( [ equ31 ] ) is replaced by a discrete frequency summation as described in eq.([equ2 ] ) .      in the case of an undoped graphene sheet above an ideal metal substrate we see in eq.([equ30 ] ) that we may use the dummy variable change in both integrals and both the tm and te contributions follow the power law @xmath60 .",
    "this is verified in fig.[figu14 ] where the result for an undoped graphene sheet above an ideal metal substrate is shown . as can be seen",
    "the results are very similar to those for an undoped graphene sheet above a gold substrate , fig.[figu9 ] . here",

    "the room temperature results , t = 300k , are shown in fig.[figu17 ] . again",
    "the results are very similar to the ones for a doped graphene sheet above a gold substrate , fig.[figu13 ] . however , for smaller separations outside the figures also here the total result for the gold substrate has a smaller slope .",
    "we have here demonstrated how to incorporate 2d sheets in the formalism for planar structures .",
    "we applied the results to graphene systems .",
    "we found that for two free - standing undoped graphene sheets the retardation effects are negligible .",
    "the same holds for an undoped graphene sheet above a gold substrate .",
    "however , for doped graphene sheets , two free - standing or one free - standing above a gold substrate , the retardation effects are bound to be important at large enough separations . however , at t = 300k the retardation effects again go away .",
    "the retarded results for a graphene sheet above an ideal metal substrate are very similar to those for a graphene sheet above a gold substrate . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - retarded results do not exist , so there we have a drastic difference .",
    "we should furthermore note that the `` saturation effect '' at small separations found in the interaction between two 2d metallic sheets@xcite is absent in geometries involving undoped graphene sheets .",
    "this spatial dispersion effect , present also in the case of doped graphene sheets in the region where the doping carriers contribute , is due to the weakening of the screening in the sheet for large momenta .",
    "this happens for a momentum where the dispersion curve of the collective mode enters the single particle continuum . in the calculations for t = 300k we used the zero temperature polarizabilities for graphene .",
    "we estimate this to underestimate the large @xmath10 asymptote with less than one percent .",
    "furthermore , we used the longitudinal instead of transverse expressions for the graphene polarizabilities in the te contributions ; the reason for this is that nobody has derived the transverse versions , as far as we know ; we plan to do this in the future . however , the te contributions were found to be negligible in most situations .",
    "retarded results for graphene systems have been obtained by several groups@xcite before and santos@xcite has discussed the unimportance of retardation in graphene systems .",
    "we will here go through these results one by one and compare them to ours .",
    "the interaction between an undoped graphene sheet and an ideal metal substrate was studied in ref .. in their model they let graphene have a small but finite band gap and the carriers have non - zero mass .",
    "thus , the comparison with our results is meaningless .    in ref .",
    "one studied the force between undoped graphene sheets at zero temperature .",
    "they used a model where the conductivity is a constant , @xmath83 .",
    "this is the limiting form for @xmath84 , @xmath85 one has to be careful with this approximation , since it is not valid in the finite temperature @xmath67 term , which dominates at large separations .",
    "they gave in their eq.(36 ) , for the first term of a perturbation expansion whereupon @xmath86 is small , the expression @xmath87 which is very close to our result .",
    "note that it does not contain any material parameters .",
    "furthermore they showed in their fig .",
    "6 how their conductivity varied with temperature ; based on this result we concluded that we , to a good approximation , could use the zero temperature expression for the graphene polarizability in our room temperature calculations .    in ref .",
    "one studied the interaction between an undoped graphene sheet and a substrate ( gold and ideal metal ) at finite temperature .",
    "they used a different approach to the problem starting from a quantum - field - theory model at finite temperature and used different expansions .",
    "our results show an overall agreement .",
    "however , in the high temperature limit they put @xmath88 , which means that they use in that limit the same constant conductivity approximation used in ref .. this means that the graphene polarizability diverges at zero frequency and the tm reflection coefficient becomes unity .",
    "the result from this is that the interaction in this limit is half the corresponding value between two ideal metal half spaces , just as in the case of a doped graphene sheet above a gold or ideal metal substrate .",
    "we find a somewhat smaller value ( see figs.[figu10 ] and [ figu15 ] . )    in ref .",
    "one studied the interaction between undoped and doped graphene sheets at zero temperature and at 300 k ; also the interaction between a graphene sheet and a silica substrate was determined .",
    "our results disagree with theirs . for two undoped graphene sheets",
    "they find many distance regions , each with a different power law . in the doped case",
    "the effect of doping sets in at very small separations with a fractional power law while in our results it sets in at much larger separations ; their high temperature asymptote is much weaker than the ideal metal asymptote .",
    "we are convinced that their results are wrong . from the first appearance it looks as if they use exactly the same dielectric functions that we do for the undoped and doped graphene .",
    "after reading more carefully we believe that they have treated the strictly 2d sheets as layers of finite thickness , using the 2d dielectric functions in place of the bulk dielectric functions of the materials making up the layers .",
    "then they have let the layers have a small but finite thickness .",
    "this procedure is not allowed .    finally , in ref .",
    "the focus was on the change in force between a silica membrane and a metal plate when the membrane was covered by a graphene sheet .",
    "this work is just vaguely related to ours .",
    "we did not find anything that contradicts the findings in our present work .",
