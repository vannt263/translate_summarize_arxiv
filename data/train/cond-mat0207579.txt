    "the successful detection @xcite of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) in dilute weakly - interacting bosonic atoms employing magnetic trap at ultra - low temperature stimulated intense theoretical studies on different aspects of the condensate @xcite .",
    "the experimental magnetic trap could be either spherically symmetric or axially symmetric .",
    "the properties of an ideal condensate at zero temperature are usually described by the time - dependent , nonlinear , mean - field gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite which incorporates appropriately the trap potential as well as the interaction between the atoms forming the condensate .",
    "one of the problems of interest in bose - einstein condensation is the study of the oscillation in the condensate induced by a sudden change in the interaction acting on it .",
    "there have been both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies of the motion of the condensate under a sudden or continuous variation of the trapping frequencies .",
    "there has also been similar studies induced by a sudden variation of the atomic scattering length . in the latter class",
    "there have been experimental studies of explosive emission of atoms from a condensate when the scattering length is suddenly turned negative ( attractive ) from positive ( repulsive ) , thus leading to collapse and explosion of the condensate @xcite .",
    "this could also lead to the observation of a soliton train @xcite .",
    "there have been theoretical attempts to explain the dynamics of the condensate for collapse and explosion @xcite as well as for soliton train @xcite using the gp equation .",
    "resonance is an interesting feature of any oscillation under the action of an external periodic force manifesting in a very large amplitude .",
    "usually , a resonance appears when the frequency of the external periodic force becomes equal to that of the natural oscillation of the system @xcite .",
    "such a resonance appears in many areas of physics .",
    "there have been studies of resonance in different problems of linear dynamics and the appearance of resonance is well understood in these problems both analytically and numerically .",
    "the investigation of resonance in nonlinear dynamics is far more interesting and nontrivial .",
    "consequently , resonances in nonlinear problems are not so well understood .",
    "this makes the study of resonance in the dynamics generated by the nonlinear gp equation of general interest .",
    "apart from mere theoretical interest , such resonance in the oscillation of the bec governed by the gp equation can also be studied experimentally so that one can compare theoretical prediction with experiment .",
    "the possibility of generating a resonance in the oscillation of a bec subject to a varying trapping potential has been investigated theoretically @xcite .",
    "the variation of trapping potential in the gp equation corresponds to a linear external perturbation .",
    "here we investigate the resonance dynamics of the bec subject to a periodic variation of the scattering length , which should be considered as a nonlinear periodic force acting in the gp equation .",
    "such a variation of the scattering length is possible near a feshbach resonance by varying an external magnetic field @xcite . for experimentalists",
    "a periodic variation of the external magnetic field is easier to implement and the magnetic field is nonlinearly related to the scattering length .",
    "however , a simple periodic variation of the scattering length is a cleaner theoretical possibility and we shall apply such a variation in this study .",
    "the appearance of a resonance in the oscillation of a bec due to a periodic variation of the scattering length has been postulated recently in a spherically symmetric trap @xcite . here",
    "we present a complete study of the resonance dynamics in this case .",
    "in addition , we extend this investigation to the more realistic and complicated case of an axially symmetric trap as well as to vortex states in such a trap .    in the simplest case of a damped classical oscillator under a periodic external force with the natural frequency of oscillation , the resonance appears due a constant phase difference between the oscillation and the external force @xcite .",
    "this leads to a gradual increase in kinetic energy over each cycle of oscillation during an interval of time and hence in the amplitude of oscillation in this interval .",
    "eventually , the rate of loss of energy due to damping is exactly compensated for by the increase in energy from the external force and the oscillator oscillates with a large constant amplitude at large times at resonance .",
    "the constant phase difference between the external force and the oscillation is possible only at resonance when the two frequencies match and is necessary for resonance .",
    "the situation is much more complicated in the case of a trapped bec subject to a nonlinear external force due to a periodic variation in the scattering length . when subject to a sudden perturbation , the natural frequency of oscillation of a trapped spherical bec governed by the gp equation with nearly zero nonlinearity is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the frequency of the existing trap @xcite .",
    "this result is exact in the linear case @xmath3 .",
    "however , for the nonlinear problem @xmath4 , this natural frequency may change . in this paper we shall only be considering small nonlinearity where the natural frequencies can be taken approximately as @xmath1 . in physical analogy with the classical oscillator",
    ", a resonance is expected in the bec oscillation when the scattering length oscillates with frequency @xmath1 or its multiples . in our study",
    "we find that this is indeed the case .",
    "however , a much richer dynamics emerges in this case compared to the case of linear systems .",
    "we find that due to nonlinearity , the phase difference @xmath5 between the bec oscillation and the external nonlinear force varies with time .",
    "consequently , during a certain interval of time the bec may steadily gain energy from the external force in all cycles and the amplitude of oscillation may grow leading to a resonance . in the case of bec",
    "there is no damping and for a constant phase difference @xmath5 the amplitude is expected to grow beyond limit . however , as a result of the variation of the phase @xmath5 with time due the nonlinearity , after some time the system starts to lose energy due to the action of the external force .",
    "eventually , the oscillation of the the system can virtually stop .",
    "by that time the modified phase difference favors the increase of energy and the amplitude starts to grow again .",
    "consequently , the resonance of the system has a peculiar nature ; the amplitude of oscillation passes through pronounced maxima and minima . in a single classical damped oscillator",
    "this is not possible under the action of a periodic force @xcite .",
    "however , this is possible in case of a coupled system with exchange of energy between the two oscillators .",
    "we also investigate the resonant oscillation of an axially symmetric bec due to a periodic variation of the scattering length .",
    "when the frequency of oscillation of the scattering length equals the natural frequency of the radial or axial oscillation of the bec , we find resonance in the radial or axial oscillation , respectively .",
    "in section 2 we describe briefly the time - dependent gp equation with spherical and axial traps .",
    "the essential details of the split - step crank - nicholson method used for numerical solution is also described in this section . in section 3",
    "we report the numerical results of the present investigation of resonance for the spherically symmetric case . in section 4",
    "we present the same for the axially symmetric case for condensates with zero angular momentum as well as for vortex states with nonzero angular momentum .",
    "finally , in section 5 we present a discussion and summary of our study .",
    "at zero temperature , the time - dependent bose - einstein condensate wave function @xmath6 at position @xmath7 and time @xmath8 may be described by the following mean - field nonlinear gp equation @xcite @xmath9\\psi({\\bf r};\\tau)=0 .",

    "the wave function can be written as @xmath16 .",
    "after a transformation of variables to dimensionless quantities defined by @xmath17 , @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the gp equation in this case becomes @xmath21 \\varphi ( x , t)=0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 .",

    "we are using the cylindrical coordinate system @xmath28 with @xmath29 the azimuthal angle . in this case",
    "one can have quantized vortex states with rotational motion around the @xmath27 axis @xcite .",
    "in such a vortex the atoms flow with tangential velocity @xmath30 such that each atom has quantized angular momentum @xmath31 along @xmath27 axis . the wave function",
    "can then be written as : @xmath32 with @xmath33 .    using the above angular distribution of the wave function in ( [ a ] ) , in terms of dimensionless variables @xmath17 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 @xmath36 , and @xmath37 we get @xmath38\\varphi ( { x , y};t ) = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the normalization condition of the wave function is @xmath39      we solve the gp equation numerically employing a split - step time - iteration method using the crank - nicholson discretization scheme described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we discretize the gp equation spanning @xmath40 from 0 to 25 and @xmath41 from @xmath42 to 30 in the axially symmetric case . in the spherically symmetric case",
    "the range of @xmath40 integration was taken from 0 to 30 .",
    "this was enough for having a negligible value of the wave function at the boundaries . to calculate the solution for a specific nonlinearity @xmath43 the time iteration",
    "is started with the known harmonic oscillator solution of the gp equation for nonlinearity @xmath3 .",
    "these initial normalized solutions are @xmath44 @xmath45 ^{1/4}{x^{1+|l| } } e^{-(x^2+\\lambda y^2)/4}\\ ] ] for ( [ c ] ) and ( [ d ] ) , respectively .",
    "the nonlinearity is then slowly changed in steps of 0.0001 during each time iteration until the desired value of @xmath43 is attained . as a result in the course of time iteration the initial @xmath3 solution slowly converges towards the final solution with the desired @xmath43 .",
    "we study the formation of resonance in the oscillation of the condensate as the scattering length is varied periodically . in the scaled gp equations ( [ c ] ) and ( [ d ] ) the scattering length appears only through the nonlinearity parameter @xmath46 . in particular we consider the following variation of the nonlinearity parameter @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are two constants and @xmath50 is the frequency of variation of the nonlinear parameter .    in the gp equation ( [ c ] ) ,",
    "the scaled harmonic oscillator trap frequency is unity ; the radial and axial trap frequencies of ( [ d ] ) are 1 and @xmath51 , respectively . for zero and",
    "small values of nonlinearity the natural frequency of oscillation of ( [ c ] ) is twice the scaled trap frequency , which is 2 .",

    ". these natural frequencies of oscillation have been verified experimentally @xcite , as well as in theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "the perturbation ( [ e ] ) when applied to the gp equation behaves like a nonlinear external force acting in ( [ c ] ) and ( [ d ] ) .",
    "when the frequency @xmath50 of the perturbation coincides with the natural frequencies of oscillation of the gp equation , resonant behaviors are expected .",
    "the classic example of resonance appears when the parameter @xmath48 in ( [ e ] ) is zero . in that case",
    "resonances are expected in the spherically symmetric case for @xmath53 . in the axially symmetric case",
    "they are expected for @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the radial and axial oscillations , respectively . for @xmath55",
    ", resonances also appear provided that the constant @xmath49 is not very small .",
    "we study these possibilities in the next sections .",
    "first we consider the case with @xmath56 in ( [ e ] ) . in this case",
    "the maximum permitted value of @xmath49 is 0.575 . for @xmath57 , the minimum of nonlinearity",
    "@xmath43 could be less than @xmath58 .",
    "it is known that no stable solution of the spherically symmetric gp equation could be obtained for @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the domain of values @xmath59 corresponds to attractive interaction leading to collapse of the condensate .    in this case",
    "the natural frequency of oscillation of the condensate is 2 and resonances are expected for values of @xmath50 equaling multiples of 2 .",

    "in a problem of resonance of an uncoupled oscillator driven by a periodic external force the oscillator oscillates in phase with the external force .",
    "hence it gains energy during every cycle of oscillation and the amplitude of oscillation keeps on increasing .",
    "so a pertinent question to ask is how can the amplitude of oscillation decrease in the present problem . in this nonlinear problem",
    "the phase between the oscillation at resonance and the external force varies with time .",

    "due to the nonlinearity in the equation the system moves in and out of resonance when a constant frequency drive is applied .",

    "only the first time scale appears and the second frequency is absent . at resonance",
    "the second frequency should increase with the effective nonlinearity of the system although a simple relation between the two can not be obtained . for @xmath56 the effective nonlinearity increases with increasing @xmath49 and at resonance the second frequency",

    "we demonstrate that interesting resonating oscillation can be generated in the condensate if the scattering length is varied periodically with a given frequency .",
    "this oscillation may be verified experimentally and novel and interesting phenomena may emerge as a consequence of such verification .",
    "mathematically , the periodically oscillating scattering length in the gp equation can be considered as an external nonlinear periodic driving force in the linear schrdinger equation , which is an interesting problem of quantum mechanics and deserves special attention .",
    "here we have considered a full numerical approach to its solution and have revealed interesting results .",
    "one could also employ an analytic perturbative procedure for its solution when the coefficient of the external force is small .",
    "this would be a problem of future interest .",
    "we found that resonances with novel feature can appear in the oscillation of the bec from a periodic variation of the scattering length when the frequency of the oscillation of scattering length @xmath50 coincides with a multiple of the natural frequency of oscillation of the harmonically trapped bec .",
    "for a spherically symmetric condensate , the natural frequency of oscillation of the bec is twice the trapping frequency ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "hence resonances in the bec oscillation appear for @xmath115 etc . for an axially symmetric bec , the natural frequency of oscillation of the bec in radial and axial directions are twice the trapping frequencies in these directions , which are @xmath114 and @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "consequently , resonances in the bec oscillation in the radial and axial directions appear for @xmath115 and @xmath117 , respectively .",
    "the interesting feature of these resonances is that even in the absense of any damping ( dissipative force ) , the amplitude of oscillation at resonance can grow and reduce with time .",
    "such growth and decay cycle of the amplitude may repeat several times .",
    "the period of such growth and decay cycles is @xmath118 units of dimensionless time , which under usual experimental condition with @xmath119 hz / s corresponds to about 0.2 s @xmath111 a period that can be precisely measured and compared with theoretical prediction to test the mean - field theory .",
    "we hope that the present investigation may stimulate further theoretical and experimental studies on this topic .",
