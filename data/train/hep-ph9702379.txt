    "one of the most important frontiers in strong interaction physics is the study of the structure of the nucleon . despite considerable experimental and theoretical progress made over the last forty years",
    ", there are still many unanswered questions .",
    "an example is the intensive debate which has continued over the spin structure of the nucleon , ever since the european muon collaboration ( emc ) published their initial data on the spin structure function @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "traditionally , two types of observables related to the nucleon structure have been studied mostly extensively : elastic form factors and parton ( quark and gluon ) distributions .",
    "electromagnetic form factors of the proton were first measured in the mid 1950s @xcite , and in recent years measurements of those of the neutron have been attempted and more are planned @xcite .",
    "weak form factors are also being measured through parity - violating electron and neutrino scattering @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the unpolarized quark and gluon distributions have been systematically probed in deep - inelastic scattering and drell - yan processes since the discovery of quarks at slac in the late 1960s .",
    "the polarized quark distributions have also been studied in a number of experiments in recent years @xcite , and more data on these are anticipated in the future from cern , slac , hera and rhic .    in this paper , we present a first detailed study of a new type of nucleon observable : the off - forward parton distribution ( ofpd ) .",
    "the ofpds generalize and interpolate between the ordinary parton distributions , measured for instance in deep - inelastic scattering , and the elastic form factors , and therefore contain rich structural information .",
    "there are no data so far on these distributions , and a relatively short theoretical history .",
    "to our knowledge , the ofpds have come up independently in three different theoretical studies . in the late 1980s ,",
    "geyer and collaborators @xcite studied the relation between the altarelli - parisi evolution for parton distributions and the brodsky - lepage evolution for leading - twist meson wave functions .",
    "the `` interpolating functions '' introduced in ref.@xcite are essentially the ofpds which we study in this paper . in the early 1990s , jain and ralston @xcite studied hard processes involving hadron helicity flip , in terms of an `` off - diagonal transition amplitude '' involving off - forward matrix elements of bi - quark fields in the nucleon .",
    "it was shown that the integral of this amplitude over the quark four - momentum yielded elastic form factors . recently ,",
    "one of us @xcite introduced ofpds in the study of the spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "the main observations in refs.@xcite were that the fractions of the spin carried by quarks and gluons can be determined from form factors of the qcd energy - momentum tensor , and that the latter can be extracted from the ofpds .",
    "furthermore , the deeply - virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) process was proposed @xcite as a practical way to measure the new distributions .    from the point of view of parton physics in the infinite momentum frame ,",
    "the ofpds have the following meaning : if a nucleon is moving with an infinite momentum in a particular direction , take out a parton with a certain fraction of the momentum , give it a four - momentum transfer @xmath1 , and insert it back into the nucleon .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "the ofpd is then the amplitude characterizing this process . on the other hand , from the point of view of elastic form factors ,",
    "the moments of ofpds are form factors of twist - two quark and gluon operators . for the spin-1 operators",
    "one has the ordinary electromagnetic and axial form factors , while for the spin-2 operators one has the form factors of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "because the form factors of the tensor contain information about the quark and gluon contributions to the nucleon angular momentum , the ofpds can provide information on the fraction of the nucleon spin carried by quark orbital angular momentum  a subject of considerable current interest @xcite .",
    "the ofpds can be measured in diffractive processes in which the nucleon recoils elastically after receiving some momentum transfer .",
    "moreover , one must have in the processes a hard , light - like momentum so that the parton light - cone correlations are selected .",
    "the simplest such process is dvcs @xcite , in which a deeply - virtual photon , supplied by inelastic electron scattering , hits the nucleon and turns into a real , high energy photon .",
    "such a process is easy to analyze theoretically and is similar to ordinary deep - inelastic scattering .",
    "more complicated processes include diffractive meson production , in which one must deal in addition with meson light - cone wave functions @xcite ( these have recently been shown by collins et al.@xcite to be factorizable ) .",
    "the best experimental facility to carry out dvcs experiments is the proposed elfe @xcite .",
    "however , some studies can already be made at hera ( the hermes collaboration ) , and at jefferson lab with a 6 gev electron beam .    in planning",
    "future dvcs experiments , it is important to have a theoretical estimate of the ofpds .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to perform a first analysis of the ofpds in the mit bag model @xcite . to be sure",
    ", the model has a number of well - known problems , including breaking of chiral symmetry and translational invariance , absence of explicit gluon degrees of freedom , etc .",
    "nonetheless , it contains quarks ; it predicts well the hadron spectrum ; it gives reasonable initial input for quark distributions @xcite ; and it can describe the electromagnetic form factors @xcite of the nucleon",
    ". other models of which we are aware have an equally long list of problems and do not seem to provide any obvious advantage for estimating the quark distributions .",
    "after firstly reviewing in section ii the definitions of the off - forward parton distributions and some of their general properties , we present in section iii the results of the bag model for their dependence on the various kinematic variables .",
    "the calculation accounts for the lorentz boost and spectator quark effects . in section",
    "iv we analyze the form factors of the energy - momentum tensor , and evaluate their @xmath2 dependence . finally , conclusions are noted in section v , and possible extensions of this work outlined .",
    "in this section we review the definitions and model independent results for the ofpds and their moments discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "other definitions of ofpds exist in the literature @xcite , however , the definition introduced in ref.@xcite has a number of advantages , such as explicit hermiticity , and a simple connection with local operators and their form factors .",
    "we shall henceforth use the definition from ref.@xcite .",
    "the ofpds can be defined for both quarks and gluons , however , in this paper we focus primarily on quark distributions , since the description of the wave function of gluons in the nucleon is a much more difficult problem .    to start , consider the bilocal operator @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a scalar parameter , @xmath5 is a quark field of a certain flavor , and @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "the light - like vector @xmath8 is proportional to @xmath9 , with a coefficient depending on the choice of coordinates .",
    "the gauge link @xmath10 is along a straight line segment extending from one quark field to the other , which makes the bilocal operator gauge invariant . in the following , we work in the light - like gauge , @xmath11 , so that the gauge link can be ignored .",
    "one can now proceed to take the matrix element of the bilocal operator between the nucleon states of momenta @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath1 is the four - momentum transfer .",
    "the matrix element must be expressible in terms of nucleon spinors , dirac matrices , and the four - vectors @xmath12 , @xmath1 and @xmath8 .",
    "since we are only interested in the leading - twist contributions which are proportioanl to @xmath12 or @xmath14 in the infinite momentum frame , we keep terms that are non - vanishing after multiplication by @xmath8 @xcite :    [ def ] @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the nucleon spinor , and the dots ( @xmath19 ) denote higher - twist contributions .",
    "it is possible to construct other dirac structures that appear to be leading - twist , however , using gordon identities and throwing away sub - leading terms one can always reduce these to the form in eqs.([def ] ) .",
    "the structures in eqs.([def ] ) are the same as those in the definition of the nucleon s elastic form factors .",
    "examination of the helicity structure of quark  nucleon scattering shows that there are exactly four independent amplitudes .",
    "the chiral - even distributions @xmath20 and @xmath21 survive in the forward limit in which the nucleon helicity is conserved , while the chiral - odd distributions @xmath22 and @xmath23 arise from the nucleon helicity flip associated with a finite momentum transfer .",
    "the ofpds are depicted graphically in fig .  1 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the four - momenta of the active partons .",
    "the physical meaning of the distributions becomes clearer if one introduces a conjugate light - like vector @xmath26 of @xmath8 , with @xmath27 .",
    "expanding @xmath28 and @xmath29 in terms of the vectors @xmath26 and @xmath8 then gives :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 , and the spatial components of @xmath32 have been chosen along the @xmath33-direction .",
    "if we focus on the @xmath26 components of the momenta , the initial and final nucleons have longitudinal momenta @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and the outgoing and incoming quarks carry @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively . since the nucleon can not have negative longitudinal momentum , the limit on @xmath38 is obviously : @xmath39 a more careful analysis using @xmath40 leads to the more stringent constraint @xmath41 . on the other hand ,",
    "since quarks can not carry more logitudinal momentum than the parent nucleon , one has the constraint on @xmath42 : @xmath43 when @xmath44 both quark propagators in fig .",
    "1 represent quarks . when @xmath45 they represent antiquarks . in these regions ,",
    "the ofpds are analogous to the usual parton distributions . in the intermediate region , @xmath46 ,",
    "the quark propagators contain one quark and one antiquark , and here the distributions resemble a meson s wave function amplitude .",
    "the off - forward parton distributions display characteristics of both the forward parton distributions and nucleon form factors .",
    "in fact , in the limit of @xmath47 , one finds @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the forward quark and quark helicity distributions , defined through similar light - cone correlations @xcite .",
    "it must be pointed out that while the @xmath47 limit is quite simple and natural for the ofpds , it can not be taken literally for the kinematics of the dvcs process , where a finite @xmath2-channel momentum transfer is essential to simultaneously maintain the initial photon deeply - virtual , and the final state photon real .",
    "on the other hand , the first moment of the off - forward distributions are related to the nucleon form factors by the following sum rules @xcite :    [ sum1 ] @xmath51    here @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the dirac and pauli form factors , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the axial - vector and pseudo - scalar form factors of the nucleon .",
    "the @xmath42-integrated distributions on the left - hand - side of eqs.([sum1 ] ) are in fact independent of @xmath38",
    ". the sum rules ( [ sum1 ] ) provide important constraints on any model calculation of the ofpds .",
    "generalizing the sum rules ( [ sum1 ] ) , let us multiply eq.([hedef ] ) by @xmath56 and integrate @xmath42 from @xmath57 to @xmath58 , which gives : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and likewise for @xmath61 .",
    "the derivative @xmath62 is defined as @xmath63 where    @xmath64    the left - hand - side of eq.([nnnn ] ) is an off - forward matrix element of the twist - two operator @xmath65 where the braces @xmath66 represent symmetrization of indices .",
    "on general grounds , a matrix element of @xmath67 is a sum of terms composed of form factors ( which are functions of @xmath2 only ) , appropriate lorentz structures constructed from @xmath32 , @xmath1 and the dirac matrices , and nucleon spinors .",
    "the @xmath38 dependence in eq.([nnnn ] ) arises only from contracting a vector @xmath1 in any of the lorentz structures with the null vector @xmath8 .",
    "therefore the @xmath38 dependence of the moments of the ofpds is in the form of polynomials . to find the degree of the polynomials , notice that there are at most @xmath68 contractions of @xmath8 with @xmath1 in the @xmath68-th moment .",
    "thus @xmath69 and @xmath61 are polynomials of degree @xmath68 in @xmath38 , a result which is not obvious from the definition itself .",
    "the same considerations apply to the bilocal operator with @xmath70 dependence .",
    "in this section , we present a calculation of the ofpds in a simple version of the mit bag model @xcite . as mentioned in the introduction , our choice of the mit bag is based on the fact that it has quark degrees of freedom , and gives reasonable results for the electromagnetic form factors @xcite , as well as for polarized and unpolarized parton distributions @xcite .",
    "however , being a model , it has a number of unwanted artifacts , such as a sharp boundary , absence of gluons , and the breaking of translational invariance and chiral symmetry .",
    "nonetheless , we believe that our results should provide a reasonable first guess of the unknown distributions at a low energy scale , @xmath71(0.2 gev@xmath72 ) .",
    "there are , of course , many other nucleon models on the market in which the ofpds could be calculated , however , we see no clear reason that these models would be more reliable than that considered here . the issue of evolution of the distributions to higher energy scales will be addressed in a separate publication .",
    "when evaluating the ofpds and form factors , it is convenient to work in the breit frame , in which the initial and final momenta of the nucleon are : @xmath73 the @xmath2-channel momentum transfer squared becomes : @xmath74 using eqs.(2 ) , we then have : @xmath75 the variable @xmath38 in this frame is therefore related to the projection of @xmath76 in the @xmath33 direction , @xmath77 for calculations in a model without exact translational invariance , the choice of frame is part of the model assumptions . in principle",
    ", a different result could be obtained if , for instance , one chose instead a frame where the initial nucleon was at rest .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the main features of our result will be weakly frame dependent , as in many other similar types of calculations .",
    "recall that the coordinate space wave function of a quark in the rest frame of the mit bag is given by : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the bag radius , @xmath80 is the quark energy , and @xmath81 is lowest frequency solution of the bag eigenequation , @xmath82 .",
    "the functions @xmath83 are the spherical bessel functions ( @xmath84 ) , and @xmath85 is the quark spinor .",
    "the normalization @xmath86 is given by : @xmath87 the radius in the basic version of the bag model is given by the relation :  @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "calculation of the ofpds requires wave functions of a moving nucleon .",
    "one must therefore boost the rest frame wave function ( [ wfn_r ] ) to a frame moving with velocity @xmath89 . including the time dependence of the quark wave function explicitly , @xmath90 , the effect of a lorentz boost on the wave function",
    "can be represented by @xcite : @xmath91 where @xmath92 here the rapidity @xmath93 is related to the velocity by@xmath94 , where @xmath95 . in the breit frame",
    "the velocity of the initial nucleon is @xmath96 , so that @xmath97 here we basically treat the independent quarks in the bag as free particles , ignoring the fact that they are confined by the bag boundary , which again is a part of the model assumptions .    in practical calculations",
    ", it will be more convenient to use a momentum space wave function , @xmath98 , which is simply related to the coordinate space wave function @xmath99 by a fourier transformation : @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , with @xmath104 .",
    "the momentum space wave function is given by : @xmath105 where @xmath106 , and the functions @xmath107 are given by :    @xmath108    one of the most important issues in calculating the off - forward matrix elements of single - particle operators in independent particle models like the bag is momentum conservation . in the following",
    ", we discuss this issue in some detail , which in the end will motivate the approach we take in performing the calculation . in independent particle models , strictly speaking the form factors of any one - body operator must be zero .",
    "since the momentum transfer through the one - body operator affects the active quark only , the remaining spectator quarks maintain their original states . on the other hand , if a momentum transfer @xmath109",
    "is given to the whole nucleon , each of the quarks must receive a momentum transfer @xmath110 , since before and after the interaction , the model nucleon must move as a whole .",
    "thus , due to the momentum mismatch , the form factors must vanish . in the realistic situation",
    ", however , the nucleon wave function contains correlations .",
    "the momentum transfer injected to a single quark is in turn transferred through correlations to the other constituents , and asymptotically is equally shared among them . in independent particle models , however , these vital correlations needed for form factor calculations are missing .    in the literature",
    ", several common approaches have been adopted to deal with this issue . in one approach ,",
    "model wave functions with no definite center - of - mass momentum are used @xcite .",
    "form factors are calculated from a fourier component of the single particle operator , @xmath111 . in this type of calculation , the momentum transfer to the model nucleon and to the individual quarks is not well defined . if a boosted single - particle wave function is used , roughly speaking , the momentum transfer to each spectator quark is @xmath112 . on the other hand ,",
    "the momentum transfer through the active quark is approximately @xmath113 , which arises from the combined effects of boost and the action of the single - particle operator .",
    "( the relative sign of the two effects appears somewhat counterintuitive , but is nonetheless correct . )    in principle , a better approach would be to use initial and final nucleon wave functions with definite momentum , which can be approximately obtained , for instance , through the peierls - yoccoz projection @xcite or the center - of - mass freedom separation method@xcite .",
    "in such calculations , all quarks share equally the momentum transfer to the nucleon .",
    "in particular , the active quark in which the single - particle operator acts is injected with a momentum @xmath112 only .",
    "since the state of the two spectator quarks also changes from the initial to the final nucleon , the effective operator which induces such a transition is actually a three - body operator .",
    "a calculation of the ofpds incorporating the effects of lorentz boosts and projections is rather involved , and in practice not particularly illuminating .",
    "instead , we consider a simpler alternative , by modifying the momentum transfer through the active quark in the approach of ref.@xcite .",
    "namely , we let the effetive momentum transfer through the active quark be @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is taken to be a parameter . as mentioned above , @xmath116 in an unprojected calculation . ultimately , @xmath115 in our calculation will be determined by fitting the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon , but one can expect @xmath115 to be around 1/3 , in the spirit of the momentum - projected calculation discussed above .",

    "this role of the form factors of the total energy - momentum tensor has been first noted by jaffe and manohar @xcite .",
    "measuring the form factors of the energy - momentum tensor in practice is very difficult , partly because there is no fundamental probe which couples to them .",
    "( the graviton does , but only to the total tensor . ) because of asymptotic freedom , the form factors can be measured through deep - inelastic sum rules , as explained in ref.@xcite . according to our definition of ofpds",

    "however , reaching small @xmath2 in real experiments will be difficult ; so some knowledge of the @xmath2 dependence of the form factors is essential . in the remainder of this section , we will present a detailed calculation of the form factors of the ( quark flavor - singlet part of the ) energy - momentum tensor in the bag model . in principle , one can already obtain the form factors from the sum rules ( [ sumxh])([sum2 ] ) .",
    "however , here we will present an independent derivation , from which not only can one check the calculations on ofpds , but also obtain the form factors not accessible from the above sum rules .",

    "11 this is illustrated by the dotted curve . with a lorentz boost and a momentum transfer fraction to the quark @xmath207",
    ", the value of @xmath208 is no longer unity .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the boosted bag wave function does not have the correct lorentz symmetry . for a smaller value @xmath209 ( solid )",
    "one finds that @xmath206 at @xmath148 is now @xmath210 .",

    "the @xmath2 dependence of form factors is controlled by the nearest singularities in @xmath2-channel . for @xmath212 ,",
    "the quantum number of the channel is the exotic state with @xmath213 .",
    "there is no conclusive evidence at the present time for the existence of resonances in this channel , although theoretical investigations indicate that hybrid @xmath214 mesons could exist in the mass range of 1.3 to 1.9 gev @xcite .",
    "if the dispersive behavior of @xmath212 is dominated by large - mass resonances , then @xmath206 will vary slowly with @xmath2 , at least noticeably slower than the electromagnetic form factor .",
    "although the bag calculation does indicate such a trend , the evidence is not strong .",
    "we suspect therefore that either the @xmath2 dependence of the bag prediction is not reliable , or multi - pion cuts in the form factor are important .",
    "further study in this direction is called for .    to obtain the individual form factors @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath201",
    ", one can take other components of the tensor @xmath199 .",

    "12 the resulting form factors as a function of @xmath2 for @xmath143 .",
    "all form factors fall off monotonically as @xmath225 increases , with @xmath226 being the largest ( and positive ) , and others relatively smaller ( and negative ) .",
    "note that for a radius @xmath227 , the form factor @xmath228 , which according to the definition of the form factors simply reflects the fact that all the momentum of the nucleon is carried by quarks .",
    "the trace condition on the quark part of the bag energy - momentum tensor implies that not all of the form factors are independent .",
    "in fact , it is easy to show that , @xmath229 we have checked that this relation is in fact satisfied to a very good approximation in the bag model , despite the violation of lorentz symmetry after boosts .",
    "the above equation indicates that the normalization of the non - conserving form factor is fixed to @xmath230 .",
    "it must be pointed out , however , that the above relation is not true in qcd because the renormalized quark part of the energy - momentum tensor has a trace anomaly @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have presented a detailed study of a new class of nucleon observables , the off - forward parton distributions .",
    "the physical significance of the distriubtions has been explained in a partonic language , and their relations to form factors of twist - two operators made explicit .",
    "the @xmath38 dependence of the moments of the ofpds is found to have a rather simple polynomial form .",
    "we have made the first model calculation of the distributions using the mit bag model , with the specific details of the model fixed by requiring one to reproduce the electromagnetic form factors of the proton , and the gross features of the parton distributions at a low energy scale . in relation to the spin structure of the nucleon",
    ", we have also studied the form factors of the energy - momentum tensor in the bag model , focusing on the @xmath2 dependence in the range of 0 to 2 gev@xmath72 .",
    "the model calculation includes the effects of lorentz boosts of the quark wave function , and spectator quarks .",
    "the @xmath38 dependence of the distributions turns out to be extremely weak , indicating that the form factors of the twist - two operators associated with the lorentz structure @xmath231 are dominant .",
    "the @xmath2 dependence of the ofpds , on the other hand , is much stronger , and roughly follows that of the elastic form factors .",
    "our results for the combination @xmath206 of the tensor form factors provide the first concrete indication of their possible @xmath2 dependence , which will be important for the extraction of the value at @xmath148 , since this gives the total angular momentum carried by quarks in the nucleon .",
    "an important issue to be addressed in future is the @xmath232 evolution of the ofpds .",
    "it is well known that the bag model calculations of the forward parton distributions are valid only at very low energy scales , @xmath233 gev@xmath72 , therefore the ofpds calculated in this paper can not be used directly to estimate the experimental cross sections .",
    "the evolution equations for the off - forward distributions , which interpolate the brodsky - lepage @xcite and dglap @xcite evolution equations , have been derived in refs.@xcite .",
    "the technology for solving these new evolution equations is currently being developed .",
    "apart from the evolution , the model calculations of the ofpds could also be refined in future by including lorentz boosts together with momentum projections .",
    "the most relevant experiment from which the off - forward distributions and tensor form factors can be extracted is deeply - virtual compton scattering @xcite . in practice",
    ", the dvcs process will be overwhelmed at small @xmath2 by the bethe - heitler process , whose cross section has a qed infrared divergence at @xmath148 , so that one can not go to too small @xmath2 .",
    "one may get around this to some extent by subtracting the ( calculable ) bethe - heitler contribution , or by isolating the virtual compton and bethe - heitler interference term @xcite through single - spin asymmetry or combined lepton - antilepton scattering @xcite . other processes which can also provide information on the ofpds include diffractive @xmath234 and @xmath235 production @xcite , which are sensitive to the off - forward gluon distribution .",
    "a series of dedicated experiments at suitable machines , such as hermes , elfe , or at jefferson lab , can in future explore these new distributions , and thus provide valuable information on the distribution of spin in the nucleon .",
