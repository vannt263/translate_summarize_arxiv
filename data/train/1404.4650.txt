    "recent theoretical proposals , predicting a significant improvements in the laser gyro sensitivity with the use of a `` white - light '' cavity  @xcite , have motivated a number of theoretical and experimental studies of negative dispersion in various systems  @xcite .",
    "a promising approach relies on manipulation of optical dispersion via coherent interactions of light with resonant atomic media .",
    "processes like electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) , stimulated raman scattering ( srs ) , four - wave mixing ( fwm ) , etc . , are known to enable group index @xmath0 variation from subluminal ( `` slow light '' , @xmath1 ) to superluminal ( `` fast light '' , @xmath2 )  @xcite .",
    "demonstration of a white - light laser gyroscope requires a gain medium with group index tunable around @xmath3 .",
    "several experimental groups have pursued various approaches for the realization of such conditions  @xcite .",
    "recently our groups demonstrated that the fast light regime with amplification can be achieved in a four - level _",

    "the possibility of probe field propagation with no optical losses or with gain , with a smooth transition between slow- and fast - light regimes by varying the strength of one of the pump fields ( @xmath7 ) was theoretically demonstrated  @xcite , making it an ideal test bed for explorations of the dispersion effects in a ring cavity laser for gyroscope applications .

    "in conclusion , we have analyzed the propagation of a weak resonant probe through a medium of four - level atoms in an _",
    "n_-scheme with allowed four - wave mixing generation , and found it to be a promising candidate for the realization of tunable `` slow - to - fast '' light with no absorption .",
    "this is particularly interesting for the experimental investigation of potential techniques for the enhancement of optical - gyroscope performance .",
