    "consider a preparation device which prepares a state conditioned on a single measurement .",
    "for simplicity , we employ two subsystems . one subsystem will be measured , leaving a quantum state in the other .",
    "it is clear that prior to the measurement the two systems have to be entangled . otherwise conditioning on the measurement",
    "does not have any effect on the state of the second system .",
    "we can write the total state @xmath17 prior to the measurement in the schmidt decomposition : @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 orthonormal sets of states for system 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "these states correspond to eigenstates of observables @xmath21 and @xmath22 with sets of eigenvalues @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "we now measure the observable @xmath21 in system 1 , yielding an outcome @xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:4.0 ] ) .",
    "we can model this measurement using so - called projection operator valued measures , or povm s for short .",
    "for _ ideal _ measurements , we can describe the measurement of mode 1 as a projection @xmath26 operating on the state @xmath17 .",
    "when we trace out the first system the ( normalised ) state of the second system will be @xmath27}{{\\rm tr}_{12 } [ ( p_k\\otimes{\\unity})|\\psi\\rangle_{12 }   \\langle\\psi| ] } = |b_k\\rangle\\langle b_k|\\ ; .\\ ] ]    for non - ideal measurements we do not use a projection operator , but rather a _ projection operator valued measure_. in general , a povm @xmath28 can be written as @xcite @xmath29 where the @xmath30 s form a set ( possibly over - complete , hence the difference in notation from @xmath31 ) of projection operators @xmath32 .",
    "we also require a completeness relation @xmath33    as mentioned before , a measurement outcome @xmath25 in mode 1 gives rise to an outgoing state @xmath34 in mode 2 .",
    "we can not describe a non - ideal measurement with the projection @xmath26 .",
    "instead , we have a povm @xmath35 ( corresponding to the outcome @xmath25 ) , which reduces to @xmath31 in the case of an ideal measurement .",
    "let @xmath36 , the entangled state prior to the measurement . the outgoing state in mode",
    "@xmath9 will then be @xmath37}{{\\rm    tr}[(e_k\\otimes{\\unity})\\rho_{12}]}\\ ; , \\ ] ] where the total trace over both systems in the denominator gives the proper normalisation .",
    "if we had an ideal detector ( corresponding to @xmath38 ) , the outgoing state would be @xmath39 .",
    "however , with the general povm @xmath35 , this will not be the case",
    ". the resulting state will be different . in order to quantify the reliability of a state preparation process we introduce the _ confidence _ of a process .",
    "definition : : :    the _ confidence _ in the preparation of a particular state is given by    the fidelity of the preparation process .",
    "that means that using eqs .",
    "( [ 4schmidt ] ) and ( [ 4rhoout ] ) the confidence @xmath40 is given by @xmath41}{{\\rm    tr}[(e_k\\otimes{\\unity})\\rho_{12 } ] } = \\frac{|c_k|^2 \\langle a_k| e_k    |a_k\\rangle}{\\sum_l |c_l|^2 \\langle a_l| e_k |a_l\\rangle}\\ ; , \\ ] ] where the @xmath42 are the diagonal elements of the density matrix . in the context of measurement and state identification ,",
    "the fidelity is a widely used and well - studied concept @xcite .",
    "since the confidence is defined as the fidelity of the preparation process , these results also apply here .",
    "we prefer the term confidence in this context , because it is reminiscent of the confidence in statistics @xcite .",
    "statistical confidence denotes the probability that the value of a quantity lies within a fixed interval around the observed mean value . in this paper",
    ", we extend this meaning to the quantum mechanical case .",
    "it is the probability that the _ prepared _ state passes a projective test for the _ expected _ state in a single - shot experiment .    the confidence @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ conf1 ] ) can be interpreted as the probability of obtaining outcome @xmath25 from the ` branch ' containing @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ 4schmidt ] ) divided by the unconditional probability of obtaining outcome @xmath25",
    ". we will also call this the ` confidence of state preparation ' .",
    "this interpretation suggests that there does not need to be a second system to give the idea of confidence meaning .",
    "suppose , for instance , that we have an ` electron factory ' which produces electrons with random spin .",
    "a stern - gerlach apparatus in the path of such an electron will make a spin measurement along a certain direction * r*. suppose we find that the electron has spin ` up ' along * r*. before this measurement the electron was in a state of random spin ( @xmath44 ) , and after the measurement the electron is in the ` spin up ' state ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the state of the electron has _ collapsed _ into the ` spin up ' state .",
    "we will now investigate how we can define the confidence of the detection of a single system .",
    "formally , we can model state collapse by means of the super - operator @xmath46 , where @xmath25 is again the outcome of the measurement of observable @xmath21 ( ` spin up ' in the above example ) . in general , a super - operator yields a ( non - normalised ) mapping @xmath47 ( see fuchs and peres @xcite and references therein ) . when the eigenstate corresponding to @xmath25 is given by @xmath43 , we can define the confidence of this measurement as @xmath48 } = \\frac{{\\rm tr}[\\hat{\\mathcal{f}}_{a_k }   ( \\rho)|a_k\\rangle\\langle a_k|]}{{\\rm tr}[\\hat{\\mathcal{f}}_{a_k}(\\rho)]}\\ ; , \\ ] ] with @xmath49 $ ] the proper normalisation .",
    "however , this expression depends strongly on the details of the family of operators @xmath50 .",
    "this is a more complicated generalisation than the povm s @xmath35 .",
    "the confidence of state preparation , on the other hand , is a function of the povm @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath51 will in general _ not _ be equal to the confidence of state preparation derived in eq .",
    "( [ conf1 ] ) .    in conclusion",
    ", there are two distinct versions of the confidence : the confidence of _ measurement _ and the confidence of _ state preparation_. later in this paper we will use the concept of the confidence to make a quantitative comparison between different detection devices .",
    "this suggests that we need to calculate the confidence of measurement with all its difficulties .",
    "one way to circumvent this problem is to calculate the the confidence of state preparation using a fixed state . instead of concentrating on the state preparation process",
    "we now choose a standard input state and calculate the confidence for different types of measurement devices .",
    "one such choice might be the maximally entangled state @xmath52 when @xmath53 , this is perhaps not the ideal choice and another state may be preferred . for any choice , the confidence offers a quantitative measure of performance for different types of measurement devices .",
    "having set the stage for state preparation conditioned on measurement outcomes , we will now restrict the remainder of this paper to optical implementations .",
    "let s consider the measurement of optical fock states using photo - detectors .",
    "in order to classify different types of detectors we use the following terminology : a detector is said to have a _ single - photon sensitivity _ when it is sensitive enough to detect a single - photon wave - packet .",
    "this is the case with , for example , the avalanche photo - detector .",
    "when a detector can distinguish between @xmath54- and @xmath55-photon wave - packets , it is said to have a _ single - photon resolution_.    real detectors have a variety of characteristics .",
    "most common detectors do not have single - photon resolution , although they can distinguish between a few and many photons .",
    "when small photon numbers are detected , however , these are single - photon sensitivity detectors to a good approximation .",
    "there are also single - photon resolution detectors @xcite .",
    "currently , these detectors require demanding operating conditions . at this point",
    "we note that here , we only consider the detection of single modes . in practice , however , detectors are multi - mode detectors .",
    "since we are dealing with direct detection , these other modes only contribute to the background noise , with the quantum efficiency to the single mode being the key parameter .",
    "when we need single - photon resolution but do not have the resources to employ single - photon resolution detectors , we can use a so - called _ detector cascade _ @xcite . in a detector cascade an incoming mode ( populated by a number of photons )",
    "is split into @xmath56 output modes with equal amplitude which are all detected with single - photon sensitivity detectors .",
    "the idea is to choose the number of output modes large enough , so that the probability that two photons enter the same detector becomes small . in general , an optical setup which transforms @xmath56 incoming modes into @xmath56 outgoing modes is called an @xmath56-port ( see fig .  [ fig:4.1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "a detector cascade is a symmetric @xmath56-port with detectors at the outgoing modes and vacuum states in all input modes except the first mode . in the next section",
    "we will study the statistics of symmetric @xmath56-ports , but first we need to elaborate on the types of errors which occur in detectors .",
    "there are two sources of errors for a detector : it might fail to detect a photon , or it might give a signal although there was nt actually a photon present .",
    "the former may be characterised as a ` detector loss ' and the latter as a ` dark count ' . here",
    ", the emphasis will be on detector losses . in some experiments ( like the innsbruck teleportation experiment @xcite ) the detectors operate within short gated time intervals .",
    "this greatly reduces the effect of dark counts and we will not consider them here .",
    "detector losses are not so easily dismissed .",
    "every photon entering a detector has a certain probability of triggering it .",
    "this probability is called the _",
    "efficiency _ of the detector .",
    "for the purposes of brevity , when a detector is perfectly efficient , we will call it a _ unit - efficiency _ detector . when it has some lower efficiency , we speak of a _ finite - efficiency _ detector . here , we study detector cascading with unit - efficiency detectors , as well as cascading with finite - efficiency detectors @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the case where cascading distinguishes between photon - number states @xmath57 and @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "in this section we treat the properties of detector cascades , or symmetric @xmath56-ports with single - photon sensitivity detectors in the outgoing modes .",
    "symmetric @xmath56-ports yield a ( unitary ) transformation @xmath60 of the spatial field modes @xmath25 , with @xmath61 : @xmath62 where the incoming modes of the @xmath56-port are denoted by @xmath63 and the outgoing modes by @xmath64 . here ,",
    "@xmath65 and @xmath66 are the respective creation and annihilation operators of mode @xmath63 . similarly for mode @xmath67 .",

    "et al_.   have studied such devices in the context of tomography and homodyne detection @xcite .    here , we study @xmath56-ports in the context of optical state preparation , where only one copy of a state is given , instead of an ensemble .",
    "we will use the concept of the _ confidence _ , introduced in section [ confidence ] .",
    "suppose we have a detector cascade , consisting of a symmetric @xmath56-port with single - photon sensitivity detectors in the outgoing modes . according to eqs .",
    "( [ trans1 ] ) and ( [ trans2 ] ) incoming photons will be redistributed over the outgoing modes . in this section",
    "we study the photon statistics of this device .",
    "in particular , we study the case where @xmath69 photons enter a single input mode of the @xmath56-port , with vacuum in all other input modes .",
    "this device ( i.e. , the detector cascade ) will act as a sub - ideal single - photon resolution detector since there is a probability that some of the photons end up in the same outgoing mode , thus triggering the same detector .    to quantify the single - photon resolution of the cascade we use the confidence given by eq .",
    "( [ conf1 ] ) .",
    "suppose we have two spatially separated entangled modes of the electro - magnetic field @xmath8 and @xmath9 with number states @xmath70 in @xmath8 and some other orthogonal states @xmath71 in @xmath9 : @xmath72 where the second mode is used only to give the confidence an operational meaning .",
    "the povm governing the detection can be written as @xmath73 , since we assume that the photons are not lost in the @xmath56-port . in this expression @xmath74",

    "( [ trans1 ] ) and ( [ trans2 ] ) .",
    "we therefore concentrate on @xmath60 rather than @xmath79 .",
    "since there is a one - to - one correspondence between the @xmath56-port ( @xmath60 ) and the matrix @xmath89 , knowledge of @xmath60 is sufficient to calculate the confidence of a given event using the @xmath56-port .",

    "detector cascading thus turns a collection of single - photon sensitivity detectors into a device with _ some _ single - photon resolution . in the next section",
    "we will give a quantitative estimation of this resolution .",
    "let s return again to the schematic state preparation process depicted in figure [ fig:4.0 ] .",
    "there we had two modes , one of which was detected , giving the prepared outgoing state in the other .",
    "we argued that different detection devices yield different output states , and the comparison of these states with the ideal case ( where we used an ideal detector ) led to the introduction of the confidence of a state preparation process .",
    "here , we will use the confidence to make a comparison of different _ detection devices _ , rather than output states .",
    "this can be done by choosing a fixed entangled input state .",
    "the confidence then quantifies the performance of these detection devices .",
    "consider the state preparation process in the setting of quantum optics .",
    "we have two spatial modes of the electro - magnetic field , one of which is detected . in this paper",
    "we are mostly interested in states containing a few photons , and the detection devices we consider therefore include single - photon sensitivity detectors , single - photon resolution detectors and detector cascades . as an example",
    ", we set the task of distinguishing between one and two photons . since",

    "it leads to the choice @xmath140 in eq .",

    "suppose the outgoing state conditioned on a ` one - photon ' indication in the detection device is @xmath1 .",

    "first , consider the single - photon resolution detector described in refs .   @xcite .",
    "this detector can distinguish between one and two photons very well , but it does suffer from detector losses ( the efficiency was determined at 88% ) .",
    "that means that a two - photon state can be identified as a single - photon state when one photon is lost .",
    "the confidence of this detector is therefore not perfect .    in order to model the finite efficiency of the single - photon resolution detector",

    "now we consider a detector cascade with single - photon sensitivity detectors . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4.3 ] the confidence of a single - photon detection with @xmath56-port cascades is depicted .",
    "when the cascade consists of four detectors ( @xmath147 ) it can be easily calculated from eq .",
    "( [ 2con2 ] ) that the detectors need an efficiency of 0.84 to achieve a 0.65 confidence . in the case of infinite cascading ( @xmath148 ) the single - photon confidence of 0.65",
    "is met only if the efficiency is roughly 0.73 .",
    "this puts a severe practical limit on the efficiency of the single - photon sensitivity detectors in the cascade .",
    "detector cascading would be practically useful if a reasonably small number of finite - efficiency detectors yields a high confidence .",
    "in particular when cascading is viewed as an economical alternative to a detector with single - photon resolution the number of detectors in the cascade should be small . additionally , cascading should yield a confidence similar to single - photon resolution detectors .",
    "unfortunately , as a practical application , detector cascading only appears to yield a modest boost in resolution , unless the detectors with single - photon sensitivity have a very high efficiency . in the context of entanglement - based state preparation , real single - photon resolution detectors are therefore superior to detector cascading with currently available detectors , notwithstanding the demanding operating conditions .",
    "in this paper we have studied the use of detection devices in entanglement - based travelling - wave state preparation .",
    "in particular we considered optical devices such as single - photon sensitivity detectors , single - photon resolution detectors and detector cascades .",
    "detector cascading has generally been regarded as a good way to enhance single - photon resolution and consequently the fidelity of a state preparation process @xcite .",
    "however , an extensive theory for the use of these detection devices has not been available so far .",
    "the statistics of @xmath56-ports have been considered in the context of tomography @xcite , which relies on the availability of a large number of copies of a quantum state . in state preparation , however , we perform measurements on single systems , and we therefore need precise bounds on the distinguishability of these measurements .    to this end , we introduced the confidence of preparation , which can also be used to quantify the ( preparation ) performance of a ( realistic ) detection device .",
    "we gave an expression for the confidence of a cascade of arbitrary size @xmath56 , conditioned on an input state of up to two photons .",
    "we believe that this will be sufficient for most practical purposes .",
    "thus , we compared a single - photon resolution detector with a cascade of single - photon sensitivity detectors and found that cascading _ does not give a practical advantage _ over detectors with single - photon resolution for entanglement - based state preparation .",

    "<S> we study the use of detection devices in entanglement - based state preparation . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we consider optical detection devices such as single - photon sensitivity detectors , single - photon resolution detectors and detector cascades ( with an emphasis on the performance of realistic detectors ) . </S>",
    "<S> we develop an extensive theory for the use of these devices . in entanglement - based state preparation </S>",
    "<S> we perform measurements on subsystems , and we therefore need precise bounds on the distinguishability of these measurements ( this is fundamentally different from , e.g. , tomography , where an ensemble of identical states is used to determine probability distributions , etc . ) . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce the confidence of preparation , which may also be used to quantify the performance of detection devices in entanglement - based preparation . </S>",
    "<S> we give a general expression for detector cascades of arbitrary size for the detection up to two photons . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , contrary to the general belief , cascading does not give a practical advantage over detectors with single - photon resolution in entanglement - based state preparation .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs number(s ) : 42.50.ar    </S>",
    "<S> 2 the accurate creation of quantum states is important to many applications in , for example , quantum computation and information @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one method of state preparation is to entangle two systems and subsequently perform a so - called _ conditional _ measurement on one subsystem : depending on the measurement outcome the undetected subsystem is ` prepared ' ( collapsed ) into a particular predetermined state ( see also rubin @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> considerable progress has been made using this method in the creation of _ optical _ quantum states @xcite and in the creation of three - photon polarisation entanglement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> optical entanglement sources include , for example , cross - kerr media @xcite or the mixing of states at beam - splitters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the quality of this entanglement - based state preparation strongly depends on the details of the conditional measurement .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we study the effect of _ realistic _ ( photo- ) detectors on the state preparation process . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the concept of the _ confidence _ of preparation in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ confidence ] . </S>",
    "<S> this measure does not only quantify the ` quality ' of the state preparation process , but it also allows us to compare different types of detection devices . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ odd ] we discuss the distinction between single - photon sensitivity and single - photon resolution detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the statistics of detector cascading with single - photon sensitivity detectors is studied in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : nports ] and sec .   </S>",
    "<S> [ compare ] makes a numerical comparison between such detector cascades and single - photon resolution detectors .    </S>",
    "<S> let s consider entanglement - based state preparation @xcite ( not necessarily restricted to quantum optics ) . </S>",
    "<S> we want to prepare a _ single _ ( pure ) state @xmath0 by means of some entanglement - based process , and we want the resulting state @xmath1 to be as ` close ' to @xmath0 as possible . a measure of resemblance between states is given by the fidelity @xmath2 @xcite : @xmath3\\ ; .\\ ] ] the quality of a state preparation process can therefore be measured by the fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath4 , the process gives exactly @xmath0 and when @xmath5 , the prepared state is orthogonal to @xmath0 . in practice , the fidelity will not reach these extreme measures , but will lie between 0 and 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> for example , if we want to prepare a single - photon state @xmath6 we can use the following process : a parametric down - converter creates a state @xmath7 on two spatial modes @xmath8 and @xmath9 : @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the vacuum state and we assume @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> . the higher order terms ( included in @xmath13 ) consist of states with more than one photon . </S>",
    "<S> we now place a photo - detector in mode @xmath8 , which ` clicks ' when it sees one or more photons ( typically , standard detectors can see single photons , but fail to distinguish between one and two photons ) . </S>",
    "<S> conditioned on such a click , mode @xmath9 will be in a state @xmath14 the fidelity of this process is high : @xmath15 , and this is therefore typically a very good single - photon state preparation process ( although the situation changes drastically when multiple down - converters are considered @xcite ) . due to the large vacuum contribution </S>",
    "<S> , however , the probability of the detector giving a ` click ' will be small ( of order @xmath16 ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the detector does not click , that particular trial is dismissed , hence the _ conditional _ character of the detection .    in this example the outcome of the detection is used to either accept or reject a particular run of the state preparation device . however , in general the outcome of the detector can be used to determine a more complicated operation on the remainder of the state preparation process . </S>",
    "<S> this is detection plus _ feed - forward _ , since the outcome is used further on in the process . </S>",
    "<S> an example of this is quantum teleportation , where the outcome of the bell measurement determines the unitary transformation needed to retrieve the original input state .    </S>",
    "<S> when the measurements in the state preparation process are prone to errors , the state we want to create may not be the state we actually create . </S>",
    "<S> this means that errors in the detection devices can lead to reduced fidelities . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we study the effect of detection errors on optical travelling - wave state preparation . </S>"
