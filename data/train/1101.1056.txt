    "the present theoretical work focuses on the mechanism of this electrochemical reaction in aqueous media .",
    "as discussed in the preceeding paper in this series@xcite ( henceforth `` paper i '' ) which examines the structures , energetics , and charge states of reaction intermediates in detail , the reaction likely takes place in the following logical sequence of steps : @xmath4 `` cop '' will henceforth denote cobalt porphine , the simplest porphyrin species , adopted in this work for ease of calculations.@xcite key questions to be addressed include : ( 1 ) why the reaction , which involves protonation to form carboxylate acid motifs ( cooh ) with p@xmath5 typically on the order of 4.5 , readily proceeds despite the fact that ph@xmath6 in experiments ; ( 2 ) whether all steps are thermodynamically downhill ; ( 3 ) whether the free energy barriers of the intermediate steps are low enough to be consistent with the observed reaction rate ; and ( 4 ) at what stages the two electrons are added .    in eqs .  [ eq1]-[eq4 ] above , we have intentionally left out the charge states of the intermediates as yet unassigned in experiments . since the two electrons can be added at any step(s ) ,",
    "numerous mechanisms are consistent with these equations .",
    "the sequence of electron injection is governed by the redox potentials ( @xmath7 ) of the pertinent reaction intermediates relative to the applied voltage .",
    "the half - cell potentials of various charge states of cobalt porphyrins are known,@xcite but not those for the co- and co@xmath0- bound complexes .    in this work",
    ", we use a combination of _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( aimd)@xcite techniques and density functional theory ( dft ) calculations with various exchange - correlation functionals and the polarizable continuum model@xcite ( hereafter referred to as `` dft+pcm '' ) to study eqs .",
    "[ eq1]-[eq4 ] .",
    "these methods inform and support each other .",
    "the more economical dft+pcm calculations approximate the aqueous environment as a dielectric continuum,@xcite allowing a global overview of the entire electrochemical reaction and a survey of the numerous reaction intermediates .",
    "thus , dft+pcm results reported in paper  i are used to extract @xmath7 for all possible intermediates .",
    "redox potentials consist of hydration free energy ( @xmath8 ) and ionization potential / electron affinity contributions .",
    "while @xmath7 and @xmath8 have also been calculated with the aimd method and explicit treatment of the aqueous environment,@xcite these have so far been limited to monoatomic ions and molecules much smaller than porphyrins comprising a minimum of 37 atoms.@xcite our b3lyp dft+pcm redox potentials predict that copcooh@xmath9 is the key intermediate . to corroborate this @xmath7 conclusion , we also conduct more costly aimd simulations with explicit water molecules .",
    "the hydration structures of the reaction intermediates predicted therein help explain the redox potential trends .",
    "next , we perform aimd calculations on the individual reactions identified as the key steps in dft+pcm calculations .",
    "although it is possible that the electron addition steps of the two - electron reduction of co@xmath0 are rate - limiting,@xcite modeling the electron transfer rate via marcus theory approach@xcite may not answer the most interesting scientific questions .",
    "this is because the electron injection rate almost certainly depends on engineering aspects such as the electrical contact between the gas diffusion electrode and the polymerized catalyst . besides",
    ", it is necessary to demonstrate the viability of other steps in which electron transfer is not involved .",

    "[ eq3 ] ) prior to releasing co ( eq .  [ eq4 ] ) , there is as yet no experimental reaction rate for direct comparison .",
    "the turnover rate per catalytic active site is obscured by the undetermined proportion of active cop molecules actually participating in the reactions .",
    "but our pmf with an approximate reaction coordinate yields a barrier which suggests that co gas evolution should proceed readily if electron transfer from the electrode is fast .",
    "it is known experimentally that co(ii)p binds weakly to co;@xcite our gas phase calculations also shows that the co(i)p - co complex is weakly bound .",
    "therefore once the c - oh bond is severed to form a oh@xmath9 , the subsequent steps ( eq .  [ eq4 ] ) should be exothermic , fast , and non - rate - determining , and they do not require further theoretical studies .",
    "this work provides fundamental understanding specific to the co@xmath0 reduction mechanism in water using macromolecule catalysts , highlights the critical role played by the protic solvent water in lowering the voltage needed for the reaction , and may shed light on ways to further improve and modify the cobalt porphyrin catalyst .",

    "[ eq2 ] ) is accompanied with a change in the co ion charge state , which can be considered a form of coupled proton / electron process.@xcite we show that this can induce hysteresis in aimd simulations .",
    "finally , this study in explicit water , comprising aimd trajectories exceeding 200  ps in duration , is greatly facilitated by the use of an empirical dft+u method@xcite that can treat the localized @xmath2-orbitals of the co ion accurately without resorting to more costly theoretical methods such as hybrid functionals .",
