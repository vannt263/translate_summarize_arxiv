    "a common opening sentence in papers related to the high-@xmath5 cuprates is , `` after fifteen years of its discovery , the mechanism of superconductivity in the high-@xmath5 cuprates is still under debate ... '' .",
    "meanwhile , an intimately related question , the symmetry of the superconductivity order also still possess some ambiguity , and nailing down the gap symmetry can lay a tread for attempts to unveil the superconducting ( sc ) mechanism .",
    "today s situation is that , in the hole - doped ( @xmath6-doped ) compounds , tetragonally symmetric @xmath7-wave superconductivity ( @xmath4sc ) is obtained unanimously in the underdoped and optimally - doped compounds @xcite . in the overdoped compounds ,",
    "diverged results like fully gapped @xmath4+@xmath8 , @xmath4+@xmath9 @xcite or orthorhombic @xmath7+@xmath10 @xcite may be obtained by different probes .",
    "for the electron - doped ( @xmath11-doped ) compounds , observations are more converged @xcite . a nodal sc gap , most probably @xmath7 @xcite , is observed at underdoped . upon electron - doping ,",
    "a nodeless gap is developed as seen in the magnetic penetration depth ( mpd ) measurement @xcite . moreover",
    ", the gap may become nodal again at overdoped @xcite .",
    "the symmetry of the nodeless gap is controversial and various possibilities have been proposed @xcite , such as a conventional @xmath10-wave , or some unconventional symmetry waves like @xmath12+@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "if one admits that the symmetry of the @xmath11-doped compounds could indeed differ from its @xmath6-doped partner and transmutation of gap symmetry does occur , such a situation will be bewildering .",
    "it seems that there are different mechanisms of superconductivity governing the @xmath11-doped and @xmath6-doped cuprates .",
    "moreover , a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) or more qpts may be taking place in the @xmath11-doped cuprates .",
    "we think that the diverging observations of the @xmath6-doped cuprates at the overdoped regime are due to difficulties in the individual experiments , but the more converged result of the @xmath11-doped compounds needs to be seriously look into .    more often the transition between nodal - gap and nodeless - gap behavior in the mpd , on which most conclusions of a gap symmetry transition are based , is ascribed to a qpt of some origin @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we have chosen a more conservative but phenomenological approach .",
    "we take two observational facts as the input .",
    "a caveat beforehand is that those observations are not on the compounds which the mpd data were taken , due to the fact that a particular experimental probe usually does not access different compounds equally well . nevertheless , those observations are on the @xmath11-doped compounds .",
    "the first observation is due to the inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiment , by which a soft - frequency and momentum @xmath14 ( commensurate ) scattering is observed in the nd@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath15 compounds @xcite .",
    "the presence of such a soft excitation in contrast to the @xmath6-doped cuprates is in congruence with the fact that the antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase is more robust in the @xmath11-doped cuprates , and destroyed only at higher doping levels @xcite .",
    "the second observation is due to the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) on the nd compounds .",
    "a pseudogap is seen to open up at the intersections of the af magnetic brillouin zone ( mbz ) boundary and the fermi surface ( fs ) @xcite .",
    "the scattering that is responsible for the pseudogap thus has momentum @xmath16 and is sharp in momentum space . putting the ins and arpes observations together",
    ", we propose that in those @xmath11-doped cuprates where the mpd data were taken , there also exists a soft magnetic fluctuation with momentum @xmath16 and it is coupled to the quasiparticles .",
    "we will study a model system with @xmath4sc co - existing with a _ weak _ af spin - density wave ( sdw ) .",
    "the weak sdw order is used to model an _ incipient _",
    "sdw , or a soft - energy , momentum @xmath17 magnetic fluctuation .",
    "an implicit assumption in this approximation is , all vertex corrections in the current - current correlation function ( which is related to the mpd ) are neglected , and only the self - energy which directly affects the quasiparticle ( qp ) spectrum is considered . as shown by kampf and schrieffer @xcite ,",
    "the change in the single - particle spectrum due to a static sdw was essentially the same as that due to the scattering by a long coherence length , soft magnetic fluctuation ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "thus this modeling should be physically sound for the current problem .",
    "we start from a hamiltonian with @xmath4sc and af sdw order , @xmath18\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\sum_{{\\bf k } \\sigma}\\phi \\sigma c_{{\\bf k}\\sigma}^\\dagger c_{{\\bf k+q}\\sigma } , \\label{eq : h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hopping which is set to 1 , @xmath21 is the next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) hopping used to reproduce a typical bowed fs , @xmath22 , @xmath23 for spin up ( down ) , @xmath24 is the chemical potential , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the sc and sdw order respectively . for a particular band filling , a fixed @xmath24 is used at all temperatures , superconducting and normal states .",

    "some further simplification can be made and eventually this integral is evaluated numerically . the main contribution to",
    "the integral comes from the large @xmath71 / [ \\omega-\\omega ' ] $ ] , i.e. , near - zero frequency regime , and it is therefore a sum over low - energy thermal excitations . when @xmath72 ( e.g. , when @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) , the quantity @xmath71 / [ \\omega-\\omega ' ] $ ] is defined as the limit @xmath75 .    figure [ fig1 ] shows the low - temperature mpd . the same @xmath67 and @xmath26 are used within the temperature range considered , and this approximation should be valid at least at the very low temperature regime , say below @xmath76 .",
    "at approaching zero temperature , we find linearly decreasing behavior @xmath77 at low and high band fillings , which is essentially due to a nodal @xmath4sc ; and negligible temperature dependence at some intermediate band fillings , which is due to a nodeless excitation gap in the single particle spectrum ( see fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] ) ; and the case of negligible temperature - dependence is ascribable to a nodeless gap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the dos [ i.e. , @xmath84 _ { 11}$ ] at different band fillings .",
    "the full gap @xcite that appears at intermediate band fillings explains the small temperature dependence of @xmath85 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and @xmath86 ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) at low temperatures .",
    "interestingly , a subgap twin - peak structure @xcite is seen in the case of the mbz boundary cuts the fs but the gap remain nodal - like ( the case of @xmath87 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . some `` peak - dip - hump '' structure may also appear ( e.g. , see the negative energy side of the @xmath88 case in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the formation of the full gap when the fs is close to the mbz boundary is illucidated in fig .  [ fig4 ] . figure  [ fig4 ] shows the single - particle spectrum @xmath89_{11}$ ] along the diagonal-@xmath62 directions , where a plain @xmath7-wave sc system would have its gapless single - particle excitations . at the presence of a sdw",
    ", the diagonal-@xmath62 qp peaks do not disperse to the fermi level when the fs ( defined at the absence of sdw ) gets close to the mbz boundary [ fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) . see also fig .",
    "[ fig0](c ) ] , and this explains the full gaps in fig .",
    "scattering by the sdw has opened up a gap at the vicinity of the mbz boundary .",
    "interestingly , since the arpes can observe only the negative energy part of the single - particle spectrum , the qps at the sc nodes that are gapped by a sdw [ see fig .  [ fig4](b ) ] may be seen to disperse like qps that are gapped by a sc gap . moreover , though the dos may not vanish on the fermi level , a forbidened window in @xmath90-space at below the fermi level may still be found for the diagonal-@xmath62 qps [ see figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4](c ) ] .",
    "we have used the same @xmath28 , @xmath5 , and @xmath26 throughout our discussion for simplicity . taking into account the differences of those parameters in various cases",
    "should make no qualitative difference in our conclusions as we are essentially discussing thermally activated behaviors due to a full gap , or scale - less behaviors due to a nodal - like gap .",
    "as long as @xmath26 is finite , there exists a range of doping ( within the realistic doping regime ) that can give rise to a full gap .",
    "furthermore , we also believe that our conclusion will remain qualitatively the same when the vertex correction is taken into account , since the gap at the mbz boundary will always be opened up due to the mixing of qps at @xmath62 and @xmath91 .",
    "as the would - be - gapless points on the fs get close to the mbz boundary , they are pushed to higher energies and a full gap in the total dos is formed .",
    "we have adopted a phenomenological approach rather than obtaining the sdw order from a self - consistent mean - field - theory ( mft ) .",
    "this is because naive mfts are usually insufficient to describe the very weak ( probably incipient ) but persisting sdw indicated by the experiments .",
    "in such a situation , the location of the fs but not the size of the sdw , is the dominant factor in determining the low - energy excitations in the @xmath4sc state .",
    "note that though we have assumed a static sdw , the result is in fact equally applicable to the case of an incipient sdw or a soft af spin fluctuation , as the electrons around the fermi level are  fast \" modes , and any relatively  slow \" spin fluctuations are essentially static .",
    "though the properties of the @xmath4sc state can be drastically modified at some of the band fillings , the normal state properties are expected to remain normally .",
    "for instance , the resistivity will always have a quadratic dependence on temperature because in the normal state there exists no gap in the dos near the fermi level [ fig .",
    "[ fig0](a ) ] . on the impurity scattering effect on the mpd",
    ", the linear temperature dependence of @xmath92 at low temperatures in the clean limit that occurs when the @xmath4-wave nodes on the fs are away from the mbz boundary , is expected to cross over to quadratic in @xmath93 ( in the resonant scattering limit)@xcite , regardless of the existence of the sdw or not .",
    "the reason for the independence of sdw is that in those cases the low - energy nodal qps are essentially unaffected  a fact that can be seen in the single - particle spectral function [ see figs .",
    "[ fig4](a ) and ( c ) ] , and manifested in the linear in @xmath94 dependence of the dos at low energies ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "as the low - temperature mpd is related only to the low - energy excitations of those unaffected qps , a theory including the effect of impurity scattering will be essentially the same as that without sdw , which is already widely available in literature @xcite .    at the overdoped compounds ,",
    "two possible factors might account for the recovering of a nodal gap as seen in ref .  .",
    "the first is , the diagonal portions of the fs have proceeded to the other side of , and leave the mbz boundary ( as studied in the current paper ) .",
    "the second is , the strength of the magnetic fluctuation is weakened .",
    "precise arpes and ins measurement on the compounds may be used to resolve the possibilities .",
    "we have investigated the transmutation between nodal - gap - like and nodeless - gap - like behaviors in some of the electron - doped cuprates . a scenario inspired by experiments on some related compounds is proposed .",
    "we propose that there exists a weak or incipient sdw order in the compounds , and it is coupled to the qps .",
    "this scattering can push the would - be - gapless diagonal qps to higher energies , and a @xmath7-symmetry sc system can behave like it is nodeless .                                                in the sense of the usual mean - field theory , @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the onsite hubbard repulsion and @xmath98 is the @xmath99-component of the spin operator . therefore @xmath31 and @xmath100 implies @xmath101 .",
    "such subgap structure in the dos resembles that of a @xmath7@xmath102@xmath10 gap ( e.g. , see ref .  ) or some sign - changing extended-@xmath10 gap [ e.g. , see g. zhao , phys .",
