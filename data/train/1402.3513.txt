    "when layers of perovskite oxides are epitaxially stacked to form a periodically repeated heterostructure , new intriguing functionalities can emerge in the resulting superlattice  [ ] .",
    "these are further tunable via applied electric fields and thermodynamic conditions , and thus attractive for nanoelectronics and energy applications .",
    "an excellent example is the [ pbtio@xmath0@xmath1/[srtio@xmath0@xmath2 system , where the polarization , tetragonality , piezoelectric response , and ferroelectric transition temperature strongly change with the volume ratio of the parent compounds  [ ] . such a remarkable tunability is usually rationalized in terms of epitaxial strains  [ ] , electrostatic coupling ( see fig .  [",
    "fig1]a )  [ ] , and local interface effects  [ ] .    while perovskite titanates with atio@xmath3 formula ( a = sr , pb , ba or ca ) have traditionally been the most popular choice as the basic building blocks , a much wider range of materials ( e.g. , bifeo@xmath3 ) is currently receiving increasing attention by the community .",
    "the motivation for such an interest is clear : a superlattice configuration provides the unique opportunity of enhancing materials properties via `` strain engineering '' , and a multifunctional compound such as bifeo@xmath3 appears to be a natural candidate in this context .",
    "( for example , strain has been predicted to enhance the magnetoelectric response of bifeo@xmath3 by several orders of magnitude compared to bulk samples  [ ] . ) also , a superlattice geometry can alleviate the leakage issues of pure bifeo@xmath3 films  [ ] . combining a iii ",
    "iii perovskite like bifeo@xmath3 ( or i  v , like knbo@xmath3 ) with a ii ",
    "iv titanate appears , however , problematic from the conceptual point of view .",
    "in fact , the charge - family mismatch inevitably leads to polar ( and hence electrostatically unstable ) interfaces between layers  @xcite .",
    "this is not necessarily a drawback , though : recent research has demonstrated that polar interfaces can be , rather than a nuisance to be avoided , a rich playground to be exploited for exploring exciting new phenomena .",
    "the prototypical example is the laalo@xmath4/srtio@xmath4 system , where a metallic two - dimensional electron gas appears at the heterojunction to avoid a `` polar catastrophe ''  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , first - principles calculations have shown that interfaces in oxide superlattices can remain insulating provided that the layers are thin enough , and produce rather dramatic effects on the respective polarization of the individual components  @xcite .",
    "this means that , in a superlattice , polar discontinuities need not be compensated by electronic or ionic reconstructions ; they can , instead , be used as an additional , powerful materials - design tool to control the behavior of the polar degrees of freedom therein .",
    "such a control may be realized , for instance , by altering the stoichiometry at the interfaces ( see fig .  [",
    "fig1]b ) . to fully explore the potential that this additional degree of freedom ( the interface built - in polarity ) provides , and guide the experimental search for the most promising materials combinations , one clearly needs to establish a general theoretical framework where the `` compositional charge ''  @xcite is adequately taken into account .    ,",

    "the advantage of this procedure is that , for a given choice of a and b , the aforementioned four - dimensional parameter space can be explored very efficiently , as no further _ ab initio _ calculations are needed .",

    "the equilibrium configuration of bfo ( i.e. , the minimum of @xmath43 with @xmath44 ) at this value of @xmath20 is the well - known r - type @xmath45-i phase  @xcite , derived from the bulk ground state via the application of epitaxial compression ; pto ( @xmath46 ) , on the other hand , is in a tetragonal @xmath47 phase with the polarization vector oriented out of plane .",
    "intermediate values of @xmath10 yield a linear combination of the two single - component @xmath48 curves , where the spontaneous @xmath49 at equilibrium gradually moves from the pure pto to the pure bfo value .",
    "unfortunately , the possible equilibrium states that can be attained by solely varying @xmath10 ( at this value of @xmath20 and @xmath7 ) lie far from any physically `` interesting '' region of the phase diagram .",
    "for example , note the kink at @xmath500.3  c / m@xmath51 in the pure bfo case , which corresponds to a first - order transition to an orthorhombic @xmath52 phase ( a close relative of the higher - symmetry @xmath53 phase , occurring at @xmath54 ) .",
    "a huge piezoelectric and dielectric response is expected in bfo in a vicinity of the transition  @xcite , raising the question of whether one could approach this region by playing with @xmath7 , in addition to @xmath10 .",
    "the answer is yes : when oxide superlattices with @xmath55 are considered [ corresponding to `` ideal '' ( bio)@xmath56/tio@xmath57 and ( feo@xmath57)@xmath58/pbo interfaces ] , the stable minimum of the system favors a smaller spontaneous polarization in the bfo layers , approaching the aforementioned ( @xmath59 ) phase boundary in the limit of small @xmath10 .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath60 curve becomes asymmetric ( the interfacial charge breaks inversion symmetry ) , and a secondary , metastable minimum appears .",
    "overall , the resulting phase diagram turns out to be much richer , with new combinations of phases emerging ( e.g. in region ii , where bfo exists in the orthorhombic @xmath52 phase and pto in the tetragonal @xmath47 phase ) , and highly non - trivial changes in the electrical properties occurring as a function of @xmath10 .",

    "we shall first consider the case of charged interfaces with @xmath55 , as this choice allows for a direct comparison with the results of yang _",

    "( their crystal space groups , afd pattern and in - plane / out - of - plane ferroelectric polarization , respectively @xmath64 and @xmath65 , are specified in compact form in the figure . ) in region i both pto and bfo adopt a monoclinic @xmath66 phase characterized by large in - phase afd@xmath67 distortions and non - zero @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "such a monoclinic @xmath66 phase is closely related to the orthorhombic @xmath68 structure which has been recently predicted in pto and bfo at large tensile strains  [ ] . in region ii pto adopts an orthorhombic @xmath69 phase , characterized by vanishing afd distortions and a large in - plane @xmath70 ( we neglect the small out - of - plane @xmath65 ) , while bfo is in its well - known @xmath45-i state . in region",
    "iii , bfo remains @xmath45-i , while pto adopts a @xmath47 phase , both with _ opposite _ out - of - plane polarization with respect to region ii. these structures switch back to a positively oriented @xmath65 in region iv , respectively transforming into a monoclinic @xmath45-ii and a tetragonal @xmath71 phase . the @xmath71 phase is characterized by anti - phase afd@xmath67 distorsions and an out - of - plane @xmath70 , while the @xmath45-ii corresponds to the `` supertetragonal '' t - type phase of bfo  @xcite .",
    "note that , as observed already while discussing fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the net interface charge leads to an asymmetric double - well potential , and consequently to an energy difference ( typically of @xmath72  mev / f.u . or less , see fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) between the two oppositely polarized states . ( only one minimum survives at large tensile strains , where the superlattice is no longer ferroelectric . ) at the phase boundaries such energy difference vanishes ; the obvious kinks in the @xmath25 curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) indicate that the transitions ( at @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75   ) are all of first - order type .",
    "the above results are in remarkable agreement with those of yang _",
    "et al . _",
    "the only apparent discrepancy concerns the ordering of the stable / metastable states in region iii , which anyway involves a very subtle energy difference ( and is therefore sensitive to short - range interface effects , not considered here ) .",
    "obtaining such an accurate description of superlattices where the individual layers are as thin as three perovskite units  @xcite provides a stringent benchmark for our method , and validates it as a reliable modeling tool . from the physical point of view",
    "this comparison suggest that , even in the ultrathin limit , pto / bfo superlattices can be well understood in terms of macroscopic bulk effects , i.e. , short - range interface - specific phenomena appear to play a relatively minor role",
    ".        having gained confidence in our method , we can use it to predict the behavior of a hypothetical superlattice with @xmath41 , corresponding to a centrosymmetric reference structure with fully intermixed pb@xmath76bi@xmath76o interface layers ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) . note the symmetry of the two opposite polarization states , and the common value of the spontaneous electric displacement adopted by bfo and pto .",
    "the resulting phase diagram consists , again , in four regions , with a first - order and two second - order phase transitions occurring at @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79    , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) . in three of these regions ,",
    "the individual layers display structures which are different from those obtained in the @xmath80 case : in region i both pto and bfo stabilize in an orthorhombic @xmath68 phase  [ ] , characterized by a vanishing @xmath65 ; in region ii pto adopts a monoclinic @xmath81 phase with the polarization roughly oriented along ( 111 ) ( @xmath82 ) and no afd , while bfo stabilizes in the already discussed @xmath45-i phase ; finally , in region iv , pto is tetragonal @xmath47 and bfo is monoclinic @xmath45-ii .",
    "these findings quantitatively demonstrates that the interface charge mismatch can have a tremendous impact on the physical properties of oxide superlattices .",
    "our simple and general method allows one to model and quantify accurately these effects , and most importantly to rationalize them in terms of intuitive physical concepts .    in summary",

    "we have showed that the effect of the interface stoichiometry , which we describe via the `` compositional '' interface charge @xmath7 , is quite dramatic , and needs to be properly accounted for in the models .",
