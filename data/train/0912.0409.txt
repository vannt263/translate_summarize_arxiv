    "@xcite have predicted a correction to the conductance using the time - dependent current - density functional theory since the dynamical effects give significant contribution to the electron transport , and demonstrated some key results with specific examples .",

    "a simple parametric approach  @xcite is presented for the calculations and it is motivated by the fact that the _ ab initio _ theories are computationally much more expensive , while the model calculations by using the tight - binding formulation are computationally very cheap and also provide a worth insight to the problem .",

    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are the retarded and advanced green s functions , respectively , of the molecule including the effects of the leads .",
    "now , for the full system i.e. , the molecule and two leads , the green s function is expressed as , @xmath14 where , @xmath15 is the energy of the injecting electron .",
    "evaluation of this green s function needs the inversion of an infinite matrix , which is really a difficult task , since the full system consists of the finite size molecule and the two semi - infinite @xmath2d leads .",
    "however , the full system can be partitioned into sub - matrices corresponding to the individual sub - systems and the green s function for the molecule can be effectively written in the form  @xcite , @xmath16 where , @xmath17 corresponds to the hamiltonian of the benzene molecule . within the non - interacting picture ,",

    "@xmath35 is the equilibrium fermi energy .",
    "usually , the electric field inside the molecule , especially for small molecules , seems to have a minimal effect on the @xmath4-@xmath15 characteristics .",
    "thus it introduces a very little error if we assume that the entire voltage is dropped across the molecule - lead interfaces . on the other hand , for larger molecules and higher bias voltage , the electric field inside the molecule may play a more significant role depending on the size and structure of the molecule  @xcite , though the effect becomes quite small .",

    "we use bttiker formalism , an elegant and simple way to study electron transport through multi - terminal mesoscopic systems . in this formalism",
    "we treat all the leads ( current and voltage leads ) on an equal footing and extend the two - terminal linear response formula to get the conductance between the terminals , indexed by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , in the form  @xcite , @xmath39 where , @xmath40 gives the transmission probability of an electron from the lead-@xmath37 to lead-@xmath38 .",

    "these results are also valid even for some finite ( low ) temperatures , since the broadening of the energy levels of the benzene molecule due to its coupling to the leads becomes much larger than that of the thermal broadening  @xcite . on the other hand , at high temperature limit , all these features completely disappear .",
    "this is due to the fact that the phase coherence length decreases significantly with the rise of temperature where the contribution comes mainly from the scattering on phonons , and therefore , the quantum interference effect vanishes .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we take the unit @xmath47 in our present calculations",
    "to illustrate the results , let us begin our discussion by mentioning the values of the different parameters used for the numerical calculations . in the benzene molecule ,",

    "case ii : @xmath52 .",

    "as illustrative examples , in fig .  [ twocond ]",
    "we present the variation of two - terminal conductance @xmath4 and reflection probability @xmath7 as a function of the injecting electron energy @xmath15 .",
    "the results for the weak - coupling limit are shown in ( a ) and ( b ) , while ( c ) and ( d ) , correspond to the variation for the limit of strong molecular coupling .",
    "the flux @xmath0 is fixed at @xmath48 . in the limit of weak - coupling , conductance exhibits sharp resonant peaks ( fig .",
    "[ twocond](a ) ) for some particular energies , while it vanishes almost for all other energies .",
    "it emphasizes that a fine tuning in the energy scale is necessary to get electron conduction across the molecule . at the resonances , the conductance reaches the value @xmath3 , and",
    "therefore , the transmission probability @xmath6 goes to unity , since the relation @xmath54 is satisfied from the landauer conductance formula ( see eq .",
    "( [ equ1 ] ) with @xmath55 in our present description ) .",
    "all these resonant peaks are associated with the energy eigenvalues of the benzene molecule , and hence , we can predict that the conductance spectrum manifests itself the electronic structure of the molecule . following this conductance spectrum , the variation of the reflection probability ( @xmath7 ) ( fig .",
    "[ twocond](b ) ) can be clearly explained .",
    "it shows sharp dips ( @xmath56 ) for some fixed energies where the conductance gets the value @xmath3 . at these resonant energies",
    "@xmath57 which provides @xmath56 , since for the two - terminal quantum system @xmath7 is related to the transmission probability @xmath6 by the equation @xmath8 . for all other energies",
    "@xmath7 becomes @xmath2 , which reveals that for these cases no electron conduction takes place through the molecule .",
    "the behavior of electron transport becomes quite interesting as long as the molecular coupling is increased . in the strong - coupling limit ,",
    "all the resonant peaks get substantial widths ( fig .  [ twocond](c ) ) compared to the weak - coupling limit .",
    "the contribution to the broadening of the resonant peaks appears from the imaginary parts of the self - energies @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively  @xcite . from the conductance spectrum",
    "it is observed that the electron conduction through the molecular bridge takes place almost for all energies , and therefore , in the strong molecular coupling , fine tuning in the energy scale is not required to get electron conduction across the molecule .",
    "a similar effect of the molecular coupling is also observed in the @xmath7-@xmath15 spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ twocond](d ) ) .",
    "it is noticed that almost for the entire energy range the reflection probability does not reach to unity anymore , which allows electron transmission , and , specifically for the four typical energies , it ( @xmath7 ) drops exactly to zero which indicates ballistic transmission through the molecular wire .      to visualize the effects of magnetic flux @xmath0 on electron transport , in fig .",
    "[ twocondphi ] we display the variation of two - terminal conductance ( reddish yellow line ) and reflection probability ( blue line ) as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the results are computed for the typical energy @xmath58 in the limit of strong molecular coupling .",
    "both the conductance and reflection probability vary periodically with @xmath0 showing @xmath59 ( @xmath60 , in our chosen unit ) flux - quantum periodicity . in the presence of magnetic flux ,",
    "the @xmath4-@xmath15 spectrum gets modified significantly due to the additional phase shift among the electronic waves traversing through different arms of the molecular ring and one can control the electron transmission through the molecular wire in a meaningful way .",
    "most significantly we see that , for the typical flux @xmath61 , the conductance exactly vanishes , and therefore @xmath7 becomes @xmath2 , which reveals zero transmission .",
    "this feature can be implemented as follow .",
    "the probability amplitude of getting an electron from the lead-@xmath2 to lead-@xmath3 across the molecular ring depends on the quantum interference of the electronic waves passing through the upper and lower arms of the ring . for the symmetrically connected molecule ( lengths of the upper and lower arms of the molecular ring are identical to each other ) which is threaded by a magnetic flux",
    "@xmath0 , the probability amplitude of getting an electron across the molecule    becomes exactly zero ( @xmath62 ) for the typical flux , @xmath61 .",
    "this is due to the result of the quantum interference among the two waves in the two arms of the molecular ring , which can be shown through few simple mathematical steps .",
    "thus , quantum interference effect plays a crucial role in the study of electron transport in a molecular bridge system which can be controlled by changing the lead - molecule interface geometry as well as by changing the ab flux @xmath0 passing through the molecule .",
    "all the basic features of electron transfer through the molecule become much more clearly visible by investigating the current - voltage characteristics .",
    "the current @xmath63 is determined by the integration procedure of the transmission function @xmath6 ( see eq .",
    "( [ equ6 ] ) ) , where the function @xmath6 varies exactly similar to the conductance spectra , differ only in magnitude by the factor @xmath3 , since the equation @xmath54 is satisfied from the landauer conductance formula ( eq .  ( [ equ1 ] ) ) . as representative examples , in fig .",
    "[ twocurr ] we display the variation of current with the bias voltage @xmath64 for the benzene molecule considering @xmath65 .",
    "the result for the weak - coupling limit is shown in ( a ) , while for the case of strong - coupling it is presented in ( b ) . in the weak - coupling case ,",
    "the current shows staircase like structure with sharp steps as a function of the applied bias voltage @xmath64 .",
    "this is due to the presence of fine resonant peaks in the conductance spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ twocond](a ) ) , as the current is computed from the integration procedure of the transmission function @xmath6 .",
    "the electrochemical potentials in the leads cross one of the molecular energy levels as we increase the bias voltage , and accordingly , it provides a jump in the current - voltage spectrum .",
    "addition to this , it is also important to note that the non - zero value of the current appears beyond a finite value of @xmath64 , the so - called threshold voltage @xmath66 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath63-@xmath64 characteristics changes significantly in the limit of strong molecular coupling ( fig .",
    "[ twocurr](b ) ) .",
    "the step - like feature almost disappears and the current varies quite continuously with the bias voltage @xmath64 . not only that",
    ", it ( @xmath63 ) also achieves very large current amplitude compared to the weak - coupling case .",
    "this enhanced current amplitude can be noticed clearly by observing the area under the @xmath4-@xmath15 curve presented in fig .",
    "[ twocond](c ) . here",
    "the non - zero value of the current is observed for very small value of the bias voltage @xmath64 i.e. , @xmath67 .",
    "finally , from these @xmath63-@xmath64 spectra ( figs .  [ twocurr](a ) and ( b ) ) it can be manifested that the molecule - to - lead coupling strength has a significant influence in the determination of the current amplitude as well as the threshold bias voltage @xmath66 , which may provide several key features in designing molecular electronic devices .      following the above brief description of electron transport in the two - terminal molecular system ,",
    "now we focus our results in detail for the three - terminal molecular system , and here we will show how such a simple system can be utilized as an electronic transistor .      in the three - terminal molecular system , several anomalous features are observed in the conductance - energy spectra as well as in the variation of reflection probability with the energy @xmath15 .",
    "as representative examples , in fig .  [ threecond ]",
    "we present the results , where the first column gives the variation of conductance @xmath68 and the second column represents the nature of reflection probability @xmath69 .",
    "all these results are computed for @xmath65 . from the conductance",
    "spectra it is observed that the conductances exhibit fine resonant peaks ( red curves ) for some particular energies in the limit of weak - coupling , while they get broadened ( blue curves ) as long as the coupling strength is enhanced to the strong - coupling limit .",
    "the explanation for the broadening of the resonant peaks is exactly similar as described earlier in the case of two - terminal molecular system .",
    "a similar effect of molecular coupling to the side attached leads is also noticed in the variation of reflection probability versus the energy spectra ( right column of fig .",
    "[ threecond ] ) .",
    "since in this three - terminal molecular system the leads are connected asymmetrically to the molecule i.e. , the path length between the leads are different from each other , all the conductance spectra are different in nature .",
    "it is also observed that the heights of the different conductance peaks are not identical and they get reduced significantly compared to the two - terminal case .",
    "this is solely due to the effect of quantum interference among the different arms of the molecular ring .",
    "now , in the variation of reflection probabilities , we also get the complex structure like as the conductance spectra . for this three - terminal system",
    "since the reflection probability is not related to the transmission probability simply as in the case of a two - terminal system , it is not necessarily true that @xmath69 shows picks or dips where @xmath68 has dips or picks .",
    "it depends on the combined effect of @xmath40 s .      in order to describe the dependence of magnetic flux on conductances    and reflection probabilities , in fig .",
    "[ threecondphi ] we plot the results for the three - terminal molecular system in the limit of strong - coupling .",
    "the first column corresponds to the conductance ( @xmath68 ) , while the second column represents the results for the reflection probability ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "all the results are done for the typical energy @xmath58 and they show different complex spectra . the conductances and reflection probabilities vary periodically exhibiting @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) flux - quantum periodicity . from our results we see that , at @xmath61 , the conductances @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) and @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) drop exactly to zero i.e. , @xmath74 . while , @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) gets the value @xmath3 for this typical value of @xmath0 .",
    "this vanishing transmission probability at @xmath61 will not always appear for the other choices of the energy @xmath15 in our asymmetrically connected three - terminal molecular system .",
    "on the other hand , here it is important to note that , for our symmetrically connected two - terminal molecular system the transmission probability always vanishes for the flux @xmath61 , since for this typical value of @xmath0 , a @xmath77 phase shift takes place among the waves traversing through the upper and lower arms of the molecular ring which provides zero transmission amplitude .",

    "( [ equ10 ] ) ) , where the individual contributions from the other two leads have to be taken into account .    to be more precise , we can write the current expression for the three - terminal molecular device where one of the terminals serves as a voltage as well as a current probe  @xcite in the form @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the voltage difference between the lead-@xmath37 and lead-@xmath38 .    in fig",
