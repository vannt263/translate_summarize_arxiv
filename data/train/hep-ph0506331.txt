    "in ultraperipheral relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( upc s ) the ions do not interact directly with each other and move essentially undisturbed along the beam direction .",
    "the only possible interaction is due to the long range electromagnetic interaction and diffractive processes ( for a review see , e. g. refs .",

    "the electromagnetic field is very strong and the resulting flux of equivalent photons is large .",
    "a photon stemming from the electromagnetic field of one of the two colliding nuclei can penetrate into the other nucleus and interact with one or more of its hadrons , giving rise to photon - nucleus collisions to an energy region hitherto unexplored experimentally .",
    "for example , the interaction of quasi - real photons with protons has been studied extensively at the electron - proton collider at hera , with @xmath1 gev . due to the larger number of photons coming from one of the colliding nuclei in heavy ion collisions , a similar and more detailed study will be possible in these collisions , with @xmath2 reaching 950 gev for the large hadron collider ( lhc ) operating in its heavy ion mode .",
    "similarly , one can investigates qcd effects in the context of coherent two - photon scattering at upc s @xcite .",
    "the important advantage of investigating two - photon interactions in nuclear collisions is the flux of virtual photons from the electromagnetic field of the nuclei scaling as @xmath3 , giving a two - photon luminosity scaling as @xmath4 .",

    "for a recent review on heavy quark production in upc s , see ref . @xcite .",
    "in particular , much effort has been devoted to obtain signatures of the qcd pomeron in such processes @xcite , which can be used to constrain the qcd dynamics at high energies . on the other hand ,",
    "recently the star collaboration released the first data on the cross section of the coherent @xmath9 production in gold - gold upc s at @xmath10 gev @xcite , which provides the first opportunity to check the basic features and main approximations of the distinct approaches describing nuclear vector meson photoproduction .    here",
    ", we analyze the possibility of using upc s as a photon - photon / nucleus collider , and study the production of vector mesons considering different qcd dynamics .",

    "in heavy ion collisions the large number of photons coming from one of the colliding nuclei will allow to study photoproduction , with the photonuclear cross sections given by the convolution between the photon flux from one of the nuclei and the cross section for the scattering photon - nuclei . the final expression for the production of vector mesons in upc s",
    "is then given by , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the photon energy ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 is the meson mass and @xmath17 is the ion - ion c.m.s energy . for instance , the lorentz factor for lhc is @xmath18 , giving the maximum c.m.s . @xmath19 energy @xmath20 gev . in this process",
    "we have that the nuclei are not disrupted and the final state consists solely of the two nuclei and the vector meson decay products .",
    "consequently , we have that the final state is characterized by a small number of centrally produced particles , with rapidity gaps separating the central final state from both beams",
    ". moreover , due to the coherence requirement , the transverse momentum is limited to be smaller than @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the nuclear radius .",

    ".    currently , there are in literature different models for the photonuclear vector meson production cross section which differ basically in the treatment for the photon and for its interaction with the target .",
    "the main aspect is that real photons have a complicated nature . in a first approximation ,",
    "the photon is a point - like particle , although in field theory it may fluctuate also into a fermion pair ( see discussions in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case",
    "where there is a photon transition in a colorless antiquark - quark pair , the propagation of this colorless hadronic wave packet in a nuclear medium can be treated either in the hadronic basis as a result of gribov s inelastic corrections or in qcd in terms of the partonic basis , which are complementary .",
    "lets briefly discuss these two representations ( for a detailed discussion see ref .",
    "the time scale characterizing the evolution of a @xmath44 wave packet can be estimated based on the uncertainty principle and lorentz dilation .",
    "the lifetime of the photon fluctuation is given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the photon energy , @xmath16 is the mass of the fluctuation and @xmath47 is the photon virtuality .",
    "it is usually called coherence time . using light - cone kinematics we can define the coherence length , which is given by @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , one can not decide whether a ground state @xmath49 is produced or the next - excited state @xmath50 , unless the process lasts longer than the inverse mass difference between these states . in the rest frame of the nucleus , this formation time is lorentz dilated and is given by @xmath51 .",
    "similarly , we can define a formation length given by @xmath52 .",
    "in the hadronic basis , the same process looks quite different .",
    "the incident photon may produce different states on a bound nucleon , the @xmath49 meson ground state or an excited state .",
    "those states propagate through the nucleus experiencing multiple - diagonal and off - diagonal diffractive interactions , and eventually the ground state is detected . according the quark - hadron duality",
    ", we expect that these two descriptions to be equivalent . however , as these two approaches have been used assuming different approximations , their comparison may provide a scale for the theoretical uncertainty involved .",
    "furthermore , it is important to emphasize that at high photon energy @xmath46 , both @xmath53 and @xmath54 greatly exceed the nuclear radius @xmath22 , which implies in the partonic basis that the transverse size of the @xmath55 pair do not change during the interaction with the target .",
    "this enables one to introduce the qcd dipole picture @xcite , where the process is factorized into the photon fluctuation in a @xmath55 pair and the dipole cross section .",
    "these aspects become the interpretation in the partonic basis more intuitive and straightforward than in the hadronic basis .",
    "let us consider the scattering process @xmath56 in the qcd dipole approach , where @xmath49 stands for both light and heavy mesons .",
    "the scattering process can be seen in the target rest frame as a succession in time of three factorizable subprocesses : i ) the photon fluctuates in a quark - antiquark pair ( the dipole ) , ii ) this color dipole interacts with the target and , iii ) the pair converts into vector meson final state . using as kinematic variables the @xmath57 c.m.s .",

    "@xcite ) . here",
    ", we follows the analytically simple dgkp approach @xcite , which assumes that the dependencies on @xmath68 and @xmath69 of the wavefunction are factorised , with a gaussian dependence on @xmath68 ( for a detailed discussion see refs .",
    "the main shortcoming of this approach is that it breaks the rotational invariance between transverse and longitudinally polarized vector mesons @xcite .",
    "however , as it describes reasonably the hera data for vector meson production , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will use it in our phenomenological analysis .",
    "finally , the imaginary part of the forward amplitude can be obtained by putting the expressions for photon and vector meson ( dgkp ) wavefunctions into eq .",
    "( [ sigmatot ] ) .",
    "moreover , summation over the quark / antiquark helicities and an average over the transverse polarization states of the photon should be taken into account . the transverse component",

    "this correction is about 3% for light mesons and it reaches 13% for @xmath11 at high energies @xcite .",
    "additionally for heavy mesons we have take into account the skewedness effects , associated to off - forward features of the process ( different transverse momenta of the exchanged gluons in the @xmath83-channel ) , which are increasingly important in this case .    in order to obtain the dipole - nucleus cross section we will assume the validity of the glauber - gribov picture @xcite which allows to write @xcite @xmath84 \\ , \\right\\}\\ , , \\label{sigmanuc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the impact parameter of the center of the dipole relative to the center of the nucleus and the integrand gives the total dipole - nucleus cross section for a fixed impact parameter .",
    "the nuclear profile function is labeled by @xmath85 , which will be obtained from a 3-parameter fermi distribution for the nuclear density .",
    "the above equation sums up all the multiple elastic rescattering diagrams of the @xmath44 pair and is justified for large coherence length , where the transverse separation @xmath68 of partons in the multiparton fock state of the photon becomes as good a conserved quantity as the angular momentum , _",
    "i. e. _ the size of the pair @xmath68 becomes eigenvalue of the scattering matrix .",
    "for the dipole - proton cross section we follow the quite successful saturation model @xcite , which interpolates between the small and large dipole configurations , providing color transparency behavior , @xmath86 , as @xmath87 and constant behavior , @xmath88 , at large dipole separations .",
    "the parameters of the model have been obtained from an adjustment to small @xmath89 hera data .",

    "it is noticeable that the energy dependence of the dipole - nucleus cross section [ eq .",
    "( [ sigmanuc ] ) ] is strongly connected with the saturation scale @xmath99 .",
    "namely , the saturation effects are larger whether the momentum scale is of order or larger than the correspondent size of the vector meson and the energy growth of the cross section is then slowed down . in table [ tab1 ] one shows the corresponding integrated cross section . for lhc energy ,",
    "one considers lead ( pb ) and calcium ( ca ) , whereas for rhic one takes gold ( au ) and silicon ( si ) .",

    "@xcite , which considers vdm plus a classical mechanical calculation for nuclear scattering and uses as input for the @xmath100 reaction an extrapolation of the experimental desy - hera fits for meson photoproduction .",

    "iii in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . at rhic energy and si nucleus ,",
    "our results are about 20 % lower for @xmath9 and @xmath14 , whereas gives a larger @xmath101 cross section and almost the same @xmath11 cross section .",
    "however , the situation changes for gold nucleus , where the present results are about 50 % larger than the estimates in ref .",
    "@xcite . at lhc energy and for ca",
    "nucleus , our results gives higher cross section by a factor of order 10 % , whereas for lead nucleus the factor reaches a factor 2 for light mesons and almost similar for the @xmath11 meson . basically , the values are quite similar for light nuclei . for heaviest nuclei ,",
    "the results overestimate those ones in ref .",
    "@xcite when one considers light mesons and become similar for the @xmath11 case .",
    "these features can be understood through the theoretical procedure when considering the nuclear scattering .",
    "now we compare our results @xcite with those ones in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the main focus is on the @xmath9 and @xmath11 production . for @xmath9",
    "the predictions are computed only for rhic energy @xmath102 gev and we will consider it later on .",
    "we can anticipate that their results are closer to ours since a glauber - gribov approach is used in describing the scattering on nuclei .",
    "for @xmath11 the theoretical approach for the photonuclear production was the collinear qcd double logarithmic approximation , where the @xmath103 cross section is directly proportional to the squared nuclear gluon density distribution @xcite .",
    "there , it was considered an impulse approximation ( no nuclear shadowing ) and a leading twist shadowing version .",
    "the impulse approximation gives a larger cross section at central rapidity ( about a factor 4 higher for ca and a factor 6 for pb ) , while at fragmentation region both approximations match each other at lhc energy for ca and pb nuclei .",
    "our results are closer to their impulse approximation , which suggests nuclear shadowing could be weak for @xmath11 production",
    ". this feature can be easily tested in the first experimental measurements of coherent @xmath11 production on upc s at lhc . concerning the integrated cross section",
    ", they found 0.6 mb for ca nucleus and 70 mb for pb at lhc .",
    "our results are 0.44 mb and 41.5 mb , respectively",
    ". thus , our results are about 15 % lower for ca and also 40 % lower for pb .",
    "the difference between the predictions comes from mostly from the distinct qcd approaches considered used and the different photon flux in the upc calculation .",
    "recently , the star collaboration published the first measuremente for coherent @xmath9 production in gold - gold upc s at @xmath10 gev @xcite , providing the first opportunity to test the distinct approaches describing nuclear vector meson photoproduction .",

    "considering an integrated luminosity of @xmath167 pb@xmath168 in three years and @xmath169 gev , almost 70 events are expected taking into account the non - leading corrections to the bfkl approach @xcite .",
    "therefore , we predict a large number of events in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions , allowing future experimental analyses , even if the acceptance for the @xmath11 detection being low . it should be stressed that the lhc probably will operate in its heavy ion mode only four weeks per year .",
    "let s now discuss the @xmath170 production in upc s @xcite .",
    "at the photon level , this process can be calculated similarly as made for the elastic @xmath11 photoproduction off the proton @xcite .",

    "the two - photon cms energy is denoted by @xmath6 , where @xmath173 and @xmath174 is the heavy meson mass .",
    "the mass scale is given by @xmath175 .",
    "in the small-@xmath83 approximation , the slope is estimated to be @xmath176 gev@xmath177 @xcite .",
    "the light meson - photon coupling is denoted by @xmath178 and the heavy meson decay width into a lepton pair is @xmath179 .",
    "moreover , @xmath180 is the gluon content of the light meson , which can be contraint from experimental data for the cross section",
    ". currently , there are different parameterizations for this distribution in the literature , associated to distinct qcd dynamics . in ref .",
    "@xcite we investigate if an experimental analysis of the @xmath181 allows discriminate among distinct parameterizations for the gluon content of the light meson . in particular , we use both lo and nlo grs parameterization @xcite , the sas1d parameterization @xcite and a phenomenological regge motivated ansatz @xcite .",
    "the latter is given by @xmath182 , with @xmath183 and the pomeron intercept is considered as @xmath184 , in agreement with the effective power in the hera data .",
    "for the nuclear case we allow for a higher intercept , in order to simulate a bfkl - like behavior , motivated by the studies in double @xmath11 production @xcite .",
    "the normalization , @xmath185 , is given by the nlo - grs parameterization .",
    "the differences among the parameterizations are sizeable already at photon level as a consequence of distinct effective exponent @xmath186 .",
    "the grs lo one presents the steeper behavior , followed by sas1d ( @xmath187 ) .",
    "the regge motivated and grs nlo parameterizations are more close since the intercept for the regge ansatz is similar to the effective power of grs nlo ( @xmath188 ) . the results for the @xmath181 production cross sections at the photon level can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for @xmath181 meson production in upc s at lhc energy range",
    "we have that an upper bound is obtained using the sas1d parameterization and the lower one by the regge ansatz with the lower pomeron intercept @xmath184 . at the lhc energies @xmath189 gev",
    ", the cross section takes values between 680 nb and 2.6 mb , showing the process can be used to discriminate among parameterizations .",
    "it should be noted that the ultraperipheral cross section is dominated by not so high two - photons energies .",
    "although the deviations among the models are quite visible at very high energies , in the nuclear cross section such deviations are less sizeable .",
    "this is directly related to the effective two - photon luminosity , which peaks at smaller @xmath190 .",
    "therefore , correct estimates should include careful treatment of the low energy threshold effects .",
    "the nuclear cross section is enhanced in relation to the @xmath191 case , which provides values of hundreds of pb s in contrast with units of mb in the peripheral nuclear case .",
    "comparing our estimates with the felix parameterization @xcite , it was found the values predicted by felix collaboration are ever larger than obtained using the approach presented here , independently of the value of slope used . as a cross check",
    ", we also calculated the cross section for @xmath170 production in upc s using the same kinematical cut proposed in ref .",
    "in such a situation , the agreement was much better .",
    "as a byproduct , using the pomeron - exchange factorization theorem @xcite we can use the results for double @xmath11 production and for @xmath192 production to obtain a rough estimate of the double @xmath9 production in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions . in principle , this theorem can not be applied for bfkl pomeron , since it is not an isolated regge pole . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , only when the asymptotic freedom is incorporated into the bfkl equation is that the bfkl pomeron can be expressed in terms of a series of isolated poles in the angular - momentum plane , with the contribution of each isolated pole satisfying the factorization theorem .",
    "an open question is how much the factorization is violated in different processes . in what follows we estimate the double @xmath9 cross section assuming the pomeron - exchange factorization theorem .",
    "these predictions should be compared with those obtained in a qcd calculation .",
    "preliminary results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite shown that the violation is not large .",

    "we present our predictions for the double @xmath9 production in ultraperipheral @xmath31 collisions , considering different scenarios for the qcd dynamics .",
    "we can see that there is a large range of possible values for the cross section , which implies that future experimental data are essential to constraint the dynamics as well as the violations of the factorization theorem .",

    "before presenting a summary of the main results , lets discuss the background processes and experimental separation . in ref .",
    "@xcite a detailed analysis of the experimental separation between photoproduction and two - photon interactions was presented . there",
    ", the authors have estimated that the two - photon cross sections are at least 1000 smaller than the photoproduction cross section , which makes the experimental separation between the two interactions very hard .",
    "our calculations indicate that the inclusion of the qcd pomeron effects implies higher cross sections at two - photon level and , consequently , larger cross sections in ultraperipheral collisions .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of these effects implies that , in general , the contribution of two - photon interactions is non - negligible .",
    "however , the experimental separation of two - photon process still remains a challenge . in principle , an analysis of the impact parameter dependence should allow to separate between the two classes of reactions , since two - photon interactions can occur at a significant distance from both nuclei , while a photonuclear interaction must occur inside or very near a nucleus .",
    "other possible background process is that associated to pomeron - pomeron interactions .",
    "it has been verified that such reactions would be non - negligible for light ions , while they are significantly suppressed for heavy ions @xcite . in the particular case of the double heavy meson production",
    "this contribution deserves more detailed studies , since the current treatments rely on the regge formalism instead of a qcd approach .",
    "an additional contribution in two photon ultraperipheral collisions is the meson production accompanied by mutual coulomb dissociation .",
    "it has been estimated that these reactions increase the total cross section for an amount of @xmath195 at rhic / lhc energies @xcite .",
    "we disregarded this contribution in the present calculations , since that it would be smaller than the associated theoretical uncertainties .",
    "let s consider the experimental feasibility of photonuclear production .",
    "although the vector meson photoproduction at @xmath31 collisions to be a small fraction in comparison to the total hadronic cross sections , the experimental separation of these reaction channels is possible . as",
    "photoproduction is an exclusive reaction , @xmath196 , the separation of the signal from hadronic background would be relatively clear .",
    "namely , the characteristic features in photoproduction at upc s are low @xmath23 meson spectra and a double rapidity gap pattern .",
    "moreover , the detection ( roman pots ) of the scattered nuclei can be an additional useful feature . in hadroproduction ,",
    "the spectra on transverse momentum of mesons are often peaked around meson mass , @xmath197 .",
    "an experimental cut @xmath198 gev would eliminate most part of the hadronic background .",
    "hence , the rapidity cut would enter as an auxiliary separation mechanism .",
    "this procedure is specially powerful , since there will be rapidity gaps on both sides of the produced meson .    as a summary ,",
    "the cross sections for the @xmath196 ( @xmath199 ) process were computed and theoretical estimates for scattering on both light and heavy nuclei are given for rhic and lhc energies .",
    "the rates are very high , mostly for light mesons and at lhc energies . as an important result",
    ", we compare our prediction for the coherent @xmath9 meson production with rhic data at @xmath102 gev .",
    "the corresponding results are in good agreement with the experimental results when considered the cuts on momentum transfer and on rapidity .",
    "moreover , we have computed the double vector production in upc where one considers the perturbative qcd pomeron , described by the bfkl equation . for the mixed light - heavy meson production ,",
    "we use the ddla pqcd approximation , which depends on the gluon content of the light meson and obtain the double @xmath9 cross section using the previous results through the pomeron - exchange factorization theorem .    as a final remark , in a similar way",
    "the strong electromagnetic fields generated by high - energy protons allow us to study photon - nucleon processes in proton - proton interactions in a large kinematical range .",
    "these events can be experimentally studied by selecting events with low multiplicity and small total transverse momentum .",
    "we have studied this case for the photoproduction of vetor mesons in proton-(anti)proton in ref . @xcite and the photoproduction of heavy quarks in ref .",
