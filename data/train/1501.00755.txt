    "a number of candidates for a weyl semimetal have been previously proposed . however , existing proposals have proven difficult to carry out because they rely on magnetic ordering to break time - reversal symmetry or fine - tuning the chemical composition of an alloy .",
    "magnetic order can be difficult to predict from first - principles , may be difficult to measure experimentally , and most importantly , may not form large enough domains in a real sample for the properties of the weyl semimetal to be preserved . fine - tuning chemical composition is typically challenging to achieve and introduces disorder , limiting the quality of single crystals .",
    "for instance , a proposal for a weyl semimetal in y@xmath1ir@xmath1o@xmath25 @xcite assumes an all - in , all - out magnetic order , which is challenging to verify in experiment @xcite .",
    "another proposed weyl semimetal , hgcr@xmath1se@xmath26 @xcite , has a clear ferromagnetic order , but because of the cubic structure there is no preferred magnetization axis , likely leading to the formation of many small ferromagnetic domains .",
    "moreover , a proposal in hg@xmath27cd@xmath28mn@xmath29te @xcite requires straining the sample to break cubic symmetry , applying an external magnetic field and fine - tuning the chemical composition .",
    "another proposal for the inversion breaking compounds labi@xmath30sb@xmath28te@xmath0 and labi@xmath30sb@xmath28te@xmath0 @xcite requires fine - tuning the chemical composition to within 5% . despite extensive experimental effort , a weyl semimetal has not been realized in any of these compounds .",
    "we believe that in large part the difficulty stems from relying on magnetic order to break time - reversal symmetry and fine - tuning the chemical composition to achieve the desired band structure .",
    "we note that , in contrast to time - reversal symmetry breaking systems , large single crystals of inversion symmetry breaking compounds exist , such as the large bulk rashba material bitei , where the crystal domains are sufficiently large so that the rashba band structure is clearly observed in photoemission spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "we propose that taas overcomes the difficulties of previous candidates because it realizes a weyl semimetal in a stoichiometric , inversion - breaking , single - crystal material .",
    "we have also studied other members of this class of compounds , tap , nbas and nbp .",
    "they have the same crystal structure as taas .",
    "our results show that their band structure is qualitatively the same as that of taas , in that the conduction and valence bands form line nodes in the absence of spin - orbit coupling and a gap is opened in the presence of spin - orbit coupling , leading to a weyl semimetal . in particular , since nb and p have quite weak spin - orbit coupling , our calculations suggest that nbp is better described as a topological nodal - line semimetal .",
    "thus nbp might offer the possibility to realize novel nodal line band crossings in the bulk and `` drumhead '' surface states stretching across the nodal line on the surface @xcite .",
    "next , we provide some general comments on the nature of the phase transition between a trivial insulator , a weyl semimetal and a topological insulator , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4]*a*. when a system with inversion symmetry undergoes a topological phase transition between a trivial insulator and a topological insulator , the band gap necessarily closes at a kramers point .",
    "if we imagine moving the system through the phase transition by tuning a parameter @xmath31 , then there will be a critical point where the system is gapless . in a system which breaks inversion symmetry",
    ", there will instead be a finite range of @xmath31 where the system remains gapless , giving rise to a weyl semimetal phase . in this way",
    ", the weyl semimetal phase can be viewed as an intermediate phase between a trivial insulator and a topological insulator , where the bulk band gap of a trivial insulator closes and weyl points of opposite chiral charge nucleate from the bulk band touchings . as @xmath31",
    "is varied , the weyl points thread surface states through the surface bz and eventually annihilate each other , allowing the bulk band gap to reopen with a complete set of surface states , giving rise to a topological insulator .",
    "this understanding of a weyl semimetal as an intermediate phase between a trivial insulator and a topological insulator offers some insight into the closed fermi surfaces we find in taas around the @xmath32 point of the top surface and the @xmath33 point of the bottom surface .",
    "we propose that these surface states reflect the topological invariant we would find if we annihilated the weyl points to produce a bulk insulator .",
    "we consider the bottom surface , and annihilate the weyl points in pairs in the obvious way to remove all surface states along @xmath21 .",
    "then , we can annihilate the remaining weyl points to produce two concentric fermi surfaces around the @xmath33 point . since this is an even number of surface states , we find that this way of annihilating the weyl points gives rise to a trivial insulator . if , instead , we annihilate the remaining weyl points to remove the fermi arc connecting them , only the closed fermi surface would be left around @xmath33 , giving rise to a topological insulator .",
    "a similar analysis applies to the top surface .    finally , we highlight an interesting phenomenon regarding how an electron travels along a constant energy contour in our predicted weyl semimetal , taas . fig .",
    "[ fig4]*b * shows the calculated fermi surface contours on both the top and the bottom surfaces near the @xmath24 point .",
    "we consider an electron initially occupying a state in one of the red fermi arcs , whose wavefunction is therefore localized on the top surface in real space .",
    "we ask how the wavefunction evolves as the electron traces out the constant energy contour . as the electron moves along the fermi arc ( the red arc on the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig4]*c * ) , it will eventually reach a weyl point , where its wavefunction will unravel into the bulk .",
    "the electron will then move in real space to the bottom surface of the sample .",
    "then it will follow a fermi arc on that surface ( the blue arc on the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig4]*b * ) , and reach another weyl point .",
    "the electron will next travel through the bulk again and reach the top surface , returning to the same fermi arc where it began .",
    "this novel trajectory is predicted to show exotic surface transport behavior as proposed in ref .",
    "this is one example of the unique transport phenomena predicted in weyl semimetals . to study these effects both from fundamental interest and for novel devices",
    ", here we provides a promising candidate for a weyl semimetal in a stoichiometric , inversion - breaking , single - crystal material , as represented by taas .",
    "we hope that our theoretical prediction will soon lead to the experimental discovery of the first weyl semimetal in nature .",

    "<S> we also observe pairs of weyl points with the same chiral charge which project onto the same point in the surface brillouin zone , giving rise to multiple fermi arcs connecting to a given weyl point . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that taas is the first topological semimetal identified which does not depend on fine - tuning of chemical composition or magnetic order , greatly facilitating an exploration of weyl physics in real materials . </S>",
    "<S> ( note added : this theoretical prediction of november 2014 ( see paper in nature communications at http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150612/ncomms8373/full/ncomms8373.html ) was the basis for the first experimental discovery of weyl fermions and topological fermi arcs in taas recently published in science ( 2015 ) at http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2015/07/15/science.aaa9297.abstract )    the rich correspondence between high energy and condensed matter physics has led to a deeper understanding of spontaneous symmetry breaking , phase transitions , renormalization and many other fundamental phenomena in nature , with important consequences for practical applications using magnets , superconductors and other novel materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , there has been considerable progress in realizing particles previously considered in high energy physics as emergent quasiparticle excitations of crystalline solids , such as majorana fermions and dirac fermions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> materials that host these exotic particles exhibit unique properties and hold promise for applications such as fault - tolerant quantum computation , low - power electronics and spintronics . </S>",

    "<S> this makes the unique properties associated with this electron band structure more robust . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , due to its nontrivial topology , a weyl semimetal can exhibit novel fermi arc surface states . </S>",
    "<S> previously , fermi arcs were only found in high-@xmath2 superconductors due to strong electron correlation effects . </S>",

    "<S> however , we may expect ta @xmath14 electrons to have a broad bandwidth because of the wide extent of the atomic orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to strong hybridization with the as @xmath12 states , which may suggest that the conduction and valence bands are not entirely separated in energy and have a small overlap , giving rise to a semimetal . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]*c * , we present the bulk band structure in the absence of spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the conduction and valence bands cross each other along the @xmath15 trajectory , which further indicates that taas is a semimetal . in the presence of spin - orbit coupling , </S>",
    "<S> the band structure is fully gapped along the high symmetry directions considered in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2]*a*. there are 24 weyl points in total : 8 weyl points on the @xmath18 plane , which we call @xmath19 , and 16 weyl points away from the @xmath18 plane , which we call @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we present the band structure near one of the weyl points @xmath19 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]*c * , where a point band touching is clearly observed . </S>",
    "<S> next , we consider how the weyl points project on the ( 001 ) surface bz . </S>",
    "<S> we show a small region in the surface bz around the @xmath21 line , which includes the projections of six weyl points , two from @xmath19 and four from @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> a schematic of the projections of all 24 weyl points on the surface bz is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]*e*. we find that for all points @xmath20 , two weyl points project on the same point in the surface bz . we indicate the number of weyl points that project on a given point in the surface bz in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]*e*. </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we study the chirality of the weyl points by calculating the berry flux through a closed surface enclosing a weyl point . </S>",
    "<S> we call positive the chiral charges which are a source of berry flux and negative the chiral charges which are a sink of berry flux . </S>",
    "<S> we color the positive chiral charges white and the negative chiral charges black . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]*f * , we show the spin texture of the band structure near two weyl points @xmath19 . in this case , the spin texture is found to be consistent with the texture of the berry curvature . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it turns out that the points @xmath20 project on the surface bz in pairs which carry the same chiral charge .    </S>",
    "<S> another key signature of a weyl semimetal is the presence of fermi arc surface states which connect the weyl points in pairs in the surface bz . we present calculations of the ( 001 ) surface states in fig .  [ fig3 ] . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3]*b*. we find surface fermi arcs that connect weyl points of opposite chirality in pairs . to better understand the rich structure of the fermi arcs , we show a schematic of the surface states on the top surface in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]*c * and the bottom surface in fig .  [ fig3]*d*. note that one fermi arc connects each pair of points @xmath19 . however , two fermi arcs connect to each projection of points @xmath20 , because they project in pairs with the same chiral charge , as discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to fermi arcs which connect the points @xmath20 in a closed loop of surface states . </S>",
    "<S> the largest fermi arc loop on the top surface threads through four projected weyl points in the surface bz . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the fermi surface of the surface states from the top is very different from that of the bottom ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]*a , b * ) , consistent with broken inversion symmetry in this system . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , because the presence of a surface breaks the @xmath9 screw symmetry , the surface states are also very different along the @xmath22 and @xmath23 directions of the surface bz . finally , we observe closed fermi surfaces which do not intersect weyl points and do not form fermi arcs . </S>",
    "<S> these extra fermi surfaces reflect how different ways of annihilating the weyl points would give rise to an insulator with a different topological invariant ( see the discussion below ) . </S>",
    "<S> we present a particularly simple set of fermi arcs arising near the @xmath24 point in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]*e * , including surface states from both the top and bottom surfaces . to visualize the arc nature of the surface states , we present three energy dispersion cuts along the directions indicated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]*e*. along cut 1 , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]*f * , we see a dirac cone connecting the bulk valence and conduction bands across the bulk band gap , exactly like a topological insulator . along cut 2 , shown in fig .  [ fig3]*g * , we see the projected bulk weyl cones , with surface states which pass through the weyl points . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , in cut 3 , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]*h * , we observe a full band gap . </S>",
    "<S> the surface states along this cut are trivial because they do not connect across the bulk band gap . </S>"
