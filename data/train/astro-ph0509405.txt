    "galaxy  galaxy lensing , hereafter gg lensing , has become a premiere tool for constraining the nature of the dark matter halos of galaxies ( e.g. , brainerd 2004a , brainerd & blandford 2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "recent investigations of gg lensing have moved beyond the most basic constraints on the nature of the `` average '' dark matter halo , demonstrating that there are real physical differences between the halos of early  type and late  type galaxies , and that the halos are non - spherical ( e.g. , hoekstra et al .",

    ", gg lensing has been haunted by the possibility that a number of genuine satellite galaxies , in orbit about the lenses , could be mistakenly identified as sources .",
    "if such satellites are randomly oriented with respect to the lenses , their presence introduces noise in the measurement of the lensing signal .",
    "if the satellites are non  randomly oriented with respect to the lenses , this alters the observed lensing signal compared to the true signal that would be measured in the absence of such false sources .",
    "random orientations could be caused by tidal distortions at small distances from the host or , at larger distances , by the tendency of galaxies to form in preferential alignment within filaments ( e.g. , catelan et al .",

( 1996 ) used the clustering strength of faint galaxies to place limits on contamination of the gg lensing signal caused by satellites and concluded that the contamination was sufficiently small to be ignored .",
    "bernstein & norberg ( 2002 ) , hereafter bn , found that on scales @xmath4  kpc , the mean tangential ellipticity of satellites in the two degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; colless et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ) was consistent with zero , and concluded that the contamination of the gg lensing signal was @xmath5% .",

    "here we use the fourth data release ( dr4 ) of the sdss ( adelman  mccarthy et al .",
    "2005 ) to revisit the question of whether satellite galaxies have a preferred orientation with respect to their hosts .",
    "throughout we adopt @xmath8  km  sec@xmath9  kpc@xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "hosts and satellites are selected by requiring : [ 1 ] the hosts are relatively isolated and [ 2 ] host  satellite pairs are nearby to one another in terms of projected separation , @xmath12 , and radial velocity difference , @xmath13 .",
    "specifically , hosts must be 2.5 times more luminous than any other galaxy that falls within @xmath14  kpc and @xmath15  km  sec@xmath9 .",
    "satellites must be at least 4 times less luminous than their host , and must be located within @xmath16  kpc and @xmath17  km  sec@xmath9 .",
    "we use only galaxies with redshift confidence parameter @xmath18 and , to avoid systematics due to overlapping isophotes , we use only those satellites that are located at radii larger than three times the scale radius , @xmath19 , of their host .",
    "lastly , we visually inspect the images of all candidate satellites that are found within @xmath20  kpc , and we reject those which have been misidentified as `` galaxies '' in the database .",
    "only 6.5% of the candidate satellites within 50  kpc are rejected this way , and these consist of either a star or a bright blue knot that has been misidentified as a small , faint galaxy .",
    "implementation of all our criteria yields a final sample of 3180 hosts and 4289 satellites .",
    "the median redshift of the hosts is @xmath21 .",
    "distributions of observed @xmath22band apparent magnitudes , the difference in observed @xmath22 magnitude , and k  corrected colors are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "corrections were obtained from version 3.2 of michael blanton s idl code ( e.g. , blanton et al .  2003 ) .",
    "since the satellites are large and well  resolved , their images are not greatly affected by local anisotropies in the psf and , therefore , we make no corrections to their image shapes below .",
    "we use the @xmath22-band position angles of the satellites to compute @xmath23 , the angle between the major axes of the satellites and the direction vectors on the sky that connect the centroids of the hosts and their satellites .",
    "we restrict @xmath23 to the range @xmath24 $ ] , where @xmath25 corresponds to a radial orientation of the satellite in the direction of its host and @xmath26 corresponds to a tangential orientation . shown in the top panels of fig .",
    "2 are the differential probability distribution , @xmath27 , and continuous cumulative probability distribution , @xmath28 , for the orientations of the satellites .",
    "the data in both panels are inconsistent with random distributions .",
    "a @xmath29 test performed on @xmath27 rejects the random distribution at the 99.93% confidence level , while a kolmogorov  smirnov ( ks ) test performed on @xmath28 rejects a random distribution at the 99.94% confidence level . from the top panels of fig .  2 ,",
    "then , there is a preference for the satellites to be elongated in the direction of their hosts .    0.1 cm    shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "2 is a null test in which unsaturated stars with magnitudes similar to those of the satellite galaxies are used to compute @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the stellar sample consists of 92,489 stars in the sdss photometric database that have @xmath30 and are found within projected radii @xmath31  kpc of each host galaxy .",
    "here @xmath19 is again the scale radius of the host galaxy . both @xmath27 and @xmath28 for the stars",
    "are consistent with random distributions and we are , therefore , confident that the non  random orientation of the satellites shown in the top panels of fig .  2 is unlikely to be caused by systematics in the imaging ( e.g. , drift ",
    "scanning , overlapping image isophotes , and/or classical aberrations ) .",
    "we specifically do not perform a null test that is sometimes performed in gg lensing : the substitution of the images of the hosts for those of the satellites .",
    "that is , if the `` lens '' galaxies are foreground objects and the `` source '' galaxies are background objects , the images of the sources should be tangentially aligned with respect to the lenses but the images of the lenses should be randomly oriented with respect to the sources .",
    "this pre  supposes that the centroids of the sources are distributed uniformly around the lenses ; however , this is not the case for our satellites .",
    "brainerd ( 2005 ) showed that satellites are found preferentially close to the major axes of their hosts .",
    "that is , the major axes of the hosts point preferentially toward the locations of their satellites ( i.e. , the hosts are radially aligned along the direction vectors that connect the centroids of the hosts with their satellites ) .",
    "indeed , the satellites in our present sample have a mean location angle of @xmath32 relative to the major axes of their hosts , consistent with the results of brainerd ( 2005 ) .",
    "the combination of the results of brainerd ( 2005 ) and our results in fig .  2 lead to the conclusion that host galaxies and their satellites are intrinsically aligned on small scales .",
    "we quantify this by computing a two  point correlation function of the shapes of the hosts and their satellites : @xmath33 .",
    "this is analogous to a function used in weak lensing to measure correlated distortions in the images of lensed galaxies as a function of the separation of the images on the sky ( e.g. , blandford et al .",
    "1991 ) . here",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 are shape parameters for the hosts and satellites , respectively , where @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the position angle of a galaxy , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are its major and minor axes , and @xmath40 .",
    "the mean , denoted by angle brackets , is computed over all pairs of hosts and satellites separated by projected radii @xmath41 .",
    "host and satellite images that are uncorrelated yield @xmath42 , while host and satellite images that are aligned yield positive values of @xmath43 .",
    "solid circles in the top panel of fig .",
    "3 show @xmath43 for our hosts and satellites , where it is clear that on scales @xmath0  kpc the images of the hosts and satellites are aligned with each other . on scales @xmath44  kpc , the images of the hosts and satellites show no apparent correlation , consistent with the lack of large scale intrinsic alignment of sdss galaxies reported by mandelbaum et al.(2005b ) . for comparison , open circles in the top panel of fig .",
    "2 show @xmath45 computed using the shape parameters of the hosts and the stars with @xmath30 that are nearby to the hosts . unlike the images of the hosts and satellites , the images of the hosts and nearby stars",
    "are uncorrelated , and we conclude that the apparent correlation of host and satellite images on scales @xmath0  kpc is unlikely to be caused by imaging systematics .",
    "0.1 cm    since our satellites are not randomly oriented with respect to their hosts , and because a non  random orientation has potentially important implications for gg lensing , we use the satellites to compute the standard weak lensing quantity known as the mean tangential shear , @xmath46 .",
    "the tangential ellipticity for each satellite , @xmath47 , is computed as @xmath48 where again @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the angle between the major axis of the satellite and the tangent to the direction vector that connects the centroids of the host and satellite .",
    "a simple , unweighted mean of the individual values of @xmath51 is used to compute @xmath46 .",
    "a positive value of @xmath46 indicates tangential orientation of the satellite images while a negative value of @xmath46 indicates radial orientation .",
    "solid squares in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "3 show @xmath46 for the sdss satellites , computed as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "open squares show @xmath46 for stars with @xmath30 that are nearby to the hosts . as expected from fig .  2",
    ", the satellites have a negative value of @xmath46 ( most notably on scales @xmath52  kpc ) and @xmath46 for the stars is consistent with zero .",
    "in particular , for satellites with @xmath53 , the mean tangential shear is @xmath1 .",
    "although the sign of @xmath46 is the opposite of what one expects in gravitational lensing , the magnitude of @xmath46 is comparable to what one would expect from galaxy  mass lenses with similar impact parameters . shown in fig .",
    "3 for comparison are the expected functions @xmath54 for four simple scenarios in which lens galaxies are modeled as singular isothermal spheres with velocity dispersion @xmath55 .",
    "the lenses are located at redshift @xmath56 and the sources are located at redshift @xmath57 .",
    "the values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 are similar to the actual median redshifts in current gg lensing studies , and the values of @xmath55 roughly span the range of values that have been inferred for lens galaxies from gg lensing",
    ".    if a significant number of unidentified satellite galaxies are present amongst the `` source '' galaxies in a gg lensing data set , a substantial reduction of the true shear could result .",
    "contamination by satellites is most likely to occur when lenses and sources have been identified solely on the basis of apparent magnitude ( i.e. , `` bright '' galaxies are identified as lenses and `` faint '' galaxies are identified as sources ) . in these cases , the typical difference in apparent magnitude between the `` sources '' and the `` lenses '' is of order 2 to 2.5 magnitudes , which is similar to the magnitude difference between the hosts and satellites in our sample ( see also bn ) .",
    "in addition , the vast majority of the sdss satellites have apparent magnitudes that are fainter than the vast majority of the sdss hosts , so it is reasonable to estimate the degree to which bright satellites might contaminate the gg lensing signal in a data set that has a similar range of magnitude differences amongst its `` bright '' and `` faint '' galaxies . in the magnitude range @xmath30 , then , we find that genuine satellite galaxies account for @xmath58% to @xmath59% of the _ total _ number of sdss galaxies that surround the host galaxies over scales @xmath60 , where @xmath61 .",
    "if we use a conservative estimate of 10% for the satellite contamination of the gg lensing signal , then , over scales @xmath62  kpc our observed elongation of satellites in the direction of their hosts reduces the true tangential shear for the model lenses in fig .  3 by an amount between 25%@xmath635% ( high  redshift lens with @xmath64  km  sec@xmath9 ) and 40%@xmath6310% ( low  redshift lens with @xmath65  km  sec@xmath9 ) .",
    "the cause of the elongation of the satellites in the direction of their hosts is likely to be twofold . on small scales , distortions caused by the gravitational interaction of the satellites with their hosts",
    "may occur , leading to tidal streams .",
    "we have examined the images of @xmath66 of the brightest hosts and a handful ( @xmath67 ) do seem to show the presence of faint tidal streams that connect the hosts and satellites . on large scales , the orientation of the satellites most likely reflects the tendency for galaxies to form in rough alignment along filaments .    the only previous study to which our work is directly comparable is that of bn , who selected hosts and satellites in a manner similar to ours .",
    "bn , however , concluded that the tangential ellipticity of the 2dfgrs satellites was consistent with zero .",
    "there are a number of factors that contribute to this discrepancy .",
    "first , our work is based on a larger number of satellites ( 4289 vs.  1819 ) . the difference in the number of satellites",
    "is caused largely by the fact that bn s satellites are much fainter than the majority of the satellites used here .",
    "second , bn computed the tangential ellipticity over a large aperture of radius 500  kpc , and we find that the preferential alignment of the satellites is restricted to @xmath68  kpc .",
    "third , the fraction of `` interlopers '' ( i.e. , galaxies identified as satellites but which are not dynamically associated with the host ) is likely to be larger in bn than here .",
    "this is due to a combination of the facts that the radial velocity errors are larger in the 2dfgrs than they are in the sdss ( @xmath69  km  sec@xmath9 vs.  @xmath70  km  sec@xmath9 ) and that the interloper fraction increases substantially with projected radius ( e.g. , prada et al .",
    "2003 ; brainerd 2004b ) . finally , the resolution of the satellite images used by bn is likely to have been lower than the resolution of the sdss satellite images used here .",
    "this is in part due to the fact that bn restricted their satellites to be at least 7.6 times fainter than their host ( so , on average , their satellites would have subtended a smaller angle on the sky than our sdss satellites ) .",
    "in addition , the imaging of bn s satellites was based on scans of glass plates with a pixel scale of @xmath71 , compared to a ccd pixel scale of @xmath72 in the sdss .    to compare to bn",
    ", we have converted sdss magnitudes to the @xmath73band using the photometric transformation of norberg et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , @xmath74 , and have identified isolated hosts and their satellites in the dr4 using the same criteria as bn .",
    "specifically , hosts must be at least 7.6 times brighter than any other galaxy located within @xmath75  kpc and @xmath15  km  sec@xmath9 , and satellites consist of all galaxies found within @xmath75  kpc and @xmath17  km  sec@xmath9 of a host . implementing these criteria yields 1074  hosts and 1467 satellites , from which we compute @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "when all satellites with @xmath75  kpc are used , both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are consistent with random distributions ( @xmath29 rejection confidence level of 61.1% and ks rejection confidence level of 49.3% ) .",
    "when only those satellites with @xmath16  kpc ( i.e. , the maximum @xmath12 for our satellites ) are used , the total number of satellites is reduced by @xmath76% and both @xmath27 and @xmath28 remain consistent with random distributions ( @xmath29 rejection confidence level of 48.2% and ks rejection confidence level of 83.8% ) .",
    "thus , when selected in a comparable manner , the sdss galaxies yield results that are consistent with bn s .",
    "in addition , we have applied our selection criteria from  2 to the final data release of the 2dfgrs , resulting in a sample of 2054 hosts and 2663 satellites .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the images of the satellites shows a weak tendency for them to be elongated in the direction of their hosts ; a uniform distribution for the 2dfrgs satellites is rejected at the 95.4% confidence level by the @xmath29 test and at the 91.8% confidence level by the ks test .",
    "averaged over scales @xmath53 , the mean tangential shear of the 2dfgrs satellites is @xmath77 , in modest agreement with our measurement for the sdss dr4 satellites .",
    "we will further explore the distortion of satellite images in both the sdss and 2dfgrs , including possible dependencies on host luminosity and spectral type , in a future paper ( brainerd et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we find that on scales @xmath52  kpc satellite galaxies are elongated in the direction of their hosts . in addition , on scales @xmath0  kpc the images of the hosts and their satellites are aligned with each other .",
    "a decade ago the first tentative detections of gg lensing yielded only noisy constraints on the shear , and the presence of non  randomly oriented satellites amongst the lensed sources could be largely ignored .",
    "our results here , however , suggest that in the future great care must be taken to reject satellite galaxies ( via , e.g. , accurate photometric redshifts ) in order for `` precision shear '' observations of gg lensing to result in truly precision constraints on the nature of dark galaxy halos .",
