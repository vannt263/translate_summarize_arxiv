    "it is sensitive to intrinsic sizes of radiation sources in much the same way that optical scintillation from atmospheric turbulence is quenched for planets while strong for stars .",
    "however , interstellar scintillation differs from the atmospheric case in that it can resolve sources at angular resolutions much smaller than those achievable with available apertures , including the longest baselines used in , even those using space antennas . optical techniques such as intensity interferometry , speckle interferometry and adaptive optics typically only _ restore _ the telescope resolution to what it would be in the absence of any atmospheric turbulence .    figure  [ fig : turb.ss1133 + 16 ] shows the power spectrum of the dynamic spectrum in figure  [ fig : turb.ds1133 + 16 ] that reveals low - level arc like features that are caused by interference between wide - angle and weakly scattered radiation .",

    "intraday variability ( idv ) refers to the hourly to daily intensity fluctuations exhibited by approximately 15% of all compact , flat - spectrum extragalactic sources at centimeter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon was first identified as `` flickering '' on time scales of less than two days @xcite , and variations on timescales of less than twelve hours were reported soon after @xcite .",
    "it was unclear whether the variations were intrinsic to the sources themselves or a result of propagation effects in the .",
    "initial tentative evidence in support of the former @xcite was particularly concerning because it implied source brightness temperatures in excess of  @xmath59  , well above the inverse compton limit . the problem was exacerbated by the discovery of 4060  min .",
    "variations in pks  0405@xmath60385 @xcite for which the variations , if intrinsic , would imply a brightness temperature @xmath61  .",
    "it is now clear that the varations are not solely intrinsic to the sources themselves but are due at least partially , if not fully , to .",
    "the case for iss hinges on two distinct observational properties of idv sources .",
    "the first is the measurement of significant time delays between widely separated telescopes in the variability patterns of the three fastest idv sources , pks  0405@xmath60385 @xcite , j1819@xmath623845 @xcite , and pks  1257@xmath60326 @xcite .",
    "the delay arises because the intensity fluctuations caused by the scattering medium move across the line of sight with a finite speed ( which is a vector sum between the earth and medium s velocities ) , so that there is a finite delay between the intensity fluctuations observed on @xmath63  km baselines .",
    "the effectiveness of this technique depends on the ability to measure significant flux density changes on timescales shorter than the time delay between the two telescopes , typically 30600  s. time delay experiments have so far been limited to only the three strong sources whose variations are sufficiently strong and rapid .",
    "the second is that annual cycles in the variability timescales of the fluctuations are observed in a number of idv sources .",
    "this cycle arises because the speed of the scattering medium responsible for the iss is comparable to earth s orbital speed around the sun .",
    "the scintillation fluctuations are slowest when the earth moves parallel to the scattering medium and are fastest when earth moves antiparallel to the medium .",
    "annual cycles have now been found for five sources , including j1819@xmath623845 @xcite , b0917@xmath62624 @xcite , and pks  1257@xmath60326 @xcite , and there is increasing evidence ( e.g. , from the masiv survey @xcite ) that it is present in a number of other sources exhibiting centimeter - wavelength .",
    "this technique has established iss as the principal mechanism responsible for idv for sources whose variations are too slow ( @xmath64  hr ) to be amenable to time delay experiments .",
    "the variations in idv sources generally exhibit the largest fractional modulations at frequencies @xmath65ghz .",
    "faster , less highly modulated variations are observed at higher frequencies , while the variations at lower frequencies are much slower with considerably lower amplitude .",
    "the change in the character of the scintillations is interpreted in terms of a transition between weak and strong , with the slow variations at lower frequencies being due to riss and the faster variations at higher frequencies being due to .",
    "the small diameters required to exhibit iss imply uncomfortably high brightness temperatures for idv sources .",
    "a source must be no more than tens of microarcseconds in diameter to display idv at  5  ghz for a scattering screen at a distance of order 100  pc (  [ sec : turb.regimes ] ) .",
    "brightness temperatures of order @xmath66  k have been determined for b1257@xmath60326 and j1819@xmath623845 while the lower limit for b1519@xmath60273 is @xmath67  k and it could be as high as @xmath68  k @xcite . while these brightness temperatures are lower than early estimates , in which the variations were interpreted as being solely intrinsic , they are still well above the inverse compton limit .",
    "doppler beaming can reduce these estimates further , but the required doppler factors are as high as several hundred @xcite , significantly higher than seen in existing vlbi surveys @xcite .",
    "further information about source structure can be obtained by utilizing polarization .",
    "even a rudimentary analysis shows that the linearly polarized structure of j1819@xmath623845 at  5  ghz consists of at least two separate sources , separated by roughly 50  @xmath18as and indicates their location relative to the rest of the unpolarized emission .",
    "analysis of the total intensity and circular polarization fluctuations in pks  1519@xmath60273 indicates that this source consists of a 1535  @xmath18as core with an extremely high circular polarization of @xmath69% @xcite .",
    "continuing observations of this source indicate the intermittent generation of circular polarization of opposite handedness in the core , suggesting that the source undergoes small , otherwise undetectable , outbursts every few months .",
    "the sensitivity of the ska is such that it potentially will probe the _ nanoarcsecond _ scale of extragalactic sources",
    ". it should be capable of detecting scintillating sources as much as three orders of magnitude fainter than those detected currently . assuming that these fainter sources have incoherent synchrotron components in them , the implied angular scales are at least one and possibly two orders of magnitude smaller , so on the 1  @xmath18as to  100  nas scales .",
    "one microarcsecond corresponds to about  1  light - week at cosmological distances , and it is on these scales that jets are expected to be `` launched . ''",
    "if there are such compact sources , the scintillation timescales would be even faster and modulation indices potentially higher ; diss might even be detected .",
    "observations of time delays between stokes parameters will yield differential source structure , and monitoring these delays will lead to the evolution of these components .",
    "a small number of pulsars have displayed `` strong fringing events '' in their dynamic spectra , in which the normal , random appearance of the dynamic spectrum is modified by the appearance of quasi - periodic fringes ( figure  [ fig : turb.ds1133 + 16 ] ) .",
    "these fringes are interpreted most naturally as the beating of two distinct images of the pulsar .",
    "multiple imaging of a pulsar can occur if there is a temporary increase in the power on refractive scales ( @xmath70  cm ) along the line of sight , e.g. , as due to a discrete `` cloud '' of electrons drifting in front of the pulsar @xcite .",
    "the fringe spacing in the dynamic spectrum can be related to the angular separation of the multiple images formed by the strong refraction .",
    "the typical angular separation in the observed cases is a few milliarcseconds @xcite .",
    "moreover , in order for fringes to occur , the multiple images must be at least partially coherent . consequently , the strong refraction forms an interferometer with an effective baseline of  1  , and angular resolution of  1  @xmath18as . in",
    "the cases observed , the fringes displayed a dependence on pulse phase , which in turn indicated that the size of the emitting region must be of order @xmath71  cm .",
    "the duty cycle of strong fringing effects , though not known with precision , is small ; it is not clear if the discrete density structures occur along a few , specific lines of sight or if the discrete density structures are ubiquitous but have a small filling factor .",
    "multiple imaging is also expected from agn undergoing `` extreme scattering events '' ( ese ) @xcite .",
    "because of their intrinsically larger diameters , diss does not occur and dynamic spectra are not determined .",
    "imaging of a source undergoing an ese may show the multiple imaging , if the image separation is larger than the scattering diameter .",
    "unfortunately , the only vlbi observations of a source undergoing an ese do not included the egress of the source from the , when the image separation is predicted to be the largest @xcite .",

    "our heuristic descriptions of scattering observables and scintillation regimes can be cast more rigorously in terms of moments of the electric field .",

    "can not be obtained for all desired moments of the field in all scattering regimes , but the various moments can be shown to be related to moments of the radio wave phase , and as such , can be related to the phase and density fluctuation power spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a useful parameterization of the spatial power spectrum of the interstellar density fluctuations ( like those in the interplanetary medium ) is a power law , @xmath73 here @xmath74 is the spatial wavenumber ; @xmath75 is the inner scale or smallest length scale on which fluctuations are maintained ; and @xmath76 , which is slowly varying with distance ( @xmath77 ) , describes the strength of the fluctuations along the line of sight , and is proportional to the rms density .",
    "although not incorporated explicitly into equation  ( [ eqn : turb.spectrum ] ) , there is presumably also an outer scale  @xmath78 describing the largest length scales on which density fluctuations are maintained .",

    "this combination , the value for @xmath2 and the plasma reynolds number , suggests that the interstellar density fluctuations are the result of a turbulent process .",
    "there are a number of significant caveats to this conclusion .",
    "kolmogorov turbulence theory was developed initially for a neutral , incompressible medium ",
    "assumptions that the ism clearly violates .",
    "if interstellar scattering is an observational manifestion of turbulence , the implied inertial range ( between  @xmath75 and  @xmath78 ) is at least 5 orders of magnitude and potentially as much as 10 orders of magnitude , and it is not clear how to sustain such a large inertial range .",
    "moreover , strong refractive events (  [ sec : turb.ese ] ) likely indicate the presence of discrete density structures .",
    "much progress , on both the observational and theoretical fronts , has been made in the past decade in explaining the density fluctuations responsible for interstellar scattering in terms of turbulence .",
    "from the theoretical perspective , the ( mean ) magnetic field energy density in the interstellar plasma is comparable to or much greater the gas kinetic energy density or thermal pressure .",
    "thus , a theory for turbulence in magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) must be used . on the one hand",
    ", an mhd approach seems attractive as , for instance , density fluctuations are a natural result of alfvn waves . on the other hand ,",
    "it is probable that , at least on some spatial scales , the nonlinear terms in the mhd equations are important and a perturbative approach is not valid . over the past decade , there has been a renewed interest in understanding mhd turbulence as it applies to interstellar density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "a key aspect of a turbulent description , though , is that on the smallest spatial scales the kinetic energy of the turbulence is dissipated and heats the medium .",
    "cooling mechanisms within the medium must be capable of radiating this heat lest a `` thermodynamic catastrophe '' result @xcite .",
    "estimates of the dissipation heating from various damping mechanisms can be used to constrain the nature of the turbulence @xcite .    on the observational front",
    ", there has also been considerable progess in establishing that there are magnetic field fluctuations accompanying ( or more likely driving ) the density fluctuations responsible for scattering .",
    "rm and em structure function analyses across several degrees of sky show the structure functions to have power - law spectra , at least on scales less than roughly 1  pc , consistent with what is expected from a turbulent process @xcite .",
    "importantly , the rm structure function analyses require both magnetic field and density fluctuations , as expected if the density fluctuations result from magnetic field fluctuations in a turbulent magnetized fluid .      in mhd turbulence",
    ", it is expected that density fluctuations would be aligned along the field direction and potentially be highly anisotropic .",
    "if the density fluctuations are elongated , scattering observables would be affected , e.g. , scattering disks of sources would be anisotropic .",
    "such an effect is seen in the solar wind .",
    "a small number of highly scattered sources do display anisotropic scattering disks , with typical aspect ratios of a few .",

    "if the path length through the scattering medium is much longer than the outer scale , averaging would reduce the observed aspect ratio well below the intrinsic aspect ratio of the density fluctuations .",
    "more recently , idv observations suggest that density fluctuations in the more general ionized interstellar medium ( as opposed to particularly heavily scattered lines of sight ) may also be anisotropic .",

    "( the power law may extend to lower energies , but solar modulation becomes increasingly important at lower energies . ) jokipii  @xcite has argued that these characteristics of cosmic rays require a wide - band spectrum of magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "the absence of any `` breaks '' or `` bumps '' in the spectrum as well as an isotropic arrival direction indicate that a typical cosmic ray undergoes many scatterings during its lifetime .",
    "cosmic rays are scattered most effectively by magnetic field fluctuations on length scales near their gyroradii . in this energy range ,",
    "the relevant gyroradii are @xmath94@xmath85  cm , suggesting that the spectrum of magnetic field fluctuations encompasses at least this range of length scales .",
    "as described above , there is modest evidence from rm structure function analyses for magnetic field fluctuations at the upper end of these length scales , while refractive effects and dm monitoring programs can probe density fluctuations at the lower end of these length scales .    the large number of scatterings that cosmic rays experience also makes them of limited utility in studying the magnetic field fluctuations , other than indicating that magnetic field fluctuations may exist .",
    "the diffuse galactic gamma - ray emission at energies @xmath95  mev results from the interaction of cosmic rays with the interstellar matter and radiation fields @xcite and suffers essentially no absorption or scattering over galactic distances . as such it is a powerful diagnostic of the galactic distribution and propagation of cosmic rays .",
    "typical models for the diffuse @xmath1-ray emission utilize expressions like equation  ( [ eqn : turb.g - rayi ] ) in which @xmath24 is approximated by the hydrogen distribution  @xmath25 and @xmath27 is taken to be constant or slowly varying .",
    "these models have proven quite successful in reproducing the large - scale features  an enhancement in the inner galaxy and spiral - arm tangents  seen in maps of @xmath96 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in such models , variations in @xmath96",
    "arise essentially from variations in @xmath25 . however , there are departures of the data from the model . in some famous cases , these are due to discrete sources ( geminga , crab pulsar , vela pulsar ) while in others , they are essentially unidentified `` hot spots '' in the gamma - rays",
    ".    `` hot spots '' and other variations in @xmath96 might also result from fluctuations in @xmath27 .",
    "in particular , magnetic fluctuations can act not only to scatter cosmic rays , but also to confine them @xcite .",
    "therefore , enhancements in @xmath96 could result either from an increase in the ambient matter density or from a longer cosmic - ray residence time in regions of enhanced magnetic turbulence or both .",
    "if the density fluctuations responsible for interstellar scattering result from the same magnetic fluctuations responsible for cosmic - ray confinement , as appears likely on at least the largest scales , radio - wave scattering data can be used to _ predict _",
    "conversely , _",

    "little has been done to test these ideas , due at least in part to the fairly coarse angular resolution of @xmath1-ray telescopes . in comparison to the sub - arcsecond resolution of the radio telescopes",
    "typically used to study interstellar scattering , past @xmath1-ray telescopes have had angular resolutions of a few degrees or worse .",
    "more problematic , these angular resolutions also have been fairly coarse when compared with the diameter of a typical scattering region over galactic distances .",
    "for instance , a region 1  pc in diameter at a distance of  8  kpc ( comparable to the mean free path between intense scattering regions @xcite ) subtends an angle of only @xmath97 .",
    "the effects we describe may nonetheless be detectable with future @xmath1-ray instruments with higher angular resolutions operating during the ska s lifetime .    not only could comparisons of radio and @xmath1-ray observations yield information about the magnetic field on sub - parsec scales , but radio observations could be used to improve models for the galactic distribution of the diffuse @xmath1-ray emission .    the diffuse galactic @xmath1-ray emission can ( probably does ! ) obscure faint point and small - diameter sources ( neutron stars , black holes , @xmath1-ray blazars , young supernova remnants , or even an as - yet unidentified class of @xmath1-ray emitters ) .",
    "for example , there are presumably more geminga - like @xmath1-ray pulsars in the galaxy . separating more distant and/or intrinsically weaker @xmath1-ray point sources from the diffuse emission requires better understanding of the diffuse emission , particularly on smaller angular scales . indeed , the detection of geminga itself may have been somewhat fortuitous in that it was both nearby and toward the galactic anticenter , where the diffuse emission is less intense .",
    "the conventional factorization of the density spectrum allows for different lines of sight to have similar microphysics ( wavenumber scaling ) but differing scattering strengths ( coefficient  @xmath98 ) .",
    "values for , the line - of - sight integral of  @xmath98 , can be estimated from angular broadening measurements of extragalactic sources or galactic sources ( typically pulsars or masers ) , pulse broadening measurements for pulsars , or scintillation bandwidth measurements for pulsars . in general ,",
    "only angular broadening measurements of extragalactic sources yield sm directly . for the other kinds of measurements ,",
    "a line - of - sight weighting of the scattering material must be taken into account in order to extract ; for angular broadening of galactic sources , scattering material close to the observer is most strongly weighted while for pulse broadening and scintillation bandwidth scattering material mid - way between the pulsar and observer is most strongly weighted .",
    "comparisons of sm along different lines of sight yield the angular distribution of density fluctuations , which can be inverted to obtain a spatial distribution , while comparisons of sm on similar lines of sight ( e.g. , pulsar vs.  agn ) constrain the _ radial _ distribution of density fluctuations . for pulsars , in principle ,",
    "one also can compare the magnitude of angular broadening to the pulse broadening or scintillation bandwidth to obtain the line - of - sight weighting directly .",
    "although measurements of only sm can be used to obtain the angular distribution of density fluctuations , they are much more powerful when combined with measurements of pulsar dms , and pulsar parallaxes to produce three - dimensional models for the galactic distribution of the interstellar plasma .",
    "the most recent effort is the ne2001 model ( so named because it is based on data obtained up to  2001 , @xcite , figure  [ fig : turb.ne2001 ] ) , which uses roughly 1200 pulsar dms , 300 measurements of , and  100 measurements of dm - independent pulsar distances ( e.g. , parallaxes or pulsar - supernova remnant associations ) .",
    "not only does this model describe the galactic distribution of the interstellar plasma , it can be used to predict the distances of pulsars from their dms .        the ne2001 model ( like many of its predecessors ) describes the galaxy in terms of large - scale components  a thin disk , a thick disk , and spiral arms .",
    "although less true than in some previous models , the sm and dm measurements still play a largely complementary role in the ne2001 model .",
    "most pulsars are relatively faint so their dms probe the interstellar plasma only relatively nearby ( @xmath38  kpc ) ; most measurements of sm are toward extragalactic sources so the lines of sight are relatively long ( @xmath99  kpc ) .",
    "the combination of the dm and sm values thus allows for the possibility of a global model . with the increasing number of distant pulsars and their dms , particularly from the parkes multi - beam survey ,",
    "the ne2001 model is perhaps more equitable in the balance between dm and sm for long lines of sight , though the sm values remain important .",
    "a novel feature of the ne2001 model is the systematic introduction of `` clumps '' and `` voids , '' regions of enhanced or decreased electron density and/or scattering .",
    "previous models had contained a localized enhancement ( clump ) due to the gum nebula because it is so close to the sun , but the current number of measurements of dm and sm is becoming sufficient that not only large - scale features ( e.g. , diffuse ionized disk , spiral arms ) can be modeled but also mesoscale structures ( e.g. , hii regions ) . on a limited number of lines of sight , reasonable agreement between a modeled and observed quantity ( dm and/or sm ) could be obtained only by inserting either a clump or a void .",
    "the ska will provide qualitatively new means of constructing global models .",
    "one of the key science projects for the ska is a pulsar census of the galaxy ( kramer et al .",
    ", this volume ; cordes et al .",
    ", this volume ) , which will necessarily include the dms for all of the pulsars found .",
    "it is expected that such a census will increase the number of pulsars by a substantial factor ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "we expect that the number of pulsar parallaxes will also increase by a similar amount .",
    "the number of pulsars will be sufficiently large that there should be several per degree along the galactic plane .",
    "consequently , the lines of sight to distant pulsars will have a reasonable probability of intersecting an hii region even over galactic distances ( @xmath99  kpc ) .",
    "the density of pulsars on the sky will decrease with increasing galactic latitude of course , but these can be supplemented with scattering measurements and idv observations . assuming that the density of idv sources on the sky is sufficiently high , the characteristic frequency at which idv is strongest can be determined as a function of galactic latitude , in a manner analogous to observations of interplanetary scintillation at lower frequencies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we suggest that the number of measurements provided by the ska will be sufficiently large that it will be possible to trace the galaxy s structure , or at least its spiral structure , in a self - consistent manner , rather than by imposing it as has been done for the ne2001 and previous models",
    ". the methodology would be to insert clumps of increased electron density , representing hii regions , along the line of sight to pulsars and extragalactic sources .",
    "the clumps would be inserted in a parsimonious manner so as to minimize the difference between observed and predicted dms and sms with the minimum number of clumps .",
    "as spiral arms are not smooth structures , voids may also need to be inserted in a similar manner .",
    "moreover , combining scattering measurements , e.g. , pulsar pulse broadening and angular broadening , would constrain the _ radial _ distribution of scattering ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    a second key science project ( see chapter by gaensler , this volume ) , is the production of a grid of extragalactic sources with measured rms .",
    "although not used to date in constructing models for the galactic distribution of the interstellar plasma , such a grid offers exciting possibilities for expanding the ne2001 model ( or its successors ) to describe the magnetoionic medium in terms of both @xmath10 and  @xmath101 .",
    "idv sources are excellent probes of the scattering material within roughly 1050  pc of the sun .",
    "the prominence of such local scattering material in idv scattering would , at first sight , appear to be surprising , since pulsar radiation tends to be scattered at greater distances .",
    "however , for wiss and , the finite angular diameters of idv sources produce a weighting with nearby scattering material being most important .",
    "this effect arises because wiss and riss tend to be dominated by scattering material whose distances are such that the angular diameter of the first fresnel zone closely matches the source angular diameter @xcite .",
    "the combination of a large number of idv measurements along with pulsar scattering measurements and parallaxes should yield similar qualitative advances in the description of the local .",

    "interstellar scintillation indicates that at least some lines of sight through igm are not scattered appreciably .",

    "for redshifts @xmath102 , the absence of a gunn - peterson trough in quasar spectra indicates that the igm is largely ionized , and recent far - ultraviolet and soft x - ray observations of highly ionized species ( e.g. , o  vi ) along the line of sight to various low - redshift quasars may be a direct detection of the ionized igm @xcite . in the prevailing `` cosmic web '' scenario for large - scale structure formation ,",
    "most of the baryons are in filamentary structures which are themselves permeated by shocks .",

    "such an angular resolution is at the limit of what can be achieved with terrestrial baselines .",
