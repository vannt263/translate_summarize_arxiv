    "the x - ray transient sax j1808.4 - 3658 was discovered in september 1996 when it exhibited an outburst detected by the bepposax wide field cameras ( in t zand et al .",
    "the source showed type - i x - ray bursts that led to the identification of the compact object as a neutron star ( hereafter ns ) and to the derivation of a distance of about @xmath5 kpc ( in t zand et al .",
    "the source was found in outburst again in april 1998 , when the high temporal resolution of the proportional counter array ( pca ) on - board the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) , allowed the discovery of coherent @xmath6 hz pulsations , making this source the first known accretion - driven millisecond pulsar ( wijnands & van der klis 1998 ) . timing analysis performed on data collected over the period @xmath7 april 1998 , allowed",
    "the determination of the orbital parameters reported in table [ tab1 ] ( chakrabarty & morgan 1998 , cm98 hereafter ) .",
    "sax j1808.4 - 3658 was again detected in outburst ( and observed with rxte / pca ) in january 2000 ( van der klis et al .",
    "2000 ) and in october 2002 ( see wijnands 2004 for a review ) .",
    "correct ephemerides are of capital importance for the study of this and similar systems , since these give us the possibility to monitor the evolution of the spin and the orbital period of the system .",
    "these , in turn , give important information on the mechanism of the acceleration of a ns to millisecond periods and on the evolutionary history of the system , respectively .",
    "orbital ephemerides are also important for performing studies , for instance , in other wavelengths . in particular",
    "any search for radio pulsations during quiescence ( to test the hypothesis that the radio pulsar switches on during quiescence ) needs correct orbital parameters to perform coherent search for pulsations and to improve by several orders of magnitude the detection sensitivity . in this paper",
    "we apply a temporal analysis on the three most recent outbursts of sax j1808.43658 in order to improve the orbital parameters of the system ; we find a new orbital solution which appears to be valid from 1998 to 2002 ( the entire period of the rxte observations of up to date ) . in ",
    "2 we present the timing technique we developed to obtain the revised estimate of the orbital period ; in  3 we apply this technique to the available rxte / pca datasets of the 1998 , 2000 , and 2002 outbursts of the source ; in  4 we draw our conclusions .",
    "let us consider a binary system of `` true '' orbital period @xmath8 , orbital separation @xmath9 , and negligible eccentricity in which a source ( hereafter the primary ) orbits the barycenter of the system at a radius @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the masses of the primary and its companion , the secondary , respectively ) .",
    "the orbital motion causes delays in the times of arrival , @xmath13 , of a signal  emitted by the primary at the time @xmath14  on the plane passing through the barycenter and perpendicular to the line of sight : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 $ ] is the distance of the primary from the plane defined above , @xmath17 is the inclination angle between the normal to the orbital plane and the line of sight , @xmath18 is the time of passage at the ascending node , and @xmath19 is the speed of light . with an observational estimate of the orbital parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , we can correct the arrival times of photons emitted by the primary for the delays induced by the orbital motion .",
    "a first order correction gives : @xmath23\\ ] ]    the high temporal resolution rxte data of span a period of @xmath24 yr , from april 1998 to october 2002 , during which performed @xmath25 orbital cycles and @xmath26 billion spin cycles . in order to perform a timing analysis over the whole @xmath27 we must unambiguously associate @xmath28 , i.e. the number of elapsed spin cycles since the 1998 outburst , to any given @xmath13 . neglecting any error on the spin period estimate @xmath29 , induced by the errors in the orbital correction ,",
    "this association would be possible if the intrinsic error on the estimate of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , is such that @xmath32 cm98 reported @xmath33 s , thus ruling out the possibility of making an overall timing analysis over @xmath27 .",
    "however , the large value of @xmath34 suggested us to develop a method of timing of the orbital period @xmath21 in order to improve the orbital period estimate of cm98 . our idea is to estimate the time of passage at a given point in the orbit , e.g. the ascending node @xmath22 , for any given orbital cycle @xmath35 , and to fit these times @xmath22s _ vs _ the corresponding @xmath35 to improve the estimate of @xmath21 and to give a value ( or an upper limit ) for the orbital period derivative @xmath36 .",
    "this timing can be done providing that : i ) we can unambiguously associate @xmath35 , i.e. the number of elapsed orbital cycles since the 1998 outburst , to any given @xmath37 .",
    "this is possible if the error on @xmath21 , @xmath38 , is such that @xmath39 .",
    "cm98 reported @xmath40 s , thus making this association possible ; ii ) we are able to estimate the @xmath22s for any orbital cycle @xmath35 with an error _ smaller _ than @xmath41 obtained from the propagation of the cm98 errors in the `` theoretical '' computation of the @xmath42 at a given @xmath35 as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the time of passage at the ascending node at the beginning of the 1998 outburst , estimated by cm98 .",
    "our strategy to estimate the values of @xmath22s relies on the fact that the correction of the photon arrival times with eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr ] ) induces a `` smearing '' in a pulse profile obtained by an epoch folding search performed on the corrected lightcurve because the corrections performed are affected by the errors in the estimate of the orbital parameters . indeed , simple differentiation of the doppler effect formula @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the speed along the line of sight , demonstrates that the leading term in the error induced by eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr ] ) on @xmath47 is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the orbital phase . since @xmath50 we have @xmath51 .",
    "this means that folding a lightcurve of length @xmath52 hour @xmath53 at a period close to @xmath47 results into delays up to @xmath54 . adopting the cm98 estimates of the orbital parameters and the related errors we get @xmath55 for the 2002 data , which means that a significant smearing is is induced by @xmath56 , which represents our ignorance of the `` true '' time of ascending node passage in the 2002 data determined by the original error on @xmath21 propagated through the factor @xmath34 .",
    "therefore we can `` experimentally '' estimate the @xmath22s in the 2000 and 2002 outbursts by correcting each @xmath52 hour length observation with eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr ] ) in which several trial values of @xmath22 are adopted .",
    "we then choose the @xmath22 for which the corresponding corrected lightcurve gives a folded pulse profile with minimum smearing , obtaining an error in the determination of that particular @xmath22 that is expected to be _ smaller _ than the corresponding @xmath57 selecting the lightcurve with the minimum smearing , the @xmath31 ( caused by the uncertainty in the knowledge of the true time of ascending node passage ) must induce a genuine broadening of the folded pulse profile , and not delays more or less constant during each observation that can be compensated , in the folding search procedure , by the selection of a different spin period .",
    "since the induced delays are not constant , but vary with time as @xmath58 , the epoch folding search procedure must be performed over a time span that is a relevant fraction of the orbital period , so that @xmath58 varies significantly .",
    "this condition is verified by our sample of observations that last @xmath52 hour @xmath53 . ] . since a folded pulse profile obtained by folding a lightcurve corrected with the `` true '' time of ascending node passage ( and",
    "therefore not smeared ) has a bigger pulsed fraction than one obtained by folding a lightcurve corrected with a `` wrong '' time of ascending node passage ( and therefore significantly smeared ) , the experimental estimate of each @xmath22 can be done by the following procedure : a ) for a given observation we produce a number of corrected lightcurves applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr ] ) with different values of the time of ascending node passage @xmath59 ; b )",
    "we then perform on each lightcurve an epoch folding search for periodicities fitting the @xmath0 _ vs _ spin period curve close to its maximum with a gaussian profile , to derive the maximum @xmath0 value , @xmath60 , for the given value of @xmath59 ; c ) we plot these @xmath60 _ vs _ their corresponding @xmath59 and we fit the part of this curve close to its maximum again with a gaussian choosing , as our experimental estimate of the time of passage at the ascending node @xmath22 , the value of @xmath59 for which this gaussian has a maximum .",
    "the uncertainties on @xmath22 are computed using post - fit residuals , i.e.  the average fluctuation of the @xmath22 values vs.  the orbital cycle number @xmath35 with respect the average trend ( see below ) .",
    "this is the more conservative way of estimating the errors in the case of data with similar statistical significance as expected since we have used datasets of comparable length ( see tab .",
    "1 ) : indeed the post - fit errors are @xmath61 times bigger than the errors based on a fit of the top of the gaussian .",
    "this technique supplies us with values of the epoch of ascending node passage @xmath62 that can be compared with the ones predicted using the original estimate of orbital parameters @xmath43 .",
    "we therefore plot the delays @xmath63 versus @xmath35 ( we note that @xmath35 is derived unambiguously as the integer part of @xmath64 under the assumption that @xmath65 that we have also verified _ a posteriori _ ) , fit the data with the relation @xmath66 and finally obtain our improved orbital parameters as @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "although we devoleped this technique independently , we subsequentely found that a similar one had already been used by paul et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and naik & paul ( 2004 ) .",
    "throughout this paper we used the too public domain data of the pca on - board rxte ( bradt et al .",
    "in particular , we analyzed data from the pca ( jahoda et al .",
    "1996 ) , which is composed by a set of five xenon proportional counters operating in the 260 kev energy range with a total effective area of @xmath73 @xmath74 .",
    "we considered a sample ( listed in table [ tab2 ] ) of the available pca observations of sax j1808.43658 taken during the 1998 , 2000 and 2002 outbursts in which the spin modulation was particularly strong . for the temporal analysis we used event mode data with 64 energy channels and @xmath75s temporal resolution ; the arrival times of all the events were reported to the solar system barycenter .",
    "for the first 2002 observation ( see table [ tab2 ] ) we produced a set of lightcurves performing orbital correction adopting eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr ] ) , with @xmath76 and @xmath21 as determined by cm98 .",
    "according to the method described above , we adopted different @xmath37 spanning a range around the predicted value resulting from @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is our initial guess of @xmath35 : @xmath79 , with @xmath80 the starting time of the first 2002 observation .",
    "the @xmath37 range spans @xmath81 s in steps of 2 s as @xmath82 s adopting the cm98 estimates .",
    "we then performed an epoch folding search on each corrected lightcurve , but , surprisingly , no pulsation was detected in any of them .",
    "thus we extended the range of trial values for @xmath37 to explore the entire orbit until we obtained lightcurves for which the epoch folding search produced @xmath0 peaks ( typically with maxima of @xmath83 over an average value of @xmath81 ) around periods close to @xmath47 . following the method described above we then fitted the curve of the maxima of the @xmath0 ( obtained from the epoch folding search on each lightcurve ) _ vs _ the corresponding @xmath37 with a gaussian and derived our best estimate of the time of ascending node passage for the first 2002 observation @xmath84 .",
    "we then estimated @xmath85 , i.e. the number of orbital cycles elapsed since @xmath44 as @xmath86 and therefore adopted a new estimate of the orbital period @xmath87 that is obtained from @xmath88 .",
    "we checked the consistency of our provisional estimate of the orbital period @xmath87 demonstrating that @xmath85 can be unambiguously associated to @xmath84 by verifying that @xmath89 .    with this new estimate we repeated the procedure described above on each observation listed in table [ tab2 ] , with different @xmath37 spanning a range of 40 s around the new predicted value resulting from @xmath90 , where @xmath91 , with @xmath92 the starting time of each observation .",
    "encouragingly we always detected the pulsation , although with different strength ( as deduced from the different maximum @xmath0 ) , by performing the epoch folding search on the corrected lightcurves .",
    "this allowed us to determine a set of 15 @xmath93 , one for each observation .    in fig .",
    "1 ( top and middle panel ) we plot the delays between the @xmath94 values and the values predicted adopting the cm98 estimates @xmath95 versus the number of orbital cycles elapsed since @xmath44 : where @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "it should be noted that all the delays are @xmath98 which demonstrates _ a posteriori _ the consistency of our method , since we were able to associate unambiguously @xmath35 to any @xmath94 .",

    "( [ eq : fit ] ) we find the improved orbital parameters and the first constraint on the orbital period derivative that are reported in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we finally corrected all the observations using eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr ] ) with the improved value of the orbital period @xmath99 and again we produced , for each observation , a set of lightcurves with different @xmath37 spanning a range around the predicted value resulting from @xmath100 that allowed us to determine the new set of 15 @xmath101 .",
    "we finally computed the `` post fit '' residuals as @xmath102 in order to check if the residuals were now compatible with zero . in fig .",
    "1 ( bottom panel ) we plotted @xmath103 versus @xmath35 to demonstrate the consistency of our method .",
    "for the estimate of the @xmath37s we have corrected the photons arrival times with eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr ] ) , adopting the estimate of @xmath21 and @xmath104 given by cm98 .",
    "this seemed appropriate since we have demonstrated that , adopting the value of @xmath105 and @xmath106 reported by cm98 , the leading term in @xmath31 depends only on @xmath107 .",
    "however , at the end of our analysis , we found that our best - fit orbital period is incompatible with that reported in cm98 , and this explains why the use of the ephemeris published in cm98 allows to recover the coherent pulsations only during the 1998 outburst .",
    "we want to stress that a test of the correctness of our orbital solution is given by the fact that with our revised orbital parameters we can recover the pulsations in all the observations between 1998 and 2002 .",
    "we also found a @xmath108 ( at @xmath109 confidence level ) which means that in principle its effects on orbital parameters during @xmath110 yr must be discussed . indeed the orbital period has varied and , because of the three outburst that occurred during @xmath27 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 varied as a consequence of mass transfer .",
    "both these variations produce , because of third kepler s law , a variation of the orbital separation along @xmath27 which reflects in a secular variation of @xmath113 .",
    "we therefore checked _ a posteriori _ that both the secular variation of @xmath113 and @xmath21 did not affect our determination of the orbital parameters of the system . by differentiating @xmath114 and the third kepler s law ( assuming that the inclination angle has remained constant )",
    ", we have demonstrated that the uncertainties on @xmath21 and @xmath113 in the 2002 outburst are always dominated by the uncertainties in their original determination as given by cm98 .",
    "in particular we obtain that the uncertainty on @xmath113 induced by mass transfer is of the order of @xmath115 times the uncertainty reported by cm98 , as soon as the orbital period derivative is @xmath116 , the number of orbital cycles elapsed since the 1998 outburst is @xmath117 , and the averaged mass loss rate by the secondary during the whole period @xmath27 is not much greater than the average mass transfer rate during the three outbursts , which is @xmath118 ( as can be easily determined from an analysis of the x - ray luminosity during the 1998 , 2000 , and 2002 outbursts ) , where @xmath119 is the source distance in units of 2.5 kpc and @xmath120 is the ns radius in units of @xmath121 cm . therefore , our assumption of using @xmath76 and @xmath21 as given by cm98 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr ] ) is justified _ a posteriori _ , since their associated uncertainties , even taking into account the effects of orbital evolution , are always comparable with those estimated by cm98 .    the improved estimate of @xmath21 derived in this paper ( whose associated error , @xmath105 , is 10 times smaller than that reported by cm98 ) allowed us to correct a lightcurve using eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr ] ) with the improved value of the orbital period @xmath99 and the predicted value of @xmath37 resulting from @xmath122 .",
    "as discussed in the fourth paragraph of  2 , folding this lightcurve modulo @xmath47 for any time interval @xmath123 introduces delays in the reconstruction of the pulse profile up to @xmath124 ( since @xmath125 is a periodic function of period @xmath126 and average value @xmath127 ) . adopting our new estimate of @xmath105",
    "we get @xmath128 for the 2002 data . which means that if the number of bins in the pulse profile is up to few tens , we do not expect a significant distortion because of the uncertainties in the orbital parameters . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we compare two pulse profiles obtained by folding modulo @xmath47 ( the cm98 estimate ) @xmath129 and @xmath61 hours of data of the 1998 and 2002 outbursts , respectively , corrected with eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr ] ) .",
    "it is evident that the 2002 pulse profile has significantly varied with respect to the almost sinusoidal shape showed in the 1998 outburst ; in particular we find a secondary peak at about @xmath4 from the main pulse .",
    "this variability of the pulse profile suggests that strong caution should be taken in carrying out the standard pulse timing analysis when computing the delays of the time of arrival of a pulse by cross - correlating the locally folded pulse profile with a sinusoid , as done in cm98 .",
    "temporary variations of the pulse shape could introduce spurious delays that may significantly affect the robustness of some derived parameters e.g.  the local spin period derivative .",
    "in our analysis we found @xmath2 s s@xmath3 ( 90% c.l . ) .",
    "indeed , orbital evolution calculations show that the magnitude of the @xmath36 caused by angular momentum losses associated with the emission of gravitational radiation is expected to be one order of magnitude smaller , @xmath130 s s@xmath3 , where we assumed a mass  radius relation for the secondary @xmath131 , and @xmath132 is the orbital period in units of 2 hours",
    ". however the error in the estimate of @xmath36 scales as @xmath133 .",
    "this means that if , as expected , the next outburst of will occur in 2005 , we will reduce @xmath134 by a factor @xmath135 .",
    "this new measure could severely constraint some of the evolutionary scenario proposed : for instance , the degenerate nature of the companion ( that has been proposed to be a brown dwarf by bildsten & chakrabarty 2001 ) will be effectively probed , since @xmath136 , as expected for a degenerate companion , would imply @xmath137 .",
