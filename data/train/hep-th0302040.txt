    "in 70-th the notion of superspace is introduced in quantum field theory to make supersymmetry possible .",
    "in addition to the usual dimensions ( coordinates ) @xmath0 , spinor fermionic ( anticommuting ) dimensions of space - time are introduced .",
    "if supersymmetry is indeed discovered in the next generation of experiments at fermilab and cern within a decade or two ( see the review paper @xcite ) , this will amount to the discovery of the new dimensions .",
    "there is another general problem in which the existence of additional spinor coordinates of space - time plays an important role . in 1952 ,",
    "wick , wightman , and wigner @xcite show that the coherent superpositions of states with even and odd numbers of fermions are incompatible with the lorenz invariance and introduce the superselection rule , according to which such superpositions are physically impossible .",
    "in actuality ( as is pointed out in @xcite ) , the superselection rule is the alternative to the existence of additional spinor coordinates .",
    "the point is that the vector @xmath1  of any state with an odd number of fermions , being spinor of the odd rank , is multiplied by @xmath2 upon the rotations @xmath3 of the coordinate system through an angle of @xmath4 about any axis and upon the double time reversal @xmath5 .",
    "the vectors @xmath6   of the states with an even number of fermions do not change under the @xmath3 and @xmath5 transformations .",
    "for this reason , the existence of a coherent superposition    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are nonzero complex numbers , @xmath10 , implies the existence of a strange state @xmath11 which changes physically under the @xmath3 and @xmath5 transformations , because the corresponding change of the state vector does not amount to the appearance of a common phase factor .",
    "if @xmath0 completely characterize the space - time , then the @xmath3 and @xmath5 transformations coincide with the identical transformation , which can change nothing physically .",
    "the superselection rule is necessary in this case .",
    "if , in addition to @xmath0 , the spinor coordinates exist , @xmath3 and @xmath5 are physically real transformations changing the sign of the additional coordinates . in this case , the superselection rule is not necessary .",
    "thus , the proof of the possible existence of states @xmath11 corresponding to the coherent superpositions of states with even and odd numbers of fermions is simultaneously the proof of the reality of a superspace with additional spinor dimensions .",
    "such proof is presented below .",
    "namely , we show that states @xmath12 can be realized in a simple system with variable number of electrons which form , together with an environment , an isolated common system with a fixed number of electrons . in the case",
    "considered , the interaction of the system with the environment can be described as an external field acting on the system .",
    "this field has the spinor character ; i.e. , it changes sign under the @xmath3 and @xmath5 transformations .",
    "all eigenstates of the hamiltonian of the system are coherent superpositions @xmath13 of the states with even and odd numbers of electrons , so at temperatures well below the characteristic energy difference , one ( ground ) of the states is automatically realized .    irrespective of whether supersymmetry really exists or not , the existence of additional dimensions of space - time results in the existence of corresponding universal degrees of freedom for systems of fermions .",
    "below , the nature of these degrees of freedom is elucidated for nonrelativistic systems .",
    "we show that they correspond to the continuous change of the number of fermions in the system . in principle , there are two ways to change the average number @xmath14 of fermions continuously between two neighboring integral values @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the states with nonintegral @xmath14 can be either impure states corresponding to incoherent mixtures of states @xmath15 and @xmath16 , or pure states @xmath11 considered above",
    ". the first possibility would be the only one if the superselection rule is valid .",
    "we show that the change of @xmath14 in a system from @xmath15 to @xmath16 through coherent superpositions @xmath13 can be ( and should be ) interpreted as `` the motion '' of the system `` as a whole '' along the additional fermionic dimensions of space - time . since the coherent change of @xmath14 is accompanied by the change of the spin of the system ,",
    "the considered universal degrees of freedom include also the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "we consider condensed matter systems such as metallic nanoparticles influenced by gate potentials at extremely low temperatures .",
    "the nanoparticles behave like mesoscopic quantum dots ( mqd ) , i.e. , all ordinary spatial degrees of freedom of the particles are completely frozen out . near some critical values of the gate potentials ,",
    "the particles possess electronic degrees of freedom which are not still frozen and which are described adequate in terms of the additional space - time coordinates .",
    "we suggest experiments with mqds which generalize the experiment of nakamura et al .",
    "@xcite on the observation of quantum coherence between the states with different ( but even in both cases ) numbers of electrons .",
    "the implementation of these experiments will directly demonstrate the coherence between the states with even and odd numbers of electrons and , thereby , justify the reality of the new dimensions .",
    "we are going to demonstrate that the superselection rule is not selfconsistent .",
    "we show that states @xmath11 can be naturally realized in a simple realistic system with variable number of electrons because this system is governed by the hamiltonian whose eigenstates are all coherent superpositions of the states with even and odd numbers of electrons .",
    "the idea ( see @xcite ) is as follows .",
    "the number of electrons is a conserved quantity which is analogous , in this respect , to the momentum .",
    "physical systems with hamiltonians whose eigenstates are all coherent superpositions of the states with different momenta are well known .",
    "a particle in an external potential field depending on the particle coordinate is the simplest example .",
    "in actuality , this particle is part of an isolated system consisting of the particle and a certain massive body , the interaction with which can be described as an external field acting on the particle . as known , this is justified only if certain conditions are fulfilled .",
    "first , the states of a massive body must adiabatically adjust to the changes in the particle coordinate in order to prevent excitation of the body degrees of freedom .",
    "second , all measurements must be made only with the particle .",
    "no direct influence upon a massive body is possible .",
    "let us consider single electron with fixed spin projection ( strong external magnetic field is applied along @xmath17-axis ) which can be localized in one of two quantum dots ( i and ii ) and can tunnel from one dot to another .",
    "we are going to consider everything inside the dot i as system with variable number of electrons we are investigating ( analogous to the particle in the above example ) and everything inside the dot ii as environment ( analogous to a massive body ) .",
    "this can be done by the following two steps .",
    "first , we consider our initial system ( single electron ) as a part of a larger system with variable number of electrons consisting of both quantum dots whose hilbert space @xmath18 ( see fig.1 ) corresponds to the general superposition @xmath19 of all states @xmath20 with the numbers of electrons @xmath21 in the dot i and @xmath22 in the dot ii running through values @xmath23 independently .",
    "let us introduce in @xmath18 the operators @xmath24 and @xmath25 of annihilation and creation of electrons in the dot i and the dot ii , respectively , so @xmath26 and @xmath27 .     into the hilbert space @xmath28    the hilbert space @xmath29 of our initial system ( the straight line @xmath30 in fig.1 ) corresponds to the general superposition @xmath31 of states @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the characteristic feature of the space @xmath29 is that the quantum number @xmath22 of the environment is determined unambiguously by the quantum number @xmath21 of the system :    @xmath34    here the sign @xmath35 means , as in the book of dirac @xcite , that the corresponding equality is the following auxiliary condition on the state vector    @xmath36    but not an operator identity in the whole space @xmath18 .",
    "it is this property that allows the interaction of the system with the environment to be treated as an external field acting on the system .",
    "this is a fermionic analogy to the adiabatic condition in the above example .",
    "the second step is to project the hilbert space @xmath29 of the system into the hilbert space @xmath37 ( the straight line @xmath38 in fig.1 ) of the dot i considered as a separate system .",
    "the corresponding state vectors @xmath39 are superpositions of states @xmath40 and @xmath41 . the projection is the result of the transformation @xmath42 of state vectors in the space @xmath18 with    @xmath43    where @xmath44 .",
    "we have    @xmath45    the operator @xmath46 is not unitary in @xmath18 :    @xmath47    but in @xmath29 , it satisfies the condition    @xmath48    because    @xmath49    the condition ( [ m ] ) gives the possibility to introduce the transformed hermitian operator    @xmath50    acting in @xmath51 for each hermitian operator @xmath52 acting in @xmath29 in such a way that the matrix elements do not change .",
    "in fact , let    @xmath53    be two states in @xmath51 corresponding to two arbitrary states @xmath54 and @xmath55 in @xmath29 . according to ( [ eq10 ] ) , ( [ eq9 ] ) , and ( [ m ] ) we have    @xmath56    the hamiltonian of single electron",
    "can be represented in @xmath29 as    @xmath57    where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are energies when electron is localized in the dot i and the dot ii , respectively , @xmath60 is the tunneling amplitude .",
    "after simple calculations , we find quantities transformed to @xmath37 :    @xmath61    @xmath62    @xmath63    where the condition @xmath64 in @xmath37 is used .    finally , the hamiltonian of the system interacting with the environment is    @xmath65    where @xmath66 .",
    "we note that @xmath67 does not contain operators @xmath68 and @xmath69 of the environment .",
    "the interaction of the system with the environment is described as an external field @xmath70 acting on the system .",
    "the field @xmath70 , as well as the operators @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and other spinor quantities , change sign under the @xmath3 and @xmath5 transformations so that , for a given field value , hamiltonian ( [ eq16 ] ) is not invariant about these transformations . due to the presence of terms linear in electron operators , all eigenstates of the hamiltonian are coherent superpositions of the states with even and odd numbers of electrons",
    "actually , ( [ eq16 ] ) is the hamiltonian of the two level system @xmath73",
    "thus , to describe the above system correctly , we have to introduce additional spinor dimensions of space - time . assuming that the corresponding coordinates are the nonrelativistic limit of the coordinates considered in the field theory , we introduce ( as in @xcite,@xcite ) a pauli spinor @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a spin index .",
    "additional coordinates @xmath74 are grassmann coordinates satisfying anticommutation relations    @xmath76    whatever the actual superspace structure is in the relativistic case , this simplest possibility is quite general in the nonrelativistic limit .    in the case considered above due to the presence of the strong magnetic field along @xmath17-axis , the system ( the dot i )",
    "should be treated as `` moving '' along @xmath77 .",
    "quantum mechanics with anticommuting coordinates is well known ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the `` wave function '' @xmath78 is an analitical function of @xmath79 . due to the condition @xmath80 , the most general @xmath81 is    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the unit of grassmann algebra . by identifying @xmath84 and @xmath85",
    "we see that states @xmath11 in ( [ eq17 ] ) are identical to ( [ eq010 ] ) .",
    "the physical change of states @xmath11 under the @xmath3 and @xmath5 transformations is connected with the spinor nature of the physical coordinate @xmath79 .",
    "operators @xmath72 and @xmath71 in the hamiltonian ( [ eq16 ] ) play the role of canonical coordinate @xmath86 and momentum @xmath87 corresponding to the additional dimension of space - time .",
    "to elucidate the physical meaning of the degrees of freedom corresponding to the additional dimensions , it is very helpful to consider ground states of a mesoscopic quantum dot at different values of the gate potential or at different values of the electron chemical potential .",
    "we consider a metal particle with a large but finite number @xmath15 of electrons , connected by tunnel junctions to macroscopic leads and ( or ) to other particles of the same type , and being influenced by a gate potential .",
    "let us suppose that the temperature and all tunneling amplitudes are much smaller than the energy difference @xmath88 between the first excited and ground states of the particle at a given number of electrons , @xmath89 is fermi energy . under these conditions the metal particle behaves as a mesoscopic quantum dot ( mqd ) , i.e.",
    ", it is a quasi - closed system in which all ordinary degrees of freedom associated with spatial motion of electrons are completely frozen . inasmuch as even at lowest experimentally possible temperature @xmath90 the number of electrons can not be larger than @xmath91",
    ", we have to deal with metallic nanoparticles of the type obtained by ralph et al.@xcite .",
    "thus , at a given @xmath15 the metal particle is in its ground state @xmath92 with the energy @xmath93 .",
    "minimization of @xmath94 with respect to @xmath15 at a given gate potential @xmath46 determines the ground state value of @xmath95 .",
    "we see that in mqd , a change in the number of electrons accompanying a change of the gate potential occurs as a result of first - order phase transitions between phases characterized by different integral values of @xmath15 ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the jumps of the number of electrons occur at critical values of the gate potential .     vs gate potential @xmath46 at fixed @xmath96    it is important here to take into account the so - called parity effect , i.e. the fact that in fermi systems , the ground state energy @xmath93 calculated with an accuracy appropriate for a mesoscopic system contains in an explicit form the number of particles in the combination @xmath97 . in order to deal only with quasi - continuous functions at large @xmath15",
    ", we should introduce two different functions @xmath98 and @xmath99 , individually for odd and even values of @xmath15 , extrapolated to the same value of @xmath15 .",
    "the difference @xmath100 , which is usually positive , can be considered as a quantitative characteristics of the parity effect . due to the parity effect ,",
    "the steps correspondong to even @xmath15 are longer than the steps corresponding to odd @xmath15 .",
    "( see fig.2 ) .",
    "with increasing @xmath101 the length of even steps increases , while the length of odd steps decreases until the odd steps disappear at all .",
    "the jumps of the number of electrons at critical values of the gate potential become equal to 2 .",
    "the phase transitions between states with neighboring even numbers of electrons take place at large @xmath101 .",
    "a clear example of a system characterized by large @xmath101 is the so - called single - cooper - pair box ( see @xcite ) , i.e. a superconducting mqd in which all electrons form cooper - pairs and the energy of an additional single electron ( the superconducting energy gap ) is very large .    to classify all possible ground states of a _",
    "normal _ mqd at different values of the gate potential , let us put @xmath102 where the quasicontinuous number @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ! ) runs through all even numbers , while @xmath105 .",
    "there are three states for each @xmath106 with @xmath107 , respectively , the combinations ( @xmath108 ) and ( @xmath109 ) being identical .",
    "fig.2 shows the dependence @xmath110 at a given @xmath106 .",
    "there are two critical values of the gate potential , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , corresponding to the conditions    @xmath113    and    @xmath114    respectively , where @xmath115 .    as the parity effect increases ( with changing @xmath106 ) , the quantities @xmath116 and @xmath117 approach one another , so that for certain @xmath118 ( or @xmath119 ) determined by the equation    @xmath120    a triple point may exist where all three states have the same energy .",
    "we note that the triple point has actually been observed experimentally @xcite .    for an even larger @xmath101 ( @xmath121 )",
    "there is only one critical value , @xmath122 , where    @xmath123    the jump of @xmath15 at @xmath124 is equal to 2 .    at critical values of the gate potential ,",
    "the ground state is degenerate .",
    "according to the quantum superposition principle ( no superselection rule ! ) , there are infinite sets of ground states of the form    @xmath125    @xmath126    and    @xmath127    at @xmath128 and @xmath129 for @xmath130 , and at @xmath124 for @xmath131 , respectively , where @xmath132 .",
    "the ground states of the form ( [ * ] ) , ( [ * * ] ) , and ( [ e ] ) are characterized by nonintegral averaged numbers of electrons @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "one can say that these states correspond to `` phase coexistence '' regions ( vertical segments in fig.2 ) of first - order phase transitions taking place at @xmath128 , @xmath117 , and @xmath134 .",
    "the `` phase coexistence '' of all three phases with @xmath135 ,    @xmath136    takes place at the triple point @xmath137 .",
    "these ground states are characterized by two physical ( superconducting ! , see @xcite ) phases , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , and @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 .",
    "a more general consideration is the following . near critical values @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath134 of the gate potential",
    "the mqd has some number of states which are close in energy to the ground state .",
    "all other states have a much higher energy and can be neglected in low - frequency dynamics . in this sense",
    "one can say that the mqd possesses degrees of freedom active at low temperatures and low frequencies ( much below @xmath143 ) .",
    "active degrees of freedom are characterized by the hilbert spaces ( [ * ] ) , ( [ * * ] ) , ( [ e ] ) , or ( [ t ] ) near @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath134 , or near the triple point , respectively .    to take spin into account ,",
    "let us suppose that the state @xmath144 and the state @xmath145 are spin - singlets , and the state with @xmath146 has a total spin 1/2 .",
    "otherwise these states are `` incompletely frozen '' with respect to the bose degrees of freedom",
    ". then in the most general case ( realized near the triple point ) , four states , @xmath144 , @xmath147 , and @xmath145 where @xmath75 is a spin index , are close in energy .",
    "the hilbert space of active degrees of freedom corresponds to the general superposition    @xmath148    where @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 are complex numbers .",
    "active degrees of freedom near @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath134 , far from the triple point are described by ( [ g ] ) with @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 , respectively .",
    "let us show that the active degrees of freedom described by ( [ g ] ) correspond to `` motion '' of the mqd along the spinor dimensions @xmath74 of superspace .",
    "due to the anticommutation relations ( [ a ] ) , the most general wave function @xmath155 of the mqd is    @xmath156    by identifying @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 , we see that the hilbert space ( [ g ] ) is identical to ( [ s ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the mqd is expressed in terms of the coordinates @xmath160 and momenta @xmath161 operators satisfying the canonical relations for fermi operators .",
    "the operators @xmath162 and @xmath163 represent universal collective characteristics of any system of fermions under conditions such that the bose degrees of freedom are completely frozen . in exactly the same manner ,",
    "the conventional coordinate and momentum operators describe the dynamics of a system with respect to a collective bose degree of freedom under conditions such that all other degrees of freedom are frozen .",
    "the mqd is characterized by the following gauge invariant quantities @xmath164 where @xmath165 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the operator @xmath21 corresponds to the parameter @xmath21 introduced above . the operator @xmath166 is the operator of the total spin of the mqd .",
    "the operators @xmath162 and @xmath163 are therefore a generalization of the spin operators to the case where , together with @xmath0 , there exist additional dimensions described by @xmath74 .",
    "the states ( [ * ] ) , ( [ e ] ) , and generally ( [ g ] ) are the stationary states of the mqd at critical values of the gate potential when the interaction of the mqd with the environment or with other mqds is neglected . manipulating by the gate potentials as functions of time in a system of two ( or more ) mqds one can realize conditions when even infinitesimal tunneling amplitudes cause observable tunneling transitions of electrons between different mqds .",
    "this happens at the moments when the energies of different states of the total system coincide , the states ( [ * ] ) , ( [ e ] ) , and ( [ g ] ) playing the role of asymptotic states . the coherence of these states can be demonstrated by observations of interference phenomena ( see @xcite and below ) .",
    "it is important to note that due to the relatively large dimensions of mqds one can measure the charge of a mqd without essential disturbance of neighbouring mqds .",
    "this can be done ( as in the experiment of nakamura et al .",
    "@xcite ) using a probe electrode connected to the mqd under study through a tunneling contact or ( as in the experiment of aassime et al .",
    "@xcite ) using a probe electrometer based on a single - electron transistor .",
    "let us consider the simplest experimental situation .",
    "the role of quantum dots ( the dots i and ii ) in the discussion of section ii can be played by two mqds . the gate potentials should be close to corresponding critical values @xmath116 for both mqds .",
    "the sum of the parameters @xmath21 ( determined by ( [ o ] ) ) should be equal to one . under these conditions",
    "the tunneling of the additional ( with reference to the state with both @xmath21 equal to zero ) single electron between mqd i ( considered as a system ) and mqd ii ( considered as environment ) is the only active degree of freedom .",
    "all other degrees of freedom correspond to much higher energies and can be neglected .",
    "thus , to prove experimentally the existence of the new dimensions of space - time , one has to demonstrate the coherence of the superpositions ( [ eq17 ] ) for the two level system ( mqd i ) governed by the hamiltonian ( [ eq16 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding time - dependent schroedinger equations are        the system considered by nakamura et al .",
    "@xcite to demonstrate the coherence between states with different , but even in both cases , numbers of electrons is also equivalent to a two level system described by the equations ( [ sch ] ) . in the case considered by nakamura et al .",
    "the role of the system ( mqd i ) , the environment ( mqd ii ) , and the spinor field @xmath70 are played by a single - cooper - pair box , a macroscopic superconductor ( cooper - pair reservoir ) , and by the josephson coupling constant , respectively .    below we consider two experiments .",
    "the first experiment is the experiment of nakamura et al .",
    "performed with our two - level system ( [ sch ] ) . before the initial time ( @xmath170 ) , the two - level system has been in the ground state with the gate potential of the mqd i such that @xmath171 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath172 and @xmath173 . at @xmath170 ,",
    "the gate potential rapidly changes to a value for which @xmath174 .",
    "then , the potential remains constant for a time @xmath175 , after which it rapidly regains its initial value . on the time interval between @xmath170 and @xmath176 ,",
    "the system obeys eqs.[sch ] with @xmath174 and initial conditions @xmath177 and @xmath178",
    ". then @xmath179 and @xmath180 . at @xmath181 ,",
    "one measures the everage charge of the system      as a function of pulse duration @xmath175 .",

    ", the system considered is an oscillator moving along the fermionic coordinate @xmath186 .",
    "the nakamura - type experiment considered above can be modified by passing from the single - pulse to two - pulse technique .",
    "as above , let the two - level system be at @xmath187 in the ground state @xmath188 and @xmath189 , @xmath171 .",
    "the amplitude of the first gate - potential rectangular pulse is the same as above ( i.e. , corresponds to @xmath174 ) , but its duration is fixed at @xmath190 . immediately after the pulse at @xmath191 ,",
