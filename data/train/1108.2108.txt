    "the degree of bias control is moderated for increasing defect concentrations .",
    "however , our averaging procedure may exaggerate this reduction since it corresponds to a physical situation where , in plane , there is a coexistence of ( uncorrelated ) ferromagnetic and non  ferromagnetic domains .",
    "if on the other hand , in  plane ferromagnetic order is established or destroyed coherently ( in correlated fashion ) , the degree of bias control is underestimated by our sampling procedure .",
    "this makes us suggest to perform spin  sensitive tunneling spectroscopy , ideally in presence of an external magnetic field , since the current spin polarization is predicted to be a more sensitive signature to determine the degree of ferromagnetic order in the sample than resonances in the i  v curve .",
    "in fact the latter are predicted to occur at a bias when the sample is in the nonmagnetic state only .    to illustrate the changes in the magnetic state of the quantum well near the first current peak at @xmath92  v , we plot the local density of states ( ldos ) closely below resonance ( @xmath93  v , fig .",

    "this maintains hole spin polarization , however , it decreases with increasing bias , leading to a continuous decrease in @xmath95 shown in fig .",

    "while hole spin polarization decreases , hole density increases in the well region partially screening the applied bias . as the applied bias is increased resonance is reached .",

    "fermi level and ferromagnetic order collapses , as shown in fig .",

    "both subbands are equally flooded from both contacts leading to an unpolarized hole gas in the well and , hence , to a destruction of ferromagnetic order .",
    "note the change in the effective potential profile in the well from convex up in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldos0 ] to almost linear in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldos1 ] . if the bias is increased further the levels are pushed closely below the emitter valence band edge and resonance to the emitter is suppressed .",
    "however , any small perturbation triggers the system into a ferromagnetic state , in which the spin up level preferrentially is filled from the collector side ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ldos2 ] ) .",
    "thus , inspection of the ldos - plots shows that the ferromagnetic state in the quantum well is determined by the relative position of the well subband edges and the contact quasi  fermi levels .",
    "an appropriate tailoring of these levels allows to change the hole gas polarization under bias and thereby provides electrical control of the ferromagnetic state in the well . in our case",
    "we consider only a two  terminal configuration with source and drain contacts but the use of additional gates in transverse direction ( multi  terminal configurations ) provides an additional control knob to move the subbands .",
    "although these structures are very difficult to realize in practice , they have been studied in a recent experiment @xcite .",
    "the change of the magnetic state in the well is directly reflected in the ( collector ) current spin polarization , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pj ] .",
    "if the entire quantum well becomes nonmagnetic , the spin density in the well vanishes and the collector current becomes unpolarized .",
    "a polarized current indicates exchange  split subbands in the well , demonstrating ferromagnetism in the well .",
    "the experimental probing of the current spin polarization at the collector side therefore would give important additional information to confirm the interpretation of recent experiments regarding size quantization effects in gamnas quantum wells @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have used a steady  state transport model to investigate the role of structural disorder on the interplay of ferromagnetic order and resonant tunneling in double barrier structures with a gamnas quantum well .",
    "ferromagnetic exchange , as well as the hole coulomb interaction are treated within a self  consistent mean  field approximation .",
    "disorder effects are modeled by random variation of onsite and hopping matrix elements of the tight - binding hamiltonian according to basic experimental findings on the mn@xmath4 acceptor . in this work",
    "we have modeled an electronic structure with an isolated impurity band , as supported by most of the recent experiments .    for samples which , at zero bias , exhibit ferromagnetic order in the gaasmn well we predict that ferromagnetic order is destroyed under bias near ( the first heavy - hole ) resonance .",
    "while at resonance the well region is flooded by holes these are overall _ unpolarized _ thus prohibiting the communication of ferromagnetic ordering amongst mn@xmath4 sites in the well . within our model",
    "we thus are able to provide a possible explanation for the absence of exchange splitting near resonances , as observed in recent tunneling spectroscopy measurements on thin gamnas layers @xcite .",
    "furthermore we find that an experimental investigation of the spin polarization of the collector current can give information about the presence of magnetism in the quantum well .",
    "such a measurement is more revealing regarding the ferromagnetic state than the search for resonances in the i  v curve , since the former is more robust against disorder than the latter .",
    "we find that disorder tends to suppress negative differential resistance region in the iv - curve .",
    "although our model is merely qualitative it indicates that substitution disorder from mn doping alone is not sufficient to explain the absence negative differential conductivity in experiment .",
    "there are a number of open question which should be addressed in the future .",
    "one pertains to the correlation length of ferromagnetic order parallel to the heterointerface .",
    "it has direct influence on the spin  valve action and its bias  control of ferromagnetic heterostructures .",
    "furthermore , one may ask to what extent magneto  transport experiments can distinguish between the two main electronic structure models ( with and without isolated impurity band ) discussed in the literature .",
