    "rare and short - lived radio isotopes are of interest because of their nuclear properties . they offer unique possibilities for investigating fundamental physical symmetries , for applied physics , and for nuclear structure studies @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for investigating fundamental symmetries is to improve limits for the validity of the standard model , which can be inferred from high - precision measurements .",
    "such low energy experiments are complementary to searches for new physics in high - energy physics experiments . in particular , high accuracy can be achieved , when suitable radioactive isotopes can be cooled and stored in atom or ion traps @xcite .    with this aim the tri@xmath0p ( trapped radioactive isotopes : @xmath0icrolaboratories for fundamental physics ) facility at the kernfysisch versneller instituut(kvi ) in groningen , the netherlands , was proposed and funded in order to provide a state of the art user facility for such high - precision studies @xcite . while the magnetic separator of tri@xmath0p is the main topic of this article , we will briefly describe the complete facility consisting of several major subsystems in order to put the use of the separator into perspective .",
    "a heavy - ion beam with a maximum magnetic rigidity of 3.6 tm from the superconducting cyclotron agor @xcite is used to produce a variety of short - lived isotopes using very different reaction mechanisms , such as fragmentation , charge - exchange reactions and fusion - evaporation .",
    "primary beams ranging from protons to lead are available . in order to direct most of the reaction products into a relatively narrow forward - angle cone , the technique of inverse kinematics is used .",
    "this applies e.g. to charge - exchange reactions on a gaseous hydrogen target and fusion - evaporation on light - element solid targets .",
    "the maximum available beam energy is about 95 mev / nucleon for fully stripped , lighter heavy ions ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the energy of heavy ions is restricted by the maximum charge state that can be reached with the ion source of the cyclotron .",
    "the heaviest ion accelerated with agor was @xmath3pb with an energy of 8.4 mev / nucleon . in the various reactions , the beam and the reaction products travel together in a narrow cone in forward direction with the emittance of the products typically much larger than the beam emittance .",
    "the products and beam need to be separated efficiently , as will be described later .    at the exit of the separator , the produced isotopes have a considerable momentum corresponding to a maximum magnetic rigidity of about 3.0 tm . here",
    ", particles can already be stopped and measured in e.g. si detectors to measure certain properties . for the program on fundamental physics a low - energy secondary beam must be produced .",
    "for this the particles will first be slowed in a degrader and stopped in a gas - filled ion catcher or a thermal ionizer .",
    "they will be extracted as singly charged ions and guided into a low pressure he - filled rfq - cooler buncher system and trapped in the last stage of the rfq , which functions as a paul trap .",
    "this will allow to produce a low energy bunched beam with a sufficiently small emittance and an energy of a few kev .",
    "this beam can be guided to one of several experimental setups .",
    "one of these is a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) assembly , where the actual measurements will take place .",
    "the primary goal governing the design concept and the ion optics was to achieve an optimal separation of the wanted isotopes from other reaction products and the primary beam .",
    "clearly two different types of reactions are foreseen .",
    "one involving the production of fast light isotopes from fragmentation or charge - exchange reactions , the other the production of slow heavy isotopes in fusion - evaporation reactions .",
    "the magnetic separator was designed to allow two modes , which we will refer to as the `` _ fragmentation mode _ '' and the `` _ gas - filled mode _ '' for the two types of reactions , respectively .",
    "in the first mode , fully stripped reaction products can be separated ; in the second mode the charge - state distribution of partly stripped reaction products can be collapsed dynamically onto a single effective charge state with a suitable gas filling .",
    "at the start of the design of the magnetic separator a list of criteria was established to develop a concept for the separator and to specify the design parameters .    1 .",
    "production of a range of short - lived light ( e.g. @xmath1na ) to heavy radio isotopes ( e.g. @xmath4ra ) , using heavy - ion beams from the agor cyclotron .",

    "for further details see text . ]    based on these considerations the combined magnetic separator with the layout shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : layout ] was designed .",
    "it is based on concepts used in previous magnetic fragment @xcite and gas - filled @xcite separators .",
    "it is a special feature of the tri@xmath0p separator to combine both concepts in one single device so that it can operate in either the _ fragmentation mode _ or the _ gas - filled mode_. the main design parameters are summarized in table [ design parameters ] .",
    ".design parameters of the tri@xmath0p magnetic separator .",

    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : q ] for the quadrupole doublet q6 , q7 .",
    "all quadrupole magnets were mapped and tested at the factory and delivered including the vacuum chambers and supports . as in the case of the dipole magnets ,",
    "most of the electrical specifications were determined to allow the use of existing power supplies except for two power supplies that had to be purchased .",
    "for the proper setup , optimization and operation of the separator a series of diagnostic elements is needed .",
    "a variety of devices are required to tune and stop the beam , in addition standard si solid state detectors were used in the intermediate and focal plane to observe the fragments .",
    "some of the instrumentation is discussed below .",
    "the target chambers t1 or t2 and the vacuum chamber between b1 and b2 are equipped with retractable harps .",
    "the harps consist of 24 wires that are stretched in horizontal and vertical directions with 1 mm or 2 mm spacing .",
    "signals from the wires are individually read out and visualized as a beam profile in vertical and horizontal directions .",
    "the harps are standard equipment for beam tuning in the beam lines @xcite .",
    "they can be operated to tune with the full beam and viewed simultaneously in the setup phase of an experiment . in t1 and t2 target ladders",
    "are used with scintillating targets , they can be viewed by means of ccd cameras through plexiglass ports .",
    "the lifetime of these viewing targets ( zn@xmath7sio@xmath8 on al foil ) is limited .",
    "they are mostly used for the final tuning .",
    "both snapshots of the harp data and viewing targets can be stored for reference . in the commissioning phase",
    "scintillating screens were also used on a movable platform in a focal - plane chamber t3 .    in anticipation of high beam currents",
    ", the beam stops in front of t1 and t2 have been designed to allow water cooling . when tuning for fragments the beam is stopped on one of the slits located at sh2 , sh3 , or sh4 for the _ fragmentation mode _ and sh5 or sh6 for the _ gas - filled mode_.    at present there are three pairs of horizontally movable slits that are remotely controlled and",
    "can be installed at any of the mentioned locations depending on the requirements of the experiment .",
    "the movable slits are also used to verify the ion optics , e.g. focus conditions in conjunction with the beam or other setup conditions .      in order to optimize the separator for transport and focusing of the desired reaction products at the exit of the separator ,",
    "it is important to have online particle identification .",
    "while the optimal detection system depends on particle type , we have used a 100 @xmath0 m thick si detector with a diameter of 20 mm that provided either energy e or energy loss @xmath9e and a timing signal . as we will see below ,",
    "this detection is well suited for identifying light to medium - mass particles .",
    "one detector is permanently mounted on a movable arm ( horizontal plane ) in t2 . during the initial tests and development runs ,",
    "a second si detector was mounted on a movable table at the focal plane t3 .",
    "the _ fragmentation mode _ has been tested with the @xmath10h(@xmath1ne , @xmath1na)n reaction . for initial tests with low beam intensities ,",
    "thin polyethylene foils as hydrogen targets were used , with carbon as the only other target component .",
    "the hydrogen content of these targets , however , will diminish rapidly with higher ionization density , i.e. when the beam current is increased or for low energy and/or heavy element beams .    for higher beam currents ,",
    "a hydrogen - filled gas target is used .",
    "this target has 2.5 @xmath0 m havar foils as windows following a design of a target in use at texas a&m @xcite . in order to increase the density by about a factor of 4 , the gas cell is cooled down to liquid nitrogen temperature .",
    "the gas cell is approximately 10 cm long with windows of 1.25 cm diameter .",
    "it can be moved vertically to allow insertion of a target ladder at the object position in t1 .",
    "the gas target and its accessories were designed and produced at north carolina state university @xcite .      in _ fragmentation mode",
    "_ , the separator _ section 1 _ provides a dispersive focal plane , where the beam - if not stopped previously - and other undesirable products can be separated by momentum selection using horizontal slits . the design momentum acceptance of @xmath11 2@xmath12 translates in a 16 cm wide focal plane due to the momentum dispersion of about 4 cm/@xmath12 .",
    "section 2 _ reverses the effect of the dispersive function of _ section 1 _ and provides an achromatic beam spot of the order of 20 mm diameter , well suited to be accepted in a following ion catcher .",
    "however , all particles , including the undesirable ones , that pass through the momentum slits will also enter the ion catcher .",
    "for further separation a degrader can be used .",
    "such a degrader will provide mass selection , because of the differences in energy loss .",
    "because of the momentum acceptance of @xmath11 2@xmath12 also the desired products will be dispersed , effectively disturbing the achromaticity .",
    "this effect can be eliminated by changing the thickness of the degrader along the dispersive plane .",
    "such a degrader is called a `` wedge '' and can be realized by bending a foil of constant thickness .",
    "a holder for bent foils with dimensions corresponding to the intermediate plane was made .",
    "in november 2003 the modifications of shielding and the installation of power and utility lines in the designated tri@xmath0p separator hall ( t - cell ) was completed . at this time all major components , in particular the magnets and their support , had been delivered .",
    "only two additional power supplies had to be purchased as most of the magnets were designed to be able to use existing power supplies not operated at the same time as the tri@xmath0p separator .",
    "installation of the separator itself started in december 2003 and was completed in april 2004 followed by commissioning runs in may 2004 .",

    "this beam was transmitted into the dispersive focal plane at t2 where it had dimensions of 5 mm by 8 mm in the horizontal and vertical directions .",
    "the beam was subsequently put onto a viewer at t3 , where the achromatic image size was approximately 10 mm by 10 mm in both transverse directions . in order to verify the momentum dispersion and to obtain information about the momentum acceptance , copper foils of 7.5 , 15 , and 22.5",

    "the beam consists of fully stripped @xmath1ne@xmath15 ions after the target .",
    "the momentum dispersion measured in the dispersive focal plane ( t2 ) was 4.2 cm/@xmath12 corresponding to 2.1 cm/@xmath12 energy dispersion in non - relativistic approximation .",
    "this is in agreement with the design calculations .",
    "a circular beam spot of about 20 mm diameter ( fwhm ) was observed in the achromatic final focal plane ( t3 ) .",
    "the ion optics of the _ gas - filled mode _ was tested by transporting the @xmath1ne@xmath13 beam onto the target t2 . without gas filling the momentum dispersion in the final focal plane was measured by inserting the copper foils and using the method mentioned above .",
    "the resulting momentum dispersion of 6.9 cm/@xmath12 is in agreement with the design calculations . after having verified the basic optical design parameter and that all separator components worked satisfactorily , we proceeded to produce @xmath1na isotopes required for one of the initial experiments .",

    "the rf was 32 mhz , providing a dynamic range of 31 ns for the tof measurement , just sufficient to observe the dynamic range of particles in the ne mass region without `` wrap - around '' that would complicate particle identification . due to the nature of the reaction the @xmath1na products are strongly focused and most of these fragments",
    "pass through the detector , i.e. the setting of the magnetic fields in _ section 1 _ is adjusted to optimize the @xmath1na yield .",
    "the detector is left in place during the measurements at t3 , functioning as a uniform degrader . in the panel on the right hand side the same spectrum",
    "is shown but this time with a gate on particles arriving in the detector at the focal plane t3 that has also a 20 mm diameter .",
    "optimizing the rigidity of _ section 2 _ , one can tune for the maximum yield of @xmath1na . only a small contribution of 0.5% of @xmath19ne",
    "is remaining while all other impurities including beam particles are reduced to insignificant contributions .",
    "note that in this test run the left side spectrum was measured using a polyethylene foil , while the right side was measured with the cooled hydrogen target to allow higher beam and therefore higher production rates .",

    "the maximum useful target thickness is obtained when the energy loss difference of the primary beam and the secondary beam corresponds to the energy acceptance ( 8 % ) of the separator .",
    "note , that using a h@xmath7 target the pressure windows only affect the acceptance due to straggling but not due to energy loss . in this way",
    "using a 10 bar target one may reach 10@xmath27 @xmath1na particles / s .",
    "this clean secondary @xmath1na beam was used later in a first experiment in collaboration with a group from lpc , caen , france @xcite to study the @xmath28-decay branching ratio in the @xmath1na decay .",
    "this ratio is important for the interpretation of the @xmath28-@xmath29 correlation measurements @xcite performed as tests of the standard model .",
    "the planned physics program @xcite requires also the production of very heavy isotopes like @xmath4ra that may be produced by using the fusion - evaporation reaction in inverse kinematics . if the radium atom has nearly degenerate states of opposite parity , @xmath4ra could be a candidate for the search for a ( forbidden ) permanent electric dipole moment .    in an early phase of the design",
    ", calculations were made with the transport code from m. paul @xcite , which incorporates charge - changing atomic collisions and energy loss in a gas - filled magnetic system .",
    "in particular the reaction @xmath30pb on @xmath23c was considered where one could collect all ra residues with 100% efficiency , as the effect of the evaporated neutrons is negligible compared to broadening due to multiple scattering in the gas .",
    "the simulations were made to find whether the residues and the beam can be separated sufficiently . in this application a clean separation is not essential if the ion - catcher device can handle the additional load due to the beam contamination . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pb - ra ] the result of this calculation is shown for a pb beam of 7 mev / nucleon on a carbon target placed at t2 with _ section 2 _ filled with 5 mbar ar .",

    "a more detailed measurement over two charge states is indicated by the two dashed gaussian curves that have each a fwhm of 0.37% @xmath33p / p .",
    "this is the overall resolution of the beam , including straggling in the entrance foil in front of the target .",
    "the triangles represent a scan over the focal plane after filling the complete system after the entrance foil with 2.5 mbar argon gas .",
    "the eleven separated charge states are now concentrated in a single peak corresponding to an average charge state due to the statistical process of charge - state changes in the gas . for comparison of the data sets the measured setting of the data obtained with gas filling were shifted in momentum to coincide with the maximum of the charge distribution measured in vacuum . for the same reason",
    "the beam current data were scaled to obtain the same total integrated particle current .",
    "the resulting distribution is well reproduced by a gaussian distribution , as can be observed from the fitted dotted curve .",
    "the fwhm was 1.4% @xmath33p / p or 8.6 cm in absolute width , i.e. nearly 4 times the width of a single charge state , but 6 times smaller than the full charge distribution .",
    "also the dependence on ar gas pressure was investigated . since the ion optics changes due to the energy losses in the gas , after each pressure change the magnet settings had to be adjusted empirically for best resolution .",
    "the width depended little on pressure .",
    "the best resolution was found at 2.0 mbar with a fwhm of 6.4 cm . at 5 mbar , the pressure corresponding to the calculations in fig .",
    "[ fig : pb - ra ] , the fwhm was 7.7 cm , i.e. 30% larger than the calculated value .",
    "the low beam current ( 0.2 particle - na ) did not allow us to conclude anything about the radium production or distribution .",
    "however , the observations so far indicate that the calculated properties appear to apply . to collect all heavy reaction products in _ gas - filled mode _ an ion catcher of about 10 cm diameter would be required .",
    "a versatile magnetic separator for the effective collection and separation of radio isotopes produced with a variety of heavy ion beams from the agor superconducting cyclotron was designed , built and commissioned at the kvi as part of the tri@xmath0p facility .",

    "aberrations up to 4@xmath35 order were calculated .",
    "it was found that orders higher than three were negligible .",
    "special care was taken to include optimally the existing infrastructure and hardware of the laboratory .",

    "( section 1 ) _ and a maximum product rigidity of 3.0 tm _ ( section 2)_. the angle acceptances are 30 mrad in both transverse directions .",
    "the momentum acceptance is @xmath112.0@xmath12 .",
    "this allows to transmit a large fraction of the phase space of the reaction products of interest using the inverse reaction technique into a cooler device . extrapolating the yields for light products up to @xmath36 particles",
    "/ s appears feasible .",
    "the system is designed to separate reaction products from light ( e.g. @xmath1ne ) to very heavy @xmath3pb beams with maximum beam intensities given by the power dissipation limit of about 1 kw in the cyclotron deflector .",
