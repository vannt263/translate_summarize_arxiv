    "um673 ( q0142@xmath9100 ) was first identified as a gravitationally lensed quasar ( qso ) at @xmath10 by @xcite who showed it to be lensed by a @xmath11 galaxy into two images , um673a and um673b , separated by 2.2arcsec and with magnitudes @xmath12 and 19.1 respectively .",
    "this pair was later examined in detail by @xcite in their study of intergalactic ly@xmath0  forest absorbers . by considering the number of absorption lines in common ( and not in common ) between the two closely spaced sightlines",
    ", these authors were able to place interesting limits on the typical sizes of ly@xmath0  clouds , following on from analogous analyses by @xcite and @xcite .    since these early papers",
    ", there have been many investigations of the ly@xmath0  forest in the spectra of gravitationally lensed qsos .",
    "however , very little is still known about the size and geometry of the neutral gas reservoirs that give rise to dlas with hydrogen column densities @xmath13@xmath14 , since these are much rarer absorption systems and thus unlikely to be found in front of gravitationally lensed qsos which are themselves unusual alignments . a recent study by @xcite of the quadruply lensed cloverleaf qso ( h1413 + 117 ) with the _ hubble space telescope",
    "_ uncovered three new dlas or sub - dlas at @xmath15 , none of which are common to all four components .",
    "when considered together with analogous observations of four other dlas from the literature , these data led @xcite to conclude that absorbers at @xmath15 with @xmath13@xmath16 have typical scale - lengths @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is the hubble constant in units of 70 km  s@xmath7  mpc@xmath7 ) . apparently at odds with this conclusion is the finding by @xcite of coincident damped lyman alpha absorption on 100kpc - scale towards the binary qso sdss  1116 + 4118a , b . as these dimensions far exceed those expected for a single galaxy , @xcite favour an explanation in terms of a group of two or more galaxies intersected along these lines of sight .",
    "in this paper we report the discovery of a previously unrecognised dla , at @xmath19 , in the spectrum of um673a from high resolution and high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) spectroscopy with the hires instrument on the kecki telescope . in line with the compilation of similar measurements by @xcite ,",
    "no dla is seen in front of um673b , even though at the redshift of the dla the two sightlines are separated by less than 3kpc .",
    "we do , however , find a weak ly@xmath0  _ emission _ line in the spectrum of um673b at the same redshift as the dla .",
    "there have been only a few reported cases of ly@xmath0  emission associated with a dla since the first such detection by @xcite , as summarised in the review of dla properties by @xcite with more recent updates by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "any new examples are of interest in view of the apparent puzzle presented by the lack of obvious star formation associated with gas - rich dlas @xcite , and the recent claim that a newly discovered population of faint line emitters represents the long - sought host galaxies of dlas @xcite .    finally , the newly discovered dla in um673a is metal - poor , with metallicity @xmath20 .",
    "such chemically unevolved dlas are important , in that they can provide clues to early episodes of metal enrichment in the universe , complementing efforts being directed to analogous studies of metal - poor stars in the milky way and nearby dwarf galaxies ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the present case , we measure the relative abundances of nine different elements , from n to zn , and uncover some chemical peculiarities which have not been noted before .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : um673_obs ] , we briefly describe the observations of um673a , b and the reduction of the hires spectra . in the subsequent analysis , we first focus on the hi gas in front of the um673 pair ( section  [ sec : dla ] ) , and consider the data presented here together with the compilation by @xcite of other dlas in gravitationally lensed qsos to refine those authors estimate of the characteristic size of damped systems ( section  [ sec : sizes ] ) .",
    "we next turn to the ly@xmath0  emission detected in the spectrum of um673b at the same redshift as the dla in um673a ( section  [ sec : lya ] ) , and use it to obtain an estimate of the star formation rate in the galaxy associated with the dla .",
    "section  [ sec : metals ] deals with the chemical composition of the dla , comparing it to that of dlas and galactic halo stars of similar overall metallicity .",
    "we summarise our findings and draw some conclusions in section  [ sec : conc ] . throughout the paper",
    ", we adopt a ` 737 ' cosmology , with @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we observed um673a and um673b on the nights of 2005 october 9 and 10 , and again three years later on the nights of 2008 september 24 and 25 , as part of a large - scale imaging and spectroscopic survey of galaxies in the fields of bright qsos , aimed primarily at studying the outflows of interstellar gas from star - forming galaxies at redshifts @xmath243 @xcite .",
    "hires @xcite was configured to cover the wavelength range 31006100  ( with small gaps near 4000  and 5000  due to gaps between the three ccd chips on the detector ) using the ultraviolet ( uv ) cross - disperser and collimator .    in order to avoid cross - contamination between the two images and to minimize slit losses due to atmospheric dispersion , um673 a and b",
    "were observed separately , with the hires slit maintained at the parallactic angle by its image rotator .",
    "for um673a we used a 1.15arcsec - wide entrance slit , which results in a resolution @xmath25 , corresponding to a velocity full width at half maximum @xmath26 km  s@xmath7 , sampled with @xmath27 pixels .",
    "the total integration time was @xmath28 , divided into five exposures ; the qso was stepped along the slit between each exposure . for the fainter um673b , we employed the narrower 0.86arcsec slit ( so as to exclude more effectively light from the brighter image ) which results in @xmath29 and @xmath30 km  s@xmath7 sampled with @xmath31 detector pixels .",
    "the total exposure time was @xmath32 , again divided into a number of separate exposures , typically 2700s long .",
    "the seeing was @xmath33arcsec fwhm throughout the observations .",
    "to these data we added another set of observations of um673a , b , which we retrieved from the keck observatory data archive , obtained in 1996 with the original hires red - sensitive detector and red - optimized cross - disperser . while these earlier data do not contribute much at blue and ultraviolet wavelengths , with their long exposure times ( 18000s and 27000s for um673a and b respectively )",
    "they do improve the s / n ratio of our final co - added spectrum at red wavelengths .",
    "the two - dimensional hires spectra were processed with the makee data reduction pipeline developed by tom barlow which includes the usual steps of flat - fielding , order tracing , background subtraction , 1-d extraction and merging of the echelle orders .",
    "a wavelength reference was provided by the spectrum of the internal th - ar hollow cathode lamp and the co - added , 1-d spectra were mapped onto a vacuum heliocentric wavelength scale . in a final step , the spectra were normalised by dividing out the qso continuum and emission lines .",
    "the rms deviations of the data from the continuum in regions free from absorption lines provide an empirical measure of the signal - to - noise ratio . for um673a ,",
    "our data have @xmath34 per 2.7 km  s@xmath7 ( @xmath35 ) bin from @xmath36  to @xmath37 ; the s / n is highest near 5000  ( @xmath38 ) and is still moderately high ( @xmath39 ) at 3200 , near the redshifted wavelength of the damped ly@xmath0  line .",
    "the corresponding values for um673b are @xmath40 ( 40006000 ) and @xmath41 at 3200 .",
    "our hires spectra extend to shorter wavelengths than most previous observations of this famous qso pair , which probably explains why the damped ly@xmath0  system in front of um673a ( see fig .  [ fig : um673adla ] ) has gone unnoticed until now .",
    "associated with the dla are a multitude of metal absorption lines of elements from c to zn .",
    "these lines are analysed in detail in section  [ sec : metals ] ; for the present purpose suffice it to say that they are narrow , with @xmath42 km  s@xmath7 , and have maximum optical depth at @xmath43 . adopting the same redshift for the damped ly@xmath0  line ( which is too broad to allow such an accurate determination of @xmath44 )",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , since @xmath13  and the velocity dispersion parameter @xmath50 ( km  s@xmath7 ) are degenerate in strongly saturated lines , we can still determine an upper limit to the column density by considering the smallest @xmath50-value , and corresponding highest value of @xmath13 , which provide an acceptable fit to the width and profile of the saturated ly@xmath0  line in um673b . to this end",

    "the corresponding line profile , convolved with the instrumental resolution , is superimposed on the data in the top panel of fig .",

    "the same conclusion is reached by comparing with the stellar abundances in the bottom panel .",
    "it seems unlikely that these apparently anomalous abundances are due to dust depletion , given that : ( a ) ti , ni , and zn are depleted to very different degrees in galactic dust @xcite , and ( b ) depletions are in any case expected to introduce very minor corrections when the overall metallicity is as low as 1/30 of solar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the unusually low abundance of zn ( an element which is not readily incorporated into dust grains and thus normally provides a reliable benchmark for the abundance of fe - peak elements , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : zn ] , where the value of [ zn / fe ] in um673a is compared with those measured in dlas and galactic stars . in the figure , the trend of decreasing [ zn / fe ] with decreasing [ zn / h ] in dlas is most naturally explained by the reduced dust depletion of fe at lower metallicities , until solar relative abundance of the two elements is recovered when @xmath71 } \\simeq -1.5 $ ] . in galactic stars , zn and fe track each other closely over two decades in metallicity ( from solar to @xmath72 solar ) , and zn becomes progressively _ _",

    "we have searched for clues in the composition of galactic stars that are much more metal - poor than 1/30 of solar , in the extreme regime where chemical anomalies due to enrichment by only a few prior episodes of star formation may manifest themselves , but found none .",

    ", width=302 ]    recently , data have become available on the abundances of these elements in individual stars of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the local group @xcite and in ultra - faint dwarf companions of the milky way @xcite .",
    "these measurements are of particular interest , as some of these galaxies may well have experienced different star formation histories from the stellar population(s ) of the galactic halo , and may therefore offer a different perspective for the interpretation of element ratios .",
    "it is thus intriguing to find that stars with [ fe / h]@xmath73 in the draco , sextans , and ursa minor dwarf spheroidal galaxies can exhibit sub - solar [ zn / fe ] ratios ( see fig .  [ fig : zn ] ) , and solar or sub - solar [ ti / fe ] ( in contrast with the super - solar [ ti / fe ] of galactic halo stars ) .",
    "however , the resemblance to the dla in um673a does not extend to other elements : in the dwarf spheroidal stars observed by @xcite and @xcite the mean value of [ ni / fe ] is approximately solar and [ cr / fe ] is mostly subsolar , whereas the opposite is found in the dla ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : metals ] ) .",

    "* ) , requiring data of unusually high s / n ratio for their abundances to be determined .",

    "+  ( i ) in the direction probed , the transverse extent of the dla is much less than 2.7kpc ( this being the separation of the two sightlines at @xmath78 ) , since we measure a drop by a factor of at least 400 in the column density of neutral hydrogen from um673a ( @xmath79(i)/@xmath80 = 20.7 $ ] ) to um673b ( @xmath79(i)/@xmath80 \\leq 18.1 $ ] ) .",
    "a comparable drop is seen in the column density of siii  and presumably other metals in stages that are dominant in i  regions .",
    "( ii ) from a reassessment of data on other qso pairs in the literature , together with the new results for um673a , b , we find that , if the radial profile of @xmath2(i ) in dlas declines exponentially , the median @xmath81-folding scale length is @xmath82 , smaller than had previously been realised . for a spherical cloud",

    "( iii ) towards um673b , we detect a weak and narrow ly@xmath0  _ emission _ line at the same redshift as the dla in um673a .",
    "if the line is due to recombination in ii  regions , which we consider to be the most likely interpretation , its low luminosity ( @xmath84 ) implies a modest star formation rate , @xmath85m@xmath6yr@xmath7 .",
    "however , this is probably a lower limit considering : ( a ) the ease with which resonant ly@xmath0  photons can be destroyed or scattered out of the line of sight , and ( b ) the limited spatial sampling of the narrow hires entrance slit .",
    "( iv ) in contrast with neutral gas , absorption by civ  exhibits only modest variations between the two sightlines .",
    "evidently , highly ionized gas extends over much larger physical dimensions than the dla , in accord with earlier conclusions from other qso pairs and recent work on galaxy - galaxy pairs .",

    "while comparably low values of [ zn / fe ] have been measured in some stars of nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies , other element ratios differ between these stars and the dla , so that a direct chemical correspondence can not be established .",
    "an interpretation of these peculiar element ratios in terms of the previous history of chemical enrichment of the gas is still lacking .    taken together",
    ", the small size , quiescent kinematics , and near - pristine chemical composition of the dla in front of um673a would suggest an origin in a low - mass galaxy .",
    "however , the detection of nearby ly@xmath0  emission adds a new ` twist ' to this picture .",
    "although not intersected by our line of sight , there must presumably be a significant mass of cold gas within @xmath27 kpc of the dla to fuel the star formation rate we deduce from the ly@xmath0  luminosity .",
    "if this is the case , then the properties we measure may refer to an interstellar cloud  or complex of clouds  within a larger galaxy , rather than being representative of the whole galaxy .",
    "this caveat may also apply to other dlas whose transverse dimensions have been probed with qso pairs .",
    "however , the fact that in _ none _ of the cases studied so far has common dla absorption been found over scales of a few kpc ( see table  [ tab : dla_sizes ] ) points to one ( or both ) of two possibilities : either interstellar clouds with @xmath2(i)@xmath89@xmath90 have covering fractions @xmath91 within the interstellar media of high redshift galaxies or , if @xmath92 , the host galaxies of most dlas are genuinely of small extent .",
    "the generally low metallicities of most dlas independently point to an origin in low luminosity galaxies as discussed , among others , by @xcite .",
    "looking ahead , the nature of the dla studied here would undoubtedly be clarified by integral field observations of um673 at the wavelength of the h@xmath0  emission line ( which at @xmath1 is redshifted into the near - infrared @xmath93-band , at @xmath94 m ) .",
    "its detection would confirm the presence of a star - forming region , its spatial extent , and whether or not it is lensed by the foreground galaxy . as a closing remark",

    "this is normally a safe assumption at the high neutral hydrogen column densities of dlas , where the gas is self - shielded from ionizing radiation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , given the unusual abundance pattern uncovered here , it is worthwhile reexamining the assumption that , for example , @xmath95 , and assess to what degree , if any , n may be over- or under - ionized compared to h ( and the same for the other elements considered ) .    to this end , we ran a suite of cloudy photoionization models @xcite , assuming that the dla can be approximated by a slab of constant density gas in the range @xmath96<3 $ ] . in our simulations , we included the @xcite metagalactic ionizing background , as well as the cosmic microwave background , both at the redshift of the dla .",

    "the same conclusion is reached if the radiation field responsible for ionizing the gas has a purely stellar origin , rather than the mix of active galactic nuclei and star - forming galaxies that is the source of the metagalactic background considered by @xcite .",
