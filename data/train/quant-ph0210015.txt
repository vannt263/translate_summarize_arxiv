    "entanglement is a basic resource for quantum information processing as well as for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics .",
    "several types of entanglement between photons have already been demonstrated : polarization entanglement @xcite , energy - time entanglement @xcite and time - bin entanglement @xcite , see @xcite for a review . in this paper",
    "we present a setup based on energy - time entanglement , where we add a frequency shift in one arm of each interferometer . experimentally the frequency shift is induced by using acousto - optic modulators ( aom ) in the interferometers instead of standard beamsplitters .",
    "the section ii of this article is devoted to the effects of a frequency shift on the time dependent coincidence rate in a franson - type bell experiment .",
    "this effect is the equivalent for 2-photon interferences to the phenomenon of beatings for single photon interferences .",
    "as the time needed to record interference fringes can not be arbitrarily small , the measured visibility is reduced in presence of beatings .",
    "when this measurement time is only limited by energy resolution , there is a simple relation between the visibility and the which - path information .",
    "experimentally we are far from accede to very short measurement times , therefore we propose an indirect method to show the beatings .",
    "the section iii presents the experimental setup in detail and the technics used to overcome the difficulties due to the frequency shifts .",
    "we have measured high visibility interference fringes when the beatings are canceled , and we have also measured the beatings frequency when it is not zero .    since an aom is equivalent to a moving beamsplitter , our setup can be used to perform experiments with apparatuses in two different relevant frames @xcite . in the conventional experiments with all apparatuses at rest , there is only one relevant inertial frame , i.e. one inertial frame of the massive pieces of the apparatus ( the laboratory frame ) and , therefore , only one possible time ordering : one of the photons is always measured before the other ( _ before - after _ situation ) . using two relevant frames it is possible to create a _ before - before _ time ordering , in which each measuring device in its own inertial frame analyzes the corresponding photon before the other , and an _ after - after _ time ordering , in which each measuring device in its own inertial frame analyzes the corresponding photon after the other @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanics predicts correlations independently of the time ordering , between the two single - photon measurements .",
    "by contrast , multisimultaneity @xcite , a recently proposed alternative theory , casts nonlocality into a time ordered scheme and predicts disappearance of nonlocal correlations with _ before - before _ timing .",
    "therefore , experiments with aoms allow us to test a most important feature of quantum entanglement as it is the independence of the time ordering .",
    "this is the subject of the section iv .",
    "when two monochromatic waves of frequencies @xmath0 and @xmath1 are combined the resulting wave exhibits two frequencies , one at @xmath2 and the other at @xmath3 this is the well known phenomenon of beatings .",
    "an application in the optical domain for classical light field is heterodyne detection @xcite .",
    "beatings can be seen as first order interferences in the time domain . for second order interferences , the same equivalence can be found .",
    "consider the franson - type configuration of figure [ franson ] ; a source s emits energy - time entangled pairs of photons .",
    "each photon is sent to an unbalanced interferometer .",
    "when both photons arrive in coincidence on the detectors it is impossible to distinguish between both photons passing by the short arms ( _ ss _ ) or both passing by the long ones ( _ ll _ ) because the photons emission time is undeterminated .",
    "hence interference fringes appear when the phases @xmath4 are changed . in our experiment , we consider not only phase changes in each interferometers but also changes of the photons frequencies .",
    "when both frequency shifts do not sum to 0 we will show that the coincidence rate between two detectors changes periodically in time .",
    "this is equivalent , for 2-photon interferences , to the phenomenon of beatings in one photon interferences , therefore we call it 2-photon beatings .     and",
    "@xmath5 are the lengths of the long and short arms of interferometer @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath4 are the frequency shift and phase shift in the short arm of interferometer @xmath6.,width=318 ]    following closely franson s calculation @xcite , the wave function at detector @xmath8 , @xmath9 , located at @xmath10 , is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the phase of interferometer @xmath6 , @xmath13 @xmath14 is the path difference between both arms of the interferometer and @xmath7 the frequency shift in the short arm of interferometer @xmath6 .",
    "the difference with franson s original calculation is that we consider an arbitrary frequency shift @xmath15 in one arm of the interferometers .",
    "we can expand the wave functions in the field operators @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the frequency of the photon in interferometer @xmath6 .",
    "the coincidence rate between 2 detectors is then given by @xmath19 using ( [ psi ] ) and ( [ serie ] ) in ( [ coin ] ) we find @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "this corresponds to franson s result , when @xmath22 , otherwise the coincidence probability is generally not constant in time .    when the entangled photons are created by downconversion @xcite , we have to take into account the finite bandwidth of the pump laser and of the photons",
    ". we find , assuming gaussian spectral distributions , that the coincidence probability is given by    @xmath23    with    @xmath24    where @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the central frequency of the pump laser , @xmath27 is the pump bandwidth and @xmath28 is the photons bandwidth .",
    "hence the visibility of the interference fringes is reduced by a factor @xmath29 . in absence of beatings ( @xmath30 ) , @xmath29 is the maximal visibility that can be measured .",
    "equation ( [ visibility ] ) contains all the usual conditions to see high visibility interference fringes ; the coherence length of the pump laser has to be greater than the path difference in one interferometer , and the photons coherence length has to be greater than the difference @xmath31 .    an application of entangled photons , apart from fundamental tests of quantum mechanics , is quantum cryptography .",
    "setups based on polarization , energy - time or time - bin entanglement have been proposed and realized , for a review see @xcite .",
    "one the other hand only one photon schemes with frequency shifted photons have been proposed @xcite . in appendix",
    "a we propose 2 different schemes with frequency shifted entangled photons , which can be used to implement quantum cryptography , although they are not actually of practical interest , due to technology limitations .",
    "if the beating frequency is not zero , the coincidence probability changes in time , decreasing the visibility of the interference fringes .",
    "according to feynmann `` principle '' @xcite , the disappearance of the interference fringes would implies accessibility , in principle , of information about which path the photons took @xcite .",
    "the frequency shift can be used to mark the path , only if we have enough coincidence events such that the time needed to experimentally estimate the coincidence probability is smaller than the intrinsic uncertainty @xmath32 on the time measurement given by saturating the energy - time uncertainty relation @xmath33 .",
    "otherwise information about the path is lost due to imperfect experimental devices .",
    "we can quantify this information and the corresponding loss of visibility .",
    "contrary to @xcite where the degree of freedom used to mark the photon ( i.e. polarization ) is different from the one where interferences are observed ( spatial mode ) , we use the frequency to mark the paths .",
    "this will affect the interferences by creating beatings as we have shown before .",
    "however due to the energy - time uncertainty relation there is still a relation between interferences visibility and which - path information .",
    "if the time needed to measure the coincidence probability is arbitrary small : @xmath34 , the coincidence probability will be given by @xmath35 , according to ( [ coincidence rate ] ) where we assume @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "for a finite time resolution we have to integrate this expression over a time distribution with a width @xmath32 , for example we consider a gaussian distribution : @xmath38 the corresponding visibility is @xmath39 the which - path information is given by measuring the total energy of the photons @xmath40 .",
    "this is done with a resolution @xmath41 related to the time resolution by the energy - time uncertainty relation @xmath42 .",
    "we predict that the photons would be detected in the @xmath43 arm if we measure @xmath44 , and in the @xmath45 arm otherwise .",
    "the which - path information @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 @xcite where @xmath48 is the probability of a correct prediction on the path . with our strategy",
    "we have @xmath49 hence the information is given by @xmath50 with @xmath51 being the error function .",
    "the extreme cases are either a perfect distinction between @xmath52 and @xmath43 events which requires that @xmath53 , but this implies a measurement time @xmath54 , averaging to zero the interferences ; or , on the contrary , if the measuring time is short enough to measure interference , then the energy resolution is to poor to distinguish the paths . for the intermediate case we have the known relation @xcite @xmath55",
    "the equality is not reached because of the prediction strategy is not optimal .",
    "let us emphasize that the preceding description does not rely on quantum mechanics but more generally on wave theory .",
    "the quantum nature appears when we assume that photons are quanta of light , and in the fact that the photon pairs we consider can not be described by classical local physics .      in our experiment ,",
    "when the rf drivers are not sychronized , the minimum value which can be set for @xmath56 is @xmath57 khz .",
    "this is too large to directly see the beatings by recording the coincidence rate vs. time .",
    "a first possible method , is to record the time of each coincidence event and reconstruct the beatings from those datas .",
    "this requires a clock precise enough over a long time .",
    "however this requires also that the coherence of the beatings signal is much longer than the acquisition time , so that the phases of the interferometers have to be kept stable during that time .",
    "we also need to know precisely the frequency @xmath58 , otherwise the analysis of the datas will be much more complicated , although not impossible .    instead of recording all the absolute times of arrival and reconstruct the beatings we could only measure the time difference between 2 successive coincidence counts and then measure the distribution of those times .",
    "the probability density @xmath59 of having two coincidences separated by a time @xmath32 can be computed in the following way . because the detection process is independent of time , except for a dead - time of the detectors @xmath60 , the conditional probability of having a coincidence at time @xmath61 and another one in time @xmath62 , knowing that a photon pair reaches the detectors at time @xmath61 and another one at time @xmath62 is only dependent of the beatings signal . @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the visibility and @xmath65 is a normalization constant . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume that the efficiency of the detectors is one .",
    "however we do not access the time @xmath61 but we only measure @xmath66 . therefore the probability of having two coincidences , knowing only that the 2nd photons comes @xmath32 after the first is given by @xmath67 because typically @xmath68 .",
    "the integration gives @xmath69\\ ] ] finally the probability density of having 2 coincidences separated by a time @xmath32 is obtained using the fact that the emission and detection are two poissonian processes independent of the beatings .",
    "therefore the probability @xmath70 of having two emissions separated by a time @xmath32 is @xmath71 hence the probability density @xmath59 of having two coincidence events separated by a time @xmath32 is given by @xmath72 with @xmath73 \\frac{1}{\\tau } \\exp \\left ( -\\delta t/\\tau \\right ) .$ ] we normalize this expression such that @xmath74 the final normalized expression is then @xmath75 \\exp \\left ( -\\delta t/\\tau \\right ) } { \\tau \\left ( 1+\\frac{v^{2}}{2}\\frac{1}{% 1+(\\omega^0 ) ^{2}\\tau ^{2}}\\right ) } \\ ] ] experimentally , we integrate @xmath76 over a time bin @xmath77 so the measured probability is @xmath78 the total counts @xmath79 in @xmath80 seconds in each time bin is @xmath81 the advantage of this method to see 2-photon beatings is that the interferometer have only to be stable during the time between two successive coincidences . in section iii.f we present the results of the beatings frequency using this method .",
    "the setup we use to test entanglement of the photon pairs with frequency shift , is based on previous franson - type experiments @xcite .",
    "the main conceptual difference is the frequency shifts in one arm of the interferometers .",
    "the photon pairs are created by parametrical down - conversion in a recently developed high efficient source .",
    "it is based on a waveguide integrated on a periodically poled lithium niobate ( ppln ) substrate @xcite . using a pump at 657 nm",
    ", it generates degenerated photons at 1314 nm .",
    "we chose this wavelength as it corresponds to a transparency window in optical fibers .",
    "hence it is possible to use this setup for long distance transmission .",
    "an rg1000  filter is placed after the waveguide to eliminate the pump light , and an additional interference filter is used to narrow the generated photons bandwidth .",
    "the photon pairs are coupled into a 50/50 fiber optics beam - splitter which separate the twin photons .",
    "violation of bell inequality has already been demonstrated with this source @xcite .      as for franson type experiments , we use michelson interferometers as analyzers .",
    "we replaced in each interferometer the beam - splitters by aom s ( acousto - optic modulators , brimrose amf-100 - 1.3 - 2 mm ) .",
    "they have two effects .",
    "first they induce a frequency shift equal to the acoustic wave frequency as we will see , second they can be seen as moving beamsplitter as required for a relativistic bell experiment @xcite .     reflects part of the incoming light , whose frequency is @xmath40,height=188 ]    an aom is made of a piece of glass , amtir 1 ( amourphous material transmitting ir radiation ) , in which an acoustic wave at frequency @xmath82 ( 100 mhz in our experiment ) is created by a piezo - electrical transducer @xcite . as the refractive index in a material depends on the pressure , the acoustic wave will create a periodical change of the refractive index , equivalent to a diffraction grating ( fig .",
    "[ aom ] ) .",
    "if the acoustic wave is traveling rather than stationary , it will be equivalent to a _ moving _ diffraction grating",
    ". this can be achieve if the aom ends with a skew cut termination to damp the wave .",
    "as for a standard grating , the reflection coefficient is maximal at bragg angle @xmath83 given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the sound wavelength , @xmath86 is the light wavelength in vacuum and @xmath87 the refractive index of the material .",
    "the reflection coefficient is , for small angles @xmath88 @xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the acoustic power , @xmath91 is the penetration of light through the acoustic wave , and @xmath92 is a material parameter",
    ". the acoustic power can be set , such that the beamsplitting ratio is 50/50 .",
    "the reflected wave undergoes a frequency shift of @xmath93 if it hits the acoustic wave in the same direction as figure [ aom ] , in the opposite case the frequency shift is @xmath94 .",
    "the reflection on a moving mirror produces a frequency change of the light @xcite , due to the doppler effect , given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the mirror velocity and @xmath97 the angle between the incident light and the plane of reflection . within an aom",
    "the reflected light is also frequency shifted and the frequency shift is equal to the acoustic wave frequency : @xmath98 using @xmath99 , @xmath100 and equations ( [ bragg ] ) and ( [ shift ] ) we find that the frequency shift induced by the aom is the same as the one induced by a mechanical grating traveling at speed @xmath101 .",
    "the velocity of sound in the amtir 1 can be computed from the mechanical parameters of the material .",
    "the velocity for primary sound waves @xcite is given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 , @xmath105 is the young modulus and @xmath106 is the poisson ratio . for amtir 1",
    "we have @xcite @xmath107 pa , @xmath108 and @xmath109 kg / m@xmath110 , hence @xmath111 m / s .",
    "this corresponds to the manufacturer value of @xmath112 m / s .",
    "the phase of the reflected wave is also shifted by a value @xmath113 which is the phase of the acoustic wave at the time when the light is reflected .      .",
    "when both photons pass through the long arms , the total energy is not changed , but when they pass through the short arms the total energy becomes @xmath114 .",
    "it is required that @xmath115 to avoid that beatings hide the correlations.,width=318 ]    we have built two bulk michelson interferometers using aom s instead of beamsplitters .",
    "the light is coupled out of the fiber using an apc connector to avoid backreflection at the fiber s end .",
    "because of the small deviation angle @xmath116 ( about 5@xmath117{0xb0}}% % beginexpansion { { } ^\\circ}% % endexpansion $ ] ) we collect only the light coming back into the input port by using a fiber optical circulator ( fig .",
    "[ orientation ] ) . due to imperfect overlap of the modes ,",
    "the transmission through each interferometer is about 45% , with monochromatic light .",
    "the transmission through the reflected arm is reduced for large bandwidth photons , because the deviation angle depends of the light wavelength .",
    "hence an aom will act as a band - pass filter for the reflected beam with a measured bandwidth of about 30 nm . to minimize this effect which could reduce the fringes visibility we have to insure that the bandwidth of the photons is smaller by placing after the source a spectral filter ( 11 nm bandwidth ) .",
    "the condition to observe interferences is given by equation ( [ visibility ] ) .",
    "it is the usual condition for 2-photon correlations , the path differences @xmath118 between the short and the long arm of the interferometers have to be equal within the coherence length of the photons . without frequency shifts ( @xmath119 ) the equalization of the paths of both interferometers can be done by putting them in serie @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ alignement ] ) and looking for the interferences between the @xmath120@xmath121 and @xmath122@xmath123 paths . using a low coherence light , interferences appears only when @xmath124 is equal to @xmath125 within the coherence length of the light .",
    "this implies that @xmath126 ( in our interferometers @xmath127 ) .",
    "unfortunately this method can not directly work when there is a frequency shift .",
    "indeed when we put our interferometers in serie , with the aom s oriented as for the 2-photon experiment , the frequency shifts do not cancel anymore but beatings appear between the @xmath120@xmath121 and @xmath122@xmath123 paths at the frequency of @xmath128 mhz . in order to observe those beatings we use a fast pin detector ( 2 ghz bandwidth ) connected to an electrical spectrum analyzer .",
    "as such a detector is not very sensitive , we use a very bright led source ( opto speed sa sled 1300-d10a ) . with this setup",
    "it is easy to scan the long path of one of the interferometers until we see classical beatings .",
    "once the path length differences are equalized we can look for 2-photon interference with the setup of ( fig .",
    "[ orientation ] ) . therefore the frequency shifts have to cancel each other such that @xmath129 ( eq . [ coincidences rate with beatings ] ) .",
    "we orient the aom as described such that the frequency shifts are of opposite signs ( fig .",
    "[ orientation ] ) .",
    "hence we have @xmath130 mhz ( because we pass 2 times through each aom ) and @xmath131 mhz",
    ".    experimentally we can only specify an upper bound on @xmath132 .",
    "the requirement is given by the fact that we have to integrate over times much larger than @xmath133 to estimate the coincidence probability with small statistical error ( typically 10 - 20 s ) .",
    "therefore , even if the temporal resolution of the detectors would have been good enough to see interference fringes in principle ( eq . [ vvsdt ] ) , the integration cancels them .",
    "hence we can only see interference fringes if @xmath134 .",
    "otherwise we have to use an indirect means of observing the beatings , as described in the next section .",
    "finally one should note that if the frequency shift @xmath135 is greater than the photon bandwidth @xmath136 @xmath137 it will be possible to distinguish the path by measuring only the energy of one photon . in that case",
    "the correlations disappear because the phase shift on the reflected wave will not be well defined as the mirror is moving",
    ". more precisely this phase change due to the change of the mirror position during the coherence time @xmath138 of the photon is given by @xmath139 interference fringes can be seen only if @xmath140 , which is in contradiction with equation ( [ 1-photon_distingu ] ) .",
    "each aom is driven by a radio - frequency driver ( brimrose fff-100-b2-v0.8-e ) which generates a 100 mhz . as we have seen",
    "we need to synchronize the radio - frequency drivers with a frequency difference smaller than @xmath141 hz .",
    "this is done by using the fact that the 100 mhz frequency is generated in each driver by multiplying a 1 mhz signal from an oscillator with a phase locked loop ( pll ) .",
    "the synchronization is achieved by using the same oscillator for both drivers . in practice",
    "we send the signal from one of the driver s oscillator to the other driver through a coaxial cable .",
    "the ratio of the frequencies , measured with a frequency - meter , is @xmath142 , so that @xmath143 hz .",
    "another point to look at is the shape of the electrical spectrum on both sides .",
    "we verified with a spectrum analyzer that both spectrum widths are smaller that the resolution of the analyzer ( 100 hz ) .",
    "once the synchronization is correctly done we observe interference fringes with high visibility ( fig .",
    "[ fringes ] ) .",
    "the vivibility after subtracting the accidental coincidences is about 97% . the visibility without subtracting the noise is about 45% .",
    "we have verified that the visibility is reduced when the electrical spectrums of the drivers are slightly different .",
    "the frequency of one of the drivers can be changed by steps of 15625 hz . due to",
    "beatings , no interference fringes can be observed when the drivers are set at different frequencies .",
    ".,width=318 ]    the phase difference @xmath144 between the 2 synchronized acoustic waves induces the same phase change in the 2-photon interference fringes .",
    "@xmath144 depends on the length @xmath145 of the synchronization cable @xmath146 where @xmath147 with @xmath148 and @xmath149 being the wavelength and frequency of the 1 mhz synchronization signal .",
    "hence we have @xmath150 with @xmath151 the speed of the synchronization signal .",
    "we can measure @xmath152 by changing the length of the synchronization cable and measuring the induced phase shift on the interference fringes .",
    "we clearly observe a frequency shift when we add or remove 0.53 m or 1.03 m of cable ( fig .",
    "[ phase2pi ] ) .",
    "the mean phase shift per meter @xmath152 of cable added on 5 measurements is @xmath153 rad / m .",

    "we have measured the time difference between successive coincidences and we plot the histogram of those measurements .",
    "the time bins of the histogram are of @xmath157 s and we plot it for times between 0 s and 0.1 s. the figure [ exponentiel ] shows the exponential decrease , as expected for random events . however at a closer look we see that the exponential decay is modulated by a cosinus ( fig .",
    "[ beatings ] ) .",
    "we fit an approximation of equation ( [ beatings_prob ] ) @xmath158 \\exp \\left ( -t/\\tau \\right ) } { \\tau \\left ( 1+\\frac{v^{2}}{2}% \\frac{1}{1+\\omega ^{2}\\tau ^{2}}\\right ) } \\label{exp_beatings}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because the width of the histogram time bins is small enough ( @xmath159 ) .",

    "classically , correlations between separated events can be explained by two different mechanisms : either both events have a common cause in the past , e.g. two separate tv apparatuses showing the same images because connected to the same channel ; or one event has a direct influence on the other , e.g. dialing number on my phone makes the phone of my colleague ring . in both cases there is a time - ordered causal relation .",
    "quantum correlations , on the other hand , are of very different nature . quantum mechanics",
    "predicts correlated outcomes in space - like separated regions for experiments using pairs of entangled particles .",
    "many experiments have demonstrated such quantum correlations , under several conditions @xcite , in perfect concordance with the quantum mechanical predictions .",
    "the existence of correlations shows that the outcomes of the two measurements are not independent .",
    "however , in that case , violation of bell s inequality rules out the common cause explanation @xcite .    to explain the correlations one could invoke a possible influence of one outcome on to the other . since the correlated events lie in space - like separated regions , such a direct influence would have to be superluminal .",
    "moreover this would define a preferred frame , because the time - ordering between two space - like separated events is not relativistically covariant .",
    "one could imagine a unique preferred frame which is relevant for all the quantum measurements .",
    "the pilot - wave model of de broglie and bohm @xcite assumes such a preferred frame .",
    "this model perfectly reproduces the results of quantum mechanics , and the assumed connections , though superluminal , can not be used for faster than light communication @xcite . moreover , since quantum mechanics is independent of the timing , bohm s preferred frame is experimentally indistinguishable . another theory assuming a unique preferred frame has been proposed by eberhard @xcite . in this model",
    "the connection between the events is not only superluminal but it propagates at a finite speed , and leads to faster than light communication .",
    "if , in the preferred frame , both choices occur in a time interval short enough , the correlations would disappear as the influences would not have the time to propagate .",
    "however , experimentally this theory can not be refuted , because the speed of the influence can be arbitrary large and is not specified by the theory .",
    "a different natural possibility would be to assume that the relevant reference frame for each measurement is the inertial frame of the massive apparatus , and to define a time - ordered dependence by means of several preferred frames .",
    "this possibility has been developed within a theory called multisimultaneity @xcite .",
    "more specifically , multisimultaneity assumes that the relevant frame is determined by the analyzer s inertial frame ( e.g. a polarizer or a beam - splitter in our case ) . paraphrasing bohr , one could say that the relevant frame , hence the relevant time ordering , depends on the very condition of the experiment @xcite .    in multisimultaneity , as in the pilot - wave model ,",
    "each particle emerging from a beam - splitter follows one ( and only one ) outgoing mode , hence particles are always localized , although the guiding wave ( i.e. the usual quantum state @xmath161 ) follows all paths , in accordance with the usual schrdinger equation .",
    "when all beam - splitters are at relative rest , this model reduces to the pilot - wave model and has thus precisely the same predictions as quantum mechanics .",
    "however , when two beam - splitters move apart , then there are two relevant reference frames , each defining a time ordering , hence the name of multisimultaneity . in such a configuration",
    "it is possible to arrange the experiment in such a way that each of the two beam - splitters in its own reference frame analyzes a particle from an entangled pair before the other .",
    "each particle has then to  decide  where to go before its twin particle makes its choice ( even before the twin is forced to make a choice ) .",
    "multisimultaneity predicts that in such a _ before - before _",
    "configuration , the correlations disappear , in contrary to the quantum predictions .",
    "whereas quantum mechanics is nonlocal and independent of the time ordering , multisimultaneity assumes a nonlocal but time - ordered dependence between the events . nevertheless , this alternative model is not in contradiction with any existing experimental data prior to the present experiment .",
    "furthermore , it has the nice feature that it can be tested using existing technology .",
    "this means that _ before - before _",
    "experiments are capable of acting as standard of time - ordered nonlocality ( much as bell s experiments act as standard of locality ) .",
    "since it would have been very difficult to put conventional beamsplitters in motion , we used traveling acoustic waves as beamsplitters to realize a _ before - before",
    "_ configuration .",
    "it has been argued that the state of motion of the moving acoustic wave defines the rest frame of the beam - splitters @xcite .",
    "we would like to stress that a before - before experiment using detectors in motion has already been performed confirming quantum mechanics , i.e. the correlations did nt disappear @xcite .       and",
    "@xmath162 and the detection signals are send to a coincidence circuit .",

    "the dashed lines represent the light cone.,width=226 ]    as we have seen , an aom is a realization of a moving beam - splitter .",
    "we can then use our interferometers to perform a bell experiment with moving beam - splitters ( fig .",
    "[ exp_schem ] ) in order to confront quantum mechanics predictions with multisimultaneity .",
    "we need to perform the experiment in the so called _ before - before _ condition .",
    "the criterion given by special relativity for the change in time ordering of two events in two reference frames counterpropagating at speed @xmath96 ( fig .",
    "[ frames ] ) reads @xmath167 where @xmath32 and @xmath168  are respectively the time difference and distance between the two events in the laboratory frame @xcite .",
    "this criterion is much more stringent than the spacelike separation condition @xmath169 . due to the high speed of the acoustic wave ( 2500 m / s ) ,",
    "a distance of 55 m between the interferometers is enough , and allows us to realize the experiment inside our building .",
    "the permitted discrepancy on the time of arrival of the photons in the aom is then , according to ( [ dt ] ) , @xmath170 ps , corresponding to a distance of @xmath171 mm in air .      to observe the predicted disappearance of the correlations , the spreading of the wave - packet due to the finite bandwidth of the photons combined with the chromatic dispersion of the optical fibers has to be smaller than @xmath32 .",
    "first , the coherence length of the single photons is determined by the filter after the source . with a 11",
    "nm filter the photons coherence length is about 0.15 mm .",
    "next , the chromatic dispersion spreads the photon wave packet .",
    "however , thanks to the energy correlation , the dispersion can be almost canceled .",
    "the requirement for the 2-photon dispersion cancellation @xcite is that the center frequency of the 2 photon is equal to the zero dispersion frequency of the fibers .",
    "we measured this value on a 2 km fiber with a commercial apparatus ( eg&g ) which uses the phase shift method .",
    "we found a value of @xmath172 nm for @xmath173 .",
    "we use 100 m of the same fiber assuming that the dispersion is constant along the fiber .",
    "we set the laser wavelength at half this value . knowing the chromatic dispersion and conservatively assuming a 1 nm difference between the laser wavelength and @xmath174 , the pulse spreading over 100 m can be computed and is 0.2 ps ( for more detail see @xcite ) .",
    "this corresponds to a length of 0.06 mm in air , which is much smaller than the permitted discrepancy .",
    "the total spread is given by @xmath175 mm .",
    "the length difference between the fibers joining the source to two the interferometers can be measured with a precision of 0.1 mm using a low coherence interferometry method @xcite .",
    "the error on the interferometers path lengths is measured manually with a precision smaller than 0.5 mm . however , as the error is of the order of @xmath176 , we scan the path length difference by pulling on a 1 m long fiber .",
    "one end of the fiber is fixed on a rail as the other one is fixed to a translation stage which is fixed to the rail .",
    "the fiber can be elongated over a range of about 10 mm in the elastic region . as the refractive index changes with the stress we need to calibrate the effective change in the optical path vs. the fiber elongation ( fig .",
    "[ calibration ] ) .",
    "we measure the visibility of the interference fringes for each step of 0.10 mm corresponding to a change of the path in air of 0.11 mm as given by the calibration .",

    ", the correlations would vanish smoothly . for a path difference of @xmath178 the distribution of the times of arrival of the photons",
    "is given by @xmath179 hence the visibility is given by the convolution of both functions : @xmath180 in our case @xmath181 mm due to dispersion and the photon coherence length .",
    "the figure [ vvsdelta ] shows the measured visibility for different path difference and the expected curve according to multisimultaneity .",
    "it is clear that there is no disappearance of the correlations in the _ before - before _",
    "situation .",
    "another intriguing situation is the opposite , where each measurement device is analyzing its photon in its own reference frame after the other analyzer photons .",
    "we call it _ after - after _ situation , for which multisimultaneity also makes predictions conflicting with quantum mechanics , and in our particular case disappearance of the correlations , as in the _ before - before _ situation @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the _ after - after _ situation is done by inverting the direction of the acoustic waves , without changing the other adjustments of the experiment .",
    "figure [ after ] shows a measurement of the visibility in function of the path difference .",
    "no change larger than the experimental fluctuations can be observed around the 0 difference point .",
    "we have modified the usual 2-photon franson interferometry scheme by using aom s instead of standard beamsplitters . adding a new degree of freedom to the state of entangled photons leads to new effects , in particular 2-photon beatings .",
    "these are equivalent for the 2-photon interferences to the usual 1-photon beatings .",
    "we have experimentally demonstrated 2-photon intereferences when the beating frequency is 0 . in the other case when it is not null we have measured the beatings .    as the reflection on an acoustic wave is equivalent to the reflection on a moving mirror we have used our interferometers to test non - local correlations under different time orderings . in the _ before - before _",
    "situation , each `` choice - device '' is the first to analyze its photon in its own reference frame . in this situation",
    "the correlation would disappear if they where due to some time - ordered influence between the events , as multisimultaneity assumes .",
    "experimentally , we do nt see any vanishing of the correlations .",
    "hence , not only , the quantum correlations can not be explained by local common causes as demonstrated by violating bell s inequality , but moreover one can not maintain any causal explanation in which an earlier event influences a later one by arbitrarily fast communication .    in conclusion , correlations reveal somehow dependence between the events .",
    "but regarding quantum correlations , our experiment shows that this dependence does not correspond to any real time ordering .",
    "quantum entanglement can not be cast into any relativistic scheme .",
    "this work would not have been possible without the financial support of the  fondation odier de psycho - physique  and the swiss national science foundation .",
    "we thank valerio scarani and wolfgang tittel for very stimulating discussions and franois cochet from alcatel cable suisse sa for having placed at our disposal the chromatic dispersion measurement instrument .",
    "the quantum theory has allowed to develop new cryptographic protocols , in particular quantum key distribution .",
    "two people , alice and bob , can create a shared secret key by exchanging quantum particles .",
    "coding bits into photons whose states are randomly chosen between non - orthogonal bases prevent any effective attack by a third person .",
    "a similar protocol based on the quantum correlations between entangled particles has been proposed @xcite . in this appendix",
    "we present two schemes for quantum cryptography using 2-photon correlations .",
    "the first one uses the phenomenon of beatings as described in section 2 , to simulate two basis at @xmath182 .",
    "the second is the analogous with 2 photon of the interferometric scheme with frequency separation @xcite .",
    "first , we briefly review the principle of 2-photon quantum cryptography with phase coding @xcite .",
    "it is based on franson 2-photon interferences ( fig .",
    "[ cryptoaom ] ) .",
    "alice and bob chose a phase in their respective interferometers ( corresponding to the choice of a basis ) . when the bases are compatible ( @xmath188 )",
    "there is a perfect correlation between the outputs of both interferometers , the correlation coefficient @xmath105 is equal to 1 .",
    "when the basis are incompatible ( @xmath189 ) the correlation coefficient vanishes , the outcomes are completly independant and random .",
    "this is sumarized by the following table .",
    "those correlations can be used to create a secret key between alice and bob .",
    "this scheme could be implemented with our setup if alice and bob set their frequency shifts such that @xmath30 .",
    "they can change their respective phases by modulating the phase in one arm ( i.e. by changing the length ) .",
    "however they can also change the phases by changing the phase of the synchronisation signal on each sides as we have seen in section iii e.    instead of changing the phase alice and bob can change the frequency of the photons . as they are looking for interferences between the short - short and long - long paths , beatings will appear if the sum of the frequency shift is not zero ( section iii f ) .",
    "the probability coincidences are given by equation [ coincidences rate with beatings ] where the global phase is fixed to @xmath191 .",
    "@xmath192 putting @xmath193 we find the previous table .",
    "but we could change @xmath194 without changing @xmath195 .",
    "hence if we set @xmath196 we have @xmath197 if @xmath198 we find the perfectly correlated case , otherwise they will be an additional phase of @xmath199 which is not equal to @xmath200 , as in the phase coding .",
    "however , as the emission time of the photons is not known , the @xmath199 value is uniformly distributed , .",
    "so the mean value of @xmath201 averaged over time is equal to @xmath191 , corresponding to the non correlated case .",
    "we can then write a similar table as the previous one but with the phases @xmath202 replaced by the frequency shifts @xmath7 : @xmath203 we should keep in mind that the correlation value in this table is only a mean value , therefore we call it pseudo - complementary basis . if eve knows the detection time of a photon she could follow the beatings , she will always know the value of @xmath204 and can wait for a time @xmath205 , such that @xmath206 , so to know which detector clicked on alice side .",
    "therefore the detection time should be kept secret as long as the photon did nt reach bob side .",
    "however , alice and bob have to perform a coincidence detection to select only the short - short and long - long events . in order to discriminate these events ,",
    "the time uncertainty @xmath207 on the coincidence has to be smaller than the time difference @xmath208 between short and long arms .",
    "moreover , if the uncertainty on the detection time send by alice is greater than the beatings period , eve can not extract any information on the timing .",
    "this requires @xmath209 .",
    "for example if @xmath210 mhz we have @xmath211 ns so @xmath208 should be greater than 04 ns , which is the case in our experiment ( @xmath212 ns ) .    finally ,",
    "if we imagine that eve is able to measure when the photon passes ( by quantum non - demolition measurement ) , she can again follow the beatings and set her measurement time such that she is in perfect correlation with alice .",
    "to avoid this attack alice should changed at random at which time she sent the photon to bob .",
    "again , the uncertainty on the emission time @xmath207 has to be greater than @xmath213 .",
    "such scheme of quantum key distribution would not be easy to implement , because it requires stabilisation of the interferometers as for the phase coding . moreover fast changes of the frequencies of the aom s are needed , but this is not the case with today s modulators .          in contrary to the preceding scheme ,",
    "where one photon interferences occur between two spatially separated paths , a scheme where the paths are frequency separated has been proposed and realized in @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup was done using faint laser pulses , which , for this purpose , is equivalent to a single photon scheme .",
    "it has the advantage of not requiring an interferometers stabilization .",
    "we will see that this one photon scheme can be generalized to a 2-photon one .",
    "but first , we briefly review the original scheme .",
    "alice creates a photon in a superposition of two states of different frequencies by modulating light at frequency @xmath135 ( fig [ 1photonbes ] ) and by applying a phase difference @xmath214 .",
    "hence the state of a photon at frequency @xmath40 becomes              the generalization to 2-photon interferometry can be done because each single photon cryptographic scheme is equivalent to a 2-photon scheme up to local unitary transformation @xcite . in this case , the equivalent scheme consists in a source emitting a state                after the filters the following state remains @xmath225 this state can be used to implement 2-photon quantum key distribution .",
    "moreover this scheme as only one output .",
    "it can be generalized to a system with 2 outputs ( bb84 ) by doing the following frequency transformation @xmath226",
