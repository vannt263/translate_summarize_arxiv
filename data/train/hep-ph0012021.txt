    "<S> , we expect that the branching ratio @xmath107 increases with increasing @xmath61 while @xmath108 is rather insensitive to @xmath61 . </S>",

    "<S> this leads to a large mass - splitting of @xmath0-@xmath21 and a small one of @xmath1-@xmath22 , which results in sufficient phase spaces for the bosonic decays of @xmath1 .    in a complete analysis </S>",
    "<S> one would have to calculate the full susy - qcd one - loop corrections to the widths of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays . </S>",
    "<S> however , we expect that these corrections will not invalidate the dominance of the bosonic modes in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays in a significant portion of the mssm parameter space as shown in our analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of the full corrections is beyond the scope of the present paper .    </S>",
    "<S> now we discuss the signatures of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the signals of the decays into bosons ( eq .  ( [ eq : bmodes ] ) ) with those of the decays into fermions ( eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : fmodes ] ) ) . in principle , the final states of the bosonic decays can also be generated from fermionic decays . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the final particles of the decay chain [ chaina ] _ 1 _ 1 + ( h^+ w^+ ) ( b _ 1)+(q    b + ( q |q^_1 ) . nevertheless , the decay distributions of the two processes ( [ chaina ] ) and ( [ chainb ] ) are in general different from each other due to the different intermediate states . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the b in the chain ( [ chaina ] ) tends to be softer than the b in ( [ chainb ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> a similar argument holds for the quark pairs @xmath205 in the decay chains . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the distribution of the missing energy - momentum carried by @xmath206 could be significantly different in ( [ chaina ] ) and ( [ chainb ] ) since it is emitted from a different sparticle . </S>",
    "<S> hence the possible dominance of the bosonic decays over the conventional fermionic decays could have an important impact on the search for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and on the measurement of the mssm parameters . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the effects of the bosonic decays should be included in the monte carlo studies of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays into higgs or gauge bosons , such as @xmath0 @xmath207 @xmath1 + @xmath208  or  @xmath209 , can be dominant in a fairly wide mssm parameter region with large mass difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , large @xmath210 and/or @xmath180 , and large @xmath64 ( and large @xmath61 for the @xmath0 decay ) due to the large yukawa couplings and mixings of @xmath4 and @xmath5 . compared to the fermionic decays , such as @xmath211 , these bosonic decays can have significantly different decay distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that the effect of the susy - qcd running of the quark and squark parameters on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays is quite dramatic . </S>",
    "<S> these could have an important impact on the searches for @xmath0 and @xmath1 and on the determination of the mssm parameters at future colliders . </S>"
