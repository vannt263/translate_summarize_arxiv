    "quantum phases of matter and their transitions are of fundamental concern to modern condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "such interest is motivated not only by potential technical applications , but also on purely scientific grounds .",
    "research in this field may lead to a deeper understanding of the fundamental working principles behind nature s behavior , and often original new physical theories emerge .",
    "one of them , recently proposed in ref . , predicts the existence of a class of systems whose critical behavior lies outside the scope of the landau theory of phase transitions @xcite .",
    "critical points in these systems are characterized by the deconfinement of fractionalized excitations , parameterizing the original degrees of freedom , which occurs right at the transition .",
    "it was observed that this scenario can , in principle , be realized in spin systems , which exhibit a second - order phase transition point characterized by the simultaneous breakdown of a continuous ( e.g. spin @xmath0 ) and a discrete ( e.g. lattice ) symmetries , in such a way that symmetry groups on opposite sides of the transition are not group - subgroup related .",
    "such critical points can not be described in the framework of landau s theory .    according to ref . , there should exist a substantial number of spin systems , which exhibit deconfined critical points .",
    "for instance , frustrated two - dimensional ( 2d ) antiferromagnets ( afs ) , like the @xmath1-@xmath2 model , are believed to fall into this category .",
    "however , there seems to be no experimental or theoretical proof of this claim .",
    "another class of models believed to display such a behavior includes non - frustrated afs with multi - spin exchange interactions .",
    "one such model was studied by sandvik @xcite and other authors @xcite and , although seemingly artificial , it provides a playground for testing new theories .",
    "their quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations claimed numerical evidence for the deconfined quantum criticality scenario .",
    "the model studied in ref . is a heisenberg af with a subset of four - spin ring exchange interactions , defined on a square lattice ( named the @xmath3-@xmath4 model ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 denote sites in a 2d square lattice and @xmath8 are spin-@xmath9 operators .",
    "the first summation extends over bonds ( nearest neighbor sites ) .",
    "the second term contains two sums over plaquettes ( sites of the dual lattice ) : first , @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote parallel horizontal links of the plaquette , and then @xmath12 and @xmath13 correspond to parallel vertical bonds .",
    "it was concluded @xcite that there exists a critical point at @xmath14 separating the antiferromagnetic phase from a valence - bond solid ( vbs ) state , whose nature is , strictly speaking , unclear @xcite but the calculations suggested a columnar ( dimer ) order in this paramagnetic region .",
    "in the present paper we study the phase diagram of the @xmath3-@xmath4 model , using a recently proposed hierarchical mean - field ( hmf ) technique @xcite .",
    "the main idea of the method revolves around the concept of a _ relevant _ degree of freedom ( a `` quark '' )  spin cluster in this particular case  which can be used to build up the system .",
    "the initial hamiltonian is then rewritten in terms of these coarse - grained variables and a mean - field approximation is applied to determine properties of the system .",
    "thus , the ( generally ) exponentially hard problem of determining the ground state of the system is reduced to a _ polynomially _ complex one . at the same time , essential quantum correlations , which drive the physics of the problem , are captured by the local representation . in other words , provided the quark is chosen properly , even a simple _ single _ mean - field approximation , performed on these degrees of freedom , will yield the correct phase diagram . moreover",
    ", our hmf ansatz provides an _ educated nodal surface _ that can , in principle , be used in conjunction with fixed - node ( or constrained path @xcite ) qmc approaches to further improve correlations , and thus energy estimates , in those cases when there is a sign ( phase ) problem .",
    "it is important to emphasize the simplicity of our method . in this work we concentrate on symmetries of the various phases , exhibited by the @xmath3-@xmath4 model . by using a more sophisticated variational ansatz ( e.g. a jastrow  type correlated wavefunction )",
    ", one can also improve numerical values of the observable quantities and phase transition points , but the physical picture will remain intact .",
    "nevertheless , the hmf method was quite accurate to yield the quantitatively correct phase diagram @xcite of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model , whose behavior is driven by the interplay of two gapless phases : the nel and columnar af states . in the @xmath3-@xmath4 model",
    "the large-@xmath4 phase is gapped . due to its real - space nature",
    ", the hmf method should be appropriate for this model . indeed , our recent studies @xcite of another gapped system  the heisenberg model on the shastry - sutherland lattice  support this assumption",
    ".    -@xmath4 model , obtained in the present paper .",
    "the translationally invariant af phase with broken @xmath0 symmetry and the singlet paramagnetic state are separated by a quantum phase transition at @xmath15 .",
    "results of our calculations indicate that this transition is continuous , but we can not rigorously discard the possibility that it becomes weakly first order in the thermodynamic limit . the non - magnetic phase breaks the lattice translational symmetry and is a _",
    "plaquette paramagnet_. ]    our findings are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig_phase_diag ] .",
    "there indeed exists a non - magnetic phase , which we found to be of a _ correlated plaquette _ type , and not of a dimer character , separated from the nel state by a second - order phase transition .",
    "however , the numerical value of the critical point , @xmath16 , which we obtained , is quite different from that of ref . .",
    "our results are consistent with data obtained from exact diagonalization of finite spin clusters which , given the fact that the system is gapped in the paramagnetic phase for @xmath17 , should be reliable in this region .",
    "although we found the phase transition to be of the landau second - order type , due to the real - space nature of the method ( which explicitly breaks the lattice translational invariance ) , we can not rigorously rule out the possibility that this phase transition becomes weakly first order as one scales the degree of freedom towards the thermodynamic limit .    in the next section we set up the formalism .",
    "the results are presented in sec .",
    "[ section3 ] , followed by a discussion in sec .",
    "[ section4 ] .",
    "for our purposes it is convenient to separate the two and four spin terms in the @xmath3-@xmath4 hamiltonian : @xmath18    a satisfactory coarse graining procedure should partition the lattice into spin clusters ( quarks ) , containing @xmath19 sites , that explicitly preserve symmetries of the hamiltonian . in particular , the @xmath3-@xmath4 hamiltonian is explicitly spin@xmath0 invariant .",
    "moreover , it is invariant under transformations from the lattice rotational group @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , we will consider only symmetry preserving degrees of freedom : ( _ i _ ) plaquettes ( @xmath21 spin clusters ) and ( _ ii _ ) @xmath22 spin clusters .",
    "each cluster state will be associated with a hard - core bosonic operator @xmath23 .",
    "these operators are schwinger bosons of @xmath24 and must obey the local constraint : @xmath25 .",
    "they define the hierarchical language @xcite for our problem .    from the form of eq .",
    "it is clear @xcite that the ( equivalent and exact ) bosonic hamiltonian will contain not only two - body scattering processes , but also four - boson interactions .",
    "therefore , we can write down symbolically : @xmath26 where @xmath27 label states in the hilbert space of a quark , @xmath28 denote sites in the coarse grained lattice , and summations are assumed over all repeated indices . the term with @xmath29 encodes two - body interactions , while the last two lines describe the correlated four - boson scattering .",
    "the superscript @xmath30 indicates that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are horizontal links of a plaquette , and similarly @xmath33 denotes the case when @xmath34 and @xmath35 are vertical links of the same plaquette .",
    "we will investigate the phase diagram of the @xmath3-@xmath4 model using the hmf approximation whose variational state assumes that the hard - core bosons form an insulating state .",
    "further , we introduce a new set of bosonic operators , related to the old ones by a real site - independent canonical transformation : @xmath36 and write the variational ground state in the form : @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the lowest energy single - particle mode ( we shall also denote : @xmath39 ) , and @xmath40 represents the vacuum .",
    "it is important to emphasize that although the coarse graining procedure preserves the symmetries of the hamiltonian , some of them can be spontaneously broken at the mean - field level as a result of self - consistency . in particular , the columnar dimer state is contained in the wavefunction although , as we will see below , it never appears as a stable solution .",
    "we have explicitly separated the four - boson interaction in the hamiltonian into horizontal and vertical link contributions .",
    "this distinction is important because these two terms must be properly symmetrized to fulfill bosonic statistics .",
    "in particular , the term @xmath41 has to be symmetrized only with respect to indices in the same group , and groups as a whole ( groups are separated by semicolons ) , i.e. one needs to take into account only the following permutations : @xmath42 , @xmath43 and simultaneously ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) .",
    "analogously , in the term @xmath46 only the permutations @xmath47 , @xmath48 and ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) should be accounted for .",
    "the problem then reduces to minimization of the energy functional : @xmath51}{n}=&(h_\\box)_{a^\\prime a}r_{a^\\prime } r_a+ \\nonumber \\\\   & + \\bigl(h^2_{\\rm int}\\bigr)^{a^\\prime_1a^\\prime_2}_{a_1a_2}\\prod_{\\nu=1}^2   r_{a_\\nu^\\prime}r_{a_\\nu}+ \\label{energy_functional } \\\\   & + \\bigl(h^{4h}_{\\rm int}+h^{4v}_{\\rm int}\\bigr)^{a^\\prime_1a^\\prime_2 ;   a^\\prime_3a^\\prime_4}_{a_1a_2;a_3a_4}\\prod_{\\nu=1}^4r_{a_\\nu^\\prime}r_{a_\\nu }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] under the constraint @xmath52 , which leads to the self - consistent eigenvalue equation :    [ mean_field_eq ] @xmath53 with the chemical potential @xmath54 being the lowest eigenvalue of the hartree - fock hamiltonian : @xmath55    once the amplitude @xmath56 is determined , the ground state energy ( gse ) can be computed using eq .",

    "although we have formulated the hmf method for spin-@xmath9 systems , it can be straightforwardly extended to higher spins as well .    besides the gse we will also be interested in computing the staggered magnetization @xmath57 , and the two - component vbs `` order parameter '' @xcite : @xmath58 which allows us to characterize lattice point group symmetries of a state .    in the rest of this section we will sketch the hmf calculation of @xmath59 , @xmath57 and @xmath60 for the case of plaquettes , and only present final expressions for the @xmath22 clusters .",

    "for cases ( _ i _ ) and ( _ ii _ ) , respectively .",
    "although @xmath60 is an integral quantity , it is sufficient for the purpose of discriminating between plaquettized and dimerized ground states .",
    "namely , a plaquette phase preserves the four - fold lattice rotational symmetry , implying @xmath98 while in a dimerized state this equality does not hold . in fig .",
    "[ psi_2x2_4x4 ] we show @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the equality is satisfied throughout the phase diagram .",
    "this fact is not surprising in the antiferromagnetic phase , but in the paramagnetic region it presents a strong evidence against any type of dimerized ground states .",
    "although such states were allowed in the process of minimization , the @xmath20-symmetric states always had lower energy .",
    "in fact , the ground state in the non - magnetic region is a plaquette paramagnet , with each plaquette being in its singlet ground state .",
    "however , due to the tensor nature of interactions in these plaquettes are interacting .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , the coarse graining procedure explicitly breaks the lattice translation invariance , which should be restored in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "extrapolation to @xmath82 shows that @xmath99 , suggesting that the translation invariance is indeed being recovered .",
    "and @xmath4 terms in for a @xmath22 spin cluster with periodic boundary conditions . the unimportant term @xmath100 is omitted . ]    our calculations , presented in the previous section , demonstrate that the hamiltonian exhibits a phase transition point separating the nel ordered state from a paramagnetic phase with broken translational invariance , in agreement with conclusions of previous works @xcite .",
    "most importantly , besides establishing the existence of a phase transition , we were also able to unveil the nature of the paramagnetic phase and show that a _ correlated plaquette state _ is favored over a columnar dimer state which , although not conclusively , seems to be preferred according to previous calculations @xcite .",
    "however , despite qualitative agreement , there is a quantitative discrepancy in the numerical value of @xmath83 .",
    "namely , the value obtained in the present paper is much smaller than the one presented in ref . .",
    "although we can not provide a rigorous explanation for this discrepancy , we would like to make some qualitative remarks in the following :    first of all , it is clear that the variational wavefunction , being a low - density ansatz , generally leads to an under - estimation of the four - boson scattering terms in eq . .",
    "in order to understand how significant this error is and check that the results , presented in figs . [ gse_2x2_4x4][mag_2x2_4x4 ] , are reasonable , we used data from the exact diagonalization of @xmath22 spin clusters to compare magnitudes of the two terms : the ones , proportional to @xmath3 and @xmath4 , in eq . .",
    "on physical grounds one would expect a phase transition to occur when these terms become comparable .",
    "figure [ ed_4x4 ] presents the two contributions and their dependence on @xmath78 .",
    "of course , the crossing point at @xmath101 does not determine the critical value @xmath83 , but it provides a clue on where the phase transition may occur .",
    "since the system is gapped in the paramagnetic phase , one can argue that the size @xmath22 is large enough to describe the thermodynamic limit .",
    "indeed , qmc data for @xmath102 indicates that the gse converges very rapidly with increasing system size @xcite . also",
    ", calculations analogous to that shown in fig .",
    "[ ed_4x4 ] , performed @xcite for systems up to @xmath103 sites , indicate that the magnitude of the crossing point stays of order unity .",
    "second , we would like to emphasize that , although there is no question about the correctness of the qmc studies of refs . , the procedure used to extract physical quantities , like @xmath83 , from the raw statistical data , is not straighforward and requires certain assumptions @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to have another independent determination of the phase transition point , for example , from the data on staggered magnetization , computed in the entire @xmath4 range . while such calculations would definitely help to resolve this issue , surprisingly , they have never been performed .",
    "qmc computations of finite lattices does not suffer from the infamous sign problem in this case , thus it yield better energy and magnetization values than the ones obtained here . our approach , on the other hand , focuses on establishing symmetry properties of different phases , rather than improving numerical values for observable quantities .",
    "it is this fact , which enables us to detect phase transition points within a simple framework .",
    "our conclusions raise another important question regarding the nature of the phase transition .",
    "we find it to be of the landau type .",
    "although the finite - size scaling of the second - order derivative of the gse , presented in the previous section , displays a finite jump as @xmath82 , there is no way to rigorously prove it .",
    "thus , the possibility of a weakly first order transition at @xmath83 can not be completely excluded . indeed , in ref .",
    "it was argued that this phase transition , which was claimed to occur at the same point as in ref . , is of the first order . as any real - space method",
    "our approach explicitly breaks translational invariance , and although the finite - size scaling for @xmath60 implies that this property is restored with increasing cluster size , we can not provide a rigorous symmetry - based analysis .    in summary , we determined the phase diagram of the @xmath3-@xmath4 model , by using the recently proposed hierarchical mean - field approach @xcite .",
    "it was shown that there exists a _ single _",
    "( i.e. universal ) mean - field framework ( variational ansatz for the ground state ) , which gives the complete phase diagram of the model .",
    "in particular , we found that there exists a critical point at @xmath104 , which separates the antiferromagnetic phase from the non - magnetic state .",
    "the latter breaks lattice translational invariance and was shown to represent a correlated _ plaquette paramagnetic _ phase .",
    "our results suggest that the phase transition at @xmath83 is of a landau second order type , even in the thermodynamic limit @xmath82 , although we can not rigorously exclude the possibility for it to become weakly first order .",

    "<S> we study the quantum phase diagram of the heisenberg planar antiferromagnet with a subset of four - spin ring exchange interactions , using the recently proposed heirarchical mean - field approach . by identifying relevant degrees of freedom , </S>",
    "<S> we are able to use a single variational anzatz to map the entire phase diagram of the model and uncover the nature of its various phases . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that there exists a transition between a nel state and a quantum paramagnetic phase , characterized by broken translational invariance . </S>",
    "<S> the non - magnetic phase preserves the lattice rotational symmetry , and has a correlated plaquette nature . </S>",
    "<S> our results also suggest that this phase transition can be properly described within the landau paradigm . </S>"
