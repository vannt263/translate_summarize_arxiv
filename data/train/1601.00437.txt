    "graphene plasmons ( gps ) , the intrinsic collective oscillations of electrons coupled with electromagnetic waves in doped graphene , have attracted enormous interests for their unique properties , including such as inherently highly controllable , long - lived and extremely electromagnetic field confinement and enhancement in mid - infrared and terahertz spectral regimes@xcite . since theoretically proposed by jablan _",
    "et al _ in 2009@xcite , gps have been widely studied for electro - optical modulation@xcite , quantum plasmonics@xcite , light harvesting@xcite , transformation optics@xcite and infrared biosensors@xcite at nanometer scale . due to large wavevector mismatch between gps and free light field , propagating gps",
    "are usually excited by deep sub - wavelength point - like sources@xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the sources such as emitters , absorbers and scatterers serve as dipoles perpendicular or parallel to the propagation plane of gps@xcite . however , the propagation direction of excited gps is usually isotropic in the graphene plane as a result of the symmetry of structures and excitation configurations . and the unidirectional launching of gps is still unsolved problem although it is important in ultracompact plasmonic devices at the chip scale .",
    "on the other hand , to achieve highly directional launching of surface waves in metal , attempts have been made to break the symmetry by introducing oblique incidence@xcite , double slits@xcite and circularly polarized incident waves@xcite , etc . among the numerous reported methods ,",
    "the use of near field interference of a circularly polarized wave is cornerstone for active switching , along with very high extinction ratio between different directions .",
    "however , the current experimental effort to mimic a two - dimensional rotating dipole by oblique incidence is controversial due to the inevitable magnetic induction currents@xcite .",
    "it is well - known that two orthogonally oriented dipoles can be induced by two orthogonally polarized incident plane waves .",
    "aware of that a circularly polarized dipole can be efficiently mimicked by a nanowire illuminated by two orthogonal plane waves due to the extremely localization of gps , it is natural for us to consider realizing unidirectional generation of gps by using a combined circularly polarized dipole in unstructured graphene .",
    "furthermore , the combined dipoles can be separated in space compared to a single circularly polarized dipole , which provides us another degree of freedom to control the excitation of gps .    in this study , two orthogonally",
    "oriented dipoles are employed to efficiently excite symmetric and anti - symmetric charge ordering modes in flat and arc graphene planes .",
    "as long as the constructive and destructive interferences of near - fields take place in different propagation directions , the unidirectional launching of gps occurs . due to the inherent phase difference between symmetric and anti - symmetric evanescent modes induced by @xmath1-polarized and @xmath0-polarized dipoles , the extra phase difference of @xmath2/2 , e.g. , circularly polarized dipoles , should be introduced . moreover ,",
    "when the circularly polarized dipole is decomposed into two linear polarized ones and separated on different sides of the graphene , the behaviors of induced charge distribution and handedness of the background field are opposite . in",
    "further , the circularly polarized dipole can be efficiently mimicked by a semiconductor nanowire illuminated by two orthogonally polarized plane waves in experiments , and the problem about magnetic induction currents induced by oblique incidence can be solved in our considered system .",
    "we believe our findings should be found applications in compact plasmonic circuits in mid - infrared and terahertz regimes .",
    "the phenomena of unidirectional excitation of gps can be understood by considering a dipole placed at a subwavelength distance close to a free standing graphene sheet .",

    "i.e. , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is satisfied , so the induced magnetic field has a relation of @xmath15 .",
    "one can conclude that the complete interferences take place as long as @xmath16 and @xmath17 have equally modulus with phase difference of @xmath18/2 .",
    "the contribution from the graphene can be included by introducing reflected and transmitted fields , which can be calculated via simply multiplying the individual angular spectrums with corresponding fresnel coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",

    "the former induced by @xmath0-polarized dipole ( abbreviated as @xmath16 for convenience ) satisfies @xmath38 , while the latter induced by @xmath1-polarized dipole satisfies @xmath39 .",
    "the fundamental mechanism for directional generation is the charge density induced by @xmath16 has an even parity both in angular spectrum and real space@xcite , whereas the opposite hold true for a @xmath17 dipole .",
    "the superposition of @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( not the @xmath42 with opposite parities ) leads to the constructive and destructive interferences in different directions .    when the @xmath16 or @xmath17 dipole is moved to its image position ( 0 , -@xmath43 ) , noting that @xmath44 and the minus sign should be adopted before @xmath17 in the expressions of @xmath42 thanks to @xmath45 , therefore the charge density can be written as @xmath46 where the tildes means the quantity induced by dipoles located at its image position .",
    "therefore , one can obtain the relation of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this result means that moving the @xmath16 dipole to its image position will switch the preferred propagation direction of gps , while moving the @xmath17 dipole will not change the preferred direction .",
    "this behavior is quite counterintuitive . because the magnetic field induced by the dipole satisfied @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which means that moving a @xmath17 dipole to its image position will change the incident dipole fields , while they keep unchanged when moving @xmath16 dipoles .",
    "combination of these two facts leads to an amazing result that the incident and induced fields have different preferred propagation directions .",
    "remarkably , the finally preferred direction of gps is determined by the induced charge pattern rather than the incident field .",
    "there are a lot of parameters to quantitative describe the asymmetrical excitation . among them ,",
    "the angular spectrum ratios satisfy @xmath51\\equiv|f(k_x)/f(-k_x)|=|\\frac{\\frac{p_z}{p_x}\\frac{k_x}{k_z}+1}{-\\frac{p_z}{p_x}\\frac{k_x}{k_z}+1}|$ ] , ( @xmath52 ) which depend on @xmath53 only",
    ". moreover , the spatial dependent near field ratios defined as @xmath54\\equiv|f(x)/f(-x)|$ ] , ( @xmath55 ) are also very important for gps which can be obtained via full - field simulations and verified by near field experiments directly . in engineering ,",
    "another important parameter to quantify the asymmetrical transmission is extinction ratio , which is defined as the logarithm of energy flux ratio in opposite directions @xmath56 .",
    "the right and left energy flux along the graphene can be obtained by integrating the relative poynting vector along @xmath0 direction far from the dipole source @xmath57",
    "we present several scenarios in which the proper choices of dipoles close to graphene sheet provide possibilities for directional excitation of gps .",

    "similar to the superposition of polarizations , these two opposite sense of rotations lead to a classification of vibration ellipses according to their handedness , which is decided by the phase difference of two vibration vectors .",
    "if the phase difference satisfies @xmath113 , the superpositions are linear polarized dipoles , and their angular momenta is zero due to @xmath114 , thus the excited gps should be isotropic without any other asymmetry to fulfill the conservation of angular momentum .",

    ", there are three important factors to determine the handedness and preferred direction .",
    "the first one is the initial phase difference @xmath116 which is from the dipoles themselves , e.g. , if the initial @xmath117 changes from @xmath84 to @xmath118 , the handedness , i.e. , rotational direction of background field and preferred direction will change .",
    "the second factor is the dipole position relative to the graphene . from the relation",
    "@xmath119 $ ] , one can known that moving @xmath17 dipole to its image position will introduced a minus sign due to the sign function , which is equivalent to introduce extra @xmath2 phase difference when talking about the handedness and the initial electromagnetic field , while there is no extra phase difference when moving the @xmath16 dipoles to their image position . the total extra phase difference from aforementioned two factors",
    "will determine the handedness and the preferred direction of initial field .",
    "however , they are insufficient to determine the preferred direction of exited gps . noting that the scattering field of upper and lower sides of graphene satisfied @xmath120 for free standing graphene , which introduced a minus sign compared to the continuous boundary condition @xmath121 .",
    "this is the last vital factor to determine the preferred direction of induced field .",
    "actually , the aforementioned counterintuitive result is originated from the minus sign , which can not be treated as extra phase difference as before because it only acts on induced field and do not affect the handedness and the distribution of initial magnetic field . in a word , there are three factors for @xmath17 to affect the preferred direction of excited gps , while only two factors for @xmath16 to affect the preferred direction of excited gps in our considered system .",
    "when the @xmath17 and @xmath16 locate in the same side of graphene , @xmath122 always denotes the magnetic field in the dipole side , thus the angular momentums of @xmath73 and @xmath109 have the same sign owing to the conservation of angular momentum .",
    "when they are in the different side , @xmath74 in @xmath4 induced by the two dipoles denotes different sides of graphene , and the preferred direction of gps should be decided by @xmath109 rather than @xmath73 . due to the extra minus sign ,",
    "the preferrer direction of @xmath109 and @xmath73 is always opposite in this condition .",
    "the spatial dependent induced charge density is plotted in fig . [ fig3](c ) .",
    "one can find that the charge oscillates only in the -@xmath1 direction which is in good agreement with the analytical result .",
    "the comparison of spatial dependent extinction ratio of a single circularly polarized dipole ( named after case ) and two orthogonal polarized dipoles placed at both sides of the graphene ( named after case ) are shown in fig . [ fig3](d ) .",
    "one can see the extinction ratio is over 20 for @xmath123 , and the ratio in case is less than that in case , this originates from the opposite preferred directions of the initial and induced fields in case .",

    "the simulated result of nanowire is similar to the analytical result with actual extinction parameter , one can see that the energy flux ratio mimicked by nanowire exceed 100 when the propagation length is less than 2@xmath68 , and the extinction ratio exceed 10 in the whole calculation window .",
    "we demonstrated here that near field interference of a circularly polarized dipole and two mirror image symmetric dipoles with orthogonally polarizations can directional generate propagating gps .",
    "the viewpoint of angular momentum conservation is very efficient to determine the preferred direction of exited gps .",
    "when the dipoles are laid in different sides of graphene , the spatial charge density rather than the magnetic field should be adopted to analysis the excited gps due to the extra minus sign from the discontinuous of magnetic field . in this condition ,",
    "the magnetic field of dipole and induced charge distribution have opposite preferred directions and the properties of excited gps should be described by the behavior of induced charge .",
    "moreover , the direction generation of gps can be extended into arc surface directly .",
    "furthermore , a semiconductor nanowire can be regarded as a localized source to mimic the polarized dipoles , which can be realized in real experiments .",

    "<S> the highly unidirectional excitation of graphene plasmons ( gps ) through near - field interference of orthogonally polarized dipoles is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the preferred excitation direction of gps by a single circularly polarized dipole can be simply understood with the angular momentum conservation law . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the propagation direction of gps can be switched not only by changing the phase difference between dipoles , but also by placing the @xmath0-polarized dipole to its image position , whereas the handedness of the background field remains the same . </S>",
    "<S> the unidirectional excitation of gps can be extended directly into arc graphene surface as well . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our proposal on directional generation of gps can be realized in a semiconductor nanowire / graphene system , where a semiconductor nanowire can mimic the circularly polarized dipole when illuminated by two orthogonally polarized plane waves . </S>"
