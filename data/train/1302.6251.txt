    "<S> equivalently , @xmath51 can be seen as a quantum reference system , such that if one traces over @xmath51 , every ground state of @xmath57 is equiprobable , as identified by a complete set of superselection rules  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> comparing eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ theorem ] ) and ( [ bound ] ) we obtain a unified lower bound to frustration encompassing both the non degenerate and degenerate cases : @xmath58 the above exact inequality yields that , in the quantum domain , frustration is not only due to the underlying geometry , as for the classical case , and/or to entanglement , as for systems with non degenerate ground states . in general , it depends on the interplay of these two elements with a third source , namely statistical correlations established outside of the @xmath11-fold degenerate local ground space due to the degeneracy encoded in the mmgs . </S>",
    "<S> when the ground state is pure and non degenerate , the general bound eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ newbound ] ) evaluated on the mmgs reduces to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bound ] ) , as the classical correlations @xmath59 vanish and the convex roof @xmath33 coincides with @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> let us illustrate with a simple but nontrivial example the difference between the local and on average characterizations of frustration provided , respectively , by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bound ] ) and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ newbound ] ) . consider a ring of five spins with periodic boundary conditions described by a ferromagnetic ising hamiltonian ( ) . all local terms in the hamiltonian commute : </S>",
    "<S> in this sense , the model is classical . </S>",
    "<S> the global and local ground states are both two - fold degenerate ( spin - flip symmetry ) . since every element of the global ground space is ff , the model is locally always ff , i.e. ff on each of the different degenerate global ground states , and hence ff on average , that is ff on the mmgs . </S>",
    "<S> next , let us modify the hamiltonian from classical ising to quantum @xmath60 : , while the geometry of the system remains unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> one would now expect that frustration in the system should arise from the non - commutativity of the local terms in the @xmath60 hamiltonian ( now the local ground space degeneracy @xmath20 ) . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , one verifies that the model is ines on average , i.e. the inequality eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ newbound ] ) is saturated by the mmgs , with the actual values of the frustration measure @xmath12 and of the total correlations @xmath61 depending on the anisotropy @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , for @xmath63 , one has @xmath64 for each of the five different spin pair - interaction terms . </S>",
    "<S> however , regardless of the value of @xmath62 , such model is never locally ines . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , given the doubly degenerate global ground space , let us pick e.g. the ground state that is eigenstate of the parity operator along the @xmath41 direction with eigenvalue @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> for this pure ground state , the measure of frustrations @xmath12 takes always the same values as for the mmgs ( this is actually an interesting general property for all twofold degenerate ground states  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the bipartite geometric entanglement @xmath66 is always well below the total correlations @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , with @xmath63 , one has @xmath67 . the impossibility to saturate inequality </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bound ] ) is related to the fact that the selected pure ground state breaks the symmetry of the model hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> modifying the geometry , e.g. by adding a direct antiferromagnetic interaction between the first and the third spin : @xmath68 , introduces a further , geometric source of frustration . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the mmgs no longer saturates inequality eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ newbound ] ) and the system ceases to be ines , thus signaling the presence of geometric frustration .    from the above discussions it follows that it would be desirable to identify a set of conditions to detect _ a priori _ the frustration properties of the global ground space of a given model or class of models . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions should include as a particular case the ones previously determined for non degenerate ground states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> extending the toulouse criteria  @xcite to the quantum domain , we need to identify a _ prototype _ model that is ines on average and then define a group of local operations under which the property of being ines on average is preserved . </S>",
    "<S> we define the prototype model as + [ * prototype model * ] : a quantum spin hamiltonian of the type : @xmath69 is a _ prototype _ model if there exists at least one local ground space common to all pair local interactions @xmath70 and every local coupling vector @xmath71 has non - negative components . having defined the prototype model , we state the following :    [ * conjecture 1 - ines property and prototype models * ] : _ all prototype models are ines on average . _ </S>",
    "<S> + [ * conjecture 2 - ines property and local transformations * ] : _ every model obtained from a prototype model by local unitary operations on each spin and partial transposition on any arbitrary set of sites @xmath72 is still ines on average_.    it is evidently quite hard to prove these two conjectures in all generality . in the supplementary material  @xcite , we provide an analytical proof for the one - dimensional quantum @xmath60 model in the thermodynamic limit , and strong numerical evidence obtained for more than @xmath73 randomly generated models with exchange interactions on arbitrary random graphs with a total number of sites @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> preservation of the ines property on average under partial transposition is to be expected because this property is directly related to the absence of geometric frustration in the model . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the preservation of the ines property on average is far from trivial . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> contrary to what happens under local unitary transformations , the properties of degenerate ground states of a given hamiltonian _ before _ and _ after _ partial transposition need not be related . as a straightforward example , let us consider a spin-@xmath25 heisenberg chain ( open boundary conditions ) of @xmath75 spins with homogeneous nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the global ground state is five - fold degenerate while the local ground space is three - fold degenerate and for any couple of interacting spins we have @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> performing partial transposition on spins @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( or , equivalently on spins @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) the original model maps in a antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain possessing both a nondegenerate global and local ground state with @xmath81 for both the pairs of spins @xmath82 and @xmath83 , while @xmath84 for the pair of central spins @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the transformed model has very different ground - state properties compared to the initial one , and yet it remains ines .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have derived an exact lower bound on a universal measure of frustration in the general case of degenerate ground states . </S>",
    "<S> the bound is expressed as the sum of two contributions , one due to bipartite ground - state entanglement and one due to bipartite classical correlations that are established after local generalized measurements on a quantum reservoir or a quantum reference frame . </S>",
    "<S> this further source of frustration adds to geometry and entanglement , yielding a rather complex structure that involves several fundamental concepts of quantum physics : entanglement of mixed ground states , classical correlations arising from quantum degeneracy , and the purification of ground states via quantum reservoirs or quantum reference frames .    </S>",
    "<S> we have showed that the frustration properties of quantum many - body hamiltonians are encoded in the maximally mixed ground state ( mmgs ) , that is the convex combination with equal coefficients of all the degenerate pure ground states . </S>",
    "<S> given such on average , global classification , we have determined the sufficient conditions for a quantum spin system to achieve the bound , generalizing the results obtained in the case of models with non degenerate ground states  @xcite . for systems with doubly degenerate ground states </S>",
    "<S> we have proved rigorously that local and average frustration coincide : all degenerate ground states , and therefore also the mmgs , exhibit the same frustration properties  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the residual classical correlations after local generalized measurements are identified as a novel source of frustration in quantum many - body systems may open interesting research insights concerning competitions among quantal and non - quantal aspects in hamiltonian spin dynamics , as in the case of the anisotropic heisenberg models in an external field , or competition between quantal dynamics and thermal fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> future investigations should address the role that the presence / absence of the ines property on average actually plays in computational  @xcite , information - theoretic  @xcite , and thermodynamic characterizations  @xcite of many body quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> experimental consequences might soon be derived and tested , as the controlled quantum simulation of magnetism , classical and quantum , already includes the first demonstration of antiferromagnetic spin chains with optical lattices  @xcite , the probing of small frustrated heisenberg spin systems by photonic simulators  @xcite , the realization of classically frustrated ising spins with trapped ions  @xcite and optical lattices  @xcite , up to the recent comprehensive proposals for the quantum simulation of large classes of quantum frustrated magnetism with ion crystals  @xcite and color centers in diamond  @xcite that might open the way to the precise verification of long - standing predictions on exotic phases of matter . in this respect , the use of tools inspired by quantum information science can lead to a broader and deeper understanding of collective quantum phenomena via long - range _ `` entanglement patterns '' _  @xcite , beyond the landau - ginzburg framework of symmetry breaking and local order parameters  @xcite .    </S>",
