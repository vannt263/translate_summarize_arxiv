    "the two - point function is one of the key observables to understand phase transitions and critical behavior .",
    "for example , the two - point function for the ising model indicates how likely the spins located at those two sites point in the same direction .",
    "if it decays fast enough to be summable , then there is no macroscopic order .",
    "the summability of the two - point function is lost as soon as the model parameter ( e.g. , temperature ) is above the critical point , and therefore it is naturally hard to investigate critical behavior .",
    "the lace expansion is a powerful tool to rigorously prove mean - field behavior above the model - dependent critical dimension .",
    "the mean - field behavior here is for the two - point function at the critical point to exhibit similar behavior to the underlying random walk .",
    "it has been successful to prove such behavior for various statistical - mechanical models , such as self - avoiding walk , percolation , lattice trees / animals and the ising model .",
    "the best lace - expansion result obtained so far is to identify an asymptotic expression (= the newtonian potential times a model - dependent constant ) of the critical two - point function for finite - range models , such as the nearest - neighbor model .",
    "however , this ultimate goal has not been achieved , before this paper , for long - range models , especially when the 1-step distribution for the underlying random walk decays in powers of distance ; only the infrared bound on the fourier transform of the two - point function was available .",
    "this was partly because of our poor understanding of the long - range models in the @xmath14-space , not in the fourier space .",
    "for example , the random - walk green s function is known to be asymptotically newtonian / riesz depending on the power of the aforementioned power - law decaying 1-step distribution , but we were unable to find optimal error estimates in the literature . also , the subcritical two - point function is known to decay exponentially for the finite - range models , but this is not the case for the power - law decaying long - range models ; as is shown in this paper , the decay rate of the subcritical two - point function is the same as the 1-step distribution of the underlying random walk .",
    "therefore , the goal of this paper is to overcome those difficulties and derive an asymptotic expression of the critical two - point function for the power - law decaying long - range models above the critical dimension , using the lace expansion .",
    "we would also like to investigate crossover in the asymptotic expression when the power of the 1-step distribution of the underlying random walk changes .",
    "self - avoiding walk ( saw ) is a model for linear polymers .",
