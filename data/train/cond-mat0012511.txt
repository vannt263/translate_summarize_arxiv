    "the microscopic derivation of the effective time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory continues to attract attention since an early paper by abrahams and tsuneto @xcite .",
    "whereas the static gl potential was derived @xcite from the microscopic bcs theory soon after its introduction , the time - dependent gl theory is still a subject of interest ( see @xcite for a review on the problem s history ) .",
    "one of the reasons for this is the presence of landau damping terms in the effective action . for @xmath1-wave superconductivity",
    "these terms are singular at the origin of energy - momentum space , and consequently they can not be expanded as a taylor series about the origin . in other words , these terms",
    "do not have a well - defined expansion in terms of space and time derivatives of the ordering field and therefore they can not be represented as a part of a local lagrangian .",
    "we recall that at @xmath4 and for the static ( time - independent ) case the landau damping vanishes , so that either at @xmath4 one still has a local well - defined time - dependent gl theory or for @xmath5 the familiar static gl theory exists .",
    "it is known , however , that for @xmath1-wave superconductivity even though the landau terms do exist , they appear to be small compared to the main terms of the effective action in the large temperature region @xmath6 @xcite , where @xmath7 is the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "this is evidently related to the fact that only thermally excited quasiparticles contribute to the landau damping .",
    "the number of such quasiparticles at low temperatures appears to be a small fraction of the total charge carriers number in the @xmath1-wave superconductor due to the nonzero superconducting gap @xmath8 which opens over all directions on the fermi surface .    for a @xmath0-wave superconductor",
    "there are four dirac points ( nodes ) where the superconducting gap @xmath9 becomes zero on the fermi surface .",
    "the presence of the nodes increases significantly the number of the thermally excited quasiparticles at given temperature @xmath10 comparing to the @xmath1-wave case .",
    "therefore one can expect that the landau damping should be stronger for superconductors with a @xmath0-wave gap which is commonly accepted to be the case of high - temperature superconductors ( htsc ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is believed that at temperatures @xmath11,these quasiparticles are reasonably well described by the landau quasiparticles , even though such an approach fails in these materials at higher energies @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why one can hope that a generalization of the bcs - like approach @xcite for the 2d @xmath0-wave superconductivity may be relevant to the description of the low - temperature time - dependent gl theory in htsc .    in this work",
    "we derive such a theory from a microscopical model with @xmath0-wave pairing extending the approach of @xcite developed for @xmath1-wave superconductivity . as known from @xcite the physical origin of the landau damping",
    "is a scattering of the thermally excited quasiparticles ( `` normal '' fluid ) with group velocity @xmath12 from the excitations of phase ( or @xmath13- ) quantums .",
    "such conversion occurs only if the erenkov condition , @xmath14 for the energy @xmath15 and momentum @xmath16 of the @xmath13-excitation is satisfied .",
    "this phenomenon in superconductivity is also called landau damping since its equivalent in the plasma theory was originally obtained by landau ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    to emphasize the difference between the landau damping for @xmath1- and @xmath0-wave pairing",
    ", we also derive for the comparison the corresponding terms for a 2d @xmath1-wave superconductor .",
    "in addition we compare 2d expressions obtained here with the 3d @xmath1-wave case studied in @xcite .",
    "the collective phase oscillations in charged @xmath0-wave superconductor for clean and dirty cases were recently studied in @xcite . due to the complexity of the corresponding equations they were solved numerically , neglecting damping of the phase excitations .",
    "thus our fully analytical treatment can be very useful for further studies of the phase excitations .",
    "we also mention a recent paper @xcite where the effective action for the phase mode in the @xmath0-wave superconductor was obtained using the cumulant expansion .",
    "the landau terms were neglected in @xcite , but the effect of coulomb interaction was taken into account .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows .",
    "we find that the main physical difference between the @xmath1- and @xmath0-wave cases is related to the fact that for @xmath0-wave superconductivity the direction of the quasiparticle group velocity @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the quasiparticle dispersion law ) does not coincide with the fermi velocity @xmath19 @xcite and a gap velocity @xmath20 also enters into the erenkov condition along with @xmath19 .",
    "we show that the intensity of the landau damping has a linear temperature dependence at low @xmath10 with a coefficient expressed in terms of the anisotropy @xmath21 of the dirac spectrum @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) are the projections of the quasiparticle momentum on the directions perpendicular ( parallel ) to the fermi surface .",
    "the parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 proved to be very convenient both in the theory , for example , of the transport phenomena @xcite , ultrasonic attenuation @xcite in @xmath0-wave superconductors and for the analysis of various experiments @xcite .",
    "we find that the landau damping is sensitive to the direction of the phason momentum .",
    "in particular , for a given node the landau damping is possible only if the components of the phason momentum @xmath28 ( which are defined exactly as the components of the quasiparticle momentum above ) satisfy the condition @xmath29 .",
    "we derive a simple approximate representation for the landau damping terms which can be useful for further studies of the @xmath0-wave superconductors .",
    "we derive an approximate expression for the propagator of the bogolyubov - anderson mode which includes the landau damping .",
    "concerning the mathematical formalism used in the paper , we adapt the bilocal hubbard - stratonovich field method of @xcite to the @xmath0-wave pairing .",
    "additionally we adjust the technique of the derivative expansion for the `` phase only '' action ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) for the model with the tight - binding spectrum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] we present our model and write down the partition function using a bilocal hubbard - stratonovich field . in section  [ sec :",
    "action ] , we introduce the modulus - phase variables and represent the effective `` phase only '' action as an infinite series .",
    "it appears that the low - energy phase dynamics is contained in the first two terms which are evaluated , respectively , in sections  [ sec : first.tr ] and [ sec : second.tr ] with some details considered in appendix  [ sec : a ] .",
    "the effective lagrangians for the @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave cases without the landau damping are discussed in section  [ sec : local.action ] . in section",

    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] presents our conclusions and comments on a possible experimental observation of the phase excitations .",

    "it is important to stress that since the real systems are _ charged _ this mode appears to be different from the sound - like bogolyubov - anderson mode which exists in a _",
    "neutral _ superfluid fermi liquid .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite ( see also @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) the discovery of carlson - goldman collective mode @xcite overcame the widespread opinion that the bogolyubov - anderson collective oscillations predicted for a neutral superfluid should be forced to the frequencies on the order of the plasma frequency .",
    "it appears that if under certain conditions the frequency of the phase excitations is sufficiently low , the normal electron fluid may screen completely the associated electric field , thereby making the theory of uncharged superconductor applicable @xcite .",
    "the conditions for screening and occurrence of the carlson - goldman mode in @xmath1-wave superconductors are favorable only if the systems are dirty ( to suppress the landau damping ) and @xmath365 @xcite . as recently claimed in @xcite in @xmath0-wave superconductors the conditions appear to much less strict , so that the carlson - goldman mode may be observed in the clean systems for @xmath10 down to @xmath366 .",
    "now there are some new questions which would be interesting to address from both experimental and theoretical points of view .",
    "first of all , there is a general question whether the carlson - goldman mode which is the equivalent of the goldstone mode for the charged system can be observed experimentally .",
    "there are also a lot of theoretical questions which study would make this kind of experiment possible .",
    "leaving aside the specific of the carlson - goldman mode studied in @xcite we mention some of them which are directly related to the present work .",
    "the carlson - goldman experiment @xcite measures so called dynamical structure factor .",
    "this factor has a peak associated with the phase excitations the width of which is primarily controlled by the landau damping .",
    "therefore our result that the intensity of landau damping has a strong directional dependence should be taken into account in the calculation of the structure factor .",
    "in particular , the lowest for the observation of the carlson - goldman mode temperature @xmath367 in @xcite is obtained for the nodal direction .",
    "as can be seen from , for example , fig.[fig:4 ] and [ fig:5 ] , the corresponding landau damping terms become maximal in the vicinity of this direction which should likely result in widening of the corresponding peak .",
    "if this widening is too big that the peak may become unobservable , this would again suggest that the dirty samples should be used for the experiment .",
    "\\2 . taking into account the lattice effects and the dominance of the nodal excitations",
    "we have obtained that the velocity of the phase excitations at @xmath313 is given by @xmath368 ( see eq .",
    "( [ bktmode.d ] ) and the discussion after eq .",

    "the estimates of the velocities @xmath370 and @xmath371 obtained from the values @xmath372 and @xmath27 @xcite are presented in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "it is seen from these estimates that the difference between the description proceeding from continuum and lattice models can be quite different .",
    "however the estimates of the minimal for the observation of the carlson - goldman mode temperature in @xcite are based on the continuum expression @xmath369 .",
    "thus it would be interesting to reconsider these estimates for the lattice case .",
    "finally , as pointed out in @xcite if the plasmon is at finite frequency at @xmath373 , the landau damping does not occur since when @xmath15 is finite and @xmath373 it is impossible to satisfy erenkov condition discussed above .",
    "however , a very small value of the plasma frequency in htsc suggests that the landau damping may still be relevant when @xmath16 is nonzero and the erenkov condition can be satisfied .",
    "thus the corresponding damping terms should be included in the `` phase only '' actions which are used to describe plasma excitations in @xmath0-wave superconductors . predicted anisotropy of the landau damping would result in the damping anisotropy for the plasma excitations .    to summarize",
    ", we have considered the `` phase only '' effective action for so called _ neutral ( or uncharged ) _ fermionic superfluid with @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave pairing in 2d . when the damping terms are included into this action",
    ", it turns out non - local in coordinate space and its analytical structure for the @xmath0-wave case is very different from the @xmath1-wave case . to consider a charged superfluid it is necessary to combine the approaches used in the present paper and in @xcite to consider the landau damping in the presence of coulomb interaction .",
