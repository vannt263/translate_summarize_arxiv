    "the number of detected cool white dwarfs has risen dramatically with the advent of the deep all - sky surveys , like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "nonetheless , certain classes of white dwarfs  for example , ultracool white dwarfs and halo white dwarfs  remain intrinsically scarce .",
    "the first ultracool ( @xmath4k ) white dwarfs were discovered by  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "molecular hydrogen in their atmospheres causes a high opacity at infrared wavelengths , producing a spectral energy distribution with depleted infrared flux  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "six ultracool white dwarfs have already been found in the sdss on the basis of their unusual colours and spectral shape  @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite used a combination of sdss photometry and united states naval observatory ` b ' ( usno - b ) astrometry to double the still tiny sample of these interesting objects , which probe the earliest star formation in the galactic disk .",
    "the halo white dwarfs are of astronomical interest as probes of the earliest star formation in the proto - galaxy , and as tests of the age of the oldest stars .",
    "@xcite first identified six candidate halo white dwarfs on the basis of high proper motions .",
    "subsequently , @xcite claimed the discovery of 38 high proper motion white dwarfs , but it is unclear whether they are halo or thick disk members  @xcite . @xcite",
    "recently identified a sample of @xmath5 cool white dwarfs from sdss data release 3 ( dr3 ) using reduced proper motions , based on sdss and usno - b combined data  @xcite .",
    "the sample included 33 objects with substantial tangential velocity components ( @xmath6 160 kms@xmath7 ) and so are excellent halo white dwarf candidates .    in this paper",
    ", we also use sdss data to identify new members of the cool white dwarf population .",

    "we build a clean reduced proper motion diagram , from which we identify 1049 cool white dwarfs up to a magnitude @xmath8 .",
    "further diagnostic information is obtained by combining the catalogue with near - infrared photometry from the ukirt infrared digital sky survey ( ukidss ) data release 2 ( dr2 ) @xcite .",
    "this enables us to present new , faint samples of the astronomically important ultracool white dwarfs and halo white dwarfs .    ]",
    "sdss is an imaging and spectroscopic survey  @xcite that has mapped more than a quarter of the sky .",
    "imaging data are produced simultaneously in five photometric bands , namely @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the data are processed through pipelines to measure photometric and astrometric properties  @xcite .",
    "sdss stripe 82 covers a @xmath14deg@xmath15 area of sky , consisting of a @xmath16 strip along the celestial equator from right ascension @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "the stripe has been repeatedly imaged between june and december each year from 1998 to 2005 .",
    "sixty - two of the total of 134 available imaging runs were obtained in 2005 .",
    "this multi - epoch 5-filter photometric data set has been utilised by  @xcite to construct the light - motion - curve catalogue ( lmcc ) and the higher - level catalogue ( hlc ) .",
    "the lmcc contains 3700548 light - motion curves , extending to magnitude 21.5 in @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and to magnitude 20.5 in @xmath13 .",
    "a typical light - motion curve consists of @xmath1930 epochs over a baseline of 67 years .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) scatter in the individual position measurements is @xmath20 in each coordinate for @xmath21 , increasing exponentially to @xmath22 at @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the hlc includes 235 derived quantities , such as mean magnitudes , photometric variability parameters and proper - motion , for each light - motion curve in the lmcc . as an illustration of the catalogue s potential , fig .",
    "[ fig : pm ] shows a measured proper motion in ra and dec for sdss j224845.93005407.0 , one of the ultracool white dwarf candidates extracted from the lmcc .",

    "ukidss is the ukirt infrared deep sky survey  @xcite , carried out using the wide field camera  @xcite installed on the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) .",
    "the survey is now well underway with three eso - wide releases : the early data release ( edr ) in february 2006  @xcite , the data release 1 ( dr1 ) in july 2006  @xcite and the data release 2 in march 2007  @xcite .",
    "in fact ukidss is made up of five surveys . the ukidss large area survey ( las )",

    ", our hlc for stripe 82 enables us to construct an rpm diagram using only sdss data .",
    "magnitudes used in the rpm diagram are mean magnitudes , calculated from all available single epoch sdss measurements .",
    "these values therefore differ from magnitudes quoted in the publicly available sdss database which are based on a single photometric measurement .",
    "differences are usually small , of the order of some hundredths of a magnitude",
    ". typical proper motion errors in right ascension and declination are @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 which is slightly better than that of  @xcite despite the much shorter time baseline used for calculating proper motions in the hlc . additionally , the shorter time baseline with many position measurements has the advantage of reducing the contamination due to mismatches of objects with larger proper motions .",
    "the stripe 82 photometric catalogue extends approximately @xmath36 mag deeper than the sdss - dr2/usno - b catalogue , corresponding to a factor of two in distance .",
    "taking into account the different sky coverage of the two catalogues , the resultant volume over which white dwarfs may be detected in the hlc is @xmath37per cent of that accessible in the sdss - dr2/usno - b catalogue .    in the left panel of fig .",

    "this @xmath41 statistic follows a chi - square distribution with two degrees of freedom .",
    "a relatively high @xmath46 threshold was adopted in order to keep distinct stellar populations in the rpm diagram cleanly separated .",
    "the object sample was then matched with the ukidss dr2 catalogue using a search radius of 40 .",
    "approximately 70per cent of the sample had at least one near - infrared detection .",
    "the unmatched fraction results from a combination of the incomplete coverage of stripe 82 in the ukidss dr2 and a proportion of the faintest sdss objects possessing infrared magnitudes below the ukidss las detection limits .        the left panel of fig .",

    "[ fig : rpm ] ) .",
    "446 of the white dwarf candidates possess at least one detection in the near - infrared ukidss dr2 .",

    "the population of white dwarfs is not too sensitive to the precise details of the separation boundary adopted . in this border region",
    "a small contamination from the subdwarfs is still possible  @xcite .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cc ] we show the overlap in colour space between the cooler end of the white dwarf locus with the main sequence star locus .",
    "one can see that it is impossible to distinguish cooler white dwarfs from the main sequence stars based on colour information only and proper motions for these cool objects are needed .",
    "the effectiveness of our rpm selection is evident from the location of 429 spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs from a number of sources  @xcite in the right panels of fig .",

    "[ fig : cc ] .",
    "the previously confirmed white dwarfs populate practically only the upper half of the white dwarf sequence in the rpm diagram and the hotter end of the white dwarf locus in the colour - colour diagram .",
    "confirmed cooler white dwarfs are rare and almost all originate from  @xcite where a similar detection method was adopted .",
    "the hlc is the faintest existing photometric / astrometric catalogue which enables us to trace hotter and thus intrinsically brighter white dwarfs to further distances and also to significantly enlarge the number of known cooler and thus intrinsically fainter white dwarfs .",

    "in reality the @xmath56 values for white dwarfs range from @xmath57 to @xmath58 and the tangential velocities in the disk span from @xmath59 to @xmath60 which results in a strong overlap between different model loci . because of this degeneracy it is impossible to determine unique white dwarf physical properties only from their positions in the rpm diagram . in the colour - colour diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : cc_candidates ] the model loci for pure h and he atmosphere white dwarfs are plotted for a range of log g values  @xcite .",

    "colour differences are well measurable only at the very cool end of the model tracks .",
    "this holds for white dwarfs with either h or he atmospheres .",
    "it is also not obviously feasible to distinguish between the h and he atmosphere white dwarfs . in some parts of the parameter space",
    "there is complete degeneracy .      in order to compare the available magnitude information for each white dwarf candidate with the best matching model  @xcite , a minimal normalised @xmath61 value was calculated : @xmath62 where @xmath63 are measured magnitudes for a given object , @xmath64 its corresponding model predictions and @xmath65 measured magnitude errors calculation . ] .",
    "the best solution was sought on a grid of three free parameters , namely effective surface temperature ( @xmath66 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath67 ) and distance modulus ( @xmath68 ) . for each of the 1049 white dwarf candidates",
    "the four sdss magnitudes , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , were used in the fit .",
    "whenever any of the ukidss magnitudes were available the fit was repeated with this additional information included .",
    "only a small subset of 70 white dwarf candidates have as yet all three @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 ukidss magnitudes measured ukidss magnitude was not included in the @xmath61 analysis due to the lack of white dwarf models for this waveband . ] .",
    "both h and he atmosphere models were compared with the data . in the attempt to better understand the degeneracy effects the best and also the second best solutions were recorded .",
    "the statistical analysis of the obtained normalised @xmath61 results was performed first on the complete white dwarf sample , using only sdss magnitude information . in all cases",
    "the @xmath61 distributions are strongly asymmetric",
    ". typically fits of the h models perform better than the he ones . for the h models the normalised @xmath61 distribution peaks at @xmath72 and",
    "has a width of @xmath73 while for the he models the distribution peak is at @xmath74 and the width is @xmath75 .",
    "differences between the two fits are however usually too small to clearly distinguish between the two , especially in the temperature range where the h and he models are degenerate .",
    "white dwarf atmosphere models observed in broad - band colours are also degenerate for different surface gravity values . in order to estimate",
    "how strongly this degeneracy affects the results of the fit we compared the calculated best normalised @xmath61 solutions with the second best ones . from the differences in the calculated @xmath61 values it is usually not possible to completely discard the second best solution .",
    "for instance , in the h model case , the second best normalised @xmath61 distribution peaks at @xmath73 with a distribution width of @xmath73 . nevertheless , for @xmath76per cent of the white dwarf candidates both best and second best solution predict the same effective temperature . for the remaining white dwarfs both",
    "temperatures usually differ from each other only by @xmath77per cent , which typically corresponds to two adjacent bins on the discrete grid of available models .",
    "available photometric information is thus sufficient to reliably estimate the white dwarf effective temperature .",
    "not surprisingly , the fit results of the surface gravity ( and as a consequence also distance ) are much less certain .",
    "the typical @xmath67 difference between the best and second best solution lies in the range from 0.5 to 1.5 .",
    "we used the subsample of 70 white dwarfs with complete ukidss photometry available to show how the ukidss data improve the constraints on the model fits .",
    "the normalised @xmath61 of the fit using the complete sdss and ukidss magnitude information is typically smaller by 0.5 than the value from the fit using sdss data only . in @xmath78per cent of the cases",
    "the temperature predictions are the same , otherwise the difference is only one step on the model temperature grid , which confirms the reliability of the temperature estimation . moreover , in @xmath78per cent of the cases also the surface gravity solutions are the same and in the remaining @xmath79per cent of the cases the best sdss+ukidss solution often corresponds to the second best sdss solution .",
    "this might indicate that the ukidss data help in breaking the degeneracy in the @xmath67 parameter .",
    "when this is not the case , the normalised @xmath61 are always larger ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "70 white dwarfs is still too small a number to draw definite conclusions , however , it seems that the inclusion of the ukidss data significantly enhances the credibility of the photometric fits",
    ". this will be very important in the near future , when it will be possible to match large portions of the sdss / usno - b measurements with the rapidly increasing las ukidss database .",
    "the signature of an ultracool surface temperature ( @xmath4k ) is depleted infrared flux , which makes the ir ukidss measurements crucial for the recognition of the ultracool white dwarf candidates .",
    "unfortunately only a small subsample of the 1049 white dwarfs have at least one ukidss measurement available as yet .",
    "that is why we first examined the outcome of the h and he atmosphere model fits performed on the complete white dwarf sample , using sdss magnitude information only .",
    "if the calculated surface temperature was smaller than @xmath81 and the normalised @xmath61 value of the fit was @xmath82 the object was added to the ultracool white dwarf candidate list . in the subsample of white dwarfs with at least one ukidss measurement this additional piece of information",
    "was then used as a confirmation or rejection of potential ultracool white dwarf candidates .",
    "typically the sdss and ukidss predictions agreed .",
    "the results of this analysis , graphically presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : rpm_candidates ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : cc_candidates ] , are the following :    * 9 ultracool white dwarf candidates with h - rich atmosphere among which 7 have at least one supportive ukidss measurement .",
    "the object sdss j224206.19@xmath83004822.7 has already been spectroscopically confirmed as a dc type white dwarf ( no strong spectral lines present , consistent with an h or he atmosphere ) by  @xcite with a measured surface temperature of @xmath84k .",
    "the object sdss j233055.19@xmath83002852.2 has been spectroscopically confirmed also as a dc type white dwarf by the same authors .",
    "its measured surface temperature is @xmath85k which is just above the ultracool limit .",
    "* one ultracool white dwarf candidate based on sdss photometry only with he - rich atmosphere . * 14 possible h - rich ultracool white dwarf candidates .",
    "for these candidates the fit of the he atmosphere model gives in fact a slightly better result , predicting as a consequence an object with not so extremely low surface temperature .",
    "taking into account small differences between the h and he colours and the fact that h - rich white dwarfs are in fact much more numerous than the he - rich ones , makes these 14 objects still serious ultracool white dwarf candidates .",
    "the object sdss j232115.67@xmath83010223.8 has been spectroscopically confirmed as a dc type white dwarf by  @xcite .",
    "this object is also the only one where the fit based on only sdss magnitudes did not predict an ultracool temperature but the inclusion of the ukidss k magnitude revealed the presence of the depleted ir flux .",
    "there are three additional ultracool candidates with at least one confirmed ukidss measurement .    based on the positions in the rpm diagram and on the estimated tangential velocities , we conclude that the vast majority of the newly discovered ultracool white dwarf candidates are likely members of the disk population . measured and calculated properties of the 24 ultracool white dwarf candidates",
    "are presented in table  [ tab : ultra ] . due to the relatively large temperature errors , estimated to be at least @xmath86 ( the model temperature resolution in this temperature range )",
    ", some of the 24 candidates might be in reality just above the ultracool white dwarf limit .",
    "we also do not quote the fit results for the surface gravity since these are as explained above too uncertain .",
    "it is possible that some of the new ultracool white dwarf candidates close to the adopted boundary are subdwarfs instead .",
    "all these open issues can be ultimately resolved only with spectroscopic follow up . however , already by analyzing the sdss and ukidss astrometric / photometric information",
    ", it is certain that the total number of known ultracool white dwarfs has at least doubled .",
    "@xcite present a sample of 33 halo white dwarf candidates from their study employing the sdss dr3 and usno - b catalogues . the combination of their larger sky coverage and brighter magnitude limit of @xmath87 results in a survey volume three times that of our stripe 82 survey .    here",
    "we adopt the same criteria of @xmath88 as @xcite to select halo white dwarf candidates using the results of the model fit .",
    "unfortunately , white dwarf atmosphere models  @xcite are degenerate for different values of the @xmath56 parameter in a broad temperature range . this uncertainty in the calculation of the surface gravity",
    "is coupled with the determination of the distance to the object .",
    "solutions with larger surface gravity and smaller distances are strongly coupled with those with smaller surface gravity and greater distance . as a consequence determination of the tangential velocity",
    "is also somewhat uncertain .",
    "therefore we divide our halo white dwarf candidates , presented in table  [ tab : halo ] and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rpm_candidates ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : cc_candidates ] , into two groups :    * white dwarfs where the best and also second best fit solution indicate a quickly moving object .",
    "12 highly probable halo candidates were thus found .",
    "four were already previously spectroscopically observed  @xcite and two of them , namely sdss j010207.24@xmath89003259.7 and sdss j234110.13@xmath83003259.5 were already included on the  @xcite halo candidate list .",
    "* white dwarfs where the best fit solution gives @xmath88 but the second best fit solution does not .",
    "22 white dwarfs were thus found and very likely not all of them are halo white dwarfs .",
    "12 were already previously spectroscopically observed by  @xcite    one of the ultracool white dwarf candidates , sdss j030144.09@xmath89004439.5 has its calculated tangential velocity just below the threshold limit and could be thus also a member of the halo population .",
    "@xcite used the multi - epoch sdss observations of stripe 82 to build the deepest ( complete to @xmath90 ) photometric / astrometric catalogue ever constructed , covering @xmath14deg@xmath15 of the sky . here , we have exploited the catalogue to find new candidate members of scarce white dwarf sub - populations .",
    "we extracted the stellar objects with high signal - to - noise ratio proper motions and built a rpm diagram .",
    "cleanly separated from the subdwarf populations in the rpm diagram are 1049 cool white dwarf candidates .    amongst these , we identified at least 7 new ultracool h - rich white dwarf candidates , in addition to one already spectroscopically confirmed by  @xcite and one new ultracool he - rich white dwarf candidate .",
    "the effective temperatures @xmath91 of these eight candidates are all @xmath924000k .",
