    "there are only three completely symmetric triangulations of the sphere : the tetrahedron , the octahedron and the icosahedron .",
    "however , finer triangulations with good geometric properties are often encountered or desired for mathematical , scientific or technological reasons , for example , the kinds of triangulations popularized in modern times by buckminster fuller and used for geodesic domes and chemical ` buckyballs ' .",
    "there are procedures to refine and modify any triangulation of a surface until every vertex has either 5 , 6 or 7 triangles around it , or with more effort , so that there are only 5 or 6 triangles if the surface has positive euler characteristic , only 6 triangles if the surface has zero euler characteristic , or only 6 or 7 triangles if the surface has negative euler characteristic . these conditions on triangulations are combinatorial analogues of metrics of positive , zero or negative curvature .",
    "how systematically can they be understood ?    in this paper , we will develop a global theory to describe all triangulations of the @xmath4 such that each vertex has @xmath3 or fewer triangles at any vertex . here",
    "is one description :    [ polyhedra are lattice points ] there is a lattice @xmath5 in complex lorentz space @xmath6 and a group @xmath7 of automorphisms , such that triangulations of non - negative combinatorial curvature are elements of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the set of lattice points of positive square - norm .",
    "the projective action of @xmath7 on complex hyperbolic space @xmath10 ( the unit ball in @xmath11 ) has quotient of finite volume .",
    "the square of the norm of a lattice point is the number of triangles in the triangulation .",
    "a triangulation is _ non - negatively curved _ if there are never more than six triangles at a vertex .",
    "the theorem can be interpreted as describing certain concrete cut - and - glue constructions for creating triangulations of non - negative curvature , starting from simple and easily - classified examples .",
    "the constructions are parametrized by choices of integers , subject to certain geometric constraints .",
    "the fact that @xmath7 is a discrete group means that it is possible to dispense with most of the constraints , except for an algebraic condition that a certain quadratic form is positive : any choice of integer parameters can be transformed by @xmath7 to satisfy the geometric conditions , and the resulting triangulation is unique .",
    "thus , the collection of all triangulations can be described either as a quotient space , in which identifications of the parameters are made algebraically , or as a fundamental domain ( see section [ section : construction and fundamental domain ] ) .    1 in   cone angle @xmath12    we will study combinatorial types of triangulations by using a metric where each triangle is a euclidean equilateral triangle with sides of unit length .",
    "this metric is locally euclidean everywhere except near vertices that have fewer than @xmath3 triangles .",
    "it is helpful to consider these metrics as a special case of metrics on the sphere which are locally euclidean except at a finite number of points , which have neighborhoods locally modelled on cones .",
    "a _ cone of cone - angle @xmath12 _ is a metric space that can be formed , if @xmath13 , from a sector of the euclidean plane between two rays that make an angle @xmath12 , by gluing the two rays together .",
    "more generally , a cone of angle @xmath12 can be formed by taking the universal cover of the plane minus @xmath14 , reinserting @xmath14 , and then identifying modulo a transformation that `` rotates '' by angle @xmath12 .",
    "the _ apex curvature _ of a cone of cone - angle @xmath12 is @xmath15 .",
    "a euclidean cone metric on a surface satisfies the gauss  bonnet theorem , that is , the sum of the apex curvatures is @xmath0 times the euler characteristic .",
    "this fact can be derived from basic euclidean geometry by subdividing the surface into triangles and looking at the sum of angles of all triangles grouped in two different ways , by triangle or by vertex .",
    "it can also be derived from the usual smooth gauss  bonnet formula by rounding off the points , replacing a tiny neighborhood of each cone point by a smooth surface ( for example part of a small sphere ) .",
    "[ cone metrics form cone - manifold ] let @xmath16 $ ] be a collection of real numbers in the interval @xmath17 whose sum is @xmath18 .",
    "then the set of euclidean cone metrics on the sphere with cone points of curvature @xmath19 and of total area @xmath20 forms a complex hyperbolic manifold , whose metric completion is a complex hyperbolic cone manifold of finite volume .",
    "this cone manifold is an orbifold ( that is , the quotient space of a discrete group ) if and only if for any pair @xmath21 whose sum @xmath22 that is less than @xmath0 , either    ( i ) : :    @xmath23 divides @xmath0 , or ( ii ) : :    @xmath24 , and @xmath25    divides @xmath0 .    the definition of `` cone - manifold '' in dimensions bigger than @xmath26 will be given later .",
    "this turns out to be closely related to work of picard ( @xcite , @xcite ) and mostow and deligne ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "picard discovered many of the orbifolds ; his student levavasseur enumerated the class of groups picard discovered , and they were further analyzed by deligne and mostow .",
    "mostow discovered that condition ( i ) is not always required to obtain an orbifold and that ( ii ) is sufficient when @xmath24 .",
    "however , the geometric interpretations were not apparent in these papers .",
    "it is possible to understand the quotient cone - manifolds quite concretely in terms of shapes of polyhedra .",
    "a version of this paper has circulated for a number of years as a preprint , which for a time was circulated as a geometry center preprint , and later revised as part of the xxx mathematics archive . in view of this history ,",

    "we give below a list of the examples of the spaces @xmath219 which are orbifolds , for @xmath440 .",
    "when @xmath441 there is only one example for each feasible triple of cone angles , and for @xmath442 there are infinitely many examples .",
    "in fact , every triangle group in the hyperbolic plane can be interpreted as the modular space for families of tetrahedra . in general , the @xmath140 are of the form @xmath443 , for @xmath159 and @xmath169 integers . for each example",
    ", we list the least denominator @xmath169 and the sequence of numerators @xmath44 .",
    "we also list the degree of the number field containing the roots of unity @xmath444 ( that is , the number of integers less than @xmath169 relatively prime to @xmath169 ) .",
    "we list also three additional bits of information :    ( arithmetic ) : :    is the orbifold arithmetic ( ar ) or non - arithmetic ( nr ) ?",
    "( pure ) : :    is the completion of the covering of the modular space whose    fundamental group is the pure braid group an orbifold ( p ) , or are some    interchanges of pairs of cone points needed to make the orbifold ( i ) ? ( compact ) : :    is the orbifold compact ( c ) or non - compact ( n ) ?",
    "the question of arithmeticity hinges on the signatures of the hermitian forms obtained when we conjugate the curvatures at the cone points ( considered as roots of unity ) by the galois automorphisms .",
    "if all the other signatures are negative definite or positive definite , the group is arithmetic ; otherwise not .",
    "the other two questions are more obvious .",
    "these examples were enumerated by a routine computer program , which checks all possibilities having a given least common denominator @xmath169 .",
    "the enumeration was not rigorously verified ( even though it should not be hard to do so and search more ` intelligently ' at the same time ) but was a simple check of all denominators through @xmath445 in a few minutes of computer time .",
    "mostow has rigorously enumerated examples by hand , so this table can be regarded as just a check ."
