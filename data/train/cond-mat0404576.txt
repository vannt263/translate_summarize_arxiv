    "the mott - hubbard model of interacting bosons on a lattice has been used to describe superfluid mott - insulator transitions in a variety of systems , e.g. , josephson arrays and granular superconductors @xcite .",
    "the recent suggestion @xcite to experimentally observe this transition in a system of cold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice and its successful experimental demonstration @xcite has rekindled the interest in the mott - insulator transition and triggered a great deal of theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite activity . the possibility to directly manipulate and test the many - body behavior of a system of",
    "trapped bosonic atoms in an optical lattice @xcite is very attractive .",
    "possible applications include the use of a mott state of bosonic atoms in an optical lattice as a starting point to create controlled multiparticle entanglement as an essential ingredient for quantum computation @xcite    the mott - insulator quantum phase transition is driven by the interplay of the repulsive interaction of bosons on the same lattice site and the kinetic energy .",
    "hence the ratio of the onsite energy and the bandwidth forms the key parameter in the system . in optical lattices , this parameter can be easily controlled and varied by several orders of magnitude , enabling detailed studies of the quantum phase transition .",
    "probing the system by taking absorption pictures to image the expansion patterns after a reasonable expansion time yields information about the momentum distribution of the state .",
    "this procedure was used to experimentally confirm the mott transition in an optical lattice @xcite .    the essential physics of cold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice is captured by a bosonic mott - hubbard model describing the competition between hopping and on - site interaction .",
    "a number of approximation schemes have been used to study this model analytically @xcite as well as numerically , using approaches like the gutzwiller mean - field ansatz @xcite , density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite , exact diagonalization ( ed)@xcite and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) @xcite .    in this article , we study the short - range correlations , not included by the gutzwiller ansatz , by using perturbation theory . the main purpose is to find corrections to the short - range behavior of the one - particle density matrix , which is directly relevant to experimentally observed expansion patterns .",
    "these patterns are important for determining the location of the insulator - superfluid transition .",
    "we note that in the insulating state our perturbative approach is identical to the one used in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , although there the goal was different , viz . , studying corrections to the phase diagram .",
    "the remainder of the article is organized as follows : in section [ modsec ] , we will introduce the model and its mean - field solution . the general perturbative approach is briefly outlined in section [ secpa ] , while details may be found in the appendix .",
    "numerical results are presented and discussed in section [ secnr ] , first for local observables ( [ secslso ] ) and then for the density matrix ( [ secrho ] ) .",

    "the kinetic term includes only hopping between nearest - neighbor sites , this is denoted by the summation index @xmath8 ; @xmath9 is the hopping matrix element that we will assume to be lattice - site independent .",
    "finally , @xmath10 describes an external on - site potential that is commonly present in experiments .",
    "the gutzwiller ( gw ) approach is based on an ansatz for the many - body ground state that factorizes into single lattice - site wavefunctions @xmath11    the gutzwiller wavefunction represents the ground state of the following mean - field version of the mott - hubbard hamiltonian , eq .",

    "using the gutzwiller ansatz to obtain an approximate variational solution for the mott - hubbard hamiltonian ( [ motthubb ] ) corresponds , however , to restricting the hilbert space to the subset of product states .",
    "consequently , even in higher dimensions , this ansatz fails to describe the correct behavior of short - range correlations between different lattice sites , which are important for experimentally measurable observables , such as expansion patterns ( momentum distributions ) . nevertheless , in the thermodynamic limit and higher dimensions , the gutzwiller wavefunction provides a good approximation in the limits of @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( i.e. , deep in the mott insulator ( mi ) and superfluid ( sf ) phases ) .",
    "to get a satisfactory description of the short - range correlations we will now derive perturbative corrections to the gutzwiller mean - field result .",
    "our aim is to start from the gutzwiller approximation and improve it by perturbatively including the short - range correlations between lattice sites .",

    "short - range correlations are not reproduced by the gutzwiller approach .",
    "this deviation is particularly severe in the mi , where the mean - field result predicts a completely flat momentum distribution , whereas the short - range correlations ( i.e. the exponential decay of @xmath51 ) yield smooth bumps in the expansion pattern . these can be distinguished from the @xmath66-peaks of the sf only after a sufficiently long expansion time .",

    "indeed , we find a nice agreement between perturbation theory and exact results , not only for the mi ( see fig .",
    "[ vgled]a ) , but also for the short - range behavior in the sf .",

    "( [ perta ] ) are the second - order corrections to the mean value .      as an example we will discuss the corrections to the density matrix @xmath121 .",
    "the first - order correction to the density matrix is : @xmath122 for two different lattice sites @xmath123 , we find @xmath124 since the gutzwiller ground state is a product state . as a consequence ,",
    "the contributions @xmath125 and @xmath126 vanish .",
    "the only remaining contributions to @xmath127 stem from @xmath128 and @xmath129 .      the graph shows a decomposition of the matrix element , with each row showing the wavefunction at an intermediate step in the evaluation of the matrix element .",
    "as we deal with product states @xmath130 we represent the wavefunction by a row of circles , where each circle denotes the state @xmath131 of a particular lattice site @xmath4 .",
    "open circles in fig .",
    "[ diagramm ] denote a lattice site in its ground state ( gs ) , filled circles refer to an excited state ( es ) of this particular lattice site , with respect to the local mean - field hamiltonian .",
    "note that , in general , this can be an arbitrarily highly excited state ( although higher contributions are suppressed by the energy denominator , and a cutoff is used in practice ) .",
    "starting with a row of open circles , denoting the gs , @xmath116 , each following row corresponds to the state after the action of @xmath25 or @xmath132 , as indicated on the left side of the graph . as all matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ perta ] ) can be expressed in terms of a gs expectation value @xmath115 and a sequence of @xmath25 and @xmath132 operators , the first and last row must always be a line of open circles .",
    "let us consider for instance the second term in eq .",
    "( [ firstorder ] ) @xmath133 reading the graph in fig .",
    "[ diagramm ] from top to bottom corresponds to reading the matrix element from right to left .",
    "starting with the gs , @xmath134 , the first row consists of open circles .",
    "the second row shows the state after the action of the perturbation @xmath25 .",
    "acting with @xmath135 to the right onto the gs results in a state latexmath:[\\[v_{ij } |g_0\\rangle = \\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta } f_{\\alpha,\\beta }    @xmath112 are neighboring lattice sites and @xmath137 denotes the state with lattice site @xmath4 ( @xmath112 ) in the exited state @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) and all other sites in their gs .",
    "thus the second row shows the lattice sites @xmath4 and @xmath140 in an excited state ( filled circle ) , as the perturbation , eq .",
    "( [ pert ] ) , allows only next neighbor interactions .",
    "finally , the action of @xmath132 has to bring the excited states back to the gs , in order to get a non - vanishing contribution .",
    "therefore , in first order pt , only next neighbor corrections to the correlation function arise , as the final row must represent the ground state @xmath141 again .",
