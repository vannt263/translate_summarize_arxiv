    "the stationary stochastic processes may be also introduced in the following , alternative , way .",

    "let @xmath30 be a sub-@xmath12-algebra of @xmath31 satisfying @xmath32 .",
    "we then define the non - decreasing filtration @xmath33 by @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath35 be a random variable which is @xmath36-measurable .",
    "we define the stationary sequence @xmath37 by @xmath38 .    in this paper",
    ", we shall use both frameworks .    in order to analyze the asymptotic behavior of the partial sums @xmath39 gordin , in  @xcite , proposed to decompose the sums related to the original stationary sequence into the sum @xmath40 of a square - integrable martingale @xmath41 adapted to @xmath42 , whose martingale differences  @xmath43 are stationary , and a so - called coboundary @xmath44 , that is , a telescoping sum of random variables with the basic property that @xmath45 . more precisely , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is another stationary sequence in @xmath48 .",
    "the limiting properties of the martingales can then be transported from the martingale to the general sequence . in the context of markov chains , the existence of such",
    "a decomposition is equivalent to the solvability of the poisson equation in  @xmath48 .    for proving a central limit theorem for stationary sequences ,",
    "a weaker form of martingale approximation has been pointed out by many authors ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "recently , two interesting papers , one by dedecker , merlevde and voln @xcite and the other by zhao and woodroofe @xcite , provided necessary and sufficient conditions for martingale approximation with an error term in ( [ martaprox ] ) satisfying @xmath49 this decomposition is strong enough for transporting the conditional central limit theorem from sums of stationary martingale differences in @xmath48 to @xmath50 by conditional clt , as discussed in  @xcite , we understand , in this context , that for any continuous function @xmath51 such that @xmath52 is bounded and for any @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the standard normal density and @xmath56 is an invariant function satisfying @xmath57 here , and throughout the paper , we denote by @xmath58 the norm in @xmath59",

    "it is well known that a martingale with stationary differences in @xmath48 satisfies this type of behavior with @xmath72 in @xmath73  this is at the heart of many statistical procedures .",
    "this conditional form of the invariance principle is a stable type of convergence that makes possible the change of measure with another absolutely continuous measure , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "with such a result in mind , the question is now to find necessary and sufficient conditions for a martingale decomposition with the error term satisfying @xmath74    in order to state our martingale approximation result , for fixed @xmath75 , we consider the stationary sequence @xmath76 in the language of markov operators , we then have @xmath77 it is convenient to introduce a seminorm notation , namely,@xmath78 on the space of all @xmath79 with @xmath80    [ t][maxgencopy(2)]assume that @xmath81 is a stationary sequence of centered square - integrable random variables .",
    "then@xmath82 if and only if there exists a martingale with stationary increments satisfying ( [ maxcond ] ) . such a martingale is unique if it exists . in particular , ( [ max ] ) implies ( [ fclt ] ) .    as a consequence of the proof of theorem [ t ] , we also obtain the following result that adds a new equivalent condition to the characterizations by dedecker , merlevde and voln @xcite and zhao and woodroofe @xcite . with @xmath83",

    "such a martingale is unique if it exists . in particular , ( [ ma1 ] )",
    "implies ( [ clt ] ) .",
    "our approach is constructive .",
    "if the stationary sequence is supposed to be ergodic , then the constructed martingale differences are also ergodic and therefore the conditional theorems ( [ clt ] ) and ( [ fclt ] ) can be easily transported to the original processes satisfying ( [ ma1 ] ) and ( [ max ] ) , respectively , with @xmath86 .",
    "a natural and useful question is to provide classes of stochastic processes that have a martingale decomposition with an error term satisfying ( [ maxcond ] ) , in other words , to provide sharp sufficient conditions for such a decomposition .",
    "obviously , a maximal inequality is needed in order to verify this condition .",
    "we shall combine our approach with several maximal inequalities .",
    "one is due to rio @xcite , formula ( 3.9 ) , page 53 ; for related inequalities , see @xcite and @xcite .    * for any stationary process with centered variables in @xmath87 , @xmath88    another inequality comes from @xcite , proposition ( 2.3 ) ; see also @xcite , theorem 1 , for the inequality in @xmath59 .    * for any stationary process with centered variables in @xmath48 , @xmath89 \\\\[-8pt ] \\nonumber & \\leq & n\\biggl(2\\vert x_{0}\\vert_{2}+80\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\frac{\\vert \\mathbb{e}_{0}(s_{j})\\vert _ { 2}}{j^{3/2}}\\biggr)^{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90    the following maximal inequality is a particular case of dedecker and merlevde @xcite , proposition 6 ; see @xcite , theorem 1 , for the inequality in @xmath59 .",
    "* for any stationary process with centered variables in @xmath48 such that @xmath91 almost surely , we have@xmath92    another inequality we use for additive functionals of stationary reversible markov chains is a consequence of wu @xcite , corollary 2.7 and relation ( 2.5 ) in the same paper ( note that there is a typographical error in this relation , namely , a square should be added to the norm ) ; see also @xcite :    * assume @xmath93 is a stationary , reversible markov chain and @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "then , for every @xmath96,@xmath97 provided the series on the right - hand side is convergent .",
    "this inequality , originally stated for the ergodic case , extends without changes to the general case .    by combining the martingale decomposition in theorem [ t ] with these maximal inequalities ,",
    "we point out various classes of stochastic processes for which a conditional functional limit theorem holds . these include mixing processes and classes of markov chains .",
    "the proof of this theorem has several steps .    _ step construction of the approximating martingale_.    the construction of the martingale decomposition is based on averages .",
    "it was introduced by wu and woodroofe @xcite ( see their definition ( 6 ) on page 1677 ) and further developed in  @xcite , extending the construction in @xcite and @xcite ; see also @xcite , theorem 8.1 , and @xcite .",

    "the starting point is the construction of the martingale differences , as in ( [ martd ] ) . by the martingale property and ( [ deco ] ) , for all positive integers @xmath111 and @xmath112 , we have @xmath113 we now let @xmath114 by relation ( [ rest ] ) and stationarity , it follows that @xmath115 by ( [ max])@xmath116 the limit when @xmath117 and @xmath112 both tend to @xmath118 is then @xmath119 , giving that @xmath120 is cauchy in @xmath48 and therefore convergent .",
    "denote its limit by @xmath121 .",
    "then @xmath122 is a martingale with the desired properties . to see this , we start from the decomposition in relation ( martdec ) and obtain @xmath123 then@xmath124 by doob s maximal inequality for martingales and by stationarity",

    ". then @xmath152 first , note that by peligrad and utev @xcite , proposition 2.5 , we know that condition ( [ mw ] ) implies that @xmath153 we complete the proof by showing that @xmath154 since @xmath155 by the triangle inequality and stationarity , every term of the series on the right - hand side of the equality @xmath156 tends to @xmath119 as @xmath157 furthermore , because @xmath158 each term in @xmath159 is dominated by the corresponding term in @xmath160 , the latter being independent of @xmath75 .",
    "the result follows from the above considerations , along with the lebesgue dominated convergence theorem for the counting measure .    for the sake of applications , we give the following corollary .",

    "the fact that ( [ mixg1 ] ) implies ( [ mw ] ) was observed in maxwell and woodroofe @xcite .",
