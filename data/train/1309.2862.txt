    "entropy production rate is a crucial physical quantity in irreversible thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "this quantity can be expressed in a canonical form that is the sum of products of generalized thermodynamic fluxes and forces .",
    "when a system is in contact with two heat baths , the heat absorbed from one bath per unit time is equal to that released into another bath per unit time if no work exchange takes place between the system and the environment .",
    "thus the thermodynamic flux related to the heat transfer between two baths , which is briefly called the thermal flux , can be taken as either the absorbed heat or released heat per unit time within the framework of irreversible thermodynamics  @xcite . however , the absorbed heat is unequal to the released heat if the system ( for example , a heat engine or a refrigerator ) outputs or inputs mechanical work .",
    "therefore , we face a difficult circumstance when we construct the thermal flux for the heat engine or the refrigerator",
    ". there exists some arbitrariness when we choose either the absorbed heat or released heat per unit time as the thermal flux . to eliminate this arbitrariness , jarzynski and mazonka",
    "@xcite intuitively suggested adopting the mean value of the absorbed heat and released heat per unit time as the thermal flux when they discussed a simple , discrete model of the feynman ratchet operating between two heat baths .",
    "this convention was also followed by nakagawa and komatsu  @xcite when they discussed the feynman s ratchet as a heat pump .",
    "however , there is still a lack of a rigorous and systematic scheme to eliminate this arbitrariness .",
    "the other classic topic on nonequilibrium processes is finite - time thermodynamics  @xcite which is concerned mainly with the energy conversion efficiency for heat devices including heat engines and refrigerators that complete thermodynamic cycles in finite time or operate in finite net rate .",
    "the most celebrated result in the finite - time thermodynamics is the efficiency at maximum power output for endoreversible heat engines  @xcite , @xmath0 with @xmath1 representing the carnot efficiency .",
    "interestingly , the corresponding result was also obtained by yan and chen for endoreversible refrigerators  @xcite .",
    "they suggested taking the product of the coefficient of performance ( cop ) and the heat absorbed by the working substance from the cold bath per unit time as the optimization target function , which was also called the @xmath2criterion by de toms _ et al .",
    "_ in recent work  @xcite .",
    "the cop at maximum @xmath2criterion was found to be @xmath3 for endoreversible refrigerators  @xcite or symmetrically low - dissipation refrigerators  @xcite , where @xmath4 represents the carnot cop for reversible refrigerators .",
    "the relationship between irreversible thermodynamics and finite - time thermodynamics was first realized by van den broeck  @xcite . in an elegant investigation on the efficiency at maximum power output for a heat engine",
    ", he adopted a generic model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - engwh](a ) and selected @xmath5 , the heat absorbed from the hot bath per unit time , as the thermal flux . under the assumption of local equilibrium for the heat engine",
    "such that the effective temperature of working substance can be well - defined , he found that the efficiency at maximum power output is @xmath6 up to the linear order for a tight - coupling heat engine within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics . in principle",
    ", one can also choose @xmath7 , the heat released into the cold bath per unit time , as the thermal flux . although the arbitrariness in selecting the thermal flux has no serious effect on the major results up to the lowest order for heat engines , this arbitrariness may lead to fatal consequences when we consider some optimization problems for refrigerators . for example , if we follow van den broeck s procedure in ref .",
    "@xcite and optimize refrigerators , the results of cop at maximum @xmath2criterion with taking @xmath7 or @xmath5 as the thermal flux are quite different from each other : one approaches 0 and the other approaches @xmath8 ( which takes a large value ) when the temperatures of two baths get close to one another ( see details in appendix  [ sec - refg1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is urgent for us to construct a unified rule to select the thermal flux for a system which is coupled with two heat baths and exchanges work with the outside .",
    "recent developments in finite - time thermodynamics are focused on the higher order universality  @xcite and the bounds  @xcite of efficiency at maximum power output for heat engines .",
    "it seems that these two issues can hardly be achieved within the conventional generic model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - engwh](a ) . instead of this generic model , esposito _ et al . _ considered a process of particle transport and verified that the efficiency at maximum power output up to the quadratic order , @xmath9 , can be achieved for tight coupling between the mass and energy flows and in the presence of a left - right symmetry in the whole system  @xcite .",
    "in addition , esposito _ et al .",
    "_ also found the efficiency at maximum power output of heat engines to be bounded between @xmath6 and @xmath10 under the low - dissipation condition  @xcite .",
    "the similar issues related to the cop at maximum @xmath2criterion were also addressed in ref .",
    "it is quite interesting if one can reproduce these results on the basis of the generic model or some revised version .",
    "the above researches raise the following questions : ( i ) is there a consistent way to express the generalized thermodynamic fluxes and forces for a heat engine or a refrigerator in contact with two heat baths and outputting or inputting mechanical work within the framework of irreversible thermodynamics ?",
    "( ii ) can the universal efficiency at maximum power output up to the quadratic order and the bounds of efficiency at maximum power output be achieved on the basis of the generic model of heat engine ? in their previous work  @xcite , the present authors try to solve these two problems by introducing the concept of weighted thermal flux for a system coupling with two heat baths and exchanging work with the outside under the assumption of local equilibrium .",
    "although this work guides a right direction , it still contains some shortcomings .",
    "first , we have not exactly expressed the entropy production rate in a canonical form that is the sum of products of generalized thermodynamic fluxes and forces .",
    "second , the physical meaning of the weighted thermal flux is still unclear .",
    "third , we have not explicitly constructed the mappings from two kinds of typical heat engines ( such as the low - dissipation heat engine  @xcite and the feynman ratchet  @xcite ) to the generic model .",
    "fourth , as it was commented by jarzynski  @xcite , the assumption of local equilibrium might be unnecessary because the effective temperature is just a parameter in our previous work  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will overcome the above four shortcomings by simultaneously introducing the concepts of weighted reciprocal of temperature and weighted thermal flux . in sec .",
    "[ sec - wtqunt ] , we discuss our logic for introducing the concepts of weighted reciprocal of temperature and weighted thermal flux . with the aid of these concepts , the generalized thermodynamic fluxes and forces can be defined in a consistent way without the assumption of local equilibrium for the heat engine .",
    "the entropy production rate can be expressed in a canonical form .",
    "the physical meanings of weighted reciprocal of temperature , weighted thermal flux and weighted numbers are clearly interpreted on the basis of a refined generic model . in sec .",
    "[ sec - empheateng ] , the universal efficiency at maximum power output up to the quadratic order and the bounds of efficiency at maximum power output are obtained for a tight - coupling engine abiding by a linear constitutive relation between the generalized thermodynamic fluxes and forces .",

    "[ sec - mapping ] , we explicitly construct the mappings from two kind of typical heat engines including the low - dissipation heat engine  @xcite ( as a representative of cyclic heat engines ) and the feynman ratchet  @xcite ( as a representative of autonomous heat engines ) into the refined generic model .",
    "in particular , using our refined generic model , we find that the low - dissipation heat engine is a kind of tight - coupling engine abiding by a linear constitutive relation . in sec .",
    "[ sec - refrig ] , we transplant the concepts of weighted reciprocal of temperature and weighted thermal flux to the optimization of refrigerators .",
    "section [ sec - summary ] contains a brief summary and discussions .",
    "in this section , we will introduce a generic model and the concepts of weighted reciprocal of temperature and weighted thermal flux for a heat engine .",

    "simultaneously , it releases heat @xmath7 per unit time into the cold bath at temperature @xmath13 . for an autonomous engine , we assume it operates in a steady state such that @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath12 are time - independent . for a cyclic engine ,",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath12 represent the average heat @xmath14 absorbed from the hot bath , the average heat @xmath15 released into the cold bath , and the average work output @xmath16 in each cycle , respectively , where @xmath17 is the period of the cycle .",

    "this property is similar to the minimally nonlinear model proposed by izumida and okuda  @xcite where the minimal nonlinear terms @xmath166 and @xmath167 are intuitively imposed .",
    "these minimal nonlinear terms are interpreted as the inevitable power dissipations accompanied by the finite - time motion of the heat engines  @xcite . however , the nonlinear terms in our model are mathematically strict , and they naturally enter into the expressions of @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
