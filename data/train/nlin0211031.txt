    "<S> the possible solitary wave solutions for a general boussinesq ( gbq ) type fluid model are studied analytically . after proving the non - painlev integrability of the model , the first type of exact explicit travelling solitary wave with a special velocity selection is found by the truncated painlev expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the general solitary waves with different travelling velocities can be studied by casting the problems to the newtonian quasi - particles moving in some proper one dimensional potential fields . for some special velocity selections , </S>",
    "<S> the solitary waves possess different shapes , say , the left moving solitary waves may possess different shapes and/or amplitudes with those of the right moving solitons . </S>",
    "<S> for some other velocities , the solitary waves are completely prohibited . </S>",
    "<S> there are three types of gbq systems ( gbqss ) according to the different selections of the model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> for the first type of gbqs , both the faster moving and lower moving solitary waves allowed but the solitary waves withmiddle \" velocities are prohibit . for the second type of gbqs </S>",
    "<S> all the slower moving solitary waves are completely prohibit while for the third type of gbqs only the slower moving solitary waves are allowed .    </S>",
