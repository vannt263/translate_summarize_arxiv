    "as crudely stated by jaffe @xcite , experimental confirmation of the casimir effect does not establish by itself the reality of zero point fluctuations .",
    "he explains this via the example of the electromagnetic field , where the energy of a smooth charge distribution , @xmath0 , can be precisely calculated from the energy stored in the electric field , a formula which arguably can not be taken as evidence for the electric field itself being real .",
    "fortunately , propagating electromagnetic waves are detected all the time .",
    "the moral : in the case of the casimir forces one should look for _ direct _ evidence of vacuum fluctuations .",
    "have they been found yet ? as of today , the answer is very controversial .",
    "since gr has much wider consensus , i here propose a search at the cosmological level .",
    "in fact , almost everybody admits that any sort of energy will always gravitate .",
    "thus , the energy density of the vacuum , more precisely , the vacuum expectation value of the stress - energy tensor , @xmath1 appears on the rhs of einstein s equations @xmath2 it therefore affects _ cosmology _ : there is a contribution @xmath3 of excitations above the vacuum , equivalent to a _ cosmological constant _ @xmath4 .",
    "recent data yield @xcite @xmath5 at issue is then the belief that zero point fluctuations will contribute in an essential way to the cosmological constant ( cc ) , e.g. , they will be of the same order of magnitude .",
    "different rigorous techniques have been used recently in order to perform this calculation , the result being that the absolute contributions of the known quantum fields ( all of which couple to gravity ) lead to a value which is off by roughly 120 orders of magnitude kind of a modern ( and indeed very thick ! ) ether .",
    "extremely severe cancelations should occur .",
    "observational tests , as advanced , see nothing ( or very little ) of it , what leads to the so - called cosmological constant problem @xcite .",
    "this problem is at present very difficult to solve and we will here _ not _ address such hard question directly .",
    "some _ almost _ successful attempts at solving the problem deserve to be mentioned , as the clever approaches by baum and hawking , and polchinski s phase ambiguity found in coleman s solution @xcite .",
    "what we do consider here with relative success in quite different approaches is the _ additional _ contribution to the cc coming from the _ non - trivial topology _ of space or from specific _ boundary conditions _ imposed on braneworld and other models .",
    "this can be viewed as kind of a casimir effect at cosmological scale : a _ cosmo - topological casimir effect_. assuming someone will be able to prove ( some day ) that the ground value of the cc is _ zero _ ( as many had suspected until very recently ) , we will be left with this incremental value coming from the topology or bcs .",
    "we show here that this value has the correct order of magnitude , e.g. , the one coming from the observed acceleration in the expansion of our universe , in three different types of models , involving : ( a ) small and large compactified scales , ( b ) ds and ads worldbranes , and ( c ) supergravitons .",
    "consider a universe with a space - time such as : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , which are very simple models for the space - time topology . a free scalar field pervading the universe will satisfy @xmath8 , restricted by the appropriate boundary conditions ( e.g. , periodic , in the first case ) . here",
    ", @xmath9 stands for a possible number of non - compactified dimensions .",
    "recall that the physical contribution to the vacuum or zero - point energy @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the hamiltonian and @xmath12 the vacuum state ) is obtained after subtracting @xmath13 ( @xmath14 being a compactification length ) , what gives rise to the finite value of the casimir energy @xmath15 , which will depend on @xmath14 , after a regularization / renormalization procedure is carried out .",
    "we discuss the casimir energy _ density _",
    "@xmath16 , for either a finite or an infinite volume of the spatial section of the universe . in terms of the spectrum : @xmath17 , the sum over @xmath18 involving , in general , several continuum and several discrete indices .",
    "the physical vacuum energy density corresponding to the contribution of a scalar field , @xmath19 in a ( partly ) compactified spatial section of the universe is coming from this field ; there might be other , in general . ]",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 is the usual mass - dimensional parameter to render the eigenvalues dimensionless ( we take @xmath22 but will insert the dimensionfull units at the end ) .",
    "the mass @xmath23 of the field will be kept different from zero ( a tiny mass can never be excluded ) and its allowed value will be constrained later . a lack of this simplified model : the coupling of the scalar field to gravity should be considered ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) . however , taking it into account does not change the order of magnitude of the results .",
    "the renormalization of the model is rendered much more involved , and one must enter a discussion on the orders of magnitude of the different contributions , which yields , in the end , an ordinary perturbative expansion , the coupling constant being finally re - absorbed into the mass of the scalar field .",
    "owing , essentially , to the smallness of the resulting mass for the scalar field , one can prove that , quantitatively , the difference in the final result is of some percent only .",
    "another consideration : our model is stationary , while the universe is expanding . again , this effect can be dismissed at the level of our order - of - magnitude calculation , since this contribution is clearly less than the one we will get taken the present value of the expansion rate @xmath24 per year , or from direct consideration of the hubble coefficient . in any case , these refinements are left for future work . here , to focus just on the essential issue , we perform a static calculation and the value of the casimir energy density and cc to be obtained will correspond to the present epoch . they are bound to change with time .      for a ( @xmath25)-toroidal universe , with @xmath26 the number of large and @xmath27 of small dimensions : @xmath28 which corresponds to all large ( resp .",
    "all small ) compactification scales being the same .",
    "the squared mass of the field should be divided by @xmath29 , but we have renamed it again @xmath30 to simplify .",
    "we also dismiss the mass - dim factor @xmath21 , easy to recover later .    for a ( @xmath26-toroidal , @xmath27-spherical)-universe , @xmath31 @xmath32 being a polynomial in @xmath33 of degree @xmath34 .",
    "we assume that @xmath35 is the number of non - compactified , large spatial dimensions , and @xmath36 needs to be regularized .",
    "we use the zeta function @xcite , taking advantage of our expressions in @xcite . no further subtraction or renormalization is needed ( the subtraction at infinity is zero , and not even a finite renormalization shows up ) . using the mentioned formulas , that generalize the chowla - selberg expression to encompass eqs .",
    "( [ t2 ] ) and ( [ ts2 ] ) , we can provide arbitrarily accurate results ( even for different values of the compactification radii @xcite ) .",

    "it is remarkable that we do get a well defined limit , independent of @xmath30 , provided @xmath30 is small enough .      for the most common cases , the constant @xmath46 in ( [ ff1 ] ) has been calculated to be of order @xmath48 , and the whole factor , in brackets , of order @xmath49 .",
    "this clearly shows the value of a precise calculation , as the one undertaken here , together with the fact that just a naive consideration of the dependencies of @xmath36 on the powers of the compactification radii , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , is actually _ not enough _ in order to get the correct result .",

    "the order of @xmath54 in the argument of @xmath55 is as big as : @xmath56 .",
    "the final expression for the vacuum energy density is independent of the mass @xmath23 of the field , provided this is small enough ( eventually zero ) .",
    "in fact , the last term in eq .",
    "( [ ff1 ] ) is exponentially vanishing ( zero , for _ app _ ) . in ordinary units",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     by replacing such values we obtain table 1 .",
    "the total number of large space dimensions is three ( our universe ) .",
    "good coincidence in absolute value with the observational value is obtained for @xmath26 large and @xmath59 small compactified dimensions , @xmath60 , and this for the small compactification length , @xmath51 , of the order of 10 to 1000 times the planck length @xmath61 ( a most reasonable range , according to string theory ) .",
    "the @xmath26 large and @xmath27 small dimensions are _ not _ all that are supposed to exist : @xmath26 and @xmath27 refer to the _ compactified _ ones only .",
    "there may be non - compactifed dimensions , what translates into a modification of the formulas above , but does not change the _ order of magnitude _ of the final numbers ( see e.g.  @xcite for an elaboration on this technical point ) .",
    "finally , simple power counting is _",
    "unable _ to provide the correct order of magnitude of the results here obtained .",
    "one should observe however that the sign of the cc is a problem with these oversimplified models ( generically they get it wrong ! ) .",
    "this is no longer so with the more elaborate theories involving bosons and fermions to be considered below where , using quite natural boundary conditions , an expanding universe can be obtained .",
    "braneworld theories may help to solve both the hierarchy problem and the cc problem .",
    "the bulk casimir effect can play an important role in the construction ( radion stabilization ) of braneworlds .",
    "we have calculated the bulk casimir effect ( effective potential ) for conformal and for massive scalar fields @xcite .",
    "the bulk is a 5-dim ads or ds space , with 2 ( or 1 ) 4-dim ds branes ( our universe ) .",
    "the results obtained are consistent with observational data .",

    "finally , we have also computed the effective potential for some multi - graviton models with supersymmetry @xcite . in one case ,",
    "the bulk is a flat manifold with the torus topology * r * @xmath84 * t*@xmath85 , and it can be shown that the induced cosmological constant can be rendered _ positive _ due to topological contributions @xcite . previously , the case of * r*@xmath86 had been considered . in the multi - graviton model",
    "the induced cosmological constant can indeed be positive , but only if the number of massive gravitons is sufficiently large , what is not easy to fit in a natural way . in the supersymmetric case , however , the cosmological constant turns out to be positive just by imposing anti - periodic bc in the fermionic sector .",
    "an essential issue in our model is to allow for non - nearest - neighbor couplings .",
    "the multi - graviton model is defined by taking @xmath87copies of the fields with graviton @xmath88 and stckelberg fields @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "our theory is defined by a lagrangian which is a generalization of the one in @xcite .",
    "it reads @xmath91\\ .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath92 and @xmath93 are difference operators , which operate on the indices @xmath18 as @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , where the @xmath97 are @xmath98 constants and the @xmath98 variables @xmath99 can be identified with periodic fields on a lattice with @xmath98 sites if the periodic boundary conditions , @xmath100 , are imposed .",
    "the latter condition assures that @xmath92 becomes the usual differentiation operator in a properly defined continuum limit .    in the case when anti - periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the fermionic sector ,",
    "the situation changes completely with respect to the bosonic one , since the fermionic mass spectrum becomes quite different .",
    "the one - loop effective potential in the anti - periodic case is calculated to be @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the sum of all the topological contributions .",
    "note that the first term on the rhs is always negative , but the whole effective potential can be positive , due to the presence of the topological term .",
    "thus , in the regime @xmath103 one has @xmath104 while in the opposite regime , @xmath105 , we can see that the topological contribution ( although still positive ) is negligible , and the effective potential remains negative . in fig .  1 , the corresponding plot of the full effective potential , eq . ( [ veff2 ] ) ,",
    "is depicted as a function of @xmath106 .",
    "the change of sign in the correct region is clearly observed .",
    "-8 mm    = 11.5 cm    -2 mm    to summarize , in the case of the torus topology we have obtained that the topological contributions to the effective potential have always a fixed sign , which depends on the bc one imposes .",
    "they are negative for periodic fields , and positive for anti - periodic fields .",
    "but topology provides then a mechanism which , in a most natural way , permits to have a positive cc in the multi - supergravity model with anti - periodic fermions . moreover , the value of the cc is regulated by the corresponding size of the torus .",
    "we can most naturally use the minimum number , @xmath107 , of copies of bosons and fermions , and show that as in the first , much more simple example , but now with the right sign! within our model the observational values for the cosmological constant , eq .",
    "( [ j1 ] ) , can be matched , by making very reasonable adjustments of the parameters involved .",
    "as a byproduct , the results that we have obtained @xcite may also be relevant in the study of electroweak symmetry breaking in models with similar type of couplings , for the deconstruction issue .",
