    "@xmath0-exponential distributions ( @xmath0-exponentials defined in the next section ) are used@xcite in modeling distributions of stocks . the @xmath0-exponentials possess two desirable features namely exhibit power law tails in the high end of the distribution and tend toward a gaussian when @xmath1 .",
    "these facts provide enough motivation to derive a variant of a wick theorem for linear combinations of independent identically distributed ( iid ) @xmath0-exponentials ( correlated @xmath0-exponentials ) .",
    "recent growth of interest in applications of physics to economics and to the theory of finance ( econophysics ) yields the wick theorem useful for the following purposes :    1 .   deriving exact relations between spectra of eigenvalues of financial covariance matrices related to @xmath0-exponentially distributed time series and of estimators of covariance matrices .",
    "this will be a generalization of existing exact relations @xcite for gaussian distributed time series .",
    "2 .   deriving algorithms @xcite for optimizing a portfolio ( minimizing the variance and/or the higher moments of a portfolio subject to a presumed return from a portfolio ) of stocks whose time series are @xmath0-exponentially distributed .",
