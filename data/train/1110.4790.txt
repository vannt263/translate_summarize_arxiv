    "the flow of granular materials through apertures is commonplace in a variety of industrial applications .",
    "studies in this respect can be separated into two major areas : ( 1 ) continuous flow , and ( 2 ) jamming .",
    "continuous granular flow is observed for dry non - cohesive materials if the size of the aperture is large ( typically above five grain diameters for spherical particles ) .",
    "jamming is observed whenever the opening is smaller , which requires the input of external perturbations in order to restart the flow .",
    "the cause of jamming is the formation of a blocking arch .",
    "we distinguish two type of arches : blocking arches ( or jamming arches ) and bulk arches . blocking arches form at the orifice during discharge and prevent the flow .",
    "bulk arches form at any place inside the packing during the dynamical process that leads the grains to reach mechanical equilibrium .",
    "arches are set of particles that are mutually stable .",
    "the removal of any particle in the arch leads to the destabilization of the others .",
    "a number of studies have considered the jamming of an aperture during the discharge of grains . these include experimental studies on two - dimensional ( 2d ) hoppers using circular grains @xcite and three - dimensional ( 3d ) silos using spherical and non - spherical particles @xcite , numerical simulations using discrete element methods in 2d @xcite , experiments with quasi-2d silos and spherical grains @xcite",
    ", 3d vibrated silos @xcite and experiments with tilted @xcite and wedge - shaped hoppers @xcite .",
    "also , the properties of blocking arches and bulk arches have been considered in the past @xcite . however",
    ", none of these studies have considered the effect of the preparation of the granular column prior to the discharge .",
    "it is known that the number and size of arches inside a granular assembly are dependent on the packing fraction .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the jamming of columns prepared at different packing fractions may occur with different probability .",
    "a related issue is the question of to what extent the arches formed in the bulk of the system are comparable with the arches that effectively block the aperture during drainage .",
    "in this paper we use a 2d pseudo - dynamic simulation scheme previously developed by manna and khakhar @xcite to study the effect of the initial packing fraction on the jamming probability and the correlation between bulk arches and blocking arches .",
    "the jamming probability is directly connected with the mean size of the avalanches @xcite .",
    "an avalanche is the flow of grains that occurs between the initiation of the discharge and the arrest of the flow due to the formation of a blocking arch @xcite .",
    "we will show that there is a strong dependence of the size of the avalanches with the packing fraction .",
    "however , there is not a monotonic relation between these two quantities .",
    "we also find that there is a poor correlation between the size of arches in the bulk and the size of the avalanches .",
    "a comparison between bulk arches and jamming arches reveals that the aperture not only imposes a cut - off on arches of horizontal span below the opening size , but also prevents the formation of some blocking arches that , in principle , are wide enough to induce jamming .",
    "our simulations are based on an algorithm for inelastic massless hard disks designed by manna and khakhar @xcite .",
    "this is a pseudo - dynamics that consists in small falls and rolls of the grains until they come to rest by contacting other particles or the system boundaries .",
    "we use a container formed by a flat base and two flat vertical walls .",
    "no periodic boundary conditions are applied .",
    "the deposition algorithm consists in choosing a disk in the system and allowing a free fall of length @xmath0 if the disk has no supporting contacts , or a roll of arc - length @xmath0 over its supporting disk if the disk has one single supporting contact @xcite .",
    "disks with two supporting contacts are considered stable and left in their positions .",
    "if in the course of a fall of length @xmath0 a disk collides with another disk ( or the base ) , the falling disk is put just in contact and this contact is defined as its _ first supporting contact_. analogously , if in the course of a roll of length @xmath0 a disk collides with another disk ( or a wall ) , the rolling disk is put just in contact . if the _ first supporting contact _ and the second contact are such that the disk is in a stable position , the second contact is defined as the _ second supporting contact _ ; otherwise , the lowest of the two contacting particle is taken as the _ first supporting contact _ of the rolling disk and the _ second supporting contact _ is left undefined . if , during a roll , a particle reaches a lower position than the supporting particle over which it is rolling , its _ first supporting contact _ is left undefined ( in this way the particle will fall vertically in the next step instead of rolling underneath the first contact ) .",
    "a moving disk can change the stability state of other disks supported by it , therefore , this information is updated after each move .",
    "the deposition is over once each particle in the system has both supporting contacts defined or is in contact with the base ( particles at the base are supported by a single contact ) .",
    "then , the coordinates of the centers of the disks and the corresponding labels of the two supporting particles , wall , or base , are saved for analysis .     before ( a ) and",
    "after ( b ) discharging through and opening of width @xmath1 .",
    "the red segments indicate the arches in the system . ]",
    "an important point in these simulations is the effect that the parameter @xmath0 has in the results since particles do not move simultaneously but one at a time .",
    "one might expect that in the limit @xmath2 we should recover a fairly `` realistic '' dynamics for fully inelastic non - slipping disk dragged downwards at constant velocity .",
    "this should represent particles deposited in a viscous medium or carried by a conveyor belt .",
    "although this dynamics contrasts with the dynamics of dry granulates , experiments on the jamming of fully submerged grains in gels @xcite have shown remarkable similarities with the more widely available data on dry systems .",
    "we chose @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 the particle diameter ) since we have observed that for smaller values of @xmath0 results are indistinguishable from those obtained here @xcite .",
    "the pseudo - dynamics approach has been chosen in view of the low cpu time demanded by this scheme . in this study",
    ", we need to prepare a large number of samples ( through tapping ) with a given packing fraction and then trigger discharges for different aperture sizes .",
    "more realistic simulations such as granular dynamics ( or discrete element method ) would require a much higher computational effort . in spite of the simplifications of the pseudo - dynamics",
    ", it has been shown that results on tapping agree qualitatively with granular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "in order to study the effect of packing fraction on the jamming of the flow through an aperture , we first need to prepare packings at reproducible packing fractions . to achieve this , several techniques can be applied .",
    "for example , the sequential deposition of grains submerged in a viscous liquid yield reproducible packing fractions that can be tuned by changing the friction coefficient of the particles or the density mismatch @xcite .",
    "we have chosen another well known technique to generate reproducible ensembles of packings : tapping .",
    "nowak et al . have shown that an appropriate tapping protocol can lead to reproducible states in the sense that an ensemble of configurations with well defined mean packing fraction is recovered if the same protocol is followed irrespective of the initial state @xcite .",
    "this has been more carefully discussed by ribire et al .",
    "dijksman et al .",
    "showed how different states can be obtained not only by changing the tap intensity but also by changing the tap duration @xcite .",
    "a similar effect was investigated by pica ciamarra et al . in submerged samples where",
    "a fluid pulse is used to excite the granular column @xcite .",
    "hence , we use a simulated tapping protocol ( see below ) to generate sets of initial configurations that have well defined mean packing fractions .     in the steady state of the tapping protocol as a function of the tap intensity @xmath5 . ]",
    "the simulations are carried out in a rectangular box of width @xmath6 containing @xmath7 equal - sized disks of diameter @xmath4 .",
    "initially , disks are placed at random in the simulation box ( with no overlaps ) and deposited using the pseudo - dynamic algorithm . once all the grains come to rest",
    ", the system is expanded in the vertical direction and randomly shaken to simulate a vertical tap .",
    "then , a new deposition cycle begins .",
    "after many taps of given amplitude , the system achieves a steady state where all characterizing parameters fluctuate around equilibrium values independently of the previous history of the granular bed .",
    "the existence of such `` equilibrium '' states has been previously reported in experiments @xcite .",
    "the tapping of the system is simulated by multiplying the vertical coordinate of each particle by a factor @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 ) .",
    "then , the particles are subjected to several ( about @xmath10 ) monte carlo loops where positions are changed by displacing particles a random length @xmath11 uniformly distributed in the range @xmath12 .",
    "new configurations that correspond to overlaps are rejected .",
    "this disordering phase is crucial to avoid particles falling back again into the same positions .",
    "moreover , the upper limit for @xmath11 ( i.e. @xmath13 ) is deliberately chosen so that a larger tap promotes larger random changes in the particle positions .",
    "the expansion amplitude @xmath8 ranges from @xmath14 up to @xmath15 .",
    "following refs .",
    "@xcite we quantify the tap intensity by the parameter @xmath16 . for each value of @xmath5",
    "studied , @xmath17 taps are carried out for equilibration followed by @xmath18 taps for production .",
    "@xmath19 deposited configurations are stored which are obtained by saving every @xmath20 taps during the production run after equilibration .",
    "these deposits will be used later as initial conditions for the discharge and flow through an opening .",
    "the deposited configurations are analyzed in search of bulk arches .",
    "we first identify all mutually stable particles which we define as directly connected and then we find the arches as chains of connected particles .",
    "two disks a and b are mutually stable if a is the left supporting particle of b and b is the right supporting particle of a , or viceversa .",
    "we measure the total number of arches , arch size distribution @xmath21 , and the horizontal span distribution of the arches @xmath22 .",
    "the latter is the probability density of finding an arch consisting of @xmath23 disks with horizontal span between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the horizontal span ( or lateral extension ) is defined as the projection onto the horizontal axis of the segment that joins the centers of the right - end disk and the left - end disk in the arch . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , we show an example of a deposited configuration with arches indicated by segments ( for a description of fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) see next section ) . notice that the pseudo - dynamics mimics the behavior of disks that roll without slipping .",
    "this corresponds to a system with infinite static friction which is expected to yield a large number and variety of arches .",
    "the arch structure of frictionless systems may differ significantly from the one seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "however , simulations with realistic discrete element methods with finite friction yield similar structures @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we present the steady state mean packing fraction , @xmath26 , of our granular deposits as a function of @xmath5",
    ". there exists a rather sharp decrease of @xmath26 as the tapping intensity is increased followed by a minimum and a very smooth increase .",
    "the sharp drop of @xmath26 is associated to a discontinuous order - disorder transition previously reported for this model @xcite and also observed in granular dynamics of polygonal grains @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the minimum packing fraction as a function of tap intensity has been reported for several models ( including a frustrated lattice gas model @xcite , a monte carlo type deposition @xcite and a realistic discrete element method simulation @xcite ) and in experiments of tapping with a quasi-2d system @xcite .",
    "for the model we use in this paper , the minimum @xmath26 has been shown to exist even if bidisperse systems are considered @xcite .    .",
    "]    the minimum in @xmath26 is caused to a large extent by the formation of arches @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the number and mean size of arches found in the system as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "when @xmath5 is increased considerably ( above @xmath27 ) , every tap expands the assembly in such a way that particles get well apart from each other . during deposition",
    ", particles will reach the free surface of the bed almost sequentially ( one at a time ) , reducing the chances of mutual stabilization .",
    "therefore , arches are less probable to form as @xmath5 increases and so @xmath26 must grow since fewer voids get trapped .",
    "indeed , we see in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that the number and size of arches decrease at large @xmath5 ( @xmath28 ) for increasing tap intensities .",
    "eventually , for very large @xmath5 , no arches are formed after each tap and @xmath26 will reach a limiting value . at lower @xmath5 ( @xmath29 )",
    ", the free volume injection due to a tap creates very narrow gaps between particles . for a given arch to grow by the insertion of a new particle , it is necessary to create a gap between two particles in the existing arch where the new particle can fit in",
    "this explains why increasing @xmath5 will promote the formation of larger arches and reduce @xmath26 in this regime .",
    "for very low tapping intensities ( @xmath30 ) , we find a rather constant @xmath26 .",
    "however , the number and size of the arches decrease with @xmath5 ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this would imply that a maximum in the packing fraction should be observed at such light tapping .",
    "this maximum has been recently reported in other models @xcite , but is not present in our pseudo - dynamics .",
    "notice that the number and size of the arches give only a rough indication for the free volume in the sample since the actual shape of the arches will also be important .",
    "for each deposit generated as described in the previous section , we trigger a discharge by opening an aperture of width @xmath31 relative to the diameter @xmath4 of the disk in the center of the base of the containing box .",
    "grains will flow out of the box following the pseudo - dynamics until a blocking arch forms or until the entire system is discharged ( with the exception of two piles resting on each side of the aperture ) . during the dynamics , disks that reach the bottom and",
    "whose centers lie on the interval that defines the opening will fall vertically ( even if the surface of the disk touches the edge of the aperture ) .",
    "this prevents the formation of arches with end disks sustained by the vertical edge of the orifice .",
    "although such arrangements happen in real experiments , they are uncommon @xcite . after each discharge , we record the size of the avalanche ( i.e. the number of grains flowed out ) and the final arrangement of the grains left in the box .",
    "averages are taken over 500 discharges for each value of @xmath5 used to prepare the initial packings .",
    "one single discharge attempt is carried out for each initial deposit .",
    "this allows us to assure that the initial preparation of the pack belongs to the ensemble of deposits corresponding to the steady state of the particular tap intensity chosen . in many experiments and most industrial applications ,",
    "discharges are triggered one after another from the same deposit without preparing the system in the initial condition again @xcite .",
    "however , some experiments do fill the container anew before each discharge @xcite .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) an image of the system after a discharge that resulted in a jam .",
    "it is clear that the structure of the packing is greatly affected by the partial discharge in our simulations .",
    "therefore , these final structures are not used for new discharges .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we plot the avalanche size distribution @xmath32 for a few values of @xmath5 and @xmath33 .",
    "we obtain this by counting the number of grains @xmath34 that flow in each of the @xmath19 discharges corresponding to each initial deposit generated for each @xmath5 .",
    "an exponential tail in @xmath32 has been observed in several previous studies , both two - dimensional @xcite and three - dimensional @xcite .",
    "manna and herrmann @xcite , using the same model , found avalanches with a power law distribution .",
    "notice however , that in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors trigger one avalanche after the other by simply removing a grain of the blocking arch .",
    "this minute perturbation to trigger avalanches may induce strong correlations between successive discharges in contrast with the strong rearrangements induced in most experiments . based in our limited number of discharges",
    ", we are unable to assert if an exponential or a power - law decay is at play in our simulations ( see log - lin and log - log plots in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "although we report @xmath32 up to @xmath35 , larger avalanches of up to @xmath36 disks are observed , whose statistics can be largely affected by the finite size of the system ( @xmath37 ) .     for several values of @xmath5 for @xmath33 .",
    "( a ) semilog plot , ( b ) log - log plot . ]    the mean avalanche size , @xmath38 , as a function of @xmath5 is shown in fig .  [ fig5 ] for various aperture sizes . as it can be expected , @xmath38 increases if @xmath31 increases .",
    "as we can see , for small apertures , @xmath38 grows monotonically as @xmath5 increases .",
    "however , for @xmath39 , the mean avalanche size presents a local maximum and a local minimum as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "it has been speculated @xcite that the size of the avalanches can be connected with the arches inside the granular deposit .",
    "although arches in the initial configuration are not dragged to the aperture during flow since arches actually break and form all the time in the process , it is believed that the ability of the system to form arches in the initial deposit is connected with the ability to form blocking arches during flow .",
    "indeed , the features observed in fig . [ fig5 ] are somewhat correlated with the number and size of the bulk arches .",
    "as @xmath5 is increased from the lower values , the size of the arches remains initially rather constant ( whereas the number of arches decreases , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this reduction in the number of arches leads to a smaller jamming probability and a rapid increase in the size of the avalanches ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "this regime ends when the sharp drop in @xmath26 ends ( @xmath40 ) . for larger @xmath5 and up to the packings with minimum packing fractions ( i.e. @xmath41 ) , the number and size of the arches increase . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath38 decreases due to the increased likelihood of jamming .",
    "finally , for @xmath42 , the number and size of the arches fall and a corresponding increase of the avalanche sizes is observed . from these observations",
    "we can assert that the number and size of arches in a given packing give an overall indication of the chances that the system will jam if it is left to flow through a small aperture .     as a function of @xmath5 for several sizes of the aperture @xmath31 .",
    "notice that @xmath38 is affected to a large extent by the rare large avalanches not reported in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . ]",
    "notwithstanding the previous analysis , the size of the avalanches is not only dependent on the preparation protocol defined in our case by @xmath5 but also on the actual size of the outlet imposed .",
    "for example , as we mentioned , for @xmath43 the mean avalanche size does not present the maximum and minimum suggested by the number and size of arches . in order to take into account the effect of the size of the aperture we measure the probability @xmath44 of finding an arch in the bulk of the deposits wide enough to block a given aperture @xmath31 .",
    "we measure the horizontal span of each arch as the projection on the horizontal axis of the segment that joins the centers of the end particles of the arch .",
    "an arch of span @xmath24 can jam an opening of width @xmath45 ( with @xmath4 the diameter of a grain ) . in this analysis",
    "we include the grains that do not form arches , which can jam any orifice with @xmath46 . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we plot @xmath44 as a function of @xmath5 and compare with the corresponding @xmath38 .",
    "overall , the probability of finding an arch wide enough to block an aperture of size @xmath31 decreases with @xmath31 in correspondence with the overall increase of @xmath38 .",
    "however , for a given @xmath31 , the dependence with @xmath5 does not show a clear anti - correlation between the probability and the mean avalanche size .",
    "this implies that the bulk arches can give only a rough indication of the eventual size of the avalanches that would discharge if an aperture is opened .     as a function of @xmath5 and probability @xmath44 of finding an arch of horizontal span @xmath47 for several apertures : ( a ) @xmath43 , ( b ) @xmath33 , ( c ) @xmath48 , ( d ) @xmath1 . ]",
    "it is important to mention that we have always opened the aperture at the center of the bottom of the container .",
    "the ordering observed for @xmath49 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) suggests that an effect related to the relative position of the aperture and the first layer of grains may be expected .",
    "the main effect would be related to the fact that particles just at the edges of the orifice do not flow in the pseudo - dynamics and these will produce a reduced effective aperture . if all discharges start from an initial packing so ordered that grains at the first layer always sit on the same horizontal positions , the mean avalanche size would depend on the horizontal position of the aperture .",
    "when this happens , one observes oscillations in the avalanche size as a function of the aperture size @xcite . however , this does not happen in our simulations as we can see in fig .",
    "this effect is observed only for highly ordered structures obtained with frictionless particles @xcite .",
    "our particles model non - slipping grains and the small deviations in position of the disks of the first layer with respect to a truly crystalline structure are sufficiently large to mask any systematic effect due to ordering that may require a detailed study on the position chosen for the aperture .",
    "it is generally believed that packing fraction is a good parameter to characterize many properties of a granular bed @xcite .",
    "results obtained for deposits prepared at a given @xmath26 are not necessarily general and must be repeated for different packing fractions . however",
    ", this does not mean that packing fraction is the only or the main factor that can affect the results . in table",
    "[ table1 ] we present part of the data of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] but ordered by mean packing fractions @xmath26 corresponding to the steady state obtained for each given @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "as we can see , the mean avalanche size depends on @xmath26 in a non trivial way . at the highest @xmath26 , obtained by light tapping",
    ", the mean avalanche size can range from a few grains to a hundred grains depending on the value of @xmath5 used to create the packings .",
    "the larger the aperture @xmath31 , the wider the range in @xmath38 within this regime where the system is rather ordered but the number and size of the arches fall with increasing @xmath5 ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) . for low @xmath26 , deposits with similar packing fractions but created with low and high tap intensities display different values of @xmath38 for any given @xmath31 .",
    "as we can see , deposits with the same @xmath26 can present different values of @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , the steady state ensembles of packings with equal @xmath26 obtained by tapping may behave differently .",
    "this has been pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite where steady states with the same @xmath26 but bearing different stresses were obtained through tapping . in our simulations ,",

    "since we have access to both bulk and blocking arches in our simulations , we compare a few properties and discuss on the implications for the jamming probability .    in fig .",

    "the large arches generally form upstream supported by two stationary piles resting on both sides of the opening .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] that blocking arches tend to be larger than bulk arches ( even after the correction due to the cut - off imposed by @xmath31 ) .",

    "this is to be expected for small @xmath23 since small arches with small span might not be able to jam the aperture .",

    "the inset of panel ( c ) shows two schematic arches of @xmath57 which are wide enough to jam the orifice but only one of them fits in the gap left by the two piles at rest on each side of the aperture . ]",
    "we have considered granular avalanches discharged though small apertures at the bottom of a container by using a 2d pseudo - dynamic model .",
    "we have focused on the effect of the packing fraction of the granular deposit prior to the avalanche discharge .",
    "the results indicate that the initial packing fraction has an important effect on the mean avalanche size for a given opening size .",

    "most importantly , very different values of @xmath38 can correspond to initial packings with the same packing fractions that were prepared by using different tap intensities .",
    "it is important to note that these results are obtained not for single packings but for ensembles of deposits representative of steady states corresponding to a particular tap intensity .",
    "our main conclusion is that packing fraction is not a good macroscopic parameter to predict the size of the avalanches that would flow through a given aperture .",
    "it seems that further information is necessary .",
    "although this information is expected to reside in the size and number of arches , we have seen that the correlation of these with @xmath38 is not consistent for all openings @xmath31 .",
    "it seems that is not possible to predict the jamming probability of a granular column as it flows through a small aperture based on a few global properties of the initial deposits .",
    "a side result from our study is that blocking arches are generally wider than the arches found in bulk .",
    "this is not only due to the fact that the aperture imposes a lower cut - off for the possible jamming arches , but also to the fact that even arches formed in the bulk which are wide enough to block the outlet have shapes not compatible with the conical boundary effectively created by the two piles of stationary grains at the sides of the aperture .",

    "<S> ensembles of packings with different mean packing fractions are created by tapping the system at different intensities . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , packing fraction is not a good indicator of the ability of the deposit to jam a given orifice . </S>",
    "<S> different mean avalanche sizes are obtained for deposits with the same mean packing fraction that were prepared with very different tap intensities . </S>",
    "<S> it has been speculated that the number and size of arches in the bulk of the granular column should be correlated with the ability of the system to jam a small opening . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this correlation , if exists , is rather poor . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison between bulk arches and jamming arches ( i.e. , arches that block the opening ) reveals that the aperture imposes a lower cut - off on the horizontal span of the arches which is greater than the actual size of the opening . </S>",
    "<S> this is related to the fact that blocking arches have to have the appropriate orientation to fit the gap between two piles of grains resting at each side of the aperture . </S>"
