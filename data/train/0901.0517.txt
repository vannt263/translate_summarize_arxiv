    "distance estimates to celestial objects are one of the most fundamental measurements in astronomy and astrophysics .",
    "knowledge of the distance to astronomical sources in the sky are needed in order to estimate their physical properties , such as luminosities , masses , kinematics , and dynamics . in recent years",
    ", the technique of very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) has been used to make precise astrometric measurements ( to a precision of of a few tens of microarcseconds for a single observation ) and thus holds the promise to extend the range of the direct distance measurements of annual parallax up to at least 10 kpc with 10% accuracy using radio telescopes such as the very long baseline array ( vlba ) of the national radio astronomy obsevatory ( nrao ) .",
    "compact , bright radio - emitting objects such as pulsars and masers are choice beacons for vlbi distance measurements across the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such distance measurements enable enormous improvements in our understanding of galactic structure and also the physics of individual objects .",
    "@xcite reviewed the importance of measuring parallaxes and proper motions to help delineate galactic structure and showed , in a survey for parallaxes and proper motions of young , high - mass stars , that kinematic distances are systematically too large .    in this paper",
    ", we report on using the vlba to measure the annual parallax of the star - forming region iras  00420@xmath15530 , using the bright water masers associated with the iras source .",
    "iras  00420@xmath15530  @xmath6 , @xmath7 is a star formation region exhibiting a molecular outflow @xcite , 3.6 cm and 3 mm continuum emission @xcite , and h@xmath0o  masers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is also coincident with dense gas traced by hco@xmath8(1 - 0 ) , indicating that the cluster of young stars remains deeply embedded in its natal cloud of molecular gas @xcite .",
    "the systemic velocity of the gas around iras  00420@xmath15530  is @xmath951 km s@xmath10  with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) based on the measurements of ammonia radial velocities @xcite and the hco@xmath8(1 - 0 ) @xcite .",
    "the water masers occur at similar line - of - sight velocities as the surrounding gas , but with a somewhat broader range ( lsr velocities @xmath552 to @xmath540 km s@xmath10 ) .    distances to iras  00420@xmath15530  of 4.3 to 7.7 kpc ( presumably kinematic , in most cases ) have been used in recent papers , despite a much closer photometric distance of 1.7 kpc @xcite . reflecting this broad range of distance estimates , luminosities of the iras source ( presumably the exciting star ) between @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "have been reported ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . clearly , a better distance estimate is desirable for this object .",
    "in addition , iras  00420@xmath15530  lies in the direction of the perseus arm , which has been the topic of a recent distance study by @xcite .",
    "@xcite addressed the large discrepancy between the luminosity and kinematic distance estimates in the perseus arm by accurately measuring the distance ( using vlbi techniques ) of the methanol masers in the compact hii region w3(oh ) .",
    "it is important that distances to other objects in the direction of the perseus arm be precisely measured to compare to the work presented by @xcite , and to determine small - scale deviations from the distances and kinematics in this region which could be due to peculiar motions of the studied objects .",
    "we present here a careful analysis of the observing style , calibration techniques , data reduction and parallax / proper motion fitting in order to provide the error analysis required to derive the most precise measurements of the distance to iras  00420@xmath15530 .",
    "between 2005 november and 2006 september , we made twelve 4-hour vlba observations ( approximately monthly ) of the h@xmath0o  masers in iras  00420@xmath15530  to measure their annual parallax and proper motion .",
    "the large number of monthly epochs were chosen to ensure that the parallax and proper motion fits would not be confused by maser spots fading and disappearing between epochs . in the end",
    ", most of the spots persisted through most epochs , and this was not a problem .",
    "the observations were made from the vlba s dynamic observing queue , wherein our standardized observing script was initiated opportunistically and periodically in real - time according to availability of the array , scientific ranking ( relative to fixed - schedule programs and other dynamically scheduled observations ) and other operational constraints , such as observing direction and weather . since iras",
    "00420@xmath15530  is at relatively high declination ( and thus circumpolar at most vlba sites ) , our four - hour observation tended to rise to the top of the dynamic queue quite easily and often as a convenient schedule - filler , and so the interval between epochs was often shorter than one month .",
    "the properties of the observations are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",

    "the accuracy of phase - referencing calibration at the vlba is limited by an zenith angle - dependent delay error arising from inaccuracies in the macroscopic troposphere model used at the vlba correlator @xcite .",
    "the seasonal zenith troposphere delay model is typically in error by many centimeters , and this leads to a significant time - dependent delay error between the science target and phase - reference calibrator since they are observed at slightly different zenith angles . as a result , the phase - referencing determined for the calibrator does not fully calibrate the target unless this macroscopic component is compensated .",
    "this effect is calibrated by observing a set of bright ( @xmath29 jy ) calibrators at a wide range of zenith angles and fitting the observed residual delays for the zenith troposphere error , assuming the delay increases away from the zenith as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the zenith angle . the standard approach ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is to select approximately one dozen such calibrators distributed over the entire sky and observe them 1@xmath53 times over the course of the observation to get a few instantaneous measurements of the zenith delay .",
    "such an approach does not permit tracking the delay error in time very accurately and makes no allowance for any azimuth dependence of the delay error , such as might be expected as weather changes over an antenna .",
    "our approach was to select a smaller set of calibrators distributed sufficiently in zenith angle ( @xmath32 ) at the approximate azimuth of our target , and observe them more continuously during the observation .",
    "after each observation , the data were correlated in two passes .",
    "the first pass correlated all four spectral windows at low spectral resolution ( 32 channels ) .",
    "the second pass correlated only the spectral window containing the h@xmath0o  maser lines with 1024 channels , yielding a channel spacing of 15.625 khz , and thus a spectral resolution in the lsr of 18.75 khz , or 0.253 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the visibility calibration was performed in nrao aips @xcite , following the exact same procedure for each epoch .",
    "the low - spectral - resolution data were processed first , as follows .",
    "first , several standard a priori calibrations were applied , including revised earth orientation parameter corrections ( eop , important for good astrometry ) , parallactic angle phase , quantized sampling bias amplitude corrections , and system temperature / gain amplitude calibration .",
    "second , a scan on one of the bright macroscopic troposphere calibrators ( j2202@xmath14216@xmath33bl  lac , @xmath43.0 jy ) was selected to serve as a reference for all subsequent phase and delay calibration solutions . for this scan , the net residual delay and",
    "non - linear bandpass was determined in each spectral window .",
    "this solution , applied to the rest of the data , removes constant instrumental phase and delay errors , introduces a tropospheric delay residual offset ( whatever the troposphere delay was toward j2202@xmath14216 in this scan ) , and leaves behind only relative ( and relatively small ) delay residuals that are time- and direction - dependent .",
    "these errors include any residual instrumental clock drift , zenith - angle - dependent relative macroscopic troposphere delay errors ( to be solved using the seven bright calibrators ) , and time - dependent ( phase- ) delay errors ( to be phase - referenced ) .",
    "the macroscopic troposphere delay residual calibration is obtained by applying the calibrations described above and solving for the phase in each of the four spectral windows and in each of the scans on the seven bright calibrators .",
    "these phases are then fit for multi - band delays . in general , the likelihood of ambiguity resolution problems in the multi - band delay determination are small , since these delays are residuals , and the expected zenith delay errors are expected to be only a fraction of a nanosecond .",
    "the multi - band delays are then used to jointly solve for the residual instrumental clock drift and time - dependent zenith troposphere delay error , assuming the @xmath30 model .",
    "the separation of these two effects depends upon observing the calibrators out of zenith angle order , else a monotonic clock drift would be difficult to distinguish from a component of the elevation - dependent troposphere delay residual .",
    "solutions with constant , linear , quadratic , and cubic time - dependence ( and all combinations ) in both clock and troposphere delay terms were attempted .",
    "the higher - order fits tended to diverge .",
    "optimal fits were obtained for quadratic troposphere and linear clock .",
    "typical zenith delay residuals were found to be a few to 15 cm , with variations over four hours at the 1@xmath52 cm level .",
    "the overall accuracy of this delay calibration is approximately 0.5@xmath51.0 cm , and is limited by the simplicity of the zenith angle dependence and unmodeled local time - variation of the troposphere delay ( of the sort we would otherwise phase - reference ) . since this is a residual effect , negative troposphere delay solutions are possible .",
    "also , the troposphere delay solution is not referenced to any specific antenna since the zenith angle dependence and differential zenith angle sampling at each antenna breaks the usual degeneracy .",
    "figure [ mtpherr ] shows , for epoch a , the systematic phase - referencing errors for iras  00420@xmath15530  and j0047@xmath15657  due to their time - dependent zenith angle difference relative to j0042@xmath15708  and the ( mean ) zenith delay model calibration determined as described above .",
    "the zenith delay errors range in magnitude from 0.6 cm for kp to 13.5 cm for hn ( br did not participate , and sc was excluded ) .",
    "the errors are generally larger for iras  00420@xmath15530  since it has a larger separation from j0042@xmath15708 , and at a relatively unfavorable position angle ( near transit ) that maximizes the zenith angle difference . only for the easternmost antennas in the array ( hn , nl ) , which are observing farthest from transit ,",
    "is the position angle of j0047@xmath15657  relative to j0042@xmath15708sufficient to excessively amplify this systematic phase error .    the vlba station at st .",
    "croix ( sc ) was generally the worst performing station in the delay calibration , yielding poor multi - band delay fits and/or poor zenith delay solutions .",
    "this is caused by excessive and highly variable tropospheric water vapor at sc s sea - level location and humid climate .",
    "since this station also yields the least accurate phase referencing solutions for the same reasons , it was excised from all epochs .",
    "this results in the loss of many relatively long baselines , but the poor calibration of these baselines would be of questionable value .    at this point , the high - spectral - resolution data were processed , first with all of the same _ a priori _ calibrations as the low - resolution data .",
    "the tropospheric delay calibration solution ( including the clock drift ) was then transferred from the low - resolution dataset , to be used as an additional a priori calibration for the high - resolution data .",
    "the same strong calibrator scan was selected to obtain the global instrumental reference calibration , except a polynomial bandpass was used since the per - channel snr was insufficient for a sampled bandpass at the high spectral resolution .",
    "finally , the phase - reference calibration was determined on j0042@xmath15708 .",
    "the full calibration was then applied to iras  00420@xmath15530 , j0042@xmath15708 , and the secondary phase - reference calibrator , j0047@xmath15657 . after re - sampling the velocity axis for each epoch to the lsr",
    ", the data were exported in uvfits format .",
    "the data for each epoch were then imaged in difmap @xcite , selecting the channels with maser emission .",
    "first , a relatively low spatial resolution image of a wide field - of - view was generated to spatially locate significant maser regions , then each of these regions were imaged at full resolution .",
    "a simple multi - field clean deconvolution script was developed in difmap to optimize the imaging of channels with signal in more than one region .",
    "figure [ skyfig ] shows the spatial distribution of the maser regions ( integrated clean components from epoch a ) , integrated in velocity .",
    "there are nine major maser spot regions , two of which ( 4 and 7 ) contain two distinct maser spots , with significant emission in a total of 44 channels .",
    "the typical imaging sensitivity achieved per channel was 100@xmath5200 mjy / beam , with maser peaks ranging up to @xmath475 jy beam@xmath10 .",
    "figure [ integspecfig ] shows the spectrum of iras  00420@xmath15530 integrated over all maser spot regions , for a representative set of epochs ( a , d , g , and j ) , indicating the overall variability of the source .",
    "figure [ dynspecfig ] shows separately the time - dependent spectra for maser regions 14 . a variety of spectral structure and behavior is observed .",
    "regions 1 and 3 show strong , stable , and simple spectral structure .",
    "region 2 shows a monotonic drift of five channels in the peak of emission .",
    "region 4 shows two distinct spectral components : the feature at @xmath34 km s@xmath10  drifts by about one channel and fades , while the feature at @xmath35 km s@xmath10 , indistinct at epoch a , grows in strength with epoch and is stationary in velocity .",
    "the remaining regions ( not shown ) are generally weaker , and show a similar range of structure and variability . of these",

[ integspecfig ] ]    ]    to obtain an estimate of the fundamental phase - referencing accuracy of these observations , continuum images ( bandwidth : 14 mhz ) of the secondary phase - reference calibrator , j0047@xmath15657(snr@xmath420 ) , were generated .",
    "for the ensemble of epochs ( excluding epoch k ) , the rms peak position of j0047@xmath15657  is @xmath3630 @xmath37as in both right ascension and declination , with no evidence of any significant systematic motion .",
    "( without the macroscopic troposphere solution applied , the declination rms increases by a factor of 2 , indicating the importance of this calibration . )",
    "this estimate establishes a basis for estimating the astrometric precision ( per snr ) of the maser observations .",
    "specifically , a snr of @xmath420 nominally corresponds to an astrometric precision of @xmath430 @xmath37as .    this error estimate can not be transferred and scaled directly to the observations of iras  00420@xmath15530 .",
    "a variety of systematic errors render themselves differently for iras  00420@xmath15530  and j0047@xmath15657 .",
    "j0047@xmath15657  is only 0.66@xmath14 from j0042@xmath15708 , the primary calibrator , less than half the 1.41@xmath14 j0042@xmath15708iras  00420@xmath15530  separation , and so the phase - referencing calibration is nominally more accurate for j0047@xmath15657 .",
    "furthermore , near transit at the center of the vlba , the position angle of the j0042@xmath15708j0047@xmath15657  separation is mostly in azimuth while that of j0047@xmath15657iras  00420@xmath15530  is mostly in zenith angle ( see figure [ calgeo ] ) , making any residuals in the zenith angle - dependent macroscopic troposphere calibration more important for iras  00420@xmath15530 . as described below , these and other systematic errors place more stringent limits on the astrometric precision of iras  00420@xmath15530 , despite the fact that most of the maser spots used in the parallax fitting have higher snr than j0047@xmath15657 .",
    "parallax and proper motion calculations rely on measurements of the time - dependent direction of consistently identified , small , physically coherent objects relative to a distant , presumed stationary , background reference , in this case , the phase reference calibrator .",
    "masers are among the most compact observable objects available , but at the resolution of the vlba , they are generally not strictly point - like .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear to what degree masers can be characterized as distinct physical objects since they likely arise not from fixed discrete objects , but rather from coherent velocity structures within a presumably larger physical structure ( e.g. , gas cloud ) .    indeed ,",
    "most of the maser spots in iras  00420@xmath15530  are clearly not strictly point - like and are variable in their marginally resolved structure and flux density from epoch to epoch .",
    "furthermore , the spectral structure of each maser spot is generally non - trivial , with the peak for some spots clearly drifting substantially in velocity from epoch - to - epoch .",
    "these factors make reliable epoch - to - epoch identification of distinct physical features difficult .",
    "therefore , rather than fitting complicated multiple point and resolved gaussian model components to the images or visibilities , and thereby introducing an additional unphysical component in the analysis , we have adopted the simple peak position ( fitted from image pixels ) as the best estimate of the maser position , and have accepted the inevitable intrinsic variation of this estimate ( a form of traditional confusion within the synthesized beam ) as an additional source of error in our analysis .    for each of eleven distinct spots in 9 spot regions , and in each channel with significant power ( see below ) ,",

    "additionally , after a trial fit , partial epoch ranges for some spots were discarded where it was evident that the assumption of a consistent discrete physical component following the relatively simple parallax and proper motion trajectory was violated .",
    "presumably , the peak derived from our finite - resolution observations shifted abruptly as a result of intrinsic structural changes .",
    "epoch k was excluded entirely since the mauna kea station , which provides the longest baselines , did not participate .",
    "the fits for three maser regions ( 2 , 6 , & 7a ) were rejected outright from further analysis on the basis of poor consistency among channels or unphysical ( negative ) parallax estimates .",
    "each of these regions show substantial spectral complexity , including variation in the velocity of peak emission , indicating that they are non - ideal test - particles for parallax measurements .",
    "no degree of judicious epoch selection makes these maser regions recoverable for parallax estimation purposes .",
    "determining proper epoch- and maser - dependent weights for the fitting process is non - trivial , since accurate _",
    "total _ errors , including systematics , for the peak position estimates are not readily available _ a priori_. formally , for a well - isolated point source with no systematic errors , the precision of the peak position estimates would be inversely proportional to the snr of the peak emission , and the resulting formal weights would be proportional to the _ square _ of the snr . in practice , such an estimate of astrometric precision must be a lower limit due to systematic errors arising from the complicating maser structure considerations noted above , as well as to per - epoch residuals in the macroscopic troposphere and phase - referencing calibration .",
    "additionally , the wide range of flux densities among maser regions and epochs ( @xmath4260 jy ) result in a range of weights of 2 orders of magnitude or more for some maser spots .",
    "such weights could have a deleterious effect on the effective sampling of the parallax ellipse during the year , and lead to complicated biases in the parallax estimates .",
    "therefore , we adopted weights proportional to snr ( i.e. , the square root of the formal weights ) for the final fits .",
    "for most of the fits , this choice was not consequential ; use of the formal weights yields parameter estimates not significantly different from that obtained with snr weights .",
    "our parallax measurement is not limited by per - epoch snr , but rather by _ per - epoch _ systematic errors in the astrometry .",
    "while the proper motions may be expected to vary among the spot regions ( and even among channels in a single region ) due to intrinsic internal motions , the parallax estimates should be consistent for all of them since the range of maser emission is very small ( @xmath46 mas ) relative to its distance ( kiloparsecs ) , and is unlikely to be significantly deeper than it is wide . in practice ,",
    "the variation of the parallax estimates among maser spot regions and channels is more complicated .",
    "while several ( but not all ) maser regions show impressive internal consistency , the dispersion of parallax estimates over the entire ensemble is considerably larger than the formal errors would imply .",
    "this fact is related to residual systematic errors affecting the fits which originate in the complexity and evolution of the spectral and spatial structure of the maser regions , residual calibration errors , and the details of the time - dependent sampling of the parallax ellipse .    at any single epoch",
    ", calibration errors will affect different maser spot regions uniformly , and so are systematic , i.e. , relative position measurements among masers at one epoch have no information about the magnitude of such errors .",
    "over many epochs ( up to eleven , in this case ) , however , we assume such errors can be treated as approximately stochastic . similarly , after excising obviously discrepant epochs as described above , we treat any _ non - linear _ intrinsic variations in the peak position due to internal structural and flux density evolution as approximately stochastic over many epochs .",
    "these errors limit the precision of the parallax estimate , but are unlikely to bias it substantially . with up to eleven epochs per fit , we assert that the rms residuals determined in the fits are a reasonable estimate of the mean per - epoch astrometric precision achieved in our observations , typically @xmath47as in both dimensions .",
    "the error bars in figure [ parallaxtimefig ] reflect the relative weights used in the fit , and are conservatively scaled so that their minimum is 30 @xmath37as .    of the remaining 27 fits in 8 maser regions ,",
    "most yield internally consistent parallax and proper motions ( with channel ) , but the overall range of parallax results remains relatively large : 0.41 - 0.62 mas , with formal errors in the range 0.01 - 0.1 mas ( see figure [ parallaxhist ] which shows the distribution in the range 0.40 - 0.52 mas ) .",
    "in addition to several obvious outliers ( there are three such outliers greater than 0.55 mas and not shown in figure [ parallaxhist ] ) , there is some evidence of maser region - dependent systematic errors .",
    "a careful analysis of the time - dependent weighted sampling shows that those maser regions for which the later epochs were undetected or discarded tend to yield systematically higher parallax estimates ( near or in excess of 0.50 mas ) compared to those with more complete sampling .",
    "fitting trials on the completely sampled maser regions ( e.g. , region 3 ) using _ only _ the early epochs confirm this effect .",
    "we therefore have discarded maser regions 4a , 7b , and 8 as insufficiently sampled and inadequate for further consideration .",
    "the remaining 16 maser region channels are shown in the filled histogram of figure [ parallaxhist ] .",
    "the distribution still appears bimodal , but the two states can not be segregated according to maser region .",
    "the unweighted dispersion of the remaining measurements is 0.02 mas , broadly consistent with the typical formal errors in the individual fits , which arise from a combination of pure statistics and per - epoch systematics that are stochastic over many epochs .",
    "the individual parallax solutions for the remaining 16 maser region channels have been averaged with weights derived from their formal errors to yield a net parallax estimate of 0.458@xmath360.005 mas .",
    "figure [ finalest ] shows the final parallax signature in right ascension and declination as a function of time ( bold curve ) also plotted are the per - channel data ( filled and open dots , with error bars as in figure [ parallaxtimefig ] ) and the range of individual channel fits ( hashed region ) ; the fitted proper motions and relative position offsets from the individual solutions have been removed .",
    "it is clear that several epochs ( e.g. , epoch c in right ascension , epochs i and l in declination ) are affected by a substantial residual systematic offset in one dimension or the other , but that for most epochs , the magnitude of these systematics is similar or smaller than the statistical distribution of measurements .",
    "since the parallax solution has been derived directly from the data , it is difficult to accurately ascertain the true balance between the per - epoch systematic and statistical contributions .",
    "although the formal errors in each individual maser channel solution nominally account for both sources of error ( assuming the per - epoch systematics are approximately stochastic over many epochs ) , we nonetheless conservatively double the formal error estimate and adopt a final parallax estimate of 0.46@xmath360.01 mas .",
    "the distance to iras  00420@xmath15530  is therefore 2.17@xmath360.05 kpc , a measurement with a precision of @xmath33% .",
    "with direct measurements of the distance and three - dimensional space velocity of objects such as iras  00420@xmath15530  using the vlba , it becomes possible to more accurately evaluate the veracity of the kinematic distances derived from galactic rotation curves , and to do so over a larger portion of the galaxy than with any other available means .",
    "this is especially important outside the solar circle where rotation curve analyses have had to rely principally on photometric and other indirect distance estimates .",
    "a large range of distance estimates for iras  00420@xmath15530  have been used in the literature for various astrophysical analyses .",
    "most tabulated distances have been in the range @xmath48@xmath49 kpc , and are presumably kinematic in origin .",
    "our h@xmath0o  maser parallax distance of 2.17 kpc is , in fact , most consistent with the oldest published distance estimate , a photometric distance of 1.7 kpc @xcite .    the direct geometric distance estimate reported here is more than a factor of two closer than the kinematic distance of @xmath44.7 kpc implied by a radial velocity of @xmath50 km s@xmath10  using the rotation curve of @xcite (",
    "henceforth , bb93 ) .",
    "however , those authors acknowledge systematic offsets from their rotation curve in the sample they use to derive it ( hii regions and reflection nebulae ) , including the fact that it overestimates the ( galactocentric ) orbital velocities of most objects within @xmath43 kpc outside the solar circle .",
    "furthermore , at the galactic longitude and distance of iras  00420@xmath15530 , in particular , their line - of - sight velocity residuals show a systematic deficit of @xmath425 km s@xmath10 ; their rotation curve nominally predicts a radial velocity of @xmath525 km s@xmath10  for iras  00420@xmath15530 , @xmath421 km s@xmath10  slower than observed .",
    "similar large - scale systematic residuals occur at many outer galaxy longitudes , and they attribute this to non - circular galactic orbits , or more generally , the inadequacy of an axisymmetric model for the velocity field of the outer galaxy . in short , although the rotation curve predicts galactic orbital velocities with errors of only 10@xmath515% ( out of 200@xmath5250 km s@xmath10 ) , it is a much poorer predictor of _ line - of - sight _ velocities measured at the sun , and so kinematic distance estimates for the outer galaxy will be generally unreliable .    since our vlba measurements provide the three - dimensional space velocity ( relative to the sun ) of iras",
    "00420@xmath15530 , it is possible to explore the nature of its galactic orbit in detail . adopting the maser component in region 3 , @xmath51 km s@xmath10  as representative for iras  00420@xmath15530 we find a _",

    "we assume tentatively that the internal motion of this component is not large enough to excessively bias our analysis ( this point will be addressed in greater detail below ) .",
    "the following analysis is limited by the accuracy of knowledge of the absolute orbital speed of the galaxy and the sun s peculiar motion relative to the lsr .",
    "we have provisionally assumed standard iau values for the lsr parameters , namely that it is @xmath55 kpc from the galactic center and moving at @xmath56 km s@xmath10  on a circular orbit @xcite .",
    "the sun s peculiar motion relative to the lsr has been assumed to be @xmath57 km s@xmath10  ( toward the galactic center ) , @xmath58 km s@xmath10  ( along the orbit ) , and @xmath59 km s@xmath10  ( out of the plane ) as measured by @xcite using hipparcos data .",
    "the calculations have be done in three dimensions , but with no correction for the sun s unknown distance from the galactic plane .    converting to the galactocentric frame by correcting for @xmath60 and solar peculiar motions",
    ", we find that iras  00420@xmath15530  is moving toward the galactic center at 23.0 km s@xmath10 , around the galaxy ( circular component ) at 202.0 km s@xmath10 , and toward the plane ( from below ) at 5.8 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the in - plane components of iras  00420@xmath15530 s velocity vector are shown in figure [ irasgal ] .",
    "thus , iras  00420@xmath15530  is moving significantly slower than the circular speed of @xmath4224 km s@xmath10  predicted by the bb93 rotation curve , and has a substantial non - circular component toward the galactic center .    by assuming a nominal orbital speed for iras  00420@xmath15530",
    ", we can shift our velocity measurements to a local standard of rest orbiting the galaxy at the position of iras  00420@xmath15530 .",
    "figure [ irascorot220 ] shows the resulting in - plane peculiar motion of iras  00420@xmath15530 , assuming its orbital speed is 220 km s@xmath10 .",
    "( the bb93 rotation curve prediction is insignificantly larger ; essentially we nominally assume the rotation curve is flat in this region of the galaxy . ) also shown is the peculiar motion of w3(oh ) ( also in its _ own _ standard of rest ) as reported by @xcite , also assuming an orbital speed of 220 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the peculiar motions of iras  00420@xmath15530  and w3(oh ) are in almost exactly the same direction , and very nearly in the direction of the sun . combined with the large - scale systematic line - of - sight velocity deficit observed in the bb93 rotation curve residuals ,",
    "this is highly suggestive of a large - scale anomalous motion of the material in this region of the galaxy , i.e. , the perseus spiral arm , in a direction toward the sun .",
    "such anomalous motion could be related to the formation and propagation of the perseus spiral arm , and is evidence of the inadequacy of axisymmetric models of galactic rotation .",
    "an obvious alternative to this conclusion is that the sun has a large velocity component in the direction of these objects , either in terms of the lsr orbital speed , the solar peculiar motion , or both .",
    "indeed , the orbital speed component of the sun s velocity is the least well - understood component of its motion due to uncertainties in the overall scale of the galaxy ( @xmath61 and @xmath60 ) , and the component of solar peculiar motion in the direction of galactic rotation .",
    "however , the velocity adjustments required of the alternative scenarios are generally implausible . increasing the galactic orbital speed for the solar lsr to 250 km s@xmath10  ( the value favored by @xcite for @xmath62 kpc according to measurements of the proper motion of sgr a@xmath63 ) and maintaining the flat rotation curve out to iras  00420@xmath15530  and w3(oh ) reduces the radial ( toward the galactic center ) component of the anomalous velocity by only @xmath46 km s@xmath10 , without substantially changing the orbital component .",
    "the anomaly is even less sensitive to adjusting _ both _ the orbital speed and @xmath61 in such a way as to keep the _",
    "angular _ speed ( @xmath64 ) of the solar lsr constant @xcite .",
    "this insensitivity is a result of the relatively small angle ( @xmath411@xmath14 ) subtended at the galactic center by the sun and iras  00420@xmath15530 , and that this angle changes very slowly for a fixed distance to iras  00420@xmath15530  ( our measurement ) over the plausible range of @xmath61 ( 8 @xmath36 1 kpc ) . introducing a difference in nominal orbital speed between the sun and these sources sufficient to account for the anomaly is also implausible , implying zero additional mass outside the solar circle , and would not compensate for the radial component of the anomaly . finally , a sufficient correction to just the solar peculiar motion would require a change to the radial component of @xmath420 km s@xmath10 , entirely inconsistent with the hipparcos measurements of @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that we have failed to model a large internal motion of the h@xmath0o  masers in iras  00420@xmath15530  that happens to lie in the direction of the apparent anomalous motion , a possibility noted by @xcite for w3(oh ) .",
    "however , we consider this unlikely given the relatively modest range of three - dimensional velocities observed for the main h@xmath0o  masers in iras  00420@xmath15530 , and that they are near ( @xmath65 5 km s@xmath10 ) the systemic velocity indicated by other molecular species in iras  00420@xmath15530 .",
    "the maser channel chosen for this analysis ( region 3 , @xmath66 km s@xmath10 ) is reasonably representative of the available information for iras  00420@xmath15530 .",
    "other choices are possible , but either can be excluded on grounds of insufficient constraints or do not substantively change the result .",
    "the maser regions excluded from the parallax analysis have proper motion estimates biased toward more negative velocities in longitude due to poor sampling of the parallax ellipse in the late epochs . of the remaining 16 well - sampled maser channels used in the parallax analysis , only region",
    "9 differs in the longitude component of its proper motion by more than @xmath45 km s@xmath10  ( at the longitude of iras  00420@xmath15530 , equatorial and galactic coordinates are approximately parallel , so @xmath67 ) .",
    "the dispersion in the latitude component is somewhat larger , but it is irrelevant to the space velocity analysis within the galactic plane .",
    "region 9 has a velocity in longitude @xmath425 km s@xmath10  more negative than region 3 . alternatively choosing region 9 as representative ameliorates the anomaly in the circular orbital component of the velocity found in the above analysis for region 3 quite well , but also _ increases _ the anomalous component in the direction of the galactic center .",

    "* ) are necessary to resolve such issues conclusively , and establish the true bulk motion of material in the perseus spiral arm .",
    "such observations could possibly also better constrain the galactic orbital speed and solar peculiar motion , but will be limited by the isotropy and homogeneity ( i.e. , the apparent lack of galactic axisymmetry ) of the available sample .",

    "they find a distance for ngc  281 of 2.82@xmath360.24 kpc , 650 pc further than iras  00420@xmath15530 , and postulate that these sources lie on opposite sides of the surface of an hi super - bubble that is expanding out of the plane of the galaxy .",

    ", the space velocity of iras  00420@xmath15530  shows a substantial anomalous component in the direction of the sun , consistent with similar observations of w3(oh ) , implying a significant non - circular systematic motion of the perseus spiral arm of the galaxy .",
    "parallax observations of larger samples of maser sources using the vlba have the potential to extend the distance estimates of a few % accuracy to a large fraction of the galaxy , and will contribute to more accurate non - axisymmetric models of galactic rotation .",
