    "it is a challenging problem to determine the order of the phase transition in the physical system where the order changes from the first order to the second one by a small variation of a parameter of the system .",
    "it is important to know how the quantities that remain finite at the first order transition point diverge or vanish when the parameter approaches the point at which the transition changes to the second order one .",
    "the @xmath0-state potts model@xcite in two dimensions gives a good place to investigate the properties of the phase transition around such a point .",
    "it exhibits the first order phase transition for @xmath2 and the second order one for @xmath4 .",
    "many quantities of this model at the phase transition point @xmath5 are known exactly for @xmath2 , including the latent heat@xcite and the correlation length@xcite , which vanishes and diverges , respectively , in the limit @xmath6 .",
    "one the other hand physically important quantities such as the specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility at the transition point , which also increase to infinity as @xmath6 , are not solved exactly .",
    "et al._@xcite made a stimulating conjecture on the asymptotic behavior of the energy cumulants including the specific heat at the first order transition point ; the relation between the energy cumulants and the correlation in their asymptotic behavior at the first order transition point for @xmath6 will be the same as their relation in the second order phase transition for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which is well known from their critical exponents .",
    "if this conjecture is true not only in the @xmath0-state potts model but also in other general physical systems with a phase transition whose order change from the first order to the second one when some parameter of the system is varied , it would give a good guide in investigating such systems .",
    "bhattacharya _ et al._@xcite also made the large-@xmath0 expansion of the energy cumulants to order 10 in @xmath9 and they analyzed the series according to the conjecture , giving the estimates of the cumulants at the first order transition point for @xmath10 .",
    "the obtained estimates are at least one order of magnitude better than those given by other methods such as the monte carlo simulations@xcite and the low-(and high-)temperature expansions@xcite , in spite of the fact that the maximum size of the diagrams taken into account in their large-@xmath0 expansion is less than the correlation length for @xmath11 while the monte carlo simulations are done carefully on the lattice with its size about 30 times as large as the correlation length and also the fact that the maximum size of the diagrams in their large-@xmath0 expansion is as small as the half of the maximum size of the diagrams in the low-(and high-)temperature expansions these strongly suggest the correctness of the conjecture .",
    "the large-@xmath0 series obtained by them are , however , not long enough to investigate the behavior of the energy cumulants for @xmath0 closer to @xmath12 .    in this paper we will enlarge the large-@xmath0 series for the energy cumulants at the transition point to order of 21 or 23 in @xmath13 using the finite lattice method@xcite , instead of the standard diagrammatic method used by bhattacharya _",
    "et al._. the finite lattice method can in general give longer series than those generated by the diagrammatic method especially in lower spatial dimensions . in the diagrammatic method , one has to list up all the relevant diagrams and count the number they appear . in the finite lattice method",
    "we can skip this job and reduce the main work to the calculation of the expansion of the partition function for a series of finite size lattices , which can be done using the straightforward site - by - site integration@xcite without the diagrammatic technique .",
    "this method has been used mainly to generate the low- and high - temperature series in statistical systems and the strong coupling series in lattice gauge theory .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to demonstrate that this method is also applicable to the series expansion with respect to the parameter other than the temperature or the coupling constant .",
    "the long large-@xmath0 series obtained here by the finite lattice method enables us to examine the conjecture by bhattacharya _",
    "_ on the asymptotic behavior of the energy cumulants for @xmath0 very close to 4 .",
    "we can also give the estimates of the energy cumulants for each @xmath14 that are orders of magnitude more precise than the estimates by the previous works and they would serve as a target in investigating this model in various contexts , for example in testing the efficiency of a new algorithm of the numerical simulation . a brief note on this subject",
    "was already presented in @xcite , where we concentrated only on the specific heat .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the algorithm of the finite lattice method to generate the large-@xmath0 expansion of the free energy are given for the disordered phase in section 2 and for the ordered phase in section 3 .",
    "the relation between the two algorithm is also discussed in section 3 .",
    "the obtained series for the energy cumulants at the phase transition points are presented in section 4 . in section 5",
    "the series are analyzed to investigate the asymptotic behavior of the cumulants at @xmath6 as well as to make the estimation of the cumulants at various values of @xmath2 . in section 6",
    "we conclude with a brief summary and a few remarks .",
    "the model is defined by the partition function @xmath15 where @xmath16 represents the pair of nearest neighbor sites and @xmath17 takes the values @xmath18 . the phase transition point @xmath19",
    "is given by @xmath20 .",
    "we first consider the free energy density in the disordered phase , which is given by @xmath21 here the partition function @xmath22 in the disordered phase should be calculated for the @xmath23 lattice with the free boundary condition as depicted in fig.1 .",

    "the @xmath31 is called the _ activity _ of @xmath27 .",
    "it is useful to note that the activity can be rewritten as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of independent closed loops formed by the bonds in @xmath27 .",
    "we define @xmath34 for each @xmath35 lattice ( @xmath36 ) as @xmath37}\\ ; , \\label{eq : h}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the partition function for the @xmath35 lattice , again with the free boundary condition as shown in fig.1 .",
    "we next define @xmath39 recursively as @xmath40 here the term with @xmath41 and @xmath42 should be excluded in the summation .",
    "then the free energy density defined by eq.([eq : free_energy ] ) is given by@xcite @xmath43    now we have to know from what order in @xmath13 the @xmath39 starts . only for this purpose ,",
    "let us suppose to apply the standard cluster expansion@xcite based on the diagrams the large-@xmath0 expansion for the free energy in the disordered phase .",
    "it should be stressed that in the practical calculation of the finite lattice method we need not perform this cluster expansion at all .",
    "a _ polymer _ is defined as a set @xmath27 of bonds which satisfies the condition that there is no division of @xmath27 into two sets @xmath44 and @xmath45 so that @xmath46 . a set @xmath27 composed of a single bond",
    "is a polymer .",
    "below in this paragraph we discuss on the polymers that consists of two or more bonds .",
    "now we define a _ cluster of bonds _ in @xmath27 so that two bonds that are connected by a site belong to the same cluster .",
    "a polymer consisting of two or more bonds is composed of a single cluster of bonds , since a set of bonds composed of more than one disconnected clusters of bonds apparently does not satisfy the condition of a polymer .",
    "a cluster of bonds is a polymer if and only if the cluster of the bonds can not be divided into tow or more clusters of bonds by cutting at any site that is shared by the bonds belonging to the cluster .",
    "we call such a cluster of bonds as _ one - site irreducible_. in fact for a set @xmath47 consisting of a _ one - site reducible _ cluster of bonds that can be divided into clusters @xmath48 of bonds by cutting at a site , we have @xmath49 , which implies that this set of bonds is not a polymer . for a cluster of bonds to be one - site irreducible , it is necessary that the bonds should form one or more closed loops and that each bond should belong to at least one of the loops , which we call _ closed_. an example of a closed cluster of bonds is shown in fig.2(a ) . for each closed cluster of bonds , the loop of the bonds which forms the perimeter of the whole cluster",
    "is called the _ exterior boundary_. the exterior boundary for the closed cluster of bonds in fig.2(a ) is indicated in fig.2(b ) .",
    "an _ interior boundary _ is a loop inside which all bonds are removed and we call the part of the cluster surrounded by the interior boundary as a _ hole_. the closed cluster of bonds in fig.2(a ) has a hole with the interior boundary , as indicated in fig.2(c ) . for a cluster of bonds to be one - site irreducible , not only should it be closed but also its exterior boundary has no crossing .",
    "if the exterior boundary has a crossing , as in fig.3 , the cluster of bonds is one - site reducible and is not a polymer .",
    "thus a polymer is the closed cluster of bonds with its exterior boundary having no crossing .",
    "we list as an illustration in fig.4 all the polymers that can be embedded within @xmath50 lattice with their activities .",
    "the polymers are skipped that can be obtained by rotating and/or reflecting those in fig.4 . for later convenience",
    "we add some definitions concerning a polymer .",
    "a _ concave corner _ in the boundary of a polymer is the part of the boundary composed of two neighboring bonds that are bent perpendicular to each other toward the interior of the polymer . if two neighboring corners on the boundary are both concave , we call the two corners together with the bonds in a straight line connecting the two corners as a _ concave part _ of the boundary",
    ". examples of the concave parts are given in fig.5 .",
    "according to the theorem of the standard cluster expansion@xcite , the free energy for the @xmath51 lattice is given by @xmath52 where the summation should be taken for every cluster of _ connected _ polymers @xmath53 defined by the condition that there is no division of the cluster of polymers @xmath53 into two clusters of polymers @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) so that @xmath57 .",
    "( the ` cluster ' of polymers here should be distinguished from the ` cluster ' of sites in the fortuin - kasteleyn representation or the ` cluster ' of bonds defined in the explanation of the polymers above . )",
    "the @xmath58 in eq.([eq : clusterx ] ) is the numerical factor that depends on the way how the clusters of polymers are connected , the details of which are not necessary here .",
    "when a cluster of connected polymers can be embedded into the @xmath35 lattice but can not be embedded into any of its rectangular sub - lattices , we call it shortly to _ fit into _ the @xmath35 lattice . then we can prove the theorem@xcite that the taylor expansion of the @xmath39 with respect to @xmath13 includes the contribution from all the clusters of polymers in the standard cluster expansion that fit into the @xmath35 lattice .",
    "now , according to this theorem , we can know the order of @xmath39 in @xmath13 by examining the clusters of connected polymers that fit into the @xmath35 lattice .",
    "we first note that @xmath59 since the @xmath60 lattice consists of a single site with no bond , so that no polymer can be embedded into this lattice , and @xmath61 since the @xmath62 or @xmath63 lattice consists of two sites connected by one bond , so that a polymer composed of a single bond can be embedded into this lattice .",
    "we also note that @xmath64 for @xmath65 or @xmath66 , because the corresponding lattice consists of the sites connected by bonds all on a straight line and the only clusters of polymers that fit into the lattice are those with each polymer composed only of a single bond and these polymers are not connected according to the definition of the connected polymers .",
    "we next consider the order of @xmath39 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we first consider a cluster consisting of a single polymer that fits into the @xmath35 lattice .",
    "if the polymer has a concave part in its exterior boundary we can add some bonds to make the part flat , obtaining a new polymer whose activity is changed by a factor of @xmath69 with @xmath70 the number of added bonds , so its order in @xmath13 is lowered .",
    "this implies that a polymer that has concave part in the exterior boundary does not contribute to the lowest order term of @xmath39 in @xmath13 .",
    "let us next consider the case when the polymer has some holes .",
    "the interior boundary surrounding each hole has at least one concave part .",
    "( we take the hole as the exterior of the polymer when we say ` concave ' here . )",
    "we can add some bonds to make the concave part flat , again obtaining a new polymer with the order of its activity in @xmath13 lowered by a factor of @xmath71 .",
    "this implies that a polymer that has a hole does not contribute to the lowest order term of @xmath39 in @xmath13 .",
    "thus the remaining polymers that have neither a concave part on the exterior boundary nor a hole in the interior give the contribution to the lowest order term of @xmath39 , examples of which are shown in fig.6 .",
    "they can be converted into each other by adding or removing pairs of bonds to their concave corners or from their convex corners , respectively .",
    "when each pair of bonds is added or removed the activity of the polymer is changed by @xmath72 with its order in @xmath13 unchanged . hence we see that their orders are all the same ; that is , the order of @xmath73 .",
    "next we consider a cluster of connected tow or more polymers that fits into the lattice .",
    "it is enough to take into account the clusters of polymers that do not have either a concave part on the boundary or a hole in the interior , since we are going to know the clusters of connected polymers that contributes to the lowest order term in @xmath13 . among the clusters of connected two or three polymers that fit into the lattice , those give the lowest order contribution in which the polymers touch each other only through their exterior boundary and each neighboring pair of polymers share only one bond , like fig.7(a ) , and this type of clusters",
    "have the order of @xmath74 for the cluster of @xmath70 polymers ( @xmath75 ) , which is higher than the lowest order contribution from the clusters composed of a single polymer .",
    "we note that a cluster of two or three polymers in which each neighboring pair of polymers share only one site , an example of which is given in fig.7(b ) , is not connected according to the definition of the connected polymers . among the cluster of connected more than four or more polymers that fit into the lattice ,",
    "those give the lowest order contribution in which four of the polymers surround a plaquette and each neighboring pair of polymers share only one site , like fig.8 , and this type of clusters have the order of @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) for the cluster of @xmath70 polymers , which is also higher than the lowest order contribution from the clusters composed of a single polymer . in summary the lowest order term of @xmath39",
    "has the order of @xmath73 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which comes from the clusters of a single polymer without a hole or a concave part fitting into @xmath51 lattice .",
    "thus in order to obtain the series to order @xmath78 for the free energy density , we have only to take into account in eq.([eq : f ] ) all the rectangular lattices that satisfy @xmath79 .",

    "thus if we try the pad approximation of @xmath163 it will lead to a convergent result for @xmath164 , while the approximants will scatter when @xmath166 is off this value . in the pad approximation of @xmath163 the series for the ordered and disordered phases should be treated in a slightly different way , corresponding to the difference of the lowest order of the series ; the series for the ordered phase starts from the order of @xmath167 , while the series for the disordered phase starts from the order of @xmath13 .",
    "thus we should solve the following equation : @xmath168 where @xmath169 is 2 for the ordered phase and 1 for the disordered phase , and @xmath170 and @xmath171 are polynomials of order @xmath172 and @xmath173 respectively with @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the truncated order of the series .",
    "fig.11 is the result of this analysis of @xmath176 for @xmath7 .",
    "we see very clearly that the pad approximants have the best convergence at @xmath177 and the convergence becomes bad rapidly when @xmath166 leaves this value .",
    "all the other approximants for @xmath178 have similar behaviors with respect to @xmath166 with the best convergence at @xmath164 , although we do not show them in figures .",
    "these results are enough to convince us that @xmath179 has the asymptotic behavior that is proportional to @xmath180 .",
    "then we calculate the amplitude of @xmath162 for each @xmath0 by taking the pad approximants of @xmath181 and multiplying @xmath182 that is calculated from its exact expression .",
    "usually a diagonal approximant ( that is , @xmath183 ) or it s neighborhood produces good estimates .",
    "we , however , adopt here all the approximants with @xmath184 and @xmath185 , since we have found in this case that each of these approximants is scattered almost randomly around their average value and we have found no reason to give a special position only to the diagonal approximant .",
    "some denominators of the approximants have zero at @xmath186 ( @xmath2 ) and we have excluded such approximants .",
    "the results for @xmath187 in the ordered and disordered phases are listed in table 36 for integer values of @xmath188 , with the second energy cumulant transformed to the specific heat by multiplying @xmath189 . in figs .",
    "12 - 16 , we also plot @xmath190 versus @xmath138 for @xmath19126 , respectively . in these figures",
    "the dotted and dashed lines indicate the errors for the disordered and ordered phases , respectively . in these tables and",
    "figures the given errors represent the magnitude of the fluctuation in the data of the pad approximants .    in any case",
    ", the estimates have surprisingly high accuracy .",
    "our data are orders of magnitude more precise than the result of the monte carlo simulation by janke and kappler@xcite for @xmath192 ( also listed in table 36 ) , which was performed carefully in large enough lattices checking the finite size effects , and they are consistent with each other except for small differences in the data of the 5th and 6th cumulants for the ordered phase . on the other hand , the results of the low - temperature series@xcite ( also listed in table 3 and 4 ) are inconsistent with these .",
    "this would be because we do not have the correct knowledge ( or conjecture ) of the possible singularity structure of the cumulants at some @xmath193 in extrapolating the low - temperature series toward @xmath5 .",
    "we should emphasize that the values of the specific heat has an accuracy of about 0.1 percent at @xmath158 where the correlation length is as large as 2500 lattice spacing@xcite and there is no previous data to be compared with , and of a few percent even at the limit of @xmath7 where the correlation length diverges .",
    "the accuracy is better by a factor of more than 10 when compared with the result of using the pad approximation for @xmath194 .",
    "the reason for this is the following .",
    "let us suppose that the pad approximants gives estimates of @xmath195 and @xmath196 , then the estimate of @xmath162 from the former would also have an ambiguity factor of @xmath197 , while the estimate of @xmath162 from the latter would have an ambiguity factor of @xmath198 , which grows up for the plus sign and shrinks to zero for the minus sign when @xmath199 .",
    "next we determine the constant @xmath142 and @xmath112 in the asymptotic form ( [ eq : asymp_form ] ) for @xmath135 .",
    "the constants @xmath142 can be determined by the value of @xmath153 in the limit of @xmath135 .",
    "we read from fig.12 that @xmath200 on the other hand , the constant @xmath143 is given by the asymptotic value of the following combination for @xmath201 : @xmath202 their asymptotic values should be common to each @xmath70 .",
    "the behavior of the quantity in eq.([eq : constant_b ] ) for the ordered and disordered phases are given in fig.17 and 18 respectively .",
    "the graphs for @xmath203 and @xmath204 show clear convergence even at @xmath205 giving the value of @xmath143 very close to each other , that is , @xmath206 we also notice that , although the results for @xmath207 and @xmath208 have considerably large errors in the small @xmath138 region so we can not say anything definite , the values of the quantity in eq.([eq : constant_b ] ) at the points where the errors begin to grow are also close to this value of 0.38(3 ) .",
    "thus we may estimate the constant @xmath143 as @xmath209 in conclusion the pad data of the large-@xmath0 series convince us that the conjecture ( [ eq : asymp_form ] ) for the asymptotic form is true at least for @xmath75 and @xmath12 and suggest its correctness for @xmath207 and @xmath210 .",
    "the finite lattice method were applied to generate the large-@xmath0 expansion of the @xmath70-th energy cumulants ( @xmath211 ) at the phase transition point for the ordered and disordered phases in the two - dimensional @xmath0-state potts model .",
    "it enabled us to extend the series to the 23rd order in @xmath212 for @xmath125 and to the 21st order for @xmath127 from the 10th order generated by bhattacharya _",
    "_ using the standard diagrammatic method .",
    "we made the pad analysis of the series for the product of each cumulant and some powers of the latent heat that is expected to be a smooth function of @xmath13 if the conjecture by bhattacharya _ et al .",
    "_ is true that the relation between the cumulants and the correlation length in the asymptotic behavior for @xmath213 at @xmath7 will be kept in their asymptotic behavior at the first order transition point for @xmath135 .",
    "it allowed us to present very precise estimates of the cumulants at the transition point for @xmath2 .",
    "the accuracy of the estimates is orders of magnitude higher than the results of the monte carlo simulations and the low-(and high- ) temperature series for @xmath214 , and for instance of about 0.1 percent at @xmath158 where the correlation length is as large as a few thousand lattice spacing and there is no previous data to be compared with , and of a few percent even at the limit of @xmath7 where the correlation length diverges .",
    "the resulting asymptotic behavior of the cumulants for @xmath0 close to 4 is consistent with the conjecture not only for the second cumulant ( or the specific heat ) but also for the higher cumulants .",
    "now it is quite natural to ask whether the conjecture by bhattacharya _",
    "_ for the energy cumulants can be extended to other quantities such as the magnetization cumulants at the first order phase transition point that diverge in the limit of @xmath135 .",
    "we can expect that the long series of the large-@xmath0 expansion for the quantities would serve to answer this question as the long series for the energy cumulants did in this paper .",
    "it is rather straightforward to extend the large-@xmath0 expansion by the finite lattice method to such quantities .",
    "they are obtained in general by the derivative of the free energy density in the presence of appropriate external fields or sources , which can also be given by the algorithm of the finite lattice method described in this paper with a minor modification . since",
    "no duality relation is known for the free energy density in the presence of the external fields , both of the algorithms presented here for the ordered and disordered phases will be useful , especially in what type of the boundary condition one should adopt for the finite size lattices .",
