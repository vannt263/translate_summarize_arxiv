    "it is well - known that conformal symmetry plays important role in both critical phenomena and the superstring theory .",
    "nevertheless , in particle physics in four dimensional space - time dimension , conformal symmetry is broken by the masses of the particles explicitly , and even though there is conformal symmetry classically , this symmetry would be broken by the renormalization effect . however , at high energy scale , there could exist stuff with notrivial scale invariance in the infrared(such as the banks - zaks field@xcite ) , which is recently suggested by howard georgi as a component of the beyond standard model(sm ) physics above the tev scale@xcite .",
    "since unparticle stuff is completely new to us , and we do nt have a picture of what the unparticle looks like , and the theories with notrivial ir fixed point is very complex , georgi have used the method of the low energy effective field theory to study the unparticle stuff production@xcite and the peculiar virtual effects in high energy processes@xcite .",
    "moreover , the the unparticle production in @xmath1 , mono - jet production , the virtual effects of the unparticle in the drell - yan process and the muon anomaly have been investigated@xcite , and the fermionic unparticles are introduced as well@xcite .",
    "unparticle physics have very interesting and rich phenomenological consequences . in this paper",
    ", we shall explore the phenomenological consequences of unparticle in deep inelastic scattering(dis ) in the framework of the effective field theory .",
    "we follow closely the scenario studied in@xcite .",
    "the fields of the theory with notrivial ir fixed point are denoted as @xmath2 fields , and the sm fields and the @xmath2 fields interact through the exchanges of particles with a high mass scale @xmath3 .",
    "thus , below the high scale @xmath3 , the effective norenormalizable couplings between them are follows , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the local operators built up of sm fields and the @xmath2 fields .",
    "furthermore , below the scale @xmath7 where the scale invariance in the @xmath2 sector emerges , the @xmath2 operator @xmath6 is matched onto the unparticle operator @xmath8 , and eq.([1 ] ) is matched onto the effective interactions between the sm fields and the unparticle fields of the following form , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath0 are respectively the scale dimensions of the local operators @xmath6 and @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the coefficient function which is determined by the matching processes .",
    "the following effective interactions of interesting phenomenologies have been introduced in @xcite , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the gluon field strength , @xmath15 denotes the sm fermion fields , and universal coupling between the unparticles and the sm fermionic fields has been assumed .",
    "@xmath8 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the scalar , vector and tensor unparticle operators .",
    "they are taken to be hermitian and the latter two operators are assumed to be transverse .",
    "naively @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 should be of the same order .",
    "the interactions in eq.([3 ] ) are generally weak , moreover the first two couplings in eq.([3 ] ) are suppressed by @xmath22 in comparison with the latter two , so the latter two effective interactions is dominant in the dis processes with virtual unparticle exchange . and we should work to the lowest order in the small couplings of unpartile fields with the sm fields in the effective theory .",
    "similar to ref.@xcite the following dimensionless coefficients are introduced for convenience , @xmath23    following ref.@xcite , by conformal symmetry , we have , @xmath24 where @xmath25 which is normalized with respect to the phase space of @xmath0 massless particles , and the two - point correlation function of the unparticle operator @xmath26 can be obtained as follows , @xmath27 similarly , @xmath28    the above propagator factor has been obtained independently by georgi@xcite and cheung",
    "_ et al.,_@xcite .",
    "since the effective interaction between the unparticle fields and the sm fermions in eq.([3 ] ) is flavor - conserving , which is consistent with the suppressed flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) transitions , the unparticle will only affect the neutral current ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) exchange dis processes @xmath31 , which is shown in fig.1 . for the charged lepton scattering @xmath32 , the differential scattering cross section is , @xmath33\\ ] ]        [ fig1 ]    where @xmath34(i=1,2,3 ) is the structure functions which measure the structure of the target , and @xmath35\\;b^{\\ell}_q(q^2)\\\\ \\nonumber f^{\\ell}_2(x , q^2)&=&\\sum_{q}x\\;[q(x)+\\overline{q}(x)]\\;c^{\\ell}_q(q^2)\\\\ \\label{9}f^{\\ell}_3(x , q^2)&=&\\sum_{q}[q(x)-\\overline{q}(x)]\\;d^{\\ell}_q(q^2)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath36 in eq.([add2]-[11 ] ) , @xmath37 is the weinberg angle @xmath38@xcite , @xmath39 is the mass of the @xmath40 gauge boson @xmath41gev@xcite , and @xmath42 , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the electric charge of the fermion @xmath15 in unit of the positron electric charge @xmath45 .",
