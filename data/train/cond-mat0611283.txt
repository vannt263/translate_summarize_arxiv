    "brownian motors are spatially asymmetric constructions that , operating under nonequilibrium conditions , can rectify thermal fluctuations .",
    "they have been the object of intense study over the past 15 years @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we make the connection with another active field of research , namely granular matter @xcite . in such systems , particles undergo dissipative colllisions and are , by construction , in nonequilibrium .",
    "we therefore generically expect that a brownian motor will arise if we break spatial symmetry in granular matter . to investigate this question in more detail , we propose here a minimal model , which has the advantage that the resulting systematic speed can be calculated exactly .",
    "we bypass the difficulties associated to the granular gas itself by assuming that the collisions between the gasparticles are elastic and that the gas is extremely diluted ( ideal gas limit ) . both spatial asymmetry and dissipation",
    "are introduced by considering an asymmetric object which undergoes dissipative collisions with the surrounding particles .",
    "the outcome of our calculations is that the predicted speeds are quite large , namely comparable to the thermal speed , and should therefore be easily observable in experiment .",
    "an asymmetric object , for example a triangle , is free to move , however without rotation , along a horizontal axis , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . its motion , with speed denoted by @xmath0 , is induced by dissipative collisions with surrounding particles . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a two - dimensional system and assume that these particles are an ideal gas initially at equilibrium at temperature @xmath1 in an infinitely large container .",
    "hence the spatial distribution of the particles is uniform outside the object and their velocity distribution is maxwellian .",
    "note that post - collisional particles are no longer at equilibrium .",
    "however , in the limit of infinite dilution , recollisions with the ( convex ) object do not take place and the hypothesis of molecular chaos ( no correlations between the speed of the object and that of the particles prior to collisions ) is valid .",
    "the following boltzmann - master equation is therefore a microscopically exact starting point , describing the time evolution of the probabilitiy density @xmath2 : @xmath3.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] @xmath4 is the transition probability per unit time that the object ( mass @xmath5 ) changes speed from @xmath0 to @xmath6 , due to collisions with the surrounding particles ( mass @xmath7 ) .",
    "its explicit expression has to be derived from the laws of dissipative collisions , taking into account the geometrical configuration of the object . to remain consistent with the molecular chaos assumption , we restrict ourselves to convex objects .",
    "the latter can be fully characterized by the shape probability function @xmath8 , defined so that @xmath9 is the fraction of the outer surface with polar angle between @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the total circumference will be denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "the object is constrained to move along a specific direction , say the @xmath13-axis , and its velocity is then @xmath14 .",
    "the velocity components of the particle are denoted by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and primes will be used to denote post - collisional speeds .",
    "since there are no external forces in the @xmath13-direction , the corresponding component of the total momentum is conserved under collision : @xmath17 furthermore , the interaction force is assumed to be orthogonal to the surface at the point of impact , implying that the tangential speed component of the impinging particle is also conserved : @xmath18 finally , the dissipative collision reduces the relative velocity orthogonal to the surface by a factor @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , the so - called normal restitution coefficient : @xmath21 the tangent and orthogonal unit vectors at the surface with polar angle @xmath10 are @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .    . ]",
    "the above equations determine uniquely the post - collisional speeds in terms of the pre - collisional ones .",
    "in particular , the change of speed @xmath24 of the object reads : @xmath25 the transition rate @xmath4 , which is the probability per unit time for such a change of speed , is thus given by :    @xmath26\\left\\vert ( \\vec{v}-\\vec{v})\\cdot   \\hat{n}\\right\\vert   \\\\",
    "\\times \\rho   \\phi(v_{x},v_{y } ) \\delta\\left[u-(1+r)\\frac{m\\sin^{2}\\theta}{m\\sin^{2}\\theta+m}(v_{x}-v - v_{y}\\cot   \\theta)\\right]\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 $ ] denotes the heaviside function .",
    "@xmath28 is the density of the gas and @xmath29 the velocity distribution of the granular gas , taken to be a maxwellian : @xmath30 the integrals over the speed of the colliding gas particles can be performed explicitly , so that @xmath4 reads : @xmath31\\int_{0}^{\\pi}+u\\theta[u]\\int_{\\pi}^{2\\pi}\\right){\\mathrm{d}}\\theta f(\\theta ) \\\\   \\times\\frac{(m\\sin^{2}\\theta+m)^{2}}{(1+r)^{2}m^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta}\\exp   \\left[-\\frac{m\\sin^{2}\\theta}{2kt}\\left(v+\\frac{u(m\\sin^{2}\\theta+m)}{(1+r)m\\sin^{2}\\theta}\\right)^{2}\\right]\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    the remaining integral depends on the shape probability function of the object .",
    "the model introduced above can be considered as a granular variant of a thermal brownian motor @xcite . for the calculation of the resulting average drift velocity",
    ", we can proceed along lines similar to those described in @xcite , yielding an expansion for the stationary average drift velocity in terms of the small ratio @xmath32 .",
    "the main steps of the calculation are presented in the appendix .",

    "the object reaches a state of thermal equilibrium with the surrounding gas , that is @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for dissipative collisions , the object obviously does not equilibrate .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath40 , one verifies that the velocity of the object is still maxwellian , but at an ( lower ) effective temperature @xmath41 . as a result , there is a continuous flow of energy ( heat ) from the gas into the object .",
    "this energy flow , in conjuction with the spatial asymmetry , is the driving mechanims for its systematic motion .",
    "the direction of the motion is determined by the geometry .",
    "turning to a specific example and for later comparison with the simulations , we consider an isocleses triangle with apex angle @xmath42 .",
    "the shape probability function is : @xmath43\\sin\\theta_{0}+\\delta\\left[\\theta-\\theta_{0}\\right]\\\\+\\delta\\left[\\theta-(\\pi-\\theta_{0})\\right ]   \\big)\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and : @xmath44 the expressions for @xmath33 and @xmath34 now become :    @xmath45   + \\ldots\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    and @xmath46+\\ldots.\\ ] ]    we conclude that the triangle has an average negative speed : it always moves opposite to the direction in which it points ( @xmath47 $ ] ) !",
    "the average speed goes to zero , consistent with the fact that the motion is produced by fluctuations , when the mass ratio @xmath48 goes to zero .",
    "it becomes a maximum in the limit of high dissipation @xmath49 and maximum asymmetry @xmath50 .    for comparison with these theoretical results",
    ", we have performed stochastic simulations to generate trajectories of the master equation .",
    "the highly efficient algorithm is based upon exact acceptance - rejection methods for generating the maxwellian inflow distribution @xcite ; see the appendix c in @xcite for a complete description of the algorithm .",
    "averages were taken over 40 000 realizations , with each realization taking 100 000 time steps .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "agreement between theory and simulations is excellent .",
    "deviations are observed , as expected , when the mass ratio @xmath48 becomes smaller , but a surprisingly good agreement persists even for @xmath5 of the order of @xmath7 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .     of the triangle in a ) as a function of the angle @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) and",
    "b ) as a function of the temperature ( @xmath53 ) . in both cases we set @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . ]",
    "according to our theoretical result , the speed of the granular motor is of the order of the thermal speed @xmath58 and should therefore be easily observable .",
    "there are however a number of critical comments to be made concerning its experimental observation .",
    "first , one needs to address the fluctuations in velocity . considering for simplicity the case of extreme dissipation and asymmetry",
    ", one finds @xmath59 .",
    "we conclude that even for a mass ratio @xmath60 , r.m.s .",
    "speed fluctuations are still 10 times larger than the average speed . only for extremely light motors",
    "( @xmath61 according to the now less reliable prediction of the perturbative result ) will fluctuations be of the same order as the average speed .",
    "this difficulty can of course be circumvented , either by taking enough sample trajectories , or by measuring the displacement for a time much longer than the correlation time of the velocity fluctuations .",
    "second , the average speed is the result of a subtle unbalance between the collisions on different sides of the object .",
    "we therefore expect that the resulting systematic speed will depend sensitively on the velocity distribution that is used to describe the surrounding gas particles .",
    "for example , in the case of a driven granular gas , the velocity distribution can deviate strongly from the maxwellian form and moreover depends significantly on the thermostat being used ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "furthermore , a temperature anisotropy can appear in a granular gas because of the unidirectional energy input @xcite . as a consequence , experimental observed velocities , using granular gases with a non - maxwellian velocity distribution ,",
    "are expected to yield significant deviations from the theoretical values predicted here .",
    "deviations from a maxwellian distribtuion can however be addressed by repeating the above calculations with the appropriate velocity distribution .",
    "such calculations reveal that the average speed is typically of the same order of magnitude , although the detailed dependence on the shape of the object may be quite different .",
    "finally , we note that the discussion presented here is dealing with a two - dimensional system .",
    "the analysis can be reproduced with similar results for the case of three dimensions .",
    "we thank r. brito for communicating results on molecular dynamics simulations of the model presented here .",
    "since we should recover equipartition in absence of dissipation , we expect that the kinetic energy of the motor is of the order of @xmath62 .",
    "it is therefore convenient to switch to the dimensionless quantity @xmath13 of order @xmath63 , defined as : @xmath64 the master equation is equivalent with the following set of coupled equations , describing the time evolution of the moments @xmath65 : @xmath66 with @xmath67 the so - called jump moment , defined as : @xmath68        @xmath69\\phi\\left[1+\\frac{n}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{{\\varepsilon}^{2}x^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta}{2}\\right]+\\sqrt{2 }   { \\varepsilon}x \\sin\\theta   \\gamma\\left[\\frac{3+n}{2}\\right]\\phi\\left[\\frac{3+n}{2},\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{{\\varepsilon}^{2}x^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta}{2}\\right]\\right).\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    the function @xmath70 $ ] is the kummer function .",
    "this new set of equations are fully coupled and equally difficult to solve as the original master equation .",
    "however , the equations decouple in the limit @xmath71 .",
    "indeed , using the following series expansions : @xmath72&\\approx &   1+(2+n)z^{2}+\\frac{1}{6}(8 + 6n+n^{2})z^{4}+ ... \\\\ \\phi\\left[\\frac{n+3}{2},\\frac{3}{2},z^{2}\\right]&\\approx &   1+\\frac{1}{3}(3+n)z^{2}+\\frac{1}{30}(15 + 8n+n^{2})z^{4}+ ... \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one finds : @xmath73 and : @xmath74    the expressions ( [ av ] ) and ( [ av2 ] ) for @xmath33 and @xmath34 are now readily obtained , by solving the equations for the first two moments @xmath75 and @xmath76 at the steady state up to order @xmath77 ."
