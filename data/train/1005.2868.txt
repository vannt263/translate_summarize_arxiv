    "observations of high - redshift supernovae of type  ia @xcite , along with observations of the cosmic microwave background @xcite , indicate a flat universe with an accelerating expansion .",
    "the existing evidence is consistent with a universe that is dominated today by a cosmological constant term in the einstein s theory of gravity , however , due to fine tuning required in this model , several alternative explanations have been suggested @xcite .",
    "if we phenomenologically treat this unknown energy component as an ideal fluid  called the dark energy  then the pressure of this fluid has to be negative , that is , for an equation of state @xmath0 , we have @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in this description the cosmological constant model has an equation of state given by @xmath3 , and thus we expect that a phenomenological modeling of the cosmological data with a constant @xmath4 should give @xmath5 , which turns out to be the case ; the current data indicating one - third of the total density in the form of dark and baryonic matter and two - thirds in the form of the cosmological constant  a model that is known as the @xmath6cdm model .",
    "however , it should be noted that the equation of state for the dark energy could differ from @xmath7 in the past when the dark energy is expected to be subdominant ( for consistency with constraints arising from the observations of the microwave background ) .",
    "indeed , in many plausible models of dark energy the equation of state approaches @xmath7 only in the recent past and thus may show only tiny departures from @xmath7 at low redshifts , while at high redshifts it might remain subdominant and therefore would have a weaker observational signature .",
    "although it is perhaps hard to extend supernova ( sn ) observations beyond @xmath8 or so , neutral hydrogen observations of the post - reionization epoch may be able to provide constraints on dark energy all the way up to @xmath9 @xcite .    to resolve this issue we require data that is precise enough to discern tiny variations in the dark energy .",
    "it is also required that data be available at a large number of redshifts to constrain the detailed temporal behaviour of dark energy . at present the only data that comes reasonably close to these requirements is provided by the observations of the high redshift type ia supernovae ( sne ) , which are believed to be standard candles",
    " a claim that may be doubtful considering the relatively poorly understood physics , and the possibility of physical mechanisms such as dust in the inter - galactic medium that systematically dims them .",
    "another concern is that the sn data sets are usually collated from several different experiments that might have slightly different systematics , due either to instrumental effects or the fact that they observe different directions in the sky ; for example systematic errors in correcting galactic or source galaxy dust extinction might leave residual anisotropies in data .",
    "these considerations imply that to obtain precise information about the behaviour of dark energy we should first have a good knowledge of the statistical properties of sne , both random as well as systematic .",
    "the standard model of cosmology is based on the cosmological principle @xcite , which states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales .",
    "recent work provides some evidence for what is known as the hubble bubble @xcite indicating that we might be living inside a large void that has a different value of the hubble constant inside from what is outside the bubble .",
    "there is evidence for such large scale voids in the cmb maps as well @xcite , suggesting that such large voids are not implausible .",
    "there is no reason for us to believe that we are living at the precise centre of such a void .",
    "therefore , if we happen to be living in such a void then various distance measures , such as the luminosity distance and the angular diameter distance , may not be isotropic .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter gsl08 ) used the extreme value statistics to show that the two sn data sets , @xcite ( gd04 ) and @xcite ( gd07 ) , do show some evidence for direction dependence .",
    "several other works have also indicated either systematic problems with the high - redshift sn data or directional dependence in the sn data and other probes @xcite .",
    "we recently found that our analysis in gsl08 contained mistakes due to a coding error . in this paper",
    "our main task is 1 ) to provide revised results and to extend the previous work by introducing a statistic that marginalises over the hubble parameter instead of using its best fit value 2 ) to introduce a new statistic that has a greater sensitivity to the signatures of living off - centre inside a large void .",
    "we also give asymptotic form for this statistic , which makes it easier to use it for large data sets .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we introduce the likelihood function marginalised over the hubble constant and provide a comparison with what we obtain using the bayesian statistic . in ",
    "3 we introduce the two statistics . in   4 we present our results and   5 we end with conclusions .",
    "for a given sn the measured quantity , the distance modulus @xmath12 , is the difference between the apparent and the absolute magnitude @xmath13 where the apparent magnitude @xmath14 is a function of the intrinsic luminosity of a sn , the redshift @xmath15 and the cosmological parameters ; and @xmath11 is the absolute magnitude of a type  ia sn .",
    "the distance modulus can be expressed in terms of the luminosity distance @xmath16 as @xmath17 + 25\\ , , \\label{eq : mu}\\ ] ] where the luminosity distance is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 , and thus depends only on the cosmological parameters ; the matter density @xmath20 and the dark energy density @xmath21 .",
    "the prescription for the variation of dark energy with redshift has to be specified separately .",
    "for example , in the @xmath6cdm model the energy density in the dark energy @xmath22 remains a constant . in eq  [ eq : mu1 ] the dependence of the measured quantity @xmath12 on @xmath11 is linear .",
    "since @xmath12 depends on the logarithm of the luminosity distance it is clear that @xmath12 depends linearly on the logarithm of the hubble parameter @xmath10 .",
    "usually the data are given in terms of eq  [ eq : mu ] , where the constant @xmath11 has already been marginalised over .",
    "thus , instead of two nuisance parameters we are left with only one  the hubble constant @xmath10 .",
    "the hubble parameter could in principle be measured using the observations of the low - redshift distance - redshift relationship , however , the quantities of real interest are the cosmological parameter @xmath20 and @xmath21 . thus it would be useful to marginalise over the nuisance parameter @xmath10 .",
    "although this can be done numerically while estimating the cosmological parameters , it turns out that our statistic in   3.2 does not allow this .",
    "it is clear that the hubble constant term can be eliminated by considering the difference of two magnitudes @xmath23\\,.\\ ] ] if the error on @xmath24 is @xmath25 then the standard error for @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 , where we have assumed that the errors on the two magnitudes are statistically independent .",
    "if we have a large number , @xmath28 , of sne in the sample then dividing it into two equal halves we can form @xmath29 such differences ( assuming an even @xmath28 ) , and estimate parameters that would be independent of @xmath10 . however , the degrees of freedom reduce by half in this process , thereby reducing the amount of information that can be extracted from data . another reason for our not choosing this method",
    "is the fact that we are interested in quantifying direction dependence in data and therefore our statistics depend on the direction each sn is observed .",
    "specifically , we consider statistics that depend on the difference of quantities computed on the opposite hemispheres and then maximizing this difference over all the directions .",
    "it is clear that such a procedure does not allow the use of above method .    for marginalisation",
    "we instead use a method that is based on subtracting the magnitude of an arbitrarily chosen low - redshift ( so its magnitude depends only on the hubble constant ) anchor sn from the magnitudes of sne in a data set and then marginalising over magnitude of anchor sn .",
    "the resulting likelihood function is derived in the appendix .",
    "this is equivalent to marginalising over the nuisance parameter @xmath10 with a gaussian prior centered around its value derived from the anchor sn , alongwith the corresponding standard deviation .",
    "the method can be easily generalized to a case where the priors on @xmath10 are specified separately as described in the appendix .",
    "we now compare the analytically marginalised likelihood function in eq  [ eq : marglik ] to the results of bayesian marginalisation over @xmath10 . for this purpose",
    "we consider parameter estimation for gd04 .",
    "we assume a flat @xmath6cdm universe for this exercise .",
    "the dimensionless hubble parameter is given by @xmath30 and flatness implies @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the only free parameters are @xmath10 and @xmath20",
    ". the normalized likelihood function is given by @xmath32 here @xmath33 , where the subscript @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the covariance matrix .",
    "the superscript t denotes the matrix operation of taking the transpose of a matrix .",
    "the posterior probability for parameters @xmath20 and @xmath10 is given by @xmath36 we choose a uniform prior for @xmath20 in the range @xmath37 and for @xmath38 in the range @xmath39 .",
    "the marginalised probability distribution for the matter density is given by @xmath40 the probability density is normalized after carrying out the integration .",
    "a similar probability density function for the matter density can be obtained by the bayesian inversion of the marginalised likelihood function given in eq .",
    "figure  [ fig : comparison ] plots a comparison between the two probability densities and shows that the two distributions are nearly identical .     with the analytic marginalisation",
    "according to the likelihood function in eq  [ eq : marglik ] .",
    "the two are indistinguishable . , scaledwidth=50.0% ]     sne , whose positions on the sky were generated randomly .",
    "there was a mistake in a similar figure in gsl08 where the discrepancy between these distributions was larger .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "for completeness some details are repeated here from gsl08 . for our analysis",
    "we have considered a flat @xmath6cdm universe , which can be easily generalized to a more general model of dark energy .",
    "we consider subsets of the full data set to construct our statistic comprising @xmath42 data points . for analytic marginalisation",
    "we keep two anchor sne aside .",
    "since the @xmath6cdm model fits the gold data sets gd04 and gd07 well , we first obtain the best fit to the _ full gold data sets _ using the marginalised likelihood function given in eq  [ eq : marglik ] , and then for each sn we calculate the residuals , which is free of @xmath10 by virtue of eq  [ eq : diffmu ] . the standard error for a sn at redshift @xmath43 is @xmath44 , and we assume that the errors on sne are statistically uncorrelated .",
    "we define @xmath45 , where the marginalised @xmath46 is defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : mchisq ] .",
    "@xmath47 indicates the statistical scatter of the subset from the best fit @xmath6cdm model .",
    "its expectation value is unity ( see appendix for a proof ) , that is @xmath48 .",
    "we divide the data into two hemispheres labeled by the direction vector @xmath49 , and take the difference of the @xmath50 computed for the two hemispheres separately to obtain @xmath51 , where label 1 corresponds to that hemisphere towards which the direction vector @xmath49 points and label 2 refers to the opposite hemisphere .",
    "we take the absolute value of @xmath52 since we are interested in the largest magnitude of this quantity .",
    "we then vary the direction @xmath49 across the sky to obtain the maximum absolute difference @xmath53    as shown in gsl08 , the distribution of @xmath41 follows a simple , two parameter gumbel distribution , characteristic of extreme value distribution type  i @xcite , @xmath54\\,\\exp\\left [ -\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta_{\\chi^2 } -m}{s}\\right)\\right]\\,\\,,\\ ] ] where the position parameter @xmath55 and the scale parameter @xmath56 completely determine the distribution . to quantify departures from isotropy we need to know the theoretical distribution , which is calculated numerically by simulating several sets of gaussian distributed @xmath57 on the gold set sn positions and obtaining @xmath41 from each realization . for comparison with theory",
    "we follow gsl08 and compute a bootstrap distribution by shuffling the data values @xmath43 , @xmath58 and @xmath44 over the sne positions ( for further details see gsl08 ) .",
    "as mentioned in gsl08 , the above procedure separates the data sets into hot and cold sne that have large and small dispersions with respect to the best fit model .",
    "however , note that these two sets could still indicate the same cosmology , albeit with a different value of @xmath59 . to ameliorate this deficiency",
    "we now introduce a new statistic that does not suffer from this artifact .      as mentioned above , @xmath61 does not contain information about whether the sn is above or below the fit . an obvious generalization that does contain information regarding whether the sn at a redshift is closer or farther from us can be obtained by considering a statistic based on @xmath57s .",
    "we consider two subsets of data defined by two hemispheres labeled by the direction vector @xmath49 , containing @xmath62 and @xmath63 sne , where the total number of sne , @xmath64 , and define the quantity @xmath65 clearly @xmath66 and @xmath67 . from the central limit theorem @xcite it follows that for @xmath68 , the quantity @xmath69 follows a gaussian distribution with a zero mean and unit variance . as in the previous case",
    "we maximize this quantity by varying the direction @xmath49 across the sky to obtain the maximum absolute difference @xmath70    unlike the @xmath41 statistic this statistic is not marginalised over the hubble constant since our results show that marginalising over it instead of using its best fit value has only a marginal effect on @xmath41 . moreover , in the limit @xmath68 , and assuming a uniform sky coverage",
    ", we expect the two hemispheres to contain roughly an equal number of sne . in this case",
    "it is clear that @xmath60 would depend only weakly on @xmath10 .",
    "this statistic differs from the previous one in that the @xmath60 statistic has a theoretical limit where the position and the shape parameters can be determined analytically .",
    "given @xmath71 independent directions on the sky we are essentially determining the maximum of a sample of size @xmath71 where the individual numbers are drawn from a gaussian distribution with a zero mean and unit variance . in the limit",
    "@xmath72 the parameters are given by @xcite @xmath73 where we have to additionally assume that the number of sne @xmath74 , since the distribution for @xmath75 becomes gaussian only in this limit .",
    "this is convenient since at least for large data sets , which will be available in the future , a comparison with theory becomes simpler .",
    "however , for a smaller number of sne there is a possibility that not all directions are independent , in fact , it is quite possible that two directions contain exactly same subsets in the two hemisphere . in this situation",
    "is is clear that the total independent directions is a smaller number than @xmath71 and thus theoretical distribution would be rightward shifted and also more sharply peaked .",
    "for this reason we also calculate the bootstrap distribution and the theoretical distribution in the same manner as for the previous statistic .",
    "statistic . theoretical distribution is shifted to the left compared to what we find for our simulated data in figure  [ fig : sim ] , which uses gaussian deviates suggesting evidence for non - gaussianity.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     statistic .",
    "theoretical distribution is compatible with figure  [ fig : sim ] for the simulated data , which implies gaussianity for the residuals .",
    "the @xmath41 for gd07 is within one sigma of the mode and thus the data are consistent with isotropy . , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in gsl08 we discussed a specific bias in the bootstrap distribution , showing that it is shifted slightly to the left of the theoretical distribution due to the fact that theoretical distribution is obtained by assuming @xmath57s to be gaussian random variates with a zero mean and unit variance .",
    "theoretical @xmath57s are unbounded , however the bootstrap distribution is obtained by shuffling through a _ specific realization _ of @xmath57 where the @xmath57s are obviously bounded .",
    "it is clear that on the average this should produce slightly smaller values of @xmath41 in comparison to what one expects from a gaussian distributed @xmath57s .",
    "the same problem persists in the hubble constant marginalised version of @xmath41 .    however , the analysis in gsl08 had a numerical bug that produced a mismatch between the bootstrap and theoretical distributions that is worse than what one obtains upon correction .",
    "therefore , for reference we plot the results for a new simulation in figure  [ fig : sim ] with a total of @xmath76 sne .",
    "this may be compared with figure  3 of gsl08 .",
    "the discrepancy has been reduced after correction .",
    "our results in this paper should be interpreted with respect to figure  [ fig : sim ] in this paper .",
    "concerns regarding the small number of sne in data sets and its effect on the efficacy of our method can be addressed ( as in gsl08 ) by noting that this figure is produced with only @xmath76 sne and the theoretical and the bootstrap distributions look similar .      .",
    "the model parameters for gd04 and gd07 are tabulated here .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ appendix ]",
    "the normalized likelihood function for the distance modulus is given by @xmath77 here @xmath78 , where the subscript @xmath79 and @xmath35 is the covariance matrix .",
    "the superscript t denotes the matrix operation of taking the transpose .",
    "each modulus has a linear constant term containing a combination of parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 , therefore , we wish to consider the difference of two moduli to explicitly remove it . for concreteness",
    "we choose the @xmath80 sn as the anchor point , subtract its modulus from all others , and marginalise over it .",
    "we first define these new parameters @xmath81 as follows .",
    "@xmath82 where the transformation matrix @xmath83 the inverse transformation is @xmath84 noting that @xmath85 , in terms of the new variables , the likelihood function is given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "we now integrate over @xmath88 to obtain the marginalised likelihood function , @xmath89 where , the final covariance matrix @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 where the indices @xmath92 run from @xmath93 to @xmath28 . to formulate our estimator for @xmath10 marginalised statistic we require the marginalised @xmath46 defined as follows @xmath94 we note that the expectation value of @xmath95 as shown below @xmath96 in this formulation the marginalisation is carried out using one of the sn data points .",
    "however , it is easy to see that the method is more general and we can marginalise over any gaussian prior on the hubble parameter . to achieve this we note that at low redshifts the luminosity distance takes the approximate form @xmath97 . thus , it is possible to produce a theoretical luminosity distance at low redshifts with appropriate error bars if we are given gaussian priors on the hubble parameter and the absolute magnitude for type  ia sne .",
    "if we use this theoretically produced magnitude and replace the @xmath80 sn with it then we can marginalise over any arbitrary priors on the hubble parameter .",
