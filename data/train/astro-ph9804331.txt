    "after 31 years since the discovery of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , the origin of such brief gamma - ray flashes remains unknown .",
    "the observed isotropy of grbs in the sky , could only be explained by theoretical models where grbs originate either in a extended halo around the galaxy or arise from sources at cosmological distances . before the launch of the bepposax satellite , the poor localization capability of the grb detectors made the searches at other wavelengths unfruitful .",
    "the breakthrough took place in 1997 when the first x - ray afterglows were observed by the bepposax , rxte , rosat and asca satellites ( costa et al .",
    "1997 , heise et al . 1997a ,",
    "marshall et al .",
    "1997 , greiner et al .",
    "1998 , murakami 1998 ) .",
    "they were able to localize the fading x - ray emission that followed the more energetic gamma - ray photons once the grb event had ended .",
    "this emission ( the afterglow ) extends to longer wavelengths , and the good accuracy in the position determination by bepposax ( typically @xmath6 radius error boxes ) has led to the discovery of the first optical counterparts for grb 970228 ( van paradijs et al .",
    "1997 , guarnieri et al .",
    "1997 ) , and grb 970508 ( bond 1997 , djorgovski et al .",
    "1997 , castro - tirado et al .",
    "1998 ) , greatly improving our understanding of these puzzling sources .",
    "the measurement of the redshift for the grb 970508 optical counterpart ( metzger et al .",
    "1997 ) has established that one grb , maybe all , lie at cosmological distances .",
    "grb 971214 is the third grb with a known optical counterpart .",
    "it was detected by the bepposax gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm , frontera et al .",
    "1997 ) on dec 14.97 1997 , as a 25 s long - structured gamma - ray burst .",
    "simultaneous to the detection of the gbm , the wide field cameras ( wfc , jager et al .",
    "1997 ) on board bepposax provided an accurate position ( a @xmath7 radius error box at a 3@xmath8 confidence level , heise et al .",
    "1997b ) that allowed deep optical , infrared and radio observations .",
    "the position was also consistent with the one given by the all - sky monitor on rxte ( bradt et al .",
    "1993 ) and by the batse / ulysses annulus ( kippen et al .",
    "when bepposax pointed its narrow - field instruments ( nfi ) to the grb position , on dec 15.25 ( @xmath1 6.5 hours after the burst ) , a previously unknown variable x - ray source was found inside the wfc error box ( antonelli et al .",
    "1997 ) which was identified as the x - ray afterglow of grb 971214 .",
    "soon after , halpern et al .",
    "( 1997 ) reported the presence of a fading object inside the wfc grb error box , based on two i - band images separated 24 hours .",
    "the object was afterwards confirmed as the counterpart of grb 971214 by means of additional observations at other wavelengths : r - band ( castander et al .",
    "1997 , diercks et al .",
    "1998 ) , i - band ( rhoads 1997 ) and j - band ( tanvir et al . 1997 ) .",
    "no detections in the k - band were reported in the literature , although observations performed on dec 15.54 imposed an upper limit of k @xmath9 18.5 ( garcia et al .",
    "as it will be explained later , this upper limit will be used to constraint the power - law index @xmath10 and the position of the possible maximum of the light curve .",
    "we report here the detection of the grb 971214 counterpart in the near infrared ( ir ) by means of two k@xmath0-band images taken at calar alto on dec 15.12 and 15.18 ( mean observing time , only @xmath13.5 and @xmath15 hours after the gamma - ray event ) .",
    "the second image is almost simultaneous to the beginning of the observations performed by the bepposax narrow - field instruments .",
    "we discuss whether our observations are in agreement with the extrapolation of the power - law seen at other bands in later epochs .",
    "the observations were obtained in the k@xmath0-band ( wainscoat and cowie 1992 ) with the 3.5-m telescope ( equipped with omega ) at the german - spanish calar alto observatory .",
    "omega is a near - ir detector with a 1024 @xmath11 1024 pixel hgcdte array .",
    "the image scale is 0.4@xmath12/pixel giving a field of view of 6.8 @xmath11 6.8 arcminutes ( bizenberger et al .",
    "each image consists of 20 different frames forming a mosaic on the sky in order to avoid problems due to bad pixels and cosmic rays .",
    "each frame is the co - addition of 10 images ( 3-second exposure time each ) , see table [ table1 ] for details .",
    "the two sets of mosaics were started @xmath13 and @xmath14 hours after the grb . unfortunately no observations could be obtained on dec 16 ( the day after our measurements ) due to bad weather thus preventing a prompt identification of the near - ir counterpart .",
    ".log of calar alto observations for grb 971214 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ , > \" , ]     images were calibrated using the ukirt faint standard fs17 ( casali and hawarden 1992 ) , which was imaged immediately after the first grb mosaic . since",
    "a k - standard star was used in the calibration , the value of k - k@xmath0 measured for the grb depends upon the difference in spectral shape between the standard star and the grb transient . since the transient is fairly blue ( optical spectral index @xmath1 0 ) like the standard star , then k - k@xmath150 also for the transient .",
    "in fact , the maximum error in the value of k - k@xmath0 is @xmath16 magnitudes ( wainscoat and cowie 1992 ) , i.e. not significant compared to the other photometric errors . the optical transient reported by halpern et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is clearly detected in both images , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , over the limit ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the short time span between both observations ( @xmath1 1.5 hours ) makes it difficult the calculation of the slope of the light curve .",
    "photometry of the object  yields k@xmath0=@xmath2 for the first observation and k@xmath0=@xmath3 for the second one .",
    "therefore the brightness difference between @xmath13.5 and @xmath15 hours after the burst is @xmath19k@xmath20 magnitudes .",
    "astrometry  of  the  near - ir counterpart gives @xmath21 ( equinox 2000.0 ) , which is consistent with the optical position reported by halpern et al .",
    "prompt follow up observations are extremely important in order to monitor the grb afterglow at early stages , which enables to test the validity of the different afterglow models .",
    "in fact , we know now that afterglows are not always remnants of the initial burst ( see piro et al .",
    "1998 ) . observations performed shortly after the grbs , allowed to measure the delay between the gamma - ray and the optical emissions in grb 970228 and grb 970508 , for which the optical maxima were reached 0.7 and 2 days after the gamma - ray event , respectively .",
    "this appears not to be the case for grb 971214 , for which no optical maximum was detected according to optical observations started only @xmath112 hours after the gamma - ray emission ( halpern et al .",
    "therefore the analysis of the k@xmath0-band data presented in this study , collected @xmath13.5 and @xmath15 hours after the event , is crucial in order to determine whether a delayed emission , at other wavelengths , following grb 971214 was present .      our observations in the k@xmath0-band",
    "complete the measurements for the grb 971214 afterglow at other wavelengths ( j , i , r and x - rays ) and are almost simultaneous to the observation performed with the nfi on board bepposax , @xmath16.5 hours after the burst ( antonelli et al .",
    "this fact enables us to calculate the near - ir to x - ray ( 2 - 10 kev ) flux ratio 5 - 6.5 hours after the grb , @xmath22 . taking into account the measurements performed at other wavelengths on dec 15.44 - 15.51 , and extrapolating our second observation with power - law decays ranging from @xmath23 to @xmath24 , the measured rough broad - band spectrum ( ir - optical ) of the grb 971214 afterglow can be obtained ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . as it can be seen in this figure ,",
    "the shape of the measured flux density distribution @xmath25 vs @xmath26 depends on the power - law index assumed for the @xmath27 light curve .",
    "thus , if @xmath28 the multiwavelength spectrum of the grb 971214 afterglow would show a maximum in the near - ir . this possible maximum around the j - band has not been detected in previous multiwavelength spectra of grb 971214 due to the lack of measurements in the @xmath29-band ( reichart 1998 ) .",
    "according to the fireball models , the afterglow radiation will shift progressively to lower frequencies and the corresponding timescales will lengthen ( katz and piran 1997 ) . therefore , the k@xmath0-band measurements impose , over the available data , the most stringent limits to a possible maximum in the light curve of the grb 971214 afterglow .",
    "three possible light curve shapes can fit our data : a rising light curve ( case 1 ) similar to that detected for grb 970228 ( guarnieri et al .",
    "1997 , pedichini et al .",
    "1997 ) and grb 970508 ( pedersen et al .",
    "1998 , galama et al . 1998 ) , a plateau phase ( case 2 ) , as it was seen in grb 970508 between @xmath1 4 and @xmath1 24 hours after the burst ( castro - tirado et al . 1998 ) , or a power - law decay ( case 3 ) as it was later reported for both grb 970228 ( galama et al . 1997 ) and grb 970508 ( sokolov et al . 1998 ) .      in case of a rising light curve ( case 1 ) or a plateau ( case 2 )",
    "the light curve could not extend , following the same trend , until dec 15.54 , giving the upper limit of k @xmath9 18.5 imposed by garcia et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "even an increasing curve until a time near dec 15.54 followed by a very sharp bending over would be unrealistic .",
    "we have estimated the acceptable time for this turning in the following way : first we have assumed that the light curve displayed a plateau phase ( at k@xmath30 ) from dec 15.18 onwards ; then we have constructed a curve with a power - law decline index @xmath24 that matches the garcia et al .",
    "( 1997 ) measurement on dec 15.54 .",
    "the intersection between the constant light curve ( initial phase ) at k@xmath0=18.0 and the power - law fading light curve provides an upper limit for the time of the turnover point , t@xmath31 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if we assume an increasing light curve crossing our two data points at dec 15.12 and dec 15.18 , the intersection with the power - law @xmath24 would move slightly backwards .",
    "lower values of @xmath10 would also give lower values of t@xmath31 in all cases .",
    "we have not considered larger ( unrealistic ) values of @xmath10 .",
    "so , we conclude that the possible maximum or turning point took place t@xmath31=10.2 hours after the gamma - ray event , at the latest .",
    "if we assumed a single - fading light curve ( case 3 ) with a power - law decline in the near - ir with index @xmath32 ( as used by waxman ( 1997 ) and similar to the other two optical counterparts ) a variation @xmath19k@xmath0 between our images taken @xmath11.5 hours apart of @xmath19k@xmath33 magnitudes would be expected .",
    "however , our data imply a magnitude difference @xmath19k@xmath34 , which is @xmath35 from the above mentioned prediction derived from the @xmath32 power - law ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "if the assumed power - law index were @xmath36 the rejection level would be @xmath37 , being necessary a power - law index @xmath38 ( too unrealistic ) in order to find a disagreement at a @xmath39 level between our points and the prediction of a power - law decay .",
    "the power - law light curve connecting our second measurement @xmath15.0 hours after the gamma - ray event and the upper limit imposed by garcia et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , would have an index @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , power - law decays with indices @xmath40 are ruled out , because they imply a magnitude @xmath41 on dec 15.54 , which would be above the reported upper limit .",
    "we have detected the grb 971214 near - ir counterpart @xmath13.5 hours and @xmath15 hours after the gamma - ray event which enables to conclude that :    \\i ) a magnitude difference @xmath19k@xmath42 is derived from our measurements , whereas @xmath19k@xmath43 would be expected assuming a power - law decay with index @xmath44 ( similar to the one observed at optical wavelengths ) .",
    "this implies a deviation of @xmath35 .",
    "if the assumed power - law index @xmath10 were 1.4 , then the rejection level would be @xmath37 .",
    "thus , our measurements suggest a rising or a flat light curve segment with a duration @xmath4 hours ( between 3.5 and 10.2 hours after the burst ) . this conclusion must be taken with care since the above - mentioned rejection levels are not stringent enough to assure the result with total confidence ;    \\ii ) the power - law decline in the near - ir should be steeper than the one given by @xmath5 ;    \\iii ) for the observations carried out on dec 15.44 - 15.51 , there is a change in the slope of the measured energy distribution at some wavelength between the j and k@xmath0 bands ( possibly around h ) .",
