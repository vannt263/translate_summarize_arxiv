    "a microscopic , coordinate space model to analyse proton scattering from nuclei has been developed  @xcite from that formed earlier by the hamburg group  @xcite . with this model ,",
    "analyses have been made of 200 mev proton elastic scattering from a large number of nuclei  @xcite , of elastic and inelastic p@xmath6c scattering over a range of incident energies  @xcite , of charge exchange reactions  @xcite , of the structure of neutron rich nuclei such as @xmath7he  @xcite and @xmath8li  @xcite , and , very recently , of proton scattering from @xmath9he  @xcite .",
    "those light mass systems usually have been considered as few  body problems and the data analysed with few  body methods .",
    "we note also that microscopic model analyses determined within a momentum space framework for elastic proton scattering have been made , with varying degrees of success  @xcite .",
    "the energies considered by these microscopic analyses ( both in coordinate and momentum space ) lie in a ` transition ' region between low and intermediate energies .",
    "for such energies , effects of nonlocalities in the effective nucleon  nucleus ( @xmath10 ) interaction must be taken into account . also for these energies ,",
    "medium dependent effects in the nucleon ",
    "nucleon ( @xmath11 ) effective interaction upon which that @xmath10 interaction is built , are important . when these two facets are taken into account in our coordinate space approach , good to excellent agreement with data",
    "is found to measured elastic and inelastic scattering cross sections , analyzing powers and other spin measureables  @xcite .",
    "the optical potentials are formed by folding the complex effective interaction with nuclear one body density matrix elements ( obdme ) and a set of single particle ( sp ) bound state functions .",
    "for very light nuclei , modern shell model studies  @xcite not only specify the obdme but also which sp wave functions should be used . using this information , calculations of both electron scattering form factors and proton elastic scattering observables become predictive ; the latter especially when",
    "the effective interaction and folding procedure are fixed .",
    "otherwise , one can use fits to the longitudinal elastic electron scattering form factor to specify the sp wave functions one should use in the @xmath10 scattering calculations .",
    "those @xmath10 calculations then remain predictive as there is no adjustable quantity left . for heavier nuclei ( a @xmath12 16 ) , shell model calculations to date",
    "have been made only within @xmath13 space .",
    "therefore we have not used electron scattering form factor analyses to select a definitive set of sp wave functions",
    ". however , experience suggests  @xcite that harmonic oscillator ( ho ) functions with oscillator lengths following a simple mass rule ( @xmath14 ) should suffice .",
    "whatever the choice of structure input , the folding process leads to @xmath10 optical potentials that are nonlocal because of exchange ( antisymmetry ) contributions . in our model ,",
    "antisymmetrization of the proton  target system has been taken at the two  body level only ,",
    "i.e. we have used a fully antisymmetrized @xmath15nucleon target wave function and antisymmetrized each projectile  target nucleon pair . in the past ,",
    "the resultant nonlocality of the optical potential either was ignored or was approximated by an equivalent local form  @xcite .",
    "our calculations of 200 mev proton  nucleus ( @xmath16 ) scattering gave excellent predictions of observables but only when the complete integro ",
    "differential forms of schrdinger equations were used  @xcite .    as with our study at 200 mev",
    ", we consider herein only the elastic scattering channel but take the spin rotation , @xmath17 , into account along with the cross sections , @xmath18 , and analyzing powers , @xmath19 .",
    "specifically we have considered 50 targets , namely the @xmath20shell nuclei @xmath21li , @xmath22b , @xmath6c , and @xmath23o ; the @xmath24shell nuclei @xmath25ne , @xmath26 mg , @xmath27si , and @xmath28s ; the @xmath24 proton@xmath29 neutron shell nucleus , @xmath30ar ; the @xmath31shell @xmath32ca , @xmath33ti , @xmath34cr , @xmath35fe , @xmath36co , and @xmath37ni ; the @xmath38 neutron shell nuclei @xmath39y , @xmath40zr , @xmath41mo , and @xmath42sn ; the lanthanide nuclei , @xmath43sm , @xmath44gd , @xmath45dy , @xmath46er and @xmath47yb ; the @xmath48 proton@xmath49 neutron shell nuclei @xmath50hf , @xmath51w , and @xmath52os ; the mass 200 nuclei , @xmath53pb and @xmath54bi ; and the actinide pair , @xmath55th and @xmath1u .",
    "our predictions of elastic scattering from these diverse mass targets are compared with 65 mev data in all cases with the exception of @xmath8li ; the experimental data for which come from the elastic scattering of radioactive beams of those lithium isotopes from hydrogen .",
    "inverse kinematics makes those experiments equivalent to 60 and 62 mev protons scattering from @xmath56li and @xmath22li , respectively .",
    "we compare predictions obtained from the optical potentials defined for each target with the proton elastic scattering data that is available , but only to 80@xmath57 in the centre of mass . in general ,",
    "the cross  section magnitudes by that scattering angle are typically @xmath58  mb / sr .",
    "we do not expect the approximations needed to make our model practical would be appropriate necessarily in making a prediction of the scattering of lesser magnitude .",

    "we develop first the folding procedure by which the nonlocal optical potentials are specified . from those ,",

    "we seek solutions for @xmath10 scattering and determine the nonlocal interactions , @xmath66 , at 65 mev in particular , by folding effective @xmath10 interactions with the relevant structure information .",
    "thus we obtain the appropriate @xmath10 effective interaction for each nucleus in our investigation from @xmath0li to @xmath1u . at this particular energy",
    "one may anticipate stronger influences in analyses of the medium effects defining the effective @xmath11 interactions and of the nonlocalities in the optical potentials arising from the folding process than in studies of 200 mev scattering  @xcite . with",
    "the optical potential in this coordinate space representation , we use the program dwba91  @xcite to solve the set of partial wave integro ",
    "differential schrdinger equations .",
    "that code has the further useful attribute that it can be used to evaluate distorted wave born approximated ( dwba ) amplitudes for inelastic scattering , given the appropriate obdme and sp wave functions .",
    "the microscopic optical potentials are used therein to determine the distorted waves and the medium modified effective @xmath11 interaction is used as the transition operator .",
    "data from inelastic scattering of 200 mev protons from @xmath67li and @xmath6c have been well reproduced by using that procedure  @xcite further justifying the scattering theory formulated in coordinate space .    to define the nonlocal interaction for @xmath10 scattering in a full folding model",
    ", we must accommodate antisymmetry between the projectile and every nucleon specified with the internal nuclear wave function .",
    "we must evaluate multi  particle matrix elements of the form @xmath68 with @xmath69 being the many ",
    "body wave function for the ground state of the target and ` 0 ' denoting the projectile coordinates .",
    "as all nucleons in the target are equivalent , it is useful to choose a specific entry ( `` 1 '' ) and write @xmath70 with the many  body state expanded in cofactors , @xmath71 where @xmath72 specifies the set @xmath73 , and @xmath74 is the isospin projection , eq .",
    "( [ eq : u_multi ] ) becomes @xmath75 when the required antisymmetry with projectile and struck nucleon is taken into account .",
    "the nuclear structure information required to evaluate the optical potentials are many  body matrix elements of the particle  hole operators .",

    "if @xmath80 is nonzero , multipoles from 0 to @xmath81 contribute .",
    "scattering from light odd mass targets show that these must be included  @xcite . as",
    "even  even nuclei all have ground state spin  parities ( @xmath82 ) of @xmath83 , the required obdme simply are the monopoles @xmath84 ^ 0 \\right\\| \\psi_{0 } \\right\\rangle \\;.\\ ] ] while the angular momentum selection rules require @xmath85 and @xmath86 , there is no such restriction on the principle quantum number .",

    "the diagonal elements reduce to the shell occupancies as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the fractional shell occupancy as a fully occupied shell has @xmath90 .",

    "one then applies the partial wave expansions , eq .",
    "( [ eq : wexpand ] ) .",
    "a feature in our process of analysis is that all details required to make the calculations are preset . in the cases of @xmath67li  @xcite and of @xmath6c  @xcite , nuclear structure information was taken from shell model calculations in complete multi-@xmath96 spaces with the sp wave functions set by fits to the longitudinal elastic electron scattering form factors .",
    "thus the results for both the elastic and inelastic scattering of 200 mev protons from those nuclei were obtained from single calculations .",
    "no adjustments ( such as those attributed to core polarizations ) were needed and most proton excitation data were well described . with the microscopic ( coordinate space ) model for 200 mev @xmath16 scattering established for a set of @xmath20shell nuclei , an extensive analysis for many more nuclei with masses up to @xmath53pb was completed  @xcite . in almost all cases single calculations led to excellent reproduction of data .",
    "most recently  @xcite , wave functions from very large space shell model calculations of @xmath97he were used in successful predictions of the elastic scattering of 200 mev protons from that few nucleon system . in that case the shell model interaction used also fixed the sp wave functions so the analysis of the electron scattering form factor was also predictive .      the folding procedure to define the optical potential requires the specification of the @xmath11 effective interaction in @xmath98-channel form and in coordinate space .",

    "shell @xmath4 matrices for laboratory energies between 50 and 400 mev  @xcite .",

    "details of the techniques involved are given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "given that the @xmath11 @xmath4 matrices are most easily specified in momentum space and the effective interaction form is an approximation , it is sensible to seek to analyse @xmath10 elastic scattering with a momentum space solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "such studies have been made using credible @xmath4 matrices as input  @xcite and those results reflect reasonable agreement with the data .",

    "the major effect of medium modifications ( pauli blocking and energy denominators ) are to vary the on  shell values .",
    "the choice of the yukawa forms for the effective interaction is extremely advantageous when it comes to evaluating the optical potential .",
    "fourier transformation of each of the radial components of the effective @xmath11 interactions gives a simple multipole form , so that for the central terms , the double bessel transformation that leads to each term in the nonlocal interaction can be solved analytically , taking the form @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the lesser and greater of @xmath117 and @xmath118 respectively .",
    "there are diverse observables for the scattering of polarized protons from an unpolarised target .",
    "while one may define differing sets , we consider that which involves differential cross section , @xmath119 , analyzing power , @xmath19 , and two wolfenstein spin rotations , @xmath15 and @xmath17 .",
    "these measureables are defined in terms of scattering amplitudes @xmath120  @xcite .",
    "since the data we investigate were obtained using polarized projectile protons , this amplitude is a @xmath121 matrix , @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 here @xmath125 are the rotation matrices , @xmath126 are the coulomb phase shifts , @xmath127 is the point coulomb scattering amplitude , and @xmath128 are the @xmath129 matrices for @xmath130 . with these , the elastic scattering observables are defined as @xmath131 @xmath132 @xmath133 and @xmath134 commonly @xmath135 , a linear combination of the wolfenstein spin rotations , is measured .",
    "it relates to the above by @xmath136",
    "in the following subsections , we display the results of our calculations of the elastic scattering of 65 mev protons from many target nuclei and place them in comparison with experimental data wherever such data exist .",
    "the results are subdivided into four sections .",
    "first , we present the scattering from the light nuclei , @xmath137li to @xmath23o , for which obdme have been obtained mostly from large space shell model calculations and for which sp wave functions have been determined from fits to the longitudinal elastic electron scattering form factors .",
    "then we present and discuss the results obtained with medium mass nuclei , from @xmath25ne to @xmath138ni . for those nuclei",
    "the shell model calculations were performed in complete @xmath13 spaces , except for those in the middle of the @xmath139 shell where the dimension of the basis becomes prohibitively large for matrix diagonalization techniques . in those cases , a restriction on the number of nucleons in the @xmath140 orbit was placed on the model . the oscillator length for the ho sp wave functions used was set as @xmath3 ( in units of fm ) . in the third section , we present the results for the scattering from heavy nuclei , and in which the nucleon occupancies are those given by a simple packing model .",
    "again we use ho wave functions with an oscillator length given by @xmath3  fm as the sp functions . in the final section ,",
    "we consider the changing structure of the observables across the mass range",
    ".    for each of the cases discussed , we present the results of two calculations .",
    "they differ only in the specification of the optical potential .",
    "the results obtained with the effective interaction built from the @xmath11 @xmath4 matrices folded with known density profiles  @xcite are displayed by the solid curves while those found by using the free @xmath11 @xmath5 matrices are displayed by the dashed curves .",
    "for simplicity we designate the results as being obtained from calculations made using @xmath4folding and @xmath5folding potentials respectively .",
    "the data come from refs .",
    "@xcite with specific reference made in the figure captions .",

    "the target is identified in each segment of the diagrams .",
    "the ground state wave functions were obtained , for the most part , from shell model calculations made within a complete @xmath142 model space .",
    "the exceptions were @xmath67li , for which the wave functions were obtained in a complete @xmath143 space  @xcite .",
    "the sp wave functions were assumed to be of woods ",
    "saxon ( ws ) form and were chosen to reproduce the longitudinal elastic electron scattering form factor data .",
    "for @xmath23o , ho functions were used .",

    "[ li67911 ] . in the case of @xmath0li ,",
    "our prediction of the cross section made with the @xmath4folding potential has the correct shape but it is slightly weaker than the data .",
    "this is not the case at 200  mev @xcite , where the data are well reproduced .",
    "the slight discrepancy at the lower energy may be a consequence of the deformation of the target and the failure of the shell model , even in the @xmath143 space , to reproduce the cluster nature of the @xmath0li nucleus  @xcite . yet , although @xmath0li does not have a large central density , the changes as a result of the medium modifications contained in the @xmath4 matrix are quite significant .",
    "this is observed in comparison to the results obtained using the @xmath5folding potential .",
    "the measured cross section is not reproduced as well with that result as with the @xmath4folding one , although the discrepancies are not large . however , as noted previously  @xcite , the analyzing powers are very sensitive to the details of the density in the folding .",
    "we find this to be the case again , and at 65 mev , with all of the light nuclei .",
    "our results of scattering from @xmath144li are better , as now our prediction for the cross section obtained using the @xmath4folding potential are only marginally weaker than the data .",
    "the analyzing power is also well reproduced out to 80@xmath57 .    for @xmath145li ,",
    "the medium modification effects on the cross section are quite pronounced . in this case , it is essential to use the results from @xmath4folding",
    ". currently there are no data for the spin observables or for form factors from electron scattering for the exotic nuclei so that the proton cross section represents the best available test of putative structures . in this case , as for @xmath22li , the density profile was obtained directly from the shell model ground state . also , in absence of any electron scattering data , we used ws sp wave functions appropriate for electron scattering from @xmath145be .",
    "with such a specification , the result obtained from the @xmath4folding potential is remarkably good .",
    "the final results shown in fig .  [ li67911 ] are for @xmath22li as the target .",
    "this nucleus has a halo distribution associated with the very loosely bound valence neutron pair . to allow for this extension in the density we use ws sp wave functions with the binding energy for the @xmath146 and higher shell neutrons set to 500 kev @xcite .",
    "the ws functions assumed for the @xmath147 and @xmath148 orbits were those used for @xmath145li , consistent with the model for @xmath22li of a two - neutron halo outside a @xmath145li core . with that prescription ,",
    "our predictions adequately reproduce the data , although it slightly over - estimates the cross section at the small scattering angles .",
    "even so , using such a simple model to describe the halo nature of this nucleus produces results that give confidence to use proton scattering to study the matter distributions of other neutron and proton rich nuclei .",
    "we note in passing that for a target with non ",
    "zero spin it is essential to include all multipole contributions in the scattering , as is the case with all the lithium isotopes . in eq .",
    "( [ obdme ] ) , there are @xmath149 possible multipoles in the specification of the ground state .",
    "the contributions of non - zero multipoles are not large , but they are important .",

    "however , the effects of the medium modifications in the effective @xmath11 interaction are essential for any adequate description of the analyzing power . with the other nuclei ,",
    "the @xmath4folding model predictions are all very good .",
    "they are clearly better representations of the data , especially the analyzing powers , than are the results found with the @xmath5folding model . note that the range involves at least three orders of magnitude in the cross section .      while for light mass nuclei it is now possible to make shell model calculations using large and complete spaces , for @xmath24 and @xmath29 shell nuclei , such `` no ",

    ". therefore we have assumed ho functions with @xmath3  fm for all subsequent calculations of the proton scattering observables for nuclei with @xmath152 .",
    "the results for the elastic scattering of 65 mev protons from @xmath25ne , @xmath26 mg , @xmath27si and @xmath28s are presented in fig .",

    "the different deformation of @xmath157s might explain the difference we see in the quality of reproduction of the scattering data .",

    "this could cause the observed discrepancy with the data .",
    "also , the choice for the oscillator length might not be optimal .",
    "one could choose to set @xmath168 by a best fit to the cross  section and analyzing power data , as we did in our 200 mev analysis  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in every case , the results obtained in the @xmath4folding model are in much better agreement overall with the data , especially with the analyzing powers , with the level of agreement being actually quite good .",
    "the trends in magnitudes and shape of the data with mass remain and are enhanced with this set of nuclei .",
    "notably the first minimum of the cross section becomes more pronounced as does the first minimum in the analyzing power .      for nuclei with mass in excess of 70 ,",
    "shell model calculations , even in restricted spaces , generally are not feasible .",
    "the increase in the number of valence nucleons , and an increase in the number of sp states that may be occupied , cause the dimension of the model space to become prohibitively large .",

    "it is interesting to note that the region in which the analyzing power is underestimated by the @xmath4folding results is also that in which the cross section is underestimated .",

    "yet the comparison with the analyzing power data is remarkably good in tracking the shape and positions of the minima .",
    "it is clear once more that the effects of the nuclear medium in defining the effective @xmath10 optical potential are quite important .",
    "while the @xmath5-folding model results track the positions of the maxima and minima in the analyzing powers to some extent , they fail to reproduce the observed magnitudes .",

    "as the target mass increases , the magnitude of this minimum and of the following maximum are greatly suppressed .",
    "the absolute value of those minima and maxima approaches unity for the heaviest nuclei .",

    "there is a limited set of measurements @xcite of the spin rotations for the elastic scattering of 65 mev polarized protons from nuclei .",
    "these are displayed in fig .",
    "[ spinrfig ] . for the lightest four nuclei",
    "presented , the comparison between the @xmath4folding model results and data is quite good .",

    "the differences between the @xmath4 and @xmath5folding models are far more pronounced with the scattering from the heavier targets .",
    "while the @xmath4folding model results again give reasonable agreement with the data , the @xmath5folding model results fail to reproduce both shapes and magnitudes .",
    "indeed , that model predicts a maximum at @xmath179 in the spin rotation for the scattering from @xmath40zr and @xmath42sn ; the data indicate a minimum at that angle and such is predicted by the @xmath4folding model .",
    "while there are no data for the scattering from @xmath180sm , that difference between the models is also apparent . also by this mass ,",
    "the first minimum has almost disappeared . in the case of scattering from @xmath53pb ,",
    "the result obtained from the @xmath4folding model reflects the shape of the data , although it overestimates the observed magnitude above @xmath162 .",
    "a possible improvement to this result is to use a different set of sp wave functions , as is discussed below .      for the descriptions of the scattering for all nuclei up to and including @xmath25ne we have used sp wave functions which have been set by fits to electron scattering data . for heavier targets ,",
    "sp wave functions of ho form with @xmath169 fm have been used . in general",
    ", this choice has produced very good results in comparison with data , but it is instructive to investigate the sensitivity of our calculations to variations in that choice .",
    "for this example , we compare the results of two @xmath4folding calculations with scattering data from @xmath181ni and @xmath53pb in fig .",
    "[ hofig ] .",
    "therein , the solid line shows the results of our calculations made using the standard value .",
    "that is 1.97 fm and 2.43 fm for @xmath181ni and @xmath53pb , respectively .",
    "the dashed lines display the results obtained when the oscillator length was chosen to give a much better fit to the cross  section data .",
    "note that these choices are predicated on the simple structure models assumed for both nuclei .",
    "specific shell effects are expected to have some effect on the predictions of cross sections .",
    "the revised parameters are 1.87 fm and 2.35 fm for @xmath181ni and @xmath53pb , respectively .",
    "those lengths were used for all orbits .",
    "the improvement in the results with the new sp wave functions is very evident .",
    "there is much better agreement between the calculation and experiment for both nuclei , although the position of the minima in the cross section for the scattering from @xmath181ni are greater than observation . using these new sets of wave functions",
    ", one observes now much better agreement with the data for both spin observables . in the case of @xmath53pb ,",
    "the significant improvement in the spin rotation has been achieved with only a 3% decrease in the oscillator length .",
    "optical potentials for the elastic scattering of 65 mev protons from nuclei have been obtained by folding medium dependent effective @xmath11 interactions with a specification of the ground state for each nucleus , and also with sp wave functions of either ws or ho form .",
    "those optical potentials are complex and nonlocal and the scattering phase shifts and @xmath129matrices from which predictions of the measured quantities were obtained , result by solving the relevant nonlocal schrdinger equations .",
    "we have obtained good to excellent agreement with scattering data from targets ranging from @xmath0li to @xmath1u using the optical potentials so defined .",
    "the framework by which the results were obtained is entirely parameter - free ; no adjustment of any part of the input was necessary .",
    "thus the nonrelativistic mean - field theory for @xmath16 scattering based upon the infinite matter @xmath4 matrices is reliable for proton energies down to 65 mev .",
    "this gives encouragement for these techniques to be used in analyses of data from radioactive beam experiments .",
    "as the optical potentials are derived directly from the nucleon distributions , instead of averaged charge or matter distributions , this would provide detailed information on the structures of exotic nuclei , as was the case in the study of @xmath7he  @xcite and of @xmath8li  @xcite .",
