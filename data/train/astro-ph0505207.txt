    "the recent remarkable progress in cataloging the demographics of our universe is leading us inexorably towards the conclusion that it consists of about 70% dark energy , 25% dark matter and 5% everything else such as radiation and regular baryonic matter @xcite .",
    "the dominant dark energy component , which has a negative pressure , drives the acceleration of the universe @xcite ; while the pressureless dark matter gravitationally collapses into non - linear objects , forming the backbone of the large - scale structure of the luminous universe we see @xcite .    while the standard model of particle physics provides us a with a quite successful description of this 5% of baryonic matter in the universe , our knowledge of both dark energy and dark matter is tenuous at best .",
    "one of the more promising incarnations of dark energy involves non - canonical scalar fields , also known as k - fields @xcite .",
    "they were first introduced in the context of inflationary models @xcite , but it was soon realized that they offer great flexibility in designing various cosmological fluids with negative pressure , generally known as `` k - essence '' @xcite . examples of fluids that can be cast as k - fields include chaplygin and born - infeld gases @xcite , tachyon matter @xcite , phantom energy @xcite and ghost condensates @xcite .",
    "conventionally , we think of dark matter and dark energy as two separate entities .",
    "however there is a certain elegance in finding a unified model that describes both simultaneously .",
    "although chaplygin gases might embody such a unified description @xcite , phenomenologically successful models are hardly distinguishable from conventional @xmath0cdm , as far as the evolution of the background and its linear perturbations are concerned @xcite .",
    "recently , k - essence fluids have also found explicit application as possible ways to unify dark matter and dark energy in a model proposed by scherrer @xcite .",
    "the formation of structure in schrerrer s unified description has been studied by giannakis and hu @xcite .",
    "irrespective of the model under consideration , dark matter perturbations have to collapse to form approximately static objects which serve as gravitational potential wells where luminous matter such as stars and galaxies cluster .",
    "the standard paradigm to describe such large - scale structure is the halo model @xcite , which posits that cold dark matter agglomerates into roughly spherical objects called `` haloes '' . in this work , we extend the analysis of structure formation in k - essence models beyond the perturbative regime @xcite ; in particular we are interested in the structure of haloes made of k - essence fluids . specifically , we study static and spherically symmetric solutions of the einstein field equations sourced by a number of astrophysically interesting k - essence models .",
    "these include the usual barotropic gases considered in standard cosmology ( @xmath1 ) , the polytropic gases ( @xmath2 ) conventionally studied in astrophysics and the generalized chaplygin / born - infeld gas models ( @xmath3 ) proposed as forms of dark energy .",
    "the final case is especially intriguing , since cosmologically the fluid has negative pressure while in the static regime , as we shall see , it can form spherical objects with roughly flat rotation curves , implying that cosmological perturbations of dark energy may collapse to form dark matter haloes .",
    "before we proceed , we would like to comment on some philosophical questions about our approach .",
    "in general , dark matter is treated as an ensemble of low momentum particles , as opposed to as a classical field . in other words ,",
    "given a matter field lagrangian , we conventionally assume that dark matter is described by an incoherent excitation of the field quanta , rather than by a coherent one",
    ". however , in this paper , we take the second approach : we directly solve the einstein equations with k - field matter as a classical source .",
    "this is akin to some treatments of bosonic stars @xcite and bosonic dark matter haloes @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : mainmodel ] , we state our model and derive the weak field equations that spherically symmetric and static configurations of a k - field have to satisfy . in section",
    "[ sec : darkmatter ] , we solve these equations for two particular forms of a k - field lagrangian : a barotropic model ( section [ sec : barotropic ] ) and a polytropic / chaplygin gas model ( section [ sec : polytropelag ] ) . finally in section [ sec : conclusion ] , we present our conclusions . in addition",
    ", we have included several appendices which contain various derivations of relations and asides , that would have cluttered up the main text .",
    "however , we would like to highlight appendix [ sec : stability ] , where we provide a careful examination of the conditions one must impose upon the k - field lagrangian for it to have a valid initial value formulation , and appendix [ sec : nonsingular ] where we discuss a new class of de sitter solutions with spacelike gradients ( as opposed to the timelike de sitter solutions of k - inflation @xcite ) .",
    "in this section , we introduce the lagrangian of our model . we write down the field equation of motion and compute its stress - energy tensor , identifying the relevant physical variables along the way . for later use , we comment on the important differences between time - dependent and homogeneouscosmological\" field configurations and its static inhomogeneous counterparts . as we shall see ,",
    "while the stress tensor of a cosmological field does describe a perfect fluid , the stress tensor of a static field does not . following this discussion , we focus on the equations of motion of static and spherically symmetric field configurations by deriving the generalized hydrostatic equations and their weak field limit forms .",
    "we postpone the investigation of their solutions to the next section .",
    "our starting point is a non - canonical scalar field minimally coupled to gravity @xcite , @xmath4,\\ ] ] where the lagrangian @xmath5 is some arbitrary function of the squared gradient of the scalar field @xmath6 , @xmath7 following @xcite , we call such a scalar field a `` k - field ''",
    ". note that we are working in the @xmath8 metric signature convention .",
    "in general @xmath5 can be a function of both @xmath9 and @xmath6 , though here we assume that the lagrangian only depends on @xmath9 .",
    "this purely @xmath9-dependent lagrangian is the most general one compatible with a shift symmetry @xmath10 and second order equations of motion .",
    "the shift symmetry implies that there is a conserved current @xmath11 , whose conservation equation is simply the field equation of motion @xmath12 varying the action with respect to the metric @xmath13 yields the k - field energy momentum tensor @xmath14 the behavior of such a k - essence fluid depends on the scalar field gradient , which in turn depends on the symmetries of the spacetime the field is living in . in the often considered case of a k - field in a friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe , the symmetry of the robertson - walker metric demands that the scalar field be spatially homogeneous ( up to small perturbations ) , so its gradient is timelike , @xmath15 . in this case",
    ", the energy momentum tensor has perfect fluid form , @xmath16 where the energy density @xmath17 and the pressure @xmath18 are given by @xmath19 we have added a subscript @xmath20 for the `` cosmological '' density and pressure terms to distinguish them from their counterparts in the inhomogeneous case below . note that the four - velocity of the fluid is proportional to the scalar field gradient .",
    "in contrast , if the scalar field is static but spatially inhomogeneous , then its gradient is spacelike , @xmath21 , and the energy momentum is _ not _ of prefect fluid form .",
    "instead , it can be cast as ( note the last term ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a spacelike unit vector in the direction of the scalar gradient , @xmath24 .",
    "hence , an observer whose four - velocity is perpendicular to @xmath25 measures an energy density @xmath26 , a pressure in the direction perpendicular to @xmath25 equal to @xmath27 , and a pressure in the direction parallel to @xmath25 equal to @xmath28 , where the energy density and radial pressure are given by @xmath29 in other words , the pressure of the fluid is no longer isotropic @xcite .",
    "since dark matter haloes are roughly spherical and static , in this paper we specialize to spherically symmetric and static configurations of these k - fields . for later reference",
    ", we summarize the classical energy conditions for these field configurations in table [ tab : ec ] . for a definition of the classical energy conditions ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    ".energy conditions for a spacelike scalar field gradient.[tab : ec ] [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have investigated static and spherically symmetric solutions to the einstein field equations coupled to k - essence .",
    "our results shed light on the formation of non - linear structures in models where matter can be microscopically described by a non - canonical scalar .",
    "in contrast to homogeneous k - essence fluids , the energy momentum for these configurations does not have perfect fluid form . rather , it describes an anisotropic fluid with different pressures in the radial and tangential directions .",
    "therefore , the propagation speed of perturbations around these solutions differs from their cosmological counterpart .",
    "we have computed the sound speed of the former and formulated the necessary conditions for these solutions to be both classically and quantum - mechanically stable .    by making simple assumptions about the form of the k - essence equation of state , we have found solutions to several models of k - fields which exhibit dark matter halo - like properties , namely , flat rotation curves .",
    "the corresponding lagrangians are simple ( as in the barotropic case ) , and physically motivated ( as in the chaplygin gas / polytropic case ) . in both cases ,",
    "rotation curves are flat when the cosmological speed of sound of k - essence tends to zero .",
    "the latter include proposed unifications of dark matter and dark energy based on born - infeld and generalized chaplygin gases . among these ,",
    "the ones that yield flat rotation curves are precisely the ones consistent with the way linear structures forms in our universe @xcite .",
    "our solutions are valid only in the limit where the gravitational field of the halo is weak ; as one approaches the center of the halo , the weak field limit is generically violated as the density diverges . in other words",
    ", haloes made of this form of k - essence fluid also contain a central `` cusp '' , whose existence in real haloes is still under debate ( see e.g. @xcite . ) in any case , this is a generic problem in common cold dark matter models , and is conceivably resolved only when we add baryonic matter to our model .",
    "dark matter is a specter in search of an identity .",
    "although simple and appealing , the assumption that dark matter is made out of self - interacting particles requires involved numerical simulations to extract predictions about non - linear structure formation . in this paper",
    "we have explored an alternative  whether dark matter could be described by a non - canonical scalar field .",
    "as we have shown , this explanation has its own advantages .",
    "it makes simple , direct and straightforward predictions that can be immediately compared with observations .",
    "we would like to thank sean carroll , richard easther , stefan hollands , andrey kravtsov , wayne hu , mark trodden and bob wald for useful and insightful discussions .",

    "rotation curves of dark matter haloes are determined by measuring the doppler shift of light emitted by the orbiting objects , such as stars or gaseous ( `` hii '' ) regions . in order to compare our haloes with these observations ,",
    "we study how the light emitted by these objects at radius @xmath30 is red or blue - shifted . in this appendix ,",
    "our goal is to derive the rotation curves of massive particles in circular orbits around k - essence haloes ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "consider the motion of massive test particle , say a star , in a such a halo .",
    "its trajectory is then described by a curve @xmath31 parameterized by some affine parameter ; here we use its proper time @xmath32 .",
    "its four velocity is then simply @xmath33 . due to spherical symmetry",
    ", we can assume without loss of generality that the star s ecliptic is located in the @xmath34 plane . since the star is a massive particle ,",
    "its norm is @xmath35 , which becomes the constraint equation @xmath36 where a dot denotes a derivative with respect to proper time @xmath32 .",
    "since the metric does not explicitly depend on @xmath37 , the star s angular momentum @xmath38 is conserved , @xmath39 similarly , the metric does not explicitly depend on @xmath40 , and there is a conserved energy @xmath41 , @xmath42 substituting equations ( [ eq : e ] ) and ( [ eq : j ] ) into equation ( [ eq : normalization ] ) , we find a first integral for the motion of the star , @xmath43 where its effective potential is @xmath44 note that the potential explicitly depends on the energy .",
    "stationary orbits at radius @xmath45 exist if @xmath46 and @xmath47 vanish at that radius .",
    "the former condition yields @xmath48 whereas the latter gives us @xmath49 substituting equation ( [ eq : dopcond1 ] ) into equation ( [ eq : dopcond2 ] ) and using the 2nd tov equation ( [ eq : tov ] ) , we get the following equation @xmath50 which directly relates the angular momentum @xmath51 to the density profile of the halo .    with the angular momentum in hand , we turn to the task of finding the red or blue - shifting of light emitted by an object a such an orbit . consider a photon with momentum @xmath52 emitted by an orbiting star at radius @xmath45 , with its three - momentum assumed to be parallel to the star s three - velocity , @xmath53 since the star can move towards us or away from us , its four - velocity is given by @xmath54 meanwhile , the frequency of the emitted light @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 , and thus , by using equations ( [ eq : photonp ] ) and ( [ eq : obsu ] ) we find the zero component of the photon momentum is @xmath57    let us now turn to the computation of the frequency measured by a stationary observer far away from the halo , at @xmath58 .",
    "since she is stationary , her four - velocity is @xmath59 , so this observer measures the photon frequency to be @xmath60 . to determine @xmath61",
    ", we use the conservation of @xmath62 , which yields the red / blue - shifted frequency the observer would measure @xmath63 this frequency change includes that of the photon climbing out the gravitational potential ( i.e. its gravitational redshift ) ; to extract out the change in frequency due to the motion of the star , we simply compute the _ difference _ in the observed frequency as the star moves towards and away from us . using equation ( [ eq : dopcond1 ] )",
    "we find that to lowest order in small parameters this is @xmath64 which an observer interprets as being due to the peculiar velocity @xmath65 of the star , @xmath66 using equation ( [ eq : doppler ] ) to first order in @xmath67 and dropping the subscript @xmath68 , the rotation curve ( [ eq : velodefi ] ) becomes @xmath69 hence , once we have a solution for the energy density @xmath26 , and a relation between @xmath26 and the pressure @xmath28 , we can simply insert them into the right hand side of the above equation to obtain the rotation curve .",
    "in the previous sections we have studied several different static configurations of spherically symmetric non - canonical scalar fields . presumably , these are the end - result of the gravitational collapse of k - field matter . if so , they should be stable , since otherwise they would not be the end stage of a dynamical process .",
    "the stability of scalar field configurations depends on the microscopic properties of the scalar , i.e. on its lagrangian @xmath5 . in the context of cosmological solutions ( where the scalar field gradient is timelike )",
    ", classical stability requires that the speed of sound of the k- field be positive @xcite , @xmath70 note that this is a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition , since in principle we can still suffer from instabilities in the long wavelength regime .",
    "on the other hand , at the quantum level , stability requires the hamiltonian of field perturbations to be positive definite @xcite , which translates into @xmath71 if the last conditions are not satisfied , quantum fluctuations around the background cosmological solution have negative energy , and the vacuum can decay into positive energy gravitons and negative energy scalar field perturbations @xcite .",
    "note that quantum stability implies classical stability .    in the first subsection of this appendix",
    ", we analyze both classical and quantum stability of static , spherically symmetric configurations of a k - field .",
    "again , we find that quantum stability implies classical stability .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the stability conditions we find are intimately related to the existence of a well - posed initial value formulation , which we study in the second subsection of the appendix .",
    "as opposed to studies of stability , our approach here is quite general ; we do not make any assumption about the nature of the scalar field or the spacetime metric , and we do not rely on perturbation theory .",
    "consider a static spherically solution @xmath72 of the equation of motion ( [ eq : conservation ] ) .",
    "we would like to find out whether this solution is quantum - mechanically stable , i.e. whether it can decay through quantum processes . because any arbitrary spacetime is locally flat",
    ", we can assume that locally the metric is minkowski .",
    "moreover , because we are studying static solutions the gradient field is spacelike , locally we can also assume that the field gradient points in a given spatial direction , say , the @xmath73 direction , @xmath74 .",
    "let us perturb this local expression , @xmath75 and study the resulting lagrangian . using the definition ( [ eq : squaredgradient ] ) we find that the perturbed gradient is @xmath76 where we are using the minkowski metric .",
    "hence , expanding the lagrangian @xmath77 to quadratic order in @xmath78 we find @xmath79,\\ ] ] where a subscript @xmath80 denotes a partial derivative with respect to the coordinate variable @xmath81 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the scalar perturbations is positive definite only if the signs of the quadratic derivative terms in the lagrangian are positive for time derivatives and negative for spatial derivatives .",
    "thus , the condition for quantum mechanical stability is the same as in a cosmological background , equations ( [ eq : qmstability ] ) .",
    "although equation ( [ eq : pertlagrangian ] ) already suffices to determine the propagation speed of classical perturbations , it is more informative to consider an approach that maintains the symmetries of the background . hence , we expand a scalar field perturbation @xmath78 in spherical harmonics @xmath82 , @xmath83 and instead of expanding the lagrangian to quadratic order , we linearize the equation of motion . because of linearity , it is sufficient to consider one spherical mode at a time .",
    "moreover , by rotational symmetry , we can always assume @xmath84 .",
    "since matter is coupled to geometry through einsteins equations , linear perturbations in the scalar field should source metric perturbations .",
    "however , we do not expect the speed at which small perturbations propagate to depend on the strength of such coupling , newton s constant @xmath85 .",
    "so we simplify our problem by considering the limit @xmath86 .",
    "we mean the limit where every dimensionless quantity proportional to @xmath85 goes to zero .",
    "] in this limit matter perturbations do not source any metric perturbations , and one can simply study the propagation of the scalar field in a given , fixed , gravitational background . in this way , substituting @xmath87 into the equation of motion ( [ eq : conservation ] ) and keeping terms linear in @xmath78 we arrive at @xmath88 }      { e^\\beta[r^2 e^{\\alpha-\\beta } l_{,x}]}\\frac{d\\delta\\varphi_l}{e^\\beta dr }      + \\frac{l(l+1)}{r^2}\\delta\\varphi_l = 0\\ ] ] note that a static observer at radius @xmath30 measures proper time @xmath89 and proper distance @xmath90 . by inspection one",
    "can see then that the speed of propagation of radial perturbations is @xmath91 this is the _ inverse _ of squared the speed of sound in a cosmological setting ( where @xmath9 is timelike ) , equation ( [ eq : soundspeed ] ) .",
    "indeed , the definition of the squared speed of sound @xmath92 agrees with equation ( [ eq : cssq ] ) if the field is spacelike and @xmath28 and @xmath26 are given by equations ( [ eq : p ] ) , and it is the inverse of equation ( [ eq : cssq ] ) if the field is timelike and @xmath18 and @xmath17 are given by equation ( [ eq : rho ] ) .",
    "the linearized equation of motion also shows that for non - radial perurbations the speed of sound is @xmath93 , which , up to a sign , also agrees with the expectation @xmath92 .",
    "note that the sound speed is given by equation ( [ eq : cssq ] ) even if the lagrangian explicitly depends on @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath94 .",
    "in this part of the appendix we determine for what functions @xmath5 the scalar field equation possesses a well - posed initial value formulation .",
    "after all , we are mainly dealing with solutions of a classical field theory , and requiring the equations to have a well - posed initial value formulation amounts to self - consistency of our approach . as mentioned above",
    ", we will not make any assumption about the nature of the scalar field or the metric , and we will not rely on perturbation theory .",
    "we begin by rewriting the k - field equation of motion ( [ eq : conservation ] ) as @xmath95 where the `` induced '' metric is @xmath96 for simplicity we assume that @xmath5 only depends on @xmath9 , though our results also apply if the lagrangian depends on @xmath6 itself .",
    "it can be proven ( see theorem 10.1.3 .",
    "of @xcite ) that if the metric @xmath97 is lorentzian , the field equation admits a well - posed initial value - formulation ( at least locally ) , so all we have to show is that @xmath97 has a negative determinant .",
    "let @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 denote the matrices with elements @xmath97 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively .",
    "we then have @xmath103 where @xmath104 denotes the inverse of @xmath99 , and we have assumed @xmath105 .",
    "using the identity @xmath106 we find @xmath107,\\ ] ] and expanding the logarithm in a taylor series around the identity we obtain @xmath108 where we have used @xmath109 .",
    "finally , substituting equation ( [ eq : tln ] ) back into equation ( [ eq : identity ] ) we arrive at our desired result @xmath110 by assumption , the metric of spacetime is lorentzian , so that @xmath111",
    ". therefore , @xmath98 is lorentzian if and only if @xmath112    so far , we have found that the metric @xmath97 is lorentzian if condition ( [ eq : lorentzian ] ) is satisfied . because the assumptions of the theorem mentioned above apply , the k - field equation of motion is guaranteed to have a well - posed initial value formulation , at least locally .",
    "an ingredient of such a well - posed formulation is the  causal \" propagation of the scalar field .",
    "note however that the metric that enters equation ( [ eq : hyperbolic ] ) is not the space - time metric @xmath101 , but the derived metric @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , causality in the propagation of the k - field means that signals propagate inside the light - cone of the metric @xmath113 , and not @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "this observation sheds some light on a property of non - canonical fields that was noted early on @xcite . if the lagrangian @xmath5 is an arbitrary function of @xmath9 it is possible to obtain superluminal sound - speeds , @xmath115 . more generally , k - fields are natural implementations of bimetric theories , and they might offer a consistent theoretical framework to study and implement some of the ideas about causality as suggested in @xcite .    to further illustrate the causal structure tied to the propagation of a k - field ,",
    "let us consider the inverse of the matrix @xmath98 , whose components we denote by @xmath116 , @xmath117 note that the inverse of @xmath97 is not given by @xmath118 .",
    "the metric @xmath116 determines the causal structure of the solutions to equation ( [ eq : hyperbolic ] ) , and the theorem mentioned above guarantees that no signal can travel outside the light cone defined by @xmath116 .",
    "the question we are interested in is the following .",
    "suppose that a vector field @xmath119 is null with respect to @xmath113 ( @xmath120=0 ) , is @xmath121 timelike , spacelike or also null with respect to @xmath114 ? if @xmath119 is null with respect to @xmath116 , it follows from equations ( [ eq : lorentzian ] ) and ( [ eq : h ] ) that @xmath122 hence , there are two cases , as in fig .",
    "[ figcone ] :    * timelike gradient ( @xmath15 ) + in this case the vector @xmath119 is timelike for @xmath123 and spacelike for @xmath124 . for @xmath123",
    "the light cones of the metric @xmath113 are contained in the light cones of @xmath114 and for @xmath125 , the light cones of @xmath114 are contained in the light cones of @xmath113 , as one expects .",
    "this is consistent with @xmath126 being the squared sound speed , @xmath127 * spacelike gradient ( @xmath21 ) + in this case , the opposite happens . for @xmath124",
    "the light cones of the metric @xmath113 are contained in the light cones of @xmath114 and for @xmath123 , the light cones of @xmath114 are contained in the light cones of @xmath113 .",
    "this is also consistent with our observation that in a static , spherically symmetric spacetime radial perturbations propagate with squared speed , @xmath128",
    "our solutions in the weak field limit of the main text are all singular at the origin @xmath129 . therefore , our haloes appear to have density cusps at their centers .",
    "of course , near the origin the weak field conditions , equations ( [ eq : weakfield ] ) , are violated , so we do not expect our solutions to be valid in this regime .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether these singularities are an artifact of the weak field approximation , or whether they still persist in solutions of the full non - linear equations . here , by singular we mean that in the coordinate system defined by equation ( [ eq : metric ] ) quantities like the mass of the halo , the pressure , the energy density and the metric coefficients diverge .",
    "in this section , we show that the only one non - singular solution of the einstein equations coupled to a k - field whose lagrangian only depends on @xmath9 is de sitter spacetime .",
    "we note in passing that there are other non - singular static , spherically symmetric solutions to these equations , but they typically describe wormholes @xcite instead of haloes , and hence , can not be described in the coordinates we are using .",
    "let us begin with the full tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations ( [ eq : tov ] ) .",
    "we are going to look for regular solutions , so we can assume that @xmath130 , @xmath26 and @xmath28 admit taylor expansions around @xmath131 , @xmath132 where we have used that in order for the metric to be non - singular , @xmath133 . because both @xmath26 and @xmath28 depend on @xmath9 , the squared gradient can be similarly expanded @xmath134 now , we insert these expansions back into the tov equations ( [ eq : tov ] ) and do a term by term comparison . substituting equation ( [ eq : tmass ] ) into equation ( [ eq : dm ] ) and comparing coefficients we find @xmath135 also , inserting equation ( [ eq : tmass ] ) into equation ( [ eq : dalpha ] ) , one sees than @xmath136 is at most linear in @xmath30 .",
    "meanwhile , we substitute the expansions ( [ eq : tp ] ) and ( [ eq : ttau ] ) into the third tov equation ( [ eq : motion ] ) and compare coefficients , finding to @xmath137 that @xmath138 . therefore ,",
    "using equation ( [ eq : p ] ) , we find that either @xmath139 using the same tov equation , and armed with our knowledge that @xmath140 , we obtain the relation @xmath141 .",
    "now there are two possibilities ; if @xmath142 , then by equation ( [ eq : zero ] ) , @xmath143 , which implies @xmath144 . on the other hand , if @xmath145 we find that @xmath146 has to vanish , which in turn implies the vanishing of @xmath147 .",
    "we can use these results to set initial conditions at a sufficiently small non - vanishing @xmath148 .",
    "because @xmath138 , and because @xmath149 , we find that @xmath150 with this initial conditions we can integrate equation ( [ eq : motion ] ) from @xmath148 onwards immediately , to find that @xmath28 and @xmath26 are both constants .",
    "this is the only non - singular solution .",
    "what is the nature of the non - singular solution we have found ? since @xmath26 is constant and positive for all @xmath151 , the spacetime is simply de sitter . to verify this is indeed true ,",
    "we integrate equations ( [ eq : dm ] ) and ( [ eq : dalpha ] ) in the following .",
    "our result @xmath152 already solves ( [ eq : motion ] ) for all @xmath30 in one fell swoop",
    ". we can then integrate ( [ eq : dm ] ) to obtain @xmath153 which once substituted into equation ( [ eq : dalpha ] ) yields @xmath154 where we have assumed @xmath155 . putting everything back together",

    "it has been known for a while that de sitter solutions arise for timelike field gradients in k - field theories .",
    "these solutions exist if the lagrangian has an extremum at a positive value of @xmath9 , @xmath157 at @xmath158 .",
