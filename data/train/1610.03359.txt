    "in this paper we study properties of time dependent schrdinger - type linear partial differential equations defined on scales of hilbert spaces . our aim is twofold : ( i ) to put in a unified setting several results only known in particular cases concerning well - posedness and growth of norms for large time and ( ii ) to generalize and extend such results to new models .",
    "more precisely , given a scale of hilbert spaces @xmath12 , we denote by @xmath13 the scalar product of @xmath14 , and we consider cauchy problems of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a time - dependent , linear , symmetric ( w.r.t .",

    "+ our first result concerns a very general class of operators @xmath16 . roughly speaking , under the condition that the commutator @xmath19 $ ] is @xmath20-bounded for some @xmath21 , we will prove that the flow @xmath22 of exists globally in time in @xmath17 and its norm grows at most polynomially in time as @xmath23 , and more precisely we prove the upper bound @xmath24 for some constant @xmath25 independent of @xmath26 . here",
    "+ it is remarkable that such a bound , in the case @xmath28 , is optimal , since there exist operators @xmath16 , @xmath4 with @xmath29 $ ] bounded s.t .",

    "such an example was constructed by delort in @xcite , choosing @xmath31 where @xmath32 on @xmath11 is the harmonic oscillator and @xmath3 is an ad - hoc pseudodifferential operator of order 0 ( see remark [ rem : del ] for more details ) .",
    "however , with stronger assumptions on @xmath16 and @xmath4 , one might hope to improve the bound .",
    "indeed it is well known that in many interesting situations the norm of flow of grows much more slowly , in particular at most as @xmath5 when @xmath23 , for any @xmath7 .",

    "indeed its spectrum can be enclosed in clusters whose distance is increasing ( we will refer to such property as _ increasing spectral gap condition _ ) .",
    "note that , in the example of remark [ rem : del ] , the harmonic oscillator @xmath38 on @xmath11 does not fulfill the increasing spectral gap condition .",
    "such property motivates our second result . in order to improve the upper bound , we put ourselves in the situation where @xmath16 is of the form @xmath39 and we assume that @xmath4 has increasing spectral gaps . then provided that @xmath3 is smooth in time",

    "+ in the case where @xmath44 is analytic , we are able to further improve the bound , obtaining the logarithmic estimate @xmath45 where the constant @xmath46 can be explicitly calculated .",
    "this is the content of theorem [ thm : grest2 ] below .",
    "once again when @xmath3 is a bounded perturbation the exponent @xmath47 that we find is optimal ( see remark [ rem : bou ] below ) .",
    "finally we apply our abstract theorems to several different models , including one degree of freedom schrdinger operators , perturbations of the laplacian on compact manifolds , dirac equations , a discrete nls model and some classes of pseudodifferential operators .",
    "we recover many known results proven with different techniques , often improving such results ( allowing e.g. unbounded perturbations ) but also obtaining new results .",
    "more details and references will be given in section [ app ] .",
    "the problem of estimating the growth of higher norms for equation is very old , and goes back to the pioneering works initiated by howland @xcite and developed by joye @xcite , nenciu @xcite and barbaroux - joye @xcite .",
    "+ such authors , roughly speaking , under the increasing spectral gaps condition on @xmath4 and the assumption that the perturbation @xmath3 is smooth in time and _ bounded _ , use the method of adiabatic approximation to prove that for every @xmath40 we have @xmath48 our aim here is to extend the adiabatic approximation schema of joye and nenciu to a class of _ unbounded _",
    "perturbations @xmath3 and to control the growth of the @xmath17-norm @xmath49 .    as a final remark",
    ", we would like to mention some situations in which it is possible to prove better bounds , and in particular to prove that @xmath50 is uniformly bounded in time @xmath51 .",
    "such results can be obtained for instance provided that the perturbation @xmath52 fulfills some stronger assumptions , for example being quasi - periodic in time and small in size . indeed in these cases one might try to apply kam methods to conjugate @xmath16 to a diagonal operator with constant coefficients , which in turn implies that the @xmath17-norms are uniformly bounded in time @xmath51 . the problem of the existence of such a conjugation goes in the literature under the name of _ reducibility _ and had a tremendous development in the last 20 years .",
