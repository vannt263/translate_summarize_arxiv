    "cosmic radiation is a valuable source of information about various energetic astrophysical processes .",
    "however , the existence of very energetic cosmic rays also raises questions such as  : how are they accelerated and from where do they originate ? + a variety of possible accelerator mechanisms exists , ranging from shock waves produced by exploding stars ( supernovae ) or gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) to supermassive black holes with strong magnetic fields ( active galactic nuclei ) .",
    "the current understanding is that protons and electrons are the primary particles that are accelerated by electromagnetic fields at a cosmic accelerator site .",
    "+ in case of a supernova event , a shock is formed by the expanding matter envelope when it sweeps through the interstellar medium which surrounds the exploding star .",
    "in such an environment stochastic processes occur which can accelerate particles to very high energies .",
    "a detailed treatment @xcite shows that acceleration by shock waves automatically results in a power spectrum , which is in qualitative agreement with the observations up to the knee region of the cosmic ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "+ however , this leaves us with the question of which events can produce the cosmic rays above the knee region .",
    "candidates for the production of the most energetic cosmic rays are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and gamma ray bursts .",
    "the current perception is that the majority of these objects have a similar inner engine , in which infalling matter and the likely presence of a strong magnetic field gives rise to relativistic shock wave acceleration in two back to back jets .",
    "interactions of accelerated protons and electrons with the ambient photons at the acceleration site give rise to very energetic secondary particles , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jet ] .",
    "in particular the @xmath1 interactions yield a flux of very energetic neutrinos , as depicted in more detail in fig .  [",
    "fig : nuprod ] .            in case of a proton energy of @xmath2",
    "ev , i.e. the region of the knee of the cosmic ray spectrum , the photon energy threshold for @xmath3 production is about 10  ev , being the ultraviolet part of the spectrum .",
    "since there are many of these uv photons present , the depicted hadronic processes will take place at high rates , yielding substantial neutrino fluxes comparable to those of ultrahigh - energy photons .",
    "+ in the decay of the @xmath3 resonance into a nucleon and a @xmath4 meson , the meson obtains on average 20% of the primary proton energy .",
    "this yields an average neutrino energy of about 400  tev for a primary proton energy of @xmath2  ev .",
    "detailed model calculations @xcite predict an @xmath5 powerlaw spectrum for the produced neutrino flux . taking into account the fact that the atmospheric spectrum is softer @xcite and that the neutrino cross section increases with energy @xcite , we observe that optimal detection conditions are obtained for neutrino telescopes in an energy range of about 10 - 100  tev @xcite .    various attempts @xcite have been made to identify a high - energy neutrino flux in correlation with satellite observations of grbs .",
    "the performed searches for a statistical excess above the background comprise both photon - neutrino coincidence studies and investigations of so - called `` rolling time windows '' .",
    "+ however , the former will obviously fail in case there exists a significant time difference between the arrival times of the photon and neutrino fluxes , whereas the latter can only be succesful in case some grbs produce multiple neutrino detections within the corresponding time windows .",
    "so far , no positive identifications have been reported .    from the above it",
    "is seen that it would be preferable to use an analysis procedure that does not require the simultaneous arrival of photons and neutrinos and which also provides a high sensitivity in case of low signal rates .",
    "such a method , based on a time profile stacking technique , is presented here .",
    "in order to obtain a statistical significant result even in case of low signal rates , a cumulative procedure as outlined below has been devised .",
    "it is based on the generic grb engine described in the previous section , which implies that the arrival times of the photons and neutrinos are correlated but are not necessarily simultaneous .",
    "when a grb is observed by a satellite , the trigger time @xmath6 and burst location on the sky are recorded .",
    "afterwards , the data of a neutrino telescope are inspected for a time interval @xmath7 $ ] and all arrival times of upgoing muons are recorded relative to @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath8 is some predefined time margin , which is identical for all observed bursts .",
    "an upgoing muon is a long reconstructed track in a neutrino telescope pointing backwards to a location in the hemisphere opposite to the detector location .",
    "the usage of upgoing @xmath9 tracks allows reduction of the ( atmospheric ) background signals in our analysis procedure , as outlined lateron . + for a sample of different grb observations",
    ", the above will result in a set of identical time windows with upgoing @xmath9 arrival time recordings relative to the corresponding grb trigger time .",
    "stacking of all these time profiles will exhibit a uniform distribution for background events .",
    "however , in case the data contain upgoing @xmath9 signals correlated with the grbs , a clustering of data bins is expected .",
    "consequently , comparison of the stacked time profile contents with a uniform background allows the identification of correlated signals . due to the cumulative character of the procedure",
    ", large statistics can be obtained resulting in a good sensitivity even in case of low signal rates .",
    "+ any arrival time difference between a photon and neutrino signal poses no problem as long as this time difference is smaller than @xmath8 . as such",
    ", @xmath8 should be taken as large as possibly allowed by the background signals . however , it is obvious that a spread in this photon - neutrino arrival time difference will reduce the significance of the signal .    to address the feasibility of the procedure and to investigate the effects of the various parameters , a toy modelnick / grbmodel ] which mimics",
    "grb induced signals as well as ( atmospheric ) background has been devised .",
    "a description of this toy model and the results of the above analysis procedure performed on the simulated data for a km@xmath0-scale detector are presented hereafter .",
    "satellite observations of grbs have shown @xcite that the burst locations are homogeneously distributed over the sky . since our analysis procedure",
    "is based on the detection of upgoing @xmath9 tracks , our toy model only generates grb positions homogeneously distributed over the hemisphere opposite to the detector location .    for",
    "each generated burst location we define the satellite trigger time to be @xmath10 and create a time window @xmath11 $ ] around it .",
    "+ observations with the amanda neutrino telescope @xcite show that a km@xmath0-scale detector will observe on average 300 upgoing muons per 24 hours due to ( atmospheric ) background , homogeneously distributed over the hemisphere .",
    "therefore , each of the above time windows will be filled with a number of background upgoing muon signals taken from a poissonian distribution with an average number of @xmath12 .",
    "+ the arrival directions of these background upgoing muons are taken to be homogeneously distributed over the hemisphere , whereas their arrival times are taken to be uniformly distributed in the corresponding time window . to take the detector time resolution @xmath13 into account , a gaussian spread with a standard deviation @xmath13",
    "is introduced to the arrival times .",
    "finally the resulting arrival times are recorded as ( background ) entries in the various corresponding time windows .",
    "also the angular positions of the arrival directions are recorded , after introducing a gaussian spread corresponding to the angular resolution @xmath14 of the detector .",
    "recording of these angular positions will lateron allow reduction of the background by correlation with the actual grb locations .    by means of a uniform random number generator only a fraction @xmath15 of the generated burst locations",
    "is selected to yield a single upgoing @xmath9 signal . to mimic a time difference @xmath16 between the photon and neutrino burst arrival times",
    ", the upgoing @xmath9 signal arrival time of each signal burst is taken from a gaussian distribution with a mean value @xmath16 and a standard deviation @xmath17 . before these signal muon arrival times",
    "are added to the corresponding time windows , a gaussian spread corresponding to the detector time resolution @xmath13 is introduced .",
    "the arrival directions of these signal upgoing muons are recorded as the locations of the corresponding bursts , after introducing a gaussian spread corresponding to the detector angular resolution @xmath14 .",
    "introduction of realistic values for the various toy model parameters outlined above will allow to investigate the feasibility of detecting neutrino induced signals in a large scale neutrino telescope . in an actual experimental data analysis effort one obviously has to account for several additional ( systematic ) effects like detector stability , track reconstruction efficiency and so on",
    ". however , these are detector specific effects and fall beyond the scope of the present studies .",
    "the only large scale neutrino telescope currently in operation is icecube @xcite and as such we use the parameters of this detector @xcite as benchmark values for our present studies . + the expected data rates for the full km@xmath0 scale detector allow a time margin @xmath8 of 1 hour .",
    "this implies an average number of background signals of about 25 upgoing muons for each individual grb time window .",
    "the time resolution for the reconstructed muon tracks will be of the order of the time it takes for a muon to cross the detector volume . as such we take @xmath18s as a conservative estimate for the detector time resolution . experience with the analysis of the amanda data @xcite together with detector simulation studies @xcite show that a realistic estimate for the angular resolution is obtained by taking @xmath19 .",
    "+ the remaining parameters of our toy model are related to the characteristics of the various bursts . based on the processes sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : jet ] , a reasonable estimate for the possible photon - neutrino arrival time difference and its spread can be obtained from the actual burst duration .",
    "satellite observations @xcite exhibit a mean burst duration of about 30  seconds . as such we take @xmath20  s and @xmath21  s. as mentioned before , for evaluation of the currently presented procedure",
    "the value of @xmath16 is actually irrelevant as long as it is smaller than the time margin @xmath8 .",
    "+ this leaves us with only two free parameters : the fraction @xmath15 of grbs that actually induces an upgoing muon signal and the bin size to be used for the time profiles . in order to optimise the time bin clustering of the signals",
    ", the bin size should be taken to be of the order of the temporal signal spread @xmath17 .",
    "however , since the observed redshifts of grbs @xcite exhibit a median value of @xmath22 with a spread of 1.3 , cosmological time dilation effects have to be taken into account .",
    "it should be noted , however , that in case both the photon and neutrino production processes are taking place continuously throughout the jet existence , the cosmological time dilation is already included in the observed gamma burst duration and consequently also in the temporal signal spread @xmath17 .",
    "nevertheless , we always account for a possible additional cosmological time dilation and take for the time profile bin size a conservative value of @xmath23 , corresponding to 150  s. + it should be noted here that restricting the analysis to short duration bursts allows for smaller time bins and consequently more detailed time profile studies .",
    "+ the fraction @xmath15 we keep as a free parameter in order to determine the sensitivity of our analysis procedure for different sizes of the grb sample .    for a first investigation of the performance of the procedure we generated 100 grbs in one hemisphere .",
    "this corresponds to about 2 years of operation of the swift satellite @xcite , which currently is the main source of grb triggers .",
    "all parameters were set to the values mentioned above and for the fraction @xmath15 we used a value of 10% @xcite .",

    "reduction of the background without significant signal loss can be achieved by only investigating a certain angular region centered around the actual grb position . as detector angular resolution",

    "this question can be answered unambiguously if we are able to determine the @xmath42 value corresponding to the uniform background hypothesis based on our observed stacked time profile .",
    "the process of recording background signals is identical to performing an experiment with @xmath44 different possible outcomes @xmath45 at each trial .",

    "however , this will only provide meaningful results in case the conditions mentioned above are satisfied . in case",
    "a rather unlikely event happens to be observed within a small number of trials , a @xmath62 analysis may lead to completely wrong conclusions whereas the bayesian approach outlined above will provide the correct results @xcite . as such , the present studies will be based on the exact bayesian expression of eq .  .",
