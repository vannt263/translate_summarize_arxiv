    "point charge defects in semiconductors modify their properties , including their electronic structure , trapping and recombination rates for electrons and holes , and luminescence quenching @xcite . point defects in semiconductors",
    "have been studied extensively with the aim to use their properties for defect engineering .",
    "understanding the properties of point defects is important in studying the electrical and optical properties of semiconductors .    to date , little",
    "is known about the influence of point defects on the electronic structure and optical properties of self - assembled semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) grown epitaxially by the stranski - krastanow growth mode .",
    "these type of qds provide a quantum system which can be engineered to have a wide range of desired properties @xcite and provide a rather unique opportunity to investigate various effects known from atomic physics , in a solid state environment @xcite .",
    "however , their electronic structure and optical properties can be altered by the presence of defects inside the qds or in the surrounding barrier @xcite .",
    "the defects responsible for the electron ( hole ) trapping in iii - v semiconductor heterostructures are the positively ( negatively ) charged acceptor ( donor)-like defects such as vacancies , interstitial or substitutional defects @xcite .",
    "these defects in strained in(ga)as / gaas and strain - free gaas / al(ga)as qds may develop during the growth process @xcite . the negatively charged donor - like substitutional si defect in gaas qds",
    "are predicted to be stable @xcite .",
    "a point charge may also get trapped at a defect site during an optical or electrical measurement . charged defects inside a qd or in the surrounding region",
    "may change the depth and symmetry of the confining potential quite significantly affecting the electronic and optical properties of the qd .",
    "the influence of these defects on the optical properties have been shown only in few cases , namely for self - assembled ge / si @xcite , cdse / znse @xcite , and ingaas / algaas @xcite qds .",
    "for colloidal qds , on the other hand , the phenomena has been extensively investigated .",
    "the so - called blinking , is often attributed to the trapping of carriers into defect states on the surface or the surrounding matrix @xcite and represents a severe limitation for many potential applications@xcite . for self - assembled qds",
    ", we may speculate that charged defects may be responsible for the large spread of the excitonic fine structure splitting ( fss ) , polarization direction and polarization anisotropy in strained in(ga)as and strain - free gaas / al(ga)as qds @xcite .",
    "we investigate the effects of point charge defects on the electronic structure , the fss , emission energies and oscillator strengths of optical transitions in strained in@xmath0ga@xmath1as / gaas and strain - free gaas / al@xmath2ga@xmath3as qds . we use an atomistic empirical pseudopotential description and configuration interaction .",
    "the charged defects are modeled at the level of the hydrogenic effective mass description ( neglecting central cell effects ) .",
    "we find that the charged defects significantly modify the electronic structure and excitonic spectra in both strained and strain - free qds .",
    "however , the fss , polarization anisotropy and polarization direction in strained qds remain nearly unaffected , while in strain - free qds there are significant changes in these quantities .",
    "we consider impurity defects @xcite given as , @xmath4 , following hydrogenic effective mass theory and ignoring the central cell effects @xcite , where @xmath5 is the dielectric constant of the material composing the qd and @xmath6 is the position of the impurity .",
    "the positively ( @xmath7 ) and negatively ( @xmath8 ) charged point defects are placed at different locations shown schematically in fig.[fig : charged_geometry ] : 1 ) inside the qd near its center , 2 ) in the wetting layer ( wl ) underneath the base of the qd , 3 ) inside the qd near the interface with the barrier along the [ 1@xmath90 ] direction .    0 ] crystal direction . ]",
    "we used a lens - shaped qd with cylindrical base of 25.2 nm diameter and 3.5 nm height .",
    "we relax the atomic positions within the simulation cell to the minimum strain energy using the valence force field method @xcite .",
    "the single particle orbitals and energies of the qd are calculated by using the atomistic empirical pseudopotential approach @xcite , taking strain , band coupling , coupling between different parts of the brillouin zone and spin - orbit coupling into account , retaining the atomistically resolved structure .",
    "the coulomb and exchange integrals are calculated from the atomic wave functions as shown in ref . and",
    "the correlated excitonic states are calculated by the configuration interaction ( ci ) approach @xcite . for the ci calculations we use all possible determinants constructed from the twelve lowest energy electron and twelve lowest hole states ( spin included ) , thus accounting for correlations .",
    "the single particle energies of electron ( @xmath10 ) and hole ( @xmath11 ) states are given in figs .",
    "[ fig : sp_ingaas ] and [ fig : sp_gaas ] for the different defect configurations in in@xmath0ga@xmath1as / gaas and gaas / al@xmath2ga@xmath3as qds .",
    "we observe significant changes in the electronic structure of both strained in@xmath0ga@xmath1as and strain - free gaas qds in response to the charged defects .",
    "the energetic splitting between @xmath12 and @xmath13 states is significantly modified and the energies of electron and hole states blue - shift ( red - shift ) for negatively ( positively ) charged defects .",
    "this is due to the fact that the negative defects repel ( attract ) an electron ( hole ) and accordingly for the positive defects .",
    "the energetic splittings between the electron @xmath13 states ( @xmath14 ) and holes ( @xmath15 ) increase when the defects are placed along the [ 1@xmath90 ] crystallographic direction because it increases the inequivalence between the [ 110 ] and [ 1@xmath90 ] directions . in strain - free gaas qds",
    "there is a larger splitting of the @xmath13 hole states for the negative defects placed at positions 1 and 2 .",
    "this is due to the increase of light - hole character in response to the delocalization of the wave functions in z - direction as will be demonstrated next .",
    "the decomposition of the s hole state into light - hole ( lh ) and heavy - hole ( hh ) components is given in table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "the negative point defects @xmath8 at positions 1 and 2 lead to an increase of the lh - component , while the positive point defects @xmath7 at the same positions induce a reduction of the lh - component .",
    "this can be understood from the reduced and increased z - component of the hole wave functions .",
    "the hh is favored when the spread of the wave function in z - direction is small .",
    "the introduction of the positive point charge @xmath7 in the center of the dot leads to a delocalization in - plane and a reduction of the z - character of the wave functions , and hence of its lh - component .",
    "the negative point charge @xmath8 attracts the wave function that becomes more spherical with an increase of its z - character , and hence increase the lh - component        .decomposition of @xmath12 hole states into lh and hh components and coulomb integrals of hole - hole ( j@xmath17 ) , hole - electron ( j@xmath18 ) and electron - electron ( j@xmath19 ) interactions for the @xmath12 states . the sign ` + ' ( ` - ' ) indicate positively ( negatively ) charged defect .",
    "the position of defects ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) are defined in fig.[fig : charged_geometry ] . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]        the absorption spectra of neutral and charged excitons in ingaas and gaas qds with different point charge defect configurations are given in fig.[fig : exciton_ingaas ] and [ fig : exciton_gaas ] .",
    "the ss , pp and dd labels characterize the different orbital characters of the electron and hole states involved in the optical transition .",
    "the actual orbital s , p , d character of the hole wave functions for the gaas qd is given in table [ tab : table3 ] .",
    "it becomes clear that strong deviations from orbitally pure states exist in gaas .",
    "the states can hardly be classified as  s \" ,  p \" ,  d \" as they have a mostly mixed character .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that the gaas hole states have significant lh contributions due to the lack of strain in the structure ( the lh band is closer to the hh band than in strained inas dots ) .",
    "the hole states in gaas qds are even less  single - band \"- like than in strained ingaas qds .",
    "the consequence of this two - band character of the hole states in gaas is not obvious from the single - particle energies ( see fig.[fig : sp_gaas ] ) but very clear from the absorption spectra in fig.[fig : exciton_gaas ] .",
    "the single - band model for holes , that leads to the popular simplified optical selection rules  only ss , pp and dd transitions are allowed , leads to qualitatively wrong results . in gaas , the mixed transitions ",
    "sp \" ,  sd \" where the hole is in a nominally p and d state are bright .",
    "simply as a consequence , that these states have a significant s character , as given in table [ tab : table3 ] .",
    "the introduction of charged defects generally reduces the symmetry and introduces more lh - character in the hole states and more angular momentum mixing . as a consequence some transitions that were dark following the  single - band optical selection rules \" are now bright .",
    "this can be seen especially for the ingaas qd in fig.[fig : exciton_ingaas ] that have relatively pure angular momentum hole states . in the defect free case , mainly the ss , pp and",
    "dd transitions are bright .",
    "the introduction of negative point charges leads to the appearance of nominally forbidden ps transitions . in the case of the gaas",
    "qd the structure without defect has already a high level of angular momentum mixing ( table [ tab : table3 ] ) that the effect is quantitative which leads to the appearance of new peaks in the spectrum .",
    "we note that the oscillator strength for the ss transition is only slightly reduced in the case of the negative defects placed close to the center of the qds ( position 1 and 2 ) , for other cases it remains nearly unchanged .    in summary ,",
    "we investigate different point defect configurations in strained in@xmath0ga@xmath1as / gaas and strain - free gaas / al@xmath2ga@xmath3as qds . depending upon the relative position of the charged defects , we obtain significant modifications in the single particle electronic structure and excitonic spectra in both strained and strain - free qds .",
    "however , the fss , polarization anisotropy and polarization direction in strained qds remain nearly unaffected , while in strain - free qds these quantities change significantly .",
    "we furthermore highlight that the hole states in gaas qds deviate significantly from a single - band object .",
    "we find lh components of up to 20% and nominally ",
    "p \" states can have up to 30% orbital s - character .",
    "this leads to a complex absorption picture with many peaks in gaas qds , compared to the case of strained ingaas qds ."
