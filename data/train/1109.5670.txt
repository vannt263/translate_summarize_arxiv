    "these methods either ( i ) measure equivalent widths ( ew)s and infer elemental abundances from the curves - of - growth ( cog)s or ( ii ) synthesize spectra with varying elemental abundances to find the best match between the synthetic and observed spectra . the first method can not be successfully applied to the rave spectra because it requires isolated lines for precise ew measurements and , at the medium resolution of rave , most of the lines are instrumentally blended .",
    "also , the second method is computationally too expensive as it requires the synthesis of several spectra @xmath4400  wide , each having hundreds of lines .    the adopted method can be considered a hybrid approach , measuring the elemental abundances by fitting the spectrum with a model constructed with lines of known ews .",
    "the construction of the model is robust and fast , with the elemental abundances determined by a @xmath5 minimization routine .",
    "the drawback of this method is that the ews of the lines are computed by neglecting the opacity of the neighboring lines .",
    "this may overestimate the ews , leading in some cases to underestimated elemental abundances .",
    "we show below that this effect is small for most of the lines in the rave wavelength range .",
    "the chemical pipeline utilizes rave reduced spectra and their stellar parameters , such as effective temperature ( @xmath9 ) , gravity ( @xmath10 ) and metallicity ( [ m / h]@xmath11 ) , returned by the rave pipeline ( described in siebert et al . , @xcite)@xmath11indicates the uncalibrated metallicity as defined in ( zwitter et al . * ? ? ?",
    "the pipeline also uses an ew library based on the rave line list .",
    "the rave line list contains 604 known absorption lines identified in the rave wavelength range ( sec.[linelist_sec ] ) .",
    "the ew library contains the ews of absorption lines for every point on the @xmath12 , @xmath13  and [ m / h ]  grid ( sec .",

    "* ) reports that only 11 lines have laboratory oscillator strength measurements .",
    "the sun and arcturus s spectra were synthesized and the @xmath17 values for each line obtained using an automated procedure which varies the @xmath17s so as to match both spectra simultaneously .",
    "for the synthesis we adopted solar abundances as given by grevesse & sauval @xcite",
    ". they will be the zero point of the abundances of this work .",
    "the details of the procedure are outlined in appendix  [ app_linelist ] .",

    "the chemical pipeline performs a new normalization to remove such unwanted features , fitting the continuum and the strong and paschen lines .",

    "this methodology has a drawback : the computed cog of any absoption line neglects the opacity of the neighboring lines , leading to an overestimation of the ew of blended lines and so an underestimation of the elemental abundances .",

    "the larger dispersion at low abundances ( [ x / h]@xmath291.0 dex ) is very likely due to the fact that estimating precise stellar parameters on such spectra is challenging due to the few and weak visible absorption features ( excluding for the triplet , which is not measured ) .    the enhancement estimates ( [ x / fe ] , see figure  [ rave_ruchti_x_fe ] ) are accurate to within @xmath40.3 dex .",

    "for each element , the accuracy of the abundance estimate depends on the number of lines that are strong enough to be clearly detected ; to be measurable , the lines must be stronger than the noise . at the same time",

    "this means that for a fixed s / n , the accuracy of the elemental abundance is a function of the stellar parameters and of the abundance itself .",
    "the interplay of these factors makes the accuracy of the abundance results difficult to estimate . at high",
    "s / n , the accuracy varies from element to element , depending on the number and intensity of the lines measured .",
    "for instance , ti and ni lines are measured better in stars with @xmath12lower than @xmath45000k , whereas sulfur ( not present in this data release ) can be seen and measured only for temperatures higher than @xmath44800k .",
    "the rave line list has a few weak lines that can be measured only in stars with [ m / h ]  @xmath210.5 dex .",
    "noise affects the ews of the lines and so the model spectrum . as the pipeline varies the abundances of the individual elements , the larger the number the absoption lines of an element , the lower the abundance error due to the fitting , because the effects of noise are averaged over the lines .",
    "thus , the abundance accuracy of elements with fewer lines is especially affected by noise . when the noise is particularly strong with respect to the intensity of the lines , i.e. , low s / n , the minimization routine fits the noise and the resulting elemental abundance diverges . in such cases",
    "the pipeline rejects the measurement and renders a null value -9.99 .",
    "the situation get worse in the low s / n regime , because the pipeline measures even fewer lines , i.e. , only those strong enough to be detected despite the noise .",
    "this decreases the number of measurable elements and increases the uncertainties . in section  [ test_synt ]",
    "we tested the pipeline down to s / n=20 to see if at such a low s / n the measurements are still trustworthy .",
    "the results suggest we can use such data , but with care .",
    "noise generates selection effects : spectra having low [ m / h ]  or high @xmath12do not have lines strong enough to overcome the noise and they go through the pipeline unmeasured .",
    "a limited number of lines can also generate systematic errors because the abundance of an element depends on just a few lines ( sometimes even only one ) and thus becomes especially vulnerable to uncertainties in the oscillator strengths .",
    "nevertheless , the tests performed with synthetic spectra at s / n=20 show that abundances of elements with strong lines like fe , al and si can still be measured . at such low s",
    "/ n , errors as large as @xmath40.2 - 0.3 dex are expected , but they do not show large systematic biases and the residuals are on average close to zero .    we conclude that elemental abundances may be trusted down to s / n=40 for seven elements ( details will follow in section  [ sec_catalogue ] ) , whereas between s / n=20 and 40 we can trust the abundance of [ fe / h ] and ( to be on the safe side ) the abundance [ @xmath66/h ] , when computed from the average of mg and si . abundances for other elements for the low s / n stars should be considered indicative , and used only for exploratory purposes until new comparison stars enable a proper validation of our results in this s / n regime .",
    "our elemental abundance measurements are indirect measurements in the sense that they are inferred from the comparison between the intensity of lines seen in real spectra and their intensity predicted by stellar atmosphere models",
    ". since the models are different for different stellar parameters , a question arises regarding whether all the models yield elemental abundances which refer to the same zero point , i.e. , the origin of the internal elemental abundance scale .",
    "the same question concerns whether this zero point refers to the same zero point of the real spectra , i.e. , between the internal and external scales .",
    "the latter question has a prompt answer : we do not know the external scale , because real stellar atmospheres have never been directly probed and all elemental abundance measurements refer to models .",
    "therefore , we can only check the consistency of the internal scale .",
    "this can be performed by comparing the measured elemental abundances of a sample of synthetic spectra at different stellar parameters , as done in figure  [ abd_comparison ] .    in this plot , at s / n=100 , the residuals between measured and expected elemental abundances are on average zero for any gravity and metallicity ; the points align along a straight line with slope roughly equal to one .",
    "this means that the measured differences in elemental abundance at any metallicity regime are the same ( constant offset ) , i.e. , they refer to the same zero point .",
    "however , the offset from element to element may vary , showing that the offsets are due to the measurement process and not due to the metallicity of the atmosphere models .    on the other hand , there is a clear correlation between residuals and @xmath12 : the higher the @xmath12  , the higher the measured elemental abundance .",
    "this systematic may be due to continuum correction :",
    "cooler stars have spectra that are crowded with absorption lines and so the continuum appears lower than it is .",
    "additionally , the varying behaviour of the elements in figure  [ abd_comparison ] can be explained by considering that their lines lie in different regions of the spectrum , i.e. , on the wings of a line or in a region relatively free of lines .",
    "this can translate into systematic , wavelength - localized shifts of the estimated continuum as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "although this systematic effect appear tractable and correctable , we did not apply any correction to the data because such a systematic is not visible on tests with real spectra .",
    "when the rave elemental abundances are compared with the expected elemental abundances of standard stars as function of @xmath12 no clear trend is visible ( figure  [ resid_abd_teff ] ) , except that rave elemental abundances have a slight systematic bias to lower values .",
    "a reasonable explanation is that the elemental abundance measurements given by sg05 and r10 suffer from the same systematic error , due to uncertainties in estimating the correct continuum level in regions crowded with absorption lines or affected by the wings of strong , broad lines .",
    "we conclude that the rave chemical pipeline can determine chemical elemental abundances with a systematic error that may be as large as @xmath87 dex as a function of @xmath12 . since this systematic looks quite linear with @xmath12  ( see figure  [ abd_err_comp ] and figure  [ resid_abd_teff ] ) , to reduce this error to @xmath880.05 dex we suggest analysing separately samples of stars with @xmath12@xmath215500k ( mostly dwarfs ) from samples with @xmath12  @xmath295500k ( mostly giants ) .",

    "some previously unidentified lines have been added in order to match features that are clearly visible in spectra of the sun and arcturus .",

    "@xcite we also adopted the enhancement factor e@xmath105 for the unsld approximation because it is commonly accepted that the line broadening due to van der waals interaction obtained from unsld s approximation is too weak and needs to be corrected .",
    "for the cn molecule we used the dissociation energy d=7.75ev , as suggested by sauval & grevesse @xcite .",
    "we performed the inverse spectral analysis by synthesizing solar and arcturus s spectra with moog ( a standard lte line analysis and synthesis code by ( sneden , * ? ? ? * ) ) and changing the @xmath17s values until a good match with both observed spectra is reached .",
    "we show here that matching these two spectra ( or more ) allows us to improve the @xmath17s of blended lines , which otherwise would be impossible to disentangle .",

    "when all the atmosphere model parameters are fixed , the curve of growth equation can be written as a function , @xmath50 , of @xmath17 and elemental abundance @xmath111 @xmath112    this allows us to disentangle two or more blended lines : let @xmath113 be the ew of a blended feature of the star @xmath114 composed of @xmath115 lines of @xmath116 different elements ( @xmath117 ) and having @xmath118 unknown ews .",
    "then we can write the system of equations @xmath119 where @xmath120 represents the abundance of the element the line belongs to .    since the physical conditions and elemental abundance @xmath111 of each stars are in general different , the values @xmath113 are different as well .",
    "the equation system [ eq_syst ] is solvable when the ( @xmath121 ) number of equations is greater than the unknown @xmath122 .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of the solution is assured even for lines where the weak - line approximation does not hold , because the first derivative of the curve of growth is always positive .",
    "this means that it is always possible to determine the @xmath17s of a blended feature and the elemental abundances by using a large enough number of spectra of different stars . in our case",
    "we have used two spectra : the sun and arcturus .",
    "the following routine is valid when the stellar parameters and elemental abundances of both stars are known .",
    "we also consider later the case where elemental abundances are not known . to synthesize the solar spectrum we assumed an effective temperature @xmath12=5777k , gravity @xmath13=4.44 , microturbulence v@xmath123=1.0 km / s and metallicity [ m / h]=0.00 . for arcturus",

    "2 .   select the first line of the list 3 .",
    "integrate the absorbed flux of the observed and synthesized spectra over an interval spanning 0.4  around the center of the line ( roughly 1 fwhm , which takes into account most of the absorbed flux ) and calculate the normalized ew residual ( newr ) , defined as follows @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the flux of the synthetic and the observed spectrum , respectively .",
    "for the sun and arcturus we write ( @xmath127 ) and ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "4 .   if @xmath129 then add @xmath130 to the @xmath17 , else if @xmath131 then add @xmath132 to the @xmath17 ( i.e. match the sun first ) . go to step 7 .",
    "if @xmath133 and @xmath134 then add @xmath132 to the @xmath17 , else if @xmath133 and @xmath135 then add @xmath130 to the @xmath17 ( e.g. if the sun matches then try to match arcturus ) .",

    "if @xmath136 and @xmath137 are both @xmath138 then a valid @xmath17 has been reached .",
    "select the next line from the line list and return to step 3 .",
    "the routine is iterated until no more improvement is seen .",
    "for about ten lines a good match could not be reached .",
    "several reasons may be behind this : bad continuum correction , lines located over the lines where the fit is unaccurate , misidentified lines or unrecognized blends . for these lines , we did a visual check and manually corrected the @xmath17 values .",
    "the correction is good enough to derive @xmath15-values that yield abundance errors per measured line smaller than 0.2 dex in average for both the sun and arcturus .",
    "since the abundance of arcturus is not known for all elements , we decided to assume an initial abundance for all the elements ( [ x / h]=[m / h ] ) and find the right abundances with the following procedure :    1 .",
    "synthesize the sun s and arcturus s spectra .",
    "2 .   correct the @xmath17 values by running the above correction routine until no more improvements are possible .",
    "3 .   check the distribution of the newrs for each element separately : if a positive / negative offset is present , decrease / increase its abundance .",
    "4 .   synthesize the solar and arcturus s spectra with the new @xmath16s and abundances .",
    "return to step 2 .",
    "this algorithm is repeated until there are no more improvements .",
    "the results of this procedure are the new @xmath17s and arcturus s chemical abundances ( listed in table  [ abundances ] ) .      in the rave / gaia wavelength range there are features that belong to atomic multiplets",
    ". an interesting characteristic of these multiplets is that they share the same excitation potential @xmath104 and have small differences in wavelength . in this case , obtaining a proper @xmath139 for the individual lines is problematic .",
    "we work around this problem in the following way : consider the two lines at @xmath140 and @xmath141 that share the same excitation potential @xmath142 .",
    "the two lines have unknown equivalent widths @xmath143 and @xmath144 but the sum @xmath145 is measured and well known . we can write the curve of growth as @xmath146    where @xmath147 is the aluminum abundance and the other quantities are as in eq .  [ for_grow ] . substituting eq .",
    "[ eq_cog ] in eq .",
    "[ ew_sum ] and adopting the approximation @xmath148 we obtain @xmath149 using the logarithmic form , this equation then becomes @xmath150 which suggests that an appropriate functional form for a  dummy \" variable @xmath151 would be @xmath152 .",
    "even if this does not allow us to disentangle the two @xmath16s , we can consider the multiplet as if it were one single line and correct the @xmath153 ; it will be a `` dummy '' value but it results in giving the correct abundance of al .",
    "this correction has also been applied to three multiplets , centered at wavelengths 8717.814 , 8736.020 and 8773.896@xmath154 .      in order to test the accuracy of this procedure ,",

    "figure  [ ew_sun ] presents the difference in abundances obtained by using the kurucz @xmath15-values ( open points ) and the corrected ones ( solid points ) .",
    "our correction reduced the standard deviations of the abundance residuals from @xmath57=0.63 dex to @xmath57=0.15 dex and their averages from + 0.16 to -0.05 .",
