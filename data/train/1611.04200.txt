    "negatively charged nitrogen - vacancy centers in diamond@xcite , phosphorous atom impurities in silicon@xcite and other schemes based on point defects embedded in semiconductors have been widely studied as alternatives to develop quantum bits@xcite .",

    "the nuclear dipole - dipole interaction is believed to be the dominant mechanism behind the diffusion - induced electron - spin decoherence@xcite . to protect the dynamics of the nuclear spins of point defects from the decoherence induced by the environment ,",
    "semiconductors mainly composed of spin - zero isotopes as silicon and carbon are preferred over iii - v semiconductors@xcite .",
    "even though the two stable isotopes of ga , @xmath0ga and @xmath1ga , have nuclear spin @xmath2 , in dilute nitride gaasn , point interstitial defects give rise to paramagnetic centers that have very peculiar and useful properties .",
    "one of them is the spin dependent recombination ( sdr ) @xcite . in ga(in)nas alloys ,",
    "ga@xmath3 paramagnetic centers with only one bound electron can selectively capture another conduction band ( cb ) electron with the opposite spin orientation @xcite . due to this mechanism ,",
    "paramagnetic centers act as a spin filter that blocks the recombination of cb electrons with the same spin and efficiently capture electrons whose spin is in the opposite direction . in the centers ,",
    "the bound and captured electron form a singlet state that is destroyed as either one of the electrons recombines to the valence band ( vb ) .",
    "it is important to note that while the lifetime of a cb electron with the opposite spin to the paramagnetic electrons is a few pico - seconds , the lifetime of a spin polarized cb electron when the majority of bound electrons are polarized parallel to it may extend to nanoseconds . as a consequence cb electrons spin polarization can reach over 80% under circularly polarized incident light .",
    "additionally the photoluminescence ( pl ) intensities can be as high as 800% under circularly polarized optical excitation compared to a linearly polarized one @xcite .",
    "the increase in cb electron population allows even for the detection of electron spin polarization by electrical means due to a giant photoconductivity effect under circulalrly polarized light@xcite .    whereas in diamond and silicon the optical excitation acts directly on the point defects , in gaasn",
    "the bound electron is dynamically spin polarized due to the recombination of spin polarized cb electrons on the paramagnetic centers .",
    "although this mechanism is radically different , ga@xmath4 centers themselves are very similar to nitrogen vacancies and silicon phosphorous atoms .",
    "recent experiments on gaasn subject to a weak magnetic field in faraday configuration @xcite have shown consistently an enhancement in the spin - filtering mechanism in comparison to the zero magnetic field case .",
    "the general agreement among different models@xcite is that the hyperfine interaction ( hfi ) between the bound electron and the nucleus in the centers is the key element behind this phenomenon . at low magnetic fields ,",
    "the spin - filtering effect is reduced due to spin state mixing induced by the hfi . for higher values of the magnetic field such that the zeeman energy exceeds the hfi , the pure bound electron spin states and ,",
    "consequently , the spin filtering effect are recovered . even though the role of the hfi is well established , some aspects of these phenomena lacks full understanding . some observations point to the existence of an overhauser - like effective magnetic field@xcite",
    "whose origin is yet unclear .",
    "it manifests as a shift in the band to band pl intensity or the degree of cb electron spin polarization as functions of the magnetic field .",
    "both features shift to the positive and negative regions of the magnetic field for right and left circularly polarized light respectively .",
    "another aspect that needs further study is the nuclear interaction between ga@xmath4 centers and adjacent ga atoms that would lead to nuclear spin relaxation ( nsr ) . the overhauser - like magnetic field has been correctly reproduced in ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] , however , nuclear spins in this model are assumed to relax very rapidly and the origin of the relaxation mechanism is unclear . on the other hand , the model presented in ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] considers two phenomenological and arbitrary nsr times for traps with one and two bound electrons . despite the improvements in this work , the model considers ga centers with @xmath5 nuclear spins instead of @xmath2 in order to simplify the kinetic equations .    in this paper",

    "we propose a model based on the master equation for the density matrix that describes the main interactions between cb electrons , vb holes and paramagnetic traps .",
    "it addresses the problems on spin relaxation mechanisms and overhauser - like magnetic field .",
    "in fact , our results show that the overhauser - like magnetic field strongly depends on the nsr times and the mechanisms behind them",
    ".    the model developed here is based on the preexisting two charge model ( tcm ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to the sdr processes , it contains the mechanisms that give rise so nsr and hfi .",
    "nsr is addressed through the wangsness , bloch , and redfield relaxation theory @xcite .",
    "two interactions are explored as possible candidates to produce the nsr : dipolar interaction between neighbouring nuclei@xcite and quadrupolar @xcite interaction with charge fluctuations in the environment .    to further explore the role of hfi in ga centers ,",
    "we have studied the time resolved electronic and nuclear spin polarizations under pulsed excitation . using these results we outline a method based on a pump - probe photoluminescence scheme to trace the coherent evolution of coupled electrons and nuclear spins as they flip - flop due to the hfi .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the system mainly consists of four elements : vb holes , cb electrons , unpaired traps ( ut ) and paired traps ( pt ) . whereas vb holes spin relaxes with a characteristic times below @xmath7@xcite , cb electronic spin relaxes on a typical time in the range @xmath8@xcite .",
    "therefore , for the sake of simplicity , we consider vb holes to be unpolarized and electrons may occupy spin - up or spin - down states .",
    "gallium paramagnetic traps or uts can be understood as a @xmath2 nuclear spin coupled to a @xmath5 bound electron spin via hfi . on the other hand ,",
    "when a pt is formed if a cb electron is captured by an ut , the bound and captured electrons form a singlet state that can not interact with the nuclear spin .",
    "thus the quantum state basis that describes this system must have : ( i ) one state for holes in the vb , ( ii ) two states for the spin up and spin down cb electrons , ( iii ) eight states that account for the nucleus - bound electron system in the uts and ( iv ) four states for the nuclear spin in the pts . the complete quantum state basis is therefore given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the vb hole state and , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the spin - up and spin - down cb electron states respectively .",
    "the following eight states @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 are the bound - electron and nuclear spin states projected along the @xmath17 axis corresponding to the ut .",
    "finally , the pts are described by the nuclear - spin states @xmath18 , @xmath15 , @xmath19 .",
    "the dynamics of the four parts of the system and their interactions can be described through the master equation @xmath20+\\mathcal{d}\\left(\\hat\\rho\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the density matrix , @xmath22 is the hamiltonian and @xmath23 is the dissipator .",
    "the hamiltonian contains the internal interactions among the four components of the system .",
    "we are interested in the combined effect of an external magnetic field and the hfi in ga centers , therefore the hamiltonian must contain zeeman and hfi terms .",
    "the interactions among the different parts of the system and the surroundings are accounted for by the dissipator .",
    "these are mostly interactions with the electromagnetic field , occurring during recombination or excitation processes , or interactions with the nuclear spin environment .",
    "the main processes introduced in our model are schematized in fig",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath24 the first and second terms in the hamiltonian correspond to the zeeman interaction for cb and bound electrons in ga centers respectively .",
    "in these terms @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the external magnetic field , @xmath28 is the bohr magneton and , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the cb and bound electrons gyromagnetic factors .",
    "the hfi term , the third one on the right - hand side of eq .",

    "the hyperfine parameter is given by @xmath31 .",
    "the spin operator for cb electrons that appears in the first zeeman term of the hamiltonian is @xmath32 . in uts ,",
    "the bound electron spin and nuclear spin operators entering the hfi term are @xmath33 , and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "as the singlet state formed in the pts interacts neither with the external magnetic field nor with their nuclear spin @xmath35 , it does not appear in the hamiltonian .",
    "the relaxation mechanisms of cb electrons and nuclei in the ga centers are described by the dissipator @xmath36 .",
    "also , the photoexcitation and recombination of electrons will be accounted for by @xmath37 .",
    "our approach to formulating a suitable dissipator consists in expanding the relevant operators as linear combination of the elements of an operator vector space . in principle",
    "this set should be formed in the basis ( 1 ) by linearly independent @xmath38 hermitian matrices .",
    "however , the density matrix structure is considerably simplified by assuming that the four components of the system ( cb , ut , pt , vb ) are interconnected only by the dissipator . as the four parts of the system are exclusively coupled by the recombination or excitation processes , this is a reasonable assumption .",
    "thus , the density matrix operator can be presented in the block diagonal form : @xmath39 where the four blocks @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) are the partial density matrices of vb holes , cb electrons , uts and pts respectively . given",

    "thereby , under @xmath190 and @xmath191 excitation the minimum is located at @xmath192 and @xmath193 respectively .",
    "the experimental data shows that @xmath194 grows with the excitation power @xmath166 until it apparently saturates at approximately @xmath195 .",
    "the non - selective dissipator yields vanishing @xmath194 as no shift is observed for @xmath180 in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] .",
    "this dissipator is too symmetric to be able to produce an overhauser - like magnetic field and hence must be ruled out as the leading nsr mechanism .",
    "in contrast , the dipolar and quadrupolar mechanisms yield non - vanishing @xmath194 as it can be seen in figs .",
    "[ figure3 ] and [ figure4 ] .",
    "these two plots show @xmath181 for the dipolar and quadrupolar dissipators for various excitation powers .",
    "even though the shifts produced by both mechanisms qualitatively agree with the experimental observations , only the dipolar one is able to accurately fit the experimental measurements as we discuss below .",
    "in addition to the overhauser - like magnetic field , another feature that strongly depends on the nsr mechanism is the depth of the inverted lorentzian - like @xmath181 curves given by @xmath196 . to discern which of the two mechanisms is the dominant one , we compare our theoretical calculations with the experimental observations of @xmath194 and @xmath197 @xcite .",
    "the power dependence of @xmath194 and @xmath197 is determined by finding the minima @xmath198 and maxima @xmath199 of @xmath181 for different excitation powers .    in fig .",

    "the @xmath194 and @xmath197 isolines at other excitation power coincide at similar @xmath150 and @xmath151 values .",
    "collecting the intersecting points of all the experimental results we find that the nsr times must fall within the ranges @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "plots of @xmath194 and @xmath197 as functions of the excitation power are shown in figs .",
    "[ figure6 ] ( a ) and [ figure6](b ) respectively .",
    "the best quantitative agreement with the experimental data is accomplished by using the nsr times @xmath207 and @xmath188 consistent with the ranges above .",
    "whereas the calculated @xmath197 presents a very good agreement with the experimental data , the theoretical values of @xmath194 above @xmath208 show a significant deviation with respect to the experimental observations .",
    "the experimental results suggest that after increasing with the excitation power , @xmath194 saturates at approximately @xmath195 . however , the computed @xmath194 as a function of the excitation vanishes for high powers after reaching its maximum at @xmath195 ( see fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] ) .    the quadrupolar mechanism , however , yields systematically non - intersecting isolines regardless of the excitation power value used to calculate them . in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] we present the @xmath209 and @xmath201 isolines that clearly do not intersect .",
    "this behaviour is observed for all the excitation powers reported experimentally and therefore we must also rule out the quadrupolar mechanism .      having identified the nsr mechanism and the corresponding relaxation times we are in a position to consider time resolved simulations .",
    "our aim here is to develop a method to observe the coherent oscillations of bound electrons and nuclei in ga centers .",
    "to do so we propose a pump probe scheme that we describe below .    in pe regime ,",

    "the pump pulse originates at @xmath160 and the probe is delayed @xmath214 .",
    "figure [ figure8 ] is an outline of the proposed method .",
    "the pump pulse is left circularly polarized and therefore most of the electrons are spin polarized in the @xmath215 direction .",
    "likewise , the probe pulses are left circularly polarized fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] also shows a plot of the bound electron and nuclear spin polarizations as a function of time after being excited by the pump pulse .",
    "the pump and probe pulses widths are exaggerated to make them visible in the given time scale . in this plot",
    "it is possible to observe the electron - nucleus flip - flops as oscillations of @xmath216 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath217 ( thick lines ) that are phase shifted by @xmath218 . as indicated in this diagram , the second pulse at time delays @xmath219 and",
    "@xmath220 probes two extreme situations . in the first one cb electron and bound electrons",
    "are mostly spin polarized in opposite directions .",
    "the center is therefore more likely to capture a cb electron whose spin is oriented in the opposite direction to the majority therefore rising the population of electrons in the cb .",
    "in contrast , in the second situation centers are more likely to capture electrons whose direction is parallel to the majority diminishing the electron population in the cb .",
    "a good estimate of the electron and hole population in either situation is the time resolved sdr ratio given by @xmath221 where the pl intensity under circularly polarized light @xmath222 is proportional to the cb and vb density populations @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
    "similarly @xmath225 where @xmath226 and @xmath227 are the density populations of cb electrons and holes under linearly polarized light . if cb electrons are captured spin dependently by the ga centers then @xmath228 and @xmath229 and therefore @xmath230 . in accordance with the above considerations , @xmath231 where @xmath232",
    "thus , it is possible to trace the oscillations of bound electrons and nuclei by successively measuring the time resolved @xmath233 for different probe pulse delays .    by determining the maxima of the time resolved @xmath233 for different probe pulse delays",

    "this plots demonstrate that it is possible to trace the coherent oscillations of the spin polarization of bound electrons interacting with the nuclei by means of the time resolved @xmath235 ratio .",
    "we have analyzed the spin dynamics of electrons and nuclei in gaasn by developing a model based on the master equation approach .",
    "the main mechanisms behind the spin dependent recombination are considered as well as the hyperfine interaction in ga paramagnetic traps .",
    "we have demonstrated that the nsr in centers plays an essential role in reproducing the two most significant signatures of the hfi in ga centers .",
    "first , the amplification of the spin filtering effect under a faraday configuration magnetic field is visible only if some nsr mechanism is present .",
    "second , the features of the overhauser - like magnetic field not only depend on the hfi but also strongly rely on the nature of the nsr mechanism .",
    "we have tested the dipolar interaction between neighbouring ga atoms and the quadrupolar interaction of ga centers with random charge distribution background .",
    "we have proven that the dipolar is the only mechanism compatible with the experimental observations . indeed , a scenario where large charge distribution variations are present in the vicinity of the ga nuclei is difficult to imagine .",
    "although most of the experimental results are correctly reproduced by our model some of the aspects regarding the behaviour of the overhauser - like magnetic field remain elusive .",
    "one of these is the discrepancy between the saturation values in the high power regime .",
    "this is important since it would allow to pinpoint the exact origin of the nsr mechanism .    to further explore the effects of the hfi and the nsr we have tested the model in the pe regime . in particular ,",
    "we have proposed a pump - probe scheme that allows to trace the coherent oscillations of the bound electron spin interacting with its nucleus through the hfi .",
    "even though in principle this model is conceived for ga centers , it can be easily adapted for other type of centers where dipolar or quadrupolar interactions play an important role as the leading mechanisms of nsr .",
