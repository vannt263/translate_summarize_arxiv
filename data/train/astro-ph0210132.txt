    "in spite of a increasing amount of data , the origin of cosmic rays in particular at the highest energy ( @xmath11ev ) is still unknown .",
    "it is very difficult to produce such ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( hereafter uhecrs ) in astrophysical shocks , which are thought to be responsible for the galactic cosmic rays .",
    "the gyroradii of uhecrs with energies of 10@xmath12ev are larger than our galaxy , and this suggests an extragalactic origin for any astrophysical scenario .",
    "using a hillas - plot @xcite , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , dead quasars and colliding galaxies are considered as probable candidates .",
    "these conventional acceleration models are called bottom - up scenarios . on the other hand , this situation has in recent years triggered a number of exotic production models based on new physics beyond the standard model of the particle physics ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , which are called top - down scenarios . in such scenarios ,",
    "uhecrs owe their origin to decay of some supermassive particles , which could be produced from topological defects ( tds ) , or be certain metastable supermassive relic particles ( msrps ) produced in the early universe .    in bottom - up scenarios in which protons are accelerated in the potential uhecrs sources , like grbs and agns , the large distances to the earth lead to another problem , called the gzk effect @xcite .",
    "uhe protons with energy above 8@xmath13 ev interact with photons of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and lose their energy rapidly due to the production of pions over distances of tens of mpc @xcite .",
    "this should results in a cut - off of the cosmic ray spectrum at energy around 8@xmath13 ev .",
    "the situation for nuclei is considered to be worse due to the photo - disintegration mechanism @xcite .",
    "observationally , there seems to be a disagreement between the agasa which revealed the extension of the cosmic ray energy spectrum above @xmath10 ev @xcite and the high resolution fly s eye ( hires ; * ? ? ? * ) which recently reported the cosmic ray flux with the gzk cut - off @xcite .",
    "since uhecrs above @xmath10 ev observed by the agasa must originate within the gzk sphere , whose radius is typically about 50 mpc , the arrival directions are expected to point toward their sources within a few degrees , which is typical deflection angle of uhecrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , no plausible source counterparts have been found within the gzk sphere .",
    "there is also a problem concerning the arrival directions of uhecrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "their distribution seems to be isotropic on a large scale with a statistically significant small scale clustering @xcite .",
    "the current agasa data set of 57 events above 4 @xmath13 ev contains four doublets and one triplet within a separation angle of 2.5@xmath14 .",
    "chance probability to observe such clusters under an isotropic distribution is about 1 @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "potential models of uhecr origin are constrained by their ability to reproduce the observed energy spectrum and the isotropic arrival distribution of uhecrs with the small scale clustering .",
    "a number of studies has been devoted to the problem of the energy spectrum .",
    "yoshida and teshima ( 1993 ) show the gzk cutoff in consideration of evolution of the universe .",
    "blanton et al.(2001 ) show that the observed number of events above @xmath10 ev is 2 @xmath16 higher than the expected one , assuming a hard @xmath17 injection spectrum and small local overdensity ( a factor of two ) .",
    "berezinsky et al.(2002 ) analyze three source models , grb , agn and local enhancement of uhecr sources .",
    "they conclude the agasa events above @xmath10 ev , if confirmed , must be of different origin . although these authors show that it is difficult to reproduce the observed extension of the energy spectrum by the bottom - up scenarios , they do not take into account of the effects of the extragalactic magnetic field ( egmf ) on the energy spectrum . furthermore , since they do not consider angular source distribution as well as the egmf , the problems concerning the arrival distribution of uhecrs can not be discussed .",
    "although arrival distributions from a single source are calculated in the presence of magnetic field in some papers @xcite , it appears to be difficult to explain the observational isotropy by a single source . with consideration of both the magnetic field and the source distribution , the energy spectrum and the distribution of the arrival directions",
    "are calculated in sigl et al.(1999 ) and lemoine et al.(1999 ) .",
    "however the source distribution seems to be too simple , a two dimensional sheet @xcite or a pancake - like profile @xcite , which represent the local super cluster ( lsc ) .",
    "smialkowski et al.(2002 ) calculate arrival distribution of uhecrs using the iras pscz catalog of ir galaxies as a realistic source model .",
    "however , they restrict their attention to galaxies with far infrared luminosity @xmath18 triggered by collision and merging processes , which are possible sites of uhecr acceleration . it is also suspected that this galaxy sample do not contain some nearby galaxies in the lsc .",
    "since nearby sources within the gzk sphere are responsible for uhecrs above @xmath10 ev , galaxy sample with better completeness on nearby galaxies should be used .",
    "given these situations , we examined in our previous paper @xcite whether the current observation can be explained by a bottom - up scenario in which source distribution of uhecrs is proportional to that of galaxies .",
    "we used the optical redshift survey ( ors ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a realistic source model .",
    "completeness on nearby galaxies of this sample would be better than that of the iras pscz . by using the ors sample",
    ", we can accurately quantify the contribution of nearby sources to the energy spectrum above @xmath10 ev .",
    "we also took effects of the egmf on the energy spectrum and the arrival distribution of uhecrs into account .    however , there are problems in our previous study .",
    "first , we did not correct absence of galaxies in the zone of avoidance ( @xmath1 ) when using the ors sample , so that we could not present accurate discussion of statistics on the arrival directions of uhecrs .",
    "second , we considered propagation of uhecrs only over 40 mpc , focusing on uhecrs with energies above @xmath19 ev . in this case ,",
    "contribution of distant sources ( outside 40 mpc ) to the cosmic ray flux below @xmath19 ev can not be taken into account . finally , we injected uhecrs from all the galaxies including dwarf ones .",
    "luminous galaxies are generally larger than dwarf ones , and thus they are expected to be able to accelerate particles to higher energy .",
    "thus , we should investigate dependence of the results on the limiting magnitude of galaxies .",
    "this paper is an extended study of our earlier work .",
    "we calculate the energy spectrum and the arrival distribution of uhecrs using the ors galaxy sample .",
    "we correct the sample taking the selection effect and absence of galaxies in the zone of avoidance ( @xmath1 ) into account .",
    "this allow us to accurately discuss statistics on the arrival directions of uhecrs .",
    "we also extend the propagation distance of uhecrs , from 40 mpc to 1 gpc .",
    "as s result , we can calculate the cosmic ray flux below @xmath19 ev , properly including contribution from distant sources .",
    "furthermore , we investigate dependence of the results on the limiting magnitude of galaxies .",
    "we compare the results of the energy spectra with the current observations , agasa and hires . in order to explore the possibility of reproducing the extension of energy spectrum beyond @xmath10 ev",
    ", we adopt several strength of the egmf ( 1,10 and 100 ng ) .",
    "we also investigate dependence of the arrival distribution of uhecrs on the limiting magnitude of galaxies and the source number , and estimate the most favorable ones from comparison with the agasa data using the harmonic analysis and the two point correlation function as statistical methods .",
    "we show that the three observable quantities including the gzk cutoff of the energy spectrum can be reproduced in the case that the number fraction @xmath5 of the ors galaxies more luminous than @xmath4 mag is selected as uhecr sources .",
    "implications of the results for the uhecr source candidate are discussed in detail .    in section  [ model ]",
    ", we show our method of calculation .",
    "results are shown in section  [ result ] and their implications are discussed in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "this subsection provides the method of monte carlo simulations for propagating protons in intergalactic space . at first",
    ", we assume that the composition of uhecrs is proton , and inject an @xmath20 spectrum within the range of ( @xmath21 - @xmath22)ev .",
    "10000 protons are injected in each of 26 energy bins , that is , 10 bins per decade of energy for the cases of @xmath23 = 40mpc and ( @xmath24 , @xmath23 ) = ( 1,10ng , 10mpc ) , where @xmath24 and @xmath23 are strength and correlation length of the extra galactic magnetic field ( explained below ) . for another cases , we inject 5000 protons in each of the bins .",
    "particles below @xmath25 ev lose their energies mainly by pair creations and above it by photopion production @xcite in collisions with photons of the cmb .",
    "the pair production can be treated as a continuous loss process considering its small inelasticity ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we adopt the analytical fit functions given by chododowski et al .",
    "( 1992 ) to calculate the energy loss rate for the pair production on isotropic photons .",
    "according to them , the energy loss rate of a relativistic nucleus for the pair production on isotropic photons is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the lorenz factor of the particle , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 is the momentum of the particle in units of @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are the photon distribution in the momentum space , the fine - structure constant , the classical electron radius , the charge of the particle , and the rest mass of the particle , respectively . for the energy range @xmath37 ev , @xmath38 can be well represented as @xmath39 @xmath40    since protons lose a large fraction of their energy in the photopion production , its treatment is very important .",
    "we use the interaction length and the energy distribution of final protons as a function of initial proton energy which is calculated by simulating the photopion production with the event generator sophia @xcite .",
    "we checked that arrival spectrum at earth for mono - energetic injection of energy @xmath41 ev is consistent with that of stanev et al.(2000 ) ( fig .",
    "2 ) , which is also calculated with the event generator sophia , for the case of ( @xmath24 , @xmath23 ) = ( 1ng , 1mpc ) which is the closest parameter set to the one of stanev et al.(2000 ) .    the egmf are little known theoretically and observationally",
    ". the upper limit for its strength and correlation length @xmath42 , as measured by faraday rotation of radio signals from distant quasars @xcite , is often used @xcite .",
    "we adopt in this study not only this widely accepted value , 1ng , but also relatively strong magnetic field ( 10ng , 100ng ) , which is better for explaining the extension of the energy spectrum and the observed isotropic arrival distribution . in this case ,",
    "deflection angles of uhecrs become so large that the no counterparts problem can be simply solved .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field is represented as the gaussian random field with zero mean and a power - law spectrum .",
    "thus , @xmath43 can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath23 is the correlation length of the egmf and @xmath45 characterizes the numerical cut - off scale .",
    "we use @xmath46 corresponding to the kolmogorov spectrum . according to our previous study @xcite ,",
    "the correlation length is chosen to be 1 mpc , 10 mpc , and 40 mpc .",
    "1 mpc is roughly equal to mean separation of galaxies and widely used as the typical value of the correlation length . as we show later",
    ", the small scale clustering observed by the agasa is difficult to be reproduced for @xmath47 mpc ( see figure  [ fig13 ] and  [ fig17 ] ) .",
    "we do not have to consider the correlation length larger than 40 mpc .",
    "physically one expect @xmath48 , but we set @xmath49 in order to save the cpu time .    the universe is covered with cubes of side @xmath23 . for each of the cubes , fourier components of the egmf are dialed on a cubic cell in wave number space , whose side is @xmath50 , with random phases according to the kolmogorov spectrum , and then fourier transformed onto the corresponding cubic cell in real space .",
    "we create the egmf of 20 @xmath51 20 @xmath51 20 cubes of side @xmath23 , and outside it , adopt the periodic boundary condition in order to reduce storage data for magnetic field components .",
    "similar methods for the turbulent magnetic fields have been adopted @xcite .    in this study , we assume that the source distribution of uhecrs is proportional to that of the galaxies .",
    "we use the realistic data from the ors @xcite galaxy catalog , which is nearly full sky survey , and contains two subcatalogs , one complete to a b magnitude of 14.5 ( ors - m ) and the other complete to a b major axis diameter of @xmath52 ( ors - d ) .",
    "another nearly full sky catalog which is often used in this kind of study is the iras pscz survey @xcite .",
    "however , it is suspected that some galaxies in the lsc are excluded .",
    "since local overdensity of uhecr sources makes the gzk cutoff less sharp or eliminate it , we use the ors as a source model rather than the iras .    in any statistical acceleration mechanism",
    ", particles must be kept confined within the acceleration site .",
    "luminous galaxies are generally larger than dwarf ones , and thus they are expected to be able to accelerate particles to higher energy .",
    "furthermore , it is less well known that luminous galaxies in the lsc distribute outward than faint galaxies , contrary to general clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we inject uhecrs from galaxies with different limiting magnitudes , and explore the source model which reproduces the current observation . as an example",
    ", this selection of luminous galaxies corresponds to restricting the sources of uhecrs to host galaxies of agns .",
    "it is still unknown how much an ultimate uhecr source contribute to the observed cosmic ray flux .",
    "we thus consider the two cases in which all galaxies are the same , and they inject cosmic rays proportional to their absolute luminosity .",
    "this allow us to investigate effects of the uncertainty of the cosmic ray luminosity on the results .    since we consider the galaxies with different absolute magnitudes , we use the magnitude - limited subcatalog , i.e. , ors - m , which is also composed of two subsamples , eso - m ( 2437 galaxies ) and ugc - m ( 3279 galaxies ) .",
    "we further restrict ourselves to galaxies within 8000 km s@xmath53 and with @xmath54log@xmath55log@xmath56 , which corresponds to the apparent magnitude limit of @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the dimensionless hubble constant @xmath59 km s@xmath53 mpc@xmath60 and @xmath61 is the recession velocity . in the following , we abbreviate @xmath54log@xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "we exclude very faint nearby galaxies with @xmath64 . galaxies in the zone of avoidance ( @xmath1 )",
    "are not observed .",
    "our final ors sample contains 5178 galaxies with 2346 galaxies in the eso - m and 2832 galaxies in the ugc - m .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the sky distribution of our ors galaxies in the equatorial coordinate .",
    "the strip between the eso and ugc region @xmath65 is covered by the esgc , which is a part of the diameter - limited subcatalog , ors - d .",
    "the absolute magnitudes are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] as a function of the recession velocity . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume that there are no departures from uniform hubble expansion for simplicity , and use @xmath66 in calculating distance between galaxies in the sample and our galaxy from recession velocity .    in order to calculate the energy spectrum and the distribution of arrival directions of uhecrs realistically , there are two key elements of the galaxy sample to be corrected .",
    "first , galaxies in a given magnitude - limited sample are biased tracers of matter distribution because of the flux limit . for each galaxy in the sample",
    ", we compensate galaxies which is not included in the sample using the selection function given in santiago et al.(1996 ) .",
    "the positions of compensated galaxies are determined according to gaussian distribution whose mean is the position of the original galaxy and rms is such that @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the distance from our galaxy and @xmath69 , @xmath70 are number density of galaxies which is also calculated using the selection function , value of the selection function at distance @xmath68 from us respectively .",
    "for the reason of the selection effect , the ors is only sampling the universe out to 8000 km s@xmath53 ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we assume that contributions from sources outside it is completely isotropic , and calculate its amount from the number of galaxies inside it .",
    "second , our ors sample does not include galaxies in the zone of avoidance ( @xmath1 ) and the esgc region @xmath71 . in the same way",
    ", we assume that the source distribution in this region is homogeneous , and calculate its number density from the number of galaxies in the observed region , which is corrected for the selection effect . in figure  [ fig3 ]",
    ", we show the sky distribution of the ors galaxies corrected in the manner explained above .",
    "finally , we now explain how the angular probability distribution of uhecrs are calculated . at first , protons with a flat energy spectrum",
    "are injected isotropically at a given point in each of the 26 energy bins , and then propagated in the egmf over @xmath72 gpc for @xmath73 gyr . weighted with a factor corresponding to a @xmath20 power law spectrum , this provides distribution of energy , deflection angle , and time delay of uhecrs as a function of the distance from the initial point . with this distribution",
    ", we can calculate the flux and the arrival directions of uhecrs injected at a single uhecr source .",
    "then , summing contributions from all the sources , we obtain the angular probability distributions of uhecrs . in this paper , we use the distribution of energies and deflection angles integrated over the time delay , assuming that the cosmic ray flux at the earth is stationary . in figure",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show number of protons with energies of @xmath74 ev integrated over deflection angle , time delay as a function of propagation distance . it is noted that this number is proportional to the cosmic ray flux in this energy range from sources in concentric shells with an infinitely small width , assuming that a source distribution is homogeneous .      in this subsection , we explain the two statistical quantities , the harmonics analysis for large scale anisotropy @xcite and the two point correlation function for small scale anisotropy .",
    "the harmonic analysis to the right ascension distribution of events is the conventional method to search for global anisotropy of cosmic ray arrival distribution . for a ground - based detector like the agasa",
    ", the almost uniform observation in right ascension is expected .",
    "the @xmath75-th harmonic amplitude @xmath68 is determined by fitting the distribution to a sine wave with period @xmath76 . for a sample of @xmath69 measurements of phase , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 ( 0 @xmath81 ) , it is expressed as @xmath82 where , @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "we calculate the first and second amplitude from a set of events generated according to predicted probability density distribution of arrival directions of uhecrs .",
    "if events with total number @xmath69 are uniformly distributed in right ascension , the chance probability of observing the amplitude @xmath85 is given by , @xmath86 where @xmath87 the agasa 57 events is consistent with isotropic source distribution within 90 @xmath15 confidence level as shown later .",
    "accordingly , we adopt the amplitude such that @xmath88 as observational constraint , rather than the most probable amplitude calculated from the observed 57 events .",
    "the two point correlation function @xmath89 contains information on the small scale anisotropy .",
    "we start from a set of generated events or the actual agasa data . for each event , we divide the sphere into concentric bins of angular size @xmath90 , and count the number of events falling into each bin .",
    "we then divide it by the solid angle of the corresponding bin , that is , @xmath91 , \\label{eqn100}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 denotes the separation angle of the two events .",
    "@xmath90 is taken to be @xmath93 in this analysis .",
    "the agasa data shows strong correlation at small angle @xmath94 with 5 @xmath16 significance of deviation from an isotropic distribution as shown later .    in order to quantify the statistical significance of deviations between models and data we introduce @xmath95 , which is defined by , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the value of the two point correlation function obtained by the agasa observation at angle @xmath98 , and @xmath99 is statistical error of the @xmath100 due to the finite number of simulated events , which is set to be the observed one . in this study , we take @xmath101 to be 10 deg for properly quantifying deviations of models from the sudden increase of correlation at the small angle scale observed by the agasa .    we compare the model predictions with the existing agasa data throughout the paper .",
    "therefore , we set the number of simulated events to be that of the agasa data above @xmath102 ev ( 57 ) , and restrict the arrival directions of uhecrs in the range of @xmath103 when calculating these statistical quantities .",
    "there are also the present working or development of large - aperture new detectors , such as the hires @xcite and south and north auger @xcite .",
    "if they report the arrival directions of observed events , we can make comparisons between the model predictions and their data using the same statistical methods .",
    "in this subsection , we present the results of the numerical simulations for the angular images of uhecrs in a variety of conditions concerning strength and correlation length of the egmf and the limiting magnitudes of galaxies .",
    "we show the angular images for two energy range @xmath104 ev and above @xmath10 ev , about at which the gzk cutoff of the energy spectrum is predicted . for comparison , we also show the agasa events with the angular images .",
    "it is noted that the current agasa data set contains 49 events with energies of @xmath104 ev and 8 events above @xmath10 ev .",
    "the calculated angular images of uhecrs originating the galaxies more luminous than @xmath105 ( upper ) , @xmath106 ( middle ) , @xmath107 ( bottom ) for number ( left ) and luminosity ( right ) weighted sources in the case of @xmath108 are shown in figure  [ fig5 ] for energy range @xmath104 ev . the agasa 49 events in this energy range are also shown as circles of radius proportional to their energies .",
    "spatial structure of the lsc is reflected by prominent high intensity region running north and south at @xmath109 for @xmath105 and @xmath106 . since the luminous galaxies which distribute outward than the faint ones make a substantial contribution in the case of luminosity weighted sources",
    ", the region of high intensity becomes to be less obvious in the case of @xmath105 .",
    "in other cases , there is no significant difference simply due to small variance of absolute magnitudes of the individual galaxy .",
    "we can see that the angular image becomes to be isotropic and show good correlation with agasa events as restricting sources to more luminous galaxies .",
    "such correlation of the agasa events with angular image of uhecrs is also pointed out in the case of galaxies with huge infrared luminosity @xcite .    even for @xmath110 , there are high intensity regions around @xmath111 which do not correlate with the agasa events . however ,",
    "if we select sources , which contribute to the currently observed cosmic ray flux , from our ors sample , these high intensity regions can be eliminated .",
    "an example in the case of @xmath112 is shown in figure  [ fig21 ] as we explain later .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the predicted angular image of uhecrs for @xmath113(1,1 ) ( upper ) , ( 1,10 ) ( middle ) , ( 10,1 ) ( bottom ) and @xmath105 ( left ) , @xmath107 ( right ) with energies of @xmath104 ev .",
    "the angular image is distorted for @xmath113(1,10 ) , ( 10,1 ) , and dependence on the correlation length is relatively weak because the deflection angle of uhecrs is proportional to @xmath114 . as we will show later , this distortion of the angular image is crucial for the small scale clustering .    in figure",
    "[ fig7 ] , we show the angular image for @xmath108 ( upper ) , @xmath115 ( middle ) , @xmath116 ( bottom ) and @xmath105 ( left ) , @xmath107 ( right ) with the energy range @xmath117 ev .",

    "there is no correlation for @xmath105 between the agasa events and the angular image of uhecrs . for @xmath110 ,",
    "arrival distribution is relatively isotropic , but still has no correlation with the agasa events . as we conclude later , the agasa events above @xmath10 ev might be of different origin , if they are confirmed .",
    "we present in this subsection the results of the numerical simulations for the energy spectra of uhecrs .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows the energy spectrum in the case of @xmath119 ( upper ) , @xmath120 ( middle ) , @xmath121 ( bottom ) ng and @xmath110 for number weighted sources .",
    "they are normalized arbitrary , but with the same factors for all the values of the correlation length .",
    "the substantial deflection in the egmf results in a significant increase of the path length , then leading to a time delay exceeding the age of the universe or a decrease of energy below @xmath122 ev due to pair production for protons injected at sufficiently large distance , as easily seen in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "thus , the stronger egmf make the gzk cutoff around @xmath10 ev less sharp or eliminate it in figure  [ fig8 ] .",
    "when the correlation length of the egmf is small , protons can not be deflected effectively and thus its path length and equivalently energy loss is smaller than that for longer correlation length .",
    "this can also be seen in figure  [ fig4 ] and figure  [ fig8 ] . especially , effects of changing the correlation length are large at @xmath123 ev for @xmath124 ng and at @xmath125 ev for @xmath126 ng , where gyroradii of uhecrs are about @xmath72 mpc and thus deflection is strong enough for the diffusion approximation to become applicable in the case of @xmath127 and @xmath128 mpc .    in order to determine normalization of the energy spectrum and quantify statistical significance of mean deviation between the fitted energy spectrum and the observed one , we introduce @xmath129 in the similar way as the two point correlation function explained in the previous section .",
    "this is defined by @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the energy spectrum observed by the agasa at @xmath132 , and @xmath99 is @xmath133 error at this energy bin .",
    "the origin of cosmic rays with energies below @xmath21 ev is also one of the major open questions in astro - particle physics .",
    "berezinsky et al.(2002 ) showed that predicted uhecrs flux from grbs fall short of the observed flux below @xmath21 ev assuming an injection spectrum @xmath20 , which is advocated in vietri ( 1995 ) and waxman ( 1995 ) , and also used in this study .",
    "however , there are another possible extra - galactic and galactic uhecr production sites , such as agns and young neutron stars @xcite . maximum energy of cosmic ray achieved by them may be lower than @xmath21 ev . in this case",
    ", these galactic and/or extra - galactic components may substantially contribute to the cosmic ray flux below @xmath21 ev . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume that these components bridge the gap between the observed flux and the predicted one of berezinsky et al.(2002 ) , and restrict ourselves to the energy spectrum only above @xmath21 ev .",

    "we also show the significance values @xmath129 in this figure .    the predicted energy spectrum for @xmath134 provide good fit to the agasa data , including the extension above @xmath10 ev .",

    ", the energy spectrum can be well fitted with the agasa data below @xmath136 ev , but the gzk cutoff is predicted above @xmath136 ev due to the energy loss by photopion production in contrast to the agasa data .",

    "considering the calculated results of the first and second harmonics and the small scale anisotropy all together , the model of @xmath108 and the number fraction of @xmath5 ( the source number density of @xmath6 mpc@xmath7 ) seems to reproduce the observations better than another parameter sets .",
    "however , due to the small number of observed events , the statistics for the two point correlation function is limited .",

    "at first , we explored the source model consistent with the current observations , as a function of the limiting magnitudes of galaxies .",
    "the energy spectrum for the strong egmf shows the extension beyond @xmath10 ev .",

    "it is suspected that cosmic rays above @xmath10 ev ( hereafter ehecrs ; extremely - high energy cosmic rays ) are strongly concentrated in a single center , even if the extension of the energy spectrum is explained .",
    "therefore , large fraction of ehecrs observed by the agasa might originate from sources other than ones of uhecr with energies of @xmath185 ev",
    ". the number density of ehecr source must be much larger than @xmath184 mpc@xmath7 .",
    "we can put forward two candidates as such ehecr production site .",
    "it is suggested that iron ions from the surfaces of young strongly magnetized neutron stars may be accelerated to @xmath10 ev through relativistic mhd winds @xcite .",
    "however , it seems to be difficult to obtain sufficiently isotropic arrival directions of ehecrs from sources localized in the galactic plane by deflection due to the galactic magnetic field @xcite .    the decay of some supermassive particles , which could be produced from tds , or be certain msrps , are also considered as probable ehecrs origin . decay rate of the supermassive particles required to explain the observed ehecr flux are estimated as @xmath186 mpc@xmath7 yr@xmath53 @xcite .",
    "multiplying by the current ehecr observing time ( @xmath187 yr ) , we obtain the number density of @xmath188 mpc@xmath7 , which is sufficiently large to reproduce not clustered agasa 8 ehecrs . as for the large scale anisotropy , distribution of tds in the universe would be homogeneous .",
    "msrps are expected to be clustered in galactic halos , and thus ehecr flux will be dominated by contribution from our own galactic halo .",
    "accordingly , arrival distribution would be isotropic enough to be consistent with the current agasa observation in both cases .",
    "furthermore , these scenarios are not constrained by contribution to the cosmic ray flux at lower energy which must be smaller than observed one , since hard injection spectrum is generally predicted .",
    "for the reasons stated above , the top - down scenarios may be favored to explain large fraction of the 8 ehecrs observed by the agasa .",
    "there is a problem if all the ehecrs observed by the agasa originate from sources other than those of uhecrs .",
    "if we consider that sources of ehecrs and uhecrs precisely differ from each other , there would be no clustered event set which includes both ehecrs and uhecrs , because clustered events are expected to reflect a single point source .",
    "however , 2 ehecrs out of 8 observed by the agasa constitute the clustered events with uhecrs with energies of @xmath104 ev ( c1 and c3 in hayashida et al.(2000 ) ) .",
    "we have to interpret that the two clusters happen to be produced by chance .",
    "chance probability of more than two accidental clusterings within @xmath189 between 49 uhecrs and 8 ehecrs is quite low @xmath190 .",
    "the agasa observation seems to deviate from our prediction with @xmath191 confidence level .",
    "however , about 1 ehecr out of 8 may originate in the bottom - up scenarios .",
    "indeed , 57 cosmic rays above @xmath102 ev predicted by the source model of figure  [ fig21 ] include an ehecr . in this case , since the source of this single event will be located within the gzk sphere , it is likely that this event constitutes a clustered event set with uhecrs .",
    "chance probability of more than one accidental clustering rise up to @xmath192 , which is high enough for us to interpret one of the two doublets to be produced merely by chance .",
    "thus , our scenario is consistent with the current agasa observation within 1 @xmath16 level .",
    "the event correlation between ehecrs and uhecrs would provide an important test of our conclusion with sufficient amount of data from future experiments .",
    "for example , when the event number of uhecrs above @xmath102 increases to 10 times as many as that of the current agasa observation ( 57 ) , the number of ehecrs which lie within @xmath189 from uhecrs by chance becomes @xmath193 .",
    "if future experiments observe event number of such ehecrs within this range , our scenario will be supported . here",
    "we note that the source number within the gzk sphere is at most 1 in the case of nf=@xmath169 .",
    "therefore the number of event clustering between an ehecr and an uhecr which can be explained by bottom - up scenarios is at most 1 .",
    "another test of our conclusion is distinguishing the chemical composition of primary cosmic rays which initiate air showers in the earth atmosphere . in the bottom - up scenarios , protons or nuclei",
    "are primary particles . on the other hand ,",
    "photons are considered as primary in the top - down scenarios @xcite .",
    "information on the chemical composition is mainly provided by the depth of shower maximum for fluorescence observation of the air shower .",
    "there are a number of projects utilizing the fluorescence technique , such as hires @xcite , south and north auger @xcite , owl @xcite and euso @xcite .",
    "these experiment would provide information on the chemical composition and a test of our conclusion .",
    "the hires collaboration @xcite reported the cosmic ray flux from @xmath181 ev to over @xmath10 ev including the gzk cutoff @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , we showed that the three observable quantities except for ehecr events observed by the agasa can be reproduced in the case that the number fraction @xmath5 of the ors galaxies more luminous than @xmath4 mag is selected as uhecr sources . in figure",
    "[ fig22 ] , we show the predicted energy spectrum fitted to the data measured by hires - i detector in the case of @xmath180 . as easily seen , the fit is good as compared with the middle panel of figure  [ fig18 ] .",
    "if the flux measured by the hires collaboration is correct and observational features about the arrival distribution are same as the agasa , our source model can explain both the arrival distribution of uhecrs and the flux at the same time .",

    "indeed , smialkowski et al.(2002 ) showed that arrival distribution of uhecrs predicted by lirgs is sufficiently isotropic such that statistical tests they used for large scale anisotropy was not conclusive for distinguishing between isotropic and lirgs source distribution .",
    "furthermore , they showed that the probability of occurring the clustered events are more than 10 times higher for lirgs source distribution than that for isotopic distribution .",
    "their results well agree with ours .",
    "our result is supported by a statistical analysis of clustering of uhecrs developed by dubovsky et al.(2000 ) , which allow an estimate of the minimum number density of sources .",
    "they applied their arguments to the 14 events above @xmath10 ev observed by several experiments .",
    "they obtained the minimum number density of sources @xmath205 mpc@xmath7 .",
    "since we are now considering uhecrs below @xmath10 ev , we have to apply the arguments given in their paper to the cosmic ray events below @xmath10 ev .",
    "let us apply the arguments to the 49 events with energies of @xmath185 ev observed by the agasa . according to them",
    ", the number density must be larger than @xmath206 where @xmath207 , @xmath208 , @xmath209 are the total number of events , the number of events in clusters , e - folding length of cosmic ray luminosity from a single source respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath209 can be obtained as @xmath210 mpc from figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "taking @xmath211 and @xmath212 , eq .",
    "(  [ minnum ] ) gives @xmath213 mpc@xmath7 which is consistent with our result @xmath6 mpc@xmath7 .      throughout the paper",
    ", we assumed that the statistical properties of the egmf are uniform .",
    "however , simple analytical arguments based on magnetic flux freezing , and large scale structure simulations passively including the magnetic field @xcite demonstrate that the magnetic field is most likely as structured as are the baryons .",
    "the egmf as strong as @xmath214 g in sheets and filaments of large scale galaxy distribution , such as in the lsc , are compatible with existing upper limits on faraday rotation @xcite .",
    "it is suspected that the arrival distribution of uhecrs depends on the fields in the immediate environment of the observer",
    ".    however , numerical simulations of uhecr propagation in inhomogeneous egmf over cosmological distances are highly time - consuming . with the assumption of homogeneous egmf ,",
    "we have performed numerical simulation of spherically symmetric propagation . provided that the egmf is inhomogeneous , the propagation of uhecrs from a single point source has no longer spherical symmetry . as a result , we have to specify the earth position in the universe .",
    "we also have to choose the detector ( earth ) size so small enough for us to accurately calculate the arrival directions . in this case , the number fraction of uhecrs arriving at the earth to injected ones is extremely small .",
    "this requires the number of particle to be propagated several orders of magnitudes higher than that used in this study , which takes enormous cpu time .",
    "although the strong egmf in the lsc is compatible with the faraday ratation measures , the cosmic ray observations do not appear to support such local egmf .",
    "indeed , we showed in this study that small scale clustering can be well reproduced in the case that uhecrs propagate along nearly straight lines .",
    "if the local strong egmf affects the arrival directions of uhecrs , small scale clustering observed by the agasa will not be obtained .",
    "this difficulty can be seen from the studies by another authors .",
    "there are several groups who study the propagation of uhecr in such strong egmf in the lsc @xcite .",
    "they assume simplified source distributions which represent the lsc .",
    "the strong egmf of @xmath214 g leads to substantial deflections of uhecrs , which are better for explaining the observed isotropic arrival distribution of uhecrs . however , consistency of small scale anisotropy and also large scale isotropy predicted by their scenarios with the agasa observation is somewhat worse than that predicted by our scenario .",
    "the strong egmf in the lsc seems to be unfavored by the current cosmic ray observation , although it is not ruled out by the faraday rotation measurements .    of course ,",
    "since the event number of uhecrs is currently very small , we can not absolutely rule out such strong egmf in the lsc .",
    "fulture experiments would increase the significance level of statement about whether such strong egmf affects the arrival directions of uhecrs or not .",
    "in this section , we present our conclusions obtained from comprehensive study on the bottom - up scenarios . for the origin of ehecrs , we conclude that large fraction of the agasa 8 events above @xmath10 ev might originate in the topdown scenarios , or that the cosmic ray flux measured by the hires experiment might be better .",
    "we also discussed the origin of uhecrs below @xmath9 ev through comparisons between the number density of astrophysical source candidates and our result ( @xmath6 mpc@xmath7 ) . at present",
    ", we can not conclude which source candidates are responsible for uhecrs below @xmath9 ev",
    ". however , our result for the source number density ( @xmath6 mpc@xmath7 ) will be useful when searching for the ultimate uhecr source .    throughout the paper",
    ", we set constraints to the source models so that their predictions reproduce the current agasa observation within 1 @xmath16 error of the statistical fluctuation due to finite number of the observed events .",
    "however , if we relax the constraints to within 2 @xmath16 error , the energy spectrum ( figure  [ fig9 ] and  [ fig10 ] ) and the amplitude of the second harmonics ( figure  [ fig12 ] ) can be reproduced in the case of @xmath215 without the source selection . in this case , since the source number density is @xmath216 mpc@xmath7 , there are @xmath217 sources within the gzk sphere .",
    "the agasa events above @xmath10 ev , which do not constitute the clustered events with each other , may also be reproduced , contrary to the case of the source number density of @xmath6 mpc@xmath7 .",
    "thus , we can not absolutely rule out the bottom - up scenarios as the origin of ehecrs .",
    "the statistics for the quantities which we used is limited by the small number of observed events , which make difficult to draw a decisive conclusion on the origin of uhecrs . however , the present working or development of large - aperture new detectors , such as hires @xcite and south and north auger @xcite will considerably decrease the statistical uncertainties .",
    "there are furthermore plans for space based air shower detectors such as owl @xcite and euso @xcite which would detect about 1000 events per year above @xmath10 ev @xcite . with the method to constrain the source model and their number density developed in this paper",
    ", these experiments will reveal the origin of uhecrs with better significance in the very near future .",
