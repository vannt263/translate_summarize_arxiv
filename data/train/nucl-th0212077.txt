    "the independent particle shell model , describing a nucleus as a system of nucleons moving in a mean field , reproduces many basic features of nuclear structure .",
    "it is however well - known that the repulsive components of the nn - interaction induce additional short - range correlations ( src ) which are beyond a mean field description and whose investigation can provide additional insight into the nuclear structure .",
    "a powerful tool for the investigation of src are electromagnetic two - nucleon knockout reactions like @xmath2 or @xmath3 , since the probability that a real or a virtual photon is absorbed by a pair of nucleons should be a direct measure for the correlations between these nucleons ( for an overview , see @xcite ) . however , this simple picture has to be modified because additional complications have to be taken into account",
    ". in particular , competing mechanisms like contributions of two - body currents as well as final state interactions ( fsi ) between the two outgoing nucleons and the residual nucleus have to be considered .",
    "however , it turned out in previous studies @xcite that it is at least in principle possible to determine specific kinematical situations where the reaction cross section is particularly sensitive to src .    due to the complexity of the subject",
    ", several approximations have been performed in the past , which restrict the reliability of the existing models ( consider @xcite and the references therein ) with respect to the interpretation of the existing experimental data . in this context ,",
    "one crucial assumption is the fact that the mutual interaction between the two outgoing nucleons , denoted as nn - fsi , can be neglected . at the moment",
    "no reliable estimate of this approximation exists for two - nucleon knockout on finite nuclei .",
    "indeed , recent calculations on nuclear matter @xcite clearly indicate that nn - fsi are non - negligible even if the two detected nucleons are ejected back to back in the so - called superparallel kinematics , where nn - fsi are expected to be minimal .",
    "however , a study in nuclear matter does not provide results for cross sections which can directly be compared with experimental data produced for a specific target nucleus .",
    "a consistent treatment of fsi would require in general a genuine three - body approach for the mutual interaction of the two protons and the residual nucleus ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_mechanism ] ) . presumably due to the enormous computational challenges",
    ", this has never been tackled in the past . before starting such an ambitious project",
    ", it may be recommendable to estimate first within an approximative , but more feasible treatment the qualitative role of nn - fsi .",
    "this has been done in the present work using as underlying framework the unfactorized approach for two - nucleon knockout on complex , but finite nuclei presented in @xcite .",
    "if nn - fsi in these studies turned out to be small , a complete three - body calculation would not be necessary and the previous treatment of neglecting nn - fsi completely could be justified .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . the theoretical framework and the adopted approximations",
    "are outlined in sect .",
    "numerical results for some selected kinematical situations are presented in sect .",
    "[ res ] , where also some perspectives of possible improvements and future developments are given .",
    "the cross section for electromagnetic two - proton - knockout is given in general by the square of the scalar product of the relativistic electron current @xmath4 and of the nuclear current @xmath5 , where the latter is given by the fourier transform of the transition matrix element of the charge - current density operator between initial and final nuclear states @xmath6    concerning the nuclear current @xmath7 and the initial state @xmath8 of the two emitted protons , the general framework described in @xcite has been adopted without any modification .",
    "thus , the nuclear current operator @xmath7 is the sum of a one- and a two - body part .",
    "the one - body part consists of the usual charge operator and the convection and spin current . in the two - body part",
    "the nonrelativistic pionic seagull and flight meson - exchange current do not contribute in two - proton emission , so that only intermediate @xmath9 isobar excitation has to be considered @xcite .    for the @xmath0 reaction , the initial state @xmath8",
    "is taken from the calculation of the two - proton spectral function of @xmath10 in @xcite , where long - range and short - range correlations are consistently taken into account . the latter are included in the radial wave functions of relative motion through defect functions , which were obtained by solving the bethe - goldstone equation for @xmath10 in momentum space .",
    "as has already been outlined in the introduction , several approximations have been used in the past concerning the final state @xmath11 . in the simplest approach any interaction between the two protons and the residual nucleus",
    "is neglected and a plane - wave approximation ( pw ) is assumed for the two outgoing protons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_mechanism ] ) . in the more sophisticated approach of @xcite ,",
    "the interaction between each of the outgoing protons and the residual nucleus is considered by using a complex phenomenological optical potential @xmath12 for nucleon - nucleus scattering which contains a central , a coulomb and a spin - orbit term @xcite ( see diagram ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig_mechanism ] ) . under the simplifying assumption of an infinite heavy residual nucleus",
    ", the corresponding final state can be expressed as the _ product _ of two uncoupled single - particle distorted wave functions ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the latter are given by the solution of the corresponding schrdinger equation @xmath14 with @xmath15 denoting the kinetic energy operator and @xmath16 the asymptotic free momentum of the outgoing proton @xmath17 , with kinetic energy @xmath18 in the used laboratory frame .",
    "in practice , the finite mass @xmath19 of the residual nucleus @xmath1 is taken into account by performing in ( [ op - equation ] ) the transformation @xcite ( @xmath20 ) @xmath21\\ ] ] where @xmath22 denotes the mass of the outgoing proton ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath23 the recoil momentum of the residual nucleus @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , a semirelativistic generalization of ( [ op - equation ] ) has been used as discussed in @xcite .    in all previous work ,",
    "the mutual nn - interaction @xmath24 between the two outgoing protons ( nn - fsi ) was neglected . in the present study ,",
    "this approximation is dropped by incorporating for the first time the corresponding complete nn - scattering amplitude @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) @xmath27 with @xmath28 up to the first order in the final state , as it has been depicted in diagram ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_mechanism ] . for the sake of simplicity , multiscattering processes like those described by diagrams ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig_mechanism ] are still neglected .",
    "the final state @xmath11 in ( [ eq1 ] ) is therefore given in our approach by @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes a plane wave state of the proton @xmath17 with momentum @xmath16 .",
    "within this treatment of fsi , we are still far away from having solved the complete three - body problem of the final state .",
    "nevertheless , we are able to obtain a first reliable estimate of the relevance of nn - fsi in various kinematical situations of two - proton knockout .    in our explicit evaluation",
    ", we have used in ( [ tnn ] ) as nn - potential @xmath24 the bonn obepq - a potential @xcite which has also been used for the calculation of the defect functions in the initial state . due to the nonlocality of this potential , the term @xmath31 in ( [ fsi - state ] )",
    "is explicitly evaluated in momentum space .",
    "the initial state @xmath8 and the nuclear current @xmath7 in ( [ eq1 ] ) are however calculated in configuration space , so that finally an appropriate fourier transformation of the nn - fsi from momentum to configuration space had to be performed .",
    "moreover , we would like to mention that a usual partial wave decomposition @xcite of the nn - interaction @xmath24 has been adopted taking into account all isospin 1 partial nn - waves up to an orbital angular momentum of 3 , i.e.   the @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 contributions .",
    "it has been checked numerically that the contribution of @xmath35 and @xmath36 nn - waves is negligible , at least for the kinematics considered here .",
    "in this section , we discuss the influence of nn - fsi for two different types of kinematics which have already been under experimental investigation @xcite .",
    "we call @xmath37 the incident electron energy and @xmath38 the electron scattering angle in the laboratory frame .",
    "the energy and momentum transfer is denoted , as usual , as @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the angles between the momentum transfer @xmath41 and the momenta @xmath42 and @xmath43 of the outgoing protons are called @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    concerning the different approximations for the final state , we denote as pw the plane - wave approximation , where fsi are completely neglected , and as dw the treatment of @xcite , where only the optical potential @xmath12 is taken into account .",
    "in the approach pw - nn we consider the alternative case where only @xmath24 , but not @xmath12 , is included .",
    "the corresponding final states in these different approximations are given by @xmath46 our full approach in ( [ fsi - state ] ) is denoted as dw - nn .",
    "the results of these different approaches on the cross section of the @xmath0 reaction for the transition to the @xmath47 ground state of @xmath1 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in the left panel",
    "the superparallel kinematics of a mainz experiment @xcite is considered , with @xmath48 mev , @xmath49 , @xmath50 mev , @xmath51 mev/@xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . in the right panel",
    "an alternative kinematical setup , which has been included in a nikhef experiment @xcite , is investigated , with @xmath55 mev , @xmath56 , @xmath57 mev and @xmath58 mev/@xmath52 .",
    "the angle @xmath44 is @xmath59 , on the opposite side of the outgoing electron with respect to @xmath41 .",
    "the kinetic energy of proton 1 is fixed to @xmath60 mev .    by changing the kinetic energy of the outgoing protons in the superparallel kinematics and the angle @xmath45 in the nikhef setup , we are able to explore different values of the recoil momentum of the residual nucleus @xmath61 .",
    "positive ( negative ) values of @xmath62 in the left panel refer to situations where @xmath23 is parallel ( antiparallel ) to the momentum transfer .",
    "it is well known and can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the inclusion of the optical potential leads to an overall and substantial reduction of the cross section in both kinematical setups ( consider the difference between the pw and dw results ) . on the other hand ,",
    "our calculations give a considerable enhancement for medium and large recoil momenta in the superparallel kinematics if nn - fsi are taken into account ( see the difference between pw and pw - nn , and between dw and dw - nn ) . the effect of nn - fsi amounts to about one order of magnitude enhancement at @xmath63 mev/@xmath52 .",
    "thus even at back - to - back kinematics the mutual interaction of the two outgoing protons can not be neglected . in the nikhef kinematics ,",
    "the effect of nn - fsi is also sizeable , although not as strong as in the superparallel kinematics .",
    "moreover , whereas in the superparallel kinematics the relative effect of nn - fsi increases for decreasing cross section , in the nikhef kinematics nn - fsi is maximal when also the cross section is maximal , i.e. for @xmath64 , which corresponds to @xmath65 mev/@xmath52 .",
    "this result clearly shows that the role of nn - fsi is strongly dependent on the kinematics and no general statement can be drawn with respect to its relevance .    as is known from previous work @xcite , in the @xmath0 reaction the transition to the @xmath47 ground state of @xmath1 is governed dominantly by the @xmath66 partial wave in the initial relative state of the two protons .",
    "a sizeable contribution arises moreover from the @xmath67 state .",
    "the relative importance of nn - fsi on these two partial waves is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for the kinematical setups already considered in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in both kinematics",
    "the effect of nn - fsi is more important on the @xmath66 initial state .",
    "the effect on this single state gives in practice almost the full contribution of nn - fsi .",
    "for the @xmath67 initial state only a negligible effect is given in the nikhef kinematics .",
    "the effect is somewhat larger in the superparallel kinematics , but also here it is completely overwhelmed in the final result by the dominant contribution of the @xmath66 state .",
    "the role of nn - fsi on the @xmath68 initial relative states is of specifical relevance for the transition to the @xmath69 excited state of @xmath1 , where only @xmath68 components are present and the @xmath66 relative partial wave can not contribute .",
    "the results for this transition in the superparallel kinematics are depicted in fig .",
    "a negligible effect is due to nn - fsi in the pw - nn approach .",
    "a significant enhancement is obtained in the dw - nn calculation , especially for negative values of @xmath62 , where the cross section has a minimum .    summarizing",
    ", we have studied the importance of the mutual final state interaction of the two emitted protons in the @xmath0 reaction within a perturbative treatment .",
    "our results indicate that nn - fsi can be important in particular situations and in general can not be neglected .",
    "it has been clearly shown that the role of nn - fsi depends on kinematics and on the final state in the excitation spectrum of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , one may hope that it is possible to find specific kinematical situations where the effects of fsi are as small as possible , in order to achieve the most direct access to src in complex nuclei .",
    "this requires a systematic study of the role of fsi for different kinematics which is presently under consideration .",
    "moreover , due to our numerical results , the full three - body problem of the final state has to be tackled in forthcoming studies . in that context",
    ", special emphasis has to be devoted to a more consistent treatment of the initial and the final state in our approach .",
