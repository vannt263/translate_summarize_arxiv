    "even though scalable quantum computers can not be built using current technology , the fact that they may become possible in the future has an impact on present - day information security .",
    "the relatively recent field of post - quantum cryptography @xcite therefore studies classical schemes that remain secure if the adversary possesses a quantum computer .",
    "( here and throughout the paper , `` classical '' is taken to mean `` non - quantum '' . )",
    "since the subject of post - quantum cryptography is the security of present classical technology against future quantum attacks , the usual assumption is that only the adversary possesses quantum capabilities .",
    "this means that all communication between the adversary and the legitimate parties , in particular oracle access , is assumed to be classical .    in 2013 ,",
    "boneh and zhandry @xcite went beyond this paradigm by introducing a security model in which the adversary is given quantum superposition access to encryption and decryption oracles .",
    "their work is of considerable conceptual interest .",
    "in addition , it may become practically relevant in a future technological landscape where some cryptographic protocols are implemented on quantum computers .",
    "boneh and zhandry define a notion of indistinguishability ( ind ) in chosen plaintext ( cpa ) and chosen ciphertext ( cca ) attacks through a game with two phases . in the first phase ( the query phase )",
    "the adversary is given unrestricted superposition oracle access .",
    "in the second phase ( the challenge phase ) the adversary is only allowed to make classical queries .",
    "why is there a restriction in the challenge phase ? in their paper ,",
    "boneh and zhandry show that some restriction is necessary .",
    "the reason is , effectively , that a quantum computer can easily distinguish between the encryption of a single message and the encryption of an equal superposition of all possible messages , independently of the details of the encryption .",
    "the restriction to classical challenge queries prevents the adversary to exploit this fact and allows boneh and zhandry to prove that their security notion is achievable .",
    "it is worth pointing out that even in standard ( classical ) indistinguishability notions it is necessary to restrict the class of allowed challenge queries , to prevent the adversary from winning the game trivially by exploiting information about , e.g. , message length .",
    "there is a sense , however , in which a restriction to classical challenge queries seems too strong . considering quantum oracle access",
    "makes sense only in view of a future technological environment in which the legitimate parties use quantum computers .",
    "in such an environment , it is likely that the encryption schemes considered here will form part of a wider quantum communication infrastructure . without a precise specification of the nature of this infrastructure",
    ", one should not rule out a priori the possibility that an adversary might benefit from the ability to distinguish between superpositions of messages or ciphertexts .",
    "in this paper we introduce an achievable security notion where the adversary has full superposition access to an oracle .",
    "we define an indistinguishability ( ind ) notion in both chosen plaintext ( cpa ) and chosen ciphertext ( cca ) attacks .",
    "our ind notion , which we call `` real or permutation '' ( rop ) , is equivalent to standard ind notions in the case of classical oracle queries , but is immune to the attack discovered by boneh and zhandry in the case of quantum superposition queries .",
    "it also falls outside the classification of security notions recently given by gagliardoni , hlsing and schaffner @xcite .",
    "it would be worthwhile to study the relationship between our cpa notion and the qind - qcpa notion defined in @xcite . whereas we consider direct quantum - mechanical interaction between adversary and oracle , qind - qcpa requires the adversary to submit classical descriptions of its quantum queries .    in a rop experiment ,",
    "the adversary is given access to one of two encryption oracles .",
    "one oracle simply encrypts challenge messages chosen by the adversary , whereas the other oracle applies a random permutation to the message and then encrypts it .",
    "the adversary s goal is to distinguish between the two cases . for classical queries , applying a random permutation to",
    "a message is equivalent to replacing the message by a random string . for classical queries ,",
    "the rop security notion is therefore equivalent to the `` real or random '' notion defined in @xcite . in the quantum case",
    ", the rop notion allows for arbitrary quantum superposition queries in all phases of the experiment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we describe our security model , for which we adopt the concrete - security paradigm @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : qprf ] discusses quantum pseudorandom functions ( qprf ) and their existence from the concrete - security standpoint . in section  [ sec : cpa ] we define our real or permutation ind - cpa notion and show that it is achieved by a slight modification of a standard construction .",
    "the cca case is the topic of section  [ sec : cca ] .",
    "the proof that the rop ind - cca notion is achievable is the main contribution of this paper .",
    "the proof contains new ideas and substantial input from quantum information theory .",
    "in this paper we address the security of symmetric encryption schemes against quantum adversaries @xcite .",
    "we adopt the usual definition of a symmetric encryption scheme as a triple @xmath0 consisting of a ( randomized ) key generation algorithm @xmath1 , a ( randomized ) encryption algorithm that takes a plaintext @xmath2 and a key @xmath3 and returns a ciphertext @xmath4 , and a decryption algorithm satisfying @xmath5 for all messages @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that @xmath6 is randomized , i.e. , its output depends on a string @xmath7 which is chosen randomly each time @xmath6 is invoked .",
    "we will consider both chosen plaintext attacks ( cpa ) , where an adversary is given access to an encryption oracle , and chosen ciphertext attacks ( cca ) , where the adversary in addition has access to a decryption oracle .",
    "we will assume that both @xmath6 and @xmath8 are implemented on a quantum computer @xcite , and that the adversary is given superposition access to the corresponding oracles . by this we mean",
    ", roughly , that the adversary can make encryption queries consisting of quantum superpositions of messages , to which the oracle responds with a corresponding superposition of ciphertexts , and similarly for decryption queries in the cca case .    formally we define a superposition query as follows . for any function @xmath9",
    "we define a unitary transformation , @xmath10 , on a @xmath11-qubit register by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an @xmath14-bit string , @xmath15 is an @xmath16-bit string , and @xmath17 the _ computational basis states _ ,",
    "form an orthonormal basis of @xmath18-dimensional complex hilbert space .",
    "equation ( [ eq : generalquantumquery ] ) defines the action of @xmath10 for arbitrary quantum states on the quantum register , including superposition states and including the case that the register is entangled with some other quantum register .    in this scenario ,",
    "an encryption query consists in the application of the unitary @xmath19 to a quantum register under the control of the adversary , and similarly for a decryption query .",
    "we place no restrictions on the initial state of the adversary s register .",
    "if the initial state is of the superposition form @xmath20 with arbitrary complex coefficients @xmath21 , the result of the query is @xmath22    the resources required to apply the unitary @xmath19 to a quantum register are independent of the initial state @xmath23 of the register . applying a unitary can be thought of as a single physical operation , for which the number of terms in the superposition state @xmath23 is irrelevant .",
    "since the encryption oracle does not `` know '' whether it acts on a superposition or on a single basis state , we will assume that the random string @xmath7 required for the randomized encryption is chosen exactly once every time @xmath19 is applied .",
    "this means that @xmath7 is the same for all terms in the sum in eq .",

    "we will denote this process by @xmath28 we will assume that @xmath24 maintains a quantum register @xmath29 for the purpose of making oracle queries , a quantum register @xmath30 for doing quantum computations and for storing its internal state between invocations , and a register @xmath31 for classical input and output . passing an argument @xmath25 to @xmath24",
    "is done by placing @xmath25 into the register @xmath31 .",

    "we adopt the concrete security framework @xcite . instead of focusing on polynomial algorithms in an asymptotic sense , concrete security concerns bounds on an adversary s success probability as a function of the actual resources available to the adversary .",
    "the most relevant resources for the purposes of this paper are the running time of a quantum adversary @xmath24 , and the number of oracle queries made by @xmath24 .",
    "we define the running time as the time , in seconds , that elapses until @xmath24 writes its final output and halts , including any initialization steps .",
    "there exist a number of further potentially important resource parameters , such as memory size , or the number of qubits required by @xmath24 , but since these do not play any explicit role in the reduction arguments given below , we will not discuss them here .",
    "our reduction arguments can be read in a very `` concrete '' way , e.g. , `` if there exists a specific quantum adversary that , in @xmath35 seconds and using @xmath36 oracle queries achieves an advantage of @xmath37 in an attack on scheme @xmath38 , then one can construct another quantum adversary that , also in @xmath35 seconds and using @xmath36 oracles queries , achieves an advantage of at least @xmath39 in an attack on scheme @xmath40 . ''",
    "working within the concrete - security paradigm and measuring running time in seconds rather than as the number of , say , gate operations has the clear advantage that it leads to definitions and theorems which are independent of any particular computing or quantum computing model .",
    "in a concrete security framework , a quantum pseudorandom function , or qprf , is simply a family of functions .",
    "what turns a family of functions into a qprf is a pair of experiments that defines an adversary s _",

    "for these schemes to be secure , we need to assume that there exists a function family @xmath56 such that its qprf - advantage is extremely small for any quantum adversary using resources that are available now or might become available in the foreseeable future .",

    "the best currently known quantum attack against aes-256 uses grover s search algorithm @xcite and requires of the order of @xmath57 queries to find the encryption key with high probability .",

    "that is , @xmath170 is the set of ciphertexts that have zero weight in all encryption queries , i.e. , @xmath171 where tr denotes the trace .",
    "we can now define the set @xmath172 as the set of pairs @xmath173 that do not result from any encryption query , @xmath174 since @xmath175 trying to guess @xmath176 given a ciphertext @xmath177 leads to a valid pair with very small probability .",
    "the results of the @xmath126 encryption queries contain no information about the set @xmath172 .",
    "now let @xmath178 be the state of the quantum register before the @xmath25-th decryption query in scenario q1 , and define @xmath179 we can now define @xmath180 as the total weight of terms belonging to @xmath172 in the @xmath25-th decryption query ( @xmath181 ) , @xmath182 this can be re - expressed as follows . let @xmath183 be the state of the totality of the adversary s quantum registers immediately before the @xmath25-th decryption query in scenario q1 , @xmath184 which can be expanded in the form @xmath185 where @xmath90 labels the computational basis states of all internal registers ( i.e. , all registers in addition to the register @xmath29 ) .",
    "we then have @xmath186 the probability that a direct measurement after the @xmath25-th decryption query gives a string @xmath187 is then given by the expectation value @xmath188 .",
    "now the optimal way of searching for a string @xmath189 is grover s algorithm @xcite .",
    "as long as @xmath25 is less than the minimum number of queries required for grover s algorithm to succeed with certainty ( which is approximately @xmath190 ) , the best probability with which any quantum algorithm can find a string @xmath187 using @xmath25 queries is exactly the probability @xmath191 achieved by running grover s algorithm with @xmath25 queries @xcite .",

    "@xmath194    by measuring the quantum register after the @xmath25-th query and then stopping , the quantum adversary can find a string @xmath195 with probability @xmath196 .",

    "therefore , for the trace distance we have @xmath211 for arbitrary @xmath212 , the triangle inequality gives us @xmath213 by induction , it follows that @xmath214    this implies that , for any measurement , the probabilities for @xmath151 in both scenarios can not differ by more than the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : induction ] ) .",
    "now the expectation of that quantity is @xmath215 using the markov inequality this implies , for any @xmath216 , @xmath217 that is , with probability at least @xmath218 , we have that @xmath219 irrespectively of the value of the bit @xmath50 .",
    "it follows that @xmath220 we can now choose @xmath221 so that this has the most convenient form .",
