    "the standard method for the analysis of an individual x - ray source is the subtraction of the background from the observed total count rate .",
    "this approach overcomes the main uncertainties introduced by the so - called non - cosmic x - ray background radiation as well as residual contamination by scattered solar x - rays .",
    "however , if the background radiation itself is the main interest , one needs excellent detectors and a clear understanding of the residual contamination of the data , which is not automatically rejected by the detector electronics or the raw - data processing .",
    "the pspc was a superb detector to investigate the background emission , especially for the analysis of the soft x - ray emission within the @xmath1kev band . towards the high galactic latitude sky , the product of the neutral hydrogen column density and the interstellar photoelectric absorption cross section reaches at least unity within the @xmath1kev energy band .",
    "accordingly , @xmath1kev soft x - ray shadows of individual clouds are expected for clouds located in front of an extended x - ray source .",
    "the first maps of the diffuse soft x - ray background ( mccammon et al .",
    "@xcite ) did not resolve individual cloud shadows , but confirmed the general negative correlation between the soft x - ray background intensity distribution and the galactic neutral hydrogen distribution ( bowyer , field and mack @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the wisconsin survey established the existence of a @xmath2k plasma in the local void of neutral matter , the so - called local hot bubble ( lhb , cox & reynolds @xcite ) .",
    "one of the first major discoveries of the mission was the detection of the `` draco shadow '' by snowden et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath1kev shadow of this cloud , which is located outside the lhb , gave evidence for an x - ray emitting plasma beyond the lhb .",
    "this x - ray emitting plasma within the galactic halo was attributed to an individual hot spot ( burrows & mendenhall @xcite ) . during the course of the mission",
    ", more @xmath1kev x - ray shadows of neutral clouds were discovered ( i.e. kerp et al .",
    "@xcite , snowden et al .",
    "@xcite , herbstmeier et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "there has been a lot of discussion about whether the distant x - ray emission is associated with a smoothly distributed x - ray emitting plasma within the galactic halo ( kerp et al .",
    "@xcite , pietz et al .",
    "@xcite , freyberg @xcite ) or whether it is the superposition of individual scattered hot spots ( snowden et al .",
    "@xcite , shelton @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we will demonstrate that a smooth , constant intensity distribution of the halo x - ray plasma , quantitatively fits the observed soft x - ray background ( sxrb ) intensity distribution ( sect.2 ) very well .",
    "this modelling of the sxrb intensity distribution allows us to disclose sky areas of too faint or too bright soft x - ray emission .",
    "this approach provides evidence that some hvcs are associated with @xmath1kev soft x - ray emission ( sect.3 ) .",
    "figure  [ radtrans ] shows the application of our model to the sxrb intensity distribution , step - by - step .",
    "the intensity profiles ( fig .",
    "[ radtrans ] _ left _ ) are extracted from the corresponding maps ( fig .",
    "[ radtrans ] _ right _ ) .",
    "the arrows mark the ( constant ) galactic latitude position of the slices , while the intensity profiles are a function of the galactic longitude .",
    "[ radtrans]*a ) * shows the assumed constant intensity distribution of the x - ray halo .",
    "the unabsorbed intensity level seen on the y - axis of the intensity profile is @xmath3 .    in panel * b ) * , the soft x - ray attenuating column density distribution of @xmath4 is shown .",
    "black indicates low column densities , and white high column densities . on the left",
    "the corresponding slice at @xmath5 shows that the column density , @xmath4 , varies between @xmath6 .",
    "* c ) * shows the modelled @xmath1kev intensity distribution of @xmath7 ( panel * a ) * ) absorbed by the galactic interstellar matter ( @xmath4 ; panel * b ) * ) .",
    "the longitude profile on the left @xmath7 is attenuated by a factor of 3 to 5 .",
    "the minimum x - ray intensity level of @xmath8 is a superposition of the attenuated @xmath7 and the foreground @xmath9 .",
    "thus , towards high @xmath4 regions , only 40% of the detected x - ray photons have their origin in the galactic halo plasma ; the rest originates from the lhb .",
    "the unabsorbed intensities are @xmath10 .",
    "finally , in panel * d ) * , we present the data for this @xmath11 region . the left panel shows a superposition of the observed intensity - profile at @xmath5 from the data and the modelled intensity profile ( thick line ) . considering the uncertainties in the data of about @xmath12",
    ", the observed and modelled intensity profiles agree very well .    using this method , kerp et al .",
    "( @xcite ) analysed four large areas of the x - ray sky to search for signatures of hvcs .",
    "they proved statistically that the modelled and observed map intensity distributions match perfectly .",
    "kerp et al . ( @xcite ) analysed four large fields using the method described above , to search for signatures of hvcs in the data . in fig.[hvcivc ] , we show a mosaic of the data towards the hvc complex c. the field described in fig.[radtrans ] is the lower right area of the mosaic . because of the well modelled intensity distribution of the `` normal '' sxrb ( fig.[radtrans ] ) , we can now examine areas of excess soft x - ray emission by subtracting the model from the observed sxrb intensity distribution .",
    "excess sxrb emission is defined here more significant as residuals @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "[ hvcivc ] ) .",
    "most of the sxrb emission is modelled well , and no large - scale excess emission is found .",
    "the distribution of the soft x - ray excess is patchy , with the most prominent one located close to the position of the draco cloud ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "overall , the galactic x - ray halo has a _ smooth _ large - scale - intensity distribution , while close to some of the hvcs bright excess soft x - ray patches are located .",
    "superimposed on the excess soft x - ray emission ( grey - scale in fig .",
    "[ hvcivc ] ) as contours , is the column density distribution of hvc complex c. although there is no one - to - one positional correlation between the excess x - ray emitting areas and the hvcs , the places where sxrb excesses are seen do coincide with the locations of hvcs .",
    "kerp et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found a total of 12 excess x - ray emitting areas .",
    "integrated across the whole excess area , the detected excess @xmath1kev energy is about @xmath15 .",
    "accordingly , the unabsorbed @xmath1kev x - ray flux is about @xmath16 ( @xmath17}$ ] ) .",
    "the maximum in the @xmath1kev data is @xmath18 , which is only a tiny fraction of the available kinetic energy of hvc complex c ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the emission measure is about @xmath20 , which is roughly 6 times higher than the emission measure of the galactic halo plasma ( @xmath21 , pietz et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the high excess emission measure implies , that the hvc material itself may be partly ionised and heated up to temperatures of about @xmath22k ( kerp et al .",
    "if we compare the volume densities of the electrons and of the neutral hydrogen atoms , we find that @xmath23}$ ] . if we assume that hvcs are `` pure '' hydrogen clouds , this ratio is an estimate of the ionisation fraction of the atomic hydrogen ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we can invert the electron - to - neutral - hydrogen atom density ratio to calculate the distance for a completely ionised hydrogen hvc to be @xmath2511kpc .",
    "this distance limit is close to the observationally determined upper distance limit ( van woerden et al .",
    "@xcite ) and those based on theoretical considerations ( blitz et al .",
    "@xcite ) . we can interpret this high ionisation of hvcs in two ways : first , the determination of the emission measure may be in error , because the collision equilibrium plasma models do not fit the real situation .",
    "second , a significant fraction of the hvcs hydrogen is _ not _ neutral , so the hvcs may have a larger extent and contain more mass than the neutral hydrogen indicates .",
    "this might explain the obvious positional offset between the bright soft x - ray enhancements and the neutral hydrogen column density distribution .",
    "also , some of the @xmath26 emission maxima are found to be not positionally coincident with @xmath4 maxima ( i.e. mi - cloud position 6a , tufte , reynolds and haffner @xcite ) .",
