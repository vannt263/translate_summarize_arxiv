    "nowadays , graphene , the most important crystalline forms of carbon , is one of the most significant topics in solid state physics due to the vast application in nano - electronics , opto - electronics , superconductivity and josephson junctions ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "this material is a two - dimensional sheet of carbon atoms forming a honey - comb lattice made of two interpenetrating - bonded triangular sublattices , a and b. the linear band dispersion at the so called dirac point is a special feature of the graphene band structure which are dictated by the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands that form conical valleys touching at the high symmetry points of the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "a key point is that the linear dispersion near the symmetry points have striking similarities with those of massless relativistic dirac fermions or an effective dirac - weyl hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this leads to a number of fascinating phenomena such as the half - quantized hall effect ( @xcite,@xcite ) and minimum quantum conductivity in the limit of vanishing concentration of charge carriers novo .",
    "another of the effects that change their form , comparing to the electrons described by schrdinger equation , are the landau levels .",
    "these are quantized energy levels for electrons in a magnetic field .",
    "they still appear also for relativistic electrons , just their dependence on field and quantization parameter is different . in a conventional non - relativistic electron gas ,",
    "landau quantization produces equidistant energy levels , which is due to the parabolic dispersion law of free electrons . in graphene ,",
    "the electrons have relativistic dispersion law , which strongly modifies the landau quantization of the energy and the position of the levels .",
    "in particular , they are not equidistant as in conventional case and the largest energy separation is between the zero and the first landau level ( for multilayer graphene see @xcite ) .",
    "this large gap allows one to observe the quantum hall effect in graphene , even at room temperature @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the landau levels in graphene have been observed by measuring cyclotron resonances of the electrons and holes in infrared spectroscopy experiments @xcite and by measuring tunneling current in scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments @xcite .",
    "the experimental study of the @xmath7 landau level has attracted a great deal of attention , and has evolved rapidly , as better quality samples become available , and higher magnetic fields and lower temperatures were studied ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) , but in particular , landau level mixing is neglected ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , and this is not as clearly justified because the single particle landau level gaps in graphene scale as @xmath8 , which is the same as the interaction strength @xcite . in turn , only optical transitions between landau levels has been calculated . since in graphene",
    "both conduction and valence bands have the same symmetry , the optical transition selection rule has the same form for both intraband and interband transition , and is given by the relation @xmath9 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .    in the other side",
    ", it is commonly accepted that graphene has very few lattice defects .",
    "doped graphene shows remarkable high field - effect mobilities , even at room temperatures ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "also it is possible the appearance of negative conductivity in graphene with impurities in magnetic fields ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .    in turn , landau level shift in graphene monolayer subjected to a quantizing perpendicular magnetic field under the influence of short - range @xmath10-potential impurities has been studied using green function method @xcite . however , landau level transitions in graphene with impurities placed in a time - dependent magnetic field has not been theoretically studied , therefore in this work we address this problem using time - dependent perturbation theory , where the free hamiltonian is defined on eq.(2 ) of @xcite , and the interacting hamiltonian is defined in eq.([ss3 ] ) of this work . in particular , the case in which at @xmath11 the quantum state is in the @xmath0 landau level and the possible transition to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 landau level is studied and its relation to revivals and zitterbewegung effect is analized ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the work is organized as follows :    in section 2 , the free hamiltonian and the interacting hamiltonian are introduced and the time - dependent perturbation theory is applied .    in section 3 ,",
    "transition probabilities from @xmath0 to @xmath1 and @xmath2 landau levels are computed and time intervals in which probabilities goes to zero are obtained in terms of the hamiltonian parameters .    in section 4 ,",
    "transitions from the @xmath12landau level to the @xmath13landau level are computed and analyzed .",
    "current probability is obtained showing the expected circular motion with cyclotron frequency .    in section 5 ,",
    "the conclusions are presented .    in appendix",
    "a and c the conservation of probability and current density is computed and in appendix b some useful formulas are introduced .",
    "the hamiltonian of graphene near the dirac point @xmath14 in the long wavelength approximation reads@xmath15where @xmath16 is the fermi velocity that is defined as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( see @xcite ) , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the pauli matrices and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the momentum of the bloch electrons in the graphene plane monolayer ) .",
    "this hamiltonian acts on the electron wavefunctions localized on sublattice @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "using the tight binding approximation , is not difficult to show that if we place an impurity near the atom of the sublattice @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the corresponding hamiltonian can be written as ( see @xcite)@xmath26where @xmath27 is the hybridization potential which reflects the overlap energy between the @xmath28 orbital of the electron in carbon atom and the arbitrary orbital of the impurity atom , and @xmath29 is the energy of the absorbed impurity atom with respect to the fermi level ( these values can be evaluated experimentally ( see @xcite ) ) .",
    "the electron wavefunctions will be a four component vector @xmath30 , where the first two components correspond to @xmath14 dirac point  and the remaining two components correspond to the wave function of electrons localized on the impurity .",
    "if we place the graphene perpendicular to a time dependent magnetic field , the momentum of the bloch electrons will be changed as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the potential vector and @xmath33 is the electron charge .",
    "in particular , we can choose the following gauge @xmath34 in this case , the hamiltonian reads@xmath35    in the following , we will assume that the magnetic field will have the following time dependence    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is a dimensionless coupling constant and where @xmath38 is an arbitrary time - dependent magnetic field . introducing eq.(ss1 ) on eq.([gg3 ] ) we can separate the hamiltonian in two parts @xmath39 , where",
