    "investigations of the @xmath0-nucleus interaction are motivated by various reasons .",
    "some of them , such as the possibility of forming quasi - bound states or resonances @xcite in the @xmath0-nucleus system , are purely of nuclear nature .",
    "the others are related to the study of the properties and structure of the @xmath4 resonance which is strongly coupled to the @xmath5 channel .",
    "for example , it is interesting to investigate the behavior of the @xmath0-meson in nuclear media where , after colliding with the nucleons , it readily forms the @xmath6 resonance .",
    "the interaction of this resonance with the surrounding nucleons can be described in different ways @xcite , depending on whether the structure of this resonance is defined in terms of some quark configurations or by the coupling of meson - baryon channels , as suggested in ref .",
    "the estimation by tiwari _ et al . _",
    "@xcite shows , that in case of pseudoscalar @xmath7 coupling there is an essential density dependent reduction of the @xmath0-meson mass and of the @xmath8 mixing angle .",
    "the importance of the influence of the nuclear medium on the mesons passing through it , was recently emphasized by drechsel _",
    "if this influence is described in terms of self - energies and effective masses , then in the process of @xmath9-meson passing through the nucleus , `` saturation '' of the isobar propagator ( or self - energy ) takes place .",
    "this phenomenon manifests itself even in light nuclei @xcite .",
    "similar ideas were discussed also in ref .",
    "@xcite . in other words ,",
    "the propagation of @xmath0-mesons inside the nucleus is a new challenge for theorists .",
    "another interesting issue related to the @xmath0-nucleus interaction , is the study of charge symmetry breaking , which may partly be attributed to the @xmath10 mixing ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in principle",
    ", one can extract the value of the mixing angle from experiments involving @xmath0-nucleus interaction and compare the results with the predictions of quark models .",
    "however , to do such an extraction , one has to make an extrapolation of the @xmath0-nucleus scattering amplitude into the area of unphysical energies below the @xmath0-nucleus threshold .",
    "this is a highly model dependent procedure requiring reliable treatment of the @xmath0-nucleus dynamics .    in this respect ,",
    "few - body systems such as @xmath11 , @xmath0@xmath12he , and @xmath0@xmath13he , have obvious advantages since they can be treated using rigorous faddeev - type equations .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , so far only the simplest of these systems , namely the @xmath14 system , was considered @xcite within the exact ags theory @xcite .",
    "a solution of the few - body equations presupposes the knowledge of the corresponding two - body @xmath3-matrices @xmath15 and @xmath16 off the energy shell . due to the fact that at low energies the @xmath0 meson interacts with a nucleon mainly via the formation of the @xmath6-resonance ,",
    "the inclusion of the higher partial waves ( @xmath17 ) is unnecessary .",
    "furthermore , since the @xmath2 interaction is poorly known , the effect of the fine tuned details of the `` realistic '' @xmath18 potentials would be far beyond the level of the overall accuracy of the @xmath19 theory .",
    "indeed , in contrast to the well - established @xmath18 forces , the @xmath2 interaction is constructed using very limited information available , namely , the @xmath2 scattering length and the parameters of the @xmath6-resonance .",
    "furthermore , only the resonance parameters are known more or less accurately while the scattering length ( which is complex ) is determined with large uncertainties .",
    "moreover , practically nothing is known about the off - shell behavior of the @xmath2 amplitude .",
    "it is simply assumed that all mesons should have somewhat similar properties and therefore the off - shell behavior of this amplitude could be approximated ( like in the case of @xmath9 mesons ) by appropriate yamaguchi form - factors ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . however , if the available data are used to construct a potential via , for example , fiedeldey s inverse scattering procedure @xcite , the resulting form factor of the separable potential is not that simple .",
    "the problem becomes even more complicated due to the multichannel character of the @xmath2 interaction with the additional off - shell uncertainties stemming from the @xmath9-meson channel .",
    "in such a situation , it is desirable to narrow as much as possible the uncertainty intervals for the parameters of @xmath2 interaction .",
    "this could be done by demanding consistency of theoretical predictions based on these parameters , with existing experimental data for two- , three- , and four - body @xmath0-nucleus processes .",
    "this is one of the objectives of the present work .",
    "to do this , we calculate the cross sections of coherent @xmath0-photoproduction on @xmath1he and @xmath1h nuclei and study their sensitivity to the parameters of @xmath2 amplitude .",
    "we start by assuming that the compton scattering on a nucleon , @xmath20 as well as the processes of multiple re - appearing of the photon in the intermediate states , @xmath21 give a negligible contribution to the coherent @xmath0-photoproduction on a nucleus @xmath22 .",
    "then the process @xmath23 can be formally described in two steps : at the first step , the photon produces the @xmath0 meson on one of the nucleons , @xmath24 and at the second step ( final state interaction ) , the @xmath0 meson is elastically scattered off the nucleus , @xmath25 an adequate treatment of the scattering step is , of course , the most difficult and crucial part of the theory . among the few - body systems",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath0@xmath12h , @xmath0@xmath12he , and @xmath0@xmath13he , so far only the simplest three - body one ( @xmath11 ) was considered in the framework of exact faddeev - type ags equations .",
    "the first microscopic calculations concerning the low - energy scattering of @xmath0-meson from @xmath12h , @xmath12he , and @xmath13he nuclei were done in refs .",
    "@xcite where the few - body dynamics of these systems were treated by employing the finite - rank approximation ( fra ) @xcite of the nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "this approximation consists in neglecting the continuous spectrum in the spectral expansion @xmath26 of the hamiltonian @xmath27 describing the nucleus .",
    "since the three- and four - body nuclei have only one bound state , fra reduces to @xmath28 physically , this means that we exclude the virtual excitations of the nucleus during its interaction with the @xmath0 meson .",
    "it is clear that the stronger the nucleus is bound , the smaller is the contribution from such processes to the elastic @xmath19 scattering . by comparing with the results of the exact ags calculations , it was shown@xcite that even for @xmath11 scattering , having the weakest nuclear binding , the fra method works reasonably well , which implies that we obtain sufficiently accurate results by applying this method to the @xmath0@xmath12h , @xmath0@xmath12he , and even more so to the @xmath0@xmath13he scattering .",
    "in essence , the fra method can be described as follows ( for details see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath29 be the total @xmath19 hamiltonian , where @xmath30 describes free @xmath0-nucleus motion and @xmath31 the sum of the two - body @xmath0-nucleon potentials .",
    "the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath32 for the @xmath0-nucleus @xmath3-matrix can be rewritten as @xmath33 where @xmath34 and the auxiliary operator @xmath35 is split into @xmath22 components of faddeev - type , @xmath36 satisfying the following system of equations @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the two - body @xmath3-matrix describing the interaction of the @xmath0-meson with the @xmath39-th nucleon , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath40 it should be emphasized that up to this point no approximation has been used yet and therefore the set of equations ( [ teq]-[tetani ] ) is equivalent to the initial equation  ( [ lsinitial ] ) .",
    "however , to solve eq .",
    "( [ teq ] ) , we have to resort to the approximation ( [ fraapprox ] ) which simplifies its kernel ( [ kernel ] ) to @xmath41 with this approximation , the sandwiching of eq .",
    "( [ teq ] ) between @xmath42 and @xmath43 and the partial wave decomposition give a one - dimensional integral equation for the amplitude of the process ( [ etaaaeta ] ) .",
    "the question then arises on how can a photon be included into this formalism in order to describe the photoproduction process ( [ gaaeta ] ) .",
    "this can be achieved by following the same procedure as in ref.@xcite where the reaction ( [ gaaeta ] ) with @xmath44 was treated within the framework of the exact ags equations , and the photon was introduced by considering the @xmath2 and @xmath45 states as two different channels of the same system .",
    "this implies that the operators @xmath38 should be replaced by @xmath46 matrices .",
    "it is clear , that such replacements of the kernels of the integral equations  ( [ t0i ] ) and subsequently of the integral equation ( [ teq ] ) lead to solutions having a similar matrix form @xmath47 here @xmath48 describes the compton scattering , @xmath49 the photoproduction process , and @xmath50 the elastic @xmath0 scattering on the @xmath39-th nucleon .",
    "what is finally needed is the cross section @xmath51 of the reaction ( [ gaaeta ] ) , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the momenta of the photon and @xmath0 meson , @xmath54 is the energy of the photon , @xmath55 the mass of the nucleus , and @xmath56 the reduced mass of the meson and the nucleus .",
    "however , it is technically more convenient to consider the @xmath0-photoabsorption , _ i.e. _ the inverse reaction",
    ". then the photoproduction cross section can be obtained by applying the detailed balance principle .",
    "the reason for this is that all the processes in which the photon appears more than once , _",
    "i.e. _ the terms of the integral equations of type @xmath57 or @xmath58 involving more than one electromagnetic vertex , can be neglected .",
    "omission of these terms in ( [ teq ] ) results in decoupling the elastic scattering equation @xmath59 from the equation for the photoabsorption @xmath60 once the @xmath61 is calculated , the photoabsorption @xmath3-matrix ( [ absorption ] ) can be obtained by integration .",
    "therefore , the procedure of calculating the photoproduction cross section ( [ sechenie ] ) consists of the following steps :    * solving the system of equations @xmath62 for the auxiliary elastic - scattering operators @xmath63  . *",
    "calculating ( by integration ) the auxiliary matrices @xmath64 from @xmath65 * solving the integral equation @xmath66 for the elastic - scattering @xmath3-matrix . * calculating ( by integration ) the photoabsorption @xmath3-matrix @xmath67 * substituting this @xmath3-matrix into eq .",
    "( [ sechenie ] ) to obtain the differential cross section for the photoproduction .",
    "this is possible because the absolute values of the photoproduction and photoabsorption @xmath3-matrices coincide .",
    "to implement the calculation steps described in the previous section , we need the two - body @xmath3-matrices @xmath68 and @xmath69 for the elastic @xmath2 scattering and the photoabsorption @xmath70 on a single nucleon respectively .",
    "furthermore , all equations ( [ proc1]-[proc4 ] ) have to be sandwiched between @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( ground state wave function of the nucleus ) . since at low energies both the elastic scattering and photoproduction of @xmath0 meson on a nucleon",
    "proceed mainly via formation of the @xmath6 resonance , we may retain only the @xmath71-waves in the partial wave expansions of the corresponding two - body @xmath3-matrices .",
    "the problem of constructing an @xmath2 potential or directly the corresponding @xmath3-matrix @xmath68 has no unique solution since the only experimental information available consists of the @xmath6-resonance pole position @xmath72 and the @xmath2 scattering length @xmath73 . in the present work ,",
    "we use three different versions of @xmath68 .      with the absence of any scattering data it is practically impossible to construct a reliable @xmath2 potential .",
    "however , we can make use of the fact that the @xmath6-resonance is the dominant feature of the @xmath2 interaction in the low - energy region , where the elastic scattering can be viewed as the process of formation and subsequent decay of this resonance , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath74 this implies that in this region the corresponding breit - wigner formula could be a good approximation for the @xmath2 cross section .",
    "therefore , we may adopt the following ansatz @xmath75 where the propagator @xmath76 describing the intermediate state of the process ( [ diagram ] ) , is assumed to have a simple breit - wigner form @xmath77 which guaranties that the @xmath3-matrix ( [ tetan ] ) has a pole at the proper place .",
    "the vertex function @xmath78 for the processes @xmath5@xmath79 is chosen to be @xmath80 which in configuration space is of yukawa - type .",
    "the range parameter @xmath81@xmath82 was determined in ref .",
    "@xcite while the parameters of the @xmath6-resonance @xmath83 are taken from ref .",
    "the strength parameter @xmath84 is chosen to reproduce the @xmath0-nucleon scattering length @xmath73 , @xmath85 the imaginary part of which accounts for the flux losses into the @xmath86 channel .",
    "here @xmath87 is the @xmath2 reduced mass .",
    "the two - body scattering length @xmath73 is not accurately known .",
    "different analyses  @xcite provided values for @xmath73 in the range @xmath88 in most recent publications , the value used for i m @xmath73 is around @xmath89fm . however , for re@xmath73 the estimates are still very different ( compare , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite ) . in the present work",
    "we assume that @xmath90 the @xmath3-matrix @xmath68 constructed in this way , reproduces the scattering length ( [ etanlength ] ) and the @xmath6 pole , but apparently violates the two - body unitarity since it does not obey the two - body lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "an alternative way of constructing the two - body @xmath3-matrix @xmath68 is to solve the corresponding lippmann - schwinger equation with an appropriate separable potential having the same form - factors ( [ ffactor ] ) .",
    "however , a one - term separable @xmath3-matrix obtained in this way , does not have a pole at @xmath91 . to recover the resonance behavior in this case",
    ", we use the trick suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely , we use an energy - dependent strength of the potential @xmath92 \\ , g(k')\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is complex while @xmath94 and @xmath95 are real constants . with this ansatz for the potential",
    ", the lippmann - schwinger equation gives the @xmath3-matrix in the form  ( [ tetan ] ) with @xmath96 / ( 1 - i\\sqrt{2 z \\mu_{\\eta n } } /\\alpha)^2}\\ .",
    "\\label{tdeloff}\\ ] ] the constants @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 can be chosen in such a way that the corresponding scattering amplitude reproduces the scattering length @xmath73 and has a pole at @xmath91 .",
    "this version of @xmath68 also reproduces the scattering length ( [ etanlength ] ) and the @xmath6 pole .",
    "moreover , it is consistent with the condition of the two - body unitarity .",
    "we can also construct the @xmath68 having the same form as version i , namely ( [ tetan ] ) , with the same @xmath76 as in ( [ tau1 ] ) but obeying the unitarity condition @xmath97 of course , with the simple form ( [ tetan ] ) , we can not satisfy the condition ( [ unitarity ] ) at all energies . to simplify the derivations ,",
    "we impose this condition on @xmath68 at @xmath98 . since eq .",
    "( [ unitarity ] ) is real , it can fix only one parameter and we need one more condition to fix both the real and imaginary parts of the complex @xmath84 .",
    "as the second equation , we used the imaginary part of eq .",
    "( [ t000 ] ) with @xmath73 given by ( [ etanlength ] ) .",
    "this procedure guaranties the two - body unitarity and gives the correct position of the resonance pole , but the resulting @xmath68 gives @xmath73 which , of course , is different from the value ( [ etanlength ] ) , namely , it gives @xmath99    in what follows we use the three versions of the matrix @xmath68 described above .",
    "all of them have the same separable form ( [ tetan ] ) but different @xmath76 .",
    "a comparison of the results obtained with these three @xmath3-matrices can give us an indication of the importance of the two - body unitarity in the photoproduction processes .      in constructing the photoabsorption @xmath3-matrix @xmath69 , the @xmath6 dominance in the near - threshold region also plays an important role .",
    "it was experimentally shown  @xcite that , at low energies , the reaction ( [ gnneta ] ) proceeds mainly via formation of the @xmath6-resonance , _ i.e. _ @xmath100 this implies that @xmath101 in this energy region can be written in a separable form similarly to ( [ tetan ] ) .",
    "to construct such a separable @xmath3-matrix , we use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite where the @xmath102 was considered as an element of a multi - channel @xmath3-matrix which simultaneously describes experimental data for the processes @xmath103 on the energy shell in the @xmath6-channel . in the present work ,",
    "we take the @xmath3-matrix @xmath104 from ref .",
    "@xcite and extend it off the energy shell via @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a parameter .",
    "the yamaguchi form - factors used in this ansatz , go to unity on the energy shell . since @xmath106 is not known , this parameter is varied in our calculations within a reasonable interval @xmath107 which is a typical range for meson - nucleon forces .",
    "it is known that @xmath102 is different for neutron and proton . in this work",
    "we assume that they have the same functional form ( [ toff ] ) and differ by a constant factor , @xmath108 multipole analysis  @xcite gives for this factor the estimate @xmath109 .      since the @xmath3-matrices @xmath68 and @xmath69 are poorly known and their uncertainties significantly limit the overall accuracy of the theory , it is not necessary to use any sophisticated ( `` realistic '' ) potential to describe the @xmath18 interaction .",
    "therefore we may safely assume that the nucleons interact with each other only in the @xmath71-wave state .    to obtain the necessary nuclear wave function @xmath110",
    ", we solve the few - body equations of the integro - differential equation approach ( idea )  @xcite with the malfliet - tjon potential  @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the hyperspherical harmonic expansion method applied to faddeev - type equations .",
    "in fact , in the case of @xmath71-wave potentials , the idea is fully equivalent to the exact faddeev equations .",
    "therefore , the bound states used in our calculations , are derived , to all practical purposes , via an exact formalism .",
    "figures 1 - 5 show the results of our calculations for the total cross section @xmath111 of the coherent process ( [ gaaeta ] ) .",
    "the calculations were done for two nuclear targets , @xmath1h and @xmath1he , using the three versions of @xmath68 described in the previous section .",
    "the curves corresponding to these three @xmath3-matrices are denoted by ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) , respectively .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "1 , the two versions of @xmath68 , ( i ) and ( ii ) , give significantly different results despite the fact that both of them reproduce the same @xmath73 and the @xmath6-resonance .",
    "this indicates that the scattering of the @xmath0 meson on the nucleons ( final state interaction ) is very important in the description of the photoproduction process .",
    "this conclusion is further substantiated when our curves are compared to the corresponding points ( triangles ) calculated for the @xmath1he target in ref .",
    "@xcite where the final state interaction was treated using an optical potential of the first order .",
    "it is well - known that the first - order optical theory is not adequate at the energies near resonances .",
    "this is the reason why the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite underestimate @xmath112 near the threshold where with @xmath113 the systems @xmath0@xmath12h and @xmath0@xmath12he have resonances @xcite .    a significant differences between the corresponding curves ( i ) and ( ii ) in fig . 1",
    "imply that two - body unitarity is important as well . to clarify this statement",
    ", we compare in fig .",
    "2 the results corresponding to the three choices of @xmath76 in ( [ tetan ] ) .",
    "surprisingly , the curves ( ii ) and ( iii ) almost coincide despite the fact that they correspond to different @xmath73 while both obey the two - body unitarity condition .",
    "the last three figures , figs . 3 , 4 and 5 , show the dependence of the results on the choices of the parameters @xmath106 and @xmath114 .",
    "since nothing is known about @xmath106 , we assume @xmath115 as the basic value for it .",
    "this can be motivated by the fact that both the elastic scattering and photoabsorption ( production ) of the @xmath0 meson on the nucleon go via formation of the same @xmath6 resonance .",
    "this means that at least one vertex , namely , @xmath116 should be the same for both the elastic scattering and photoabsorption . to find out how crucial the choice of @xmath106 is , we did two additional calculations with @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( see fig .",
    "we see that even with this wide variation the curves are not far from each other especially in the immediate vicinity of the threshold energy .",
    "therefore the dependence on @xmath106 is not very strong and the choice @xmath115 can give us a reasonable estimate for the photoproduction cross section .",
    "3 also shows an interesting tendency of increasing @xmath112 when the range of the interaction becomes smaller ( when @xmath106 grows ) .    figs .",
    "4 and 5 for the @xmath1h and @xmath1he targets , respectively , show the dependence of @xmath112 on the choice of the parameter @xmath22 .",
    "an interesting observation here is that the cross section for @xmath0 photoproduction is more sensitive to this parameter with the tritium rather than the @xmath1he target .",
    "this means that between these two nuclei , the tritium is a preferable candidate for a possible experimental determination of the ratio @xmath22 .",
    "the cusp exhibited by all the curves at the threshold of total nuclear break - up , reflects losses of the flux into the non - coherent channel . in a sense",
    ", this is a reflection of the four - body unitarity which the fra equations are consistent with .",
