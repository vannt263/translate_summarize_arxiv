    "<S> we discuss a numerical method to study electron transport in mesoscopic devices out of equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> the method is based on the solution of operator equations of motion , using efficient chebyshev time propagation techniques . </S>",
    "<S> its peculiar feature is the propagation of operators backwards in time . in this way </S>",
    "<S> the resource consumption scales linearly with the number of states used to represent the system . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to calculate the current for non - interacting electrons in large one- , two- and three - dimensional lead - device configurations with time - dependent voltages or potentials . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the technical aspects of the method and present results for an electron pump device and a disordered system , where we find transient behaviour that exists for a very long time and may be accessible to experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> electron transport through mesoscopic devices contacted to leads is intensely studied in chemistry and physics ( see e.g. refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the conceptual basis for theoretical studies is the non - equilibrium green function ( keldysh ) formalism  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the meir - wingreen - formula  @xcite allows for the calculation of steady state currents . for time - dependent potentials or gate voltages the calculation of </S>",
    "<S> a current is a serious problem already for non - interacting electrons . </S>",
    "<S> one crucial point in most approaches is that the resource consumption scales quadratically with the number of system sites , since each green function @xmath0 or operator product @xmath1 has two site indices . </S>",
    "<S> the necessity to study large systems conflicts with the rapid growth of computational demands , especially if long leads with long recurrence time are required . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies therefore addressed mainly one - dimensional ( 1d ) situations , e.g. by time - propagation of operator expectation values or of several single - particle eigenstates  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in the present contribution we numerically solve the equation of motion for a single fermion operator . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous studies , the initial time coordinate is propagated backwards in time . </S>",
    "<S> then the computational effort , in particular the memory consumption , scales linearly with the number of lattice sites used to represent device and leads . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to calculate the non - equilibrium current even for large systems that could not be treated otherwise .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the following situation : a device of @xmath2-sites is contacted to two long leads extending along the @xmath3-direction ( see figure  [ slab ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this slab geometry includes the 2d ( @xmath4 ) and 1d ( @xmath5 ) case . for the kinetic energy in the hamiltonian @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> we assume nearest - neighbour hopping ( @xmath7 ) along each axis @xmath8 , and set @xmath9 as the unit of energy . </S>",
    "<S> the potential energy terms describe the voltage bias @xmath10 applied between the left / right lead , and the local potentials @xmath11 in the device . the current along a bond in the @xmath3-direction is given by the expectation value of the corresponding operator @xmath12    typical 2d slab geometry , with a central device region contacted to a left / right lead.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to specify the initial conditions , we assume that for times @xmath13 the device is isolated and uncharged , and the leads are in equilibrium at zero temperature ( this situation can be described by setting @xmath14 along the contacts at @xmath15 and letting @xmath16 in @xmath17 ) . at time @xmath18 device and leads are brought into contact , and electrons can flow onto the device . </S>",
    "<S> we then ask for the current @xmath19 through a section @xmath20 of the slab .    </S>",
    "<S> time propagation of the many - fermion fock state @xmath21 is not feasible , and the reduction of this problem to the propagation of several single - fermion states is restricted to non - interacting electrons and introduces additional errors that must be controlled . </S>",
    "<S> it appears to be more natural to propagate the current operators themselves . with the time evolution operator @xmath22 , defined by @xmath23 , @xmath24 , </S>",
    "<S> operators can be transformed to the heisenberg picture @xmath25 and expectation values are obtained from @xmath26 and the initial state @xmath27 as @xmath28 therefore we must represent @xmath26 in terms of operators @xmath29 at time @xmath18 , @xmath30 which allows evaluation of equation   since all initial expectation values @xmath31 are known .    </S>",
    "<S> we observe that two ways exist to obtain @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the standard way starts from @xmath32 \\ , \\hat{u}(t,0 ) = [ a , h(t)]^h(t,0 ) \\;.\\ ] ] in this equation , the commutator is given as a combination of operators @xmath33 , which is evaluated at time @xmath34 in the heisenberg picture . </S>",
    "<S> therefore solution of equation   requires time propagation of all operators @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the total number of coefficients in the corresponding expansions equation   for these operators grows quadratically with the number of sites .    to avoid quadratic growth </S>",
    "<S> we here proceed the opposite way , starting from @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the previous case , we do not need to transform the commutator in @xmath37 = [ h(t ' ) , a^h(t , t')]\\ ] ] to the heisenberg picture . </S>",
    "<S> instead , it is only the single operator @xmath38 whose expansion @xmath39    must be propagated in time . </S>",
    "<S> we do not need to keep track of all the other operators @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore memory consumption and computational effort are proportional to the number of sites . making use of @xmath41 , each fermion operator in equation   </S>",
    "<S> can be propagated separately to obtain @xmath42 .    </S>",
    "<S> the price to be paid here is that equation   leads to propagation backwards in time , evolving the second time coordinate from the initial @xmath43 to the final @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the main reason why we nevertheless consider this procedure is that , avoiding quadratic growth of memory consumption , only this way allows for the treatment of large systems , which are inaccessible in the first way . with modern chebyshev techniques  @xcite , time propagation itself is fast and accurate , and the additional effort for backward propagation is compensated by the reduction of the problem size . note that for periodic time dependence , operators can be propagated iteratively by a full period .    turning to the slab geometry , the eigenstates of decoupled infinite leads are discrete along the @xmath45- , @xmath46-direction and continuous along the @xmath3-direction . in the actual calculation , </S>",
    "<S> infinite leads are replaced by long leads of length @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the recurrence time revealing the artificial discretization is of the order @xmath48 , and must be larger than the maximal time @xmath34 in the calculations . using operators @xmath49 for lead eigenstates to energy @xmath50 and operators @xmath51 for device sites </S>",
    "<S> @xmath52 as the @xmath33 in equation   the initial conditions specify the expectation values at time @xmath18 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> note that only these conditions change for finite temperatures .     </S>",
    "<S> ( colour online ) current @xmath55 measured 10 sites to the left ( black curve ) or right ( red curve ) of a 1d pumping device with @xmath56 sites . </S>",
    "<S> the system parameters are @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , with fermi momentum @xmath60 for the leads . </S>",
    "<S> time @xmath34 is given in multiples of the period @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> shown is the net current @xmath62 over one period , in comparison to the situation with a static potential wave ( dashed curves ) . </S>",
    "<S> the insets display @xmath55 over the first and last 5 periods . </S>",
    "<S> , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in our first example in figure  [ pumping ] , a travelling potential wave @xmath63 pumps electrons in a 1d system with zero voltage bias @xmath64 from the left to right ( i.e. along the positive @xmath3-direction ) . in the beginning electrons flow onto the initially uncharged device . </S>",
    "<S> the initial transient behaviour evolves into a ` pseudo ' steady state ( left panel ) , which persists over @xmath65 periods . </S>",
    "<S> the true steady state , with equal current at both sites of the device , is approached only in the extreme long time limit ( right panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> comparison to the case of a static potential , with the same @xmath66 but @xmath67 , shows that the ` pseudo ' steady state persists on much longer time scales than the initial transient behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> this may allow for the experimental observation of deviations from the steady state , which here occur over @xmath68 periods up to the maximal propagation time . to allow for such long propagation time in our calculation , </S>",
    "<S> we choose long leads with @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the full system has @xmath70 sites .    in our second example in figure  [ disorder ] , a constant voltage bias @xmath71 transports electrons through a disordered 3d device , with ( static ) random potentials with uniform probability distribution @xmath72 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> a steady state is approached only for the short system @xmath73 with large bias @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> longer systems ( @xmath75 ) support localized states , whose presence causes oscillations in @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> these become more pronounced for smaller bias @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the net current through the device is close to zero , since localized states do not contribute to transport . </S>",
    "<S> note that the average current for @xmath73 is much smaller for @xmath76 than for @xmath74 , while for the @xmath77 system it is of the same magnitude .     </S>",
    "<S> ( colour online ) current @xmath55 at the contact surface of a disordered 3d device with @xmath78 and different @xmath79 , for @xmath80 and @xmath60 . a static voltage bias @xmath81 , @xmath82 is applied , with @xmath74 ( upper panel ) and @xmath76 ( lower panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inset compares the @xmath73 to the @xmath77 system , and shows the time averaged current ( dashed curve ) in addition . </S>",
    "<S> note that the data are given for a single disorder configuration . </S>",
    "<S> , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in the given examples , up to @xmath83 lattice sites are treated for device and leads . </S>",
    "<S> because of linear scaling in our method we must keep only that many elements in memory , and all calculations can be performed on standard desktop computers . with quadratic scaling , we would have to store about @xmath84 elements , requiring already @xmath85 gbyte for complex numbers in double precision .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , the numerical method discussed here allows for the calculation of time - dependent currents in large systems of non - interacting electrons , which are inaccessible to most other existing techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the propagation of operators backwards in time is a tolerable disadvantage in such cases . </S>",
    "<S> apart from these achievements , the development of advanced solution techniques for complicated non - equilibrium green function equations of motion appears more promising for future progress , especially with respect to the inclusion of dissipation or interaction . </S>",
    "<S> how such developments are possible within the context of the chebyshev space method  @xcite and sparse polynomial space approach  @xcite will be discussed elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> data obtained with the present method serve as a reference to validate these new techniques .    </S>",
