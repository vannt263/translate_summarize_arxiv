    "since its introduction by witten and sander in 1981@xcite , the diffusion - limited aggregation ( dla ) has been one of the most important models of growth processes which are dominated by diffusion process or , in a wider sense , of non - equilibrium and non - linear statistical physics and stochastic processes .",
    "the dynamical rule of this model is very simple : initially a seed particle is placed at the center .",
    "a random walker is released far from the cluster and when once it touches the cluster , it stops walking and becomes a part of the cluster .",
    "then next walker is released , @xmath0 .",
    "the process repeats again and again .",
    "the cluster grown under the above - described process forms a fractal structure having several , typically five for a two - dimensional cluster , main branches and each branch has many subbranches hierarchically .",
    "growth patterns like this have been observed for many kinds of experiments : electrodeposition@xcite , viscous fingering@xcite , crystal growth with its anisotropy suppressed@xcite , bacteria colony growth@xcite , and so forth .",
    "these experiments , computer simulations , and theoretical studies have clearified the properties of the dla , but some fundamental problems to be understood remain .",
    "about fifteen years ago , a novel approach was proposed@xcite for two - dimensional dla .",
    "this approach utilizes iterative conformal map , which automatically satisfies the laplace equation , since the dla is dominated by the field which satisfies it .",
    "this approach has led to many interesting results : for example , scaling laws associated with the laurent expansion of the map@xcite , higher precision multifractal analysis @xcite , and the role of randomness@xcite .",
    "it is well known that a flat interface becomes unstable in a diffusion - dominated growth process@xcite .",
    "the instability is suppressed within a certain length scale by the surface tension effect which stabilizes the flat interface @xcite .",
    "therefore the incorporation of this effect is important for considering the validity of a model being compared with experimental results and the relation between the randomness of a growth rule and regular growth patterns .",
    "there have been some attempts to incorporate the effect into the original form of the dla , by introducing a sticking probability dependent on the curvature of the growth point @xcite and more ingeniously , by reconstructing the interface by random walks between two points on the surface@xcite .    in the present article",
    "we present how to incorporate the surface tension effect into an iterative conformal mapping approach .",
    "we follow the idea of a probability dependent on the local curvature at the growth point@xcite .",
    "the curvature is calculated by utilizing the properties of the conformal map .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 , we describe the model .",
    "we briefly review the iterative conformal mapping approach .",
    "and then we introduce a probability with curvature dependence and present how to calculate the curvature .",
    "the patterns formed by this model are shown and qualitatively discussed in sec .",
    "a scaling analysis is given in sec .",
    "is dedicated to the summary .",
    "let @xmath1 be the conformal map which maps the external region of the unit circle @xmath2 in the complex plane @xmath3 onto the external region of the two - dimensional @xmath4particle cluster in the physical space .",
    "the image of the unit circle under @xmath1 is the interface of the cluster .",
    "first let @xmath5 be the elementary map which makes a semicircular `` bump '' of size @xmath6 at around @xmath7 on the unit circle@xcite : @xmath8 - 1\\right\\}^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then @xmath1 is constructed by iteration of the elementary maps : @xmath9 note the order of the composition .",
    "the angle at which the @xmath10-th bump is generated , @xmath11 , is an independent stochastic variable obeying the uniform distribution on @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "the bump size parameter @xmath13 is chosen as @xmath14 in order to fix the bump size in the physical plane , to the first order , where @xmath15 is a typical bump area and is specified in advance .    in fig.[dla ] a typical cluster of 10000 bumps and @xmath16 constructed by the above approach is shown .      in order to incorporate the surface tension effect into the conformal mapping model",
    ", we introduce the growth probability @xmath17 that the next ( ( @xmath18)-th ) bump is generated at around @xmath19 .",
    "the probability @xmath17 depends on the curvature at @xmath20 and is written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are positive constants and @xmath24 is the curvature at @xmath20 . since @xmath17 is defined as a probability , if @xmath25 we set @xmath26 .",
    "also , if @xmath27 we set @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a small positive constant , in order to keep the process going on and save the calculation time .",
    "it is necessary for @xmath29 to be smaller for larger @xmath22 in order to suppress the effect of randomness which allows more growth at a point with larger curvature .",
    "the introduction of the `` sticking '' probability , eq.([prob ] ) , that a random walker released far from the cluster sticks to a given point , to incorporate the surface tension effect , was presented in on - lattice@xcite and off - lattice@xcite simulations for diffusion - limited growth process .",
    "subsequently , it was shown@xcite that the evaluation of the surface tension effect could be better by reconstructing the interface by considering a random walk between two points on the interface .",
    "this method was used in simulations of viscous fingering on a lattice@xcite .",
    "it was pointed out@xcite that there is a correspondence between these two methods when we consider the short - time behavior of the interface not so far from flatness .    in order to obtain the curvature at a point , we utilize the fact that the conformal map @xmath30 has branch points associated with the generations of bumps@xcite . each branch point has a preimage @xmath31 $ ] on the unit circle .",
    "the argument of the preimage is characterized by three integer indices , @xmath32 , @xmath10 , and @xmath33 .",
    "the subscript @xmath32 is the step when the branch point was generated ( _ i.e. _ the @xmath32-th bump was generated ) .",
    "the subscript @xmath10 is the step at which the analysis is being done .",
    "the superscript @xmath33 is the order of the branch point along the arc length , emphasizing that it is a function of the step @xmath10 .",
    "consider the list of the arguments of the preimages at the @xmath10-th step , @xmath34 .",
    "for each step , the preimages move on the unit circle in the mathematical space keeping their physical positions fixed .",
    "when bumps overlap , some branch points are covered and their arguments are omitted from the list .",
    "assume that the list at @xmath35-th step @xmath36 is available . at the @xmath10-th step , the elementary map associated with the @xmath10-th bump @xmath37 has two branch points at @xmath38 = \\phi_{\\theta_n,\\lambda_n}(\\exp[i \\beta^{\\pm}_{n , n}]),\\ ] ] where @xmath39,\\ ] ] in order to keep the asymptotic form @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "on the unit circle , the domain @xmath42 $ ] is covered by the bump .",
    "if an element of the list is in this domain , it does not join the list at the next step .",
    "therefore the list at the @xmath10-th step @xmath34 consists of the new elements @xmath43 and the elements of the list at the previous step , which are not omitted by the new bump and are updated as @xmath44 =   \\phi_{\\theta_n,\\lambda_n}^{-1}(\\exp[i \\beta^{j(n-1)}_{k , n-1}]),\\ ] ] where @xmath45 denotes the inverse function of @xmath37 .",
    "note that the order index @xmath46 is not simply related to @xmath47 .",
    "each branch point @xmath48 at the @xmath10-th step is given as @xmath49 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\phi^{(k ) } ( \\exp[i\\beta^{\\tilde{j}(n)}_{k , k } ] ) , \\label{mapping}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 $ ] and @xmath51 $ ] are related as @xmath52   = \\phi_{\\theta_n,\\lambda_n}^{-1 } \\circ \\cdots \\circ\\phi_{\\theta_{k+1},\\lambda_{k+1}}^{-1 } ( \\exp[i\\beta^{\\tilde{j}(n)}_{k , k}]).\\ ] ] numerically the second - line representation of eq.([mapping ] ) gives a much more precise result than the first .",
    "we can draw the outline of the cluster by connecting the images of the branch points .",
    "assume that @xmath53 is a candidate position of the @xmath18-th bump which is between the @xmath54- and @xmath55-th branch points .",
    "let @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath56 be the midpoints between the @xmath57- and @xmath54-th , @xmath54- and @xmath55-th , and @xmath55- and @xmath58-th branch points , respectively . then the curvature radius @xmath59 is given as the radius of the circumcircle of @xmath60 ( see fig.[curvature ] ) .",
    "let @xmath61 be the angle pointing to the external region . if @xmath62 , the curvature is positive and if @xmath63 it is negative .",
    "the validity of this definition of the curvature will be examined in the next section .    for this model",
    ", it is known that sometimes a large flat bump is generated which seals a `` fjord '' of the cluster@xcite . in order to prevent a flat bump from being generated ,",
    "we restrict the number of branch points , @xmath64 , covered by a bump . however , too small @xmath64 makes it impossible for a bump to be generated at a point of negative curvature , since branch points are concentrated around such point .",
    "hereinafter , we set @xmath65 .",
    "figs . [ plots](a)-(d ) show typical patterns for several values of @xmath22 .",
    "values @xmath66 , @xmath16 and @xmath67 are common to all the calculations .",
    "the dependence on @xmath23 is very weak .",
    "the appropriate value of @xmath29 depends on @xmath22 , since it should be chosen in order not to affect the results .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 corresponds to the strength of the surface tension effect .",
    "therefore , with increasing @xmath22 , the structure of the cluster becomes more coarse and compact and the cluster has fatter branches .",
    "we can also observe the above - described crossover of the pattern by changing the size of the cluster while keeping @xmath22 fixed , since the surface tension is effective within a certain finite length scale .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig.[growth ] , where @xmath68 , @xmath66 , @xmath69 , and interfaces are plotted every 750 steps .",
    "we can observe that an initially two - dimensional compact cluster becomes fractal through tip - splitting .    in order for our definition of curvature to be valid",
    ", the curvature radius @xmath59 should be sufficiently larger than the distance between branch points .",
    "5 shows the distribution of the curvature of the point at which a bump is generated for several values of @xmath22 until @xmath67 .",
    "a dependence of the distribution on step @xmath10 is not observed .",
    "it is easily confirmed that the greater @xmath22 becomes , the more suppressed the growth at a point with large curvature is .",
    "the characteristic distance between branch points is evaluated by the typical size of bump , @xmath70 .",
    "thus it is necessary that a growth at a point with curvature larger than @xmath71 should not be allowed . from fig.[crvdist ] , it is concluded that for @xmath72 , our definition of curvature is valid .",
    "in this model , some quantities can be evaluated from the conformal map .",
    "the area of the cluster @xmath73 is evaluated by the number of the bumps ( steps ) @xmath74 , since the size of the bump is kept fixed to the first order ( see eq.([bumpsize ] ) ) .",

    "we expect that the scaling relations shown below hold for these quantities : @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are scaling exponents .    figs.[scaling ] ( a ) and ( b ) show the plot of @xmath78 vs. @xmath73 and @xmath78 vs. @xmath75 , respectively for @xmath86 , averaged over 20 samples . for @xmath87 ,",
    "the growth is fractal , with the exponents @xmath88 . in this regime @xmath89 and @xmath85",

    "our result @xmath90 agrees with the result for the original dla@xcite . for @xmath91 ,",
    "the growth is compact , @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( see fig.[growth ] ) .",
    "if a larger @xmath22 is used and an average over more samples are taken , @xmath94 becomes larger and the compact growth is expected to be observed more clearly .",
    "we presented a method for incorporating the surface tension effect into an iterative conformal mapping model of the dla . in our method ,",
    "a generation of a bump depends on the curvature of the candidate point where this curvature is obtained by utilizing the branch points of a conformal map .",
