    "one of the fundamental issues which triggered , and has influenced since , heavy ion physics is the question of the phase structure and the thermodynamic properties of strongly interacting matter at energy densities above 1gev/@xmath0 . under such conditions , exceeding the energy density in nuclei but still far away from the asymptotic regime , the coupling strength @xmath1 is large , which makes the theoretical description of the many - body problem challenging .    in the",
    "recent past the understanding of this field has become much more detailed . the phase diagram for qcd with @xmath2 massless flavors , which is the case we will consider in the following ,",
    "can be briefly described as follows ( we refer to @xcite for a recent review ) . at zero quark",
    "chemical potential , @xmath3 , the broken chiral symmetry of hadron matter is restored within the quark - gluon plasma , at a critical temperature @xmath4mev .",
    "it is thought that this second order transition persists also for nonzero @xmath5 , thus defining a critical line , which changes to a first order transition line at the tricritical point . for small temperatures and @xmath6",
    "one anticipates a color - superconducting phase of quark matter .",
    "the value of @xmath7 is expected to be 100 ... 200mev larger than the quark chemical potential @xmath8mev in nuclear matter .",
    "quantitative results for large @xmath1 can be obtained from first principles by lattice calculations which were , however , restricted to nonzero temperature and @xmath3 until very recently .",
    "therefore , the described picture for @xmath9 is mainly based on general arguments combined with results from various models , including extrapolations of perturbative qcd .    as a phenomenological description of the thermodynamics of deconfined",
    "strongly interacting matter we proposed a quasiparticle model @xcite .",
    "its parameters are fixed by the lattice data at @xmath3 .",
    "we then use the fact that within the model the thermodynamic potentials at zero chemical potential and @xmath9 are related by thermodynamic consistency . in @xcite",
    "we analyzed lattice data for @xmath10 flavors @xcite , and @xmath11 @xcite , which were , however , still derogated by sizable lattice artifacts which have an effect on the absolute scaling of the data .",
    "we therefore introduced a constant effective number of degrees of freedom of the quasiparticles as an additional model parameter to obtain first qualitative estimates .",
    "later we considered in @xcite the lattice data @xcite , where also the physical case of ( 2 + 1 ) flavors was simulated .",
    "as the absolute scaling of the lattice data enters as important information in particular near @xmath12 , we pragmatically applied the continuum extrapolation of the data , which was proposed in @xcite for @xmath13 , also for smaller temperatures .",
    "the results of this prescription can now be compared to new lattice data @xcite . meanwhile , there are other lattice calculations which allow us to test directly the assumptions underlying the quasiparticle model as well as , for the first time , some of its predictions for nonzero chemical potential .",
    "we will therefore consider here the presently available lattice data for @xmath10 . based on that , we will fit and discuss the quasiparticle parameters at @xmath14 in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we will briefly summarize how to extend the model to nonzero chemical potential , and compare our findings with the results @xcite from lattice simulations studying the region of small @xmath5 .",
    "section 5 concludes with the discussion of some physical implications .",
    "the simulations @xcite are performed on lattices with spatial extent @xmath15 and temporal sizes @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with an improved wilson quark action and renormalized quark masses corresponding to fixed ratios @xmath18 of the pseudoscalar to vector meson masses .",
    "we first consider the data for two light flavors , corresponding to @xmath19 .",
    "although this is larger than the physical value , the results are almost insensitive to the ratio , which suggests that they are not too far from the chiral limit .",
    "as expected for the rather small lattice sizes , the results for @xmath20 and 6 differ . however , we observe that normalizing the pressure data by @xmath21 , the ratio of the free limits in the continuum and on the lattice , improves considerably the consistency between the data sets . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the normalized @xmath20 data are in agreement with the normalized @xmath22 data after rescaling by a constant of @xmath23 .",
    "this simple scaling behavior for large coupling is rather remarkable .",
    "based on this observation we suggest the continuum estimate for the pressure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : latt dat p ] .     lattice data for the pressure in units of the free pressure @xmath24 . shown are the scaled ( see text ) data @xcite for light quarks corresponding to meson mass ratios of @xmath25 ( open circles : @xmath20 ; open squares : @xmath22 ) , and the continuum estimate @xcite ( grey band ) .",
    "the full line is the quasiparticle result .",
    "the full symbols represent the data @xcite for large quark masses , with @xmath26 . for comparison ,",
    "the hatched band shows the su(3 ) lattice data ( dotted line : @xcite ; dashed line : @xcite ) normalized to the corresponding free pressure .",
    "[ fig : latt dat p ] ]    we assume here that the normalized @xmath22 data are already close to the continuum limit .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the thus interpreted data match the aforementioned continuum estimate from the staggered quark simulations @xcite was assumed , corresponding to @xmath27 at @xmath12 . from the weak quark mass sensitivity observed in @xcite",
    ", both results should indeed be comparable . ] .",
    "therefore , a consistent picture forms for the thermodynamics of qcd with @xmath2 light flavors .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : latt dat s ] , the corresponding data for the entropy are shown .",
    "it is noted that since the slope of the continuum extrapolated pressure @xcite is slightly larger than that from the data @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : latt dat p ] ) , the upper part of the error band is already for @xmath28 very close to the free limit .",
    "this would be in contrast to the pure gauge case , where the uncertainty due to lattice artifacts has become small , so we will assume that the lower side of this estimate is more relevant .    , and the quasiparticle fit .",
    "[ fig : latt dat s ] ]",
    "for completeness , we briefly recall here the main ideas of the quasiparticle model @xcite of the qcd plasma .    for weak coupling @xmath29 ,",
    "the thermodynamic behavior of the system is dominated by its excitations with momenta @xmath30 .",
    "while hard collective modes ( the longitudinal plasmon and the quark hole excitation ) are exponentially suppressed , the transverse gluons and the quark particle excitations propagate predominantly on simple mass shells , @xmath31 @xcite . in the chiral limit",
    "the so - called asymptotic masses are given by @xmath32 g^2 \\ , ,    \\nonumber \\\\",
    "m_q^2    & = &    \\frac{n_c^2 - 1}{8n_c}\\ , \\left [ t^2+\\frac{\\mu_q^2}{\\pi^2 } \\right ] g^2 \\ , ,   \\label{m2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 denotes the quark chemical potential , and @xmath34 .",
    "interpreting the relevant excitations as quasiparticles , the thermodynamic potential is p(t , ) = _ i p_i(t , _ i ( ) ; m_i^2 ) - b(m_j^2 ) , [ p_eff ] where @xmath35 are the contributions of the gluons ( with vanishing chemical potential ) and the quarks ( for the antiquarks , the chemical potential differs in the sign ) , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 count the degrees of freedom .",
    "as shown in @xcite , thermodynamic consistency requires the derivative , with respect to the @xmath38 , of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ p_eff ] ) to vanish , i.e. , the contribution @xmath39 is related to the @xmath40 and @xmath5 dependent masses by = .",
    "[ b ] this implies that the entropy and the particle densities are simply given by the sum of the individual quasiparticle contributions , s_i = .",
    "|_m_i^2 , n_i = .",
    "|_m_i^2 , [ s , n ] while the energy density has the form @xmath41 .    expanded in the coupling @xmath29 , the above approach reproduces the leading - order perturbative results .",
    "the full expressions , however , represent a thermodynamically consistent resummation of terms of all orders in @xmath29 .",
    "this suggests pondering the application of the model also in the strong coupling regime .",
    "considering first the case @xmath14 , it indeed turns out that the lattice data for the entropy shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : latt dat s ] can be described by the model with the ansatz _",
    "s(t,=0 ) = [ eq : alpha(t ) ] for @xmath42 .",
    "this is the leading order perturbative result at a momentum scale determined by the temperature : @xmath43 is related to the qcd scale @xmath44 , while @xmath45 parameterizes the behavior in the infrared . for the parameters we obtain = 17.1 , t_s = 0.89 t_c .",
    "the resulting quasiparticle masses are large ; near @xmath12 they reach several times the value of the temperature .",
    "the existence of such heavy excitations , which we have inferred from the thermodynamic bulk properties , has meanwhile been confirmed directly by lattice calculations of the propagators @xcite .",
    "finally , since the derivative of the ` bag ' function @xmath39 is related to the quasiparticle masses by eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) , the model is completely defined by fixing b_0 = b(t_c ) = 1.1 t_c^4 , which enters the fit in fig .",
    "[ fig : latt dat p ] as the third parameter .",
    "since all the information about the coupling is encoded in the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 , it is interesting to look at their flavor dependence . comparing to the pure gauge plasma",
    ", it is recalled that in this case the pressure becomes very small close to the transition since there it has to match the pressure of the heavy glue balls in the confined phase .",
    "similarly , the entropy is small at @xmath47 , which implies a large coupling there . for @xmath10",
    "the scaled entropy for @xmath47 is somewhat larger , thus close to the transition the coupling has to be smaller than for pure su(3 ) .",
    "however , for fixed parameters @xmath46 and @xmath45 , the coupling ( [ eq : alpha(t ) ] ) would increase with increasing number of active flavors .",
    "therefore , a difference of the parameters for @xmath2 to those for the pure gauge plasma @xcite , ^_su(3 ) = 4.9 , t_s^_su(3 ) = 0.73 t_c , is not unexpected .",
    "interestingly , the parameter @xmath45 does not change by much compared to the case of @xmath2 .",
    "the quasiparticle model as applied in the previous section can be generalized to nonzero quark chemical potential @xmath48 .",
    "the quasiparticle masses now depend also on @xmath5  explicitly by the dimensionful coefficients of the coupling in eq .",
    "( [ m2 ] ) , and implicitly by the coupling itself . as shown in @xcite , maxwell s relation , @xmath49 , directly implies a partial differential equation for @xmath50 .",
    "it is of first order and linear in the derivatives of the coupling ( but nonlinear in @xmath1 ) , c_t + c _ = c , [ eq : flow eq ] where the coefficients @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 depend on @xmath40 , @xmath5 and @xmath1 .",
    "it can easily be solved by reduction to a system of coupled ordinary differential equations , = c_t , = c _ , = c , which determines the so - called characteristic curves @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and the evolution of @xmath1 along such a curve , given an initial value .",
    "with regard to the underlying physics it is worth pointing out some properties of the flow equation ( [ eq : flow eq ] ) .",
    "the coefficients are combinations of products of a derivative of the quasiparticle entropy or density with respect to the quasiparticle mass , and a derivative of the quasiparticle mass with respect to @xmath40 , @xmath5 or @xmath1 .",
    "writing down the explicit expressions , it is easy to see that the flow equation is elliptic .",
    "in particular , one finds c_t(t , = 0 ) = 0 , c_(t=0 , ) = 0 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath52 , e.g. , vanishes because not only the entropy goes to zero as @xmath56 , but also its derivative with respect to the mass .",
    "therefore , the characteristics are perpendicular to both the @xmath40 and the @xmath5 axes .",
    "this guarantees that specifying the coupling on some interval on the @xmath40 axis sets up a valid initial condition problem . from the temperature dependence of the effective coupling",
    "as obtained from the lattice data at @xmath57 , e.g.  in the physically motivated parameterization ( [ eq : alpha(t ) ] ) , we can therefore determine numerically the coupling from eq .",
    "( [ eq : flow eq ] ) , and hence the equation of state , in other parts of the @xmath58 plane .",
    "it is instructive to consider the asymptotic limit , @xmath59 , of eq .",
    "( [ eq : flow eq ] ) , where the coefficient @xmath53 vanishes .",
    "then the coupling is constant along the characteristics , which become ellipses in the variables @xmath60 and @xmath61 , leading to the mapping t ( ) ^1/4 .",
    "this holds approximately also for larger coupling , see fig .  [",
    "fig : char ] , so the lattice data at @xmath14 are mapped in elliptic strips into the @xmath58 plane . on the other hand , an ansatz analog to eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha(t ) ] ) to parameterize @xmath62 is quantitatively less satisfactory than in the case @xmath14 .    ) .",
    "the characteristic through @xmath12 coincides for small @xmath5 with the critical line ( dashed , with a hatched error band ) obtained in the lattice calculation @xcite . in the region under the dash - dotted line the resulting quasiparticle pressure is negative  a transition to another phase has to happen somewhere outside .",
    "therefore , the narrow grey region under the @xmath63 line , where the solution of the flow equation is not unique , is physically irrelevant . indicated by the symbol ( assuming , for the scaling , @xmath64mev ) is the chemical potential @xmath65 in nuclear matter . [ fig : char ] ]    a closer look at the characteristics emanating from the interval @xmath66 $ ] reveals that they intersect in a narrow half - crescent region , which indicates that there the solution of the flow equation is not unique .",
    "this , however , is only an ostensible ambiguity .",
    "it so happens that the extrapolation of the pressure becomes negative in a larger region , see figs .",
    "[ fig : char ] and [ fig : p_mut ] .",
    "this implies that a transition to another phase , at a certain positive pressure , happens already outside this region , so the encountered ambiguity of the flow equation is of no physical relevance .",
    ", i.e.  by the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath45 fitted from the entropy , whereas the @xmath63 line depends also on @xmath67 and thus on the third parameter @xmath68 . therefore , the fact that the potential ambiguity is irrelevant is based in a nontrivial way on the underlying lattice data for the equation of state at @xmath14 . ]    at this point we emphasize again that this extrapolation of the quasiparticle model relies only on the requirement of thermodynamic consistency .",
    "of course , it implicitly assumes also that the quasiparticle structure does not change , i.e. , that deconfined quarks and gluons are the relevant degrees of freedom . for small enough @xmath5 and temperatures above ( or near , as @xmath5 gets larger ) @xmath12 this is a justified assumption .",
    "however , the quasiparticle structure will change in the hadronic phase , when both @xmath40 and @xmath5 are small , as well as for sufficiently cold and dense systems where the color - superconducting phase is expected .",
    "although the present quasiparticle model can not make any statements about these phases , it is interesting to observe that it ` anticipates ' the existence of another phase only from the lattice input at @xmath69 and @xmath14 .",
    "an interpretation of the apparent similarity of the line of vanishing pressure in fig .",
    "[ fig : char ] with the expected transition line from the hadron to the superconducting quark matter phase , see ref .",
    "@xcite , remains , of course , a speculation .",
    "there is , however , a related question which we can address with the quasiparticle model without knowing details about the other phases , just based on the fact that for nonzero chemical potential the transition from the deconfined to the confined phase occurs at the critical line @xmath70 .",
    "the critical line is expected to be perpendicular to the @xmath40 axis , which has been confirmed in a recent lattice calculation @xcite where also its curvature at @xmath14 has been calculated , @xmath71 . within the quasiparticle model",
    "it is natural to relate , at least for small @xmath5 , the critical line to the characteristic through @xmath72 , which , as shown above , is also perpendicular to the @xmath40 axis . for small @xmath5 where only the quadratic terms are relevant ( practically even for @xmath5 as large as @xmath73 )",
    ", we indeed find the @xmath12 characteristic in a striking agreement with the critical line from @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : char ] .",
    "another argument supporting the above interpretation of the @xmath12 characteristic comes from considering the case where the quark flavors have opposite chemical potentials , @xmath74 . with this isovector chemical potential",
    "the fermion determinant is positive definite , and standard monte carlo techniques can be applied to study this system on the lattice @xcite .",
    "the lattice result @xcite obtained for the curvature of the critical line in that case agrees with the value quoted above for the isoscalar potential @xmath5 . within the quasiparticle model ,",
    "the equality of these two numbers is immediately evident .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was furthermore mentioned that the quadratic behavior , with the same curvature as at @xmath3 , of the critical line is not likely to extrapolate down to small transition temperatures since @xmath70 would then vanish only at @xmath75mev .",
    "phenomenologically , however , @xmath7 is expected to be not very much larger , say at most by 200mev , than the quark chemical potential @xmath8mev in nuclear matter . in the quasiparticle model , from the chemical potential where the extrapolated pressure vanishes at @xmath76 , we estimate @xmath77mev .",
    "this value is in the expected ball park , which encourages us to consider the extrapolation of the model down to smaller temperatures .",
    "although for @xmath56 quark matter will be in the superconducting phase , it is still possible to give an estimate of its equation of state in that region from the quasiparticle model .",
    "the quark pairing influences thermodynamic bulk properties at the order of @xmath78 , with the gap energy @xmath79 being at most 100mev @xcite .",
    "this has little effect on the energy density @xmath41 as both the quasiparticle contributions and the function @xmath39 are parametrically of the order @xmath80 .",
    "for the pressure , on the other hand , the pairing effects become comparable to our expression @xmath81 only when the latter becomes small .",
    "since the pressure of the thermodynamically favored superconducting phase is larger than that of the plasma phase , the relation @xmath82 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e(p ) ] is therefore an upper estimate of the equation of state of cold quark matter .    .",
    "[ fig : e(p ) ] ]    for @xmath83 , we obtain @xmath84 , where the slope is mainly determined by the fact that the pressure at @xmath76 essentially scales as @xmath85 . for smaller pressure ,",
    "the slope is only slightly larger , and the energy at @xmath63 is approximately near @xmath12 , the fit led to a similar value for @xmath45 , but to @xmath86 .",
    "this demonstrates that details of the underlying lattice data are important for quantitative predictions at @xmath9 but , on the other hand , that the estimates are rather robust . ]",
    ". assuming @xmath4mev , this translates into an energy density of 1gev/@xmath0 .",
    "bearing in mind that this is an upper estimate , and comparing to the bag model equation of state , @xmath88 , this result is still considerably larger than estimates with commonly assumed values of the bag constant @xmath89 .",
    "coming back to the region of the phase space where the quasiparticle model is well grounded , we finally address the question of the behavior of the pressure and the energy density along the critical line near @xmath14 . in the lattice simulations",
    "@xcite both quantities have been found to be constant within the numerical errors .",
    "this is compatible with our result for small @xmath5 , p(t_c(),)-p(t_c(0),0 ) -0.02",
    "the corresponding change in the energy density is about three times larger .",
    "these results differ notably from the estimate from the bag model which , although the critical line has a similar shape for small @xmath5 , would yield coefficients larger by a factor of four .",
    "within our quasiparticle model @xcite we analyze recent @xmath2 qcd lattice calculations @xcite of the equation of state at nonzero temperature and @xmath3 , and then extend the quasiparticle model to nonzero baryon density .",
    "the resulting elliptic flow equation for the coupling relates the thermodynamic potential along the characteristic curves in the @xmath58 plane .",
    "we argue that the characteristic line through @xmath72 is related to the critical line in the phase diagram .",
    "this is confirmed by comparing our results for the curvature of the critical line at @xmath3 , and the variation of the equation of state along it , with recent lattice simulations @xcite exploring the region of small @xmath5 .",
    "we give an estimate for the equation of state of cold quark matter . energy density and pressure",
    "are almost linearly related , as in the bag model , however with parameters obtained from the lattice data at @xmath14 .",
    "the relevant physical scale is given by the transition temperature @xmath12 , and the parameter corresponding to the bag constant turns out to be large compared to conventional estimates , @xmath90mev@xmath91 .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the case @xmath10 , for which the lattice data for the equation of state at @xmath3 appear to be established best .",
    "however , we expect similar results for other numbers of flavors since the pronounced decrease of the ratio @xmath92 as @xmath40 approaches @xmath12 , which indicates a large coupling strength , seems to be generic .",
    "this universality is then echoed at nonzero @xmath5 because for all @xmath93 the flow equation behaves for strong coupling similarly as in the perturbative limit , where @xmath1 is constant along the elliptic - like characteristics . indeed , the shape of the phase boundary calculated in @xcite for the physically relevant case @xmath94 , although now being a crossover near @xmath12 , is very similar to the shape for @xmath10 . with the same reasoning",
    ", we remark that our estimates are robust with respect to remaining uncertainties of the underlying lattice data .",
    "indeed , the equation of state at @xmath9 is not very sensitive to the precise values of the model parameters as long as they reasonably describe the gross features of the equation of state at @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the large energy density at small pressure seems to be a general feature of the equation of state .    as shown in @xcite ,",
    "this would allow for pure quark stars with masses @xmath95 and radii @xmath96 km .",
    "similar small and light quark stars have also been obtained within other approaches , cf .",
    "such objects are of interest in the ongoing discussion of the data of the quark star candidate rxj1856.5 - 3754 @xcite",
    ". it should be emphasized , however , that the outermost layers of such pure quark stars are metastable with respect to hadronic matter with a larger pressure at @xmath97 .",
    "the details of the star structure depend sensitively on the hadronic equation of state @xcite .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , a stable branch of hybrid stars with a dense quark core and a thin hadronic mantle could indeed be possible .",
