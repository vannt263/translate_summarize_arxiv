    "soon after the invention of laser , the transient first - order interference pattern with two independent lasers was reported @xcite .",
    "it seems that the observed interference pattern is due to the interference of photons emitted by different lasers , which contradicts dirac s statement .",

    "however , this phenomenon can be well understood with the concept of photon if the superposition principle in feynman s path integral theory is employed @xcite .",
    "when two independent lasers are superposed , there are two different ways to trigger a photon detection event in the observing plane . one way is the detected photon is emitted by one of the lasers and the other way the detected photon is emitted by the other laser .",
    "if these two different ways are indistinguishable , the probability amplitude of detecting a photon is the sum of these two probability amplitudes corresponding to the two different ways to trigger a photon detection event .",

    "when these two different ways are distinguishable in principle , the probabilities instead of probability amplitudes should be added , in which there is no first - order interference .",
