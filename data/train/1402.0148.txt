    "@xcite discovered lmc x3 during the first year of the _ uhuru _ mission . in 1983 , @xcite showed via dynamical observations that the compact x - ray source in this 1.7-day binary is a black hole . in @xcite",
    "we use new optical data to derive a much - improved dynamical model of the system , which contains a b - type secondary . of chief importance ,",
    "orosz et al .",
    "report tight constraints on the orbital inclination angle of the binary , @xmath2  deg , and the mass of the black hole , @xmath3 .",
    "lmc x3 is unusual compared to the full assemblage of black - hole binary systems : on the one hand , like the transient systems , its x - ray intensity is highly variable because the black hole is fed by roche - lobe overflow . on the other hand",
    ", however , the system almost continually maintains itself in an x - ray bright mode like the persistent ( wind - fed ) systems @xcite .",
    "transient versus persistent black holes are further set apart by the properties of their black hole primaries : the transient black hole masses are low and tightly distributed ( @xmath4 ) , while the masses of the persistent black holes are appreciably higher ( @xmath5 ; @xcite )",
    ". meanwhile , the spins of the transients are widely distributed ( @xmath6 ) , while the three persistent black holes with spin measurements are all high ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the mode of mass transfer firmly identifies lmc x3 as belonging to the class of transient black hole binaries .",
    "the low mass of lmc x3 s primary and its low spin ( reported herein ) are perfectly congruent with this classification .    despite strong variations in x - ray brightness ( @xmath8 orders of magnitude ) ,",
    "the x - ray spectrum of lmc x3 is nearly always in a thermal , disk - dominated state ( ideal for measuring spin via the continuum - fitting method ) , except during occasional prolonged excursions into a low - intensity hard state ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "because the x - ray spectrum is strongly disk - dominated , relatively featureless , and minimally affected by interstellar absorption , lmc x3 is a touchstone for testing spectral models of black - hole accretion disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in a precursor to this work , we fitted all archival x - ray spectra with reliable flux calibration to a relativistic model of a thin accretion disk . for hundreds of rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) spectra , we showed that the inner radius of the disk is constant to within @xmath9% over a span of 14 years despite the gross variability of the source .",
    "furthermore , for an ensemble of eight x - ray missions spanning 26 years , we showed that the radius is constant to better than @xmath10% , despite the uncertainties associated with cross - calibrating the various detectors .",
    "this result is the strongest observational evidence to date that spin can be reliably inferred by measuring the inner - disk radius .    the elegant simplicity of a black hole is encapsulated in the famous \" no - hair theorem  , which tells us that an astrophysical black hole is _ completely _ described by just its mass and spin angular momentum ( the third parameter , electrical charge , being effectively neutral in astrophysical settings ) .",
    "a spinning black hole is an enormous capacitor of angular momentum , with the spin as a ready energy source that can be tapped mechanically in a black hole s ergosphere .",
    "spin has long been proposed as the likely energy source behind the enormously energetic jets emitted from black holes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this assumption has gained recent support both theoretically ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and observationally ( @xcite , but see @xcite ) .",
    "the two primary means by which black hole spins are measured are 1 ) x - ray continuum - fitting @xcite , and 2 ) modeling relativistic reflection ( frequently termed the `` fe - line '' method ) @xcite .",
    "the single precept which underpins both methods is the monotonic relationship between spin and the radius of the innermost - stable circular orbit ( isco ) for particles orbiting the black hole .",
    "consequently , by determining @xmath11 , which is presumed to be the inner - radius of the accretion disk , one may directly infer a black hole s angular momentum @xmath12 , usually expressed as the dimensionless spin parameter , @xmath13    the continuum - fitting method  the basis for the work presented here  has been used to estimate the spins of roughly a dozen stellar - mass black holes ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein , @xcite ) . in this method , the inner - disk radius is estimated using the thermal , multicolor blackbody continuum emission from the disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the fe - line method measures @xmath14 using the redward extent of relativistic broadening of reflection features in the disk , and has been applied just as widely ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "both methods , but especially the fe - line method , are also being applied to measure the spins of supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "lmc x3 is ideal for continuum - fitting as it offers a strong , dominantly thermal continuum at nearly all times .",
    "however , its spectra accordingly contain very little signal in reflection , and so reflection models can not constrain spin for this source .",
    "prior to this investigation , a preliminary estimate of lmc x3 s spin was obtained via a continuum - fitting measurement from a single _ bepposax _ spectrum by @xcite , later bolstered by @xcite .",
    "their results were hampered primarily by the poorly constrained mass available at the time , and so only a rough estimate was possible , @xmath15 .",
    "employing the new and precise mass measurement from @xcite , we revisit lmc x3 s spin determination . using the largest data set available to us  over a decade of pointed monitoring with ( _ rxte _ )",
    " we estimate the spin and its uncertainty for lmc x3 via x - ray continuum fitting .",
    "we replicate the reduction and analysis techniques adopted in @xcite while considering the _ full _ set of _ rxte _ pointed observations over the mission lifetime .",
    "to ensure the most consistent analysis , we only use data for the pcu-2 detector , which has the most stable calibration and was most frequently active .",
    "we separate and analyze each segment of continuous exposure , applying a 300  s lower limit .",
    "for very long observations , we divide the interval into segments with individual exposure times less than 5000  s. in total , this yields 1598 spectra with an average exposure time and net signal of @xmath16  ks and @xmath17  counts , respectively .",
    "the spectra have been background subtracted and corrected for detector dead time .",
    "we fit the data over the energy range 2.825  kev and include a 1% systematic error in the count rates in each channel to account for uncertainties in the response of the detector .",
    "we use the average pcu-2 spectrum of the crab to establish our standard absolute flux calibration @xcite . for this step ,",
    "we use the model crabcor @xcite which rescales the normalization by 9.7% and adjusts the spectral index by @xmath18 .",
    "there is relatively little interstellar absorption , @xmath19 @xcite , which is kept fixed during fitting and modeled via tbabs @xcite .",
    "errors are everywhere quoted at the @xmath20 level unless otherwise indicated . for the primary  i.e. , thermal disk  component of emission",
    ", we use kerrbb2 @xcite , which incorporates all relativistic effects and directly solves for spin .",
    "the model kerrbb2 assumes that the disk is razor thin and optically thick . to apply",
    "kerrbb2 one must specify four external input parameters : black hole mass , disk inclination , distance @xmath21 and the viscosity parameter @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the compton power - law component is modeled empirically using simpl @xcite .",
    "our complete spectral model is expressed as tbabs(simpl@xmath23kerrbb2)@xmath24crabcor .    as an initial step in the analysis",
    ", we fit the full data set to our spectral model using fiducial values for @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( section  [ section : intro ] ) and a distance @xmath27  kpc @xcite , and adopting a viscosity @xmath28 .",
    "we include limb darkening and returning radiation effects , adopt zero torque at the inner - disk boundary , and make the standard assumption that the black hole s spin axis is aligned with the orbital angular momentum @xcite .",
    "there are just four free fit parameters : @xmath1 , mass accretion rate @xmath29 , photon spectral index @xmath30 , and the scattering fraction @xmath31 ( the fraction of disk photons scattered in the corona ) .",
    "we constrained the photon index to lie in the range @xmath32 ; the three other parameters are unconstrained .",
    "subsequent to fitting all of the spectra , we use our initial results to screen out spectra that are unsuitable for the measurement of spin : we reject data for which @xmath31 exceeds 25% ( 141/1598 ; see @xcite ) .",
    "we likewise discard data for which the goodness - of - fit @xmath33 ( 4/1598 ) , arriving at a sample of 1454 thermal - state spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig : fit ] shows a fit to one representative spectrum .",
    "the thermal component in red plainly dominates the flux , and our model of a featureless comptonized disk provides a more - than sufficient fit ( @xmath34 ) , with only four free parameters .",
    "a restriction of kerrbb2 is that it is only applicable to those data firmly in the `` thin - disk '' limit ( scale height @xmath35 ) .",
    "the scale - height of the x - ray emitting region of the disk is determined by radiation pressure , itself set by the luminosity .",
    "previous work has demonstrated that the presence of a geometrically - thin , optically - thick disk can be reliably assumed over the luminosity range @xmath36 , where the eddington - luminosity @xmath37  erg  s@xmath38 @xcite .     ]",
    "in our initial run , a total of 391 spectra fulfilling the thermal selection also match this luminosity ( thin - disk ) criterion . using the spectra which make both cuts ,",
    "we obtain a spin @xmath39 ( weighted mean and its 1@xmath40 error ) .",
    "a comprehensive run is now performed to assess the error in spin from uncertainties in the other measurement quantities . for each point along a grid of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath21 , we repeat our spectral fits to the pre - selection of 1454 spectra .",
    "mass is sampled from @xmath41 , inclination @xmath42 , and @xmath43  kpc .",
    "the values of @xmath44 depend upon @xmath45 and @xmath21 , but typically @xmath46 of these spectra fulfill the luminosity criterion . at _ each",
    "_ gridpoint , the distribution of spin from the selected spectra gives a single , mean spin , and its uncertainty , while the mean of the distribution is determined with much greater precision . ] . by applying weights according to the probability of each gridpoint ( calculated using the measurements of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath21 given in sections  [ section : intro],[section : data ] ) , results are combined to achieve a composite distribution in spin",
    "this distribution is inclusive of _ all measurement errors_.    in previous work , we have assessed the effects of a wide range of systematic errors @xcite and found that only two are significant : the uncertainty in @xmath22 and the uncertainty in the spectrum of the crab , which we use as our flux standard ( section  [ section : data ] ) .",
    "we take uncertainty in @xmath22 into account by repeating the analysis for @xmath47 and @xmath48 and then averaging the spin distributions , weighting them equally .",
    "we incorporate a 10% uncertainty in the absolute x - ray flux calibration @xcite by broadening our distribution in @xmath14 using a gaussian kernel with 5% width .",
    "finally , an additional 2% broadening is used to account for the small variation introduced by adopting a different choice of comptonization model ( @xcite ) .",
    "the combined result is shown in figure  [ fig : spindist ] .",
    "our _ final _ measurement of spin , including all measurement _ and _ systematic uncertainties is @xmath49 ( 90% ) . for comparison , our measurement without considering systematic errors ( using @xmath28 ) yielded @xmath50 ( 90% ) .",
    "table  [ tab : results ] gives our final determination of spin as measured at several confidence levels , explicitly given because the measurement errors in spin are generally nonlinear .",
    "as a bottom line , lmc x3 has a precisely determined spin , which is low .",
    "lcc 68% ( @xmath20 ) & @xmath51 & @xmath52 + 90% & @xmath53 & @xmath54 + 95% ( @xmath55 ) & @xmath56 & @xmath57 + 99.7% ( @xmath58 ) & @xmath59 & @xmath60 [ tab : results ]     ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the abcissa is scaled logarithmically in @xmath14 , a metric which reflects our measurement scale .",
    "the corresponding quantity of chief physical interest , namely @xmath62 , is shown on the lower axis .",
    "our final distribution ( solid line ) incorporates measurement error and systematic error , most notably uncertainties in the @xmath22-viscosity and the absolute flux calibration .",
    "the pair of dash - dotted lines indicate the 90% confidence interval .",
    "the dotted line shows our result for @xmath28 ignoring the effects of systematic error ( where the probability distribution has been rescaled for comparison ) .",
    "[ fig : spindist ] ]",
    "in section  [ section : results ] we considered the effects of all measurement errors and known systematic errors on our estimate of @xmath62 ( apart from the assumption that the black hole s spin is aligned with the orbital angular momentum vector ; see section 5.4 in @xcite ) . in this section",
    "we consider the error we incur by our reliance on the novikov - thorne model and conclude that it is relatively small .",
    "we then compare the low spin of lmc x3 to the spins of several other sources , tentatively concluding that the compton component is relatively weak for low spin black holes and strong for rapidly spinning ones .",
    "while our earlier study of lmc x3 @xcite , and similar studies of other black hole binaries ( e.g. , @xcite ) , provide compelling evidence that the inner disk radius is constant in black hole binaries , it does not prove that this radius is in fact @xmath63 .",
    "the central assumption of the thin - disk model is that the viscous torque vanishes at the isco and that no flux is emitted from within this radius .",
    "this assumption has been tested by several groups using sophisticated general - relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( grmhd ) codes .",
    "the results from two groups are exemplified by three key studies , each aimed at testing the reliability of spin estimates .",
    "results from one group are reported in @xcite , and from the other in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both groups produce synthetic observations of their simulations as they would appear to a distant observer at a range of viewing angles .",
    "although there are subtle differences in the approaches taken by the two groups , one can make a reasonably direct comparison between @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both groups used ad hoc but reasonable cooling prescriptions in post - processing to convert magnetic stresses into radiation . by treating the dissipation as local and thermal , disk spectra",
    "have been generated for a nonspinning black hole by noble et al . and for black holes with a range of spins by kulkarni et al . from these two works ,",
    "one concludes that spin measurements systematically _ overestimate _ the spin , that this effect is most pronounced at high inclination , and that the fractional change in @xmath14 is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "the deviation of @xmath64 from unity is of order ten percent .",
    "however , the state - of - the - art analysis has been achieved by @xcite , and its findings differ appreciably , as we now discuss .",
    "zhu et al .  include , as an additional post - processing step , full radiative - transfer through the disk atmosphere in generating the simulated grmhd spectra .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath65% shift in @xmath64 reported by @xcite and @xcite , zhu et al . find a much smaller deviation because their more sophisticated approach identifies a hard power - law component of emission that is largely produced inside @xmath11 .",
    "it is this component , which in the earlier work was lumped in with the thermal emission , that was largely responsible for the shift in @xmath64 . analyzing their simulated spectra using the model in section  [ section : data ] , zhu et al .",
    "find that the shift in @xmath64 is only @xmath66 and that it depends only weakly on inclination , @xmath22 , and luminosity ( see table  2 in @xcite ) .    in short",
    ", deviations from novikov - thorne are likely of minor consequence . for the nominal spin of lmc x3 , a 3% offset in @xmath14 would imply @xmath67 ( a shift of @xmath68 ) , or a 0.4@xmath40 correction to our final result .",
    "although the spins of more than a dozen stellar - mass black holes have been measured , only two have spins as low as lmc x3 , namely , a062000 and h1743 - 322 @xcite .",
    "the spectra of a062000 and lmc x3 ( at luminosities @xmath69 ) are remarkably simple , consisting of a dominant thermal component with compton power - law and reflection components that are always quite faint .",
    "the spectrum of h1743322 is not as consistently simple .",
    "however , for a large sample of 65 thermal spectra , the compton ( and reflection ) component of this source is very faint with a mean strength of @xmath70 = 1.2% @xcite , weaker than for any other sources with a spin measurement ( apart from a026000 and lmc x3 ) .",
    "the simplicity of the spectra of these three sources contrasts sharply with the spectra of the two extreme - spin sources , cyg x1 and grs 1915 + 105 ( @xcite , and references therein ) , and to a lesser degree the spectrum of lmc x1 ( @xmath71 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the spectra of these sources are generally complex ; i.e. , they show strong rms variability ( from their power - density spectra ) , are strongly comptonized , and contain prominent reflection features .",
    "comparison with the simple spectra of a062000 , lmc x3 and h1743322 suggests that spectral complexity is correlated with spin .",
    "a prediction of this hypothesis is that the spin of gs  2000 + 25 , whose spectral properties ( and outburst light curve ) are very similar to that of a062000 @xcite , is very low , and that the spin of v404 cyg , whose spectrum was consistently observed to be strongly comptonized @xcite , is quite high .",
    "one other source may be able to provide a strong test of our prediction : 4u1957 + 11 .",
    "although the spin and mass are presently unknown , there are indications that the former is likely high and the latter likely low @xcite , while its spectrum is very thermal and generally only weakly comptonized .",
    "confirmation of an extreme spin for 4u 1957 + 11 could decisively rule out this hypothesis .",
    "we have analyzed all 1598 spectra of lmc x3 collected during the _ rxte _ mission . using a selected sample of @xmath72 spectra , our precise measurement of black hole mass and inclination @xcite , and the continuum - fitting method , we derive a strong constraint on the spin of the black hole : @xmath49 ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "our comprehensive error estimate takes into account all known sources of uncertainty , e.g. , the uncertainties in @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and in the absolute x - ray flux calibration .",
    "the simple and predominately thermal spectra of lmc x3 and a062000 , the black holes with the lowest measured spins , contrast sharply with the complex and strongly comptonized spectra of grs  1915 + 105 and cyg x1 , the two black holes with near - extreme spin .",
    "this comparison suggests a possible link between spin and the degree of spectral complexity , a hypothesis that can be tested , and which predicts a low spin for gs  2000 + 25 and a high spin for v404 cyg . the black hole 4u 1957 + 11 may allow a falsification of the hypothesis , if its spin can be measured .    by virtue of the no - hair theorem",
    ", we have a complete and quite precise description of the black hole in lmc x3 .",
    "these three  and only three ",
    "characteristics define the black hole in entirety : a charge of zero , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "this work was made possible by the odyssey computing cluster , supported by the fas science division research computing group at harvard university .",
    "we thank chris done for enlivening discussions on lmc x3 and colleen hodge - wilson for providing data on the crab s variability .",
