    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are non - nuclear accreting x - ray sources whose apparent luminosity exceeds the eddington limit of galactic stellar mass black holes ( @xmath3  erg  s@xmath4  for a 20 @xmath5 black hole ) .",
    "since they were discovered in 1970s @xcite , their physical nature is still unclear ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "deep x - ray studies in recent years favor the interpretation that most ulxs are likely due to supercritical accretion onto stellar mass black holes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with dynamical evidence in a couple cases @xcite .",
    "theoretical models and numerical simulations @xcite suggest that massive outflows are inevitable for supercritical accretion . the outflows may be optically - thick and play an important role in shaping the emergent x - ray energy spectrum and timing behavoir .",
    "it is generally agreed that the disk will be thick and inefficient in radiation , e.g. , the slim disk model @xcite .",
    "however , recent 3d radiation magneto - hydrodynamic simulations of supercritical accretion by @xcite show that vertical advection induced by turbulence generated by the magneto - rotational instability can produce radiative efficiency as high as standard thin - disk accretion and nearly isotropic emission .",
    "however , the ulx population is heterogeneous .",
    "extreme ulxs like eso 243 - 49 hlx-1 and m82 x-1 are good candidates for intermediate mass black holes @xcite . while a transient ulx in m82 with a peak luminosity over @xmath6  erg  s@xmath4  @xcite is powered by accretion onto a neutron star @xcite .",
    "the nature of ulxs is still a question under debate and more observations are needed .    unlike typical ulxs which exhibit substantial emission above 2 kev",
    ", there exists a sub - class whose x - ray spectrum is dominated by emission from a blackbody - like ( @xmath7  kev ) component below 2 kev @xcite . well studied examples include those in m51 @xcite , m81 @xcite , m101 @xcite , ngc 247 @xcite , ngc 300 @xcite , the antennae ( ngc4038/4039 ; * ? ? ?",

    "multi - epoch observations of the canonical soft ulx in m101 revealed dramatic variability in the observed x - ray flux by 23 orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "such strong variability is rare for broad - band ulxs .",
    "@xcite performed a comprehensive x - ray study of the brightest soft ulxs .",
    "they found a correlation between the blackbody temperature and emission radius , @xmath8 , for their sample .",
    "@xcite identified a similar relation , roughly @xmath9 , for the soft ulx in m101 from multi - epoch observations .",
    "this seems to be a universal relation for soft ulxs .",
    "it has been proposed that the soft spectrum of soft ulxs could be emission from the photosphere of optically thick outflows , which obscure or soften the hard emission from the inner disk @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that the soft ulxs and broad - band ulxs are the same type of objects viewed at different angles .",
    "@xcite suggest that the soft ulxs could be a special state of the normal ulxs ; they may transition to be broad - band ulxs when the photosphere becomes smaller and hotter ( @xmath10  ev ) .",

    "the treatment of absorption is also crucial to the characterization of the soft component .    given a negative @xmath170 relation , the most plausible explanation is that these emission components may arise from the photosphere of massive outflows associated with supercritical accretion @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath204 relation is true , it is consistent with a scenario that the emission comes from cool disks around more massive black holes .",
    "one of the major differences between the ssul regime the spectral / timing regimes of broad - band ulxs is that most soft excesses seen in broad - band ulxs are less variable on short or long timescales than the soft blackbody component seen in the ssul regime .",
    "a possible explanation may be that the blackbody - like emission from these two classes of sources may both be associated with outflows due to supercritical accretion , but they happen at different accretion rates ( supersoft ulxs may have a higher accretion rate ) . alternatively , as mentioned above , the two emission components may be identical under the scenario of the geometric interpretation .      in supercritical accretion models ,",
    "massive outflows are a key feature predicted by theories and numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "observationally , the detection of soft x - ray spectral residuals @xcite and emission / absorption lines @xcite in ulxs have been argued as a signature of outflows associated with supercritical accretion .",

    "such a feature may be common in these sources and is interpreted as a result of absorption by clumpy winds @xcite .",

    "similar features are also observed in other soft ulxs ( m51 and m101 ; see table  4 in * ? ? ?",
    "the origin of the thermal plasma is still unknown .",
    "it may be due to shocks generated by wind - wind interaction or between the disk wind and stellar wind from the companion star .",
    "the normalization of the apec model ( @xmath205 in xspec ) suggests that @xmath206 . the thermal plasma emitting region should lie outside of the photosphere of the outflow and have a lower density than the photosphere .",

    "the energy of the line at 0.58  kev is consistent with emission from highly ionized oxygen ( ovii at 0.574  kev ) , whose cooling rate peaks at a temperature ( 0.17  kev ) close to the detected blackbody temperature ( 0.13  kev ) .",

    ". the inferred mass of the black hole is consistent with that measured for ic 10 x-1 @xcite and the binary black holes associated with the gravitational wave event gw150914 @xcite , and can be explained as a result of core - collapse of stars of low metallicity .",
    "the accretion rate is extremely high but comparable to or lower than the estimated accretion rate for the galactic microquasar ss  433 @xcite .      during the 2014 _ xmm - newton _ observation",

    "the transition between the high flux state and the low state occurs on a timescale of @xmath29200  s. x - ray flux dips have been observed in other ulxs , e.g. , in broad - band ulxs in ngc 55 @xcite , ngc 5408 @xcite , and m94 @xcite , and also in soft ulxs in m51 and m81 @xcite .",
    "their nature is not determined . here the high quality _ xmm - newton _ data allows us to see the hardness change during the dips .",
    "it is clearly seen in figure  [ fig : lc ] that the blackbody temperature becomes low when entering the dip and then goes high when leaving the dip , in a manner smoother than the change of flux .",
    "the x - ray spectrum and flux in the dips are similar to those in the 2009 _ xmm - newton _ spectrum .",
    "both the spectral fitting and the change of hardness ratio clearly argue against the interpretation that the dips are purely due to absorption or partial absorption , further supported by the change of the blackbody temperature and emitting size ( cooler and larger in the dips ) .",
    "therefore , the dips are likely caused by the change of the properties of the photosphere itself .",
    "again , a large and variable equatorial occulter could be another plausible explanation for the dips .",
    "we estimate the physical timescales associated with dipping as follows .",
    "the wind launching radius or the spherization radius is @xmath220 . assuming @xmath221 and a disk inner radius @xmath222  cm for a stellar mass black hole , the spherization radius is on the order of @xmath223  cm , close to the photosphere radius of the wind , @xmath224  cm .",

    "as the viscous timescale @xmath234 is strongly dependent on the disk thickness , for a thick disk ( @xmath235 ) the viscous timescale and the thermal timescale could be on the same order of magnitude and both close to @xmath236  s. however , even an order - of - magnitude estimate would be difficult at such a high accretion rate , too little is understood about the disk structure .",
    "we note that @xcite assumed an accretion rate of 22 times the eddington rate and the simulation only reached a radius of 50@xmath237  cm .    therefore , it is possible that the dipping is due to the change of accretion rate on the viscous timescale or is related to some instability due to thermal effects on the wind or disk .",
