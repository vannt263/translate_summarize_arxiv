    "in recent years there has been a continuous interest in the study of excited heavy mesons composed of a heavy quark and a light anti - quark .",
    "this interest arises from several reasons . some of these excited states have been observed in experiments .",
    "they will be objects of further study in future experiments with b - factories .",
    "in particular , they are useful for tagging in cp experiments @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the relative simplicity of the dynamical condition makes it of interest for exploring the internal dynamics of systems containing a light quark .",
    "important progresses in the theoretical description of such systems have been achieved with the development of the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite .",
    "based on the spin - flavor symmetry of qcd , valid in the limit of infinite heavy quark mass @xmath5 , this framework provides a systematic expansion of heavy hadron spectra and transition amplitudes in terms of the leading contribution , plus corrections decreasing as powers of @xmath6 . however , to obtain some detailed predictions one needs to combine it with some non - perturbative methods .",
    "the spectra and decay widths of heavy meson excited states have been studied with the @xmath6 expansion in the relativistic bethe - salpeter equations in @xcite .",
    "they can also be studied with the qcd sum rules in hqet which have been used both for ground states of heavy mesons @xcite and for lowest excited heavy meson doublets @xmath3 and @xmath4 at leading order of the @xmath6 expansion@xcite . for related results ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian of the hqet , up to order @xmath6 , can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the velocity - dependent field related to the original heavy - quark field @xmath9 by @xmath10 @xmath11 is the operator of nonrelativistic kinetic energy with a negative sign defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 , with @xmath14 is the gauge - covariant derivative , and @xmath2 is the pauli term , describing the chromomagnetic interaction : @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 . apart from leading contribution",
    ", the lagrangian density contains to @xmath0 accuracy two additional operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the matrix elements of these two operators over heavy meson states are fundamental parameters in the @xmath6 expansion with hqet that should be either determined phenomenologically from experimental data or estimated using a nonperturbative theoretical approach .",
    "the matrix element of the chromomagnetic interaction operator is the leading contribution to the mass splitting among the states belonging to the same heavy meson doublet .    in our previous work @xcite , the masses of lowest excited heavy meson doublets @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    "are calculated at the leading order of @xmath6 expansion by using the qcd sum rule approach in hqet .",
    "as an extension of this work , in the present article we shall use the qcd sum rules in hqet to obtain quantitative estimates of the matrix elements of the kinetic energy and chromomagnetic interaction operators , which are responsible for the kinetic energy and the chromomagnetic mass corrections .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we begin with a brief review on the interpolating currents for excited heavy mesons and some important properties of these currents .",
    "some results of two - point functions for the doublets @xmath18 and @xmath19 at the leading order of the @xmath6 expansion are outlined .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to @xmath0 corrections , the sum rules for the relevant matrix elements of kinetic energy and chromomagnetic interaction operator are derived .",
    "finally , numerical results are presented in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "a basic element in the application of qcd sum rules to excited heavy mesons is to choose a set of appropriate interpolating currents in terms of quark fields which create ( annihilate ) definite states of excited heavy mesons . for excited heavy mesons with arbitrary spin and parity",
    "this problem has been studied in our previous paper @xcite . here",
    "we briefly outline the results of this analysis which will be used in this article .    from the general form of the leading order b - s",
    "wave function obtained in @xcite , we can write the general expression of the interpolating current creating a excited heavy meson with arbitrary spin @xmath20 and parity @xmath21 as    [ current ] @xmath22 or @xmath23      [ conju ] @xmath34 \\label{conju2 } j_{j , p , i}^{'\\alpha_1\\cdots\\alpha_j}(x)&=&\\bar q(x)(i\\stackrel{\\leftarrow } { \\not\\!{\\cal d}}_{x_t})\\bar{\\gamma}_{j , p , i}^{\\{\\alpha_1\\cdots\\alpha_j\\}}(\\stackrel{\\leftarrow}{\\cal { d}}_{x_t})h_{v(x)}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 , correspond to the annihilation of the same meson .",
    "the currents defined in ( [ current ] ) and ( [ conju ] ) have nice properties .",
    "we had shown in @xcite that two currents in the sets ( [ current1 ] ) and ( [ current2 ] ) with not identical values of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath36 never mix in the @xmath37 limit either in the heavy meson or in the quark - gluon level and heavy quark symmetry is explicit with these currents .",
    "this verifies that they are the appropriate interpolating currents for heavy meson states with definite @xmath20 , @xmath21 and the light quark angular momentum @xmath38 which is conserved in qcd in @xmath37 limit .",
    "the properties for currents mentioned above are important for applications to qcd sum rules for excited heavy mesons . if one use other currents or study the sum rules in full qcd , there are in general contributions from two nearby poles corresponding to states of the same @xmath20 , @xmath21 which have different values of the total angular momentum of the light component @xmath39 in the @xmath37 limit .",
    "their contributions may not be separated correctly .",
    "furthermore , the mixing of such two states can be calculated within our formalism by introducing the @xmath0 terms in the lagrangian in hqet .",
    "let @xmath40 be a heavy meson state with the quantum numbers @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath36 in the @xmath37 limit , together with the corresponding interpolating current , we have @xcite @xmath41 where the decay constant @xmath42 has the same value for the two states in the same doublet and @xmath43 is the transverse , symmetric and traceless polarization tensor .    in the framework of qcd sum rules",
    "the decay constant can be obtained from the two - point correlator : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the residual momentum , corresponding to the decomposition @xmath46 of the heavy meson momentum .",
    "this expression has the following form at the leading order @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is twice the external off - shell energy and @xmath49 denotes symmetrization and subtracting the trace terms in the sets @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is independent of @xmath20 and satisfies dispersion relations of the form : @xmath53 where @xmath54 represents the spectral density .",
    "we shall confine our study to the doublets @xmath18 and @xmath19 here . according to ( [ current1 ] ) ,",
    "( [ current2 ] ) and ( [ gamma2 ] ) , there are two possible choices for currents creating @xmath55 and @xmath56 of the doublet @xmath18 , either @xmath57 or @xmath58 similarly , there are two possible choices for the currents creating @xmath56 and @xmath59 of the doublet @xmath19 .",
    "one is , the coefficient @xmath60 should be @xmath61 . ]",
    "@xmath62 another choice is obtained by adding a factor @xmath63 to ( [ curr5 ] ) and ( [ curr6 ] ) .",
    "note that , without the last term in the bracket in ( [ curr5 ] ) the current would couple also to the @xmath56 state in the doublet @xmath18 even in the limit of infinite @xmath5 .",
    "usually , the currents with the least number of derivatives are used in the qcd sum rule approach .",
    "the sum rules with them have better convergence in the high energy region and often have better stability .",
    "however , there is a motivation for using the currents ( [ curr3 ] ) , ( [ curr4 ] ) for the doublet @xmath18 . in the non - relativistic quark model , which usually gives correct ordering of energy levels of hadron states ,",
    "the doublets @xmath18 and @xmath19 are orbital p - wave states which correspond to one derivative in the space wave functions .",
    "in fact , as proved in @xcite , the coupling constant for the currents ( [ curr3 ] ) , ( [ curr4 ] ) and that for ( [ curr5 ] ) , ( [ curr6 ] ) are proportional to the large components of the b - s wave functions for the doublet @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively in the non - relativistic approximation . therefore , we shall consider both the currents ( [ curr1 ] ) , ( [ curr2 ] ) and ( [ curr3 ] ) , ( [ curr4 ] ) for the doublet @xmath18 .    for the doublet @xmath18 ,",
    "when the currents @xmath64 , @xmath65 in ( [ curr3 ] ) , ( [ curr4 ] ) are used the sum rule ( same for the two states ) after the borel transformation is found to be @xmath66 the corresponding formula when the current @xmath67 and @xmath68 in ( [ curr1 ] ) and ( [ curr2 ] ) are used instead of @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the following @xmath69 when the currents ( [ curr5 ] ) and ( [ curr6 ] ) are used the sum rule for the @xmath19 doublet is found to be @xmath70 here @xmath71 . in the above derivations , we have confined us to terms of the lowest order in perturbation and operators of dimension less than six . above results",
    "shall be used in the next section .",
    "from lorentz covariance , the correlator ( [ sum1 ] ) still has the form ( [ sum2 ] ) beyond the leading order of @xmath6 expansion if we confine @xmath45 to be a longitudinal vector .",
    "but now @xmath72 depends on @xmath20 due to the chromomagnetic interaction operator @xmath2 . inserting the heavy meson eigen - state of the hamiltonian up to the order @xmath0 , the pole term on the hadron side becomes @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are of the order @xmath0 .    to extract @xmath74 in ( [ pole ] ) we follow the approach of @xcite and consider the three - point correlation functions @xmath76 where @xmath77 or @xmath2 .",
    "the sum @xmath78 is equal to the correlator ( [ sum1 ] ) in the order @xmath0 when @xmath79 .",
    "the scalar function corresponding to ( [ delta ] ) can be represented as the double dispersion integral @xmath80 the pole parts for them are @xmath81 \\label{poles } & & \\delta_{\\cal s}\\pi(\\omega,\\omega^{'})_{pole}={d_mf^2\\sigma\\over(2\\bar\\lambda-\\omega)(2\\bar\\lambda-\\omega^{'})}+d_mf\\left[{g_{\\cal s}(\\omega^{'})\\over 2\\bar\\lambda-\\omega}+{g_{\\cal s}(\\omega)\\over 2\\bar\\lambda-\\omega^{'}}\\right]\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 let @xmath79 in ( [ polek ] ) and ( [ poles ] ) , and compare it with ( [ pole ] ) one obtains@xcite @xmath83 the simple pole term in ( [ polek ] ) and ( [ poles ] ) comes from the region in which @xmath84 and @xmath85 is at the pole for a radical excited state or in the continuum .",
    "these terms are suppressed by making double borel transformation for both @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "one obtains thus the sum rules for @xmath88 and @xmath89 as @xmath90 where the spectral densities are obtained from straitforward calculations in hqet .    confining us to the leading order of perturbation and the operators with dimension @xmath91 in ope , the relevant feynman diagrams , which contribute to @xmath92 and",
    "@xmath93 are shown in fig . 1 and fig .",
    "2 respectively .",
    "the graphs missing there turn out to be vanishing in the fixed point gauge @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "the spectra functions @xmath95 and @xmath96 can be calculated from these diagrams . for the @xmath97 doublet",
    ", we find    [ msum1d ] @xmath98    when the currents ( [ curr3 ] ) and ( [ curr4 ] ) are used and    [ msum1 ] @xmath99    when the currents ( [ curr1 ] ) and ( [ curr2 ] ) with no extra derivative are used .",
    "in contrast to ( [ form - s1d ] ) , there is a nonvanishing mixing condensate term in ( [ form - s1 ] ) .",
    "it arises from the diagram depicted in fig .",
    "2(b ) . for @xmath100 doublet , a straitforward calculation yields    [ msum2 ] @xmath101    combining ( [ msum1d ] ) , ( [ msum1 ] ) and ( [ msum2 ] ) with ( [ form1 ] ) , ( [ form2 ] ) and ( [ form3 ] ) we can obtain sum rules for @xmath88 and @xmath89 in the three cases .",
    "the above results are not the whole story .",
    "the spin - symmetry violating term @xmath102 not only causes splitting of masses in the same doublet , but also causes mixing of states with the same @xmath20 , @xmath21 but different @xmath38 .",
    "this mixing is characterized by the matrix element @xmath103 this quantity can be extracted from the correlator @xmath104 the double pole term of which is @xmath105 with the methods similar to that used above one can obtain the sum rule of @xmath106 . for two @xmath56 states",
    "we find @xmath107 as an example , here we have used the currents ( [ curr4 ] ) and ( [ curr5 ] ) to do the analysis .",
    "the masses of two @xmath56 states are obtained by diagonalizing the mass matrix @xmath108 \\displaystyle{\\frac{1}{4m_q}}\\;c_{mag}m_{\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{1}{2}}(1^+ ) & \\bar\\lambda_{+,\\frac{3}{2}}-\\displaystyle{{1\\over 4m_q}}(k_{+,\\frac{3}{2}}+5\\;c_{mag}\\sigma_{+,\\frac{3}{2 } } ) \\end{array}\\;\\right)\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the correction to the masses due to the mixing is formally of the order of @xmath109 . however , due to the smallness of the difference between the two diagonal elements there is some possibility that this correction is numerically comparable to the @xmath0 corrections . therefore we shall calculate it also .",
    "we now turn to the numerical evaluation of these sum rules .",
    "we can eliminate the explicit dependence of the sum rules obtained in section [ sec3 ] on @xmath110 and @xmath111 by means of the two - point function sum rules outlined in section [ sec2 ] . dividing the sum rules in ( [ msum1d ] ) , ( [ msum1 ] ) and ( [ msum2 ] ) by the sum rules in ( [ form1 ] ) , ( [ form2 ] ) and ( [ form3 ] ) respectively , we obtain relevant expressions for the @xmath88 and @xmath89 as functions of the borel parameter @xmath112 and the continuum threshold @xmath113 . for the qcd parameters entering the theoretical expressions , we use the following standard values @xmath114",
    "the results for @xmath88 as a function of the borel variable @xmath112 , and for different values of the continuum threshold @xmath113 , are shown in fig .",
    "3 . in particular , in fig .",
    "3a and 3b we depict the results of two kinds of sum rules for doublet @xmath18 , which correspond to using two kinds of currents ( [ curr1 ] ) ( [ curr2 ] ) and ( [ curr3 ] ) ( [ curr4 ] ) respectively . in fig .",
    "3c , we display the result of sum rule associated with doublet @xmath19 .    following the qcd sum rule procedure , we should check the existence of stable regions for the results of @xmath88 in the borel variable @xmath112 and the continuum threshold @xmath113 .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "3 , stability starts at values of borel parameter @xmath112 slightly larger than @xmath115 , and stretches practically to @xmath116 . the familiar criterion that both the high - order power corrections and the contribution of the continuum model should not be too large , generally speaking , less than @xmath117 ,",
    "rather strongly restricts the ` working ' region .",
    "thus , the stability at large @xmath112 values is not useful , since in this region the sum rules is strongly contaminated by higher resonance states .",
    "this continuum model contamination problem is quite severe also in the case of sum rules analysis of ground state heavy meson to @xmath6 .",
    "it originates from the high power dependence of the spectral densities . according to @xcite ,",
    "it is better to determine the working window by considering the stability of two - point sum rules , and then to use the same values in the evaluation of the three - point sum rules .",
    "the choice of so - called stability window does not necessarily coincide with the stability plateau for the three - point sum rules . in the case of two - point function sum rules",
    "one finds that the working windows are @xmath118 gev , @xmath119 gev for the doublet @xmath18 and @xmath120 gev , @xmath119 gev for the doublet @xmath19 @xcite .    from fig .",
    "3 , taking the working regions of the sum rules as that for the two - pont function for the three cases , we obtain the set of values for @xmath88 as following : @xmath121 for the doublet @xmath18 when the currents ( [ curr1 ] ) ( [ curr2 ] ) without the derivative are used , @xmath122 for the same doublet when the currents ( [ curr3 ] ) , ( [ curr4 ] ) with the derivative are used , and @xmath123 for the doublet @xmath19 .",
    "the errors reflect the variations with the borel parameter @xmath112 and the continuum threshold @xmath113 within the working windows . as can be seen when comparing fig . 3a and fig .",
    "3b with each other , @xmath88 value in fig .",
    "3b is more sensitive to the value of @xmath113 than that in fig .",
    "3a owing to the higher dimension of spectral density for the using of current with extra derivative .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the numerical results of the sum rules for @xmath89 , corresponding to the three chosen values of the continuum threshold @xmath113 . from these figures , we see that there is no stability plateau for the sum rules of @xmath89 .",
    "this is related to the absence of perturbation terms for @xmath89 in our approximation .",
    "however , due to the strategy mentioned above we can take the working window as that of two - point function sum rules like the case of @xmath88 .",
    "the results for @xmath89 for the doublet @xmath18 in the working regions of the sum rules are @xmath124 when the currents ( [ curr1 ] ) ( [ curr2 ] ) without the derivative are used and @xmath125 when the currents ( [ curr3 ] ) , ( [ curr4 ] ) with the derivative are used . for the doublet @xmath19 , the value of @xmath89 is given by @xmath126    dividing the sum rule in ( [ cross - m ] ) by the sum rules in ( [ form2 ] ) and ( [ form3 ] ) , we also obtain the expression for @xmath127 . in fig .",
    "5 we plot the result of this sum rules as a function of @xmath112 , and for three values of @xmath113 . using the working windows as @xmath128 gev and @xmath119 gev , we obtain @xmath129 after combining with ( [ matrix ] ) , we found that the correction to the masses due to the mixing is negligibly small .    in conclusion",
    ", we have calculated the @xmath6 correction to the masses of lowest excited heavy mesons from sum rules within the framework of the hqet .",
    "this study refines the leading order analysis @xcite . from ( 42)-(47 ) , together with ( [ delm ] ) , we can obtain the corrections to the masses of excited @xmath130 mesons . for the doublet @xmath18 , our final results read @xmath131\\;,\\\\ m_{d'_1}-m_{d_0^*}&=&{1\\over m_c}\\;[(0.023\\pm 0.003)~\\text{gev}^2]\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when the currents ( [ curr1 ] ) and ( [ curr2 ] ) are used and @xmath132\\;,\\\\ m_{d'_1}-m_{d_0^*}&=&{1\\over m_c}\\;[(0.014\\pm 0.003)~\\text{gev}^2]\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when the currents ( [ curr3 ] ) and ( [ curr4 ] ) are used . as for the doublet @xmath19 , the result is @xmath133\\;,\\\\ m_{d_2^*}-m_{d_1}&=&{1\\over m_c}\\;[(0.040\\pm 0.006)~\\text{gev}^2]\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the values of @xmath111 in three cases are given in @xcite .",
    "note that we have reasonably neglected the renormalization coefficient @xmath134 of the chromomagnetic operator for charmed meson in the discussion .",
    "we should also note that the given errors present only the uncertainties of @xmath112 and @xmath113 in the working regions .",
    "the above results for the spin splittings are not theoretically reliable because we have not included the feynman diagrams which are of the one loop order in the perturbation theory and may be of values comparable to that of the gluon condensate term leading in our approximation . nevertheless , they are in approximate agreement with the experimental values for the mass splitting between @xmath135 and @xmath136 @xcite if we take @xmath137 gev .",
