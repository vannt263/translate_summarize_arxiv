    "the strong coupling constant , @xmath0 , is one of the fundamental parameters of qcd .",
    "however , its value is not predicted by the theory and has to be determined experimentally .",
    "the success of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) lies on precise and consistent determinations of the coupling from many diverse phenomena such as @xmath1 decays , event shapes , @xmath2 decays , etc . at zeus ,",
    "many precise determinations of @xmath0 have been performed from a variety of measurements based on jet observables and on structure functions .",
    "the procedure to determine @xmath0 from jet observables used by zeus is based on the @xmath0 dependence of the pqcd calculations and takes into account the correlation with the proton parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "the method consists of performing next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) calculations using sets of pdfs for which different values of @xmath3 were assumed in the fits .",
    "a parameterisation of the @xmath3 dependence of the theory for the given observable is obtained .",
    "finally , a value for @xmath3 is extracted from the measured cross section using such parameterisation .",
    "this procedure handles correctly the complete @xmath0-dependence of the nlo calculations ( the explicit dependence in the partonic cross section and the implicit dependence from the pdfs ) in the fit , while preserving the correlation between @xmath0 and the pdfs .",
    "the exclusive dijet cross section in neutral - current ( nc ) deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) has been measured  @xcite in the breit frame in the kinematic region given by @xmath4  2 , where @xmath5 is the photon virtuality .",
    "two jets with transverse energies @xmath6 and @xmath7 gev and pseudorapidity @xmath8 were selected .",
    "figure  [ fig1]a shows the ratio of the dijet cross section to the total inclusive dis cross section as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "the experimental uncertainties are small , @xmath9 .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties are smaller than for the individual cross sections .",
    "the measured ratio is described well by the pqcd prediction .",
    "the predictions for different values of @xmath0 show the sensitivity of this observable to the coupling . from the measured ratio for @xmath10  2 , the value @xmath11 was extracted . in this determination , the theoretical uncertainties coming from the higher orders dominate .",
    "inclusive - jet cross sections in nc dis have been measured  @xcite in the breit frame in the kinematic region of @xmath12  2 .",
    "events with at least one jet of @xmath13 gev and @xmath14 were selected .",
    "there are several advantages of inclusive - jet cross sections with respect to dijet cross sections in a qcd analysis .",
    "the inclusive - jet cross sections are infrared insensitive ; for dijet cross sections asymmetric @xmath15 cuts are necessary to avoid the infrared - sensitive regions where the nlo programs are not reliable .",
    "this difficulty is not present in the calculations of inclusive - jet cross sections so these measurements allow tests of pqcd in a larger phase - space region than in dijet production .",
    "furthermore , the theoretical uncertainties are smaller than in dijet cross sections . figure  [ fig1]b shows the inclusive - jet cross section as a function of @xmath5 for different jet radii , @xmath16 .",
    "the measured cross sections are well described by the nlo predictions .",
    "the experimental uncertainties are @xmath17 .",
    "a value of @xmath0 has been extracted from the inclusive - jet cross section with @xmath18 for @xmath19 2 , @xmath20 the experimental uncertainties are dominated by the jet energy scale uncertainty , which amounts to @xmath21 and the theoretical uncertainties include the terms beyond nlo ( @xmath22 ) , the uncertainties coming from the proton pdfs ( @xmath23 ) and the hadronisation corrections ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this determination constitutes the most precise at hera due to the advantages of using inclusive - jet cross sections at high @xmath5 , with a total theoretical uncertainty of only @xmath25 .",
    "the inclusive - jet cross section in photoproduction has been measured  @xcite as a function of @xmath26 ( see fig .  [",
    "for these processes , transverse energies of up to @xmath27 gev are accessible .",
    "the measured cross section shows a steep fall - off of more than five orders of magnitude within the measured range .",
    "the uncorrelated experimental uncertainties are @xmath17 at low @xmath26 and increase to @xmath28 at high @xmath26 .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty due to higher orders is @xmath29 , and the uncertainties due to the parameterisations of the proton and photon pdfs are @xmath30 .",
    "the hadronisation corrections are @xmath31 with an uncertainty of @xmath32 .",
    "the lo calculation underestimates the data by @xmath33 for @xmath34 gev , whereas the nlo calculation gives a very good description of the data within the measured range .",
    "the determination of @xmath0 from inclusive - jet cross sections in photoproduction has an additional uncertainty coming from the photon pdfs , but at the high @xmath26 covered by the measurements , the contribution from resolved processes is reduced and so this uncertainty is of the same order as that coming from the proton pdfs .",
    "therefore , this determination of @xmath0 is also one of the most precise at hera , @xmath35    ( 20.0,6.5 ) ( 0.5,0.0 ) ( 3.5,0.0 ) ( 8.5,0.0 ) ( 2.0,-0.3)*(a ) * ( 6.0,-0.3)*(b ) * ( 11.5,-0.3)*(c ) *    the dijet ( three - jet ) cross sections in nc dis have been measured  @xcite as a function of @xmath5 in the breit frame for events with at least two ( three ) jets of @xmath36 gev and @xmath37 , in the kinematic range given by @xmath38 2and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the inelasticity .",
    "events with a dijet ( trijet ) invariant mass @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) gev were selected .",
    "figure  [ fig2]a shows the ratio of the trijet to the dijet cross section as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "the data are compared to the predictions of nlo qcd using different values of @xmath3 .",
    "this comparison shows the sensitivity of the observable to the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the measured ratio is described well by the predictions .",
    "this ratio is well suited to determine @xmath0 at low @xmath5 since the correlated experimental and theoretical uncertainties cancel partially in the ratio .",
    "therefore , this observable provides an accurate test of color dynamics at low @xmath5 , since the theoretical uncertainty of the ratio is of the same order as at higher @xmath5 . from the measured ratio of trijet to dijet cross sections in the range @xmath43 2 ,",
    "a value of @xmath0 has been extracted , @xmath44 with only @xmath17 uncertainty coming from higher orders at these low values of @xmath5 .",
    "an independent method to extract @xmath0 has been developed which relies on the detailed description of the internal structure of the jets by pqcd .",
    "the internal structure of jets can be studied by means of the integrated jet shape , which is defined as the average fraction of the jet transverse energy that lies inside a cone in the @xmath45 plane of radius @xmath46 concentric with the jet axis .",
    "the integrated jet shape has been measured  @xcite in nc dis in the kinematic region given by @xmath12 2  for jets of @xmath47 gev and @xmath37 .",
    "figure  [ fig2]b shows the measurements of the mean integrated jet shape as a function of @xmath26 for a fixed value of @xmath48 .",
    "the measured integrated jet shape increases as @xmath26 increases . the experimental uncertainties and the corrections for detector and hadronisation effects are small for @xmath48 .",
    "the nlo qcd calculations give a very good description of the data and show the sensitivity of this observable to the value of @xmath3 .",
    "the extraction of @xmath0 from the internal structure of jets gives a value with one of the smallest experimental uncertainties and negligible theoretical uncertainty coming from the pdfs , but , on the other hand , the theoretical uncertainty from the higher orders increases to about @xmath49 .",
    "the value obtained is @xmath50    a fit to inclusive dis data , such as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c , and jet data has been performed  @xcite to extract simultaneously the proton pdfs and @xmath0 .",
    "conventionally , proton pdfs parameterisations are extracted by fitting inclusive dis data , which are directly sensitive to the quark content of the proton ; the gluon density is extracted via scaling violations and sum rules . on the other hand , jet cross sections are directly sensitive to both the quark and gluon densities and to @xmath3 , with the processes @xmath51 not coupled to the gluon density .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of jet cross sections in the fit constraints significantly the gluon density and allows an extraction of @xmath3 from structure functions which is not strongly correlated to the gluon density .",
    "the value obtained from such a fit is @xmath52 which yields a very precise determination of @xmath3 from zeus data alone .",
    "( 20.0,5.0 ) ( -0.2,0.5 ) ( 6.2,0.5 ) ( 10.5,-0.2 ) ( 2.5,-0.3)*(a ) * ( 8.0,-0.3)*(b ) * ( 11.5,-0.3)*(c ) *    figure  [ fig3]a shows a summary of the values of @xmath3 mentioned above together with other determinations done at zeus .",
    "all these values are in agreement with each other and with the world average  @xcite .",
    "the experimental uncertainty for the determinations presented here ranges from @xmath53 to @xmath54 , whereas the theoretical uncertainty is between @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the value with the lowest theoretical uncertainty is that extracted from the inclusive - jet cross sections in nc dis .",
    "to make a proper average of the determinations of @xmath3 from the zeus and h1 collaborations , the correlations among the different determinations has to be taken into account .",
    "the experimental contribution to the uncertainty due to that of the energy scale of the jets , which is the dominant source in the jet measurements , is correlated among the determinations from each experiment . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the uncertainty coming from the proton pdfs is certainly correlated whereas that coming from the hadronisation corrections is only partially correlated . the uncertainty coming from terms beyond nlo",
    "is correlated up to a certain , a priori unknown , degree ; since these uncertainties are dominant , special care must be taken in the treatment of these uncertainties when making an average of the determinations of @xmath3 at hera .",
    "a conservative approach has been used to make the average  @xcite in which the known correlations among the determinations of @xmath0 coming from the same experiment were taken into account ( `` correlation method '' ) .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties arising from terms beyond nlo were assumed to be ( conservatively ) fully correlated .",
    "error - weighted averages were obtained separately for the zeus and h1 measurements .",
    "finally , a hera average was obtained by using the error - weighted average method on the zeus and h1 averages , assuming the experimental uncertainties to be uncorrelated and taking the overall theoretical uncertainty as the linear average of its contribution in each experiment .",
    "the average of the hera measurements and its uncertainty are  @xcite : @xmath57 with an experimental ( theoretical ) uncertainty of @xmath58 .",
    "this average , together with the individual values considered , is shown in fig .",
    "it is found to be in good agreement with the world average ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) , which does not include any of these determinations .",
    "the zeus collaboration has tested the pqcd prediction of the energy - scale dependence of the strong coupling constant by determining @xmath0 from the measured differential jet cross sections at different scales  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig3]c shows the determinations of the energy - scale dependence of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath26 or @xmath59 .",
    "the determinations are consistent with the running of @xmath0 as predicted by pqcd over a large range in the scale .",
    "the determinations of @xmath60 from the h1 and zeus collaborations at similar @xmath26 have been combined  @xcite using the correlation method explained above .",
