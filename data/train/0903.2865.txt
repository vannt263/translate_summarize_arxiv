    "the kondo effect was first observed in the 1930 s while measuring the resistivity of `` pure '' metals . upon lowering the temperature one finds a minimum in the resistivity of nonmagnetic metals containing a small concentration of magnetic impurities . when lowering the temperature even further the resistivity increases and saturates at a finite value at zero temperature .",
    "systematic experimental and theoretical analysis showed that this effect is due to a screening of the impurity spin by resonant scattering of conduction band electrons leading to an enhanced electron density around the impurities . bypassing electrons scatter off these so called spin compensation clouds leading to an enhancement of the resistivity .",
    "the kondo model has become a paradigm model for strong - coupling impurity physics in condensed matter theory@xcite .",

    "the system can be described using linear response theory . however , for @xmath1 linear response theory starting from the equilibrium ground state is no longer applicable .    in this paper",
    "we study a quantum dot in the kondo regime ( kondo dot ) with an applied magnetic field @xmath2 in the regime @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the dc - voltage bias and @xmath5 the temperature .",
    "we diagonalize the hamiltonian using infinitesimal unitary transformations ( flow equations ) @xcite . unlike in conventional scaling approaches",
    "the high energy states are not integrated out , instead the states are successively decoupled from large to small energy differences . since all energy conserving processes are retained , the steady current across the dot turns out to be included in the scaling picture .",
    "this current generates a decoherence rate @xmath6 that cuts off the logarithmic divergences arising in the kondo problem , thereby making the situation @xmath3 a weak - coupling problem .",
    "previous renormalization group ( rg ) calculations@xcite already established that decoherence effects due to spin relaxation processes play a key role in non - equilibrium .",

    "previous non - equilibrium perturbation theory calculations@xcite for the magnetization derived the correct high voltage / temperature @xmath11 behavior , but important logarithmic corrections in non - equilibrium are missing . using the flow equation approach up to two - loop order we will be able to calculate the magnetization including its leading logarithmic corrections consistently in the whole weak - coupling regime .",
