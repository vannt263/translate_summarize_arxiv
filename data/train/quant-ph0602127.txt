    "quantum entanglement has undoubtly represented one of the most peculiar aspects of quantum mechanics as it can be viewed as the furthest departure of quantum world from the classical one @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the last years , entanglement has been recognized as the resource for quantum information processing @xcite . in this context",
    "a growing interest in continuous - variables entanglement is arising for various physical phenomena , such as binary collisions between unbound or trapped particles , photoionization of atoms in both weak and strong fields , and photodissociation of molecules , where the entangled subsystems are spatially separated @xcite . for binary collisions a particular attention has been devoted to the dynamical creation of entanglement between the two particles , stemming from the possibility of using such a system to investigate the foundations of quantum mechanics itself : it has been shown that an almost maximal violation of bell s inequality can occur @xcite .",
    "the quest for quantum - computing capable devices has also produced great interest in entanglement formation in solid state systems where decoherence effects , mainly due to carrier - carrier scattering , play a dominant role @xcite .",
    "in particular these effects have been studied in the context of electron transport in semiconductors , where the time evolution of the entanglement of spatial degrees of freedom has been calculated numerically for scattering events between two distinguishable charged particles by means of the von neumann entropy of the density matrix reduced on the spatial degrees of freedom of one of the particles @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that the distinguishability of the two particles greatly simplifies the system modelling and that it is representative of only few of the collision events taking place in semiconductors , as an electron - hole scattering . indeed",
    "the notion of entanglement for quantum systems composed of distinguishable particles has been widely investigated from the theoretical and experimental point of view @xcite , while relevant questions arise for systems of identical particles ( both bosons and fermions)@xcite . here , in particular , unlike the distinguishable particles case , the hilbert space of the physical states does not have a naturally selected structure of tensor product , because of the symmetrization postulate .",
    "for example , in the analysis of a scattering event between particles , this implies that the system wavefunction can never be factorized in the product of two one - particle wavefunctions .",
    "this makes difficult to give a straightforward definition of entanglement because of the presence of the correlations due to the exchange symmetry .",
    "only recently the problem has been deeply analyzed for fermion systems .",
    "various approaches have been proposed in literature @xcite , each of one having its own advantages and drawbacks , and no consensus has been reached on which one is the most suitable @xcite . here",
    "we follow the one introduced by schliemann @xcite and recently reexamined and extended by other authors @xcite , since it allows to use a density matrix in the spatial coordinates and to compute the von neumann entropy by means of a generalization of the numerical procedure already developed for the case of distinguishable particles .",
    "such an approach is based on an analogous of the schmidt decomposition for state vectors of two fermionic particles : through an unitary transformation the antisymmetric wavefunction is expressed into a basis of slater determinants with a minimum number of non - vanishing terms . this number , known as _ slater rank _ , is a criterion to identify whether a system is entangled or not , which involves the evaluation of the von neumann entropy of the one - particle reduced density matrix . in this notation",
    "the von neumann entropy becomes not only a measure of the uncertainty due to the impossibility of attributing a definite state to each particle of the couple but also of the amount of uncertainty deriving from the indistinguishability of particles .",
    "however it is well known that the quantum correlations related to exchange simmetry can not be used to violate bell s inequality and are not a resource for quantum information processing @xcite : they can not therefore be considered as a manifestation of _ genuine _ quantum entanglement .",
    "the basic significance of a quantitative evaluation of particle - particle entanglement comes also from the link between quantum correlations and decoherence @xcite .",
    "the latter is , in fact , a manifestation of the former when one drops the exact quantum description of the whole system , considering a part of it as the _ environment _ , thus tracing out its quantum coordinates . in our case",
    "one can think of one of the particles as representing the environment . as a consequence",
    "the amount of entanglement determined by the proposed simulative approach is a direct measure of the decoherence undergone by a carrier as a consequence of a carrier - carrier scattering .    in the present paper we aim at calculating entanglement of both spatial and spin degrees of freedom by studying , via a time - dependent numerical analysis , 1d and 2d models of a scattering event between two electrons in semiconductors .",
    "the two particles , explicitly considered as indistinguishable , interact through a coulomb potential .",
    "this approach allows us to overcome the hypothesis of distinguishabilty of the particles used in previous works @xcite . in the present case",
    "quantum entanglement must be analyzed more carefully in order to single - out the effects of the additional correlation induced by indistinguishability .",
    "we also evaluate the role of the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "we believe that our results can be a valuable guideline for the use of collision events of identical particles in the quantum information processing based on solid state systems and for the estimation of the decoherence rate induced by carrier - carrier scatterings .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ rte ] we describe the method used to quantify entanglement in two - fermion systems . in sec .",
    "[ rte1d ] we investigate the entanglement dynamics for the case of a couple of electrons travelling in two parallel , single - mode , quantum wires ( 1d - system ) and in sec .",
    "[ rte2d ] the same analysis is performed for a scattering event between a free propagating and a bound electron in a single - mode two - dimensional electron gas ( 2d - system ) . finally in sec .",
    "[ rtec ] we comment the obtained results and draw conclusions .",
    "here we shall briefly describe the notion of entanglement between two fermions and the approach used for its evaluation , following the theory formulated by schliemann @xcite .",
    "any pure two - fermion state can be written as : @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the elements of a complex and antisymmetric ( @xmath2 ) matrix @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the number of modes for each single particle .",
    "@xmath5 is the creation(annihilation ) operator of a fermion in the @xmath6-th mode .",

    "this decomposition is unique and we can write @xmath14 where the fermionic state is given in terms of new creation operators defined from @xmath15 . in other words",
    "one can think of the unitary transformation @xmath8 as acting on the fermionic operator @xmath16 . the number of @xmath13 different from zero is the slater rank and",
    "is closely related to the entanglement : the state @xmath17 is considered non entangled if its slater rank is equal to 1 , while it must be considered a genuinly entangled state if its slater number is greater than 1 . in fact",

    "( [ elio ] ) that only in the first case @xmath17 can be obtained by antisymmetrization of the product of the single - particle states .    it has been shown recently that the von neumman entropy , commonly used in the context of non - identical particles , is still a good quantum - correlation measure for identical particles @xcite . from the two - particle density matrix @xmath18 , we can get the one - particle reduced density matrix ( normalized to unity)@xcite @xmath19 } { \\textrm{tr}[\\rho_{f}{\\sum_\\mu}a_{\\mu}^{\\dag}a_{\\mu}]}=(w^{\\dag}w)_{\\nu,\\mu}.\\ ] ] in terms of the coefficients @xmath20 the normalization condition becomes @xmath21 , while the von neumman entropy @xmath22 can be computed from : @xmath23=\\ln{2}-2\\sum_{i=1}^{n}|z_{i}|^{2}\\ln{2|z_{i}|^{2}}\\ ] ] where , as stated before , @xmath24 are the eingenvalues of the matrix @xmath25 . for identical particles the von neumann entropy reaches its minimum value @xmath26 in the case of non entangled states ,",
    "whose slater rank is 1 , while , for distinguishable particles , the minimum value of the entropy , still corresponding to non entangled states , is zero .",
    "this behavior can be explained if we consider the real meaning of the von neumman entropy , that must be interpreted as a measure of the lack of knowledge about the state of a quantum system .",
    "the value @xmath27 for non entangled two - fermion states measures the uncertainty arising from the indistinguishability of the particles ; in this case the correlations are only related to exchange simmetry and can not be used as a resource for quantum information . on the other side when the von neumann entropy is greater than @xmath27",
    "there is an additional ignorance about the state of one of the two particles , stemming from genuine entanglement .",
    "the physical system consists of two electrons running in opposite directions along two parallel silicon quantum wires .",
    "the dynamics of the two particles is 1d and is coupled through coulomb potential , so that the hamiltonian of the system takes the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 can be expressed as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the electron charge , @xmath32 is the silicon dielectric constant , @xmath33 and @xmath34 the electron coordinates along the wires and @xmath35 the distance in the perpendicular direction @xmath36 between the two wires .",
    "we use the approximation of single parabolic band and do not consider spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the two quantum wires have been considered as 1d - systems .",

    "this property , due to the fact that such states are factorizable , remains true also during the time evolution since the hamiltonian does not include spin terms .",
    "this implies that at any time @xmath59 the triplet and singlet can always be factorized in a position - wire term and a spin term .",
    "therefore we can attribute the offset of the entanglement value to the lack of knowledge about the spin state , in the sense that one can not make precise claims about the spin state of the particle in a given position - wire state @xmath60 or @xmath61 @xcite .      in our approach",

    "firstly we note that @xmath56 and @xmath57 have the same entropy : this depends on the fact that the one - particle reduced density matrix @xmath132 results to be the same in the two cases .",
    "secondly we observe that the matrix @xmath133 can be viewed as a block diagonal matrix with 2 blocks of dimension @xmath4 .",
