    "the forces of electromagnetic origin that arise between electrically neutral , unpolarized but polarizable objects are commonly known as dispersion forces @xcite .",
    "they were first addressed within the context of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) by casimir and polder @xcite , who showed that they may be attributed to the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field . in accordance with the different nature of the interacting objects",
    ", one may distinguish between three types of dispersion forces , namely the forces between atoms  in the following referred to as van der waals ( vdw ) forces , the forces between atoms and macroscopic bodies  in the following referred to as casimir - polder ( cp ) forces , and the forces between macroscopic bodies  in the following referred to as casimir forces .",
    "dispersion forces play a major role in the understanding of many phenomena , and they can be a useful or disturbing factor in modern applications . apart from being crucial for the understanding of many structures and processes in biochemistry @xcite ,",
    "they are responsible for the remarkable climbing skills of some gecko @xcite and spider species @xcite ; the construction of atomic - force microscopes is essentially based on dispersion forces @xcite , while they are also responsible for the problem of sticking in nanotechnology @xcite . in particular ,",
    "cp forces between atoms and macroscopic bodies are needed for an understanding of the adsorption of atoms and molecules to surfaces @xcite ; they can be used in atom optics to construct atomic mirrors @xcite , while they have also been found to severely limit the lifetime of atoms stored on atom chips @xcite .",
    "the study of cp forces which were first predicted for the idealized situation of a ground - state atom interacting with a perfectly conducting plate @xcite has since been greatly extended .",
    "various planar geometries like the semi - infinite half space @xcite , plates of finite thickness @xcite , two - layered plates @xcite or planar cavities @xcite have been treated , the most general planar geometry being the planar multilayer system with an arbitrary number of layers @xcite .",
    "systems with spherical @xcite or cylindrical symmetries @xcite have also been considered .",
    "it should be mentioned that some theoretical approaches ( in particular , those based on normal - mode quantization , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) require a separate treatment for each specific geometry , whereas others ( in particular , the methods based on linear response theory , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) lead to general expressions that are geometry - independent .",
    "recently , the problem has been studied within the frame of macroscopic qed in dispersing and absorbing media and an exact derivation of a general expression for the cp force has been given @xcite .",
    "although the problem of calculating cp forces ( or equivalently , the respective cp potentials ) is thus formally solved , explicit evaluation requires knowledge of the ( classical ) green tensor for the body - assisted electromagnetic field , which is ( analytically ) available only for a very limited class of geometries .",
    "in particular , inhomogeneous bodies or bodies of exotic shapes have not yet been treated .",
    "nevertheless , it shall be demonstrated in this paper that the general solution  in combination with a born expansion of the green tensor  may serve as a starting point for the systematic study of a wide class of geometries .",
    "furthermore , the born expansion helps making general statements about two fundamental issues regarding cp forces .",
    "first , it may answer the question of whether and to what extent cp forces are additive .",
    "second , it can be used to clarify the microscopic origin of cp forces .",
    "it is known that up to linear order in the electric susceptibility the force between an atom and a macroscopic body that may be regarded composed of atom - like constituents can be obtained by summation of two - atom ( microscopic ) vdw forces @xcite ; an analogous relation between the casimir force and cp forces can be established @xcite .",
    "it is also known that pairwise summation fails at higher order in the susceptibility @xcite , where many - atom interactions begin to play a role @xcite ; in fact , it has been shown that an infinite series of many - atom interactions must be included in order to derive the cp force between an atom and a semi - infinite dielectric half space microscopically @xcite .",
