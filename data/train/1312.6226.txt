    "such an operation is a generalization of the experimental scheme proposed to study the bosonic canonical commutation in optical fields @xcite . using an analysis of quasi - probability functions , quadrature squeezing and sub - poissonian statistics , we have recently shown that such gsp operations introduces nonclassicality in single - mode coherent and thermal states @xcite .",
    "the experimental scheme to implement the gsp operation using linear optical devices and parametric down - converters has been illustrated and mathematically explained in ref .",
    "however , the feasibility of such a scheme is reliant on the efficiency with which photon addition and subtraction can be experimentally achieved .",

    "it is known that gsp operations can be suitably manipulated to generate nonclassical output states when applied on single- and two - mode coherent , thermal and squeezed vacuum states @xcite .",
    "hence , the primary motivation of the present article is to analyze the nonclassicality introduced by the gsp operations from a quantum information perspective and investigate if the generated nonclassicality can enhance the performance of specific quantum information tasks .",
    "these nonclassical optical states , in mode _ a _ , can then be converted into two - mode entangled states by interacting with a secondary mode _ b _ , via a linear optical device such as a 50:50 beam - splitter . for a single - mode input state ,",

    "we note that the generated entanglement is characteristic of the nonclassicality of the gsp operated state , as beam - splitters do not generate entanglement for classical inputs @xcite .",

    "the main results obtained in our investigation can be summarized in the following points :  1 ) at low field intensities , the gsp operation can be suitably tuned to generate highly entangled two - mode discrete level optical states for both single- and two - mode coherent , thermal and squeezed input states .",
    "this is a signature of the nonclassicality generated by the gsp operation on these input states .",
    "2 ) these two - mode entangled states can be used as quantum channels in cv quantum teleportation of single - mode coherent and squeezed states , under the bk protocol .",
    "3 ) we observe that while the average fidelity of cv teleportation is enhanced for the squeezed input states under gsp operations , the fidelity does not rise above the classical threshold for coherent and thermal inputs .",
    "this shows that the generated nonclassicality in coherent and thermal states , under gsp operations , is not resourceful for cv teleportation .",
    "4 ) investigating further , we observe that the gsp operations do not enhance the nonclassicality of coherent and thermal input states in terms its phase - quadrature or the epr correlations , which is crucial for gaining an advantage in cv teleportation .",
    "interestingly , the above results show that though gsp operations introduce nonclassicality and discrete level entanglement for all input states , the injected nonclassicality is not resourceful for cv teleportation when the input state is coherent or thermal , as it fails to enhance the epr correlations .",
    "the real advantage is observed only when the input state is already nonclassical , such as the squeezed state .",

    "<S> we investigate the states generated in continuous variable ( cv ) optical fields on operating them with a number - conserving operator of the type @xmath0 , formed by the generalised superposition of products of field annihilation ( @xmath1 ) and creation ( @xmath2 ) operators , with @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> such an operator is experimentally realizable and can be suitably manipulated to generate nonclassical optical states when applied on single- and two - mode coherent , thermal , and squeezed input states . at low intensities </S>",
    "<S> , these nonclassical states can interact with a secondary mode via a linear optical device to generate two - mode discrete entangled states , which can serve as a resource in quantum information protocols . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of these operations are tested by applying the generated entangled states as quantum channels in cv quantum teleportation , under the braunstein and kimble protocol . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that , under these operations , while the average fidelity of cv teleportation is enhanced for the nonclassical channel formed using input squeezed states , it remains at the classical threshold for input coherent and thermal states . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that though these operations can introduce discrete entanglement in all input states , it enhances the einstein - podolosky - rosen ( epr ) correlations only in the nonclassical squeezed state inputs , leading to an advantage in cv teleportation . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that nonclassical optical states generated using the above operations on classical coherent and thermal state inputs are not resourceful for cv teleportation . </S>",
    "<S> this investigation could prove useful in efficient implementation of noisy non - gaussian channels , formed by linear operations , in future teleportation protocols .    </S>",
