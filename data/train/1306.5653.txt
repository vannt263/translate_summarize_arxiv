    "the beam circulating in the ring can lose energy due to various effects , among which we can highlight as the most important : synchrotron radiation , the resistive impedance of the accelerator , and the interaction between the beam and the electron cloud .",
    "this energy loss is compensated by the rf system by synchronous phase shift . to achieve this , in the absence of acceleration ,",
    "the synchronous phase shift @xmath0 from the stable phase ( @xmath1 for the lhc being above transition ) should be : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the energy loss per turn and per particle and @xmath4 is the rf voltage amplitude .",
    "the synchronous phase can therefore be used to calculate the bunch energy loss and the total energy loss of the beam .",
    "the energy loss per particle by synchrotron radiation does not depend on the total intensity , but on the energy of the particle and its bending radius , so it gives a constant phase offset for all bunches . in the case of the energy loss per particle due to broad - band resistive impedance ,",
    "it depends on the bunch intensity and length .",
    "if bunch intensities and lengths are similar for all bunches and change only slightly during the fill , a phase offset is also similar for all bunches but it can be different from fill to fill depending on the beam parameters .",
    "finally , the energy loss due to electron cloud depends on bunch intensities and lengths , bunch and batch spacings , and the electron cloud generated by the passage of the previous bunches as well as uncaptured beam .",
    "the synchronous phase can be therefore used to calculate the energy loss due to electron cloud if the offset given by the other factors is removed  @xcite .",
    "to separate the synchronous phase shift due to electron cloud from beam loading effects , the beam phase module  @xcite from the lhc low level rf was used .",
    "this module measures the synchronous phase as the difference in phase between the beam and the vector sum of the voltage in the 8 cavities .",

    "the signal from a 3  ghz band - width pickup is fed into a strip - line comb filter transforming a single ( bunch ) pulse into a wavelet at 400.8 mhz lasting for 9 rf periods .",
    "the output is the beam signal input to the beam phase module .",
    "the second rf input is the vector sum of the eight cavity antenna signals with delays to compensate the time of flight between cavities .",
    "two analog in - phase / quadrature ( i / q ) demodulators transform the beam signal and cavity sum into ( i , q ) pairs with respect to the local oscillator ( lo ) ( 400.8 mhz ) .",

    "the voltage at the flat bottom was 3.5  mv , while it was set up to 6  mv in 2011 .",
