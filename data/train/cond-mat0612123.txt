    "the scattering of two particles with sufficiently low kinetic energy is determined by their s - wave _ scattering length _ , which is commonly denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "the energies of the particles are sufficiently low if their de broglie wavelengths are large compared to the range of the interaction .",
    "the scattering length @xmath0 is also the most important interaction variable for 3-body systems and for higher @xmath1-body systems if all their constituents have sufficiently low energy .",
    "generically , the scattering length @xmath0 is comparable in magnitude to the range @xmath2 of the interaction : @xmath3 . in exceptional cases",
    ", the scattering length can be much larger in magnitude than the range : @xmath4 . such a _ large scattering length _ requires the fine - tuning of a parameter characterizing the interactions to the neighborhood of a critical value at which @xmath0 diverges to @xmath5 .",
    "if the scattering length is large , the atoms exhibit properties that depend on @xmath0 but are insensitive to the range and other details of the short - range interaction .",
    "we will refer to these properties as _ universal _ , because they apply equally well to any nonrelativistic particle with short range interactions that produce a large scattering length .    in the 2-body sector , the universal properties are simple but nontrivial .",
    "for example , in the case of equal - mass particles with @xmath6 , there is a 2-body bound state near the scattering threshold with binding energy @xmath7 .",
    "the corrections to this formula are parametrically small : they are suppressed by powers of @xmath8 .    in the 3-body sector , the universal properties are much more intricate .",
    "the first strong evidence for universal behavior in the 3-body system was the discovery of the _ efimov effect _ by vitaly efimov in 1969 @xcite . in the _ resonant limit _",
    "@xmath9 , there is a 2-body bound state exactly at the 2-body scattering threshold @xmath10 .",
    "efimov showed that in this limit there can also be infinitely many , arbitrarily - shallow 3-body bound states whose binding energies @xmath11 have an accumulation point at @xmath10 .",
    "they are called _",
    "efimov states_. as the threshold is approached , the ratio of the binding energies of successive efimov states approaches a universal constant . in the case of identical bosons , the asymptotic ratio is @xmath12 the universal ratio in eq .",
    "( [ r - resonant ] ) is independent of the mass or structure of the identical particles and independent of the form of their short - range interactions .",
    "the efimov effect can also occur in other 3-body systems if at least two of the three pairs have a large s - wave scattering length .",
    "the numerical value of the asymptotic ratio may differ from the value in eq .",

    "efimov s discovery was at first greeted with some skepticism .",
    "however the theoretical evidence for the efimov effect quickly became conclusive .",
    "the efimov effect proved to be just the first nugget from a gold mine of universal aspects of the 3-body problem .",
    "this system has universal properties not only in the resonant limit @xmath13 , but whenever the scattering length is large compared to the range @xmath2 . in two brilliant papers in 1971 and 1979 @xcite , efimov derived a number of universal results on low - energy 3-body observables for three identical bosons .",
    "the dependence of these results on the scattering length or the energy is characterized by scaling behavior modulo coefficients that are log - periodic functions .",

    "efimov physics_.    although the existence of efimov states quickly became well - established theoretically , their experimental confirmation has proved to be more challenging .",
    "although more than 36 years have elapsed since efimov s discovery , there has still not been any convincing direct observation of an efimov state .",
    "one promising system for observing efimov states is @xmath14he atoms , which have a scattering length that is more than a factor of 10 larger than the range of the interaction .",
    "calculations using accurate potential models indicate that the system of three @xmath14he atoms has two 3-body bound states or trimers .",
    "the ground - state trimer is interpreted by some ( including the authors ) as an efimov state , and it has been observed in experiments involving the scattering of cold jets of @xmath14he atoms from a diffraction grating @xcite .",
    "the excited trimer is universally believed to be an efimov state , but it has not yet been observed .",
    "the rapid development of the field of cold atom physics has opened up new opportunities for the experimental study of efimov physics .",
    "this is made possible by two separate technological developments .",
    "one is the technology for cooling atoms to the extremely low temperatures where efimov physics plays a dramatic role .",
    "the other is the technology for controlling the interactions between atoms . by tuning the magnetic field to a feshbach resonance ,",
    "the scattering lengths of the atoms can be made arbitrarily large .",
    "both of these technological developments were crucial in a recent experiment that provided the first indirect evidence for the existence of an efimov state @xcite .",
    "the signature of the efimov state was a resonant enhancement of the loss rate from 3-body recombination in an ultracold gas of @xmath15cs atoms .",
    "this experiment is just the beginning of the study of efimov physics in ultracold atoms .",
    "we have recently written a thorough review of universality in few - body physics with large scattering length @xcite . in this shorter review , we summarize the results derived in ref .",

    "we introduce various scattering concepts that play an important role in efimov physics .",
    "most of this review is focused on identical bosons , because this is the simplest case in which efimov states arise and because it is the system for which efimov physics has been most thoroughly explored . in section  [ sec : uni2 ] and [ sec : uni3 ] , we summarize the universal features of identical bosons with a large scattering length in the 2-body and 3-body sectors , respectively . in section  [ sec : deep ] , we describe the effects of deep diatomic molecules on the universal results . in section  [ sec : appatom ] , we describe applications to @xmath14he atoms and to alkali atoms near a feshbach resonance . in section  [ sec : beyond ] , we discuss the conditions under which efimov physics arises in systems other than identical bosons . in section  [ sec : beyondsl ] , we consider the corrections to the universal results from the nonzero effective range and from microscopic models of the atoms as well as the extension of universality to 4-body systems .",

    "if the relative momentum @xmath48 of two atoms is sufficiently small , their de broglie wavelengths are larger than the spacial extent of the atoms and they are unable to resolve each other s internal structure .",
    "their interactions will therefore be indistinguishable from those of point particles .",
    "if the atoms interact through a short - range potential with range @xmath2 and if the relative momentum of the two atoms satisfies @xmath49 , then their de broglie wavelengths prevent them from resolving the structure of the potential .    for real atoms ,",
    "the potential is not quite short - range .",
    "the interatomic potential @xmath50 between two neutral atoms in their ground states consists of a short range potential and a long - range tail provided by the van der waals interaction : @xmath51 the van der waals tail of the potential does not prevent the scattering amplitude from being expanded in powers of the relative momentum @xmath52 , but at 4@xmath53 order the dependence on @xmath52 becomes nonpolynomial .",
    "the coefficient @xmath54 determines a length scale called the van der waals length : @xmath55 at sufficiently low energy , the interactions between atoms are dominated by the van der waals interaction .",

    "to both be unnaturally large would require the simultaneous fine - tuning of two parameters in the potential .",
    "the natural low - energy length scale @xmath58 also sets the natural scale for the binding energies of the 2-body bound states closest to threshold .",
    "the binding energy of the shallowest bound state is expected to be of order @xmath60 or larger .",

    "this fine - tuning can be due to fortuitous values of the fundamental constants of nature , in which case we call it _ accidental fine - tuning _ , or it can be due to the adjustment of parameters that are under experimental control , in which case we call it _ experimental fine - tuning_. we will give examples of atoms with both kinds of fine - tunings .",

    "they predict that @xmath14he atoms have a single 2-body bound state or _",

    "the scattering length of @xmath14he atoms is large because of an _ accidental fine - tuning_. the mass of the @xmath14he nucleus , the electron mass , and the fine structure constant @xmath68 of qed have fortuitous values that make the potential between two @xmath14he atoms just deep enough to have a bound state very close to threshold , and therefore a large scattering length .",
    "if one of the @xmath14he atoms is replaced by a @xmath69he atom , which decreases the reduced mass by 14% without changing the interaction potential , the scattering length has the more natural value @xmath70 .",

    "the mechanism for generating a large scattering length that involves tuning the depth or range of the potential is called a _",

    "this requires a second _ closed channel _ in which scattering states are energetically forbidden that is weakly coupled to the open channel .",
    "a large scattering length for particles in the open channel can be generated by tuning the depth of the potential for the closed channel to bring one of its bound states close to the threshold for the open channel .",

    "the sensitivity to short distances enters primarily through the scattering length and other constants that describe low - energy scattering .",
    "this motivates a more phenomenological approach in which the interactions are described by a _ scattering model _ , which can be specified by a parameterization of low - energy scattering amplitudes .",

    "@xcite for the special case of @xmath14he atoms were also reproduced .",
    "a drawback of their analysis is the focus on the deepest 4-body state only .",
    "it remains to be seen whether their findings are universal or just artefacts of their regularization of the renormalized zero - range model .",
    "vitaly efimov s discovery in 1970 of the efimov effect in identical bosons was like finding a nugget of a precious metal .",
    "other physicists quickly verified the amazing properties of this nugget and tried to find similar nuggets in other systems .",
    "efimov went on to show that the nugget came from a rich vein of ore corresponding to universal properties of 3-body systems with a large scattering length .",
    "he pointed out that the efimov effect was just a hint of a discrete scaling symmetry , and showed how the discrete scaling symmetry could be exploited to mine the ore .",
    "however not many physical systems in which efimov physics plays an important role were found . in those that were identified , such as @xmath14he atoms , it was difficult to study efimov physics experimentally .",
    "efimov s mine was eventually closed due to lack of interest from other physicists as well as the lack of a market for the ore .",
    "the new field of cold atom physics has changed the situation dramatically .",
    "the development of the technology for trapping alkali atoms and cooling them to ultralow temperatures has provided a long list of 3-body systems in which efimov physics can be studied .",
    "especially important is the possibility of using feshbach resonances to control the scattering length and make it arbitrarily large .",
    "this development has justified the reopening of efimov s mine .",
    "the theoretical study of efimov physics is still in its infancy . in the case of 3 identical bosons ,",
    "the rates for most of the basic scattering processes have been calculated only at threshold .",
    "they can be used to make universal predictions for cold atoms at sufficiently low temperatures . to determine the efimov parameters @xmath103 and @xmath565 accurately and to test the accuracy of the universal predictions , it is important to have universal predictions for rate constants as a function of temperature .",
    "this requires the calculation of the rates for the basic scattering processes as functions of the collision energy .",
    "the only such calculation thus far is the s - ware atom - dimer phase shift at collision energies up to the dimer break - up threshold @xcite . for 3-body systems other than identical bosons that also exhibit the efimov effect ,",
    "the universal results for the basic scattering processes have not even been calculated at threshold .",
    "the calculation of range corrections is important for improving the accuracy of universal predictions and also for quantifying their domain of validity .",
    "although methods for calculating range corrections have been developed , they have not been implemented in a way that allows them to be easily applied to experiment .",
    "the calculation of 3-body observables in microscopic models for atoms near feshbach resonance would also be useful for determining the range of validity of the universal predictions .",
    "if the theoretical study of efimov physics is still in its infancy , the experimental study of efimov physics is a newborn .",
    "the beautiful results on @xmath15cs atoms from the innsbruck group have provided the first glimpse of efimov physics in cold atoms .",
    "these experiments have demonstrated that efimov physics can have dramatic effects in alkali atoms in spite of their many deep 2-body bound states .",
    "they inspire confidence that efimov physics will also be observable in other cold atom systems .",
    "the next milestone in the experimental study of efimov physics in cold atoms will be quantitative tests of the correlations between 3-body observables predicted by universality .",
    "for example , if @xmath0 is large and positive , universality gives correlations between atom - dimer scattering and 3-body recombination .",
    "if a feshbach resonance is used to tune the scattering length through @xmath5 , universality gives correlations between 3-body recombination at large positive @xmath0 on one side of the resonance and 3-body recombination at large negative @xmath0 on the other side of the resonance .",
    "the ultimate confirmation of efimov physics would be the experimental verification of the discrete scaling symmetry .",
    "this could be accomplished by the observation of loss features in 3-body recombination or in atom - dimer scattering at two or more values of @xmath0 that differ by powers of the discrete scaling factor . for 3-body recombination with identical bosons ,",
    "the large size of the discrete scaling factor 22.7 and the @xmath496 scaling of the loss rate makes this difficult .",
    "atom - dimer scattering is more favorable in this regard because the loss rate scales only as @xmath0 .",
    "verification of the discrete scaling symmetry would be easier in a system consisting of two heavy atoms and a third light atom because the discrete scaling factor can be much smaller than that for identical bosons .",
    "one particularly favorable possibility is the system consisting of two @xmath15cs atoms and a @xmath566li atom near a feshbach resonance in the cs - li interaction .",
    "this system has a discrete scaling factor of only 4.88 @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the efimov effect in 1970 provided a hint of the remarkable phenomena associated with efimov physics that was waiting to be uncovered . for 35 years",
    "the study of efimov physics was an almost exclusively theoretical enterprise that could be characterized as an exploratory mine shaft .",
    "the advent of cold atom physics made it inevitable that efimov physics would also be studied experimentally .",
    "this field offers a long list of systems in which efimov physics could occur , as well as offering the possibility of tuning the scattering length experimentally .",
    "an experimental mine shaft into efimov physics has finally been opened by the innsbruck experiment on @xmath15cs atoms .",
    "this should stimulate the opening of mine shafts into efimov physics in other cold atom systems .",
    "extensive experimental effort to extract the ore and additional theoretical effort to refine the ore will be required to reveal the full beauty of efimov physics .",
