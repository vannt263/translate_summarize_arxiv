    "nonequilibrium phenomena in interacting many  body systems have recently drawn significant attention .",
    "one of the most intriguing challenges is to understand how a system responds to an external electric field and to unravel the microscopic mechanism that gives rise to a constant current and a steady increase of the total energy of the system . from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "a non  linear current  voltage characteristics with a threshold behavior is well  established ,  @xcite and recently the appearance of a regime of negative differential resistivity has been observed in several interacting systems .",
    "@xcite moreover , the onset of bloch oscillations ( well  known for the noninteracting systems ) has been observed in different correlated systems at very large electric fields  @xcite and even in the integrable models .",
    "@xcite oscillations in the current response can also exhibit a more complex pattern leading to beats in a certain regime of model parameters .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , the heating arising from the energy flow to the system represents a serious obstacle in calculation of a constant nonzero current for systems at half  filling ,  @xcite therefore most of the calculations investigating current  voltage characteristics have been limited to one dimension .",
    "@xcite one of the widely used concepts is to couple the system to a thermal bath , which at a loss of quantum coherence enables calculations of a quasistationary current .",
    "recently , the influence of coupling to a thermal bath on the current  voltage characteristics of the hubbard model has been investigated .",
    "@xcite the reported influence is similar to the role of quantum phonons on dissipation of the excess energy and consequently on the current  voltage characteristics of the holstein model .",
    "@xcite    a complementary approach to investigation of quantum systems out of equilibrium is to study dynamics of a single carrier propagating in dissipative medium ,  @xcite in particular a charge carrier driven by a constant electric  field .",
    "@xcite such problems have been recently solved for a driven carrier doped into mott insulator  @xcite and a driven carrier coupled to holstein phonons ,  @xcite where the nonzero current arises due to constant emission of magnons and phonons , respectively .",
    "recently , using a state  of  the  art truncated lanczos method  @xcite the quasistationary current in a doped 2d mott insulator coupled to phonons was calculated .",
    "@xcite the advantage of such approaches is reflected in calculation of a stable well - defined current while preserving the full quantum nature of the problem .",
    "in addition , the total energy gained by hopping of a charge carrier along the direction of the electric field is entirely absorbed within the microscopic model .",
    "this idea enables the formulation of the time  evolution of different subsystems without coupling to an external reservoir .",
    "the aim of our study is to extend a recent study of a driven charge carrier coupled to holstein phonons  @xcite to a two  particle problem as described within the hubbard ",
    "holstein hamiltonian .",
    "there are two sources of the particle - particle interaction in this problem : a ) an indirect interaction , mediated by the electron  phonon coupling and b ) the direct on  site coulomb interaction .",
    "this motivates us to address the following questions : _",
    "( i ) _ is it possible to drive a bound pair of electrons out of equilibrium in such way that a finite current is obtained without breaking the pair ? we show that a hubbard ",
    "holstein bipolaron at initial time @xmath0 , driven by a constant electric field , begins to dissociate as soon as a nonzero quasistationary current is reached . _",
    "( ii ) _ how is the quasistationary current calculated per particle changed in a two  electron system with respect to the single ",
    "electron case ?",
    "_ ( iii ) _ we analyze beats in the transient current response .",
    "we show that the beats in our model emerge if the energy scale associated with the bloch oscillations within the quasiparticle ( qp ) band coincides with the energy gap between the qp band and the low  energy continuum of excited states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "previous studies@xcite have shown the importance of the low - energy spectrum for the short  time behavior of the interacting systems after switching on the static electric field . in terms of short  time dynamics there",
    "exist at least three distinct energy scales .",
    "first is the binding energy of the bipolaron @xmath49 representing the energy required to dissociate a bound bipolaron into two separate polarons , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the energies of a bipolaron and a polaron , respectively .",
    "the second is the phonon frequency @xmath53 , the third is the gap in the excitation spectrum @xmath54 separating the top of the bipolaron band from either the continuum of states or the excited bipolaron band . due to the existence of a finite gap , there exists a threshold field @xmath55 separating the adiabatic regime for @xmath56 and a dissipative regime with a finite current at @xmath57 , see also refs .",
    "characteristic features of the adiabatic regime are periodic bloch oscillations as the bipolaron moves along the bipolaron band . as a consequence , a time  averaged current in the adiabatic regime is zero . on the other hand , in the dissipative regime a quasistationary state",
    "is reached after a short transient time @xmath58 .",
    "a quasistationary state is characterized by a constant time ",
    "independent current @xmath59 and a linear growth of the total energy of the system , @xmath60 in the case of a driven polaron it has been shown that the steady increase of @xmath61 is entirely due to the increase of phonon excitations left in the wake of the traveling polaron.@xcite    a reasonable conjecture in the case of the bipolaron is that for a large binding energy , _",
    "i.e. _ , for @xmath62 , the system on short time scale propagates as a bound bipolaron , depositing the excess energy in the form of excited phonons left in its wake .",
    "our calculations show that in the weak coupling regime ( @xmath63 ) the bipolaron dissociates on a time scale much shorter than @xmath64 .",
    "we therefore focus in the following on the intermediate and strong coupling regimes ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively ) , where the propagation of a bound pair under the electric field is more likely .",
    "however , as we shall show , such propagation is not observed in our calculations , instead , the bipolaron begins to dissociate as soon as the system enters the dissipative regime with a finite electric current .    in this section",
    "we focus on @xmath67 .",
    "the motivation for choosing @xmath65 and @xmath47 is that the binding energy is smaller than @xmath53 ( @xmath68 ) for @xmath65 while for @xmath47 it is much larger than @xmath53 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "we also note that in the case of @xmath47 there exists an excited bound state at @xmath70 above the ground state at @xmath71 .",
    "this state represents a bound state of the bipolaron with excited phonon cloud .",
    "similar bound excited states have been well - studied for the case of the holstein polaron .",
    "@xcite they form dispersive bands just below the one - phonon continuum that starts at @xmath53 above the ground state energy .    for @xmath65 and electric field @xmath72",

    "the focal result of our work is that in the dissipative regime the bipolaron dissociates into two separate polarons . by examining different parameter regimes we realized that the appearance of a finite quasistationary current is closely connected with the dissociation of the bipolaron .",
    "even though our calculations were limited to large @xmath12 and short propagation times , our results strongly suggest that bipolaron has a finite lifetime as long as the system displays a non - zero @xmath77 .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the calculation of @xmath104 that in the large - time limit tends to a constant , largely independent of @xmath12 .",
    "this result demonstrates that the dissociation and the appearance of the quasistationary current emerge simultaneously as the system evolves from a transient regime to the quasistationary state .",
    "here we should comment that due to dispersionless phonons the bipolaron can gain energy when two particles occupy the same site , but to achieve a non - zero quasistationary current charged particles have to start hopping along the direction of electric field , and in doing so breaking the bound pair . in ref .",
    "@xcite the green function study at finite temperature ( without electric field ) calculated the bipolaron dissociation time , which goes to zero for dispersionless phonons , while this is not the case for phonons with dispersion .",
    "for the problem studied here this may indicate that phonons with dispersion would not always lead to dissociation of bipolaron as soon as a finite quasistationary current is obtained .",
    "further research in this field is necessary to resolve the issue .    a linear time ",
    "dependence of a real  space expansion of particle densities or related quantities has been observed in several recent nonequilibrium problems .",
    "@xcite even though we study a two  particle problem on an infinite lattice and we do not deal with a well  defined thermalization , we can consider a cloud of emitted phonon excitations as a subsystem with an elevated effective temperature .",
    "the quantum monte carlo study  @xcite of the thermal dissociation of the hubbard ",
    "holstein bipolaron provides evidence that a bipolaron dissociates as the temperature becomes comparable to the binding energy @xmath49 . in comparison ,",
    "our results indicate that the bipolaron dissociates as soon as a finite net current appears around @xmath105 .",
    "this occurs even in the case of @xmath146 , which is realized for @xmath47 in our calculations , see fig .",
    "[ fig2](h ) .",
    "we have also checked the time dependence of systems at even larger electron - phonon coupling , up to @xmath147 . with increasing @xmath116",
    "the qualitative behavior remains the same , the bipolaron as well dissociates with the dissociaton time that is increasing with @xmath116 and the threshold field is also roughly exponentially increased as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eq_curr](c ) .",
    "yet another noteworthy finding reveals that the quasistationary current per particle is in case of the dissociated bipolaron smaller than in the single polaron case since the velocity of one particle is diminished due to the scattering on phonons generated by the motion of the other particle .",
    "comparison of the bipolaron @xmath77@xmath12 characteristics at @xmath47 with the polaron case ( not presented ) shows that a quasistationary current of bipolaron is not always lower than that of the polaron , which is possibly a consequence of remnant correlations between particles due to the incomplete dissociation of the bipolaron in the transient regime .    to summarize",
    ", we have demonstrated the dissociation of the bipolaron under the influence of the electric field .",
    "this result predicts that as long as a given dilute system of bipolarons can be described by the short range hubbard model in 1d and the on - site coupling term between the charge density and the dispersionless phonons , bipolarons do not carry electric current , instead they dissociate into separate polarons as soon as the electric field is strong enough to yield a finite current .",
