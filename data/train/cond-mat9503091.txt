    "a classical problem of chemical engineering is the understanding of particulate two - phase flows , in which a continuous fluid constitutes one component and a discrete particle phase the other .",
    "the practical importance of understanding such a particle laden flow is evidenced by its central role in geophysical phenomena like sand storms , dune formation , or sediment transport , by the importance of biological questions like the understanding of the flow properties of blood , or cell component separation techniques as ultracentrifugation , by industrial applications as diverse as pneumatic transport in tubes , catalytic cracking , biological and chemical reactors , solid fuel rocket motors , fluidized beds , sedimentation , filtration and many more  @xcite .    if the discreteness of the particulate phase is fully taken into account then the mathematical formulation of the flow problem involves ( i ) a field equation for the continuous liquid phase  in most cases the navier - stokes equation , subject to a set of boundary conditions both on the container walls and the surfaces of the suspended particles  and ( ii ) a set of differential equations for the time evolution of the degrees of freedom of the individual constituents of the particulate phase . due to the extremly complicated boundary conditions and the nonlinearity of the underlying equations , an analytical solution to this problem is impossible , except for exceptionally simple cases . a numerical treatment , however , even with simplifying assumptions , still poses tremendous practical problems .",
    "several simulation techniques have been developed which we briefly review here .",
    "( a ) finite volume techniques that implement no - slip boundary conditions on the surface of each particle have been employed for very few particles .",
    "the treated reynolds numbers  @xcite are in principle only limited by the grid resolution and the computation time available .",
    "similarly , ( b ) lattice boltzmann techniques for the liquid equation have been used to simulate up to @xmath0 suspended particles  @xcite .",
    "so far , these have come closest to provide realistic simulations of two - phase flows with many particles .",
    "most other approaches involve certain assumptions that are only true in limited parameter ranges : one important class of algorithms uses the stokesian dynamics technique  @xcite valid for low reynolds number flow to ( c ) obtain the flow field consistent with no - slip boundary conditions @xcite or to ( d ) approximate the particles as being point like  @xcite .",
    "\\(e ) more popular in the engineering sciences , but less rigorous are continuum approximations that involve two sets of continuum equations , one for the liquid phase and one for the particulate phase .",
    "the boundary conditions on the particle surface and their influence on the flow is then represented by local drag forces depending on the solid volume fraction and local velocity differences  @xcite . in these approaches there",
    "are remaining open questions in the determination of the proper constitutive equation for the solid and the momentum exchange between the phases .",
    "\\(f ) to circumvent some of these later problems of the pure continuum approaches , algorithms have come into fashion that combine a discrete element  @xcite or molecular dynamics description  @xcite of the particles with a continuum equation for the liquid as in ( a ) , but use a drag term to couple the two phases as in the pure continuum formulations ( e )  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will describe an algorithm of type ( f ) .",
    "such a method allows immediate access to basically all physically relevant quantities in the system , including particle coordinates and both particle and liquid velocities , at computational costs comparable to a `` standard '' real space wavier - stokes integration .",
    "the main drawback is that a neglect of the proper boundary conditions in the treatment of the liquid will result in an inaccurate rendering of the short scale flow properties .",
    "since , however , our main focus will be the ability of the algorithm to describe collective phenomena , i.e. , the effects that arise when the number of particles is large , we do not have the ambition to describe accurately the local flow fields on the scale of the particle size . at the moment",
    "the detailed effects of neglecting certain aspects of the local flow are not clear to us .",
    "nevertheless we want to see which and how some collective phenomena emerge directly from simple modeling assumptions  as opposed to using semi - empirical expressions as , e.g. , done in refs.@xcite .",
    "in particular , we rely on the fact that the long - range hydrodynamic interactions , which we presume to be the most important for collective phenomena , are correctly represented by the velocity and pressure fields according to the navier - stokes integration under consideration of an additional field representing the particle density .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give a detailed description of the simulation algorithm that we use to model particulate two - phase flow and its validation in the cases of ( i ) flow through a `` porous medium '' consisting of the `` particles '' in the simulation which are kept at fixed positions and ( ii ) of particles that undergo sedimentation in a suspension under the influence of gravity . in section [ s : model ]",
    "we will first describe a two - dimensional implementation of the algorithm .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ s : application ] , we discuss first the case ( i ) of flow through a porous medium ( sec .",
    "[ s : porous - media ] ) and second the case ( ii ) of sedimenting particles ( sec .",
    "[ s : sedimentation ] ) .",
    "we aim at a simulation of macroscopic , hard sphere particles that interact on contact when the interstitial fluid plays no important role . in addition",
    ", they interact over long - range hydrodynamic forces , mediated by an incompressible fluid medium between the particles . for the moment",
    ", we consider a two - dimensional implementation of our project .",
    "since the analytic aspects of the solution of the navier - stokes equation in two dimensions are very different from the three dimensional solution , we expect at best a qualitative agreement to the features of real three dimensional flows . however , we feel justified to study the two - dimensional problem if it is possible to find qualitative knowledge on that way .",
    "we organize the description of our algorithm into three main parts . in the first section we describe details of the employed molecular dynamics technique for the particulate phase .",
    "the second compiles the fundamental equations for the liquid phase and the details of their solution . in the third section we elaborate on the particle - liquid interaction",
    "each particle @xmath1 in the simulation is characterized by its radius @xmath2 we take the particle size distribution to be slightly polydisperse with the radii @xmath3 drawn from a gaussian distribution @xmath4 with mean @xmath5 , which is cut off at its standard deviation @xmath6 , @xmath7 ,                               & \\mbox { if}\\quad |r/\\bar{r } -1|",

    "thus we describe the particle motion only by the coordinates of their center of mass @xmath10 although the particle centers are constrained to lie in the @xmath11 plane , we will assume  for reasons that we address in sec .",
    "[ s : model : coupling ]  that the particles can otherwise be regarded as three dimensional .",
    "therefore we associate with each particle a mass @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the constant particle density .",
    "we consider the following forces to be acting on particle @xmath1 , @xmath14 here , @xmath15 is the sum of all forces on @xmath1 , the @xmath16 are forces due to the presence of the boundary , the term proportional to @xmath17 accounts for particle weight and buoyancy .",
    "the drag force @xmath18 will be discussed in sec . [",
    "s : model : coupling ] .",
    "the sum runs over the other particles in the system , but is effectively restricted to the neighborhood of particle @xmath1 , since we will only introduce short range interparticle forces in radial ( @xmath19 ) and and tangential ( @xmath20 ) direction in the next two sections .",
    "container walls , if present , manifest themselves by elastic forces and frictional forces in analogy to those acting between two particles",
    ". we will use for them the equations that result from those for two collision partners  to be introduced below  in the limit of the other particle having infinite mass and radius .    in direction of @xmath17",
    ", we account for the weight of the particles .",
    "acting opposite to gravity , we add the buoyancy reaction of the liquid , which equals the weight of the displaced fluid of constant density @xmath21 .",
    "our coordinate system is chosen such that @xmath17 points in @xmath22 direction .",
    "the forces from eq .",
    "( [ e : ftot ] ) enter the equations of motion for the particulate phase , @xmath23 we solve this coupled system employing a fourth order predictor - corrector algorithm as described , e.g. , in  @xcite .      at very low reynolds numbers the lubrication forces between particles play an important role .",
    "since they have a divergent character when the particles come close , particles in principle do not touch in this regime .",
    "however , if the fluid in the system is a gas or the particle based reynolds numbers are not any longer small or if the particles are assumed to have some surface roughness , then they will touch and we have to model the contact forces between them .    if no fluid were present then the particles are force free unless they touch , whereupon strong repulsive and dissipative forces act between them , resulting from the viscoelastic properties of the particles . to model these forces",
    ", we here use contact models frequently employed in granular matter research  @xcite .",

    "@xmath26 of the particles .",
    "if the overlap is positive , then @xmath27 here , @xmath28 denotes the unit vector pointing from the center of particle @xmath1 to the center of particle @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the stiffness of the contact , which we assume to be constant . for realistic contacts in 3d",
    "is not a trivial matter .",
    "the value of @xmath31 depends on the exact physical processes governing the contact and thus in general both on material constants as the young modulus @xmath32 or the poisson number @xmath33 and the geometry of the particles .",
    "many researchers use the nonlinear hertzian contact theory , in which @xmath34 .",
    "for equal sized spheres , the hertzian theory gives @xmath35 we refer the reader to the tables [ t : flow ] and [ t : sed ] for values used in the simulations .",
    "] as mentioned above the force vanishes if the particles do not overlap , i.e. , @xmath36    to take the dissipative character of the contact into account , we add a velocity dependent friction term to the elastic restoring force .",
    "this damping force shall also act in the direction of the line connecting the particle centers ( the _ normal _ direction ) and be proportional to the normal relative particle velocity . on inclusion of this term",
    ", we obtain for the contact force @xmath37 in normal direction , @xmath38 in this relation , @xmath39 is the reduced mass @xmath40 of the pair in contact and @xmath41 determines the strength of the dissipation .",

    "it can be solved analytically for the velocity after the contact @xmath44 since energy is dissipated , the ratio of these velocities is less than one ; its value is termed _ restitution coefficient _ @xmath45 .",

    "the lubrication force damps the relative motion of the particles very strongly and diverges when the particles touch .",

    "furthermore , we remove the divergence at @xmath55 by adding to the value of @xmath56 in the denominator a small positive number @xmath57 .",
    "we have used a value of @xmath58 other than just being a numerical contrivance our physical motivation is found in the unavoidable surface roughness of particles in reality , which may cause the particle to come into contact despite the lubrication force .",

    "this procedure is based on the idea that the local violation of the continuity equation , i.e. , the value of the left hand side of eq .",

    "fast access to the latter is crucial for the calculation of the particle - liquid interaction . moreover ( iii ) , only the chosen coarseness of the spatial and temporal discretization limits the range of reynolds numbers addressable in the simulation .",

    ", one could think maybe of an approach to decompose the liquid equation into an equation for the average flow and additional equations describing the fluctuations around it , in the spirit of turbulence modeling @xcite .",
    "the main problem in simulations of multiphase flow that try to bypass the specification of boundary conditions on the phase boundaries is to specify an expression for the momentum exchange between fluid and particulate phase . even for a single sphere",

    "a `` pure '' 2d simulation should , strictly speaking , be one of rigid , parallel _",
    "cylinders_. however , at a fixed small reynolds number , the drag per unit length of a cylinder @xcite does not depend on its radius .",
    "this behavior is very different from the observations in 3d experiments , where there is a strong dependence of the drag on the size of the spheres .",

    "popular expressions for @xmath140 include ( i ) the half - empirical carman - kozeny relation @xmath146 and ( ii ) the phenomenological rumpf - gupte form @xmath147 both relations are only valid in an intermediate range of porosity and do not apply to the limit of very high porosity or very low solid volume fraction , where one expects @xmath148 to leading order for the following reasons . for a strongly `` dilute '' random medium , let us consider the solid as independent spherical `` defects . ''",
    "each defect exerts the stokes force @xmath149 on the fluid , where @xmath150 is the interstitial fluid velocity .",

    "the simulation data compares very favorable with this prediction for the whole range of simulated effective 3d porosities @xmath157 please note that ( [ e : stokes - drop ] ) has no adjustable parameters .",
    "the agreement is surprising considering the rather crude assumptions that we have made .",
    "in contrast , the carman - kozeny formula predicts the pressure drop to vanish quadratically as @xmath158 , and the rumpf - gupte formula predicts even a constant pressure drop for @xmath158 .",
    "however , both formulas are applicable only in the intermediate or low porosity regime so that the lack of agreement with ( [ e : stokes - drop ] ) is not surprising .",
    "we now discuss the application of our algorithm to the more general case when both particles and liquid are mobile and important dynamical consequences arise from the coupling of the two phases . a prototype example for this case",
    "is batch settling sedimentation .",
    "imagine a homogeneous mixture of particles and liquid being placed into a quadrilateral  or for our purposes rectangular  container and being initially at rest .",
    "if there exists a density difference between particles and liquid , then gravitational driving forces will set the particles in motion .",
    "complicated fluid - mediated hydrodynamic interactions between the particles lead to convoluted trajectories and give rise to collective phenomena as for example anisotropic self diffusion of particles .",

    "one denotes as the hindered settling function @xmath162 the ratio of the sedimentation velocity @xmath163 to the stokes velocity @xmath164 , @xmath165 where @xmath166 which is the settling velocity of an isolated sphere in an infinitely extended fluid .",

    "furthermore , we choose the particle size large enough such that the effects of brownian motion may be neglected , corresponding to the regime of high ( iii ) peclet number . we have performed simulations and determined the settling velocity as a function of the solid fraction of the particle suspension .",
    "the following four different sets of conditions for `` thought '' experiments have been performed to assess the role and importance of lubrication and backflow for the simulations . in particular ,",
    "simulation series    * includes lubrication effects [ eq . ( [ e : lubrication1 ] ) ] , effects of particle void fraction [ eqs . ( [ e : nse],[e : ce ] ) ] , and periodic boundary conditions in @xmath89 direction , perpendicular to gravity ; * differs from series ( i ) only in the respect that we have not considered the lubrication term ( [ e : lubrication1 ] ) . without these lubrication forces ,",

    "( [ e : fn1 ] ) such that for pair collisions a restitution coefficient of @xmath173 results [ cf . eq .",
    "( [ e : restitution ] ) ] ; * differs from ( ii ) in the respect that we have additionally set the liquid fraction @xmath124 to @xmath77 , as if the particles consisted of liquid and not of a separate solid phase",
    ". the interaction of particle and liquid phase results only from the pointlike frictional drag between the two .",
    "* differs from ( i ) only in the respect that we have used no - slip boundary conditions at @xmath174 and @xmath175    figure [ f : sed - vel ] displays the hindered settling function of case ( i ) .",
    "the `` stokes '' velocity used to normalize the data has been obtained from simulations of single spheres .",
    "in addition , we have plotted a theoretical expression ( [ e : hindered_settling ] ) , @xmath176 , which we will discuss later in the text ( sec .",
    "[ s :- problems ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that experiments in the viscous regime  both @xmath177 and @xmath178 much smaller than @xmath77  often report a correlation with a @xmath179 dependence @xcite , the richardson - zaki formula @xcite .",
    "it may be that in our case the larger value of @xmath180 prevents us from seeing @xmath181 .",
    "of course , also the nature of hydrodynamic interactions in 2d is quite different from the 3d case , such that probably only full 3d simulations see @xmath182 @xcite .",
    "the graphs in figure [ f : sed - rat ] address the question in which way the resulting sedimentation velocities in series ( ii ) to ( iv ) differ from that in ( i ) . to this end",
    ", we have calculated the ratios of the sedimentation velocities .",
    "first , the symbol ( @xmath183 ) denotes the ratio @xmath184 . since lubrication alters the interactions between particles more significantly when the particle fraction is high , we see that the fraction deviates more and more from @xmath77 as the solid fraction increases . the ratio becomes smaller than @xmath77 which means that the system `` without '' lubrication sediments slower .",
    "we understand this behavior taking into account the strongly damping character of the lubrication force .",
    "such damping forces between particles have the effect to reduce the _ relative _ velocity between them and thus to favor the creation of loosely connected particle agglomerates .",
    "these effects are well known for `` dry '' granular systems with dissipative contact interactions between particles collisions  @xcite .",
    "these particle clusters then trap some liquid within and fall as almost coherent units .",
    "such a unit displays a larger stokes velocity than its constituent particles since @xmath164 is proportional to the squared radius of the falling object .",
    "second , we assess the effect of backflow in the simulation by setting @xmath185 in the navier - stokes and the continuity equation ( [ e : nse],[e : ce ] ) .",
    "the particles are then effectively point - like as far as the fluid is concerned . denoted by @xmath186 ,",
    "the ratio @xmath187 starts at a value below one  which results from particularities in the momentum exchange modeling ( see sec .",
    "[ s :- problems ] )  and increases with volume fraction . we can estimate the effect of backflow by assuming that the average relative velocity of particles and liquid phase are the same in situations ( ii ) and ( iii ) : a short calculation assuming that the average relative velocity between particles and liquid is the same in both cases predicts @xmath188 the observed increase is less steep as expected from this relation indicating a more complicated effect as consequence of the introduction of the volume fraction field , which we do not understand at this point .",
    "third , we have performed a simulation with no - slip boundary conditions on the container walls instead of the periodic boundary conditions used otherwise .",
    "we denote the data points for @xmath189 by the symbol @xmath183 .",
    "the ratio is , apart from a point at very low volume fraction , smaller than one .",
    "the liquid velocity is constrained to be zero at the container walls and hence we believe that altogether the motion of the liquid is less vehement than in the periodic case . since particle and liquid motion are very strongly coupled  the distance that a particle has to travel in order to reach a terminal velocity is much less than a particle diameter  the on average smaller particle velocities at the container walls suffice to slow down the settling .      at this point it is interesting to note that the functional forms proposed both for the volume fraction dependence of the mean settling velocity in the sedimentation problem and for the pressure drop in the problem of flow through random media ( the rumpf - gupte relation ) are probably not independent from each other .",
    "more precisely , it is possible to relate the formulas for the pressure drop in flow through a random medium and the settling velocity in the sedimentation problem . during the sedimentation process , one observes two shock fronts in the suspension .",
    "one front separates the densely packed particle assembly at the bottom of the vessel from the bulk of the suspension , the other the bulk from the leftover clear fluid region at the top .",
    "if the particles were frozen in their instantaneous positions by compensating the forces acting on them , then the pressure drop between these two shock fronts is just the hydrostatic pressure drop of the pure liquid . in an infinitely extended system",
    ", time averaged , each particle experiences a total force equal to the difference of its weight and buoyancy .",
    "if the particles move freely then an additional pressure difference between the two shock fronts arises because now the liquid must support the particles .",
    "therefore , in steady state , the arising pressure difference must just equal the difference of particle weight and buoyancy , i.e. , @xmath190 here @xmath191 denotes the height difference within the two mentioned shock fronts over which the pressure drop is measured .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the particles were immobile , we could apply a drag formula of the form introduced in sec .",
    "[ s : porous - media ] for flow through random media , say @xmath192 to find the pressure drop @xmath193 let in this case @xmath150 denote the average relative velocity of liquid and particles .",
    "then we find that @xmath194 there is no net flux of material ( liquid plus particles ) through an arbitrary horizontal cross section of the suspension .",
    "thus , if the particles settle , a net upward flux of fluid with velocity @xmath195 results .",
    "the average relative velocity of particles to liquid is therefore @xmath196 we now equate the expressions ( [ e : dp1 ] ) and ( [ e : dp2 ] ) , substitute @xmath197 and solve for @xmath198 : @xmath199 here , we have replaced the liquid volume fraction @xmath136 by the solid volume fraction @xmath200 we obtain the dimensionless hindered settling function @xmath201 by division of this equation by @xmath164 , @xmath202    for example , if we insert the functional form of @xmath203 found in eq .",
    "( [ e : stokes - drop ] ) for the regime of stokes flow and high dilution we obtain for the hindered settling function , @xmath204 for the description of experimental data one often uses the phenomenological richardson - zaki correlation  @xcite , @xmath205 where @xmath92 takes values around @xmath206 theoretical arguments by batchelor @xcite lead to the expression @xmath207 for small @xmath160 .    for comparison with the simulation results we have plotted relation ( [ e : hindered_settling ] ) in fig .",
    "[ f : sed - vel ] as solid line .",
    "the major advantage of a drag - force based algorithm as described here for the simulation of two - phase flows is the capability to simulate considerably large systems with relatively moderate computational requirements . at the same time",
    "one gets without efforts a physical behavior of the particulate phase circumventing the problems of continuum approaches with stress or the constitutive equation of the particulate phase .",
    "such an algorithm is therefore a tool to obtain quick insight into collective effects of many particles .",
    "in fact , most of the known physical effects appear to be reproducible using only a very simple expression for the momentum exchange between phases .",
    "we list now some of the problems that we have encountered performing the present study that will be addressed in future research .",
    "let us first consider the behavior of a single particle in an otherwise resting liquid , both initially at rest .",
    "if the particle density is higher then the density of the liquid , the particle will experience a net force in direction of gravity .",
    "as it falls , liquid will be dragged down with it in accordance with the momentum exchange rules and the requirements of the replacement of liquid as the local liquid fraction changes . as compared to the liquid velocity far away from the particle",
    "the local velocity is closer to the particle velocity .",
    "consequently the isolated particle experiences a drag force which does not agree with the theoretical stokes expression into which the particle velocity and the liquid velocity at infinity enter and the resulting terminal fall velocity of the particle is larger than the theoretical stokes velocity .",
    "one way to address this problem is to alter the drag law ( [ e : stokes ] ) by introducing a `` drag - coefficient '' different from @xmath208 and dependent on the , albeit unphysical , ratio of particle size to the grid - spacing and physical parameters as the reynolds number  this approach has been taken in @xcite .",
    "however , the root of this problem lies in the treatment of the momentum exchange and indicates that a revision of its treatment is necessary .",
    "one could imagine first that a better treatment of the momentum exchange should proceed along the lines of approximating the liquid stress tensor on the particle surface , which may be possible in the low reynolds number regime .",
    "however , the principal limitation of our _ ansatz _ is that the flow velocities in the vicinity of the particle surface are not accurately rendered as required for an estimation of the stress on the particle , since we account for the flow only in an average sense .",
    "another possibility is to change the drag law .",
    "we have so far employed a simple stokes expression .",
    "it is probably necessary to introduce a drag expression which additionally depends on the local particle density in addition to the local velocity difference between phases .",
    "we think that at least at high particle densities also particle rotation becomes important and must be included into the model .",
    "moreover , we may have to use density dependent local viscosities in the `` navier - stokes '' equation .    in conclusion , we should and will undertake an improvement of our algorithm to tackle some of the problems listed above in the future .",
    "however , even at the present state , we have a powerful tool at hand to assess cooperative effects of many - particle systems in which hydrodynamic interactions play an important role .",
    "we have successfully modeled flow around impurities at small and moderate volume fractions and found reasonable agreement in the case of a sedimenting system .",
    "we would like to acknowledge in particular long discussions with franois feuillebois , hans herrmann , wolfgang kalthoff , and frank tzschichholz .",
    "we are also grateful for discussions with d. barnea , m. fermigier , i. goldhirsch , e. guazzelli , and j. hinch .",
