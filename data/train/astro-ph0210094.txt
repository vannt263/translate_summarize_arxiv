    "in the currently popular scenario for galaxy formation , pioneered by white and rees ( 1978 ) , the dark haloes of galaxies form hierarchically by the gravitational clustering of non - dissipative dark matter , while the luminous parts form through a combination of gravitational clustering and dissipative collapse ( which may be affected by feedback ) .",
    "the major uncertainty in this scenario concerns the baryonic component , since the physics of star formation and feedback are very poorly understood at present , thus requiring a parametric approach to the problem .",
    "semi - analytic models of galaxy formation help to explore large regions of the relevant parameter space and have produced quite encouraging results ( e.g. cole et al .",

    "if the number of observables that are successfully reproduced is ( much ) larger than the number of free parameters , it is reasonable to assume that the galaxian histories produced by such models may indeed match the real ones . in that spirit , we have developed a simple approach to disk galaxy evolution , based on i ) a detailed model of the milky way ( used as a prototype , sec .",

    "the main conclusion ( sec .",
    "4 ) is that massive disks have formed the bulk of their stars earlier than low mass ones .",
    "whether this `` star formation hierarchy '' is compatible with the `` dark matter assembly '' hierarchy remains to be demonstrated .",
    "several simple models have been developed in the past few years on the chemical evolution of the milky way disk ( e.g. prantzos and aubert 1995 , chiappini et al .",
    "1997 , boissier and prantzos 1999 , chang et al . 1999 ,",
    "portinari and chiosi 2000 ) . although they may differ considerably in their ingredients ( radial dependence of star formation rate and/or infall rate , inclusion or not of radial inflows , etc . )",
    "these models converge in the following points ( see e.g. discussion in tosi 2000 ) : i ) infall ( of primordial or low metallicity gas ) on a long timescale ( @xmath17 gyr ) is required locally , in order to reproduce the observed g - dwarf metallicity distribution in the solar neighborhood ; ii ) strong radial dependence of the star formation rate and/or the infall rate is needed in order to reproduce the observed radial profiles of gas , sfr and metal abundances [ _ note _ : in recent cosmological hydro - simulations of galaxy formation sommer - larsen et al .",

    "1 displays the results of a simple model , ( from boissier and prantzos 1999 ) which also reproduces all the main observables in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the adopted sfr as a function of radius @xmath4 is of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the rotational velocity at @xmath4 and @xmath7 the gas surface density ; this sfr is based on the assumption that large scale star formation in spirals is induced by the passage of the spiral waves ( wyse and silk 1989 ) .",
    "the model reproduces satisfactorily the observed chemical and photometric radial profiles of the mw disk ( fig .",
    "1 ) as well as those of oxygen and other metal abundances ( hou et al . 2000 ) ; in particular , the model predicts a flatenning of the abundance gradients with time ( due to the assumed inside - out formation of the disk ) , in agreement with the recent observational results of maciel and da costa(2002 ) , based on o abundances of planetary nebulae of various age classes [ _ note _ : taking into account the uncertainties in evaluating ages of planetary nebulae , the importance of that agreement should not be overestimated ; it is , however , encouraging ] .",
    "2 displays the evolution of several observables of a milky way disk as a function of redshift in a `` standard '' cosmology , according to the model .",
    "it appears that such disks evolved with quasi - constant amount of gas and were in the past substantially more compact in the b - band ; they also were slightly brighter in the b - band ( at least at redshifts @xmath0 1 - 2 ) and always fainter in the k - band .",
    "although the model reproduces successfully the present day profiles of the milky way disk , its `` predictions '' for the past history of such disks cannnot be considered very robust , since a degenerate solution ( several different histories leading to the same final state ) can not be excluded . still , it is tempting to explore the consequences of that model , after extending it to other disk galaxies .",
    "assuming that the mw is a typical spiral , one may try to extend the model to the case of other disk galaxies by means of simple scaling relations ( in an analoguous way , the sun is a typical star used to `` calibrate '' models of stellar evolution ) .",
    "the scaling relations derived by mo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in the framework of cold dark matter models of galaxy formation can be used ( boissier and prantzos 2000 , bp2000 ) to describe disks as two - parameter family ( scale length @xmath8 and central surface brightness @xmath9 ) , in terms of the corresponding mw parameters ( represented by subscript g below ) :    @xmath10    and @xmath11 the two fundamental parameters entering these relations are the circular velocity @xmath12 ( a measure of the disk s mass ) and the spin parameter @xmath13 ( a measure of the disk s angular momentum distribution ) ; large @xmath12 values correspond to massive disks and large @xmath13 values to extended ones .",
    "the baryonic fraction @xmath14 of the disks is taken to be 0.05 in our calculations . finally , for the mw parameters we have : @xmath15=2.6 kpc , @xmath16=1150 ,",
    "@xmath17=220 km / s .",
    "note that these scaling relations apply to gaseous disks , assumed to be formed at the redshift of the corresponding dark halo formation ; this formalism is adopted in semi - analytic models of galaxy evolution , where the baryon accretion history ( the `` infall '' history , in our terminology ) is determined essentially by the dark matter accretion history .",
    "a schmidt type law for star formation ( with an efficiency proportional to local dynamical timescale ) is usually assumed in such models , along with some prescription for `` feedback '' ( a term describing the way gas is affected by the energy input from stars ) ; the interplay between the three effects ( accretion , star formation , feedback ) determines the effective star formation efficiency in semi - analytic models .",
    "a different approach is adopted in bp2000 : the star formation law and efficiency a ( eq . 1 ) are kept the same as in the mw model ( with rotational velocity curves properly calculated ) , while the infall rate is adjusted in order to reproduce main properties of present - day spirals .",
    "this approach ( i.e. using present - day properties of galaxies to infer their histories ) has been characterised as `` backwards '' approach to galaxy evolution ( e.g. fereras and silk 2001 ) ; our use of scaling relations borrowed from cold dark matter ( `` forwards '' ) models qualifies our approach rather as a `` hybrid '' one .",
    "in fact , the scaling relations allow to tie the geometric properties of disks to those of the milky way and nothing more ; the overall disk evolution is really determined by the assumed infall ( or mass accretion ) history .    .",
    "each model galaxy is compared to an observed one of approximately equal circular velocity v@xmath18 .",
    "it can be seen that more massive disks are , in general , redder , but also that for similar values of v@xmath18 the value of @xmath13 ( i.e. surface density ) is important for the age ( and colour ) of the stellar population ( from boissier and prantzos 2000 ) .",

    "our `` hybrid '' approach allows us to reproduce successfully a large number of observables of galaxies in the local universe ( bp2000 ) , including : disk sizes and central surface brightness , tully - fisher relations in various wavelength bands , colour - colour and colour - magnitude relations , gas fractions vs magnitude , abundances as a function of local and integrated properties etc ; it also reproduces naturally detailed spectra from the kennicut atlas of galaxies for various galaxy types , as can be seen in fig .",
    "we find that the crucial ingredient of that success is the assumption that gas is infalling more slowly in galaxies with smaller masses and/or surface densities .",
    "these two parameters are the main drivers of disk evolution .",
    "we note that bell and de jong ( 2000 ) and bell and bower ( 2000 ) reach similar conclusions , but they attribute a more important role to local surface density while we find that galaxy mass plays an even more important role : on average , massive disks are older than lower mass ones . disks with @xmath19100 km / s",
    "have formed the first half of their stars within 4 - 9 gyr ( fig .",
    "4 ) , while disks with @xmath19300 km / s have done so within 2 - 6 gyr ( depending on spin parameter , that is surface density , see boissier et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the main observational arguments on which our conclusion is based are presented in fig .",
    "one sees that , on average , massive disks are redder , poorer in gas and richer in metals than less massive ones .",
    "each one of these observables , taken separately , could be easily explained ( e.g. redder colours could be explained by larger amounts of dust , as invoked e.g. in somerville and primack 1999 or avila - reese and firmani 2000 ) . when all three observables are considered together , the idea of a star formation efficiency increasing with galaxy mass apears as a viable explanation .",
    "such a possibility has been invoked in ferreras and silk ( 2001 ) , but it requires huge amounts of ( undetectable ) gas to be present in small galaxies .",
    "however , when the fourth observable is taken into account , namely the absence of any dependence of the present - day star formation efficiency on rotational velocity ( or b - magnitude , see boissier et al .",
    "2001 ) , the only viable explanation is the one invoked above : massive disks are older , on average .",
    "we note that in recent cosmological hydro - simulations nagamine et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find that star formation in small galaxies has stopped many gyr ago , in clear contradiction with observations of local galaxies . on the other hand , van den bosch ( 2002 )",
    "finds that semi - analytical models , even with feedback , produce massive disks that are systematically bluer than their lower mass counterparts , again in contradiction with observations ( fig .",
    "6 ) ; the reason of the failure is obviously related to the fact that the mass accretion histories of baryons are largely dictated by the hierarchical clustering of dark matter ( e.g. avila - reese and firmani 2000 ) . once gas becomes available it forms rapidly stars ; feedback can only delay star formation for a short time ( shorter than the several gyr that are observationally required to obtain small disks bluer than massive ones ) .",

    ", height=188 ]        our simple , `` hybrid '' model for disk evolution , calibrated on the mw , suggests that on average massive disks have formed the bulk of their stars several gyr earlier than low mass ones .",
    "their predictions match successfully most currently available observables , including data from surveys at intermediate redshifts : as shown in boissier and prantzos ( 2001 ) this simple model may account for the lack of evolution in the properties of large disks observed up to @xmath01 by the canada - france - hawaii survey ( lilly et al .",
    "1998 ) : the evolution of large ( and massive ) disks has been achieved mostly before @xmath01 in our senario .",
    "a prediction of our model appears in fig .",
    "the anticorelation between the metal abundance gradient and the inverse b - scalelength , found to be valid locally ( prantzos and boissier 2000)is shown to be valid also at high redshifts : smaller disks are always caracterised by larger ( negative ) abundance gradients .",
    "in the currently popular paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation , low mass dark matter haloes form first , while more massive ones are formed later through accretion and merging ; in principle , baryons are supposed to follow the dark matter , but their fate is largely unknown at present , due to a lack of a reliable theory of star formation ( and feedback ) .    at present , and despite claims to the contrary , there is no satisfactory explanation ( at least , not a published one ) for the observables presented in fig . 5 in the framework of hierarchical galaxy formation . it remains to be shown why star formation in galaxies apparently followed an `` inverted hierarchy '' w.r.t the dark matter asembly .",
    "feedback offers an obvious solution to that problem , but the required delay timescales appear unphysically large . on the other hand , we have shown that simple models based on our ( fairly detailed ) knowledge of the milky way , reproduce most properties of local disks with few parameters ( essentially the infall timescale ) and make interesting predictions for the disk properties at higher redshifts ."
