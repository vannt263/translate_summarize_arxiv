    "in this paper we analyze equilibration of the anisotropic quark - gluon plasma produced by decays of color flux tubes possibly created at the very early stages of ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "our approach is based on the kinetic theory @xcite where decay rates of the initial color fields are given by the schwinger formula and appear as the source terms in the kinetic equations .",
    "the produced quarks and gluons interact with the mean color field and collide with each other .",
    "the collisions are described by the collision terms treated in the relaxation - time approximation @xcite . by connecting the relaxation time with the system s shear viscosity , we are able to study production and thermalization processes in the quark - gluon plasma characterized by different values of the ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density , @xmath3 .",
    "in our numerical calculations we use the values of the parameter @xmath4 which vary between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the values in the range @xmath7 have been extracted from the recent hydrodynamic analyses of ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions studied at rhic and the lhc .",

    ", our lowest value corresponds to the kss ( kovtun - son - starinets ) bound obtained from the black hole physics @xcite .",
    "the proposed model is one dimensional and assumes boost invariance , hence , it may be applied only to the early stages of the collisions and to the central rapidity region .",
    "although similar models have been analyzed before @xcite , our formulation has a few novel features .",
    "first of all , by studying different components of the energy - momentum tensor we can analyze in more detail the way how the system approaches the hydrodynamic limit . in particular , we calculate separately the longitudinal and transverse pressure of the system and study their time dependence . secondly , using different values of the ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density , we may study equilibration of the quark - gluon plasma with reference to recent viscous - hydrodynamics models of ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the use of a constant value for @xmath0 in the kinetic equations implies that the relaxation time becomes a function of an effective temperature of the plasma . as a consequence",
    ", the present work extends earlier frameworks where the relaxation time was treated as a constant , although we do not take into account the non - abelian terms in the field equations or the minijet production , which are included in @xcite or @xcite , respectively .",
    "a general time - dependent relaxation time was used in @xcite , however , without incorporating the color fields .",
    "our approach originates from the color - flux - tube model and transport theory formulated in refs .",
    "at the very initial stage of a nucleus - nucleus collisions a longitudinal chromoelectric field is formed , which decays subsequently via the schwinger mechanism .",
    "such an initial configuration of the field is similar to the glasma state @xcite where both chromoelectric and chromomagnetic longitudinal color fields are present at the very early stages of the collisions .",
    "we note that a similar framework to that presented in this paper has been used recently in ref .",
    "@xcite to study oscillations of the quark - gluon plasma around expanding anisotropic ( color neutral ) backgrounds .",
    "our present approach goes much beyond the framework of ref",
    ". @xcite by solving the coupled kinetic and maxwell equations in the self - consistent manner .",
    "the strength of the initial color fields is chosen in such a way that the effective temperature of the produced plasma reaches realistic values , @xmath9 mev .",
    "for such initial conditions and the kss value of the ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density , i.e. , in the case @xmath1 , the plasma approaches the viscous - hydrodynamics regime within 12 fm / c . on the other hand , for larger values of the viscosity , @xmath2 ,",
    "the collisions in the plasma become inefficient to destroy collective phenomena which demonstrate themselves as oscillations of different plasma parameters .",
    "the presence of such oscillations brings in differences between the kinetic and viscous - hydrodynamics descriptions .",
    "this leads us to the conclusion that after the first 1  fm / c the viscous - hydrodynamics description of the created quark - gluon plasma is quite appropriate if @xmath1 , however , it is not completely satisfactory if @xmath2 . in the latter case the hydrodynamic approach should be extended to include transport phenomena connected with color conductivity . on the other hand",
    ", it is quite interesting to observe that for @xmath10 the plasma might be characterized by an effective viscosity @xmath11 which fluctuates around the fixed value of @xmath0 .",
    "hence , in this case one may consider averaging over different color - flux - tubes which washes out the oscillations in such a way that the averaged system may be effectively well described by the viscous hydrodynamics .",

    "however , it is interesting to observe in the case @xmath175 that although @xmath11 and @xmath0 are different , after 12 fm / c the effective viscosity starts to fluctuate around the constant value corresponding to @xmath0 . in this case",
