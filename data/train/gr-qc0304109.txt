    "the study of the quasi - normal modes ( qnm ) developing outside black holes plays an important role in black hole physics and astrophysics . in virtue of previous works",
    ", we now have the schematic picture regarding the dynamics of waves outside a black hole .",
    "a static observer outside the black hole can indicate three successive stages of the wave evolution .",
    "the first stage is the exact shape of the wave front , which depends on the initial pulse .",
    "this stage is followed by the quasi - normal ringing , which has characteristic frequencies directly connected to the parameters of the black hole .",
    "this quasi - normal ringing is regarded as a direct evidence of the existence of black holes and is expected to be detectable by future gravitational wave detectors . finally , at late time",
    ", the quasi - normal ringing is replaced by a relaxation process , which is known as the wave tails .",
    "wave tail is of interest in its own right since it has various applications from the no - hair theorem to the mass inflation scenario .",
    "quasi - normal modes of massless scalar , electromagnetic , and gravitational fields in asymptotically flat spacetimes have been studied for over thirty years . for a review ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the quasi - normal ringing decays exponentially with time . the oscillation period and the decay time scale",
    "are associated with the real part and the imaginary part respectively of the so called complex quasi - normal frequency @xcite .",
    "the tail phenomenon was first investigated by price @xcite for both schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "it was shown that for an observer at a fixed position the field dies off with a power - law tail .",
    "this behavior was confirmed by numerical studies @xcite .",
    "the evolution of massive scalar field in the asymptotically flat black hole background is also of interest .",
    "recently this topic has attracted a lot of attention @xcite .",
    "the study of wave dynamics is not limited in the asymptotically flat spacetimes .",
    "motivated by the inflation , the quasi - normal modes in de sitter ( ds ) space were studied @xcite .",
    "one of the most significant differences between the qnms in the ds space and the qnms in the asymptotically flat space is that in the ds space the oscillation always decays exponentially , the power - law tail is not in presence .",
    "inspired by the discovery of the ads / cft correspondence , the investigation of the quasi - normal modes in the anti de sitter ( ads ) black hole has been appealing @xcite recently .",
    "it was shown that the decay of the perturbation is always exponential for the ads black holes .",
    "another intriguing aspect of studying qnm has been suggested recently .",
    "it was argued that qnm could be a probe to investigate the quantum properties of black holes .",
    "the first speculation was put forward by hod who pointed out that the qnms of a schwarzschild black hole conform to the existence of the bekenstein - hawking temperature and imply emission in terms of a fixed area quantum @xcite .",
    "this study was subsequently extended to other black holes such as the d - dimensional spherically symmetric black holes @xcite , near extreme schwarzschild - de sitter and kerr black holes @xcite , etc @xcite .",
    "though this kind of consideration is still somewhat speculative , it possibly relates classical , macroscopic properties to quantum information of black holes .",
    "all these previous works on quasi - normal modes have so far been restricted to time - independent black hole backgrounds .",
    "it should be realized that , for a realistic model , the black hole parameters change with time .",
    "a schwarzschild black hole gaining or losing mass via absorption or evaporation is a good example .",
    "the more intriguing investigation of the black hole qnm calls for a systematic analysis of time - dependent spacetimes .",
    "recently the late time tails under the influence of a time - dependent scattering potential has been explored in @xcite , where the tail structure was found modified due to the temporal dependence of the potential .",
    "the motivation of the present paper is to explore the modification to the qnm in the time - dependent spacetimes . instead of putting an effective time - dependent scattering potential by hand as done in @xcite",
    ", we will introduce the time - dependent potential in a natural way by considering dynamic black holes with black hole parameters changing with time due to absorption and evaporation processes .",
    "we will study numerically the temporal evolution of massless scalar field perturbation , especially the qnm in different time - dependent situations .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we first go over the conventional treatment for numerical study of the wave propagation in the stationary black hole background .",
    "we will point out the difficulty if it is to be applied to the time - dependent cases .",
    "then we will introduce a new treatment by employing the kruskal coordinates which we find to be advantageous . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we present the numerical study of the qnm in the time - dependent background . sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] is a brief summary and discussion .",
