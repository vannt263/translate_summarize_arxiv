    "as is known , such physical processes as gravitational collapse and turbulence compression play a key role in creation and evolution of star formation regions over the wide range of scales , from star complexes over ob associations down to compact embedded clusters and to clumps of young stars inside them .",
    "these stellar systems form a continuous hierarchy of structures for all these scales @xcite .",
    "it is suggested that the hierarchy extends up to 1  kpc @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite described at least three categories of hierarchical star groups on the largest levels : ob associations with a length scale @xmath4  pc , stellar aggregates with a length scale @xmath5  pc and star complexes with diameters @xmath2  pc .",

    "if the ambient jeans length is the largest scale , then a combination of gravitational and turbulent fragmentations can drive the whole process . observed star formation rates in galaxies",
    "can follow from such turbulent structures @xcite .",
    "hierarchical clustering disappears with age as stars mix .",
    "the densest regions have the shortest mixing times and lose their substructures first .",
    "nevertheless , very young clusters have a similar pattern of subclustering , suggesting that this structure continues down to individual stars @xcite .",

    "size distribution of all 186 star formation regions of level  1 satisfies a power law with a slope @xmath28 in the range from 50 to 170  pc .",

    "[ figure : fig_fsize ] ) .",
    "note , that the end of the size distribution curve for regions of @xcite coincides with the beginning of the size distribution curve for our 186 star formation regions of level  1 ( fig .",
    "[ figure : fig_fsize ] ) . given that the area studied in @xcite occupies @xmath30 of the area of ngc  628 , which is studied in this paper , we can conclude that ( i ) the number of hii regions identified in @xcite is smaller than the numbers of regions found by @xcite using sextractor , and , that is more important , ( ii ) our measurements of sizes of star formation regions using photometric profiles are in a good agreement with measurements of @xcite .",
    "more interesting behaviour is observed for the curve of size distribution of star formation regions of all hierarchical levels .",
    "it continues the size distribution curve for regions of @xcite at @xmath31  pc and has the same slope @xmath32 in the range from 45 to 85  pc  diameters of ob associations .",
    "flatter slope , @xmath33 , is observed in the range from @xmath34 to @xmath35  pc for regions of level  1 with an extended profile and for the smallest regions of level  2 .",

    ". however , such intermediate young stellar structures are observed in galaxies .",
    "these are stellar aggregates with diameters @xmath39  pc .",

    "bimodal size distributions with a secondary peak at @xmath40  pc were found for associations in smc @xcite , m31 @xcite , ngc  2090 , ngc  2541 , ngc  3351 , ngc  3621 and ngc  4548 @xcite , ngc  1058 and ugc  12732 @xcite , ngc  300 @xcite , ngc  3507 and ngc  4394 @xcite , ngc  7793 @xcite .",

    "however , the question of origin of stellar aggregates is still open .    as we noted above",
    ", the size distribution of star formation regions of all hierarchical levels continues the size distribution of regions of @xcite with the same slope @xmath32 for sizes from 45  pc to @xmath41  kpc .",
    "however , the function of size distribution deviates from a power law with the slope 1.5 at @xmath42  pc and @xmath43  pc ( fig .  [ figure : fig_fsize ] ) .",
    "we believe that the flatter slope in the range of 90 to 180  pc is a result of significant number of star formation regions with a diameter of @xmath44  pc with an unresolved internal structure . taking into account such undetected objects will shift the distribution curve upward along the ordinate axis at sizes smaller than or equal to diameters of these star formation regions .",
    "opposite situation is observed at @xmath45  pc .",
    "largest structures with @xmath46  pc have a low boundary surface brightness .",
    "they are difficult for identification in spiral arms of grand design galaxy ngc  628 because of the significant variations of background level ( see section  4 ) .",
    "underestimation a number of star formation regions at lowest hierarchical levels leads to a drastic drop in the size distribution curve .    in spite of small statistics , largest star formation regions with @xmath47  kpc",
    "are also distributed by size by a power law with @xmath38 .",
    "it can be an additional argument in favor of the assumption of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , who adopted that the hierarchical structures extend to the scale of 1  kpc .",
    "taking into account the hierarchy of star formation regions is crucial for construction of the cumulative size distribution function . neglecting the internal structure of star formation regions of higher hierarchical levels and underestimation of",
    "the number of star formation regions of lower hierarchical levels leads to a decrease or an increase of the slope of the size distribution function , respectively . to illustrate this , we compare size distributions of regions of @xcite , our star formation regions of all hierarchical levels , and our star formation regions of level  1 with any profiles in the range of scale from 50 to 110  pc in fig .",
    "[ figure : fig_fsize ] .    on the scale of 200600  pc , the characteristic sizes of stellar aggregates and complexes , the size distribution function has a constant slope .",
    "we believe that the sample of objects at different levels of hierarchy within this range of scale is complete .",
    "the slope @xmath23 of the cumulative size distribution function for star formation regions is of fundamental importance .",
    "it is associated with the fractal dimension of objects in the galaxy at different scales .",
    "@xcite introduced the fractal of dimension @xmath48 , where @xmath49 .",
    "following @xcite , we believe that the size distribution of stellar groups suggests a fractal distribution of stellar positions projected on the disc of the galaxy , with a constant fractal dimension of @xmath50 in the wide range of length scales from 2  pc to 1  kpc .",
    "it is comparable to the fractal dimension of projected local interstellar clouds , @xmath51 @xcite , and to the fractal dimension of hi ( @xmath52 ) in the m81 group of galaxies @xcite .",
    "we studied hierarchical structures and the size distribution of star formation regions in the spiral galaxy ngc  628 over a range of scale from 50 to 1000  pc based on size estimations of 297 star formation regions .",
    "most star formation regions are combined into larger structures over several levels .",
    "we found three characteristic sizes of young star groups : ob associations with mean diameter @xmath53  pc , stellar aggregates ( @xmath54  pc ) and star complexes ( @xmath55  pc ) .",
    "the cumulative size distribution function of star formation regions satisfies a power law with a slope of @xmath3 at scales from 45 to 85  pc , from 190 to 600  pc , and from 650  pc to 900  pc , which are appropriate to the sizes of associations , aggregates and complexes .",
    "together with the result of @xcite , who found the slope @xmath56 for regions at scales from 2 to 100  pc , our result shows that the size distribution of young stellar structures in the galaxy obeys a power law with a constant slope of @xmath57 at all studied scales from @xmath58  pc to @xmath59  kpc .    ignoring the hierarchical structures ,",
    "i.e. using star formation regions of only one of hierarchical levels to examine the size distribution , gives slopes @xmath60 .",
