    "the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model  @xcite is a theory with one extra dimension ( ed ) in a slice of the ads@xmath5 space - time . in the present paper",
    "we will study the rs scenario with the 5-dimensional planck scale @xmath2 in the tev region and small curvature  @xcite ( se also refs .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath6 it has the following background warped metric : @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 being the `` radius '' of the ed , and @xmath11 is the minkowski metric .",
    "the points @xmath12 and @xmath13 are identified , so one gets the orbifold @xmath14 .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 defines a 5-dimensional scalar curvature of the ads@xmath5 space . in what follows",
    ", we will call it `` _ _ curvature _ _ '' .",
    "we consider rs scheme with two 3d branes located in 5-th dimension at the points @xmath15 ( tev brane ) and @xmath16 ( plank brane ) . if @xmath17 , the tension on the tev brane is negative , whereas the tension on the planck brane is positive .",
    "the sm fields are constrained to the tev brane , while the gravity propagates in all spatial dimensions .",
    "it is necessary to note that metric ( [ metric ] ) is chosen in such a way that 4-dimensional coordinates @xmath18 are galilean on the tev brane where all the sm fields live , since the warp factor is equal to unity at @xmath15 .    by integrating 5-dimensional action in variable @xmath19 , one gets an effective 4-dimensional action which , in its turn , leads to the so - called `` hierarchy relation '' between the 5-dimensional reduced planck mass @xmath20 and 5-dimensional reduced gravity scale @xmath21 : @xmath22 let us notice that @xmath21 and 5-dimensional gravity scale @xmath2 are related as follows : @xmath23 in order the hierarchy relation ( [ rs_hierarchy_relation ] ) to be satisfied , it is enough to take @xmath24 that corresponds to @xmath25 .",
    "thus , no large scales ( of the order of the planck mass ) are introduced .    from the point of view of a 4-dimensional observer located on the tev brane ,",
    "in addition to the massless graviton , there exists an infinite number of its kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations , @xmath26 , with the masses @xmath27 where @xmath28 are zeros of the bessel function @xmath29 .",
    "note that @xmath30 at large @xmath31 .",
    "the interaction of the kk gravitons with the the sm fields on the tev brane is described by the lagrangian : @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the energy - momentum tensor of the matter , and @xmath31 is the kk - number .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 is the physical scale on the tev brane .    in a number of papers ,",
    "the graviton contribution in the drell - yan process was studied in the standard rs model  @xcite , in which @xmath35 ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "in such a scheme , an experimental signature is a real or virtual production of massive kk graviton resonances .",
    "the bounds on the fundamental gravity scale and/or mass of the lightest resonance were obtained both at the tevatron  @xcite and recently at the lhc  @xcite . note that all these bounds significantly depend on a value of another parameter of the model @xmath36 .",
    "the rs model with the small curvature has been checked by the delphi collaboration  @xcite by studying photon energy spectrum in the process @xmath37 _ missing energy_. the following bound was obtained : @xmath38    there are several reasons to consider rs scenario with the small curvature :    * there exists a serious shortcoming of the standard scenario with the curvature and fundamental gravity scale being of the order of the planck mass , @xmath39  @xcite . *",
    "the spectrum of the kk gravitons ( [ graviton_masses ] ) is very similar to that in the model with _",
    "one _ ed  @xcite .",
    "note that matrix elements for the scattering of the sm fields can be formally obtained from corresponding matrix elements calculated in the model with one _ flat _",
    "dimension by using the following replacement  @xcite : @xmath40 here @xmath41 is a 5-dimensional reduced planck scale , @xmath42 being the radius of the extra flat dimension . as a result",
    ", all cross sections appear to be rather large ( as in the add model with @xmath43 dimensions ) .",
    "* at the same time , astrophysical restrictions are not applied to the rs - like model with the small curvature , contrary to the add model with one or two eds  @xcite .",
    "let us consider the dilepton production  @xcite with high transverse momenta , @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "the differential cross section of this process is equal to @xmath46 where @xmath0 is the transverse momenta of the leading lepton , and @xmath47 .",
    "the contribution of the virtual gravitons to the process ( [ process ] ) comes from the quark - antiquark annihilation , @xmath48 , and gluon - gluon fusion , @xmath49 .",
    "the corresponding partonic cross sections are  @xcite : @xmath50 where @xmath51 here @xmath52 denotes a total width of the graviton with the kk number @xmath31 and mass @xmath53 : @xmath54 with @xmath55  @xcite .    in the rs scenario with the small curvature , sum ( [ kk_sum ] )",
    "was calculated analytically in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57    in order to obtain search limits for the lhc , we have calculated contributions of @xmath58-channel gravitons to @xmath0-distributions of the final leptons for different values of @xmath21 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dy_cs_14_tev ] ) .",
    "we used the mstw 2008 nnlo parton distributions  @xcite , and convolute them with the partonic cross sections ( [ quark_cross_sec ] ) , ( [ gluon_cross_sec ] ) in eq .  ( [ cross_sec ] ) .",
    "the pdf scale was taken to be equal to the invariant mass of the final leptons , @xmath59 . the following limit on pseudorapidity of the final leptons",
    "was imposed : @xmath60 , @xmath61 in ( [ cross_sec ] ) .",
    "the reconstruction efficiency of 90@xmath62 was assumed for both electrons and muons  @xcite .",
    "let us stress that in our scheme the `` new physics '' contribution _ do not depend _ on @xmath1 , provided @xmath63 , in contrast to the rs model with the large curvature @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "note that an ignorance of the graviton widths would be a _",
    "rough approximation_. in such a case , we get from ( [ kk_sum ] ) : @xmath64 fig .",
    "[ fig : dy_cs_14_zero_tev ] shows the graviton contribution to the @xmath0-distribution calculated with the use of eqs .",
    "( [ kk_sum_zero_widths ] ) . as one can see , neglecting graviton widths results in very large suppression of the cross sections .",
    "to evaluate the event rates , we used a k - factor 1.5 for the sm background , while a conservative value of k=1 was taken for the signal . only _",
    "one _ type of leptons ( electron or muon ) was taken into account .",
    "let @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) be a number of signal ( background ) events with @xmath67 gev .",
    "then we define the statistical significance @xmath68 , and require a @xmath69 effect .",
    "a statistical significance is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : dy_s_14_tev_hl ] as a function of the 5-dimensional planck scale @xmath2 for two values of an integrated luminosity .",
    "remember that @xmath2 and @xmath21 are related by eq .",
    "( [ reduced_scale ] ) .",
    "we have considered the dilepton production in the scenario with one warped extra dimension and small curvature @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "in such a scheme , the reduced 5-dimensional planck scale @xmath21 can vary from one to tens tev , while @xmath70 .",
