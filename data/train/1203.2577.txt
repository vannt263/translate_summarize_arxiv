    "the concept of particle flow calorimetry  @xcite is widely seen as one of the most promising approaches for reconstructing the energy of hadronic jets in @xmath7 colliders .",
    "much progress has been made on the particle - flow algorithms , particularly as described in  @xcite . the envisaged high granularity detectors open up new avenues to explore and further improve the event reconstruction in the detector designs envisaged for future accelerator facilities such as the ilc and clic @xmath7 linear colliders .",
    "the ability to reconstruct accurately individual photons in the midst of hadronic jets leads to the possibility to reconstruct individual di - photon resonances such as @xmath2 s .",
    "a typical multi - hadronic event consists on average of about @xmath8 of the energy in charged hadrons , @xmath9 in photons , and @xmath10 in neutral hadrons with large event - to - event fluctuations .",
    "the photons are primarily from @xmath11 and we aim to reconstruct these intermediate @xmath1 s",
    ". the results from mass - constrained fits can significantly improve the prompt electromagnetic component of jet energy resolution .",
    "the focus of this paper is to investigate the performance improvements that may be obtained for the reconstruction of the energy of multiple @xmath2 s in multi - hadronic decays of the @xmath12 using mass - constrained fits based on a realistic full simulation and event reconstruction of the ild detector .",
    "we first briefly discuss mass - constrained fits in section  [ sec : fits ] and then review some of the results obtained with toy monte carlo studies for both single @xmath2 s and multiple @xmath2 s from @xmath12 decays in section  [ sec - toymc ] .",
    "we then concentrate in section  [ sec - fullsim ] on the results obtained from full simulation of the ild detector for events with multiple @xmath2 s from @xmath12 decay at rest .",
    "a central issue is how to best pair up sibling photon candidates to parent @xmath2 s .",
    "we use three pairing algorithms :    1 .",
    "cheated ( using mc truth information ) 2 .   a realistic matching algorithm with no recourse to truth information using blossom v 3 .",
    "same as 2 , except that incorrect pairings in the solution are identified ( using mc truth information ) and replaced with the original photon measurements    we examine the mass - constrained fitting performance for the three different pairing algorithms and compare the results with the standard calorimetric measurement with no mass - constrained fits . in order to make the study tractable with the current reconstruction software",
    "we have restricted to simulating only the prompt @xmath2 component of @xmath12 decays ( ignoring potential complications from additional photon candidates originating from charged and neutral hadrons ) and requiring that none of the photons convert in the tracking volume .",
    "given a @xmath0 decay , we apply a mass - constrained fit where the invariant mass of the two photons is constrained to the @xmath2 mass .",
    "the adjusted photon momenta result in an improved energy and direction resolution for the @xmath2 . in the fit",
    "we define the photon 3-vectors using the measured energy , @xmath13 , and spherical polar coordinates , @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the photon directions as estimated from the reconstructed cluster positions in the calorimeter and the assumption of the photons originating from the interaction point .",
    "the errors on the measurements are defined assuming that the errors on @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are independent as is the case when the two photons are spatially resolved .",
    "the mass constraint relates the energies of the two photons , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , to the opening angle @xmath18 between the two photons : @xmath19 the fitting has been implemented with the marlinkinfit package  @xcite .",
    "in addition to improving the @xmath2 energy resolution when the correct photons are paired the procedure leads to a well - defined error estimate for the fitted @xmath2 energy which can potentially be used to better assign errors on the overall event reconstruction at the individual event level .",
    "however the latter has not been the focus of this paper .",
    "single @xmath2 studies have demonstrated strong potential improvements in @xmath2 energy resolution  @xcite when the photon directions ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) can be inferred with high precision . to illustrate this we show below the dependence of the @xmath2 energy resolution on the relevant factors : photon angular resolution , @xmath2 energy and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the center - of - momentum ( cm ) decay angle .",
    "these particular estimates were obtained using a toy monte carlo which assumed energy independent angular resolutions with the @xmath15 uncertainty related to the @xmath14 uncertainty by @xmath22 .",
    "table  [ tab:1pi0 ] shows as expected that the improvement in the stochastic parameter of the energy resolution , @xmath23 where @xmath24 , depends a great deal on the cm decay angle . the most dramatic improvement being for symmetric decay ( @xmath25 ) with almost no improvement at all for highly asymmetric decay . for each bin in @xmath20",
    "the distributions are rather gaussian . for a reference case of a 4 gev @xmath2 with a photon fractional energy resolution , @xmath26 of @xmath27 with @xmath13 in gev and a @xmath14 resolution of 1 mrad , the @xmath2 energy resolution ) ] improves to @xmath28 averaged over all cm decay angles while for symmetric decay the resolution improves to @xmath29 .",
    "the precise measurement of the opening angle between the two photons , @xmath18 , is the reason for the improvement in energy resolution , and this can be influenced by improving the relative error on @xmath18 - either by increasing the angle by decreasing the @xmath2 energy for the same @xmath20 or further improving the measurement precision of the photon directions .",
    "the behavior , averaged over cm decay angles , on @xmath2 energy and angular resolution are also shown in the table .",
    ".measured values of the stochastic energy resolution parameter , @xmath23 , estimated from the rms of the distribution of the stochastically scaled energy residual , @xmath30 , where @xmath13 is the fitted @xmath2 energy estimate and @xmath31 is the generator energy .",
    "the table shows the dependence on the angular resolution , @xmath2 energy , and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "unless otherwise specified the table assumes a @xmath2 energy of 4 gev , @xmath32  mrad , and an intrinsic electromagnetic calorimeter resolution , @xmath33 set to 16% . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the @xmath1 reconstruction process occasionally pairs photons incorrectly and thus generates @xmath1 s which have been fitted with an inappropriate mass constraint . in the above example , while 51% of @xmath1 s were reconstructed , an additional 19% were incorrectly identified .",
    "the effects of these errors can be seen by removing incorrect @xmath1 s and replacing with the original photons that were measured with the calorimeter and then comparing the final results . in the case of 91.2 gev @xmath3",
    "s these `` corrected '' events improve the effective energy resolution to @xmath34 with a negligible bias ( using @xmath35 ) .",
    "when using the @xmath36 estimator , and correcting for incorrect pairings , the resolution decreases to @xmath37 and the bias is also negligible .",
    "overall this indicates that incorrect pairings do negatively influence the resolution performance in a significant manner and that there is some scope for further improvement if one can reduce the error rate .",
    "the bias from incorrect pairings is small and can likely be calibrated out .",
    "a summary of the results comparing the resolution and bias estimates from the different estimators and pairing algorithms are given in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "individual distributions for the different pairing algorithms are shown in figures 1 - 4 for the generator energy sum estimates which are corrected for undetected photons .",
    "it is clear from all the distributions that the @xmath23 parameter determined from the gaussian fits does not fully account for the observed peakedness of the distributions based on mass - constrained fits .",
    "such behavior results from @xmath2 s with small @xmath38 being measured with much better energy resolution after the fit than the average fitted @xmath2 .     for different pairing algorithms using @xmath35 as the reference energy .",

    "@xmath39 is the minimum fit probability necessary to be considered part of a final match solution .",
    "the single photon chi - squared , @xmath40 represents the edge weight between photons cloned during the graph modification phase that guarantees that a perfect matching exists .",
    "it essentially allows for photons to go unmatched in the final solution .",
    "@xmath41 is the minimum photon energy that is required for a photon to be considered available to be matched .",
    "in the case of 91.2 gev @xmath3 s we found optimal values to be : @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( equivalent to 1% fit probability ) , and @xmath44 mev .",
    "any significant deviations from these values resulted in a worsening of performance .",
    "it is likely that one or more of these depends on characteristics of the events ( e.g. number and energy of particles ) and is an issue we are currently working on .",
    "efficient reconstruction of fitted @xmath1 s depends significantly on how well individual photons are reconstructed .",
    "there are a number of areas where the photon reconstruction efficiency could be improved either by algorithmic improvements or potentially by improving the detector design .",
    "* at high energies , photon energy deposits tend to be split into several sub - clusters * at energies below about 180 mev the efficiency to reconstruct photons degrades reaching 50% at 100 mev , and lower still for lower energies * photons which convert in the tracker are currently not reconstructed well and should be amenable to reconstruction with high efficiency and excellent resolution    the loss of low energy photons is of particular concern because it leads to cases where an energetic photon from a @xmath2 may more easily be paired with the wrong photon .",
    "cases where one of the photons from a @xmath2 converts in the tracker and dalitz decays should lead to a significant improvement in the overall energy resolution on the @xmath2 through mass - constrained fitting .",
    "other directions for improvement include improving upon the photon position reconstruction , the use of the information from the fitted uncertainties in assigning jet - specific energy resolution uncertainties , and the assessment of performance for events with higher energy and particle multiplicity .",
    "we have shown that with a full simulation of the ild detector response to multiple @xmath2 s that it is feasible to improve substantially the prompt electromagnetic component of jet energy resolution using mass - constrained fits . for events where both photons of the @xmath2 are detected ,",
