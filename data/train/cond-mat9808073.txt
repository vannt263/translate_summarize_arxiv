    "femtosecond pulse excitation in semiconductors induces transient carrier populations , which can be studied through ultrashort - pulse nonlinear optics to elucidate many - body effects , such as time - dependent coulomb correlations .",
    "numerous experimental and theoretical studies have been devoted to this problem in the magnetic - field - free case in the last ten years.@xcite studies of femtosecond laser spectroscopy in the presence of a strong magnetic field are relatively rare and are mainly focused on magneto - excitons at low excitation densities @xcite . for a strong resonant laser pulse which excites an electron - hole ( e - h ) system with a density above the mott ionization density , the kinetics is dominated by coulomb scattering in the correlated e - h plasma or in the correlated magneto - plasma if a strong magnetic field is present .",
    "the femtosecond quantum kinetics and the expected fwm signal of the non - equilibrium e - h plasma have been treated recently by vu _",
    "_ @xcite using bare coulomb potential for times shorter than the build - up time of screening .",
    "while the density - dependence of the optical spectra of a quasi - equilibrium 2d magneto - plasma have been calculated,@xcite the kinetics of a magneto - plasma has been studied neither experimentally nor theoretically . moreover ,",
    "the existing theory for the kinetics with a magnetic field is also not yet developed as far as in the field - free case . however , as experimental studies of the relaxation and dephasing kinetics in qw s and superlattices are in progress@xcite , we will provide a first calculation of the femtosecond fwm signal of a resonantly excited magneto - plasma in a single quantum well .",
    "we concentrate on the study of carrier - carrier scattering , while phonon and disorder scattering is not considered .",
    "a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the qw plane forces the carriers on cyclotron orbits , thus causing an additional quantum confinement . in a magnetic field of the order of more than 10 t",
    "only a few landau levels both in the conduction and valence band have to be considered .",
    "the high degeneracy of these landau levels is partially lifted by spatial inhomogeneities and by size effects .",
    "the numerical treatment of the broadening due to disorder , e.g. interface fluctuations , would require a stochastic averaging over many fwm signal calculations which is beyond present day numerical possibilities for the complex carrier kinetics treated here .",
    "therefore , we lift the degeneracy partially by a weak parabolic confinement potential .",
    "the landau levels are broadened by this confinement into landau subbands with a band width of about 2 mev .",
    "this weak parabolic confinement allows to treat the single - particle schrdinger equation still exactly in the presence of the magnetic field.@xcite these eigenfunctions of the 2d electron provide a convenient expansion basis for the non - equilibrium many - body problem . a strong quantum confinement  here caused by the qw and the strong magnetic field",
    " is generally believed to slow down the relaxation kinetics because of the reduction of the phase space for scattering processes.@xcite indeed , for low - density magneto - excitons an increase in dephasing time has been observed.@xcite however , this rule does not apply to coulomb scattering , as has been shown recently for the example of exciton - exciton scattering in qw wires.@xcite for decreasing wire width a reduction of the dephasing time has been found and explained in terms of the increase of the coulombic interaction matrix elements which overcompensated the reduction of phase space for the scattering processes .",
    "therefore it is not obvious , how the coulomb intra- and inter - landau - subband scattering will influence the resulting dephasing time in a dense magneto - plasma in detail .",
    "we present a kinetic study for a femtosecond laser - pulse excited 2d dense non - equilibrium magneto - plasma in a qw in the framework of the semiconductor bloch equations combined with coulomb scattering rates ( sec .",
    "ii ) . we expand the density matrix of a two - band semiconductor in the eigenfunctions of the 2d electron in the presence of the strong magnetic field and the weak parabolic confinement .",
    "we formulate the scattering terms for the population distribution functions of the various landau subbands and for the optically induced polarization components between the landau - subbands in the conduction and valence band in the form of non - markovian quantum kinetic scattering integrals@xcite and in the form of semiclassical boltzmann - type scattering rates .",
    "pronounced quantum kinetic effects are expected for time scales shorter than typical inverse frequencies . for the considered high magnetic fields , the cyclotron frequencies are so large that quantum kinetic effects should be of minor importance .",
    "furthermore , we prefer the use of the simpler semiclassical kinetics , because there exist still some conceptual difficulties for the quantum kinetic description , connected with the spectral electron green functions in a strong magnetic field , as will be discussed below .",
    "we calculate the time - resolved ( tr ) and time - integrated ( ti ) four - wave mixing ( fwm ) signals for two 50 fs pulses by taking into account up to three landau subbands in both the valance band and the conduction band .",
    "the carrier frequency of the two delayed pulses is tuned slightly above the un - renormalized energy gap .",
    "we simplify the problem by assuming equal effective electron and hole masses , as it can be approximately realized in strained qw s .",
    "naturally , unequally effective masses will lead to more complicated quantum beat structures in the fwm signals and modify to some extend also the resulting relaxation and dephasing rates .",
    "thus our present study should be seen only as a first idealized model calculation .",
    "the detailed numerical results based on the semiconductor bloch equations with boltzmann - type scattering kinetics are presented in sec .",
    "iii for intermediate and high plasma densities .",
    "the fwm signal is calculated by an adiabatic projection technique which is appropriate for thin samples where propagation effects are not important . for many conditions pronounced quantum beat structures with two times the cyclotron frequency",
    "are obtained both in the tr and ti fwm signals .",
    "furthermore , often relaxation oscillations are seen between the populations of two subbands , before they relax to their stationary values .",
    "the dephasing times obtained from the ti fwm signal are surprisingly short and strongly modulated as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "the unexpectedly short resulting dephasing times between 100 and 200 fs depend not only on the field values , but also on the detuning , the pulse width and the excited carrier densities . in spite of the remaining conceptual difficulties we present also first quantum kinetic calculations and compare the fwm signals with those obtained with boltzmann - type kinetics in sec .",

    "v. in an appendix we give a list of the analytically calculated coulomb matrix elements for the first three subbands .",
    "we start our investigation of a quantum well in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane which is further restricted by an additional weak lateral confinement in @xmath0 direction which lifts the degeneracy of the landau levels partially and provides a weak inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "the confinement is assumed to be given by a harmonic oscillator potential for the lower - lying states .",

    ", we include in our calculations three landau subbands in the valence and conduction band .",
    "it is important to include higher landau subbands for the kinetics after the excitation . in principle",
    "it is true even in situations where the pulses mainly excite e s and h s only in the pair of the lowest landau n=0 subbands : a certain number of e s excited in the n=1 landau subband can only relax to the n=0 subband , if simultaneously the same number of e s is excited from the n=1 to the n=2 subband if only three subbands are included . on the other hand ,",
    "say if one includes up to 5 landau subbands , then it is possible to only scatter one electron from the second landau subband to the fifth subband    and in the mean time to release three electrons from the second subband to the lowest subband . therefore , a too small number of landau subbands may change the coulomb kinetics .",

    "et al._.@xcite moreover , the beats become weaker when the magnetic field increases because then the second subband becomes less important . for @xmath123  t",
    "the beating has already disappeared in ti fwm which means that the polarization components @xmath124 are negligible in comparison to @xmath125 .",
    "this is consistent with fig .",
    "3(b ) , where the electron ( hole ) population in the second landau subband is extremely low and the beating structure disappears in the incoherently summed polarization .",

    "several effects compete with each other when the magnetic field increases . on one hand , the number of landau subbands which contribute to the coulomb scattering kinetics decreases . in particular the contributions to the dephasing from the intra- and inter - subband scattering of the higher landau subbands as well as the inter - subband scattering between the higher and lower subbands decrease . for large populations in one subband",
    "the pauli blocking may further reduce also the intra - band scattering rates .",
    "all these effects increase the dephasing time . on the other hand , with increasing @xmath55 field",
    "the degeneracy of landau subbands increases and the matrix elements of the coulomb scattering of eq .",

    "( [ fscatt ] ) and ( [ pscatt ] ) in the extreme limit where the confinement is lifted .",

    "such an ef-    fect is also kept after the weak broadening in @xmath23 space is included .",
    "thus both the increased degeneracy and the increased coulomb matrix elements reduce the dephasing time .",
    "particularly , for @xmath130 t the above discussed increase in the scattering rates is overcompensated by the loss of the contributions of the inter - subband scattering processes and the reduction of the intra subband scattering due to pauli blocking , so that a net slow increase of the dephasing time with increasing b field is obtained . for 10 t @xmath131 16 t",
    "the increasing degeneracy and the increasing coulomb matrix elements dominate over the reduction of inter - subband scattering so that the dephasing time decreases with increasing b field .      in order to obtain a dense magneto - plasma with strong carrier interaction ,",

    "this number approaches 1 when @xmath55 is around 18  t. one sees a pronounced rabi - flopping in the two lowest landau subbands . we further plot the carrier density against time @xmath77 for two different magnetic fields @xmath98  t ( fig .",

    "similar to the intermediate - density case , we find quantum beating for fields as high as 20  t with a frequency of exactly @xmath118 , although for large fields the beating become weaker .",
    "the ti fwm signals are plotted in the same figures as functions of delay time @xmath83 ( upper time scale ) .",
    "again one observes quantum beats in the ti fwm signals .",
    "interestingly , the beating frequency is close to that in the incoherently summed polarization and is a little bit smaller than @xmath118 for higher fields . for example , when @xmath121  t , @xmath135  fs whereas from the beating in ti fwm , one finds a period around 76  fs .",
    "this difference may be understood in terms of many - body effects , such as band gap renormalization , pauli blocking and excitonic enhancement .",
    "we conclude that the quantum beats in the high - density case are also caused by interferences between the optically induced polarizations @xmath136 and @xmath137 of the two lowest subbands .",
    "the effective dephasing is plotted as a function of the magnetic field @xmath55 in fig .",
    "once more we find a gradual overall decrease of the dephasing time with increasing field in the regime from 10 to 20  t. this is in agreement with our earlier results in the intermediate - density case for 10  t@xmath126  t. the dephasing is mainly controlled in the whole range by the kinetics in the lowest two landau subbands . compared to the intermediate - density regime , one observes a sharp dip around 15  t in the dephasing time . by investigating the distribution function",
    ", we find the dip around 15 t is mainly due to the function of the second pulse .",
    "when @xmath55 is smaller than 15  t , the second pulse further pumps electrons from valence band to conduction band . due to the density dependent red shift of the subbands and the pauli blocking for the optical transition in the lowest subband , the second",
    "pulse increases the population of the second subband relative to that of the first one .",
    "the ratio of the densities in the lowest two subbands @xmath138 falls from around 5.7 after the first pulse to 4 after the second pulse when @xmath55=14  t , and that number goes from 8 to 3.9 for @xmath139  t. this means the role of second subband becomes more important to the dephasing .",
    "this gives rise to the sharp decrease of the dephasing time .",
    "however for @xmath140  t , the lowest landau subband is already highly populated and due to the high magnetic field value , the second landau subband is already relatively far away from the center of the pulse , so that the second pulse depopulates the electrons from the first conduction subband .",
    "although this makes again the density of lowest subband closer to the second one , the ratio @xmath138 after the second pulse goes from 3.9 at 15  t to 6 at 16  t. this clearly indicates the loss of the second subband to the dephasing processes and explains the fast increase of the dephasing time from 15 to 16  t. after 16  t , although the first pulse populates more carriers to the lowest subband with increasing magnetic field due to the density - dependent band gap shift , the rate of change becomes smaller as the lowest subband is nearly filled .",
    "however , the depopulation due to the second pulse becomes stronger with increasing magnetic fields .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that @xmath138 after the second pulse goes down from 6 for @xmath139  t to finally 5 for @xmath122  t. our results show that the decrease of pauli blocking together with the increasing of intra - subband scattering matrix element in the lowest subband dominate in the high magnetic field range the dephasing and explain the resulting decrease of dephasing time .",
    "because of the assumed pulse duration of 50  fs is already shorter than period of our quantum beats @xmath141  fs at @xmath142  t , one may expect that the memory effects of the quantum kinetic scattering integrals already may play a role .",
    "therefore we performed also quantum kinetic calculation based on eqs .",
    "( [ fscatt ] ) and ( [ pscatt ] ) . in this case",
    ", there is an undetermined damping @xmath65 in the memory kernel . in principle",
    "this term should be function of @xmath23 , @xmath143 , the magnetic field and the electron distributions , and should be determined self - consistently.@xcite however , the inclusion of such effects will complicate the quantum kinetics considerably .",
    "therefore , we took @xmath65 as an adjustable constant .",
    "such a simple approximation causes the violation of energy conservation in longtime limit and we find that the results , particularly for the ti fwm signals and therefore the dephasing are highly sensitive to the actual value of the damping constant .    in fig .",
    "10 we plot the tr fwm signal for pulses with @xmath132 and @xmath144  fs for @xmath121  t. the solid curve is based on quantum kinetics with @xmath145  mev .",
    "the dashed curve is the prediction based on boltzmann kinetics as shown in fig .",
    "8(b ) . from fig .",
    "10 one can see that the two theories give qualitatively similar tr fwm signals , although the coherence of the polarization components is clearly larger according to quantum kinetics in the first few hundred femtoseconds because of the retarded onset of the dephasing processes in this theory .    however , we point out that the consistence in fig .  10 depends on the choice of @xmath65 and we failed to get consistent results for all the fields and delays with",
    "_ one _ constant damping @xmath65 .",
    "a more detailed treatment of the damping of the memory kernel is needed for a consistent quantum kinetic theory .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed theoretical studies of femtosecond kinetics of an optically excited 2d magneto - plasmas for intermediate- and high - density excitations . based on a three - subband model in both the conduction and the valence band , our study is restricted to high magnetic fields .",
    "we calculated the intra- and inter - landau - subband kinetics by bare coulomb potential scattering and found pronounced relaxation oscillations to occur in the population of the two lowest landau subbands for lower magnetic fields .",
    "we calculated both tr and ti fwm signals .",
    "both signals exhibit quantum beats with frequencies around @xmath118 . surprisingly , the resulting dephasing times are rather short and are modulated in the strong magnetic field by about 30% .",
    "depending on the detuning of the laser pulses , the pulse width , the excited densities and the number of excited landau subbands one gets decrease of the dephasing time with increasing @xmath55 field because of the increase of the coulomb matrix elements and the degeneracy of the landau subbands . in regions where the loss of scattering channels exceeds these increasing effects",
    ", one can also obtain a slight increase of the dephasing time with the magnetic field .",
    "it is shown that the retarded onset of the dephasing and relaxation processes in quantum kinetics result in a fwm signal which is more coherent in the first few hundred femtoseconds .",
    "however a consistent theory of the decay of the memory kernel in a magneto - plasma is still missing . finally , we point out that more landau subbands are needed to account for the kinetics in lower magnetic fields .",
    "a corresponding extension of the theory is still under investigation and the results will be published elsewhere .",
    "we acknowledge financial support by the dfg within the dfg - schwerpunkt `` quantenkohrenz in halbleiter '' .",
    "mww would like to thank prof .",
    "l. bnyai for valuable discussions during the initial stage of this work which helped him to get into this filed smoothly .",
    "we give the analytic expressions for all the coulomb interaction matrix elements eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) up to the third landau subbands .",
    "we first show the approximation we take in our calculation through @xmath146 . after integrating out @xmath0 and @xmath147 , @xmath146 of eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) can be written into @xmath148 due to the factor @xmath149 @xmath146 decays quickly with increasing @xmath150 .",
    "therefore the main contribution to the matrix element comes from small values of @xmath150 .",
    "we therefore neglect the term @xmath151 inside the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ v0000 ] ) .",
    "the integral remaining can be carried out analytically .",
    "similar approximation may be applied to other matrix elements and therefore , eq .  ( [ v ] ) may be written as @xmath152 defining two dimensionless variables @xmath153 and @xmath154 as ref .",
    ", one can express the matrix elements in terms of zeroth- ( @xmath155 ) and first - order ( @xmath156 ) modified bessel functions .",
    "as there exist the following symmetry relations for the matrix elements @xmath157 one only needs to calculate 27 terms .",
    "the remaining terms may be got from the symmetry relations . in the following we give these required 27 terms : @xmath158 with @xmath159 . @xmath160",
    "it is noted here and hereafter the term @xmath161 strictly should be @xmath162 with sgn standing for the sign function .",
