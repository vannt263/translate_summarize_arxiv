    "spin polarized isospin asymmetric nuclear matter is an infinite nuclear system composed of four different fermionic components : neutrons with spin up and spin down having densities @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively , and protons with spin up and spin down with densities @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",

    "the splitting , @xmath109@xmath110 , in the neutron and proton single - particle potentials can be mainly ascribed to two reasons : ( i ) the change in the number of pairs which the nucleon under consideration @xmath111 can form with the remaining nucleons @xmath112 of the system as nuclear matter is spin polarized , and ( ii ) the spin dependence ( and isospin dependence for asymmetric spin polarized matter ) of the nucleon - nucleon @xmath49 matrices in the spin polarized nuclear medium ( see eq .

    "note also , in the totally polarized symmetric case , that when the orientation of neutron and proton spins is antiparallel this contribution , although it is present , is much less attractive or even repulsive ( see table [ tab : tab2 ] ) than the corresponding one of nonpolarized symmetric matter .",
    "in addition , in all cases the contribution from spin triplet channels in totally polarized matter is always less attractive ( or even repulsive at high density ) than the corresponding one to nonpolarized matter . in particular , it is mainly this contribution the one which explains the difference between the energies of totally polarized symmetric matter with a parallel and an antiparallel orientation of neutron and proton spins , being in the antiparallel case less attractive or more repulsive .",
    "an interesting conclusion which can be inferred from our microscopic calculations is that a spontaneous transition to a spin polarized state , i.e. , to a so - called ferromagnetic state , of nuclear matter is not to be expected for all the possible isospin asymmetries ranging from symmetric to pure neutron matter .",

    "employing a realistic modern nucleon - nucleon interaction ( nsc97e ) we have studied properties of spin polarized isospin asymmetric nuclear matter within the brueckner  hartree  fock approximation .",
    "we have determined the single particle potentials of neutrons and protons with spin up and down for several values of the neutron and proton spin polarizations and the asymmetry parameter .",
    "we have found that the potentials exhibit an almost linear and symmetric variation as a function of these parameters .",
    "deviations from this behaviour occur at higher values of the asymmetry parameter and spin polarizations .",
    "these deviations have to be attributed to the dependence of the nucleon - nucleon @xmath49 matrices on @xmath124 and @xmath33 .",
    "we have calculated the total energy per particle as a function of the density for totally polarized and nonpolarized neutron , asymmetric and symmetric matter .",
    "we have found that in the range of densities explored ( up to @xmath194 ) totally polarized matter is always more repulsive than nonpolarized matter for any asymmetry .",
    "this is due to a combination effect of the kinetic and potential energy contributions .",
    "we have also found in the totally polarized case that asymmetric and symmetric matter is more repulsive when neutron and proton spins are antiparallelly orientated than when all the spins are aligned along the same direction .",
    "we have constructed an analytic parametrization of the total energy per particle as a function of the asymmetry parameter and spin polarizations .",
    "the quality of this parametrization has been tested , finding deviations from the microscopic calculation of at most @xmath184 .",
    "nevertheless , deviations are higher for higher values of the asymmetry parameter and spin polarization , and the coefficients of the parametrization need to be refitted when large values of the spin and isospin asymmetries are considered .    employing this parametrization we have determined the magnetic susceptibility of nuclear matter for several values of the asymmetry from neutron to symmetric matter in terms of the ratio det(@xmath88)/det(@xmath89 ) .",
    "we have found that this quantity increases monotonously with density , from which it can be inferred that a phase transition to a ferromagnetic state is not to be expected in nuclear matter at any density for any asymmetry .",
    "finally , our results confirm the reduction of about a factor @xmath22 of the magnetic susceptibility of neutron matter with respect to its fermi gas value found recently by fantoni _",
