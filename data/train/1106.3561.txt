    "in recent observations it is strongly believed that the universe is experiencing an accelerated expansion .",
    "the observation from type ia supernovae [ 1 ] in associated with large scale structure [ 2 ] and cosmic microwave background anisotropies [ 3 ] have shown the evidences to support cosmic acceleration .",
    "the main theory responsible for this scenario is the theory of dark energy .",
    "this mysterious dark energy with negative pressure leads to this cosmic acceleration .",

    "sami has discussed cosmological prospect of rolling tachyon with exponential potential . in [ 18 ] debnath has shown that the emergent scenario is possible for the closed universe if the universe contains the normal tachyon field and for the phantom field ( or tachyonic field ) the emergent scenario is possible for flat , open and closed universe .",
    "the holographic description of tachyon dark energy in frw model has been studied by setare [ 19 ] .",
    "+ motivated from the consistency of observational measurement of cmb about the spectral index and ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations , we have considered two pre - assigned form of scale factors ( backward approach ) as : ( i )  intermediate scenario \" and ( ii )  logamediate scenario \" [ 16 , 17 ] to study of the expanding anisotropic universe in the presence of tachyon field and phantom scalar field .",
    "this approach is new as we have studied the expansion of the universe in anisotropic model , where we consider the two scale factors independently follow the said scenarios . in the first case",
    "the scale factors evolve separately as @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "so the expansion of the universe is slower than standard de sitter inflation ( arises when @xmath10 ) but faster than power law inflation with power greater than 1 .",
