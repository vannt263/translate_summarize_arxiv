    "the description of electron - ion collisions in the presence of a strong oscillatory electric field has been an essential part of every laser plasma interaction model .",
    "processes such as collisional laser energy absorption , bremsstrahlung radiation emission and transport include electron scattering on ions in the presence of a high frequency electromagnetic field .",
    "advances in laser technology , particularly those related to the generation of ultra - short laser pulses and progress in inertial confinement fusion studies have challenged our understanding of scattering processes over a wide range of conditions and plasma parameters .",
    "nonetheless , heating rate calculations @xcite in strong laser fields have involved simplifications that are equivalent to a born approximation for electron trajectories in the coulomb fields .",
    "this approximation , although well - accepted in the physics community , should be revisited in view of recently discovered nonlinear processes such as harmonic generation and above threshold ionization @xcite that have been explained as being due to strong modifications of electron orbits in the laser field during electron - ion scattering events .",
    "similar nonlinear modifications of particle trajectories have recently been discussed in numerical studies of inverse bremsstrahlung heating rates @xcite .",
    "our paper continues this analysis ; we examine classical electron trajectories that contribute to enhanced plasma heating @xcite and discuss their importance for calculations of effective collision frequencies with certain classes of electron distribution functions .",
    "we also summarize existing theories of inverse bremsstrahlung heating and compare them with results of our test particle calculations .    for the purpose of making comparisons , seminal works by dawson and oberman @xcite and silin @xcite and numerous subsequent publications on high field effects @xcite are classified into several broad categories : classical - mechanical analysis of binary electron - ion collisions in the dielectric approximation @xcite ; kinetic theory which uses the landau - type collision integral in the oscillating electron field @xcite ; ballistic model ( or the model of instantaneous electron - ion collision ) @xcite ; `` first principle '' quantum - mechanical calculations @xcite ; and , more recently , the quantum kinetic theory in the dielectric approximation @xcite .",
    "all theories consider the two body scattering problem as a starting point and their predictions lead to remarkably similar expressions which may differ only by a logarithmic factor .",
    "the agreement between these approaches follows from two common characteristics inherent in all theories , i.e. the born approximation is used for the electron orbits in a coulomb field and the cross - section is assumed to have a weak dependence on the laser field phase .",
    "the first approximation , with notable exception of the low frequency approximation @xcite , has been employed in most quantum mechanical calculations @xcite where it applies to fast electrons with the velocity @xmath0 satisfying the condition @xmath1 @xcite , where @xmath2 is the ion charge .",
    "the born approximation is equivalent to small angle scattering and small momentum exchange in classical kinetic theory studies @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a straight line electron trajectory approximation , that is also a part of ideal plasma collision theories that lead to the landau or balescu - guernsey - lenard operators @xcite .",
    "a simplified description of electron orbits removes the sensitivity of scattering processes to the initial phase of an electric field .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated @xcite that groups of electrons entering an ion interaction sphere at specific phase can significantly modify the collisional cross - section and the heating rates .",
    "irregular electron trajectories in the combined , high frequency field of a laser and a coulomb field of an ion have been found by wiesenfeld @xcite .",
    "his numerical studies have identified stochastic trajectories for electrons with quiver velocity larger than the initial drift velocity .",
    "this effect has been elaborated upon in detail in recent studies by fraiman _",
    "in addition to irregular trajectories that involve quasi - capture of electrons in complicated orbits encircling ions , a phase space analysis has revealed the existence of initial conditions corresponding to large angle correlated collisions with anomalously large energy transfer from the field to particles .",
    "it was shown recently in ref .",
    "@xcite that the effect of correlated collisions exists not only in the coulomb potential but also in short - range potentials in the presence of a strong laser field",
    ".    there is a similarity between these processes and the interpretation of such atomic physics phenomena as multi - photon ionization and harmonic generation proposed by corkum @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that free electrons that are created in the process of tunnel ionization can be brought back to the original atom by the laser field and undergo multiple correlated collisions .",
    "this process is sensitive to the phase of an electron in the oscillatory field and is responsible for processes such as high - harmonic generation , two - electron ejection , double ionization , etc . from the point of view of quantum mechanics ,",
    "the high probability of secondary scattering was explained by the phenomenon of coulomb focusing @xcite .",
    "this is a process by which the coulomb attraction of the ion compensates for the natural dispersion of the electron wave packet .",
    "a classical analog involves the slowly moving electron that is brought repeatedly into close proximity of an ion as it performs large amplitude oscillations in the laser field .",
    "each encounter results in a small deflection of an electron trajectory toward the ion .",
    "these small changes accumulate into a deflection of an electron trajectory leading to a head - on collision producing large momentum change and causes an electron to leave the ion interaction sphere .",
    "an important question in the context of laser produced plasmas is determining under what circumstances such trajectories are statistically significant and can alter macroscopic heating rates .",
    "our paper examines effects of correlated collisions and irregular scattering trajectories on the inverse bremsstrahlung heating rate . by using mechanisms such as the coulomb focusing @xcite , the parachute effect @xcite or quasi - capture @xcite",
    ", we analyze strongly modified electron orbits and classify them in terms of their initial phase , impact parameters , and drift velocities . by means of test particle simulations",
    "we examine the statistical importance of these trajectories .",
    "they indeed strongly modify the heating rates for all three different energy distribution functions used in the simulations , i.e. mono - energetic , maxwellian and anisotropic electron distribution functions .",
    "as we show in this paper , there are large discrepancies between existing analytical theories and test particle simulations of heating rates .",
    "they warrant further investigations that may include molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "classical models of electron - ion interactions in molecular dynamics models include an effective potential @xcite to prevent the collapse of such system due to electrostatic attraction and properly account for quantum diffraction effects at short distances .",
    "we will also perform test particle simulations with this effective potential and will compare them with coulomb potential scattering studies .",

    "the contribution of electrons with parallel velocities is not evident in eq .",
    "( [ hmax ] ) because small angles , @xmath137 , make a small statistical contribution to the average quantity for the isotropic distribution function .",

    "this effect is confined to small angles and it disappears if electrons are distributed isotropically .",
    "therefore for typical laser plasma interaction conditions , the heating rate might depend dramatically on the number of slow electrons and on the anisotropy of actual electron distribution function .",
    "in particular , this effect could be important for plasmas produced by the ionization of gases by high intensity laser pulses . according to refs .",
    "@xcite , the velocity distribution function of the photoelectrons displays a strong anisotropy along the direction of the linearly polarized laser beam , if tunnel ionization is the dominant mechanism .",
    "the following simple analytical expression captures the main features of electrons produced by the tunnel ionization process @xcite : @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the electron velocity in the direction of laser polarization and the effective electron temperature @xmath41 may be a function of the ionization potential and the laser field amplitude @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we treat @xmath41 as a free parameter .",
    "we compare results of various analytical models with our simulations after averaging them with respect to the distribution function ( [ adist ] ) .",
    "this averaging reduces to a simple integration of expressions for the electron energy gain in the parallel geometry ( [ bornpar ] ) and ( [ kwpar ] ) with a one - dimensional maxwellian velocity distribution .",

    "figure [ fig8 ] shows the intensity dependence of the heating rates that are obtained from our numerical model and from various analytical expressions . the striking discrepancy between the analytical results and our numerical simulations is a consequence of the large number of slow electrons in the electron distribution function ( [ adist ] ) propagating parallel to the polarization direction .",
    "contrary to the case of a three dimensional maxwellian distribution function , expression ( [ adist ] ) contains a finite number of electrons at zero velocity and therefore the heating rate diverges as a logarithm of @xmath164 , if one averages the energy gain ( [ epar ] ) with the one - dimensional electron distribution function .",
    "this divergence can be resolved by accounting for the fact that the maximum impact parameter @xmath165 can not be greater than the inter - particle distance @xmath157 .",
    "this leads to the following estimate @xmath166 .",
    "then one finds the following expression for the heating rate per electron : @xmath167 this expression is proportional to @xmath168 .",
    "it approximates well numerical results as shown with the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] .",
    "photo - ionized plasmas with anisotropic electron distributions provide an example of a case where enhanced heating rates are obtained due to correlated collisions as described in our paper .",
    "it is clear that the particular form ( [ adist ] ) of the electron distribution function can be quickly altered due to rapid heating .",
    "however , inverse bremsstrahlung heating can potentially support a certain level of anisotropy in the electron distribution function .",
    "more work needs to be done in developing the self - consistent electron distribution for this case and in comparing this model with experiments .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations based on the test particle model which involves classical electron trajectories in the electric field of an ion and a homogeneous , high frequency laser field . we have confirmed recent results by fraiman _",
    "et al_. @xcite regarding the electron orbits that closely approach an ion several times during each scattering event and subsequently lead to a large angle deflection and to a large enhancement in the electron energy .",
    "these correlated collisions have been ignored in preceding theories which significantly underestimate the electron heating rates by neglecting large angle scattering and the important field phase dependence of electron trajectories .",
    "the inverse - bremsstrahlung heating rates have been evaluated for different electron distribution functions , including : mono - energetic beam - like electrons , maxwellian and highly anisotropic distribution relevant to photo - ionized gases .",
    "the energy gain for electrons with small drift velocities and for large amplitude electric fields , @xmath21 , increases as @xmath103 and exceeds the previously known results if @xmath169 .",
    "this behavior contradicts results of all analytical theories and it is especially important for electrons with initial velocities that are parallel to the field amplitude . when the quantum short - distance cut - off is introduced through an effective potential , the energy gains demonstrate a similar dependence on the particle drift velocity but a smaller magnitude of enhancement is obtained if the cut - off length , @xmath170 , is larger than the characteristic radius of the coulomb interaction @xmath171 .    for isotropic maxwellian distribution functions , the heating rate in the limit of @xmath154 is _ independent _ on the laser intensity",
    ". it can be approximated by the interpolation expression ( [ hmax ] ) for the effective collision frequency .",
    "for highly anisotropic electron distribution functions such as those produced by photo - ionization , the new effect of large angle correlated scattering dominates the heating rate at high laser intensities .",
    "it leads to @xmath168 dependence of the heating rate .",
    "our numerical results involve calculations of the electron scattering on a single ion .",
    "they are relevant to realistic plasma conditions provided the two - body collision approximation @xmath58 ( [ vcon1 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "this imposes an upper limit on the laser intensity for a given ion density and typically holds for very underdense plasmas .",
    "also , we have implicitly assumed that the plasma is weakly coupled and that the average distance between ions , @xmath157 is smaller than the screening length , @xmath48 .",
    "the enhancement of the inverse bremsstrahlung heating rates should influence laser plasma interaction experiments .",
    "for example , the collisional heating of long preformed plasmas by high intensity short laser pulses accompanies several important applications , including x - ray lasers , laser wake - field particle accelerators , and the high - harmonics generation .",
    "moderate ion densities in the plasma waveguide ( @xmath172 @xmath51 ) should make it easier to satisfy condition ( [ vcon1 ] ) .",
    "high intensity picosecond laser pulses would allow investigation of the heating rate dependence on @xmath152 over the wide range of values .",
    "atomic processes involved in x - ray lasers are very sensitive to plasma temperature and could provide a diagnostic method for the inverse bremsstrahlung heating rates in addition to other diagnostics techniques such as the thomson scattering and absorption measurements .",
