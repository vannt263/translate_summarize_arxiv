    "several experimental studies of electronic properties of graphene bilayers were recently reported in the literature @xcite . while experiments refs .",

    "was the fact that a tunable gap emerges in the energy spectrum of bilayer upon applying an interlayer bias @xcite .",
    "various consequences of the opening of the gap were studied theoretically in refs .  .",
    "one of these consequences is that biased bilayer responds to disorder as a `` normal '' semiconductor , i.e. , impurities give rise to the tails of the density of states which extend into the gap from the bottom of conduction and from the top of the valence band .",
    "such in - gap localized states are especially relevant to the experiment ref .  , where the inelastic transport over these states has been observed .",

    "we study analytically the density of disorder - induced localized in - gap states in bilayer graphene .",
    "the reason why classical results @xcite for the fluctuation tails do not directly apply to this situation , is a peculiar structure of the bare energy spectrum shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in particular , the minimum ( maximum ) of the electron ( hole ) dispersion is located at finite momentum@xcite , @xmath8 .",
    "also , at energies of the order of the gap , the dispersion law is not quadratic , but rather @xmath9 .",
    "these two features naturally define two regimes of disorder - induced broadening of the density of states :    ( _ i _ ) weak disorder . the magnitude of smearing in this regime is smaller than the depth of the minimum in fig .  1 . as a result ,",
    "the states responsible for the smearing have momenta close to @xmath8 .",
