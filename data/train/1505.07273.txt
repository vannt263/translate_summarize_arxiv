    "in classical mechanics , the determination of the motion of two celestial bodies , which interact only with each other , is the typical two - body problem .",
    "if one body is light enough , the uncontrolled motion of the light body around a heavy body is a restricted two - body problem , and the motion is well - known as keplerian motion .",
    "a common example is the artificial bodies , i.e. , spacecrafts or satellites , moving around the earth .",
    "once the atmospheric effects are negligible and the earth overwhelmingly dominates the gravitational influence , a satellite moves stably on a periodic orbit if the mechanical energy of the satellite is negative . as an increasing number of artificial satellites have been launched into space around the earth or even into deeper space since the mid of last century , an important problem arises in astronautics , that is to control the keplerian motion of a satellite to transfer between different orbits to achieve desired mission requirements .    the control of an artificial satellite is generally performed by system propulsion , expelling mass in a high speed to generate an opposite reaction force according to newton s third law of motion .",
    "up to now , there are already several types of propulsion systems available , including chemical propulsion systems and electric propulsion systems . though chemical propulsion systems are able to provide much higher thrust , electric propulsion systems have the the potential for a much higher specific impulse than is available from chemical ones , resulting in a lower fuel consumption and thus a longer satellite lifetime for a given propellant mass . on the one hand ,",
    "the electric propulsion systems provide a fuel - efficient means to control the motion of a satellite ; on the other hand , the fact that the possible maximum thrust , which the electric propulsion systems can provide , is very low results that the transfer time is exponentially long .",
    "hence , the optimization of transfer time has be studied in refs .",
    "in addition , the strong - local optimality of such problems was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    though the low - thrust control systems provide an fuel - efficient means to control the motion of a satellite , the problem that whether or not it has the ability to move a satellite from one point to another one arises",
    "this is actually a controllability property , which is a prerequisite to analyze mission feasibility during designing a space mission or designing an optimal trajectory . restricting the mechanical energy of a satellite into negative region without any other state constraints ,",
    "the controlled motion is called orbital transfer problem ( otp ) , and the controllability for otp was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite to show that there exists admissible controlled trajectories for every otp if the maximum thrust is positive . in the current paper , the controllability for otp is established using alternative techniques from geometric control , ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . taking into account the state constraint that the radius of a satellite is larger than the radius of the surface of the atmosphere around the earth ,",
    "the orbital insertion problem ( oip ) and de - orbit problem ( dop ) are defined in this paper .",
    "some controllability properties for oip and dop are then addressed and we show that there exist admissible controlled trajectories for oips and dops if and only if the maximum thrust is bigger than a specific value ( depending on the initial point or final point ) .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following . in section",
    "[ se : notation ] , we recall the basic properties of the dynamics of the motion of a satellite around the earth , and basic notations and definitions are given which are crucial for analysis of controllability properties . in section [",
    "se : controllability ] , the controllability for otps is represented firstly by using geometric control technology in ref .",
    "then , the controllability properties for oips and dops are derived in subsections [ se : p-_p+ ] and [ se : p+_p- ] , respectively . in section [",
