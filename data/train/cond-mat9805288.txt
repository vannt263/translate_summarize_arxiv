    "systems with many degrees of freedom which are pinned in some external potential are very common in condensed matter .",
    "examples are fluid - fluid interfaces in porous media @xcite , flux - lattices in type - ii superconductors @xcite , and charge density waves @xcite to mention only a few . also dry friction ( i.e. , solid - solid friction ) belongs to this class of systems because the asperities of the surfaces interlock .    a common feature of all these systems is a strongly nonlinear mobility .",
    "if one applies some field or force @xmath0 on the system , the mobility is zero below some usually well - defined threshold @xmath1 . above this threshold",
    "the mobility is nonzero . in general",
    "it is some nonlinear function of the applied force @xmath0 .",
    "the transition from a pinned system with zero mobility to a depinned one with some finite , nonzero mobility is called the _ pinning - depinning transition_. it can be understood as a kind of `` melting '' which happens far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "the process is a typical nonequilibrium one because of two reasons .",
    "first , there is no ground state for @xmath2 and the pinned system has to be in some metastable state . due to thermal fluctuations",
    "the system can overcome the barrier of the metastable state and move into another metastable state with less energy .",
    "this phenomenon leads to _ creeping _ with a very low mobility .",
    "second , beyond the pinning - depinning transition energy flows through the system at a constant rate which is given by the mobility times @xmath3 .",
    "this flow is usually not small .",
    "thus it can not be deduced from linear response theory which works only near thermal equilibrium .",
    "the mobility of the sliding state strongly depends on the kind of energy dissipation .",
    "the inverse process of this nonequilibrium melting is the _ depinning - pinning transition _ which is a kind of nonequilibrium `` freezing '' .",
    "both kind of transitions do not have to occur at the same value of the applied force @xmath0 .",
    "the behavior depends strongly on whether the degrees of freedom ( i.e. , flux lines , atoms etc . ) have inertia or inertia is negligible compared to dissipative forces . in the case of strong dissipation",
    "the motion is overdamped .",
    "the pinning - depinning transition is in most cases of second order and indistinguishable from the depinning - pinning transition .",
    "typical examples for such systems are flux lines in type - ii superconductors and charge - density waves . if the motion is underdamped , hysteresis is possible because the inertia can overcome a pinning center .",
    "this is intuitively clear if one imagines the simplest model system of this kind , namely a particle in a spatially periodic potential @xcite .",
    "another important aspect of the collective behavior of pinned systems is whether the potential caused by the pinning centers is regular or irregular ( quenched randomness ) .",
    "often the pinning landscape is random .",
    "this case together with a purely dissipative diffusion - like dynamics has been studied extensively in the literature @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the opposite case in a fairly simple model , namely , the frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model @xcite .",
    "there is no quenched randomness .",
    "all pinning centers are identical forming a regular array .",
    "furthermore , all pinned objects are identical and have a mass .",
    "the damping is assumed to be weak .",
    "we will see that weak damping is responsible for randomness that is caused by chaotic motion .",
    "important physical applications of the fk model are arrays of identical josephson junctions @xcite and adsorbate layers on clean crystal surfaces @xcite .    in this paper we consider the one - dimensional fk model .",
    "the equation of motion ( in dimensionless units ) reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the position of particle @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the damping constant , @xmath8 is the strength of the external potential , and @xmath0 is the external force .",
    "the time derivative is denoted by a dot . in order to avoid effects due to the boundary layers we choose periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of particles and @xmath11 is an arbitrary integer .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions fixes the average particle distance @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "because of symmetry @xmath12 can be restricted to interval @xmath14 $ ] without loss of generality ..    together with the previous paper @xcite in which we have already investigated periodic and quasiperiodic solutions , the aim is to give a detailed investigation of the dynamical behavior in the weakly damped case for long chains ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) .    in this paper",
    "we deal with spatio - temporal chaotic solutions ( called _ fluid - sliding states _ ) and the transition between these solutions and the stationary states .",
    "the typical behavior is summarized in figure  [ f.vf.chaos ] .",
    "[ f.vf.chaos](a ) shows the velocity - force characteristic .",
    "we see hysteresis loops between three different branches which belong to different types of solutions .",
    "the states with the largest average sliding velocities @xmath16 are the _ solid - sliding states _ which are characterized by a chain with nearly no internal vibrations .",
    "these states have the maximum possible mobility , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "the solid - sliding state becomes unstable due to first - order parametric resonance if @xmath16 is below some critical value@xcite .",
    "the second type of sliding state is the fluid - sliding state . in general",
    "one can summarize all sliding states having not the maximum mobility into this category . but strictly speaking the name makes only sense if these states are spatio - temporally chaotic . for larger values of the damping constant",
    "this is not the case as we have seen in the previous paper .",
    "the chaotic vibration in the fluid - sliding state can be characterized by an _",
    "effective temperature_. the temperature of the fluid - sliding states of fig .",
    "[ f.vf.chaos](a ) is shown in figure  [ f.vf.chaos](b ) . even though the distribution of the particle velocity @xmath18 is gaussian",
    "[ see inset of fig .",
    "[ f.vf.chaos](b ) ] we will show that the fluid - sliding state is a _",
    "nonequilibrium _ state . a very specific test to show this is the violation of the equipartition theorem for the phonon modes ( see sec .",
    "[ stc ] ) .",
    "the third type of states are the stationary ones .",
    "their mobility is zero . in order to model the creeping due to thermal activation",
    "one has to add a white - noise term to the equation of motion ( [ int : eqm ] ) .",
    "we have not done this because the qualitative behavior does not change very much as long as the thermal energy is much smaller than the amplitude of the external potential .",
    "this is confirmed in numerical simulations of similar models @xcite .",
    "for example , the hysteresis seen in fig .  [",
    "f.vf.chaos](a ) still exist for nonzero but small temperatures @xcite . for this behavior it seems to be important that the system has many degrees of freedom because in the case of @xmath19 the hysteresis disappears even for infinitesimal small noise amplitude @xcite .",
    "[ f.vf.chaos](b ) clearly shows that nonequilibrium melting and freezing is accompanied by an abrupt change of the temperature of the chain .",
    "the transition is like a first - order one in thermal equilibrium but the pinning - depinning transition point is larger than the depinning - pinning transition point .",
    "thus hysteresis occurs .",
    "the transition points fluctuate [ see inset of fig .",
    "[ f.vf.chaos](a ) ] , especially the pinning - depinning transition point .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ cs ] we investigate in detail the fluid - sliding state .",
    "we show that it is indeed spatio - temporally chaotic . for chains with @xmath20 near an integer value we found a pronounced transition from a kink - dominated sliding state and the fluid - sliding state .",
    "this transition is relatively sharp even though there is no hysteresis .",
    "but it becomes hysteretic for small @xmath10 .",
    "the depinning - pinning transition and the pinning - depinning transition are discussed in section  [ mf ] .",
    "we show that nonequilibrium freezing is similar to ordinary freezing whereas melting is clearly different .",
    "the pinning - depinning transition point depends on the stationary state .",
    "furthermore local rearrangements ( micro - slips ) of the chain may occur before the transition . in section  [ con ]",
    "we compare our results with results of similar models .",
    "decreasing the damping constant @xmath7 increases the complexity of the sliding state from periodic motion via quasi - periodic motion ( which is usually spatially chaotic , see the preceding paper ) to spatio - temporal chaos .",
    "an example of the latter one is shown in figure  [ f.chaos ] .",
    "the aim of this section is to investigate and to characterize the chaotic - sliding state which we call the _ fluid - sliding state_. first of all we see in fig .",
    "[ f.vf.chaos](a ) that the velocity - force characteristic of this state is nearly structureless .",
    "this has to be compared with the case of periodic and quasiperiodic motion where a multitude of hysteresis loops appear ( see the preceding paper ) . here",
    "there occur only hysteresis loops between the solid - sliding state ( where the particles are shaken so fast that they nearly do not feel the external potential ) , the fluid - sliding state and the stationary states .",
    "fig  [ f.chaos ] is of course not a proof that the chain slides chaotically .",
    "it is well - known that chaotic motion is characterized by the sensitivity on the initial conditions .",
    "it is measured by the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath21 , which is the rate of divergence ( or convergence , if it is negative ) of trajectories in phase space that start out infinitely close to each other @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f.lmax ] shows that the fluid - sliding states in figs .",
    "[ f.chaos ] and [ f.vf.chaos ] are indeed temporally chaotic .    but",
    "is it also spatially chaotic ? in order to answer this question we have calculated the normalized velocity correlation function @xmath22 defined by @xmath23 where @xmath24 for the same parameters as in fig .",
    "[ f.chaos ] the result is shown in figure  [ f.cf ] .",
    "one clearly sees that @xmath22 is a rapidly decaying oscillatory function .",
    "the envelope seems to be proportional to @xmath25 with a correlation length @xmath26 . because of @xmath27 and @xmath28 the fluid - sliding state is spatio - temporally chaotic .",
    "a very strong criterion for spatio - temporal chaos is that the number of positive lyapunov exponents is proportional to @xmath10 for large @xmath10 .",
    "we have calculated the lyapunov spectrum with the method described in ref .   for various values of @xmath10 .",
    "figure  [ f.lspect ] shows the cumulative density @xmath29 of lyapunov exponents , i.e. , the probability to find a lyapunov exponent larger than @xmath30 .",
    "the result is typical for spatio - temporal chaos @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "( i.e. , @xmath31 ) the sequence of cumulative densities @xmath32 converges uniformly to @xmath33 .",
    "thus , for large @xmath10 the number of positive lyapunov exponents is indeed proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "[ f.lspect ] shows clearly that the spatio - temporally chaotic nature of the fluid - sliding state does _ not _ depend on the commensurability of the chain .",
    "because the fluid - sliding state is spatio - temporally chaotic it makes sense to introduce an effective _ temperature_. in the dimensionless units of the equation of motion ( [ int : eqm ] ) it is the average kinetic energy in the frame co - moving with the center of mass , i.e. , @xmath34 where @xmath16 is the average sliding velocity @xmath35 in the previous paper we have derived a formula for the applied force @xmath0 in terms of the first and second moments of the particle velocity [ eq .",
    "( ) in ref .  ] . with the help of this formula",
    "the temperature can be expressed in terms of the applied force and the average sliding velocity : @xmath36 figure  [ f.vf.chaos](b ) shows the temperatures of the fluid - sliding states of the velocity - force characteristic in fig .",
    "[ f.vf.chaos](a ) .    even though the temperature of the solid - sliding states and the stationary states is formally zero in accordance with ( [ stc : tf ] )",
    ", it does not make sense to call ( [ stc : t ] ) a `` temperature '' in regular , non - chaotic sliding states or stationary states .",
    "the periodic and quasi - periodic domain - like states , for example , investigated in the previous paper have also non - zero `` temperature '' .    in the frame co - moving with the center of mass , the chain is shaken by the washboard wave ( i.e. , the external potential ) and moves in a spatio - temporally chaotic way . the gaussian distributed velocities might suggest that the chain is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "but is it true ?",
    "this raises the following question of general interest : _ can we replace the spatio - temporally chaotic chain by an equivalent system which is in thermal equilibrium _ ? or more general , is it possible to describe the chaotic attractor of a weakly damped and strongly driven hamiltonian system with many degrees of freedom ( infinitely many in the thermodynamic limit ) by an equivalent undriven and undamped system ? as a consequence of a positive answer one would expect that the equipartition theorem from thermodynamics holds , i.e. the ensemble averages of @xmath37 and @xmath38 are independent of @xmath6 [ @xmath39 is the hamilton function , the @xmath40 s are the generalized coordinates , and the @xmath41 s are the corresponding canonical momenta ] . in numerical simulations",
    "one usually replaces the ensemble average by the temporal average assuming that the ergodicity hypothesis holds .",
    "an obvious candidate for a test of the equipartition theorem would be the particle momentum in the co - moving frame , i.e. , @xmath42 . but this is not a wise choice : because of symmetry the result has to independent of @xmath6 .",
    "a better choice is its spatial fourier transform , i.e. , @xmath43 that is , we want to check whether the average kinetic energy @xmath44 of the phonon modes is equipartitioned or not . figure  [ f.phmod ] shows that the equipartition theorem is not fulfilled @xcite .",
    "this is a clear signature for the fact that the _ fluid - sliding state is a state far away from thermal equilibrium_. therefore it is not possible to develop a theory for this state based on equilibrium thermodynamic .",
    "the violation of the equipartition theorem is equivalent with non - zero velocity correlations for @xmath45 because @xmath46 is the modulus of the fourier transform of @xmath22 .      when @xmath20 approaches an integer value the velocity - force characteristic of the fluid - sliding state develops a relatively sharp transition step at a characteristic value of the applied force @xmath0 .",
    "an example for @xmath47 is shown in figure  [ f.vf.chao2 ] . for long enough chains",
    "no hysteresis is observable . for small chains we get bistability between different types of sliding states .",
    "similar results has been found in a generalized fk model by braun _",
    "the aim of this section is to answer the following obvious questions : what is the nature of the different sliding states ?",
    "why does the bistability depends on @xmath10",
    "? can we understand this transition and where does it occur ?    first we take a more detailed look at the dynamics below and above the transition ( see fig .",
    "[ f.sst ] ) .",
    "the motion far below the threshold is almost regular .",
    "it corresponds to one of the multi - domain states we have discussed in the previous paper .",
    "there are two domain types , a stationary one with @xmath48 [ it is responsible for the tilted lines in fig .",
    "[ f.sst](a ) ] and a sliding one .",
    "often the sliding domains are so small that they are actually @xmath49-kinks , and larger sliding domains can be interpreted as clusters of @xmath49-kinks @xcite .",
    "that is , multi - domain states like the example of fig .",
    "[ f.sst](a ) are nonuniform distributions of @xmath49-kinks .",
    "thus , we call this state the _ kink - dominated sliding state_. note , that there are @xmath11 kinks but no antikink .",
    "it is well - known that kinks ( and antikinks ) can not travel faster than the sound velocity ( which is equal to one in our case ) .",
    "each kink or antikink needs therefore at least @xmath10 time units to travel through the whole chain . after that time",
    "a chain with @xmath11 kinks will be shifted by @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , the average sliding velocity of a state like the one of fig .",
    "[ f.sst](a ) has to be less than @xmath51 .",
    "[ f.vf.chao2 ] shows that it is actually much below the sound velocity .",
    "if the transition point is approached from below , the behavior depends on whether the chain is long or short . for long chains with many kinks ,",
    "the average sliding velocity @xmath16 starts to increase with @xmath0 faster and faster .",
    "later on the increase slows down .",
    "we define the transition point @xmath52 as the value of @xmath0 where the slope of @xmath53 has a maximum .",
    "after the transition point the system is in a fluid - sliding state [ see fig .",
    "[ f.sst](b ) ] .",
    "all kinks ( and antikinks ) have disappeared , and the system is completely spatio - temporally chaotic .",
    "a short chain with only a few kinks still stays in the kink - dominated regime beyond @xmath52 .",
    "eventually , it jumps to the fluid - sliding state or to the solid - sliding state ( see fig .",
    "[ f.vf.chao2 ] ) .",
    "a hysteresis occurs , and the chain goes back to the kink - dominated state at @xmath54 .    at the transition point the sliding velocity strongly fluctuates .",
    "these fluctuations set in already much below the transition point .",
    "they lead to a larger value of the average sliding velocity compared to the value for small chains .",
    "a typical example is shown in figure  [ f.fluct ] .",
    "one sees bursts of activity above a level given by the value of @xmath16 for small chains ( see fig .",
    "[ f.vf.chao2 ] ) .",
    "a detailed look onto the dynamics of the chain reveals that an increase of @xmath16 is caused by the _ production of kink - antikink pairs _",
    "these pairs usually appear behind a @xmath49-kink cluster",
    ". this may be the reason why for small chains the kink - dominated states survive beyond the transition point because the probability for a @xmath49-kink cluster is too small .",
    "each kink and antikink contributes to the sliding velocity of the chain .",
    "that is , @xmath16 is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the velocity of the kinks and antikinks and @xmath57 is the number of kink - antikink pairs . in the quiescent state without kink - antikink pairs ,",
    "the average sliding velocity is given by @xmath58 .",
    "thus the ratio @xmath59 gives directly the total number of kinks and antikinks ( i.e. , @xmath60 ) .",
    "figure  [ f.fluctd ] depicts the distribution of the sliding velocity shown in fig .",
    "[ f.fluct ] .",
    "in addition to the large peak at the quiescent state one sees clearly small peaks for @xmath61 and @xmath62 .    for @xmath12 approaching zero ( or any other integer multiple of @xmath49 ) the average sliding velocity of the kink - dominated sliding state also approaches zero .",
    "it disappears at @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the system goes from the fluid - sliding state directly to a stationary state when @xmath0 is decreased below the transition point @xmath52 .",
    "if the value of @xmath8 is not too large [ i.e. , @xmath63 , the stationary state will be the ground state @xcite .",
    "the transition is often accompanied by transients where a few kink - antikink pairs survive for a considerably long time .",
    "but in all simulations these pairs eventually disappeared .",
    "we found that the transition point @xmath52 is nearly independent of @xmath12 ( as long as @xmath20 is near an integer value ) .",
    "table  [ t.fsst ] shows that @xmath52 increases with @xmath8 weaker than linearly .    in order to understand the transition between the fluid - sliding state and the kink - dominated sliding state we compare the fk model with a simpler model , namely , one particle in a tilted spatially periodic potential plus additive white noise",
    "this model was studied in details by risken and vollmer @xcite .",
    "the single particle and the noise correspond to the center of mass of the fk model and the chaotic motion of the internal degrees of freedom , respectively .",
    "of course the noise is neither additive nor white .",
    "its strength depends on the state .",
    "it is obvious that the solid - sliding state and the stationary state of the fk model correspond to the running state and the locked state of the simple model in the absence of noise .",

    "the aim of this section is to take a closer look at the hysteresis loop between stationary states and the fluid - sliding state ( see fig .",
    "[ f.vf.chaos ] ) .",
    "there are two different types of transitions .",
    "a depinning - pinning transition where the ( chaotically ) sliding chain turns into a stationary one .",
    "it is a kind of nonequilibrium freezing and , as in usual first - order phase transitions , the chain can be `` supercooled '' below the transition point @xmath68 .",
    "that is , for @xmath0 slightly below @xmath68 the chain does not freeze immediately .",
    "it takes a while until a critical nucleus has appeared .",
    "the second transition is the pinning - depinning transition .",
    "the transition point @xmath69 depends on the stationary state and therefore on the history of the system . in an actual experiment where one sweeps through the hysteresis loop at a finite rate",
    ", one will therefore not get well - defined transitions points but more or less broad distributions .",
    "an example of such a ( numerical ) experiment is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ f.vf.chaos](a ) .",
    "it is typical that the distribution of @xmath68 is narrower than the distribution of @xmath69 . for a quasistatic sweep the distribution of @xmath70 becomes sharp , whereas the width of the distribution of @xmath71 is nearly independent on the sweeping rate .    from equilibrium thermodynamics it is well - known that melting and freezing occur at the same temperature and",
    "the transition is of first - order . in our case",
    "far from thermal equilibrium the situation is different . in the overdamped",
    "limit the pinning - depinning transition point @xmath69 is identical with the depinning - pinning transition @xmath68 but the transition is of second order @xcite . in the underdamped case we have bistability between sliding states and stationary states ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath72 .",
    "a further characteristic feature of nonequilibrium melting and freezing is the change of the effective temperature [ see e.g. fig .",
    "[ f.vf.chaos](b ) ] .",
    "this is a general property which is also found in similar models with nonzero temperature of the environment @xcite .",
    "that is , the fluid - sliding state has an effective temperature which is _ independent _ on the temperature of the environment as long as the latter one is considerably less than the former one .",
    "the effective temperature is a measure of the enhanced energy flow due to the excitation of phonons .",
    "we have studied in detail the depinning - pinning transition from a fluid - sliding state to a stationary state .",
    "we have chosen a value of @xmath12 where the fluid - sliding state is completely spatio - temporally chaotic .",
    "like in an ordinary first - order phase transition at thermal equilibrium the transition is caused by a _",
    "nucleation process_. that is , a small portion of the chain becomes stationary , and the fronts between this stationary nucleus and the sliding chain propagate into the chain .",
    "an example of such a nucleation process is shown in figure  [ f.nuc ] .",
    "one sees that states appear behind the fronts which can be characterized by an average particle distance @xmath12 ( or density @xmath73 ) which is roughly constant .",
    "note that the values of @xmath12 behind both fronts have to be different .",
    "this can be understood by the following argument . in the previous paper",
    "we have seen that because of the conservation of the number of particles the velocity of a front traveling from one particle to the next is given by @xmath74 , where the average particle distance and the average sliding velocity on both sides of the front are given by @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the chaotic sliding state is characterized by @xmath77 and @xmath78 . for the stationary state @xmath79 holds . in order to have fronts traveling in opposite directions ( see fig .",
    "[ f.nuc ] ) the average particle distances of the stationary states have to be different ( one larger than @xmath12 and one smaller than @xmath12 ) .",
    "we found that they are always the nearest integer multiples of @xmath80 , that is , for @xmath81 they are zero and @xmath80 . from this consideration",
    "it is clear that after the depinning - pinning transition the system can not be in the ground state @xcite which is characterized by a single domain with a uniform @xmath12 .",
    "instead the chain will be in a stationary _ two - domain state _ which is not quite perfect because each domain contains defects at low density .",
    "a similar depinning - pinning transition was found in a seemingly completely different model , namely , the quenched kadar - parisi - zhang equation with negative nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "it is a nonlinear diffusion equation which models the surface growth in disordered media . here",
    "the dissipation is strong and the randomness of the pinning landscape is important contrary to the weakly damped fk model .",
    "nevertheless the pinning - depinning transition is of first order and the state which freezes out of the sliding state is a two - domain state , as in the fk model ( compare fig .  2 of ref .   with fig .",
    "[ f.nuc ] ) .",
    "the duration of freezing @xmath82 is the sum of the nucleation time @xmath83 and the growth time @xmath84 .",
    "the nucleation time is the time that evolves until a critical nucleus appears .",
    "a critical nucleus is a nucleus which is large enough to grow into the fluid - sliding state .",
    "the nucleation time @xmath83 will be a poisson distribution if the probability for the appearance of a critical nucleus in a short time - step is small , i.e. , @xmath85 it is well - known that the average and the standard deviation of a poisson - distributed value are identical , i.e. , @xmath86 . for systems much larger than the critical nucleus , the probability for nucleation increases linearly with the system size , i.e. , @xmath87 .",
    "the time @xmath84 for a critical nucleus to grow up to the stationary state does not fluctuate as strongly as @xmath83 because it is roughly given by the system size divided by the sum of front velocities .",
    "thus @xmath88 .",
    "figure  [ f.poi ] shows that the nucleation process is indeed characterized by a poisson distribution with @xmath87 . from fits of the curves shown in fig .",
    "[ f.poi ] we found @xmath89 .",
    "one can also see a shift of the distribution for increasing @xmath10 to larger values of @xmath82 .",
    "this reflects the fact that @xmath90 increases with @xmath10 .    for values of @xmath12 between 2.45 and 3.09 ( and @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath54 ) we found that the fluid - sliding state changes its character .",
    "a domain appears where the particles are stationary ( with two particles per potential well ) .",
    "this domain which is surrounded by spatio - temporal chaos has a constant size and travels through the chain with a constant velocity .",
    "the transition from this so - called _ traffic - jam state _",
    "@xcite to a stationary one occurs also via nucleation .",
    "the critical nucleus seems to appear always at the back of the stationary domain .",
    "it reverses the propagation direction of the front .",
    "that is , the chaotic state stops traveling into the stationary one . instead a front propagates into the chaotic state leaving behind a stationary state different from the already existing one .",
    "thus the result is again a stationary two - domain state where one domain already exists at least partially before the transition .",
    "the nucleation probability is roughly independent of the system size @xmath10 because the nucleation site is predetermined .",
    "the transition from a stationary chain to a sliding one is the pinning - depinning transition .",
    "the transition point @xmath69 depends on the stationary state .",
    "it corresponds to a saddle - node bifurcation where the particular stationary state annihilates with an unstable stationary state . in the overdamped limit @xmath69",
    "is uniquely defined by the saddle - node bifurcation of the last stable stationary state which is usually the state which develops adiabatically out of the ground state for @xmath94 .",
    "the disappearances of the other stationary states in a saddle - node bifurcation lead only to more or less local rearrangements of the chain .",
    "we call such a rearrangements a _ micro - slip_. a micro - slip changes the center of mass of the chain but does not lead to sliding .",
    "an example is shown in figure  [ f.mslip ] .",
    "this behavior and the statistics of micro - slips has been studied mainly in models with random external potential @xcite .    in the underdamped regime",
    "the energy gained from a local rearrangement is not dissipated immediately .",
    "this may lead to an avalanche which turns the whole system into a sliding state . whether a saddle - node bifurcation leads to a micro - slip or to a transition to sliding depends on the stationary state and on the damping constant @xmath7 . for",
    "each stationary state one can presumably find a critical value @xmath95 which distinguishes both cases : for @xmath96 we get a micro - slip , otherwise a transition to sliding . in our simulations we found only a few ( not more than three ) micro - slips for @xmath92 and @xmath91 .",
    "the pinning - depinning transition point depends strongly on the history of the system because the actual value of @xmath69 depends on the stationary state .",
    "sweeping several times through the pinning - depinning hysteresis loops , we find a broad distribution of @xmath69 even for very small sweep rates .",
    "in this paper we have shown that in the _ weakly _ damped and strongly driven fk model spatio - temporal chaos appears .",
    "this chaotic state , called _ fluid - sliding state _ , has an effective temperature which reflects the fact that phonons are excited .",
    "this has to be contrasted by the solid - sliding state where no phonons are excited @xcite .",
    "the excitation of phonons opens up additional channels of dissipation .",
    "thus friction in the fluid - sliding state is larger than in the solid - sliding state .",
    "the velocity - force characteristic shows a pronounced transition if the average particle distance @xmath12 is near but not identical to an integer multiple of the period of the external potential .",
    "it is a transition between the kink - dominated sliding state and the fluid - sliding state . below the transition point @xmath52 sliding",
    "is caused by the propagation of @xmath49 kinks .",
    "approaching the transition point from below leads to an increasing production of kink - antikink pairs . above the transition point",
    "all kinks and antikinks disappear and the chain is in the fluid - sliding state with an average sliding velocity which depends only weakly on the average particle density @xmath73 . in the kink - dominated regime",
    "the average sliding velocity is proportional to @xmath97 .",
    "the transition point @xmath52 is roughly independent of @xmath12 . for small values of @xmath8",
    "it is very well approximated by the transition point between the running and locked solution of an ( @xmath19)-fk model with infinitesimally small additive white noise [ i.e. eq .  ( [ sst : f2 ] ) ] .",
    "this raises the question whether the dynamics can be reduced to a center - of - mass motion plus some nontrivial ( e.g. colored , state - dependent ) noise term .",
    "the nonequilibrium freezing ( i.e. , the transition from sliding to stationarity ) of the fluid - sliding state is a nucleation process .",
    "the resulting stationary state has two domains of different particle densities .    the nonequilibrium melting ( i.e. , the transition from a stationary state to sliding ) of such a stationary state corresponds to a saddle - node bifurcation where the stationary and , of course , the stable state annihilates with its unstable counterpart . in the case of nonzero environmental temperature",
    "the transition occurs a bit earlier because thermal activation overcomes the barrier which decreases to zero at the saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "not all saddle - node bifurcations lead to melting .",
    "they may lead to a local rearrangement of the particle configuration called micro - slip .",
    "the pinning - depinning transition point depends on the history because each stationary state has another bifurcation point .",
    "our results are qualitatively very similar to results of similar models .",
    "persson studied a two - dimensional lennard - jones liquid on a corrugated potential with square symmetry at a nonzero temperature @xcite .",
    "he varied the temperature between @xmath98 and @xmath99 of the melting temperature ( the thermal energy was roughly a tenth of activation energy for single particle diffusion ) .",
    "he obtained velocity - force characteristics and effective temperature plots similar to fig  [ f.vf.chaos ] . because of the relatively high temperature of the environment he did not find hysteresis between the solid - sliding state and the fluid - sliding state . as in the fk model , the transition from the fluid - sliding state to a stationary state is also a nucleation process .",
    "persson found that it occurs when the effective temperature is equal to the melting temperature at thermal equilibrium . because the velocity distribution of the fluid - sliding state was gaussian",
    ", he argued that the fluid - sliding state is in a kind of thermal equilibrium .",
    "therefore it has to freeze below the melting temperature .",
    "but as we have seen in sec .",
    "[ stc ] , gaussian distributed velocities do not imply a quasi - thermal equilibrium .",
    "it would be interesting to look whether in persson s model the equipartition theorem of the phonon modes is fulfilled or not .",
    "this is clearly a better test on thermal equilibrium .",
    "granato _ et al .",
    "_ studied a two - dimensional frenkel - kontorova model at nonzero temperatures @xcite .",
    "the external potential is corrugated only in the direction of the applied force .",
    "also the particles can move only in this direction .",
    "they did the simulations at a temperature which corresponds to @xmath100 of the activation energy and which is roughly @xmath101 of the melting temperature .",
    "they also found a behavior like in fig .",
    "[ f.vf.chaos ] again without a hysteresis between the solid - sliding state and fluid - sliding state .",
    "they also confirmed the observation of persson that the transition from sliding to stationarity occurs at the melting temperature .",
    "braun _ et al .",
    "_ investigated a generalized fk model that is quite similar to the model studied by persson @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that the substrate potential is anharmonic and the interaction potential is an exponential repulsion .",
    "they did the simulations mainly for two different temperatures which correspond to @xmath102 and @xmath103 of the activation energy for single particle diffusion .",
    "they report results for one - dimensional chains of atoms as well as for two - dimensional layers .",
    "there seems to be no qualitative differences between one and two dimension . again",
    "velocity - force characteristics and effective temperature plots are similar to our results .",
    "they found a hysteresis between solid sliding and fluid sliding .",
    "its width decreases with the environmental temperature and disappears eventually ( at a temperature which is roughly @xmath101 of the activation barrier for hopping of uncoupled single particles ) .",
    "near fully commensurate particle densities they found a transition ( denoted by @xmath104 ) which is similar to the transition from the kink - dominated sliding regime to the fluid - sliding regime of the fk model . because their chain was short ( i.e. , @xmath105 ) this transition shows hysteresis for very low temperatures . instead of a fully chaotic fluid - sliding regime they always found two - domain states with alternatively running and locked particles ( traffic - jam regime ) .",
    "they also measured the transition point @xmath104 as function of the damping constant @xcite .",
    "it increases roughly linear with the damping constant but the authors seemed not to be aware that ( [ sst : f2 ] ) is again a remarkable good approximation ( i.e. errors are less than 10% ) for @xmath104 .",
    "we thank h. thomas for critical reading of the manuscript .",
    "we also acknowledge the possibility to do simulations on the nec sx-3 and sx-4 at the centro svizzero di calcolo scientifico at manno , switzerland .",
    "this work was supported by the swiss national science foundation .                                    by the way , we checked in microcanonical simulations of the thermal equlibrium ( i.e. , no damping , @xmath106 , no driving , @xmath94 ) , that for the same values of @xmath8 and @xmath107 as in fig .",
