    "the ferromagnetic systems with weak disorder ( e.g. with small concentration of non - magnetic impurities ) are under intensive study during last four decades .",
    "as the disorder of this type can not destroy the ferromagnetic ground state , most of the efforts ( both theoretical , experimental and numerical ) were concentrated on the critical properties of such systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) where even weak disorder was proved to be `` relevant variable '' .",
    "it turns out that the presence of quenched disorder can essentially modify the critical behavior of the system such that new universal critical exponents may set in .",
    "another interesting phenomena which appear due to quenched randomness in the ising ferromagnet are the so called griffiths singularities in the thermodynamical functions @xcite .",
    "apart from these two big issues the effects produced by weak quenched disorder on thermodynamical properties of a ferromagnet ( away from the critical point ) were usually considered as more or less irrelevant corrections to the pure case .",
    "the aim of the present study is to demonstrate that due to the presence of weak disorder the statistical properties of ( random ) free energy of the ising ferromagnet are getting rather non - trivial .",
    "of course , in the thermodynamic limit due to self - averaging the free energy distribution function turns into the @xmath2-function .",
    "however , if the volume of the system is large but finite ( which , in particular , is the case in numerical simulations ) the situation is much more complicated . away from the critical point at scales much bigger than the correlation length @xmath3 the system could be considered as a set of more or less independent regions with the size @xmath3 . in this case",
    "one would naively expect that the free energy distribution function must be gaussian .",
    "in fact this is not the case .",
    "it can be shown that besides the central gaussian part this distribution has asymmetric and essentially non - gaussian tails .",
    "approaching the critical point one finds that the range of validity of the gaussian `` body '' shrinks while the `` tails '' are getting of the same order as the `` body '' .",
    "moreover , if we naively imitate the critical point by assuming that the correlation length becomes of the order of the system size we formally find that the free energy distribution function turns into a universal curve .    in our present study the ising ferromagnet with quenched disorder will be considered in terms of the random temperature @xmath0-dimensional ginzburg - landau hamiltonian : @xmath4 = \\int d^{d}{\\bf x } \\bigl[\\frac{1}{2 } \\bigl(\\nabla \\phi({\\bf x})\\bigr)^{2 } + \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\tau - \\xi({\\bf x } ) ) \\phi^{2}({\\bf x } ) + \\frac{1}{4 } g_{o } \\ , \\phi^{4}({\\bf x } ) \\bigr]\\ ] ] where independent random quenched parameters @xmath5 are described by the gaussian distribution function @xmath6 \\ ; = \\ ; \\prod_{{\\bf x } } \\biggl[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi u_{0 } } }   \\exp\\bigl(-\\frac{1}{4u_{o } } \\xi^{2}({\\bf x } ) \\bigr ) \\biggr]\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the parameter which describes the strength of the disorder , @xmath8 . in what follows",
    "it will be supposed that the disorder is weak : @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "for a given realization of the disorder the partition function of the considered system is @xmath11 \\ ; = \\ ; \\int { \\cal d } \\phi \\ ; \\exp\\bigl(-h\\bigl[\\phi,\\xi\\bigr]\\bigr ) \\ ; = \\ ;   \\exp\\bigl(-f\\bigl[\\xi\\bigr]\\bigr)\\ ] ] where @xmath12 denotes the integration over all configurations of the fields @xmath13 and @xmath14 $ ] is the free energy of the system .",
    "the distribution function of the random quantity @xmath14 $ ] can be analyzed by studying the moments of the partition function .",
    "taking the integer @xmath15-th power of the expression in eq.([3 ] ) and averaging over the disorder parameters @xmath5 ( with the gaussian distribution , eq.([2 ] ) ) we get the replica partition function @xmath16 } \\ ; \\equiv z(n ) \\ ; =   \\int { \\cal d } \\phi_{1 } ... \\int { \\cal d } \\phi_{n } \\exp\\bigl(-h_{n}\\bigl[\\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\bigr]\\bigr)\\ ] ] where the replica hamiltonian @xmath17 \\ ; = \\ ;   \\int d^{d}{\\bf x } \\bigl [ \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{a=1}^{n}\\bigl(\\nabla \\phi_{a}({\\bf x})\\bigr)^{2 } + \\frac{1}{2 } \\tau \\sum_{a=1}^{n } \\phi_{a}^{2}({\\bf x } ) + \\frac{1}{4 } \\sum_{a , b=1}^{n }   g_{ab } \\ , \\phi_{a}^{2}({\\bf x } ) \\phi_{b}^{2}({\\bf x})\\bigr]\\ ] ] depends on @xmath15 interacting fields @xmath18 , and the coupling @xmath19 matrix @xmath20 taking into account the definition of the free energy in eq.([3 ] ) , the replica partition function , eq.([4 ] ) , can also be represented as follows , @xmath21\\bigr ) } \\ ] ] or @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a free energy distribution function .",
    "usually the replica partition function , eq.([4 ] ) , is studied for deriving the average value of the free energy .",
    "the heuristic ( not well justified ) procedure of the replica calculations requires to perform the analytic continuation of the function @xmath24 from integer to arbitrary values of the replica parameter @xmath15 .",
    "then , taking the limit @xmath25 in both sides of eq.([8 ] ) ( and taking into account that @xmath26 ) we formally get @xmath27    in fact if we are interested not just in the average free energy of the system but in the properties of its distribution function the situation even with weak disorder turns out to be rather nontrivial . considering the system away from the critical point",
    "one would naively expect that at least at scales greater than the correlation length ( where the system is expected to split into a set of more or less independent `` cells '' of the size of the correlation length ) `` everything must be gaussian distributed '' .",
    "one can easily prove that this is not true .",
    "indeed , let us consider the coupling matrix @xmath28 , eq([6 ] ) .",
    "it has @xmath29 eigenvalues @xmath30 and one eigenvalue @xmath31 .",
    "we see that for @xmath32 the eigenvalue @xmath33 is getting negative .",
    "thus , according to eqs.([4])-([5 ] ) , we find that all moments of the partition function @xmath24 with @xmath32 must be divergent ! on the other hand , according to the relation ( [ 8 ] ) this indicate that the free energy distribution function of the considered system can not be gaussian .",
    "moreover , since it is evident that the divergency in the integration in the rhs of eq.([8 ] ) takes place in the limit @xmath34 , we can easily guess that the left asymptotic of the distribution function @xmath23 has the following simple form : @xmath35 it should be stressed that this phenomenon must be quite general : it take place for any dimension of the system independently of the value of the temperature parameter @xmath36 ( except for the critical point ) both in paramagnetic and in the ferromagnetic phases .",
    "to analyze the properties of the free energy distribution function of a random ferromagnet one can start with very simple `` toy '' model .",
    "let us consider the system described by the hamiltonian containing only one degree of freedom : @xmath37 the random quenched parameter @xmath38 is described by the gaussian distribution function @xmath39 and its typical value @xmath8 is supposed to be small , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . besides , to simplify the calculations it will be assumed that the coupling parameter @xmath40 is also small , @xmath41 .      to simplify notations let us redefine : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",

    "we get : @xmath49 on the other hand , @xmath50\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is a free energy distribution function .",
    "the above relation is the bilateral laplace transform . performing analytic continuation of the function @xmath52 from integer @xmath15 to arbitrary complex values , by inverse laplace",
    "transform we obtain : @xmath53\\ ] ] under conditions @xmath54 one can easily perform ( approximate ) calculations of the partition function , eq.([13 ] ) . for @xmath55",
    "the main contribution in the integration over @xmath56 comes from the vicinity of the point @xmath57 . on the other hand , at @xmath58 the integral",

    ".    finally , substituting eqs.([19])-([20 ] ) into eq.([16 ] ) ( where the integration contour can be chosen to be just the imaginary axes , @xmath66 ) we obtain @xmath67 \\\\ \\nonumber \\\\ & = &   \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } \\frac{d\\xi}{\\sqrt{4\\pi u } } \\exp\\bigl[-\\frac{1}{4u } \\xi^{2}\\bigr ] \\ ; \\delta\\bigl(f - f_{para}(\\xi)\\bigr ) \\label{21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] right part of this distribution function @xmath68 valid for @xmath69 is defined by the region @xmath70 , where @xmath71 . using eq.([21 ] ) we get @xmath72\\ ] ] in the vicinity of the point @xmath73 the above distribution has the gaussian form : @xmath74\\ ] ] however , the above form of the distribution is valid only for @xmath75 . for large ( positive ) values of the free energy",

    "thus , according to eqs.([43 ] ) , ( [ 45 ] ) and ( [ 48 ] ) for the entire free energy distribution function of the random ising ferromagnet ( in the paramagnetic phase away from the critical point ) we find the following result : @xmath159   ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\mbox{for } \\ ;   f \\gg \\frac{v}{r_{c}^d }                      \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where ( in the framework of the mean - field scaling theory ) @xmath160 is the correlation length , @xmath114 is the volume of the system , @xmath161 is the rescaled strength of the disorder , eq.([2 ] ) , and @xmath162 is the rescaled coupling constant of the original ginsburg - landau hamiltonian , eq.([1 ] ) .    one can easily repeat similar calculations for the free energy distribution function in the ferromagnetic phase to obtain the result similar to eq.([49 ] ) .",
    "the only difference is that in this case the gaussian central part of the distribution will be concentrated around the ferromagnetic ground state energy @xmath163 .",
    "one can easily note at least three apparent consequences of the obtained result , eq.([49 ] ) , for the free energy distribution function of the random ising ferromagnet .",
    "second . at large but finite volume of the system in addition to the trivial gaussian `` body '' the distribution function exhibits essentially non - gaussian tails",
    "moreover , these tails are strongly asymmetric : the left tail , at @xmath34 , is much slower that the right one , at @xmath164 .",
    "it is this type of asymmetry of the free energy distribution function ( the left tail is slow while the right tail is fast ) which is observed in others random systems @xcite it is interesting to note that the result , eq.([49 ] ) , has to be very general taking place at all temperatures ( except for the critical region ) and in all dimensions . on the other hand the behavior of each tail ( both left and right ) looks rather universal .",
    "indeed , at large negative values of the free energy the logarithm of the distribution function is expected to be _ linear _ in @xmath165 , while at large positive energies , it is the _ double logarithm _ of the distribution function which is expected to be linear in @xmath166 .",
    "presumably these two types of asymptotics could be relatively easy recovered by computer simulations .    third . while approaching the critical point we observe that the range of validity of the gaussian `` body '' of the distribution function shrinks while the `` tails '' are getting of the same order as the `` body ''",
    "of course , simple mean - field calculations considered in this paper are not valid in the critical point .",
    "nevertheless , if we naively imitate the critical point by assuming that the correlation length becomes of the order of the system size ( i.e. @xmath167 ) while the coupling parameters @xmath168 and @xmath169 ( in dimension @xmath170 ) become equal to their universal ( depending only of the dimension @xmath0 ) fixed point values @xmath171 and @xmath172 , @xcite we find that ( in the thermodynamic limit @xmath173 ) the free energy distribution function turns into the _ universal _ curve such that @xmath174   ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\mbox{for } \\ ;   f \\gg 1                      \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] all that evokes the old idea that free energy ( as well as some others thermodynamic quantities ) of the random ferromagnets could be non self - averaging in the critical point @xcite .",
    "of course , the systematic derivation of the free energy distribution function in the critical point requires a special consideration .",
