    "the da@xmath0ne @xmath8 @xcite is successfully running in frascati since 1999 .",
    "it s particular design , with two different rings intersecting only in the two interaction regions , was intended to reach the extremely high luminosity of @xmath9 , allowing 120 bunches per ring with a lifetime of 2 hours and an average luminosity of 5 @xmath10 per year .    during the year 2002 , in the kloe interaction region",
    ", a luminosity of @xmath1 has been reached using 45 bunches per ring .",
    "beam lifetime has reached the 40 minutes .",
    "the total integrated luminosity , optimized by injecting new bunches during the data taking , has been of 0.3 @xmath10 in 140 days corresponding to @xmath11 , more than the double of what had been obtained in 2001 .    in the last months of year 2002 , in the other interaction region ,",
    "the dear experiment has collected 77 @xmath12 with a maximum luminosity of @xmath13 and 100 bunches circulating in each ring @xcite .    in the year",
    "2003 major changes have taken place in da@xmath0ne optics , in particular for the kloe interaction region the layout of the low beta permanent quadrupoles has been substantially modified for easier tuning of the machine .    the new da@xmath0ne setup aims to reach a luminosity of @xmath14 .",
    "the finuda experiment has been installed in the interaction region previuosly occupied by the dear experiment .    in the fall of 2003 kloe",
    "will restart taking data with the aim of collecting 2 @xmath10 before the end of 2004 .",
    "the analysis of the data already collected by the dear and kloe experiments has produced the results that will be shown in the following .",
    "the dear ( @xmath15 ) experiment @xcite has the goal of measuring the isospin dependent antikaon - nucleon scattering lengths , @xmath5 and @xmath16 , via the measurement of the @xmath17 line shift ( @xmath18 ) and width ( @xmath19 ) in kaonic hydrogen and deuterium .    from the deser - trueman formulas @xcite one has for kaonic hydrogen :    @xmath20    and for kaonic",
    "deuterium :    @xmath21    and , extracting @xmath22 from @xmath23 , one gets :    @xmath24    these amplitudes give crucial informations about the meson - nucleon sigma terms and the strangeness content of the proton .      the experimental setup contains a pressurized cryogenic target cell with a diameter of 11 cm and a thickness of 75 @xmath25 m of kapton where the kaons , produced in the @xmath0 decays , are stopped and captured to form kaonic atoms .",
    "the photons produced in the de - excitation of these atoms are detected by 16 ccd-55 ( _ charged coupled devices _ ) .    in a first period of data taking a nitrogen target",
    "has been used to tune up the apparatus : the yield of kaonic nitrogen transitions is indeed 20 times higher than the kaonic hydrogen ones .    using the @xmath26 collected in the october 2002 ,",
    "the yields of the following 3 transitions have been measured for the first time ( fig.[dearkn ] ) , obtaining the following results@xcite :    @xmath27    [ thb ]    using the kn data the feasibility of a precision measurement of the charged kaon mass has also been proved@xcite .    in december 2002 , dear has collected @xmath28 with an hydrogen target to measure the @xmath17 line of kh .",
    "in addition , background data with no collision , equivalent to @xmath29 in collision , have been collected for the study of the background .",
    "two different analyses based on the global fit of the kh spectrum before and after background subtraction have given as preliminary results for the @xmath17 line shift and width@xcite :    @xmath30      an upgrade of the dear experiment called siddharta ( silicon drift detector for hadronic atoms resarch by timing application ) is under study .",
    "the new setup will use fast triggerable devices , namely silicon drift detectors , the trigger being given by the charged kaons entering the cell .",
    "a precision at the ev level is aimed on @xmath17 lines of kaonic hydrogen and deuterium .",
    "the observation of other exotic atoms will also be possible .",
    "kloe ( k long experiment ) is a general purpose detector @xcite whose characteristics have been optimized for the study of the cp violating decays of the neutral kaons .",
    "the main components of the detector are ( fig.[kloedet ] ) :    * a _ superconducting solenoid _ giving a magnetic field of 0.52 t. * the _ drift chamber _",
    "@xcite : a cylindrical shape ( @xmath31=4 m , @xmath32=3.3 m ) filled with a gas mixture , 90% he+10% isobutane , instrumented with 12582 stereo sense wires .",
    "it gives a momentum resolution @xmath33% for tracks with @xmath34 mev and @xmath35 .",
    "the spatial resolution is 150 @xmath25 m in the radial direction and 2 mm in the longitudinal one . *",
    "the _ electromagnetic calorimeter _",
    "@xcite : it s a 15@xmath36 sampling calorimeter with lead and scintillating fibers read at both sides by photomultipliers . with its cylindrical shape it covers 98% of the solid angle .",
    "the energy resolution is @xmath37 .",
    "the time resolution is @xmath38 .",
    "the spatial resolution for completely neutral vertices , e.g. @xmath39 , reconstructed inside the drift chamber is @xmath40 cm . *",
    "the _ quadrupole calorimeter _ @xcite : two smaller sampling calorimeters with lead and scintillating tiles , surrounding the low @xmath41 quadrupoles to complete the calorimetric hermeticity .",
    "[ tbh ]      most of the @xmath0 mesons decay in charged kaons ( 49% ) or neutral kaons ( 34% ) , so that kaon physics is the largest part of kloe program .    other particles , produced in @xmath0 decays with enough abudance to improve the existing experimental measurements , are @xmath2 ( @xmath4215% ) , @xmath3 ( @xmath421.3% ) , @xmath4 ( @xmath43 ) , @xmath5 ( @xmath43 ) and @xmath6 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "furthermore , thanks to the _ radiative return _ that reduces the center of mass energy of the colliding beams , kloe can measure the hadronic cross section , @xmath44 , in the crucial region from the @xmath45 threshold to the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "results presented in the following are obtained from the analysis of 2000 data ( 25 @xmath12 ) and , in some cases , from the preliminary analysis of 2001 ( 170 @xmath12 ) and 2002 ( 280 @xmath12 ) data .",
    "kaons are produced at a @xmath0-factory in a pure antisymmetric initial state with quantum numbers @xmath46 . at da@xmath0ne",
    "the @xmath0 mesons are produced pratically at rest , with only a small momentum ( @xmath4213 mev / c ) in the plane of the orbit , so that the kaons are produced practically back to back .    in the case of neutral kaons",
    "one has :    @xmath47    this simultaneous production allows for a clean tagging of @xmath48(@xmath49 ) looking at the @xmath49(@xmath48 ) on the other side , having also a precise information on the tagged kaon momentum .",
    "the two main tagging algorithms in kloe are :    * @xmath50 * tagged * by @xmath49 interaction in the calorimeter ( @xmath51 ) : @xmath49 interactions are identified using the time of flight and some additional request on the energy deposit@xcite . the tagging efficiency , mostly geometrical , is @xmath52% .",
    "the @xmath48 momentum is obtained with a resolution of @xmath53 mev and an angular resolution of @xmath54 ( @xmath55 in @xmath56 ) .",
    "* @xmath57 * tagged * by @xmath58 vertex close to the interaction point : @xmath48 decays are identified asking for the @xmath48 invariant mass and momentum .",
    "tagging efficiency , mainly geometrical , is @xmath59% .",
    "the resolution on @xmath49 momentum is @xmath53 mev and the angular resolution is @xmath54 .",
    "using just the @xmath60 @xmath61 tagged @xmath48 from 17@xmath62 collected in 2000 , kloe has measured the ratio of the partial widths of the main @xmath48 decay modes@xcite :    @xmath63    the measurement is fully inclusive with respect to the radiated photon energy .",
    "the ratio in ( [ ksratio ] ) is important not only because it enters in the _",
    "double ratio _ used to measure @xmath64 , but also because it can be used to derive the strong phases in the amplitudes @xmath65 , investigating the presence of _ isospin - breaking _ electromagnetic phase shifts .",
    "other interesting @xmath48 branching ratios measured by kloe are : @xmath66    the results are obtained from a still preliminary analysis of 170 @xmath12 collected in 2001 and are consistent with the ones published using the 2000 data sample @xcite .    combining the results in ( [ brksen ] )",
    "one gets the first preliminary measurement of @xmath48 semileptonic asymmetry : @xmath67    this asymmetry can be compared with the value of the @xmath49 semileptonic asymmetry @xcite to perform a nice test of cpt conservation .",
    "@xmath48 semileptonic decays can also be used to test the @xmath68 rule which forbids decays like @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath70 violation is commonly expressed via : @xmath71    if cpt holds , @xmath70 implies @xmath72 .",
    "the standard model allows @xmath70 violation only at next to leading order predicting @xmath73 .",
    "kloe preliminary result ( 2001 data sample ) is : @xmath74    in agreement with the comparabale result obtained by cplear @xcite .",
    "using an energy scan around the @xmath0 peak , kloe has also measured the @xmath48 mass@xcite : @xmath75 by normalizing the energy scale to the precise determination of the @xmath0 mass obtained by resonant beam depolarisation at novosibirsk@xcite .",
    "@xmath49 neutral decays are reconstructed using the momentum information obtained from the @xmath76 vertex and the time and position of the energy deposited in the calorimeter by the photons produced in the decays .",
    "these informations are sufficient to completely reconstruct neutral vertices like @xmath77 or @xmath78 with a spatial resolution of @xmath40 cm .",
    "exploiting the simple dynamics of the @xmath79 decay it s possible to obtain a precise measurement of the corresponding branching ratio@xcite ( 362 @xmath12 analyzed ) :    @xmath80    in agreement with the recent na48 result@xcite .",
    "preliminary results on @xmath49 charged decays are also in good agreement with the pdg values@xcite .",
    "in particular , a final error much better than 1% is expected on @xmath81 decays , improving the error on the kaon form factors ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) , the @xmath49 lifetime ( @xmath84 ) and , finally , on the ckm matrix element @xmath85 .",
    "charged kaons are tagged using the two body decays into @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "again one kaon is tagged looking at the other kaon on the opposite side .",
    "using the momentum and time of flight informations obtained by the drift chamber and the calorimeter it s possible to isolate the different decay channels@xcite .",
    "in particular for the @xmath88 channel one gets : @xmath89    looking at the charge asymmetries of the slopes of the dalitz plot for this channel it s possible to have an evidence of direct cp violation in charged kaon decays .",
    "a preliminary fit of the dalitz plot with just @xmath90 has obtained : @xmath91      from the fit of the dalitz plot for the @xmath92 decays , it s possible to obtain the @xmath2-meson parameters for its three charge states and the cross section for @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "the result obtained with 17 @xmath12 from 2000 data sample is@xcite : @xmath95    using 2000 data kloe has also measured the relative branching ratio for @xmath0 decays in @xmath96 and @xmath97@xcite : @xmath98 from where one can extract the pseudoscalar mixing angle ( @xmath99 ) and the gluon content in @xmath4 ( @xmath100 ) : @xmath101    scalar mesons are detected at kloe through their decay channels : @xcite and @xmath102 @xcite . from the integration of the @xmath103 and @xmath104 mass spectra of 2001 and 2002 , these preliminary updated branching ratios are found : @xmath105 a fit of the dalitz plots to extract the @xmath5 and @xmath6 contributions is in progress .      the determination of hadronic cross section @xmath106 in the energy region from @xmath45 threshold to the @xmath0 resonance is still one of the main source of error for the theoretical estimate of the muon anomaly ( @xmath107 ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent results obtained in this region from @xmath108 and @xmath109 data show an inconsistency of some percent @xcite .    despite of the fact that da@xmath0ne runs at fixed energy , @xmath110 , kloe can measure the hadronic cross section via the _ radiative return_@xcite : initial state radiation ( isr ) from the beams can lower the value of @xmath111 down to the @xmath112 threshold .    kloe @xmath113 events are selected asking for two charged tracks coming from the interaction region with an angle respect to the beam pipe @xmath114 .",
    "additional cuts on the momentum , @xmath115 mev or @xmath116 mev , are used to reject tracks spiraling along the beam line .    in order to suppress the events in which the @xmath45 invariant mass is reduced by the presence of a final state radiated ( fsr ) photon , a cut on the missing momentum angle , @xmath117 ,",
    "is imposed .",
    "background from bhabha scattering , @xmath92 decays and @xmath118 events is suppressed using a particle identification method based on the time of flight , the energy deposit in the calorimeter and the kinematic closure of the event in the hypothesis of only one photon in the final state@xcite .",
    "residual background is evaluated from the fit of the mass distribution of the charged particles and subtracted .",
    "the yield of the selection is @xmath119 .",
    "the cross section is obtained by dividing for the luminosity measured with large angle bhabha events using the babayaga generator@xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 cross section is obtained from the @xmath120 cross section by dividing for the _ radiation function _ ( fig.[shad].a ) given by the phokhara event generator@xcite used with @xmath121 and vacuum polarization off and multiplying by the appropriate kinematic factor .    after correcting for the vacuum polarization the bare @xmath7 cross section shown in fig.[shad].b",
    "is obtained .",
    "[ thb ]    the corresponding preliminary value for the @xmath45 contribution to @xmath107 in the interval @xmath122 is : @xmath123 where the theoretical error comes from the knowledge of the radiation function , of the vacuum polarization and of the bhabha cross section used to determine the luminosity .",
    "the result ( [ amu ] ) is in good agreement with the one obtained by cmd2 with the energy scan method@xcite and confirms a discrepancy with @xmath109 data .",
