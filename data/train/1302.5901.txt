    "<S> the latter gives a zeeman - like interaction for valley which breaks the valley symmetry in contrast to  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> next , we introduce the effect of pgv which leads to shifts in chemical potentials of three sublayers consisting of one mo and two s layers . </S>",
    "<S> we show that pgv leads to a splitting of two high energy bands originating from @xmath2 orbitals of s atoms . </S>",
    "<S> one of our main findings is the possibility of tailoring the band gap , effective masses and the valley splitting of the valence and conduction bands by varying the induced potentials in three sublayers .    _ </S>",
    "<S> theory and model _  ml - mds consists of one layer of mo atoms surrounded by two layers of s atoms in a way that each mo atom is coordinated by six s atoms in a trigonal prismatic geometry and each s atom is coordinated by three mo atoms . </S>",
