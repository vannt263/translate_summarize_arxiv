    "few problems have been studied so extensively over the last decades as the one devised originally by e. fermi , j. pasta and s. ulam ( fpu ) in 1954 @xcite .",
    "their purpose was to check numerically that a generic but very simple non - linear many particle dynamical system would indeed behave for large times as a statistical mechanical system , that is it would approach equilibrium . in particular their purpose was to obtain the usual equipartition of energy over all the degrees of freedom of a system , for generic initial conditions .",
    "to their surprise , for the system fpu considered - a one dimensional anharmonic chain of 32 or 64 particles with fixed ends and in addition to harmonic , cubic ( @xmath0-model ) or quartic ( @xmath6-model ) anharmonic forces between nearest neighbors - this was not observed .",
    "a variety of manifestly non - equilibrium and non - equipartition behaviors was seen , including quasiperiodic recurrences to the initial state .",
    "in fact , a behavior reminiscent of that of a dynamical system with few degrees of freedom was found , rather than the expected statistical mechanical behavior .",
    "the duration of their calculations varied between 10000 and 82500 computation steps .",
    "these results raised the fundamental question about the validity or at least the generally assumed applicability of statistical mechanics to non - linear systems of which the system considered by fpu seemed to be a typical example .",
    "most of the attempts to clarify this difficulty have approached the problem as one in dynamical systems .",
    "these analyses have revealed many very interesting properties of the fpu system and uncovered a number of possible explanations for the resolution of the observed conflict with statistical mechanics .",
    "the classical explanations are : _",
    "i ) _ the survival of invariant tori in the phase space of a quasi - integrable system ( kam theory ) @xcite , _ ii ) _ the existence of zabusky and kruskal s solitons in the kdv continuum limit @xcite , _ iii ) _ the existence of an order - to - chaos transition @xcite .",
    "however , we do not believe that the problem has as yet been entirely resolved . in particular",
    ", it is the purpose of this paper to try to clarify the problem from a statistical mechanical point of view .",
    "that is , we will try to exhibit the reasons why this apparently bona fide statistical mechanical system did not behave as such and , in particular , what in our opinion the significance of this apparent failure is for the general validity of statistical mechanics .",
    "there are a number of obvious questions related to the unstatistical mechanical behavior observed by fpu , which all address the generic nature of their results :    \\a ) was their time of integration long enough ?",
    "\\b ) was their dynamical system of @xmath7 or @xmath8 particles in one dimension large enough , i.e. possessing a sufficient number of degrees of freedom , to qualify as a statistical mechanical system ?",
    "\\c ) were the recurrence phenomena ( to within @xmath9 ) observed by fpu , transient or generic , i.e. possibly related to a poincar recurrence time ?",
    "the search for answers to these questions made the work of fpu very seminal , spawning many new developments and connections in the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems , such as the connection with continuum models based on the korteweg - de vries equation , leading to solitons @xcite , heavy breathers etc . , or with few degrees of freedom models like the hnon - heiles and the toda lattice @xcite .",
    "for a recent review we refer to @xcite .",
    "the approach to equilibrium of the fpu - @xmath6 model was studied extensively for various classes of initial conditions by kantz _",
    "_ @xcite and recently by de luca _ et al .",
    "a very detailed picture has emerged from their work , as to the behavior of the fpu-@xmath6 model in its dependence on non - equilibrium initial conditions as well as the role played by low frequency and high frequency mode - mode couplings @xcite during its time evolution .",
    "two threshold energies were identified , but the connection of all the very interesting and detailed information obtained with the generic statistical mechanical behavior of the fpu-@xmath6 model remains unclear so far .",
    "thus , although the effort to resolve the so - called fpu problem has led to enormous advances in our understanding of non linear dynamical systems , it has not yet , in our opinion , led to a full evaluation of the statistical mechanical relevance of the fpu paradox , i.e. fpu s original question has not yet really been answered .",
    "it is commonly asserted @xcite that the kam theorem provides the essential answer to fpu s observations , i.e. , for sufficiently small nonlinearities and a class of initial conditions living on non - resonant tori , the fpu system behaves like an integrable system and is represented by deformed tori in phase space . with increasing strength of the non - linearities",
    ", a progressive chaotic behavior appears , which would ultimately lead to the expected approach to equilibrium and equipartition @xcite .    even though there are regular regions in phase space , the existing estimates based on the kam theorem are qualitatively different from what we found , indicating that the physics of the fpu model is quite different from what is contained in these estimates .",
    "this makes us believe , on the basis of our numerical simulations , that it are the very special initial conditions chosen by fermi and collaborators that make their system belong to a regular region of phase space .",
    "if they had chosen an initial excitation ten times larger they could have observed equipartition .",
    "this takes place via a disappearence with increasing initial amplitude of a threshold , whose @xmath4-dependence is entirely different from that estimated in the kam theory framework .",
    "hence the source of fpu s failure is the fortuitous choice of initial conditions in a regular region of phase space , below this critical energy .",
    "thanks to the power of modern computers , we have considerably extended the calculations performed in the past by various authors .",
    "we have been able to reconcile different , and sometimes contradictory , aspects of the fpu dynamics , finding that regular regions and a large `` chaotic sea '' can coexist in phase space .",
    "the lack of equipartition in the original fpu experiment is not representative of a global property of phase space : apparently regular , soliton - like structures , similar to those of zabusky and kruskal , have a very long , possibly infinite , life - time below a stochasticity threshold , whereas , above the same threshold , they have only a finite life - time .    by choosing more physically generic initial conditions , i.e random positions and momenta ,",
    "a threshold energy for the onset of chaos is detected , showing a rather strong tendency to vanish at increasing number of degrees of freedom .",
    "thus we have found strong evidence in support of the point of view that the so - called `` fpu - problem '' does not invalidate the ( generic ) approach to equilibrium and the validity of equilibrium statistical mechanics . on the other hand",
    "the existence of long living initial states far from equilibrium , may well have interesting , non trivial physical implications .",
    "we have considered a one dimensional lattice of unit mass particles interacting via nearest - neighbor forces with unit harmonic coupling constant , with fixed end - points ( @xmath10 ) and described by the hamiltonian @xmath11 \\label{hfpu}\\ ] ] which is known as the fpu @xmath0-model .",
    "we can think of ( [ hfpu ] ) as the first anharmonic approximation to physical interatomic potentials of the morse or lennard - jones type .",
    "the cubic term is obviously responsible for the energy exchange among the normal modes of the harmonic part of ( [ hfpu ] ) .",
    "the normal mode coordinates , obtained by a standard orthogonal transformation , read @xmath12 and diagonalize the harmonic part of ( [ hfpu ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian in these new coordinates becomes @xmath13 \\label{hamilt - nm}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the frequency of the @xmath15-th normal mode and @xmath16 are the conjugated momenta .",
    "the natural unit of time with the choice of the units of eq .",
    "( [ hfpu ] ) , is given by the inverse of the fastest frequency of the harmonic part of ( [ hfpu ] ) : @xmath17 .",
    "in what follows @xmath18 corresponds to @xmath19 of this fastest linear period .",
    "we have numerically integrated this model by means of a very efficient third order bilateral symplectic algorithm @xcite that ensures a faithful representation of a hamiltonian flow and , with the adopted values of the rather large time step ranging from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , keeps the total energy @xmath22 constant within an average fluctuation level of @xmath23 without drift . such a high precision in numerical integration makes the outcome of the very long runs that are reported in the following reliable .",
    "the coupling constant was @xmath24 . in order to give an idea of the computational effort that was necessary to obtain the results reported in this paper ,",
    "let us mention that the computation of the largest lyapunov exponents @xmath25 at low energy typically required integration times in the interval @xmath26 ",
    "@xmath27 natural units of time : the longest runs lasted about @xmath28 hours of cpu time on an @xmath29 computer ( about the same cpu time would be necessary on a cray y - mp computer ) .",
    "the cpu time amounted to about @xmath30 hours on the following computers : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 @xmath34 , @xmath33 @xmath35 , @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 .    for what concerns the initial conditions ,",
    "we begin by choosing single mode excitations as fermi and collaborators did in their original experiment , i.e. the initial displacements of the particles from their equilibrium positions are given by the fundamental mode : @xmath40 and the initial momenta @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "used @xmath7 , @xmath43 , and mode number @xmath44 .",
    "now the main question is : if we repeat the original experiment , do we have any chance to find equipartition or any clear tendency to it by using present day fast computers ?    to answer this question we can not blindly make the longest integration of the trajectories of the hamiltonian ( [ hfpu ] ) , that we can afford on a very fast computer : the absence of equipartition , even after a very long integration time , would not be by itself conclusive for the non existence of equipartition for this model . rather , one should make an estimate of the equipartition time at @xmath43 and @xmath7 , and determine the @xmath45-dependence of this time for larger values of @xmath45 : a large initial excitation amplitude makes the anharmonicity of the system larger , hence the mode - mode couplings stronger , so that a faster relaxation to equipartition can be expected .",
    "a possible method to numerically detect equipartition of energy makes use of the spectral entropy @xcite defined by @xmath46 where the weights @xmath47 are given by the fraction of the total harmonic energy @xmath48 in the @xmath15-th normal mode @xcite @xmath49 so that @xmath50 reaches its maximum value when equipartition is attained .",
    "this entropy can be normalized as follows @xmath51 hence @xmath52 detects a `` freezing '' of the initial condition and @xmath53 detects equipartition .    by following the time relaxation of @xmath54",
    "we have obtained some estimates of the equipartition time @xmath55 at values of the initial excitation amplitude @xmath45 ranging from @xmath56 to @xmath57 . note that @xmath45 can not be too large , since then the cubic part of the potential becomes repulsive and the phase space trajectories are `` runaway '' trajectories , nor can @xmath45 be too small , since then the relaxation times become too large to be determined by our computations .",
    "however , two major difficulties arise with the @xmath58-method : _ i ) _ contrary to previously investigated systems @xcite , the relaxation pattern of @xmath54 does not show clearly when equipartition sets in , so that the equipartition time is a fuzzy quantity , _ ii ) _ if we somehow _ define _ the equipartition time by , for example , measuring the time needed for @xmath54 to drop below a threshold value , say @xmath59 , we find that @xmath60 , ( @xmath61 is the energy density )",
    ". for the fpu case ( @xmath43 , @xmath62 ) , we will show ( see section [ trapping ] ) that the equipartition time is far too long a time for numerical tests , since it would amount to about a year s cpu time .",
    "we have been able to overcome these difficulties by focussing on the development of chaoticity in the time evolution of the system rather than on the attainment of equipartition .",
    "we have exploited the existence of an integrable model , the toda lattice , close to the fpu-@xmath0 model .",
    "the toda lattice hamiltonian reads , in the same units as used in eq.([hfpu ] ) : @xmath77 + 2\\alpha ( q_{k+1 } - q_k ) -1\\right\\ } \\right]~ ; \\label{htoda}\\ ] ] and the power series expansion of its potential coincides , up to third order , with the potential part of ( [ hfpu ] ) .",
    "as the toda lattice hamiltonian describes an integrable system , the numerical computation of the time behavior of the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath78 must reveal the non - chaotic property of its dynamics .",
    "in particular , one might wonder whether some information can be obtained by comparing @xmath79 with @xmath80 for the same initial conditions , i.e. @xmath81 , @xmath42 .",
    "this turns indeed out to be the case . in fig .",
    "1 we report , as an example , @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the case @xmath7 and @xmath82 for an initial condition with @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( [ c.i . ] ) . up until @xmath84",
    "these two functions are so close to each other that the two are virtually indistinguishable .",
    "then - suddenly - they separate at @xmath85 : @xmath80 continues its decay toward zero , whereas @xmath79 tends to converge to a non - vanishing value .",
    "this makes possible to define clearly what a trapping time in a regular region of phase space is ; moreover , its numerical determination is unambiguous , as it can be deduced by simply looking at fig .",
    "1 . we attribute this dramatic difference to the un - trapping of the fpu system from its regular region in phase space by escaping to the chaotic component of its phase space .",
    "the peculiar behavior of @xmath79 suggests therefore that non - integrable motions , originated by one - mode initial excitations , after a transient , possibly long , trapping in a regular region of phase space , enter its chaotic component .",
    "the chaotic component of phase space , by the poincar - fermi theorem @xcite , is connected , so that we may well expect that equipartition is eventually attained on a finite , albeit possibly very long , time scale .",
    "the precise nature of the trapping mechanism is unclear to us .",
    "one could either think that the trajectories stick close to a kam torus during the trapping time , or that - for example - they are geodesics of a bumpy manifold to which an @xmath4-torus has been differentiably glued by a tiny `` bridge '' ; in that case a geodesic - originating at any point of the @xmath4-torus - is locally stable until it finds a path to escape from the torus .",
    "another possible mechanism of trapping and escape is discussed in the discussion section under point @xmath86 , in the light of the data discussed in the sequel of the present section .    in conclusion , once we observe that a trajectory enters the chaotic component of phase space , we are allowed to think that equipartition will be eventually attained . in fig .",
    "2 the relaxation times to equipartition @xmath87 and the trapping times @xmath88 , evaluated for the fpu-@xmath0 model , are shown .",
    "the results refer to @xmath7 and initial conditions given by eq.([c.i . ] ) .",
    "the initial excitation amplitudes @xmath45 range from @xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "the equipartition times appear to be between one and two orders of magnitude larger than the trapping times .",
    "if we extrapolate @xcite the equipartition time to the case of fpu , we find @xmath89 ( as is indicated in fig . 2 by an asterisk ) .",
    "since we can consider the fpu @xmath0-model as a third order expansion of a lennard - jones potential around its minimum , we can tentatively extrapolate the equipartition times reported in fig . 2 to a macroscopic system in three dimensions .",
    "as an example , we can roughly estimate what the physical equipartition time could be for a _ classical _ xenon crystal at zero temperature and only one normal mode initially excited . at @xmath90 , @xmath91 proper times",
    "( see fig .",
    "2 ) corresponds to about @xmath92 , using as proper time , obtained with standard lennard - jones parameters for xenon , @xmath93 .",
    "we have evaluated the trapping times @xmath94 for the fpu-@xmath0 model at different values of both the energy density @xmath95 and of the number of degrees of freedom @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath4 was varied , we kept the wavelength of the initial excitation constant ( i.e. @xmath96 in eq.([c.i . ] ) is taken proportional to @xmath4 : @xmath44 at @xmath7 , @xmath97 at @xmath98 and @xmath99 at @xmath100 ) , and we excited only one mode at @xmath101 .",
    "the results are reported in fig .",
    "3 . with decreasing @xmath95 ,",
    "first @xmath102 tends to increase monotonically , then , abruptly , it displays an apparently divergent behavior .",
    "in fact , when reaching critical threshold values , a very small change in @xmath95 suddenly gives an extremely steep increase in @xmath102 .",
    "this very steep increase of @xmath102 with decreasing @xmath95 suggests at least a very narrow bottleneck in phase space , through which the system can only escape with great difficulty .",
    "we assume that this bottleneck is not an insurmountable barrier , and for that reason , as well as to conform with previous use , we will call it a _ threshold_. this is consistent with the results of fig .",
    "4 , where the largest lyapunov exponents are reported for the same cases as in fig .",
    "we have used a cut - off of the integration time at @xmath103 .",
    "after such a long time - when @xmath95 was smaller than the threshold value - no separation between @xmath104 and @xmath105 has been observed : the values of @xmath106 at @xmath103 ( endpoints of broken lines in fig .",
    "4 , marked by arrows ) are taken as upper bounds for the fpu - lyapunov exponents and @xmath103 is taken as a lower bound for the trapping time of the fpu - phase point ( endpoints of the broken lines in fig .",
    "3 , marked by arrows ) . both @xmath107 ( from here on , by @xmath25 we mean @xmath106 ) and @xmath94 strongly suggest the existence of an @xmath4-dependent threshold value of the energy ( density ) , above which the motion is chaotic and below which the trajectories appear to be trapped in a regular region of phase space [ _ stochasticity threshold _ ( st ) ] .",
    "the following approximate relationship between @xmath45 and @xmath95 holds : @xmath108 therefore the threshold amplitudes @xmath109 leading to chaos are : @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "the dotted line at @xmath113 corresponds to the initial excitation amplitude @xmath43 of fpu s original paper .",
    "we see that fermi and coworkers chose an initial condition well below this st @xcite .",
    "figure 3 shows that if they had taken ten times larger amplitude , they would have observed equipartition during the integration time they used .",
    "this appears to us to be the explanation of the lack of statistical mechanical behavior observed in the original fpu numerical experiment .    a few more comments on these results : _",
    "i ) _ fig .",
    "3 suggests that with increasing @xmath4 , @xmath94 probably becomes less dependent on @xmath4 [ in fact the values of @xmath114 are closer to those of @xmath115 than to those of @xmath116 ; _ ii ) _ there is a narrow energy density interval where @xmath102 and @xmath25 oscillate , suggesting the transition in phase space from chaotic behavior at large @xmath95 to regular behavior at small @xmath95 ; _ iii ) _ the st shows a weak but clear dependence on @xmath4 ( provided the wavelength of the initial excitation is kept constant ) .",
    "this is not surprising because if we combine two identical systems - each with the same initial excitation - the composite system will have new low frequency modes that are absent in the separate subsystems , which can be expected to facilitate the mechanism of energy exchange among the normal modes .",
    "as far as we are aware , the _ direct _ evidence given in fig . 4 of the existence of a st at @xmath117 , obtained through the behavior of the largest lyapounov exponent , was never found before in nonlinear hamiltonian systems .",
    "an _ indirect _ suggestion of its existence ( through a `` freezing '' of the decay of the spectral entropy ) has been given in @xcite for the fpu @xmath6-model .",
    "a question now arises : does such a threshold refer to a global property of the constant energy surface @xmath118 or is it , rather , a local property of @xmath118 sensitive to the initial condition ?    in order to answer this question we have considered also the following initial conditions at @xmath7 : _ i ) _ @xmath119 [ the fundamental mode - eq .",
    "( [ c.i . ] ) - is excited with amplitudes ranging from @xmath120 to @xmath121 ] and @xmath122 ( @xmath42 ) are gaussian random numbers with zero mean and standard deviation ( `` temperature '' ) equal to @xmath123 ; _ ii ) _",
    "@xmath124 , @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) and @xmath127 ( @xmath42 ) are randomly chosen according to a gaussian distribution .    in the first case ,",
    "a fraction of the energy in the initial excitation is given to all the normal modes of the system : in so doing , we are displacing the starting point on @xmath118 , proportional to the magnitude of the standard deviation of the noisy component of the initial excitation .",
    "this is intended to provide some information about the extension of the regular region(s ) in phase space .",
    "if all , or almost all , the energy of the initial excitation is concentrated in one or a few modes , then we are dealing with a non - equilibrium initial condition ; the existence of a st entails then that a system , prepared in a non - equilibrium state below such a threshold , will appear never to attain equipartition of the energy of the initial excitation .",
    "the noisy component has a self evident physical meaning related to the impossibility of preparing any physical system in a perfectly ordered initial state : at non - zero temperature some randomness in the initial conditions is unavoidable .    the second choice - completely random initial conditions - mimicks a physical situation that corresponds to a crystal prepared at an assigned temperature ( i.e. mean kinetic energy per degree of freedom ) at thermal equilibrium .    in fig .",
    "5 the effect of changing the initial conditions according to the above prescriptions is shown .",
    "here @xmath7 , the squares refer to @xmath119 and no random component , the asterisks refer to only random initial excitations and the star - like squares refer to @xmath119 plus a random component .",
    "in each case a threshold energy ( or equivalently energy density , since @xmath4 is fixed ) is found . at @xmath128 ,",
    "the uncertainties in the determination of @xmath25 are of the order of the size of the symbols used ; at @xmath129 , an estimate is difficult because of unpredictable fluctuations of @xmath78 that could be reduced only by prohibitively long integration times . nevertheless , the information given by fig .",
    "5 is unambiguous . down",
    "to @xmath130 all the values of @xmath131 , obtained with different initial conditions , crowd along the same line ; below @xmath132 the values of @xmath25 , obtained with different initial conditions , separate and exibit a coexistence of regular and chaotic regions on the constant energy surface in phase space , whose details depend on the initial conditions .",
    "below @xmath133 , even with only random initial conditions , the motions are regular ( star - like squares ) .",
    "this tells us that the phase space undergoes some important structural change as a function of the energy , in analogy with what is observed in two - degrees - of - freedom systems , like the hnon - heiles model @xcite , where fully developed chaos , a coexistence of regular and chaotic regions of phase space , or only regular trajectories are observed , depending on the value of the energy .",
    "an important question is the stability or instability of the stochasticity threshold with @xmath4 . to this end",
    "we have numerically determined @xmath107 at @xmath134 always choosing random initial conditions , i.e. @xmath135 , @xmath42 , with @xmath136 gauss - distributed random numbers with zero mean and variance @xmath137 ( after the assignement of the random values @xmath136 , the momenta are adjusted , by rescaling them , in order to obtain a fixed initial @xmath95 ) .    in fig .",
    "6 the outcome of these computations is reported .",
    "the endpoints of the broken lines have the same meaning as already discussed above . at large @xmath95",
    "there is a tendency of all the sets of points to join .",
    "this fact is most evident for @xmath7 and @xmath98 which have a line segment in common and then separate at small @xmath95 : the larger @xmath4 , the smaller the @xmath95 at which the separation occurs .    at each @xmath4",
    ", we take as rough estimate of the stochasticity threshold @xmath138 , the value of @xmath95 at the midpoint between the two lowest points on each curve , because the lowest point ( marked by an arrow ) is presumably below threshold .",
    "figure 7 then shows that for these threshold values @xmath138 plotted _ vs. _ @xmath4 holds : @xmath5 .",
    "this result is interesting for the following reasons :     i ) the threshold values vanish sufficiently fast with increasing @xmath4 , that the existence of regular regions of phase space below @xmath138 does not constitute a problem for _ equilibrium _ statistical mechanics .",
    "in fact , it appears that @xmath139 is not too small to obtain indications , if not `` confirmation '' , of the statistical mechanical behavior of the fpu-@xmath0 system .",
    "ii ) both the values of @xmath138 and the @xmath4-dependence @xmath5 can hardly be explained on the basis of the best available estimate of the perturbation amplitudes for which a positive measure of the regular kam regions in phase space exists : @xmath140 @xcite , where @xmath141 measures the relative strength of the anharmonic to the harmonic part of a given hamiltonian ( @xmath141 depends on @xmath95 ) , @xmath142 is a threshold value , @xmath143 and @xmath144 are constants .",
    "there are also power - law estimates for @xmath145 , i.e. @xmath146 , obtained in the context of kam theory @xcite , however - at present - @xmath147 is still very large : @xmath148 .",
    "\\iii ) the bounds on the threshold value @xmath149 found by enz _ et al . _",
    "for the fpu-@xmath0 model @xcite predict an @xmath4-dependence which is in much better agreement with our results than the exponential drop with @xmath4 mentioned in the previous point .",
    "we conclude with the following remarks .",
    "\\1 . it is worth mentioning that recently the existence of an equipartition threshold vanishing at increasing @xmath4 has also been reported for the fpu-@xmath6 model @xcite .",
    "it is inappropriate to compare these results _ quantitatively _ with ours : our model is different and the evidence for a stochasticity threshold for the fpu @xmath6-model has been obtained indirectly , through the opening of a local trap in phase space , which prevented equipartition . however , we can say that both results are in _ qualitative _ agreement : threshold effects , either concerning transient dynamics to equipartition of non - equilibrium initial conditions ( studied through spectral entropy ) or concerning the dynamics of equilibrium initial conditions [ studied through @xmath107 ] , vanish at increasing @xmath4 .",
    "\\2 . in this paper",
    "we report the existence of two interesting phenomena among others : the apparent existence of regular regions in the phase space of a non - integrable hamiltonian system as is the fpu-@xmath0 model and the existence of almost regular regions of phase space where the trajectories are trapped during long but finite times .",
    "these phenomena are reminiscent of the kam and nekhoroshev @xcite theorems respectively .",
    "we have already discussed throughout the paper why our results disagree with the present - day quantitative predictions of the kam theorem .",
    "similarly , the nekhoroshev theorem does not seem to be able to provide an explanation of the observed phenomenology as well .",
    "in fact , without entering into the details of how a thorough comparison with our results could be made , nekhoroshev s estimate of the lower bound of the `` trapping '' time @xmath152 of a trajectory close to its initial condition is @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is a constant , @xmath141 has the same meaning as above , and @xmath155 is the optimal @xmath4-dependence @xcite of the exponent . hence for @xmath156 , as is the case of the results of fig . 3 for @xmath94 ,",
    "the `` nekhoroshev trapping '' time @xmath152 is @xmath157 independently of @xmath141 ( thus of @xmath95 ) .",
    "therefore , it appears that the physical mechanisms responsible for finite time trapping in phase space , that are behind the nekhoroshev theorem and our numeric phenomenology , respectively , are different .",
    "thus we emphasize the difference between , on the one hand , the approach to infinite time trapping ( kam theorem ) and to finite time trapping ( nekhoroshev theorem ) based on the description of the persistence of certain local properties of regular regions of phase space , and , on the other hand , our chaos - related approach , based on the comparison of @xmath78 for the fpu and toda lattices ( fig .",
    "the behavior of @xmath78 suggests that the sudden escape from the regular region occurs as if the trajectory would eventually find a `` hole '' in its boundary .",
    "it is not out of place to note that while the st drops to zero as @xmath158 in the fpu @xmath0-model , there is another transition phenomenon that does not suffer this @xmath4-dependence : it is the strong stochasticity threshold ( sst ) that concerns a transition from weak to strong chaos @xcite which has been discovered in the fpu @xmath6-model and in the lattice @xmath159 model .",
    "unfortunately , this sst can not be investigated in the fpu-@xmath0 model because the cubic potential prevents working at too large energy .",
    "we note , however , that the stability with @xmath4 of the sst makes the sst not only a dynamical phenomenon related to dynamical chaos , but also of potential interest to statistical mechanical phenomena .",
    "the existence of special initial conditions that create non - trivial dynamical behavior , though irrelevant for _ equilibrium _ statistical mechanics because of their negligible measure , could be physically relevant for transient _ non - equilibrium _ statistical mechanics if we can conceive an operational method to prepare a real system in such a special initial state ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "let us comment about the classical explanation of the non - statistical mechanical behavior of the fpu model proposed by zabusky _",
    "@xcite , based on the existence of soliton solutions of the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation , derived as a special continuum limit of the fpu @xmath0-model .",
    "their experiments were carried out over much shorter time scales than those that are possible nowadays . as we have seen above , thanks to very long numerical integrations , it turns out that , below a threshold , regular regions of phase space can coexist with chaotic ones .",
    "in the light of our results , we can thus assert that the kdv soliton solutions belong to the regular region of phase space of the fpu system from which - after sufficiently long time - escape will occur to the chaotic component of phase space .    in fig .",
    "8 the patterns of the displacements @xmath160 as a function of position @xmath161 are shown at different times in the case @xmath7 , @xmath83 . for times @xmath162 below the trapping time @xmath163 , they are looking as regular structures , apparently composed of a superposition of a small number of waves , which display a trapping and a soliton - like recurrence ( see fig .",
    "8b ) , similar to that observed by zabusky and kruskal @xcite and tuck and menzel @xcite , although we have fixed boundary conditions , as in fpu s original paper , rather than periodic boundary conditions as considered by zabusky and kruskal .",
    "for @xmath164 we observed a gradual untrapping or decay of these regular features due to more and more complicated structures consisting of a superposition of an increasing number of different waves ( radiated by the decaying solitons @xcite ) .",
    "finally , for @xmath165 , an almost noisy pattern is attained ( see fig .",
    "8c ) as well as energy equipartition ( detected through the spectral entropy ) .",
    "this demonstrates clearly the compatibility of the existence of trapping , i.e. very long lived regular solutions , and the attainment of equipartition , albeit after possibly very long times .",
    "it is still an open question whether , at fixed @xmath4 , below the stochasticity threshold , i.e. at energy density such that the largest lyapunov exponent seems to vanish for any initial condition , the lifetime of regular solutions might actually diverge .",
    "however , we have found that this threshold energy density drops to zero as @xmath166 .",
    "therefore it appears to us that at sufficiently large @xmath4 the existence of kdv solitons does not hinder a good statistical mechanical behavior of the fpu system .",
