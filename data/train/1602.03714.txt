    "cherenkov radiation is a well - understood phenomenon related to the passage of charged , ultra relativistic particles through a dielectric medium . since its discovery by p. a. cherenkov in 1934  @xcite , it has been studied both experimentally and theoretically with such success that cherenkov radiation is now routinely used in applications such as cherenkov particle counters ; study of biomolecules and in astronomical observatories .",
    "one particularly interesting application is to search for energetic neutrinos from cosmic sources .",
    "because of their low flux and small interaction cross - sections , this requires very large detectors , with volume of order 1 km@xmath0 . to build a detector with volume of order 1 km@xmath0 requires naturally occuring water or ice as the cherenkov medium .",
    "currently , the largest detector is icecube @xcite , located at the south pole .",
    "it observes the cherenkov radiation from the charged particles produced in neutrino - induced showers . to understand this radiation , it is necessary to understand how charged particles radiate photons in the antarctic ice .",
    "this ice consists of hexagonal ice crystals that are oriented in the same direction@xcite .",
    "this orientation leads to an anisotropy , and the cherenkov radiation may depend on the direction of the ice orientation .",
    "this is of particular interest because icecube has already observed an anistropy in the ice , believed to be due to the scattering depending on the azimuthal direction the photon follows through the medium @xcite .",
    "any cherenkov production anisotropies may be confused with this scattering anisotropy and the presence of a directional cherenkov anisotropy can also affect neutrino directional and energy reconstructions .",
    "this is particularly important for the next - generation pingu detector , which will need to reach very low levels of systematic error to be able to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy @xcite .",
    "the first theory for cherenkov radiation in an isotropic medium was produced by i. y tamm and i. m frank in 1937  @xcite . since then a number of flawed attempts have been made to describe the same process in an anisotropic medium where the particle propagation direction becomes important for the cherenkov emission . in 1956 , v. e. pafomov did a calculation  @xcite that reproduced the correct emission angles and described the intensity distribution , but failed to give the correct result when the calculation was applied to an isotropic material . then in 1960 , c. muzicar  @xcite obtained a similar result for the emission angles but a different dependence of the number of photons emitted on the propagation direction of the emitting particle with respect to the symmetry axis of the medium .",
    "an experiment carried out by d. gfller @xcite in the following year was in support of pafomovs result .",
    "the first fully convincing calculation for the cherenkov photon emission from an anisotropic material was given in a 1997 paper  @xcite by a. delbart , j. derr and r. chipaux ; despite the succesful calculation , however , the paper includes a number of typing errors in the central equations for the cherenkov photon yield .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a corrected version of the description of the cherenkov radiation in a uniaxial medium as published by delbart et",
    ". _ al_. we then proceed to calculate some energy spectra and discuss the possible implications for icecube and whether this should be implemented in the in - ice propagation codes .",
    "lastly , we prescribe a procedure to test the present calculations in a small - scale experiment , and results relevant for high - energy calorimetry .",

    "the particle emits cherenkov radiation if the condition @xmath3 is fulfilled ; that is , only for relativistic particle speeds ; throughout this paper , we take as input a relativistic charged particle with @xmath4 .",
    "the radiation is emitted at a characteristic angle , @xmath5 , with respect to the propagation direction of the emitting particle .",
    "contrary to other relativistic radiation phenomena like synchrotron radiation and bremsstrahlung , this angle can be quite large : @xmath6 for ice , and @xmath7 for the birefringent material rutile ; both of which will be discussed later .",
    "the emission angle is azimuthally symmetric in isotropic materials .",
    "if the material is anisotropic this symmetry may be broken , and the refractive index may depend on the angle of the incoming particle , complicating the radiation pattern .    here , we study uniaxial materials where the optical axis defines a direction around which there is azimuthal symmetry .",
    "these materials have two different refractive indices .",
    "light polarized along the optical axis experiences a refractive index , @xmath8 with @xmath9 for extraordinary ; and light with a polarization perpendicular to the optical axis experiences a refractive index @xmath10 , with @xmath11 for ordinary .",
    "these terms originate from optics theory and are applied to cherenkov radiation only for anisotropic media .",
    "the ordinary wave denotes photons travelling along the optical axis .",
    "their propagation does not depend on the photon polarization .",
    "in contrast , the propagation properties of the extraordinary wave depend on their polarization .",
    "photons travelling at other angles experience a refractive index in between @xmath10 and @xmath8 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath12 which is a unit - vector in the direction of the displacement and @xmath13 which points in the direction of the electric field is @xmath14 . this will be used along with the expression for the phase velocity , @xmath15 . combining these equations and using",

    "for the ordinary photons the phase velocity is @xmath46 and therefore @xmath47 which is the cherenkov emission angle in an isotropic medium .",
    "it is a general result that if the particle propagates along the optical axis , @xmath48 , no ordinary photons are emitted .",
    "the calculation of the triply differential cross section of the number of emitted extraordinary photons follows a similar route as that for the ordinary photons .",
    "it is somewhat more complicated because now @xmath49 .",
    "however , @xmath26 is still a symmetry axis for the emission along @xmath30 although it turns out that the extraordinary cone has an elliptical shape .",
    "again , the first step is to evaluate the argument of the dirac delta function which is @xmath50 for the extraordinary wave . from the definition of the phase velocity , we get for the extraordinary wave @xmath51 using this to solve the dirac delta function to obtain the geometrical properties of the wave one finds that the choice @xmath52 with @xmath53 simplifies the expression ( [ eq : ginzburg ] ) the most . in appendix",
    "a , we show the two final steps needed to evaluate this expression for the extraordinary waves and discuss some errors presented in the results given in @xcite .",
    "the number of extraordinary photons emitted is @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "in the previous sections we listed the corrected results for the number of ordinary and extraordinary photons differential in emission angle , energy and target thickness . when these contributions are integrated over angle and energy and subsequently added , we obtain the total number of photons emitted per pathlength @xmath32 . for the case",
    "when @xmath58 and @xmath59 we get respectively :    @xmath60    when calculated in units of ev@xmath61 and mm@xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "later we will calculate the relative number @xmath63 , to compare the two most extreme scenarios .",
    "we will also assume that the refractive indices @xmath64 and @xmath8 are constant .",
    "the overall change of the refractive index of ice from the top to the bottom of icecube due to pressure and temperature variations was estimated  @xcite to be @xmath65 .",
    "@xcite gives a review of the dependence of the refractive index on the photon wavelength .",
    "we have seen in the theory section that the birefringence of crystals affects the emission of cherenkov radiation .",
    "this will be relevant for icecube if all or most of the crystals in which radiation is emitted point in the same direction .",

    "the circular plots are called lpo s for lattice - preferred orientation which shows the crystallographic orientations of the crystallites composing the sample , in stereographic projection ; see @xcite for a textbook definition .",
    "they show the degree to which the individual crystals in the ice point in the same direction . at all five drilling locations",
    ", the ice is randomly oriented near the surface and more and more aligned deeper down , except when just next to the bedrock . in all five samples , at the depths of the icecube optical sensors _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath66 m , the ice crystals are not randomly oriented but rather have a high degree of common orientation . generally , the optical axis tends to rotate towards an axis of compression . at large depths",
    "the ice crystals are no longer randomly oriented as at the surface , but have a preferred direction which depends on the flow history @xcite .",
    "no such measurement has been performed at the geographic south pole where icecube is located , and the icecube dust logger @xcite is insensitive to any azimuthal dependence of the ice properties . however , the icecube optical modules are equipped with led flashers which can send signals to other icecube optical modules . using this system ,",
    "the icecube collaboration has observed a significant anisotropy in the scattering of light at the detector site  @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy is oriented along the direction of ice flow .",
    "it is typically attributed to dust grains in the ice which should be aligned by the pressure gradient in the ice @xcite , but may have other origins such as the effect discussed here .",
    "we now apply the results presented in the theory section to antarctic ice , with a focus on the extreme cases with @xmath58 and @xmath67 .",

    "for the case @xmath58 , no ordinary photons are emitted and the solid red line only stems from the contribution of extraordinary photons .",
    "the difference between the solid blue and red curves is the net difference in cherenkov radiation yield depending on the particle propagation direction to the optical axis .",
    "the lower plot on figure [ fig : hexagonalice ] shows how the cherenkov emission angle @xmath42 depends on the azimuthal angle @xmath68 .",
    "when @xmath76 , the ordinary photons are emitted at a constant angle @xmath77 , while the emission angle of extraordinary photons varies by @xmath78 depending on the @xmath68 angle ; with peaks located at @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",

    ", the index of refraction is increasing with decreasing wavelength .",
    "for the available data points , we have recalculated the ratio @xmath85 as a function of wavelength , see figure [ fig : wavelength ] .",
    "the top figure shows for increasing wavelengths both the ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices decrease .",
    "the bottom figure shows that the ratio @xmath85 is relatively stable between wavelengths from about @xmath83 up to about @xmath86 nm .",
    "the single datapoint at a wavelength of @xmath84 nm gives an @xmath85 value which is three to four times larger ; this is also where the difference between @xmath10 and @xmath8 is largest according to the top figure .",

    "the effect of anisotropic cherenkov emission on neutrino detection depends on the observation channel .",
    "for the most energetic event yet seen by icecube , with an observed energy of 2.6 pev , the collaboration reported a preliminary angular uncertainty of 0.26 degrees @xcite , comparable to these variations .",
    "however , this was a muon track ; the excellent angular resolution came from the 1 km long lever arm , and it is unlikely that small variations in emission would affect this reconstruction .",
    "this also holds for less energetic muons .    in icecube , @xmath87",
    "are observed through their electromagnetic showers , where the direction is determined by observing the effects of the cherenkov cone .",
    "however , in icecube most photons scatter before they are detected , so the cherenkov cone is largely washed out , and the angular uncertainty for these events is at least 10 to 15 degrees , increasing at lower energies @xcite .",
    "it seems unlikely that the variation in cherenkov angle will have an effect on current resolution ; especially considering that uncertainties due to light propagation in the ice are more significant with an effect of order 10 % in icecube .",
    "however , it could be important with smaller detectors with less scattering ( _ e .",
    "pingu ) , and improved reconstruction algorithms with better angular resolution .",
    "the amplitude variation of 0.3% is smaller than the energy uncertainty of 15 % for icecube ( above 10 tev ) , so does not seem to be significant  @xcite .",
    "a few other experiments use the antarctic ice as a cherenkov medium . the askaryan radio array ( ara )",
    "@xcite and the antarctic ross ice - shelf antenna neutrino array ( arianna )  @xcite are proposed experiments to study extremely rare cosmic neutrinos with energy above @xmath88 ev .",
    "both designs take advantage of the askaryan effect  @xcite : the interaction of a cosmic neutrino with a nucleus near the detector causes an extended particle shower with a net negative charge due to annihilation of shower positrons with electrons in the medium through which the shower propagates .",
    "the propagation of this net charge leads to the emission of radiowaves - the askaryan effect .",
    "ara will consist of an array of multiple measuring stations distributed over roughly @xmath89 m@xmath90 ; @xmath91 test stations are already in place , taking data .",
    "arianna is a proposed array of multiple measurement stations distributed over roughly @xmath92 km@xmath90 on the ross ice shelf in antarctica ; 7 test stations are already taking data  @xcite .",
    "arianna is located on a floating ice - shelf with a thickness of @xmath93 m and it aims at performing both direct and indirect measurements of high energy cosmic neutrinos ; in indirect measurements , the radio waves reflect off the ice - water interface before reaching the detectors .",
    "the ice sheet at the arianna site was largely formed on the antarctic plateau and gradually pushed north over a time scale of 100,000 years , going through gaps in the trans - antarctic mountains onto the ross sea .",
    "anisotropies may have formed before , during and/or after the course of this transport .",
    "these experiments need to understand how radio waves propagate through antarctic ice .",
    "fortunately , partly because radar is used to survey antarctic ice and the underlying rock , a fair amount is known about the ice .",
    "the refractive indices depend on depth . below the firn @xmath94 at @xmath95 ghz @xcite ,",
    "similar to the value obtained at @xmath96 ghz  @xcite .",
    "the results reported on the two refractive indices compare well with the standard value @xmath97  @xcite at radio frequencies referred to in arianna papers .",
    "ice crystal orientations are believed to play a significant role , and birefringence due to oriented ice crystals is significant .",
    "@xcite show that the scattering of radiowaves in antarctic ice depends on the angle between the radio polarization and the direction of ice flow .",
    "so , possible anisotropy in cherenkov radiation must be considered .",
    "greenland also has glaciers which could host a high - energy neutrino detector ; this would provide northern hemisphere coverage .",
    "one group has measured radio propagation near the summit station in greenland  @xcite .",
    "they find radio attenuation properties that are , after accounting for the warmer temperatures , similar to those measured at the south pole .",
    "likewise , studies of ice crystal orientation seem to be similar . a plot similar to the present figure [ fig : antarcticice ] , but for greenland , is available in  @xcite .",
    "radio waves do not scatter significantly in the ice , so radio - detection experiments directly observe the cherenkov cone ; in fact measurements of the radio spectrum is used for directional reconstruction , by determining how far off the cherenkov cone the observer is .",
    "so , any alteration of the cherenkov cone is more important for radio - detection than for optical experiments ; the change in cherenkov angle translates fairly directly into angular uncertainty and hence the leads to a change in apparent neutrino direction .",
    "the fractional changes in index of refraction between the two extreme directions are somewhat larger than at optical frequencies , at least at atmospheric pressure ; the pressure dependence of this difference has not been studied . in the top @xmath98 m , the refractive index of the antarctic ice changes from @xmath99 to @xmath100 i.e. by @xmath101 for radio waves @xcite .",

    "<S> we revisit the theory of cherenkov radiation in uniaxial crystals . </S>",
    "<S> historically , a number of flawed attempts have been made at explaining this radiation phenomenon and a consistent error - free description is nowhere available . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our calculation to a large modern day telescope - icecube . </S>",
    "<S> being located at the antarctica , this detector makes use of the naturally occuring ice as a medium to generate cherenkov radiation . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the high pressure at the depth of the detector site , large volumes of hexagonal ice crystals are formed . we calculate how this affects the cherenkov radiation yield and angular dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the effect is small , at most about a percent , and would only be relevant in future high precision instruments like e.g. precision icecube next generation upgrade ( pingu ) . for radio - cherenkov experiments which use the presence of a clear cherenkov cone to determine the arrival direction , </S>",
    "<S> any variation in emission angle will directly and linearly translate into a change in apparent neutrino direction . in closing </S>",
    "<S> , we also describe a simple experiment to test this formalism , and calculate the impact of anisotropy on light - yields from lead tungstate crystals as used , for example , in the cms calorimeter at the cern lhc . </S>"
