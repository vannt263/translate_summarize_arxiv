    "the physics at the nanoscale has emerged as one of the most active areas in condensed matter physics .",
    "this new field includes the study of small metallic and superconducting islands , quantum dots and nanostructurated semiconductors , nanotubes and quantum corrals , nanoelectronics and nano - characterization among other things.@xcite    the advances in nanotechnologies revived the interest in the kondo effect,@xcite one of the paradigms of strongly correlated systems .",
    "on one hand , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) allowed the direct measurement of local spectroscopic properties of kondo impurities on noble metal surfaces@xcite and in nanoscopic systems.@xcite on the other hand , it has been shown that single electron transistors and single walled carbon nanotubes weakly coupled to contacts may behave as kondo impurities generating new alternatives to study the phenomena.@xcite    in its simplest form , the kondo problem is a single quantum spin interacting with an ideal electron gas .",
    "an antiferromagnetic coupling between the impurity and the free electron spins gives rise to an anomalous scattering at the fermi energy leading to a large impurity contribution to the resistivity .",
    "simultaneously the impurity spin is screened by the conduction electrons and the magnetic susceptibility saturates at low temperature .",
    "there is a characteristic temperature @xmath2 that separates the low temperature from the high temperature regimes . at @xmath3 ,",
    "the impurity spin is essentially free and the problem can be treated by perturbations in a dimensionless coupling constant @xmath4 . at @xmath5 the impurity spin",
    "is screened forming a singlet complex with the conduction electrons and the system is described by an infinite effective coupling . the crossover regime with @xmath6 is more difficult to describe and the best treatment corresponds to the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) as done by wilson.@xcite    the characteristic kondo temperature is given by @xmath2 @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the free electron bandwidth . associated to this energy scale there is a characteristic length scale known as the kondo screening length @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the fermi velocity .",
    "the physical meaning of the screening length is that , in the low temperature regime where the impurity spin is screened , the antiferromagnetic correlations between the impurity and conduction electron spins extend up to a distance of the order of @xmath12 .",
    "the problem of kondo impurities in nanoscopic systems for different experimental realizations has been the subject of many recent theoretical and experimental works.@xcite when a kondo system , either an atomic impurity or an artificial atom like a quantum dot ( qd ) , is embedded in a small system of volume @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the spacial dimension , the length - scale @xmath15 should be compared with the characteristic kondo length @xmath12 . for @xmath16 finite - size effects",
    "are expected to be important .",
    "the condition @xmath17 is equivalent to @xmath18 where the energy @xmath19 gives the average level spacing of the finite system . for a finite system the characteristic energy @xmath19 acts as a low energy cutoff for the charge and spin excitations and",
    "consequently it modifies the low temperature behavior of the system .",
    "the ground state properties of a kondo impurity in a small system have been addressed by a number of authors using different approximations.@xcite the thermodynamic properties and the effect of coupling the system to a macroscopic reservoir have recently been studied using the wilson s renormalization group.@xcite in this work we extend renormalization group calculations to evaluate the impurity spectral density and analyze how the new energy or length scales introduced by the finite size affects the kondo resonance at the fermi energy .",
    "we also study the temperature dependence of the low energy spectral density .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present the model and describe how the numerical renormalization group is adapted to our case .",
    "we then recap the most relevant thermodynamic properties .",
    "section iii contains the spectral properties of the impurity for frequencies close to the fermi energy . after presenting the general formulation",
    "we show results for finite systems , systems in contact with a reservoir and the temperature dependence of the kondo resonances .",
    "finally section iv includes a summary and discussion .",
    "in this section we present the model for an impurity in a nanoscopic system coupled with a macroscopic reservoir and briefly discuss how wilson s renormalization group is adapted to this problem .",
    "then we review the thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "our starting point is the anderson model for magnetic impurities with a hamiltonian which in the usual notation reads:@xcite    @xmath20    where the operator @xmath21 creates an electron with spin @xmath22 at the impurity orbital with energy @xmath23 and coulomb repulsion @xmath24 , and @xmath25 creates an electron in an extended state with quantum numbers @xmath26 and @xmath27 and energy @xmath28 .",
    "the last term represents the effect of an external magnetic field along the @xmath29-direction coupled to the impurity spin @xmath30 .",
    "hereafter we will use @xmath31 as our unit of energy .    in this notation ,",
    "the nanostructure of the system is hidden in the structure of the one - electron extended states with energies @xmath32 and wavefunctions @xmath33 . in equation ( [ ham ] ) the hybridization matrix elements are taken proportional to the extended state wavefunctions at the impurity position , i.e. @xmath34 where the impurity position is defined as the origin of coordinates .",
    "we consider a simple structure consisting of a spherical metallic cluster of radius @xmath35 with the impurity at the center . the cluster is embedded in a bulk material with which it is weakly coupled through a large surface barrier .",
    "the hamiltonian can be put in the form @xmath36 where the first term is the anderson model hamiltonian for an impurity in an infinite homogeneous host and the last term is a spherically symmetric potential barrier placed at a distance @xmath37 from the impurity .",
    "figure [ fig1](a ) illustrates the configuration described by the model . for an infinite impenetrable barrier ,",
    "the central cluster is decoupled from the macroscopic reservoir and the model describes an impurity in a small sample .",
    "in this situation , the extended states that are coupled to the impurity , are confined in the central cluster and their energy spectrum is a discrete spectrum with a mean energy level separation given by the characteristic energy @xmath38 for a finite barrier these states are hybridized with the continuum acquiring a finite lifetime , the local density of states inside the central cluster then presents resonances separated by the energy @xmath19 and with widths @xmath39 that are determined by the barrier .",
    "the model then incorporates the new energy scales @xmath40 and @xmath41 , that may drastically change the impurity behavior .",
    "is shown together with the impurity levels at @xmath23 and @xmath42 . in",
    "( b ) the linear chain obtained after wilson s canonical transformation.,width=283 ]    this geometrical structure is particularly appropriate to use the numerical renormalization group approach developed by wilson .",
    "wilson introduced a logarithmic discretization of the energy of the conduction electrons , dividing the band in a series of energy intervals with exponentially decreasing width . by means of a canonical transformation",
    "the resulting hamiltonian can be mapped into a linear chain with variable hoppings .",
    "each site representing an orbital surrounding the impurity with an associated energy ( or length ) scale .",
    "wilson proposed to solve the linear chain by iterative perturbation .",
    "a truncated chain with @xmath43 sites , described by an effective hamiltonian @xmath44 , gives the correct physics on an energy scale @xmath45 .",
    "a renormalization group transformation corresponds to adding a site to the chain and relates the hamiltonians describing successive lower energy scales .",
    "this leads to a systematic way of calculating the thermodynamic properties at successive lower temperatures and the spectroscopic properties at successive lower frequencies .    in our case ,",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath46 is rewritten in wilson s basis as schematically shown in fig.[fig1](b ) .",
    "the potential barrier is described including a higher diagonal energy to the orbital centered around @xmath35 . due to the structure of",
    "wilson s basis wavefunctions , a given potential barrier leads to a diagonal energy that decreases as @xmath35 increases .",
    "alternatively the barrier can be simulated with a smaller hopping matrix element in the region where @xmath47 is different from zero .",
    "we adopted this last description reducing one hopping term by a factor @xmath48 . in what follows",
    "it is assumed that the band of extended states is half filled - the fermi energy is set equal to zero - and @xmath49 .",
    "this guarantees that the electron - hole symmetry of the problem is preserved .",
    "the properties of a kondo impurity depend on the local density of states at the impurity coordinate that in wilson s representation is the local density of states at site 1 .",
    "we end this section with a brief discussion on the effect of the confining potential @xmath47 on the local density of states close to the fermi energy . for a given @xmath43",
    "the spectrum of @xmath44 depends on the parity of @xmath43 . in the absence of impurity , a one particle state at zero",
    "energy exists only for odd @xmath43 as schematically shown in fig .",
    "the spectrum , as a function of @xmath43 , alternates between those of figs . [",
    "fig2](a ) and [ fig2](b ) . the mean energy separation , between the one - electron states , is given by the characteristic energy @xmath19 that decreases as @xmath43 increases .",
    "this is the spectrum of a finite system ( @xmath50 ) described by an infinite barrier .",
    "the other one electron states , not shown in fig . [ fig2 ] , are not at energies @xmath51 or @xmath52 with integer @xmath53 .",
    "this is due to the logarithmic discretization of the band . how the nrg can be used to analyze finite size effects",
    "was shown by nozieres@xcite . to show that the logarithmic discretization correctly describes the low energy spectrum of a impurity in finite systems , in the next section , we compare the exacts results on a finite system with those obtained with the nrg .",
    "the alternating spectrum with a fixed fermi energy corresponds to an alternating parity in the number of electrons , in fact for a fixed electron density , as the radius @xmath35 of the cluster increases , the number of electrons alternates between even and odd .",
    "we recall that due to the symmetry of the system only the sector of the hilbert space with s - wave electrons is considered here .",
    "( vertical bars ) and @xmath54 ( lines ) . in the later case",
    "the spectral density has been evaluated using a small imaginary part in the frequency ( a ) @xmath55 and ( b ) @xmath56.,width=264 ]    with a finite barrier ( @xmath57 ) the discrete states of the cluster are hybridized with the continuum of the host metal and become resonances .",
    "the local density of states then becomes a continuum but retains some structure characterized by the energy @xmath19 . in the nrg approach , hamiltonians @xmath44 with @xmath58 accumulate states at low energies representing the broadening of the central peak for odd @xmath59 or the tails of the states at @xmath60 for even @xmath59 .",

[ fig2](a ) and [ fig2](b ) as the fermi energy being at a resonance ( at - resonance ) or between two resonances ( off - resonance ) respectively .",
    "as we show below , this structure of the local density of states determines the thermodynamic and the spectral properties of the impurity .",
    "here we briefly recap the thermodynamic properties of the model .",
    "as stated above , for @xmath62 the at - resonance situation corresponds to an odd number of extended electrons .",
    "an impurity in the kondo limit contributes with an extra electron and the ground state is a singlet indicated as @xmath63 is zero reflecting the complete screening of the impurity spin and the zero temperature susceptibility is finite . for the off - resonance situation",
    "the ground state of the isolated cluster with a kondo impurity is a kramers spin-@xmath64 doublet , @xmath65 and @xmath66 where the summation is done over the low energy states @xmath67 with energies @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath70 have to be evaluated in a recursive way at each renormalization step .",
    "the susceptibility reflects the thermodynamic properties of the system and we use the effective magnetic moment @xmath71 as an indicator of the degree of screening of the impurity spin .    in absence of barrier - corresponding to the infinite homogeneous system -",
    "the characteristic energy scale is the kondo temperature indicated as @xmath72 .",
    "a finite barrier at @xmath35 - enclosing @xmath59 shells- introduces the new energy scale @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is wilson s discretization parameter . for @xmath75",
    "the fine structure ( on the scale of @xmath76 ) of the density of states does not change the properties of the system .",
    "conversely , for @xmath77 new confinement induced regimes are observed : for the system at - resonance , as the temperature is lowered , there is a rapid decrease in the magnetic moment @xmath78 when @xmath79 ; for the system off - resonance , as @xmath80 approaches @xmath19 the magnetic moment saturates leading to a plateau in the temperature dependence of @xmath78 , only at lower temperatures the screening is completed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this plateau can be interpreted as the behavior of an isolated cluster . only at very low temperatures",
    "the coupling with the host states becomes relevant and the complete screening can occur .",
    "the condition for the existence of these new regimes @xmath77 can be put in the form @xmath81 @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the kondo screening length of the infinite system . in other words , only if the kondo screening length is of the order or larger than the system size , the confinement effects become evident in the thermodynamic properties .     versus temperature .",

    "in fact the low temperature tail of @xmath91 can be scaled to define the effective energy scale @xmath92 for the low energy spin excitations .",
    "we have done this using two different criteria , one is simply to use wilson s result : @xmath93 to relate the low temperature susceptibility to an effective @xmath92 .",

    "in this last case the two characteristic temperatures are also reflected in the magnetic susceptibility from which we can extract their values as the onset and offset of the plateau in @xmath200 . as can be seen from the figure , as the temperature is lowered",
    ", the broad satellite at @xmath201 develops at a temperature corresponding to the onset of the plateau while a narrow kondo structure develops at a temperature corresponding to the offset of the plateau .",
    "the first and second temperatures at which the narrow kondo peak and the broad structure disappear indicate the decoupling of the impurity spin with the electron spin density at large ( @xmath202 ) and short ( @xmath203 ) distances respectively .",
    "we have presented a model for a kondo impurity in a nanoscopic sample or grain coupled with a reservoir through a large barrier .",
    "the natural energy - or length - scale associated to the kondo effect in a bulk material is to be compared with the new scale introduced by the confinement of electrons .",
    "these new scales modify the local density of states at the impurity site and consequently their thermodynamic and spectral properties .",

    "this regime with @xmath204 is characterized by a interplay between electron - electron correlation and confinement effects .",
    "the width of the kondo resonance ( @xmath205 ) and the characteristic energy ( @xmath40 ) that defines the structure of the local density of states are of the same order and as a consequence the kondo resonance shows a superstructure .",
    "when the fermi energy lies at a resonance , the low temperature spectral density consists of a broad structure around the fermi level . for large barriers",
    ", the spectrum presents a two peaked structure with a deep at the fermi level , where the distance between peaks is given by the kondo energy of the finite system . as the height of the barrier",
    "is decreased , the peaks merge into a single broader peak .    for the off - resonance case @xmath162 presents structures at @xmath149 and a central kondo - like peak at @xmath143 . in temperature dependence",
