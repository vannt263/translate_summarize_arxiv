    "the properties of the earliest galaxies , such as their star formation histories , masses , production of ionizing photons and their escape fraction , are crucial in understanding the reionization process , during which the previously neutral intergalactic medium ( igm ) becomes totally ionized .",
    "thanks to the availability of large ground - based and space telescopes , and improvements in the searching technique for lyman break galaxies and lyman-@xmath6 emitters , we are now tracing galaxy formation at progressively higher redshifts beyond 6 ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "candidates at redshifts as high as @xmath7 are newly reported from the analysis of the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ) @xcite .",
    "however , it is now believed that the galaxies that produced most of the necessary ( re)ionizing photons were dwarfs @xcite which are currently beyond our capability of direct detection .",
    "the forthcoming james webb space telescope ( jwst ) will have the capabilities to directly detect the reionization sources at the faint end of the luminosity function .",
    "still , given their faintness , long integration times will be required ; hence , defining target candidate reionizing sources will be of primary importance to study them in spectroscopic detail .    instead of looking at a specific galaxy directly",
    ", the redshifted 21 cm transition of hi traces the neutral gas either in the diffuse igm or in non - linear structures , comprising the most promising probe of the reionization process ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) . while the 21 cm tomography maps out the three dimensional structure of the 21 cm emission or absorption by the igm against the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ( e.g. @xcite ) , the 21 cm forest observation detects absorption lines of intervening structures towards high redshift radio sources showing high sensitivity to gas temperature @xcite .",
    "the problem of the 21 cm forest signatures produced by different kinds of structures has been addressed by several authors .",
    "@xcite presented a detailed study of 21 cm absorption by the mean neutral igm as well as filamentary structures based on the simulations of @xcite , but their box was too small to account for large scale structures and was not able to resolve collapsed objects .",
    "instead , @xcite used a simple analytic model to compute the absorption profiles and abundances of minihalos and galactic disks .",
    "later on , @xcite re - examined four kinds of 21 cm forest absorption signatures in a broader context , especially the transmission gaps produced by ionized bubbles .",
    "recently , @xcite developed a more detailed model of the 21 cm absorption lines of minihalos ( i.e. starless galaxies , mhs ) and dwarf galaxies ( star - forming galaxies , dgs ) during the epoch of reionization , explored the physical origins of the line profiles , and generated synthetic spectra of the 21 cm forest on top of both high-@xmath8 quasars and gamma ray burst ( grb ) afterglows .",
    "interestingly , they find that : ( i ) mhs and dgs show very distinct 21 cm line absorption profiles ( ii ) they contribute differently to the spectrum due to the mass segregation between the two populations .",
    "it follows that it is in principle possible to build a criterion based on the 21 cm forest spectrum to efficiently select dgs .",
    "the goal of this work is to derive the different signatures of dgs and mhs using a 21 cm spectrum of high-@xmath8 radio sources , and provide a criterion to pick dgs lines in the spectrum . for these candidates ,",
    "precise redshift information will be available ; moreover , given the angular position of the background source , the 21 cm forest observation provides an excellent tool for locating the high-@xmath8 dgs .",
    "the great advantage of using high-@xmath8 grbs as background radio sources is that the follow - up ir jwst observations after the afterglow has faded away will not be hampered by the presence of a very luminous source ( as in the case of a background quasar ) in the field , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 @xcite ] .",
    "here we briefly summarize the main features of the model used in this work , but refer the interested reader to @xcite for a more comprehensive description .",
    "we use the sheth - tormen halo mass function @xcite to model the halo number density at high redshift in the mass range @xmath14 , which covers the minimum mass allowed to collapse @xcite and most of the galaxies that are responsible for reionization @xcite .",
    "the dark matter halos have an nfw density profile within the virial radii @xmath15 @xcite , with a concentration parameter fitted to high - redshift simulation results by @xcite ; the dark matter density and velocity structure outside @xmath15 are described by an `` infall model''barkana / codes.html ] @xcite .",
    "the gas inside the @xmath15 is assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium at temperature @xmath16 in the dark matter potential , while the gas outside follows the dark matter overdensity and velocity field .",
    "once the halo population is fixed , a timescale criterion for star formation is introduced to determine whether a halo is capable of hosting star formation .",
    "the timescale required for turning on star formation is modeled as the maximum between the free - fall time @xmath17 and the h@xmath18 cooling time @xmath19 @xcite , i.e. @xmath20 . then star formation activity begins at @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the halo formation time predicted by the standard eps model @xcite .",
    "if @xmath23 is larger than the hubble time at the halo redshift , we define the system as a _",
    "minihalo _ ,",
    "i.e. a starless galaxy . the ionized fraction in a mh is computed with collisional ionization equilibrium , which depends on its temperature .",
    "the gas within @xmath15 is at the virial temperature , and in the absence of an x - ray background the gas outside is adiabatically compressed , so that the temperature is simply @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the adiabatic index for atomic hydrogen , and @xmath26 is the temperature of the mean - density igm .",
    "the ly@xmath6 photons inside a mh are produced by recombinations , which are negligible for most mhs that are almost neutral , but serve as a dominant coupling source for the most massive mhs which are partially ionized due to their higher @xmath27 .",
    "when the criterion @xmath28 is satisfied , star formation occurs within a hubble time turning the halo into a _",
    "dwarf galaxy_. we use a mass - dependent handy fit of star formation efficiency provided by @xcite . adopting the spectra of high redshift starburst galaxies provided by @xcite and an escape fraction of @xmath29",
    "as favored by the early reionization model ( erm , @xcite ) , we numerically follow the expansion of the hii region .",
    "the gas temperature inside the hii region is fixed at @xmath30 , while the temperature of gas around the hii region is calculated including the hubble expansion , soft x - ray heating and the compton heating .",
    "although the soft x - ray heating dominates over the compton heating , its effect is weak unless the dg has a higher stellar mass and/or a top - heavy initial mass function . besides ionization and heating effects",
    ", the dg metal - free stellar population produces ly@xmath6 photons from soft x - ray cascading , which could penetrate into the nearby igm and help to couple the spin temperature to the kinetic temperature of the gas",
    ". finally , we account for the ly@xmath6 background produced by the collective contribution of dgs .    with the detailed modeling of properties of both mhs and dwarf galaxies , and an associated ly@xmath6 background , we compute",
    "the 21 cm absorption lines of these non - linear structures .",
    "the diffuse igm creates a global decrement in the spectra of high-@xmath8 radio sources , on top of which mhs and dgs produce deep and narrow absorption lines .",
    "the 21 cm optical depth of an isolated object is @xcite : @xmath31 dx,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the einstein coefficient for the spontaneous decay of the 21 cm transition , @xmath33 is the neutral hydrogen number density , @xmath34 is the spin temperature , and @xmath35 is the doppler parameter of the gas , @xmath36 . here",
    "@xmath37 is the frequency difference from the line center in terms of velocity , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the rest frame frequency of the 21 cm line , and @xmath40 is bulk velocity of gas projected onto the line of sight at radius @xmath41",
    ". inside of the virial radius , the gas is thermalized , and @xmath42 , while the gas outside the virial radius has a bulk velocity contributed from both infall and hubble flow , which is predicted by the `` infall model . ''",
    "the coordinate @xmath43 is related to the radius @xmath41 by @xmath44 , where @xmath6 is the impact parameter of the penetrating line of sight in units of @xmath15 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we see that both ew distributions for dgs and mhs peak in the same region at @xmath45 - @xmath46 .",
    "this means that most of the dwarfs and mhs have comparable ews , and we can not distinguish them only from their ews .",
    "however , the distribution curves of their ews show different shapes . the ew distribution of dgs has a long tail at the small ew end , while mhs have a large - ew tail in the distribution curve",
    ".      in this subsection",
    ", we aim at deriving a criterion to distinguish between the absorption lines caused by dgs and those caused by mhs .    from the computation of ew distributions , we find that only dwarf galaxies cause negative absorptions and thus have @xmath3 , while only mhs are found to have ews above @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the first criterion for candidate dgs could be @xmath3 , with which we select 10 dwarfs out of 54 in our synthetic spectrum .",
    "they have a 100 percent probability of being caused by dgs .",
    "that means , we can find @xmath48 of the total dwarfs along the line of sight , and they are relatively large dwarfs with large hii regions . in addition , with the predicted ew distribution , we can estimate the total number of dgs in the spectrum with the number of selected dwarf galaxies that have negative absorptions . similarly , using the second criterion @xmath4 , we can select 812 mhs out of a total of 7108 .",
    "this is @xmath49 of all the mhs , which can not be misidentified as dgs .    from the correlation functions shown above , on the other hand",
    ", we see that dgs have a longer correlation length than mhs . in the absence of halo clustering information ,",
    "the correlation length reflects the mean width of the absorption lines , so this is also a distinctive signature of dwarfs from mhs .",
    "however , we have demonstrated that the correlation of dwarfs at relatively large frequency distances are exactly caused by those with negative absorptions .",
    "therefore , the criterion of broad absorption is degenerate with the negative tail of the ew distribution of the dgs . excluding those dwarfs with negative absorptions , the mean width of an absorption line of a dg ( about @xmath50 ) is even smaller than that of an mh ( about @xmath51 ) .",
    "hence , for the lines with @xmath52 , if we have infinite resolution , a narrower absorption line will have a higher probability of being caused by a dwarf galaxy .",
    "this is probably beyond the resolution capabilities of currently planned instruments .",
    "the probability of these absorption lines being a dg would be @xmath53 , with the complementary probability attributed to mhs .",
    "using the model developed by @xcite , we have computed 21 cm absorption line spectra ( `` forest '' ) caused by dgs and mhs separately , their flux correlation functions and ew distributions , with the aim of distinguishing dgs from mhs in a statistical way . with the selection criterion of @xmath3 , we are able to identify @xmath54 of dgs , and the criterion of @xmath4 selects @xmath55 of mhs . as a whole , we can disentangle @xmath56 of all the non - linear objects along a line of sight for which we can tell whether they are dgs or mhs . in this way",
    ", we find a strong but simple criterion to select candidate dgs to be later re - observed in the optical or infrared .",
    "using the radio afterglow of a high redshift grb as the background , this selection strategy could be accomplished by lofar or ska .",
    "then , after the grb fades away , the follow - up observations can be carried out by jwst , which will be capable of directly detecting the dgs that are responsible for reionization .",
    "cosmic voids can also produce negative absorptions with respect to the mean absorption by the igm .",
    "accounting for the density voids requires the clustering information of large scale structure which is not included in our computation . however , according to the void size distribution based on the excursion set model developed by @xcite , the characteristic scale of a density void is much larger than that of a dg hii region . as a result",
    ", density voids will produce `` transmissivity windows '' which are about one order of magnitude broader than the `` leaks '' produced by hii regions .",
    "as the width of both `` transmissivity windows '' and `` leaks '' exceed the current spectral resolution , a second criterion of signal width could be applied to eliminate those voids .",
    "further , it is not necessary to consider the so - called `` mixing problem '' between the density voids and the hii regions as @xcite did for the ly@xmath6 forest , because the dwarfs are more likely to exist in filaments out of the voids , and they are not likely to mix with the density voids .    while the selection criterion for candidate dgs is reliable , the total number of predicted dgs and the percentages of identifiable objects are model - dependent",
    "specifically , they depend on the star formation law and efficiency , stellar initial mass function , and @xmath57",
    ". however , the fraction of dwarfs having negative absorption depends only on the _ shape _ of the ew distribution .",
    "if different star formation models predict similar shapes of the ew distribution , then our prediction of the fraction of dwarfs producing leaks is quite reliable and model - independent , and the total number of dgs along a given line of sight can be safely inferred from the number of selected leaks .",
    "otherwise , we could compare the total number of dwarfs inferred from the percentage argument with the one originally predicted from our star formation model , and use this result to constrain the model .    to improve on the current selection criteria ,",
    "the next step is to include the clustering properties of dark matter halos . with",
    "this ingredient included , the correlation functions will retain additional information on the distances between the lines . in principle , knowing the shape of the correlation function , one could associate to any given line in the spectrum ( e.g. by using bayesian methods ) the statistical probability that it arises from a dg .",
    "we reserve these and other aspects to future work .",
