    "the nature of the rapid increase in viscosity as liquids are cooled toward the glass transition is the subject of many theoretical approaches , however , there is no consensus on its fundamental mechanism @xcite .",
    "one plausible scenario is that dense packing leads to self - induced memory effects , which causes slow dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , the recent discovery of dynamic heterogeneities , i.e. , spatial heterogeneities in the relaxation dynamics that emerge on supercooling @xcite , is suggestive of the importance of a growing dynamic length scale in the slowing down approaching the glass transition .",
    "in addition to this dynamical phenomenon , the idea of a structural change leading to vitrification has a long history @xcite and recently it has become clear that a range of glass formers show a change in structure upon the emergence of slow dynamics .",
    "two generic types of structure have been identified : spatially extendable crystal - like ordering @xcite , and non - extendable polyhedral ordering @xcite .",
    "the latter concerns particles organized into polyhedra @xcite which can not tile euclidean space due to geometrical frustration @xcite .",
    "thus they form ramified structures whose fractal dimension is less that the dimensionality of the system , i.e. , non - extendable ordering .",
    "metallic glasses can exhibit this second kind of ordering @xcite .",
    "other `` order - agnostic '' schemes have been devised where structural correlations not related to a specific motif have also been identified @xcite .    to strengthen the link between structure and dynamics , two approaches",
    "have been employed : firstly , dynamically slow regions have been correlated with local ordering .",
    "secondly , emergence of structural and dynamic length scales , which grow similarly , has been sought .",
    "the former links structure to dynamical heterogeneity and has been identified in glass formers with both crystal - like ordering @xcite and non - extendable polyhedral ordering @xcite .",
    "the latter case of growing structural and dynamic length scales is more controversial .",
    "one of us has identified a direct correspondence between the growing dynamical length scale and a structural length scale in polydisperse hard spheres with crystal - like ordering @xcite , while others have not @xcite . in the case of binary lennard - jones ( kob - andersen )",
    "mixtures , only weakly growing structural length scales have been identified by a `` point - to - set '' analysis @xcite , while other approaches using static perturbation of inherent structures @xcite and finite size scaling @xcite find a much stronger increase of static length scales .",
    "similarly , for binary hard and soft sphere mixtures , no local ordering , nor one - to - one correspondence between a growing structural length scale and the growing dynamical length scale has been found @xcite , but again static perturbation did suggest a growing structural length scale @xcite .    in some glass formers ,",
    "local polyhedral ordering in the form of icosahedra has been related to an underlying ( quasi- ) crystalline structure @xcite .",
    "the wahnstrm mixture @xcite used here is a commonly studied binary lennard - jones model glass - former of large ( @xmath0 ) and small ( @xmath1 ) particles .",
    "this model can crystallize upon formation of a structure that contains icosahedra composed of six @xmath0 and six @xmath1 species around a central @xmath1-type particle , which can tile space with the inclusion of frank - kasper bonds @xcite . for this model",
    "it was shown that icosahedral order develops upon cooling and a link to slow dynamics has been suggested @xcite .",
    "thus the wahnstrm mixture provides an intriguing case where icosahedra are found both the in the spatially extendable crystal and in non - extendable networks . in this work ,",
    "we find the latter . the purpose of this work is threefold : ( i ) to identify any structural origin for dynamic heterogeneities directly by measuring a structure - specific time correlation function of clusters detected by a topological algorithm .",
    "( ii ) to elucidate the microscopic mechanism by which structured icosahedral domains determine the dynamics , and identify the role that local crystalline ordering plays in this process .",
    "( iii ) to understand the behavior of correlation lengths for the sizes of the structured domains and those for the dynamical heterogeneities . to address these points",
    ", we use the wahnstrm mixture @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sectionmethodology ] , we provide details of our simulations and analysis , outlining the dynamic topological cluster classification used to elucidate long - lived structural motifs . in our results section [ sectionresults ] , we show that , of the structures we consider , icosahedral clusters of 13 particles are exceptionally long - lived . these long - lived icosahedra form a network which is correlated with dynamically slow regions , and which acts to slow down neighboring particles .",
    "we further show that , although the crystal structure of the wahnstrm mixture is also formed of icosahedra of a specific composition of the a and b particles , these form only a small subset of icosahedra in the supercooled liquid .",

    "[ fig : dyn_het](b ) .",
    "all three correlation lengths increase on cooling . for the lowest temperature studied , the network of icosahedra percolates , thus @xmath96 can not be defined , suggesting a divergence in a structural length scale at a temperature higher than that inferred from the dynamic correlation length @xmath98 . thus percolating domains of icosahedra do not imply structural arrest ( see the discussion in sec .",
    "iii.c ) : since icosahedra have a finite lifetime , the formation of a network does not lead to arrest , unlike the case of colloidal gels @xcite .",
    "the length @xmath128 grows more slowly than @xmath98 as the domains of icosahedra are smaller than the immobile regions selected by the four - point dynamic susceptibility @xmath100 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_het](a ) ] .",
    "this result is expected because domains of icosahedra in this liquid form rarefied networks with @xmath84 which do not fill space .",
    "it is unlikely that this difference would be rectified by including the immediate neighbors of icosahedral domains when calculating the structural correlation lengths , because there are large numbers of neighbors of icosahedral domains that are found at the lowest temperatures .",
    "we also find that there are a fraction of the particles within icosahedral clusters that are not selected in the calculation of @xmath106 ( i.e. their displacement over @xmath88 is greater than 0.3 , meaning that there is not a perfect correlation between the structured and the slow particles .",
    "note @xmath129 has been shown to exhibit dependence upon system size for @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "we expect that such effects are reasonably small here , and have taken care to only consider temperatures where all our measured lengths are much smaller than the system size . while system size effects can not be ruled out , we do not believe these make a significant impact on the conclusions we draw .",
    "the result for this wahnstrm mixture contrasts with liquids with crystal - like order . in some work , this has been found to scale with @xmath106 , @xcite .",
    "other methods have also shown that structural correlation lengths are rather larger in the case of such liquids @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the icosahedral clusters which form the domains have arrangements of the @xmath0- and @xmath1-species that are rarely compatible with the crystal structure .",
    "only 10% of the particles within icosahedral domains are members of clusters in the crystal structure .",
    "thus , although an icosahedral structure itself is a key structural motif of the frank - kasper crystal , icosahedral clusters formed in a supercooled liquid have a rather weak link to the crystal structure [ fig .",
    "[ fig : gcryst13afk](b ) ] , presumably due to entropic frustration @xcite of the chemical arrangement of the species within the cluster .",
    "the difference in the nature of the structural fluctuations between this model and those with spatially extendable crystal - like order may be responsible for the difference in the @xmath131-dependence of @xmath106 : @xmath132 is found here whereas @xmath133 for liquids with extendable crystal - like @xcite or amorphous order @xcite . thus , the question remains as to the most appropriate structural correlation length to explain the viscous slowing down of supercooled liquids , and how order - specific correlation lengths , such as @xmath96 and @xmath97 , might relate to order - agnostic structural correlation lengths @xcite .",
    "we also note that fig .",
    "[ fig : frac_dim](f ) strongly indicates that the effect of the domains on the surrounding particles extends around @xmath134 from the domains , showing that the dynamical effect of icosahedral clusters is not just limited to their domains .",
    "thus icosahedral clusters may act to slow some of their neighboring particles to form regions of slow dynamics , which appear correlated with spatial patterns of dynamic heterogeneities [ fig .",
    "4(a ) ] , although this should be carefully checked .",
    "we have demonstrated that studying the lifetimes of structural ordering within the wahnstrm supercooled liquid can be used to directly identify the order that constitutes the slow regions of dynamic heterogeneities .",
    "the structures responsible , the icosahedra , combine to form non - space filling domains on cooling that become more stable as their size increases .",
    "here , the crystal structure also has an icosahedral component , but icosahedra compatible with the crystal are rarely found in the supercooled liquid .",
    "particles that neighbor the domains have suppressed mobility .",
    "these results imply that growing domains of icosahedra play an important in the microscopic origins of dynamic heterogeneities in this system . at the same time",
    ", the lack of a direct link in the length scales associated with structure and dynamics requires further study on the origin of slow dynamics including the mechanism of propagation of slowness from icosahedral clusters to their neighbors .",
