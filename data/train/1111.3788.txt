    "the numerical integration scheme of the orbit - averaged fokker - planck ( fp ) equation developed by @xcite has been one of the most useful tools for simulating the dynamical evolution of globular star clusters .",
    "in addition to two - body relaxation , many physical processes have been incorporated into fp models to achieve realistic modelling of the globular cluster evolution ; these processes include tidal cutoff , binary heating , disc and bulge shocks , mass loss via stellar evolution , etc .",
    "( see @xcite for a recent example of detailed fp modelling ) .",
    "in this paper we consider the dynamical evolution of globular clusters in a steady galactic tidal field .",
    "our main purpose is to investigate what boundary condition can give a better description of escape of stars from clusters in the tidal field .",
    "this study has been motivated by the studies by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that a large fraction of stars with energies above the escape energy ( i.e. potential escapers ) take much longer escape time than the dynamical time . until their study it had been generally thought that the escape time - scale is of the order of the dynamical time and that the mass - loss times of the clusters essentially scale with the relaxation time , which is much longer than the dynamical time .",
    "the findings of @xcite indicate that this simple scaling may be spoiled by potential escapers with long escape times .",
    "in fact @xcite performed @xmath0-body simulations and showed that the mass - loss times ( lifetimes ) of clusters do not scale with the relaxation time @xmath6 but scale with @xmath7 .",
    "he concluded that the reason is that some of potential escapers are scattered back to lower energies before they leave the cluster .",
    "more recently @xcite showed that the dependence on the relaxation time changes with the strength of the tidal filed .",
    "these two studies have revealed that the behavior of potential escapers greatly influences the rate of mass loss from clusters in the tidal field .",
    "the effects of long escape times and re - scattering of potential escapers have never been considered in previous fp models in the literature , but it was assumed that escapers leave a cluster on the dynamical time - scale , as is described in detail in section  [ sec : fp ] . since the effect of the galactic tidal field is essentially important to the cluster evolution , it is necessary to find a way to include the effect into fp models as precisely as possible .",
    "we should mention that takahashi & portegies zwart ( 1998 , 2000 ) compared fp and @xmath0-body models of star clusters in the tidal field and found good agreement between these two theoretical models over a wide range of initial conditions .",
    "they showed that the use of anisotropic fp models with the apocentre escape criterion @xcite and the dynamical - time removal of escapers @xcite is necessary to obtain such good agreement .",
    "however , note that in their @xmath0-body models the tidal force field is not included but the tidal cutoff is applied . @xcite confirmed that the difference between tidal cutoff and self - consistent tidal field @xmath0-body models is small for a particular set of initial conditions , but did not do systematic investigations on this problem .    in this study",
    "we have devised a new scheme to treat escapers in fp models .",
    "the scheme defines a region of potential escapers in phase space and allows them to be scattered again . comparing the results of fp models calculated with the new scheme with the results of @xmath0-body models , we examine the accuracy of the fp models .",
    "the orbit - averaged fp equation is derived under the assumption of spherical symmetry of star clusters @xcite",
    ". therefore the tidal field , which is not spherically symmetric , can not be directly incorporated into orbit - averaged fp models . in fp models",
    "the effect of the tidal field is taken into account by imposing a tidal cutoff radius @xmath8 on the cluster , which is treated as an isolated system in other respects . under these assumptions",
    "the distribution function @xmath9 of stars at time @xmath10 depends only on the energy of a star per unit mass , @xmath11 , and the angular momentum per unit mass , @xmath12 .",
    "first we summarise classical treatments of escapers used in fp models of previous studies .      in previous studies ,",
    "two kinds of criteria were adopted to define an escape region in @xmath13-space :    1 .",
    "energy criterion @xmath14 2 .",
    "apocentre criterion @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the cluster mass and @xmath17 is the apocentre radius of a star having energy @xmath11 and angular momentum @xmath12 .",
    "it is assumed that a star is destined to escape once it enters into the escape region .",
    "the apocentre criterion @xcite is considered to be more realistic , at least as long as the tidal field is modelled as a radial cut - off , and in fact gives better agreement between fp and @xmath0-body models @xcite . for isotropic fp models , where the distribution function does not depend on @xmath12 , only the energy criterion can be applied ( e.g. @xcite ) .      in previous studies stars in the escape region",
    "are assumed to leave the cluster inevitably , as mentioned above .",
    "it is also assumed that the time required for this travel is of the order of the dynamical time at the tidal radius . considering this travel time , @xcite applied the following equation to the distribution function @xmath9 in the escape region : @xmath18^{1/2 }          /t_{\\rm tid } , \\label{eq : lo}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is a dimensionless constant determining the efficiency of escape ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the time - scale @xmath19 is an orbital time - scale at the tidal radius defined by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the mean mass density within the tidal radius .",
    "since the dynamical time is generally much smaller than the relaxation time in globular clusters , we may assume that escapers leave the cluster immediately after they enter into the escape region , when we are interested only in the evolution on the relaxation time - scale .",
    "this assumption leads to the boundary condition @xmath22 on the tidal boundary ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the boundary condition of equation ( [ eq : lo ] ) takes account of the fact that stars satisfying the escape criterion , i.e. potential escapers , need time to actually leave the cluster .",
    "however the effect of re - scattering of potential escapers is not considered there . here",
    "we propose a new scheme in which the re - scattering effect is taken into account .",
    "first we summarise basic assumptions and equations .",
    "suppose that the cluster is on a circular orbit , with radius @xmath23 and angular velocity @xmath24 , round the centre of a spherical galaxy .",
    "we consider the motion of a star in the rotating coordinate system moving with the cluster ; the origin is at the cluster centre , the @xmath25-axis points to the galactic centre , and the @xmath26-axis is in the cluster orbital plane .",
    "if the cluster and the galaxy are treated as point masses @xmath16 and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) and the size of the cluster is much smaller than @xmath23 , there exists a conserved quantity known as the jacobi integral given by @xmath29 ( cf .",
    "@xcite , chapt . 5 ) .",
    "here @xmath30 is the velocity of the star measured in the rotating frame , @xmath31 is the distance from the star to the cluster centre , and the angular velocity @xmath24 is given by @xmath32 the third term on the right - side in equation ( [ eq : ej ] ) is a combination of the centrifugal and tidal potentials .",
    "the effective potential is defined as @xmath33 a contour plot of @xmath34 is shown , e.g. , in fig .",
    "5.1 of @xcite .",
    "the effective potential has the saddle points at @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 the equipotential surface passing through these saddle points intersects with the @xmath26-axis at @xmath38 , where @xmath39 the necessary condition for escape of a star from the cluster is given by @xmath40 note that equations ( [ eq : pxe ] ) , ( [ eq : ye ] ) , and ( [ eq : ejcrit ] ) are valid for any spherical galactic potential .",
    "@xcite found that the time - scale for escape of stars with @xmath41 varies as @xmath42    with this relation in mind we have devised a new scheme to follow the evolution of potential escapers . in this scheme the evolution of the distribution function @xmath9 for potential escapers is described by @xmath43 where the first term on the right - side is the fp collision term and the second term represents mass loss due to escape . here the escape time - scale @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 where @xmath3 is a dimensionless numerical constant .",
    "it should be noted that energy @xmath11 , not the jacobi integral @xmath46 , is used in equations ( [ eq : fp_pe ] ) and ( [ eq : te ] ) .",
    "energy @xmath11 does not include the centrifugal and tidal potentials . despite this difference",
    ", we use the same critical value of energy @xmath47 where the tidal radius @xmath8 is identified with @xmath48 .",
    "one might think that using equation ( [ eq : te ] ) with equation ( [ eq : ecrit ] ) is too crude an approximation , but it brings good agreement between fp and @xmath0-body models as is shown in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the most important difference between equations ( [ eq : lo ] ) and ( [ eq : fp_pe ] ) is that the latter includes the collision term .",
    "thus equation ( [ eq : fp_pe ] ) allows potential escapers to be scattered back to lower energies . the effect of mass loss is included in both equations in a similar way , though the functional forms of the escape time - scale @xmath44 are different .    in this new treatment of the tidal field ,",
    "the escape criteria described in section  [ sec : esc_crit ] are modified as follows :    1 .",
    "energy criterion @xmath49 2 .",
    "apocentre criterion @xmath50    note that @xmath51 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : fp_pe ] ) is applied only in the region where an adopted criterion is satisfied .",
    "the fp code used in the present study is essentially the same as that used by @xcite , but adopts the new scheme for treating escapers described above .",
    "the code calculates the evolution of the distribution function @xmath52 . unlike @xcite , stellar evolution",
    "is not considered in the models presented in this paper .",
    "instead the effect of heating by three - body binaries is considered in the manner described in @xcite .    for all the models presented in the present paper , 201 energy mesh points , 51 angular - momentum mesh points , and 101 radial mesh points are used .",
    "the meshes are constructed as described in @xcite .",
    "when calculating the evolution of multi - mass clusters , 10 discrete mass - components are used to represent a continuous mass function .",
    "our fp models have two free parameters : one is @xmath3 in equation  ( [ eq : te ] ) and the other is @xmath1 in the coulomb logarithm @xmath2 appearing in the fp collision term .",
    "how the value of @xmath3 is determined is described in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we set @xmath53 @xcite in most of our runs and @xmath54 @xcite in a part of runs for multi - mass clusters .",
    "first we compare fp models with the full tidal field models of @xcite and additional @xmath0-body runs performed for this comparison .",
    "all the model clusters are composed of equal - mass stars and move on circular orbits round a point - mass galaxy .",

    "results are presented in @xmath0-body units , where the initial total mass and energy of a cluster are equal to 1 and @xmath55 , respectively , and the gravitational constant @xmath56 .",

    "the reason for this discrepancy is not clear at present , but there is a possibility that very early core - collapse in the models with @xmath69 is , at least partially , responsible for it . the fpf model with @xmath4 and @xmath69 experiences core collapse ( bounce ) at @xmath71 for @xmath58 , and at @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "the coulomb logarithm may take different values for pre - collapse and post - collapse stages ( see the next section ) , which affects the time - scale of the evolution of fp models .",
    "we have shown that fp models can well follow the mass evolution of star clusters in a tidal field if a new scheme for treating potential escapers is implemented .",
    "this is the first time the effect of re - scattering of potential escapers has been taken into account in fp models .",
    "although takahashi & portegies zwart ( 1998 , 2000 ) showed that anisotropic fp models are in good agreement with @xmath0-body models for the mass evolution of star clusters in a galaxy , the tidal field is treated as a tidal cutoff rather than an actual force field . in the present study",
    "we have found that our new fp models are in good agreement with @xmath0-body models calculated with the inclusion of the tidal force field .",
    "thus the new scheme has improved the accuracy of fp models .",
    "@xcite argued that some potential escapers are scattered back to lower energies before they leave the cluster and that this complicates the scaling of the mass - loss time .",
    "the success of our models is consistent with his argument .",
    "actually our equation for potential escapers , equation  ( [ eq : fp_pe ] ) , can be regarded as a generalization of the equation of his toy model , his equation ( 12 ) , used for explaining the scaling @xmath74 .",
    "the toy model of @xcite is useful for giving us insight into the effect of potential escapers on the cluster evolution . on the other hand",
    ", the results presented in subsection  [ ssec : escape_time ] have revealed the limitation of the model . when the energy dependence of the escape time is artificially changed from the true one",
    ", the toy model does not correctly explain the results of our fp models .",
    "this failure of the toy model is not a big surprise , because it is only a simplified model based on many assumptions , some of which are not very realistic .",
    "for example , our simulations show that an exact steady state is never established , but the toy model assumes a steady state .",
    "in addition , the scaling of the cluster lifetime depends on the strength of the tidal field , as found by @xcite and confirmed by the present study , but the toy model does not take account of the strength of the tidal field .",
    "our fp models show good agreement with @xmath0-body models not only for single - mass clusters but also for multi - mass clusters .",
    "however , we have encountered a difficulty in determining proper values of the two parameters , @xmath1 and @xmath3 , in the fp models .",
    "as shown in subsection  [ ssec : multi - mass ] , the parameter set @xmath4 brings good agreement for both single - mass and multi - mass clusters .",
    "since the escape time - scale @xmath44 given by equation  ( [ eq : te ] ) is expected to be independent of stellar mass , it is natural that the same value of the parameter @xmath3 is applicable to both single - mass and multi - mass clusters .    on the other hand ,",
    "the value of @xmath1 is expected to depend on the stellar mass function .",
    "@xcite argued theoretically that the value of @xmath1 is generally smaller in multi - mass clusters than in single - mass clusters . based on the results of @xmath0-body simulations",
    ", @xcite obtained a value of @xmath53 for isolated single - mass clusters , and @xcite obtained a much smaller value , @xmath54 , for isolated multi - mass clusters having an imf similar to the imf used in our simulations .",
    "when we adopt the value of @xmath54 for multi - mass clusters , we have to use a much larger value of @xmath3 , @xmath75 , than the best value of @xmath59 for single - mass clusters , in order to obtain good agreement with @xmath0-body models .",
    "thus we have not found a parameter set satisfying both the independence of @xmath3 on the mass function and the dependence of @xmath1 on it .",
    "it needs further investigation to solve this incompatibility , but even the determination of @xmath1 itself is not a simple task .",
    "for example , @xcite obtained the best value of @xmath76 by examining the post - collapse evolution of @xmath0-body models of isolated single - mass clusters .",
    "this value is much smaller than the value of @xmath53 obtained for pre - collapse single - mass clusters .",
    "these results suggest that the value of @xmath1 changes along with the evolution of clusters . it may also change with radius within a cluster @xcite .",
    "@xcite theoretically estimated not only the energy dependence of the escape time - scale @xmath44 but also its numerical coefficient , which is given in their equation ( 9 ) .",
    "if we ignore the difference between energy @xmath11 and the jacobi integral @xmath46 , their estimate for a @xmath57 king model leads to a value of @xmath77 .",
    "this is about four times larger than our best value of @xmath59 for single - mass clusters .",
    "however , @xcite also did numerical experiments and found that their theoretical estimate of @xmath44 is too small ; escape time - scales obtained from the numerical experiments are more than a few times larger than the theoretical one .",
    "therefore our value @xmath59 is not inconsistent with the result of @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our value of @xmath75 for multi - mass clusters with @xmath54 is a little larger than their theoretical estimate .",
    "another issue not addressed in the present paper is how the mass profile of the parent galaxy affects the results . in all the simulations presented here",
    "we assume that the parent galaxy is represented by a point mass . on the other hand , @xcite showed that the mass - loss time - scale depends on the mass profile of the parent galaxy ; the time - scale increases as the mass profile gets shallower .",
    "therefore we expect that the parameter @xmath3 depends on the mass profile of the parent galaxy .",
    "this issue will be examined in a future study .",
    "in this paper we have developed new fp models of globular clusters in a steady galactic tidal field .",
    "our fp models are novel in the method of treating escapers : potential escapers are allowed to experience gravitational scattering with other stars before they really leave clusters .",
    "the new method has been devised in order to construct more realistic models of star clusters in a tidal field compared to simple tidal - cutoff models as in previous studies .",
    "the mass evolution of clusters in a tidal field does not simply scale with the relaxation time , and our fp models are in good agreement with @xmath0-body models in this respect .",
    "our fp models include two parameters @xmath1 and @xmath3 ; @xmath1 is the numerical factor in the coulomb logarithm @xmath2 and @xmath3 adjusts the speed of the tidal mass loss .",
    "we have determined the best values of @xmath3 for given values of @xmath1 by comparing fp results with @xmath0-body results . for single - mass clusters",
    "the best parameter set is @xmath4 .",
    "this parameter set is applicable to multi - mass clusters as well , but another set @xmath5 does work equally well as long as multi - mass clusters are concerned .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 is expected to depend on the mass profile of the parent galaxy , though a point - mass galaxy is assumed in all the simulations of the present paper .",
    "further investigation is required for the determination of the best values of the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath3 under various conditions .",
    "while fp models are generally thought to be less faithful models of globular clusters than @xmath0-body models , the present study has significantly improved the accuracy of fp models .",
    "an advantage of fp models is that they can be calculated much faster than @xmath0-body models",
    ". therefore fp models are particularly useful when we need to calculate a huge number of models .",
    "for example , when we try to specify the initial conditions of individual clusters , we have to perform simulations for many sets of the initial conditions , because the parameter space to be searched is very large .",
    "we believe that our fp models is quite useful for such searching .",
