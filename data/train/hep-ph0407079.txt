    "the first calculation of the full @xmath0 corrections to @xmath2 was presented at the radcor / l&l 2002 workshop@xcite . since then",
    ", several authors published the radiative corrections to several important @xmath3 processes : @xmath4@xcite , @xmath5@xcite , @xmath6@xcite , @xmath7@xcite , @xmath8@xcite , and @xmath9@xcite .",
    "now , full ew 1-loop calculations are well under control for @xmath3 processes in the sm . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the case for a @xmath10 process .    as a first trial",
    "we take a typical lep-2 process @xmath11 .",
    "although a status report on a similar attempt has appeared@xcite , there still is no complete result .",
    "for lep2 experiments , the double pole approximation(dpa)@xcite and the fermion loop scheme@xcite were used to predict the cross sections for @xmath12 4-fermions .",
    "they have the following features:(1 ) gauge invariance is guaranteed .",
    "( 2 ) it was sensible to split all 10 tree diagrams(cc10 ) into the doubly resonant ones(cc03 ) and others .",
    "the constant width is introduced in a naive way . in the energy region at the future linear - collider , however , non - cc03 diagrams are not negligible . for example , at @xmath13 gev , the tree level cross sections for cc03 and cc10 are 213.56 fb and 222.39 fb , respectively .",
    "the difference between them reaches 4% .",
    "therefore , the size of the radiative corrections to cc10 should be carefully estimated at the tev energy region .",
    "grace/1-loop@xcite has been used for the calculation which proceeds through the following steps : 1 ) evaluation of the numerators , for which the symbolic manipulation system is used . in order to shorten the size of the matrix elements , the fermion masses @xmath14 , @xmath15",
    "are neglected when integrating over phase space .",
    "2 ) evaluation of the loop integrals .",
    "after 5- and 6-point integrals are reduced to 4-point functions , ff@xcite and other analytic formulas are invoked for 4- , 3-and 2-point integrals .",
    "all masses are kept in the loop integrals .",
    "3 ) construction of kinematics . here",
    "masses are also kept exactly .",
    "the amplitude with 5-point function@xcite is t^(5 ) & & , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 and @xmath19 is a combination of external momenta .    multiplying the identities g^=_i , j=1 ^ 4 s_i^(a^-1)_ijs_j^ , with the loop momentum @xmath20 , l^&=&_i , js_i^(a^-1)_ij(l s_j ) , + & = & _ i , j(a^-1)_ij(d_j - d_0-_j)s_i^ , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 , we can reduce the numerator to l_l _ l_=_i , j(a^-1)_ij ( d_i - d_0-_i)s_j^l _ l_. [ eq : id1 ]    this method is also applicable for the reduction of a 6-point function to a sum of 4-point functions .",
    "there is also a standard reduction method where the following identity is used ; l^2=_i , j(l s_i)a_ij(l s_j ) . [ eq : id2 ] because this method not only raises the rank of the momentum tensor in the numerator but makes the resultant source codes very lengthy compared with eq.[eq : id1 ] , grace/1-loop uses this identity only as an option .",
    "as mentioned the system employs the ff package for the evaluation of 4-point functions .",
    "it happens , however , that this package leads to numerical instabilities or inconsistency in some cases having to do with some infra - red boxes .",
    "this occurs for instance when an internal massless particle is involved in some non - ir boxes like those obtained from a 6-point function as shown in fig.1 .",
    "some infra - red boxes also need to be regulated by the introduction of a width for the particle(@xmath23 or @xmath24 ) circulating in the loop .",
    "we implement a constant fixed width for such cases .",
    "for all these particular cases we use special in - house routines .",
    "for the computations we performed till now these routines have worked quite well for any @xmath25 and all @xmath26 one - loop processes . however , for the problem at hand , we have met a difficulty in carrying out the evaluation of a @xmath27-point function when the @xmath23 width is required .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "one - loop amplitudes of the full @xmath28 diagrams for @xmath29 were generated by the grace/1-loop system .",
    "non - linear gauge invariance has shown the consistency of the full set of amplitudes and the system itself . a new reduction algorithm from a 6-point function to 4-point",
    "function works well .",
    "a finite decay width brings a serious breaking of gauge invariance , particularly for 5-point infrared integrals .",
    "it is clear now that the radiative corrections to @xmath30 processes are calculable , though more improvements are inevitable .",
