    "the propagation of vibrational excitations in disordered media is one of the important problems in condensed matter physics",
    ". microscopic nature of these vibrational excitations is still poorly understood , despite that they are responsible for the specific heat , the thermal conductivity and the sound propagation in amorphous materials .    in 1999",
    "allen and feldman proposed a simple classification of vibrations in disordered media  @xcite , which was based on the numerical simulations of amorphous silicon .",
    "the low - frequency vibrations are longitudinal ( la ) or transverse ( ta ) plane waves ( acoustic phonons ) .",
    "the mean free path of phonons decreases rapidly with frequency due to structural or dynamical disorder . at some frequency @xmath2",
    "thz the mean free path of phonons becomes comparable with its wavelength .",
    "it is a so - called ioffe - regel criterion .",
    "however , the mobility edge @xmath3 for vibration localization is much higher then @xmath4 what is not the case for electron localization .",
    "vibrations in amorphous materials in this relatively wide frequency range @xmath5 are delocalized but not propagated as phonons .",
    "these vibrations were called _ diffusons _ because they spread by means of diffusion  @xcite .",
    "however , this picture can not clearly explain the prominent peak ( more than 3 times in the value ) in the diffusivity of vibrations in amorphous silicon between 7 and 13 thz @xcite .",
    "allen and feldman noticed that the sharp rise of the diffusivity at 7 thz corresponds to the end of ta branch in crystalline si which is responsible for the local minimum in the vibrational density of states .",
    "so the frequency 7 thz marks a point in the spectrum where vibrations change their character from somewhat ta - like , to somewhat la - like with much larger group velocity",
    ". however the notions of transverse and longitudinal vibrations are ill defined for such big frequencies in amorphous silicon .    in this paper",
    "we will generalize the notions of transverse and longitudinal vibrations for disordered systems like amorphous silicon .",
    "as an example we study numerically the model amorphous silicon ( a - si ) system consisting of @xmath6 atoms contained in a periodic cubic box of lengths @xmath7 of approximately 87  .",
    "the technical details of the preparation of the a - si sample have already been presented in ref .",
    "the si - si interaction in the amorphous silicon studied here is well described by the stillinger - weber potential  @xcite .",
    "low - frequency vibrations even in amorphous media are well - defined plane longitudinal and transverse waves . these vibrations can be described in continuous medium approximation .",
    "the displacement fields @xmath8 for longitudinal ( l ) and transverse ( t ) waves have a form @xmath9 however , this definition contains the phonon wavevector @xmath0 , which is ill - defined for high - frequency vibrations in amorphous medium . to generalize this approach",
    "let us note that @xmath10 the transverse displacement @xmath11 has zero divergence so it conserves local volumes .",
    "the natural analog of the local volumes in amorphous media are voronoi cells around each atom .",
    "the voronoi cell @xmath12 , associated with the atom @xmath13 is the set of all points in the space around this atom whose distance to the atom position @xmath14 is not greater than their distance to the other atoms @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "this type of cells is also known as wigner - seitz cells in crystallography for regular crystals .",
    "figure  [ fig : sql ] shows a simple example of voronoi cells for longitudinal and transverse waves in a simple quadratic lattice .",
    "a longitudinal wave evidently changes the volumes of voronoi cells while the transverse wave does not change the volumes despite the change in the form of the cells .    a displacement of atoms in amorphous media may ( or may not ) change volumes of voronoi cells .",
    "we will call the displacement of atoms @xmath16 to be transverse if it does not change the volumes of all voronoi cells . for",
    "that let us introduce a matrix @xmath17 which is responsible for the relative change of the @xmath13th voronoi cell volume @xmath18 under @xmath19th atom displacement in the direction @xmath20",
    "@xmath21 the explicit formula for the matrix @xmath17 will be derived in the next section . using this matrix the displacement of @xmath19th atom in the direction @xmath20",
    ", @xmath22 produces the following relative change of the voronoi cell volumes @xmath23 in the matrix notation this equation reads @xmath24 where @xmath17 is a rectangular @xmath25 matrix ( with @xmath26 being the number of particles ) and @xmath27 is a displacement vector with @xmath28 elements .",
    "the matrix @xmath17 is a discrete analog of the divergence operator .        by definition",
    "the transverse component @xmath29 of the displacement @xmath27 is such that @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath29 is the projection of the displacement @xmath27 to the _ null space _ of the matrix @xmath17 .",
    "the longitudinal component @xmath31 is a remaining orthogonal component of the displacement field and it is the projection of @xmath27 to the _ row space _ of the matrix @xmath17 .",
    "these projections have the following form  @xcite @xmath32 indeed , @xmath29 does not change the voronoi cell volumes @xmath33 and @xmath31 is orthogonal to @xmath29 @xmath34",
    "let us show how matrix @xmath17 can be derived from geometry only .",
    "let we shift only the atom @xmath19 by the vector @xmath35 ( figure  [ fig : vor ] ) .",
    "the vector @xmath35 is small so the voronoi cells after shifting have almost the same structure , but their facets are slightly shifted and rotated in space .",
    "the shifting @xmath35 of the atom @xmath19 can change the volume @xmath18 of a nearest neighbor cell @xmath13 . by definition the cells @xmath13 and @xmath19 are nearest neighbors if they have a common facet @xmath36 .    by definition of the voronoi cell",
    "the facet @xmath36 lies in the plane @xmath37 , which has the normal @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the vector connecting atoms @xmath13 and @xmath19 and go through the point @xmath40 .",
    "therefore the equation for this plane reads @xmath41 after shifting of the atom @xmath19 the new facet @xmath42 lies in the plane @xmath43 which satisfy the equation @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the signed distance from an arbitrary point @xmath48 to the plane @xmath43 is @xmath49 this distance has the sign `` @xmath50 '' if @xmath48 lies on the same side to the plane @xmath43 as the atom @xmath13 and the sign `` @xmath51 '' if @xmath48 lies on the opposite side to the plane .",
    "if @xmath48 lies in the plane @xmath43 then the distance @xmath52 is equal to 0 and we get the eq .",
    "( [ eq : pl ] ) . in the linear approximation on @xmath53 the change of the volume",
    "@xmath18 is the integral of @xmath52 over the surface of the initial facet @xmath36 @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are correspondingly the area and the centroid of the facet @xmath36 . in the linear approximation on @xmath53 , the eq .",
    "( [ eq : dvi1 ] ) reads @xmath57 where we have taken into account that @xmath58 because @xmath59 .     and",

    "is the center of the segment @xmath36 .",
    "b ) dashed lines shows the voronoi cells after shifting of the atom @xmath19 by the vector @xmath35 .",
    "the point @xmath62 denotes the position of @xmath63 .",
    "green and red areas show the increasing and decreasing of the @xmath18 respectively . ]    if all neighboring atoms shift , the change of the volume @xmath18 can be written in the matrix form @xmath64 the nondiagonal elements of the matrix @xmath65 we have already found above @xmath66 the diagonal element @xmath67 means the change of the @xmath13th voronoi cell volume under shifting of the @xmath13th atom itself .",
    "shifting of the all atoms by the same vector does not change the volumes of the voronoi cells .",
    "therefore @xmath68 after dividing by the volume we finally get the matrix @xmath17 @xmath69 it is notable that finite - elements methods also often use voronoi cells and have a similar definition for the finite differences for the divergence operator  @xcite .",
    "( red line ) . the relative number of the transverse modes @xmath70 is shown by green hatching between red line and the value 1 . ]",
    "the total vibrational density of states can be decomposed to longitudinal and transverse components @xmath71 where @xmath72 is an eigenfrequency , @xmath73 is the corresponding eigenmode , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are its transverse and longitudinal components defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : prjns ] ) and ( [ eq : prjrs ] ) .",
    "the total vibrational density of states and its longitudinal and transverse components was calculated for the numerical model of a - si consisting of @xmath6 atoms by the kernel polynomial method ( kpm )  @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in the figure  [ fig : doslt ] .",
    "there are three clearly seen regions .",
    "the vibrations are mostly transverse below 7 thz and above 15 thz . in the frequency interval in between the vibrations have the longitudinal nature .",
    "the low number of longitudinal vibrations in the low - frequency region is explained by the debye law , which gives @xmath76 in our model the amorphous si has the longitudinal sound velocity @xmath77 and the transverse sound velocity @xmath78 which gives the ratio @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "this value coincides with the inset in the figure  [ fig : doslt ] .",
    "the domination of the longitudinal modes between 7 thz and 15 thz in amorphous silicon corresponds to the gap between the upper frequency of ta modes ( 7.5 thz ) and the lower frequency of to modes ( 13.9 thz ) in crystalline si  @xcite .",
    "this frequency region in crystalline si is totally occupied by la and lo modes without a gap . in the same frequency region",
    "the vibrations of amorphous si have a small transverse component ( 1520% ) .",
    "certainly , there are no optical phonons with well defined wavevector in amorphous silicon due to relatively strong disorder",
    ". however , the short - range order of vibrational modes in amorphous phase can be similar to that in crystal phase . at the same time , our definition of the longitudinal and transverse vibrations is local because it is based on the voronoi cells , which depends on the neighbor atoms only .",
    "the figure  [ fig : doslt ] shows a sharp change of the nature of vibrations at 7 thz from almost transverse to almost longitudinal .",
    "the longitudinal vibrations correspond to the stretching of the chemical bonds between atoms while the transverse vibrations correspond to the less rigid bond bending and rocking .",
    "therefore longitudinal vibrations can transfer the vibrational energy much faster than transverse vibrations which leads to the sudden rise of the diffusivity at 7 thz observed in refs .",
    "furthermore , our additional calculations show that the longitudinal modes still have a well - defined wavevector and a sound velocity up to @xmath81 thz unlike the transverse modes , which have the frequency of the ioffe - regel crossover @xmath82 thz .",
    "we have shown that vibrations in amorphous solids can be decomposed to transverse and longitudinal components in a generalized sense . the transverse component does not change the volumes of voronoi cells around atoms while the longitudinal component is the remaining orthogonal component changing this volume .",
    "we show that the rise of the diffusivity at 7 thz in amorphous silicon corresponds to the sharp change of the nature of vibrations from almost transverse to almost longitudinal ones having high sound velocity",
    ". this decomposition can be fruitful for the investigation of the correlation function and the diffusivity of transverse and longitudinal components of vibrations in amorphous solids independently from each other .",
    "the 3d - structure of several voronoi cells in amorphous silicon is available online in supplementary materials .",
