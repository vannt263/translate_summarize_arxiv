    "it has been argued that certain physical processes , which may occur as the stars evolve on the main sequence , could cause the observed lithium depletion . among these processes we recall gravitational settling ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) or possible coupling between internal gravity waves and rotation - induced mixing @xcite .    in this paper",

    "on one side , it has been shown that overshoot at the base of the solar convective envelope is more efficient than hitherto believed  @xcite , and could be even more in the envelope of a pms star .",

    "pre - main sequence is the direct continuation of the proto - stellar phase .",
    "initially , as the young stellar object ( yso ) evolves along its stellar birthline , its luminosity is mainly supported by an accretion process strong enough to maintain active deuterium fusion @xcite .",
    "once the accretion ceases , the proto - star , surrounded only by a residual disk , descends along its hayashi line almost vertically in the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( h - r diagram ) , undergoing a rapid gravitational contraction .    in this phase evolution of pms stars",
    "critically depends on their mass , and lithium can be burned at different stages through the reaction @xmath0li(p,@xmath10he .",
    "lithium is very fragile as the nuclear reaction rate @xmath11  of @xmath4li(p,@xmath10he becomes efficient already at temperatures of a few million kelvin . the effective li burning temperature for pms stars , i.e. that needed to consume li in a timescale of @xmath12 , is @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath11  is adopted from jina reaclib database  @xcite .",

    "thereafter , the li evolution is critically affected the temperature at the base of the convective envelope , and the efficiency of overshoot at the base of the convective envelope begins to play a significant role .",

    "overshooting ( ov ) is the signature of the non - local convective mixing in the star that may occur at the borders of any convectively unstable region @xcite .",
    "as already anticipated , efficient overshooting at the base of the convective envelope may significantly affect pms surface li depletion , because overshooting extends the mixed region into the hotter stellar interior .",
    "recently  @xcite suggest that an overshooting region of size @xmath23 ( where @xmath24  is the pressure scale height ) , at the base of the convective envelope of the sun , provides a better agreement with the helioseismology data .",
    "these values are higher than those of earlier studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and indicate that the overshoot mixing could be much more efficient than previously assumed . it should be recalled that by applying an efficient envelope overshoot , many other observational data could be better reproduced , such as the blue loop of intermediate and massive stars  @xcite , the low - mass metal - poor stars  @xcite , the carbon stars luminosity functions in the magellanic clouds via a more efficient third dredge - up in agb stars  @xcite , and the location of the rgb bump in old star clusters  @xcite .",
    "soon after the formation of the radiative core we assume that the overshooting at the base of the deep convective envelope is quite efficient , with  @xmath25 .",
    "this value is intermediate between the one suggested for the sun @xcite and the larger values ( @xmath26 ) suggested by @xcite for intermediate and massive stars",

    "then , as the star moves toward the zero age main sequence ( zams ) , we vary the overshooting efficiency proportionally to the mass size of the outer unstable convective region  ( @xmath31 ) , until the typical value estimated for the sun  @xmath32  @xcite is reached : @xmath33 this assumption produces an efficient photospheric li depletion during the pms phase , while preserving the solar constraints for the main sequence stars . fig .",

    "the stars are initially fully convective and the temperature at the base of the convective zone  ( @xmath35 )  is high enough to burn li so efficiently to begin surface li depletion . as the central region heats up , the base of the convective envelope moves outwards to the stellar surface , while  @xmath35  decreases .",

    "recent observations of late pms stars  those that have already abandoned the stellar birth line and are joining the zams  reveal that most of them show h@xmath40-line emission , which likely originates in a residual accretion process @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the disk accretion may last much longer than previously believed : at least tens of myr and even up to the early main sequence stars @xcite .",

    "since the accreting material keeps the initial li abundance , its contribution can not be neglected , especially if the photospheric value has been already depleted by another process . in this framework",
    "we modify our stellar evolution code ` parsec ` to account for the effect of such a residual accretion during the pms phase .",
    "we assume that , after the main accretion phase when the star leaves the stellar birth - line by consuming its internal deuterium , a residual accretion keeps going on .",
    "since our pms models are initially evolved at constant mass from a contracting configuration without nuclear burning , we assume that the residual accretion begins when deuterium burning ends , that is when the photospheric deuterium abundance drops to 1/10 of its initial value , and indicate this time as @xmath44 .",

    "we note that the duration of the early large accretion , before @xmath44 , is around  @xmath48 yr , hence negligible compared to the pms lifetime ( several  @xmath9  yr ) . as to the initial accretion rate @xmath46 , we assume @xmath49yr , which is a reasonable value close to the observed median accretion rate for young tts @xcite .",

    "late accretion will last until the remaining gas reservoir is consumed or until some feedback mechanism from the star itself is able to clean the nearby disk . in this respect , extremely uv ( euv ) radiation ( @xmath53  ev",

    "the warm gas can escape from the gravitational potential of the central star and flow away in a wind  @xcite .",
    "although no actual evaporative flow observation is available yet , there is a large consensus that this radiation could significantly reduce the disk mass and shorten the lifetime of the disk .",
    "the existence of pre - transitional and transitional disks with a gap or a hole in the disk are taken as possible evidence of this process  @xcite .",

    "thereafter , the star evolves at constant luminosity toward the zams and , since the effective temperature increases , the fractional number of euv photons increases rapidly , so does the evaporation rate .",

    "figure  [ fig : rate ] is meant to provide a schematic diagram of this mechanism for the first 100  myr .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the quenching of accretion is expected to be much more complex than our model description .",
    "for instance , we notice that only a fraction of the total euv photons from the central star could reach the residual disk , if the latter maintains a small geometrical cross section . on the other hand , stellar activity in young star ( e.g. , accretion shock , magnetic field driven chromosphere activities , etc . ) , which is not included in our model , could also be a source of euv photons and contribute to evaporation .",
    "this effect could balance the geometrical loss of euv photons though the relative contribution between the two sources is not clear .",

    "the residual disk masses we are considering for the present work are even more uncertain than those of the main disk . here",

    "the surface convective zone of the stars at the plateau high temperature end ( the relatively more massive stars ) is so thin that , if microscopic diffusion is at work and not balanced by the radiative levitation , a too strong depletion is produced .",
    "for example , according to the model of @xcite we can see that even at @xmath72 k the predicted li depletion is too strong compared to the observed plateau .",

    "is governed by the competition between late accretion , dilution and nuclear burning at the bottom of the convective envelope .",
    "as soon as efficient li burning ceases , accretion begins to restore the surface li abundance . in the more massive stars the convective zone shrinks more rapidly and li restoring is faster .",

    "more massive stars rapidly recover the initial surface li abundance while in lower mass stars this process is slower because nuclear reactions will continue to burn the accreted li and the convective dilution is larger .",

    "more massive stars evolve more rapidly toward the zams and their euv luminosity is able to stop accretion at earlier times , even before the initial abundance is completely restored ( see fig .",

    "where li depletion is more pronounced , the euv evaporation rates are lower and accretion , though decreasing , is still able to drive the surface li abundance toward the initial value , until it is inhibited by evaporation . at even lower masses ( e.g. , @xmath81 ) ,",
    "the recovery of the initial li abundance is delayed or even inhibited by the deep convective zone which is still large when the model reaches the zams . in this case",

    "table  [ tab : tstart ] lists the li number density decrease during pms and ms , the former is much more than , or at least the same as , the latter , especially for the lower masses .",
    "the first part of li declining branch is caused mainly by the pms depletion .",
    "the spite plateau is populated by metal - poor main sequence stars with different metallicities . with the same overshooting and accretion parameters we can indeed reproduce the plateau , including the initial li declining branch , over a wide range of metallicities , ( from z=0.00001 to z=0.0005 , that is from [ m / h]=-3.2 to [ m / h]=-1.5 ) as shown in fig .  [ fig : multi ] .    .",
    "the model results are all main sequence stars at age 10 gyr , with initial mass 0.80 @xmath82 to 0.57 @xmath82 from the left to the right for each metallicity as shown in the color - bar label . ]",
    "in the previous sections we have shown how the effects of efficient envelope overshooting , residual accretion during the pre - main sequence phase , and microscopic diffusion during the main sequence may modify the photospheric li abundance in low - metallicity stars .",
    "we have also considered the euv photo - evaporation process which , by terminating the accretion phase , could introduce a sort of self - regulating process .    in order to give a more exhaustive picture of the importance of the various processes we computed more sets of models under different assumptions concerning the above physical mechanisms .",
    "we synthesize the results of these additional models in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] where we compare the predicted li abundances with the observed ones ( see fig .  [ fig : com ] ) .    * * standard models * + we begin with two sets of models where none of the pms effects have been considered . the first set ( orange dashed line ) is the standard model without microscopic diffusion while , in the second set of model ( green dot - dashed line ) microscopic diffusion is introduced as it is in the standard ` parsec ` model . + the model without diffusion is clearly at variance with the observed data . on the other hand when diffusion is included the li abundance reaches a(li)=2.45  dex , producing a plateau somewhat higher than the observed one , by a factor of 1.6 .",
    "the pure diffusion model of @xcite is also plotted in this figure ( extracted from figure 1 of @xcite with [ fe / h]=-2.6 and age 12 gyr ) .",
    "contrary to them , our diffusive model does not produce the strong downturn at high effective temperatures .",
    "this is due to the inhibition of diffusion in the outer layers of the star which , as discussed in sect .  [ sec : ms ] , is required to prevent a too strong sedimentation of helium and heavy elements at the stellar surface @xcite .",
    "+ while the plateau could eventually be reproduced by increasing the efficiency of diffusion strongly , we note however that , with the adopted diffusion parameters the solar model is very well reproduced @xcite . *",
    "* present models * + the present models , that include pms effects and diffusion ( red solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] ) , provide a good fit to the data .",
    "they reproduce both the observed plateau and the declining branch at low temperatures . as a test",
    ", we recomputed the same models but switching off microscopic diffusion during the main sequence phase ( blue dotted line ) .",
    "these new models are identical in the pms evolution and incorporate the li nuclear burning during main sequence .",
    "the latter is mainly responsible for the behavior of li depletion at low effective temperatures .",
    "they do not reach the plateau value , terminating somewhat at higher li abundances , suggesting that some additional depletion is required .",
    "in our model we do not consider stellar rotation .",
    "the additional effects of rotation on li depletion have been discussed in many works , but mainly in the context of solar - type stars . during the pms",
    ", rotation may affect the internal structure of the stars both because of the presence of the centrifugal force and the effects of rotational mixing at the base of the convective envelope .",
    "@xcite conclude that by including the full treatment of rotation in pms , 0.1 dex more li depletion is obtained . during the evolution on the main sequence ,",
    "rotational mixing tends to oppose to gravitational settling , and this solo effect should decrease the surface elements depletion with respect to non - rotating models . however in the case of li , rotational mixing may be so efficient that li is dragged to encounter temperatures which could efficiently destroy it by nuclear burning .",
    "this is the case of the slow rotator model of m=1.0  @xmath82 of @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that because of the rotation - caused structural difference , stars with faster rotation in open clusters pleiades and @xmath89 persei have higher li abundance than the slower rotaters .",
    "this results is confirmed by pleiades observation of @xcite . in general",
    "it is found that rotation leads to a large spread in the main sequence li abundance of solar - type stars at varying mass @xcite , which could be difficult to reconcile with that observed in the spite plateau of metal - poor stars .",
    "it is important to stress that , as long as the stars are accreting at significant rates , deuterium burning keep their central temperature around 10@xmath90k . during this phase the stars evolve along the birth line increasing their masses ( e.g. reaching 1  m@xmath91  in 0.1 myr for an accretion rate of @xmath92  m@xmath91  /yr as indicated in table  [ tab : tstart ] ) , while preserving the initial li abundance @xcite .",
    "once the accretion rates fall below several @xmath93  m@xmath91  /yr the stars abandon the stellar birth - line and evolve at almost constant mass .",
    "it is from this point that we consider the additional effects of envelope overshooting , which reduces the li abundance , and of accretion , which tends to restore the original abundance .",
    "we have also shown that euv evaporation of material falling into the stars can act as a natural self - regulating mechanism .    in the relatively more massive stars , where the original li abundance could be more quickly restored , euv evaporation is more efficient and quenches out accretion earlier than in lower mass stars , which thus have more time to accrete the pristine gas .",
    "these combined effects tend to level out the li abundance in stars of different masses . at even lower masses , li restoring",
    "is inhibited by nuclear burning in the deep convective envelopes .",
    "after the pms , li is slowly depleted by microscopic diffusion and nuclear burning which act during main sequence phase . for stars with @xmath94",
    "diffusion drives the main li depletion whilst , for @xmath95 stars , li is significant burned at the base of the convective envelope .    in this scenario , the observed spite plateau and",
    "its falling branch at low temperatures are well reproduced by our models , within a reasonable parametrization of the late accretion mechanism .",
    "very efficient overshoot is only applied during the early pms to favour strong li depletion at the beginning of the evolution .",
    "we also find that , even for a maximum envelope overshoot @xmath96 , which is the value calibrated from the rgb bump @xcite , the plateau and its falling branch can be finally well reproduced for the same accretion rate .",
    "this indicates that a wide range of envelope overshoot could be applied to the pms phase . even for @xmath96",
    "the pms li depletion is very strong ; without accretion a very low li abundance would be observed , e.g. for @xmath97 a(li ) drops to 1 dex before li restoring .",
    "it would be important to directly observe whether the very early li depletion phase exists or not , because it could confirm that efficient overshoot is at work .",
    "indeed , at higher metallicities there is evidence of a significant drop of the li abundance during the pms phase @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", the lack of nearby metal - poor star forming regions prevents any observational test at low metallicity . this opportunity will be perhaps offered by the next generation telescopes ( e - elt , tmt , and gmt ) which could observe the details of low mass metal - poor pms stars in star forming regions like those of the sagittarius dwarf irregular galaxy ( metallicity at @xmath98  @xcite ) .    for stars with initial mass @xmath99 , ages in the range 10 - 12 gyr , and a wide range of metallicities ( z=0.00001 to z=0.0005 ) ,",
    "our final model is able to predict a present day abundance consistent with the spite plateau , although starting from an initial value of a(li)=2.72 as inferred from the baryon - to - photon ratio suggested by the cmb and by the deuterium measurements .",
    "thus it offers a likely mechanism to solve the long standing _",
    "lithium problem_. it also reproduces the observed lithium drop at the low - temperatures .",
    "the proposed solution relies on stellar physics and evolution , assuming the validity of the current sbbn theory .",
    "though this model is quite schematic and rough , it clearly suggests that the spite plateau could be the net result of mechanisms more complex than those considered so far . in particular , a key role may be attributed to the interaction between the stars and their environments .    if the lithium abundance we presently observe in pop ii stars has been restored in the stellar atmospheres by a residual tail of accretion after a phase of strong depletion , then other puzzling observations could be explained , namely :    * li at very low metallicities .",
    "+ @xcite  found in their observations that for the extreme metal - poor stars , li abundance drops when [ fe / h]@xmath100 .",
    "@xcite  and  @xcite  observed dwarfs with [ fe / h ] at the lowest levels without any detectable li .",
    "@xcite  detected li in an un - evolved star with [ fe / h]=-4.8 at a level of a(li ) = 1.77 and anther recently discovered extremely metal poor dwarf sdss j1742 + 2531 with [ fe / h ] = -4.8 shows a(li ) @xmath101 1.8  @xcite .",
    "the low li abundance in these stars could be explained by a failed or weaker late accretion . for the most metal - poor stars , late accretion during the pms phase",
    "might be inhibited and li could not be restored . as we have already shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmsov ] ( right panel ) , if no accretion takes place after the initial li is depleted by the convective overshoot , li in these stars would correspond to a very low , or even undetectable , abundance .",
    "thus the model presented here provides a possible key to account for this phenomenon , and we will discuss it in detail in a following paper . * spectroscopic binaries and outliers + our model might also provide an explanation to the li discrepancy observed in metal - poor binary stars .",
    "the pop ii spectroscopic binaries cs 22876 - 032  @xcite and g 166 - 45  @xcite are composed by dwarfs with effective temperatures characteristic of the spite plateau , but with the primary stars showing slightly higher li abundances .",
    "it could simply be an effect of the competition between the components in the late pms accretion , with the primary star being the favorite one .",
    "+ the failure or increase of the accretion process could also provide an explanation for the few pop ii @xmath0li depleted stars or the few pop ii stars that exhibit a @xmath0li abundances at the sbbn prediction level , respectively . among the latter",
    "there is bd + 23 3912 with @xmath102=2.60 which stands out from the others in @xcite . * lithium behavior in pop",
    "i stars + li abundance at the solar system formation time , as obtained from meteorites , is @xmath103(li)@xmath104 @xcite",
    ". the hot f stars of young open clusters never reach this meteoritic value  @xcite despite they should have an initial li value even higher than the meteoritic one due to the galactic li increase with time .",
    "this li drop can not be explained by main sequence li evolution because the stars are very young .",
    "a pms li modification could be the possible mechanism for the depletion .",
    "this will be discussed in detail in a following work dedicated to the metal - rich stars . * low lithium abundance in the planet host stars + @xcite and @xcite present the observational evidence that the solar analogues with planet(s ) show lower lithium abundance than those without detected planets .",
    "to explain this effect @xcite advance the hypothesis that giant exoplanets prefer stars with slow rotation rates on the zams due to their longer disk lifetime during the pms evolution . then their zams models with rotational mixing , which we already discussed in section [ sec : ms ] , would indicate an enhanced lithium depletion , consistent with observations .",
    "again it is worth noting that a strong pms depletion at decreasing mass is predicted by solar metallicity models with rotation @xcite , and it is not yet clear how this could be reconciled with the observations of @xcite and @xcite . in our model , this behavior could be explained if somehow the planet(s ) , located within the accreting disk , interfere with the late accretion process .",
    "the pms accretion could end before being terminated by the euv evaporation , inhibiting efficient lithium restoring .",
    "thus these stars will show lower li abundance than their analogues without detected planets .",
    "this effect could also explain the larger li abundance scatter observed in metal - rich stars , which are more likely to host planets  @xcite , with respect to what observed in metal poor stars .",
