    "high - precision measurements of hadrons and hadron jets have become increasingly important in experimental particle physics .",
    "such measurements are considered a crucial ingredient of experiments at a future high - energy linear electron - positron collider . historically , by far",
    "the best performance in this respect has been delivered by _ compensating _ hadron calorimeters @xcite . in these instruments ,",
    "the response to the electromagnetic ( em ) and non - electromagnetic shower components is equalized by design , and therefore the detrimental effects of event - to - event fluctuations in the energy sharing between these components are eliminated .",
    "these effects include hadronic signal non - linearity , a poor hadronic energy resolution , especially at high energies where deviations from @xmath0 scaling become the dominant factor , and a non - gaussian response function .    in recent years",
    ", an alternative technique has been developed : the dual readout method ( dream ) .",
    "dream calorimeters offer the same advantages as compensating ones , and are not subject to the disadvantages of the latter .",
    "these disadvantages derive from the fact that compensation can only be achieved in sampling calorimeters with a small sampling fraction ( 2.3% in lead / plastic - scintillator ) , plus the fact that compensation relies upon efficient detection of the neutrons produced in the shower development .",
    "these requirements limit the electromagnetic ( em ) energy resolution achievable with these instruments , while the excellent hadronic performance is only achieved with sufficiently large detector volumes and integration times .",
    "dream calorimeters are based on a simultaneous measurement of different types of signals which provide complementary information about details of the shower development .",
    "the first calorimeter of this type that we developed and tested ( in the context of a generic r&d project ) was based on a copper absorber structure , equipped with two types of active media .",
    "scintillating fibers measure the total energy deposited by the shower particles , while erenkov light is only produced by the charged , relativistic shower particles .",
    "since the latter are almost exclusively found in the em shower component ( dominated by @xmath1s produced in hadronic showers ) , a comparison of the two signals makes it possible to measure the energy fraction carried by this component , @xmath2 , event by event . as a result , the effects of fluctuations in this component , which are responsible for all traditional problems in non - compensating calorimeters , can be eliminated .",
    "this leads to an important improvement in the hadronic calorimeter performance .",
    "the performance characteristics of this detector are described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "once the effects of the dominant source of fluctuations , fluctuations in the em energy fraction @xmath2 , are eliminated , the performance characteristics are determined ( and limited ) by other types of fluctuations . in the described detector ,",
    "a prominent role was played by the small number of erenkov photoelectrons constituting the signals ( 8 p.e./gev ) .",
    "however , there is absolutely no reason why the dream principle would only work in fiber calorimeters , or even in sampling calorimeters for that matter .",
    "one could in principle even use a homogeneous ( fully sensitive ) detector , provided that the light signals can be separated into scintillation and erenkov components . in this paper",
    ", we describe the results of tests of this idea .",
    "a small electromagnetic calorimeter made of lead tungstate ( pbwo@xmath3 ) crystals was tested in conjunction with the dream calorimeter mentioned above , and exposed to high - energy particle beams at cern s super proton synchrotron .    in section 2 , we describe the detectors and the experimental setup in which they were tested . in section 3 , we discuss the experimental data that were taken and the methods used to analyze these data . in section 4 , the experimental results are described and discussed . a summary and conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "the calorimeter system used in these experiments comprised two sections.the electromagnetic section ( ecal ) consisted of 19 lead tungstate ( pbwo@xmath3 ) crystals .",
    "each crystal was 18 cm long , with a cross section of @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "these crystals were arranged in a matrix , as shown in figure [ ecal ] .    for the purpose of these tests , this ensemble of crystals",
    "was considered one unit .",
    "the crystals were not optically isolated from each other , and the light produced by showering particles was read out by only two photomultiplier tubes ( pmt ) , one located at each end of the crystal matrix .",
    "the light was funneled into these tubes by means of cones made of aluminized mylar , a highly reflective material .    for the hadronic section ( hcal ) of the calorimeter system",
    ", we used the original dream calorimeter @xcite .",
    "the basic element of this detector is an extruded copper rod , 2 meters long and 4@xmath6 4 mm@xmath7 in cross section .",
    "this rod is hollow , and the central cylinder has a diameter of 2.5 mm .",
    "seven optical fibers were inserted in this hole .",
    "three of these were plastic scintillating fibers , the other four fibers were undoped fibers , intended for detecting erenkov light .",
    "the instrumented volume had a length of 2.0 m ( 10 @xmath8 , 100 @xmath9 ) , an effective radius of 16.2 cm and a mass of 1030 kg .",
    "the fibers were grouped to form 19 hexagonal towers .",
    "the effective radius of each tower was 37.1 mm ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "a central tower ( # 1 ) was surrounded by two hexagonal rings , the inner ring ( 6 towers , numbered 2 - 7 ) and the outer ring ( 12 towers , numbered 8 - 19 ) .",
    "the towers were longitudinally unsegmented .",
    "the fibers sticking out at the rear end of this structure were separated into 38 bunches : 19 bunches of scintillating fibers and 19 bunches of erenkov fibers . in this way , the readout structure was established .",
    "each bunch was coupled through a 2 mm air gap to a pmt .",
    "more information about this detector is given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the measurements described in this paper were performed in the h4 beam line of the super proton synchrotron at cern .",
    "the detectors were mounted on a platform that could move vertically and sideways with respect to the beam .",
    "the ecal was rotated into different positions ( see section 4 ) by hand .",
    "two small scintillation counters provided the signals that were used to trigger the data acquisition system .",
    "these trigger counters were 2.5 mm thick , and the area of overlap was 6@xmath66 @xmath5 .",
    "a coincidence between the logic signals from these counters provided the trigger .",
    "measurement of the time structure of the calorimeter signals formed a very important part of the tests described here . in order to limit distortion of this structure as much as possible , we used 15 mm thick air - core cables to transport the ecal signals to the counting room .",
    "such cables were also used for the signals from the trigger counters , and these were routed such as to minimize delays in the daq system in these cables . ] .",
    "the hcal signals were transported through rg-58 cables with ( for timing purposes ) appropriate lengths to the counting room .",
    "the ecal signals were split ( passively ) into 5 equal parts in the counting room .",
    "one part was sent to a charge adc , the other 4 signals were used for analysis of the time structure by means of a fadc .",
    "the latter unit measured the amplitude of the signals at a rate of 200 mhz . during a time interval of 80 ns",
    ", 16 measurements of the amplitude were thus obtained .",
    "the 4 signals from the splitter box were measured separately in 4 different channels of the fadc module .",
    "signals 2 , 3 and 4 were delayed by 1.25 ns , 2.50 ns and 3.75 ns with respect to signal 1 . by using 4 channels of the fadc module in this way , the time structure of the signals was thus effectively measured with a resolution of 1.25 ns ( 800 mhz ) .    the quality of the information obtained in this way is illustrated in figure [ esignal ] , which shows the average time structure of the signals from 50 gev electron showers developing in the lead tungstate ecal .",
    "the trailing edge of these signals is well described by an exponential decay with a time constant of 9.7 ns .",
    "the charge measurements were performed with 12-bit lecroy 1182 adcs . these had a sensitivity of 50 fc / count and a conversion time of 16 @xmath11s .",
    "the adc gate width was 100 ns , and the calorimeter signals arrived @xmath12 ns after the start of the gate .",
    "the data acquisition system used vme electronics .",
    "a single vme crate hosted all the needed readout and control boards .",
    "the trigger logic was implemented through nim modules and the signals were sent to a vme i / o register , which also collected the spill and the global busy information .",
    "the vme crate was linked to a linux based computer through an sbs 620 optical vme - pci interface that allowed memory mapping of the vme resources via an open source driversanshiro / kinoko - e / vmedrv/ ] .",
    "the computer was equipped with a 2 ghz pentium-4 cpu , 1 gb of ram , and was running a cern slc 4.3 operating system .",
    "the data acquisition was based on a single - event polling mechanism and performed by a pair of independent programs that communicated through a first - in - first - out buffer , built on top of a 32 mb shared memory .",
    "only exclusive accesses were allowed and concurrent requests were synchronised with semaphores .",
    "the chosen scheme optimized the cpu utilization and increased the data taking efficiency by exploiting the bunch structure of the sps , where beam particles were provided to our experiment during a spill of 4.8 s , out of a total cycle time of 16.8 s. during the spill , the readout program collected data from the vme modules and stored them into the shared memory , with small access times . during the remainder of the sps cycle , a recorder program dumped the events to the disk .",
    "moreover , the buffer presence allowed low - priority monitoring programs to run ( off - spill ) in spy mode . with this scheme , we were able to reach a data acquisition rate as high as 2 khz , limited by the fadc readout time .",
    "the typical event size was @xmath13 kb . all calorimeter signals and the signals from the auxiliary detectors were monitored on - line .",
    "the two pmts reading out the two sides of the ecal were calibrated with 50 gev electrons . to this end ,",
    "the ecal was oriented such that the beam entered the detector perpendicular to the crystal axis , and the two pmts collecting the light generated by the showers were located in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis ( figure [ setup1 ] ) .",
    "= 5.5 cm    the main purpose of this setup was to equalize the gain of the two pmts in a geometry where the relative contributions of scintillation and erenkov light to the signals were the same for both . given the radiation length of pbwo@xmath3 ( 8.9 mm ) , the ecal was only @xmath14 deep in this geometry , and therefore , a substantial fraction of the shower energy leaked out .",
    "the energy equivalent of the signals thus had to be established on the basis of ( egs4 ) monte carlo simulations .",
    "the 38 pmts reading out the 19 towers of the hcal were also all calibrated with 50 gev electrons .",
    "the showers generated by these particles were not completely contained in a single calorimeter tower .",
    "the ( average ) containment was found from egs4 monte carlo simulations . when the electrons entered a tower in its geometrical center , on average @xmath15 of the scintillation light and @xmath16 of the erenkov light was generated in that tower @xcite .",
    "the remaining fraction of the light was shared by the surrounding towers .",
    "the signals observed in the exposed tower thus corresponded to an energy deposit of 46.3 gev in the case of the scintillating fibers and of 46.8 gev for the erenkov fibers .",
    "this , together with the precisely measured values of the average signals from the exposed tower , formed the basis for determining the calibration constants , the relationship between the measured number of adc counts and the corresponding energy deposit .",
    "the main purpose of these tests was to see if the ecal signals could be split into their scintillation and erenkov components . in order to optimize the possibilities in this respect ,",
    "the ecal was oriented such that the angle between the crystal axis and the beam axis was equal to the erenkov angle , @xmath17 : @xmath18 since the refractive index of pbwo@xmath3 is 2.2 , @xmath19 . detailed measurements of the angular dependence of the erenkov / scintillation ratio @xcite revealed indeed a maximum value near @xmath20 , and therefore we chose this angle for our tests .",
    "the detector setup is shown in figure [ setup2 ] . in this geometry ,",
    "the effective depth of the ecal amounted to @xmath21 , and it contained on average @xmath22 of 50 gev electron showers .",
    "the remaining 10% of the shower energy was recorded in the hcal .",
    "= 5.5 cm    we exposed the calorimeter system to 50 gev electrons and to 50 and 100 gev @xmath23 . for each run,100 000 events were collected .",
    "the time structure of both ecal signals was measured with 1.25 ns resolution . the integrated charge carried by these signals and by those from the 38 hcal channels",
    "was digitized with 12 bit resolution .",
    "the beams turned out to be very clean .",
    "contamination in the electron beam was less than 10@xmath24 .",
    "the pion beams contained muons , at the few-% level .",
    "these muons could be easily recognized and removed from the event samples .",
    "we used the muon events for separate studies .",
    "in lead tungstate , erenkov light is emitted at an angle of @xmath25 by charged shower particles that are sufficiently relativistic .",
    "unlike the scintillation light , which is isotropically emitted , there is a clear directional preference in the erenkov light production of high - energy showers .",
    "even though much of the shower energy is deposited by isotropically distributed electrons , produced in compton scattering and photoelectric processes , the effects of that on the angular distribution of the emitted erenkov light are limited , since much of this takes place below the erenkov threshold ( @xmath26 mev/@xmath27 ) .",
    "quantitative information on this was obtained from the angular dependence of the response of quartz - fiber calorimeters ( which are exclusively detecting erenkov light ) to high - energy electron showers @xcite .",
    "the maximum response was obtained when the fibers were oriented at the erenkov angle with respect to the shower axis .",
    "this response was reduced by a factor 2 - 3 when the fibers were aligned with the beam axis , and by a factor 10 when read out at the upstream end .",
    "we are exploiting this feature by comparing the signals from the two ecal channels in the @xmath25 geometry ( figure [ setup2 ] ) .",
    "any erenkov light produced in the shower development will be preferentially observed in the downstream channel ( to be named channel @xmath28 in the following ) , whereas the upstream channel ( channel @xmath29 ) will see a much smaller fraction of it . since both pmts see the same amount of scintillation light , the _ forward / backward asymmetry _ ,",
    "@xmath30 , is a measure for the fraction of erenkov light contained in the signals .",
    "= 6.6 cm    figure [ asym_e]a shows the measured asymmetry for the 50 gev electron signals from the ecal .",
    "indeed , the @xmath28 signals are significantly larger than the @xmath29 ones , on average by @xmath31 .",
    "the forward / backward asymmetry was measured to be @xmath32 .",
    "forward / backward asymmetry was also observed in the ecal signals from pions and muons .",
    "the muon asymmetry is shown in figure [ asym_e]b .",
    "the asymmetry is larger than for electron showers , the @xmath28 signals were measured to be , on average , larger by @xmath33 than the @xmath29 ones ( the forward / backward asymmetry was measured to be @xmath34 ) .",
    "however , the event - to - event fluctuations are considerably larger .",
    "the @xmath35 of the distribution for muons is larger by a factor 35 - 40 than the width of the distribution for electron showers .",
    "the latter phenomenon is due to the fact that the electron signals are considerably larger ( 45 gev vs 0.1 gev for a mip ) , so that poisson fluctuations in the number of photoelectrons account for at least half of this differenceb gave a @xmath36 of 0.60 .",
    "if ( poisson ) photoelectron statistics was the only contributing factor to the width , one should expect a sigma of 0.46 . ] .",
    "in addition , because of the landau distribution of the muon signals , these statistical fluctuations are non - poissonian for these particles .",
    "the larger average asymmetry for muons should be expected on the basis of the fact that erenkov light generated in em showers contains an isotropic component , mainly produced by compton electrons @xcite . in a separate paper , we have shown that measurements of em showers in thin pbwo@xmath3 crystals revealed that the forward / backward asymmetry decreases as the em shower develops . in the first @xmath37 ,",
    "an asymmetry of @xmath38 was measured , but this asymmetry decreased considerably when deeper regions of the shower were probed .",
    "the asymmetries measured here for complete em showers and for single particles ( muons ) are in complete agreement with these observations .",
    "= 9.5 cm    after removing the ( 6% ) muons from the 50 gev hadronic event sample , the remaining pion events exhibited some interesting characteristics , which are a direct consequence of the large @xmath39 ratio of the pbwo@xmath3 crystal calorimeter value was measured to be 2.4 @xcite . ] .",
    "figures [ pions]a and [ pions]b show the total signal distributions in the hcal and ecal , respectively .",
    "the hcal distributions exhibits a structure that is the sum of two distinct substructures , as illustrated in figures [ pions]c and [ pions]d .",
    "figure [ pions]c shows the hcal distribution for pions that penetrated the ecal .",
    "these events populate the mip peak in the ecal distribution .",
    "the fact that these pions represent 40% of the total means that the ecal s thickness in this geometry corresponded to @xmath40 nuclear interaction lengths .",
    "the pion events were subdivided into samples depending on the total signal produced in the ecal .",
    "the underlying idea is that the relatively thin ecal will , for all practical purposes , only contain the remnants of the first generation of nuclear reactions in the hadronic shower development .",
    "if the first interaction took place in the first two crystals of the ecal , then @xmath1s produced in this first interaction typically deposited most of their energy in the ecal .",
    "therefore , one should expect a correlation between the total ecal signal and the fraction of erenkov light .",
    "figure [ asymmetry ] clearly exhibits such a correlation . by comparing the results shown in figures [ asym_e]a and [ asymmetry ]",
    ", the average fraction of the ecal signal carried by em shower components may be determined .",
    "however , this determination is complicated by another effect shown in figure [ asymmetry ] , namely the landau tail of pions penetrating the ecal .",
    "not surprisingly , the events in the mip peak of the pion distribution exhibit the same asymmetry as the muons from our sample : @xmath41 , where the smaller error reflects the difference in event statistics . however , event samples with signals larger than the mip peak in the ecal do contain some fraction of penetrating pions , from the landau tail .",
    "because of the much larger asymmetry for such events , the overall asymmetry for these event samples is measurably affected .",
    "a similar effect may be expected for events in which the first pion interaction occurred deep inside the ecal .",
    "measurements with a single crystal indicated that em showers developing only over a few radiation lengths exhibit an asymmetry of @xmath38 , not much smaller than that for mips @xcite .    as a result of these complications ,",
    "the measured asymmetry starts to reflect the em component of the hadron showers only for events in which at least 10 gev ( 20% of the total energy ) was deposited in the ecal .    in order to check the latter statement ,",
    "we investigated the relationship between the erenkov components of the signals observed in the em and hadronic sections of our calorimeter system . in order to limit the contaminating effects of the penetrating pions , we limited this study to pions that deposited more than 10 gev in the ecal .",
    "the relative contribution of erenkov light to the signals was derived from the @xmath30 asymmetry in the ecal and from the @xmath42 signal ratio in the dream hadronic section .",
    "figure [ ehccorr ] shows that there is a clear correlation between these quantities . and",
    "since the @xmath42 signal ratio is directly related to the em shower fraction , @xmath2 , we conclude from this that the asymmetry measured in the ecal is indeed an indicator for the fraction of the ecal signal carried by the em shower component .",
    "this can also be seen as follows .",
    "if we denote the ecal erenkov signal by @xmath43 and the scintillation signal by @xmath44 , as in the dream hadronic section , then the forward / backward asymmetry in the ecal signals can be written as @xmath45 since in practice @xmath46 , the asymmetry is approximately equal to 0.5 @xmath42 , and therefore the asymmetry is related in a similar way to @xmath2 as the @xmath42 signal ratio measured for the dream hadronic section . in reference",
    "@xcite , we derived the exact relationship between @xmath42 and @xmath2 for dream : @xmath47 where the factors 0.21 and 0.76 are the inverse values of the @xmath39 ratios of the cu / quartz and cu / plastic - scintillator sampling structures , respectively .",
    "a similar relationship can be derived between the forward / backward signal asymmetry and the em shower fraction in ecal .",
    "two modifications of equation [ eq2 ] are important :    1 .",
    "the @xmath39 value of ecal as a scintillation device is much larger than for the cu / plastic sampling structure in dream : 2.4 1.3 2 .",
    "since the scintillation and erenkov signals of the ecal are not independently calibrated , as in dream , an overall calibration factor is needed that relates the strengths of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 signals in ecal .",
    "this factor is such that the asymmetry is 0.044 for @xmath48 ( pure em showers , see figure [ asym_e ] ) .",
    "these considerations lead to the following relationship between the measured forward / backward asymmetry in the ecal signals ( with the detector oriented at the erenkov angle ) and the em fraction of the shower energy deposited in this calorimeter section : @xmath49 this relationship is graphically shown in figure [ fem_bf ] .",
    "the same figure also shows ( on the top horizontal axis ) the @xmath42 ratio in the fiber calorimeter section .",
    "if the experimental data points were located on this curve , we would conclude that the em shower fraction derived from the em and hadronic signal characteristics was _ exactly _ the same .",
    "however , since the crystal and the fiber sections of the calorimeter system probed different parts of the shower development , and especially since the crystal section only probed the first 0.5 nuclear interaction lengths , such a perfect one - to - one correspondence should not be expected .",
    "however , figure [ fem_bf ] does show a clear correlation between the em shower fractions derived from both detector segments .",
    "the practical merits of all this were studied by investigating the relationship between the asymmetry in the ecal signals and the _ total _ response of the calorimeter system ( ecal + hcal ) , for this event sample .",
    "we recall that in dream , there is a direct relationship between the @xmath42 signal ratio , the ratio of the total signals measured in the erenkov fibers and the scintillation fibers , and the em shower fraction , @xmath2 @xcite . by selecting events with a certain @xmath42 value ,",
    "the @xmath2 value is fixed .",
    "the total calorimeter signal for these events is different from that for events with a different @xmath42 , and thus @xmath2 value .",
    "= 9.5 cm    this is illustrated in figure [ proof ] , which shows in diagram @xmath50 two signal distributions for event samples with very different @xmath42 values .",
    "the @xmath42 bins used for these samples are shown in figure [ proof]a .",
    "the events selected for this purpose all concern pions that penetrated the ecal without a nuclear interaction .",
    "therefore , almost all the energy carried by these pions was deposited in the fiber calorimeter section .",
    "these results illustrate that a larger em shower fraction ( selected by means of the @xmath42 signal ratio ) leads to a considerably larger total calorimeter signal , especially in the extremely non - compensating copper / quartz - fiber structure ( @xmath51 ) used for this purpose .    in figure [ proof]d ,",
    "two signal distributions are shown for events that were selected on the basis of the forward / backward asymmetry measured in the ecal crystal section .",
    "the @xmath30 bins used for these two samples are shown in figure [ proof]c .",
    "only events in which the pions deposited at least 10 gev in the crystal were used for this purpose , and the total signal was calculated as the sum of the signal measured in pmt @xmath28 and the signal from the scintillating fibers in the hadronic section .",
    "these results exhibit , at least qualitatively , the same characteristics as those shown above for the penetrating pions , where the @xmath42 ratio provided information on @xmath2 : the larger the asymmetry measured in the ecal signal , the larger the relative contribution of erenkov light to the ecal signals , the larger the em shower fraction , and thus the larger the total calorimeter signal becomes .    in figure [ dreamtrick ] ,",
    "the described phenomena are shown for the entire range of possible @xmath2 values .",
    "the total calorimeter signal for penetrating events ( mip in ecal ) is plotted as a function of the @xmath42 value in figure [ dreamtrick]a , and in figure [ dreamtrick]b as a function of the @xmath30 value for pions interacting in the ecal ( and depositing more than 10 gev in the crystals ) .",
    "a few remarks are in order .",
    "the fact that the effect shown in figure [ dreamtrick]a ( which we will call the _ reference effect _ ) is much larger than that in figure [ dreamtrick]b can be ascribed to two factors :    1 .",
    "the reference effect concerns exclusively erenkov light .",
    "we are looking at the total erenkov signal as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "had we chosen the signals from the scintillating fibers instead , the observed increase in the calorimeter response would have been only 15% , instead of the factor of two measured for the erenkov reponse @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the very large difference between the @xmath39 values ( 4.7 1.3 ) , which forms the very basis of the dream principle @xcite . for the em content",
    "derived on the basis of the forward / backward asymmetry in the crystal signals , we do nt have the option to look exclusively at erenkov light .",
    "a very large fraction of the signal from the crystals consists of scintillation light , even if we optimize the event selection for em shower content , erenkov contributions .",
    "the ecal is only @xmath52 deep .",
    "even though much of the em component of hadron showers derives from @xmath1 production in the first nuclear interaction of the showering particle , the measurement of @xmath2 for the entire shower on the basis of the signals from the first @xmath52 has its limitations .    in light of these considerations , the effect observed in figure [ dreamtrick]b is actually quite remarkable , although it should also be pointed out that , since the @xmath39 value of a homogeneous pbwo@xmath3 calorimeter is @xmath53 , a larger increase than the 15% mentioned above should be expected for the combination considered here .",
    "figure [ linearity ] summarizes the non - linearity characteristics for the different signals and signal combinations .",
    "we also want to point to another difference between the data sets shown in figures [ dreamtrick]a and [ dreamtrick]b . as explained in reference @xcite ,",
    "there is a linear relationship between @xmath2 and the total calorimeter signal .",
    "even though the parameters @xmath42 and@xmath30 are not exactly proportional to @xmath2 , it is remarkable that the signal dependence for @xmath42 is approximately linear , while it is not for @xmath30 .",
    "this may be explained from the fact that the latter curve extends beyond the physically meaningful region , @xmath54 , contrary to the @xmath42 curve .",
    "this region is limited to @xmath55 , and the points outside this region probe the tails of the distribution .",
    "this may explain the ",
    "s- shaped \" curve of figure [ dreamtrick]b . a similar deviation from linearity",
    "is actually also observed if points covering the unphysical region @xmath56 are included in figure [ dreamtrick]a .",
    "a second valuable tool for recognizing the contributions of erenkov light to the calorimeter signals is derived from the time structure of the events .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fbtime ] , which shows the average time structure of the 50 gev shower signals recorded with the same pmt ( b ) in the two geometries shown in figures [ setup1 ] and [ setup2 ] .",
    "the two distributions have been normalized on the basis of their trailing edge ( 24 - 80 ns after the start of the fadc digitization ) , and are indeed in great detail identical in that domain , both for the electron ( figure [ fbtime]c ) and for the pion ( figure [ fbtime]d ) signals .",
    "this part of the pulses is completely determined by the decay characteristics of the scintillation processes in the pbwo@xmath3 crystals ( see also figure [ esignal ] ) and should thus be independent of the detector orientation .",
    "however , there is a very significant difference in the _ leading _ edge of the pulses .",
    "the ones measured in the 63@xmath57 geometry ( figure [ setup2 ] ) exhibit a steeper rise than the ones from the calibration geometry ( figure [ setup1 ] ) . figures [ fbtime]a and b show the result of subtracting the latter pulse shape from the `` 63@xmath57 '' one : the pulses recorded in the 63@xmath57 geometry contain an additional `` prompt '' component of the type one would expect from erenkov light . in the case of the electron showers , this additional component represents @xmath58 of the total signal . for comparison , we recall that the forward / backward asymmetry measurements led us to conclude that the signals from pmt b contained , on average , 9% of erenkov light .",
    "the pion signals also exhibit a prompt component , which represents a somewhat smaller fraction of the total signal than in the case of the electrons .",
    "we have studied the possible application of differences in the time structure of the calorimeter signals to determine the erenkov component of the light produced in the crystal calorimeter , in a similar way as we used the measured measured forward / backward asymmetry ( section 4.1 ) .",
    "to this end , we used the time at which the calorimeter signal reached half of its amplitude value . the larger the relative contribution of erenkov light ,",
    "the earlier this threshold was reached .",
    "since the contribution of erenkov light to the signals from the downstream pmt ( b ) was larger than that from the upstream pmt ( a ) , we should thus expect the _ difference _ between the times at which the two signals reach 50% of their amplitude level ( @xmath59 ) , to be a measure for the fraction of erenkov light in the signals from the crystal calorimeter .",
    "figure [ tatb ] shows this difference , for 50 gev @xmath23 showers , as a function of the fraction of erenkov light , derived from the @xmath42 signal ratio measured in the fiber section of the calorimeter .",
    "the time difference @xmath59 increases indeed with this fraction . in order to check the significance of this result",
    ", we also repeated this analysis for the measurements done with the same particles ( 50 gev @xmath23 ) in the calibration geometry ( figure [ setup1 ] ) .",
    "the results , shown as squares in figure [ tatb ] , indicate no significant dependence on the erenkov fraction in the latter ( 90@xmath57 ) setup .    as in the case of the forward / backward asymmetry ,",
    "only events depositing at least 10 gev in the crystal calorimeter section were considered in these analyses , and therefore the results from figures [ tatb ] and [ ehccorr ] may be directly compared to each other .",
    "we have also studied the correlation between this time difference and the total calorimeter signals .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ dreamtrick2]a , which shows the sum of the signals from ecal @xmath28 and the hcal scintillating fibers , as a function of @xmath59 , for 50 gev @xmath23 showers that deposited at least 10 gev in the ecal ( early starters ) .",
    "figure [ dreamtrick2]b shows these total signal distributions for two subsets of events , selected on the basis of the time difference @xmath59 .",
    "these results may be directly compared with those depicted in figures [ dreamtrick]b and [ proof]d , which concern a similar analysis on the basis of the forward / backward asymmetry .",
    "we conclude that the time structure of the crystal signals offers equally valuable opportunities for unraveling the crystal signals into their scintillation and erenkov components , and thus of an event - by - event measurement of @xmath2 as the directionality of the light production .",
    "we have measured the contribution of erenkov light to the signals from electrons , muons and hadrons in an electromagnetic calorimeter made of lead tungstate crystals . in the chosen geometry ,",
    "which was optimized for detecting this component , information about this contribution was obtained from the forward / backward asymmetry in the signals and from their time structure .",
    "for single particles traversing the calorimeter ( muons , pions ) , the erenkov contribution was measured to be @xmath33 .",
    "the measurements for showers indicated contributions at about half that level , since a substantial fraction of the signal is in that case typically caused by isotropically distributed shower particles .",
    "the pion measurements made it possible to determine the electromagnetic content of the energy deposited in the crystal calorimeter event by event .",
    "this information was found to correlate well with explicit measurements of this fraction in the dual - readout calorimeter that served as the hadronic section in these measurements .",
    "it could also be used in the same way to determine the electromagnetic shower fraction and thus improve the hadronic calorimeter performance .",
    "both the forward / backward asymmetry between the signals from the pmts reading out both ends of the crystal , and the differences in the time structure of these two signals could be used for this purpose .",
    "the studies reported in this paper were carried out with pbwo@xmath3 crystals made available by the phos group of the alice collaboration .",
    "we sincerely thank drs .",
    "mikhail ippolitov and hans muller for their help and generosity in this context .",
    "we thank cern for making particle beams of excellent quality available .",
