    "ultimately , we can reasonably claim that the shallower slope of its spectrum for @xmath72 is of physical nature , while its behavior at smaller scales is most likely not . on the contrary",

    "a detailed description and discussion about different sources of numerical noise , e.g. the finite number of ppc , will be given in a companion paper @xcite .",
    "for the purpose of this letter , what matters is that such numerical noise does not affect either the qualitative scaling of the electric field spectrum for @xmath73 or the estimate of the spectral indices of other fields up to @xmath74 ( except the velocity field which is presumably affected by the noise level at @xmath75 ) .     at @xmath50 . ]",
    "the transition from the mhd regime to the sub - proton regime is not only characterized by a change in the spectral indices , but also by an increase of energy of the parallel magnetic field and the density fluctuations relative to other fields .",
    "these are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] , along with the parallel and the perpendicular electric field spectrum .",
    "the density and parallel magnetic fluctuations are coupled in the whole range of scales . in the mhd range",
    ", they have a flat spectrum that is an order of magnitude smaller than the perpendicular electric field .",
    "this also results in a small power in the spectrum of the total magnetic field intensity @xmath76 ( not shown ) , consistently with solar wind observations @xcite . in the sub - proton range ,",
    "@xmath77 and @xmath78 steepen , both having a clear power - law scaling with index @xmath11 . by comparing figures  [ fig3]-[fig4 ]",
    "one can see that the parallel and perpendicular components of magnetic fluctuations become comparable at the sub - proton scales , leading also to @xmath79 .",
    "concerning the electric field spectrum , at all scales the perpendicular component @xmath80 dominates by a factor @xmath81 the parallel component @xmath82 , reflecting the fact that in our configuration the leading terms of the generalized ohm s law are linear and quadratic in the fluctuations amplitude for @xmath80 and @xmath82 respectively .",
    "note that @xmath80 flattens at the sub - proton scales and @xmath82 steepens in qualitative agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "it is hard to determine the spectral index of @xmath80 at sub - proton scales ; a rough estimate gives @xmath83 , consistent with @xmath40 being determined by the hall and pressure terms .",
    "in fact , retaining only the leading order in the expression of @xmath40 one gets @xmath84 .",
    "we can further compare our results with observations considering three non - dimensional ratios involving density , magnetic and electric field fluctuations shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "consider first the magnetic compressibility , the ratio of parallel to total magnetic fluctuations ( red line ) .",
    "it is negligible in the mhd range , increases while approaching the sub - proton scales , and finally saturates to a level @xmath85 .",
    "thus , magnetic fluctuations have mainly perpendicular components in the mhd range but tend to become isotropic at small scales , approaching a value @xmath86 , which is within the range ( @xmath87 ) measured in the solar wind at spacecraft frequencies larger then @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this is also in very good agreement with the level of magnetic compressibility expected for kinetic alfvn wave turbulence for the parameters adopted in our simulation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the purple line in figure  [ fig5 ] shows the ratio of normalized density fluctuations over normalized perpendicular magnetic fluctuations , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively , and @xmath91 ( @xmath92 in our simulation ) is a non - dimensional kinetic normalization that depends on @xmath93 @xcite . with this normalization @xmath94 and",
    "@xmath95 are expected to have the same amplitude for kinetic alfvnic fluctuations . indeed @xmath88 increases and then saturates at a value @xmath96 at sub - proton scales .",
    "note that the plateau and its value @xmath97 are consistent with observations ( on average @xmath98 , cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "finally , we plot the ratio between the perpendicular electric fluctuations ( normalized by the alfvn speed ) and the perpendicular magnetic fluctuations ( green line ) . similarly to the observed frequency spectra in the solar wind frame @xcite , this ratio is about @xmath99 in the mhd range , where the mhd term ( @xmath100 ) dominate . at @xmath101",

    "in this letter we show that hybrid 2d large - scale , high - resolution simulations of turbulence are able to reproduce _ simultaneously _ several aspects of the mhd range and of the sub - proton range of solar wind spectra .",
    "two noticeable examples are given by the spectra of the magnetic field and of the electric field .",
    "the former displays a clear double power - law scaling , with spectral indices @xmath102 and @xmath103 in the mhd and sub - proton range respectively , separated by a smooth break at @xmath104 .",
    "the electric field spectrum also shows a change in the spectral properties at about the same scales , being coupled to velocity fluctuations in the mhd range , and becomes shallower at sub - proton scale .",
    "it is also worth noting that in the mhd range we found the scaling observed in the solar wind for the magnetic , kinetic , and residual energy spectra ( respectively @xmath105 , and @xmath5 ) . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first time that these spectral indices are obtained for turbulence with vanishing correlation between magnetic and velocity fields .",
    "dns of incompressible mhd usually capture only the scaling of the residual energy and the total energy @xcite while reduced mhd fails in reproducing velocity and kinetic spectral indices @xcite or requires special driving @xcite",
    ". this may indicate that it is necessary to go beyond the incompressible mhd approximation even in the inertial range .",
    "further work is needed to test this possibility , extending the analysis to a full 3d simulation .    in the sub - proton scales we found an increase in magnetic compressibility and a strong coupling between density and the parallel component of magnetic fluctuations - both having the same spectral index of @xmath11 - with the main cascade of @xmath106 driven from the mhd scales .",
    "all these spectral indices match or are consistent with observations .",
    "the only relevant discrepancies are the flat spectra ( slope @xmath107 ) of parallel magnetic fluctuations and density fluctuations in the mhd range . in the solar wind",
    "they have a spectral index @xmath102 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this aspect is not fully captured by our simulations probably because of the limited compressibility imposed by the 2d dynamics and/or by the value of the proton @xmath108 .",
    "note however that this does not prevent the full development of a compressible cascade at kinetic scales , in good agreement with observations .",
    "properties shown in figure  [ fig5 ] are consistent with the turbulence at sub - proton scales being ruled by fluctuations with properties of kinetic alfvn waves .",
    "however , note that the level of magnetic and gas compressibility expected for this regime follows from more general properties of the thermodynamical state assumed for the plasma ( @xmath109 , @xmath110 and ion - electron temperature ratio ) , which govern the couplings between the different fields @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath25 via the generalized ohm s law . in the low - frequency regime ( i.e. below the whistler range ) , the ratios @xmath113 ,  @xmath114 are not expected to depend on @xmath115 @xcite since they do not rely on the specific dispersion relation of the fluctuations . in this sense ,",
    "the plateaus at @xmath116 in figure  [ fig5 ] represent a more general and likely universal manifestation of low - frequency turbulence at kinetic scale , and this is how we intend to present them here .    as a concluding remark",
    ", we stress that our simulation implements a finite resistivity to assure a source of damping at small scales for the magnetic fluctuations , and thus to prevent energy accumulation and the consequent artificial flattening of the spectrum .",
    "although a more detailed and quantitative analysis of the related effects will be given in a forthcoming paper @xcite , we anticipate that the values of resistivity and the number of ppc affect the ion heating properties",
