    "the reshetikhin turaev invariant is trivial at this quantum group and root of unity .",
    "the hennings invariant distinguishes all the lens spaces @xmath2 from one another at this root of unity .",
    "this proves that there is non - trivial topological information in the non - semisimplicity of @xmath0 .",
    "this non - triviality result has also been obtained by ohtsuki @xcite .",

    "in particular , the method we use to write link invariants directly in relation to a hopf algebra is an analog of the construction in @xcite and it is a generalization of the formalism of @xcite and @xcite .",

    "each morphism in the tangle category consists in a link diagram with free ends which is transverse with respect to a given direction in the plane .",
    "( this special direction will be called the _ vertical _ direction . )",
    "the transversality of the diagram to this vertical direction means that any given line perpendicular to the vertical direction intersects the diagram either tangentially at a maximum or a minimum , at non - zero angle for any other strand .",
    "we shall further assume that any given perpendicular intersects the diagram at most at one crossing . with these stipulations",
    "the free ends of the diagram occur at either its top or its bottom ( top and bottom taken with respect to the designated vertical direction).we shall assume that all the top ends occur along the same perpendicular , and that all the bottom ends occur along another perpendicular to the vertical .",
