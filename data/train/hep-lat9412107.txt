    "it is one of the most important subjects to understand mechanism of color confinement in qcd .",
    "the abelian projection of qcd is to extract an abelian theory with charges and monopoles performing a partial gauge - fixing .",

    "there are infinite ways of extracting an abelian theory out of qcd .",
    "maximally abelian(ma ) gauge is exciting . in this gauge , many interesting facts have been found .",
    "there are phenomena called abelian dominance @xcite .",
    "the string tension from abelian wilson loops is produced only by monopoles @xcite .",
    "the effective monopole action is derived from vacuum configulations @xcite . in the infinite volume limit",
    ", entropy dominance over energy induces the condensation of the monopoles , which leads us to the confinement of the abelian charges , i.e. , the color confinement .",
    "therefore the ( extended ) monopoles control the confinement mechanism in ma gauge .",
    "the following subjects are to be clarified :    \\1 ) relation of the monopole dynamics to the deconfinement transition and    \\2 ) gauge dependence of the monopole dynamics .    from this point of view , we investigate the polyakov loop which is an important order parameter of the deconfinement transition .    in this note , we show the abelian polyakov loop is written by a product of monopole dirac string part and photon part and vanishing of the abelian polyakov loop comes only from the monopole dirac - string contributions not only in ma gauge but also in unitary gauges .",

    "after any gauge fixing is over , we can extract an abelian link variable @xmath5 and an angle variable @xmath6 from it@xcite . now let us show that an abelian polyakov loop operator of an external current @xmath7 @xmath8 , \\label{apol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is given by a product of monopole and photon contributions .    using the definition of a plaquette variable @xmath9",
