    "in the  case of lmxbs containing neutron or quark stars we propose a new model of twin peak hf qpos assuming switching of the twin oscillatory modes creating sequences of the lower and upper hf qpos at a resonant point .",
    "according to such a resonant switch ( rs ) model non - linear resonant phenomena will cause excitation of a new oscillatory mode ( or two new oscillatory modes ) and vanishing of one of the previously acting modes ( or both the previous modes ) , i.e. , switching from one pair of the oscillatory modes to other pair of them that will be acting up to the following resonant point  @xcite .",
    "we assume two resonant points at the  disc radii @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with observed frequencies @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , being in commensurable ratios @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "these resonant frequencies are determined by the  energy switch effect ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* trk 2009 ) ) ; observations put the  restrictions @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in the  region covering the  resonant point at @xmath6",
    "the  twin oscillatory modes with the  upper ( lower ) frequency are determined by the  function @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) . near the  inner resonant point at @xmath7 different oscillatory modes given by the  frequency functions @xmath18 and",
    "@xmath19 occur ( @xmath20 is the  dimensionless radius ) .",
    "we assume all the  frequency functions to be determined by combinations of the  orbital and epicyclic frequencies of the  geodesic motion in the  kerr backgrounds .",
    "such a  simplification is correct with high precision for neutron ( quark ) stars with large masses , close to the maximum mass allowed for a  given equation of state .",
    "the  frequency functions have to meet the  observationally given resonant frequencies . in the  framework of the  simple rs  model , when two resonant points and two pairs of the  frequency functions are assumed , this requirement enables determination of the  neutron ( quark ) star parameters .",
    "the  `` shooting '' of the  frequency functions to the  resonant points can be realized efficiently in two steps .",
    "independence of the  frequency ratio on the  mass parameter @xmath3 implies the  conditions @xmath21 giving relations for the  spin @xmath2 in terms of the  dimensionless radius @xmath22 and the  resonant frequency ratio @xmath23 .",
    "they can be expressed in the  form @xmath24 and @xmath25 , or in an  inverse form @xmath26 and @xmath27 . at the  resonant radii",
    "the  conditions @xmath28 are satisfied along the  functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 which are obtained by using the  functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the  parameters of the  neutron ( quark ) star are then given by the  condition @xmath31 the  condition ( [ rs ] ) determines @xmath3 and @xmath2 precisely , if the  resonant frequencies are determined precisely .",
    "if an  error occurs in determination of the  resonant frequencies , as naturally expected , our method gives related intervals of acceptable values of mass and spin parameter of the  neutron ( quark ) star .",
    "we test the rs model in the  case of the  atoll 4u  1636@xmath453 source that seems to be the  best possibility due to the  character of the  observational data demonstrating clearly existence of two `` resonant points '' where the  energy switch effect occurs . using the  results of @xcite ,",
    "the  resonant frequencies determined by the  energy switch effect are given in the  outer resonant point with frequency ratio @xmath32 by the  frequency intervals @xmath33 and at the  inner resonant point with frequency ratio @xmath34 there is @xmath35 we consider the  standard specific models of the  twin oscillations based on the  orbital and epicyclic geodetical frequencies and in the framework of the rs model we determine range of allowed values of spin @xmath2 and mass @xmath3 of the  neutron star located at the  atoll source 4u  1636@xmath453 .",
    "the  predicted ranges of the  neutron star parameters are strongly dependent on the  twin modes applied in the  rs  model .",
    "the mass and spin estimates of the rs model have to be confronted with restrictions on the neutron star mass and spin implied by the theoretical models of neutron ( quark ) stars and the observed rotational frequency of the neutron star at 4u  1636@xmath453 .",
    "we consider as acceptable upper values @xmath36 , @xmath37 and demonstrate that for some of the  oscillatory modes used in the  rs  model the  predicted parameters of the  neutron star are unacceptable , being too high . among acceptable rs  models the  most promising are those combining the  relativistic precession ( where @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) and the  total precession ( where @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) frequency relations or their modifications . the switch of the oscillating modes is not given by the resonant phenomena necessarily .",
    "the cause could be , e.g. , given by the magnetic field , then the alfvn wave model ( @xcite ) can be relevant",
