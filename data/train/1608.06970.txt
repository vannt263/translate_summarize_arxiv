    "over the past several years there has been interest in gravitational theories with a dynamical vector field , including einstein - aether theory@xcite , teves@xcite , and hoava gravity@xcite ( which in certain cases can be regarded as a limiting case of einstein - aether theory@xcite ) .",
    "there are various motivations for these studies , including efforts to quantize gravity , or to provide an alternative explanation for those effects usually attributed to dark matter , or simply to provide an alternative to general relativity that could possibly be distinguished by observations of gravitational radiation .",
    "one interesting aspect of gravity is black holes , so it is natural to ask what are the properties of black holes in these theories . here",
    "one can find black holes by assuming a static spacetime with an event horizon and finding the corresponding solution of the field equations . or one can numerically simulate gravitational collapse and find the endstate of the process . for einstein - aether theory ,",
    "both of these approaches have been used.@xcite the approach of @xcite was to assume a static , spherically symmetric spacetime with an event horizon .",
    "these assumptions reduced the field equations of the theory to a set of coupled ordinary differential equations ( for the fields as a function of the radial coordinate ) which satisfied an appropriate set of boundary conditions ( smoothness at the horizon and asymptotic flatness at infinity ) .",
    "these equations could not be solved in closed form , but could be solved numerically .",
    "einstein - aether theory contains four free parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath1 representing coefficients of different terms in the action .",
    "in@xcite black hole solutions were found for certain ranges of the parameters ; however , it was found that when @xmath2 was sufficiently large the method did not find black hole solutions .",
    "the fact that a black hole solution exists does not necessarily mean that the corresponding black hole is actually the endstate of gravitational collapse . to explore this issue , in @xcite simulations",
    "were performed of gravitational collapse in einstein - aether theory in spherical symmetry with a scalar field providing the matter stress - energy .",
    "here it was found that with the @xmath3 in the range where @xcite found black hole solutions , the endstate of gravitational collapse was indeed the corresponding black hole solution .",
    "however , for the large values of @xmath2 for which the method of @xcite failed to find black holes , the collapse simulations of @xcite resulted in configurations in which the spatial derivatives of the fields became very large , which the authors of @xcite speculated was a precursor of the formation of a naked singularity .",
    "this naked singularity interpretation was rendered somewhat dubious when the authors of @xcite revisited the ordinary differential equation calculation of static black hole solutions with improved methods and succeeded in finding solutions for large values of @xmath2 where the previous treatment of @xcite failed to find solutions .",
    "are these additional solutions the endstates of gravitational collapse ? and if so , then why did the simulations of @xcite fail to find them ? to answer these questions ,",
    "we revisit the collapse simulation problem with our own improved numerical methods .",
    "one possible reason for fields to have a large spatial derivative is simply an unfortunate choice of spatial coordinate .",
    "we therefore perform for each gravitational collapse situation , two simulations : one with the radial coordinate used in @xcite and one with a different radial coordinate .",
    "in addition , we introduce a more general type of initial data and an improved outer boundary condition for better stability and to allow the simulation to run longer .",
    "much to our surprise , we find that the collapse process for large @xmath2 produces neither black holes nor naked singularities . instead the collapse results in white holes ! that is , during the collapse rather than a trapped surface forming , an anti - trapped surface forms instead .",
    "this anti - trapped surface is a temporary phenomenon , and eventually the fields disperse .",
    "therefore the additional solutions of @xcite are not the endstates of gravitational collapse .    in section",
    "ii we present the relevant facts about the field equations of einstein - aether theory , while section iii treats the initial data used and the method by which the field equations are evolved .",
    "( detailed treatments of the equations of motion using the two different radial coordinates are given in appendicies ) .",
    "in section iv we present our results .",
    "conclusions are given in section v.",
    "einstein - aether theory @xcite is general relativity with a dynamical unit timelike vector field .",
    "this vector field can not vanish ; it picks out a preferred reference frame and thus the theory spontaneously breaks lorentz invariance .",
    "the action @xmath4 for einstein - aether theory is chosen to be the most general , generally covariant functional of the spacetime metric @xmath5 and the aether field @xmath6 , involving no more than two derivatives .",
    "this results in four terms involving the aether field , and they are included with arbitrary coefficients .",
    "the action takes the form@xcite : s = ( l_ae + l_matter ) d^4x , where , l_ae = [ r - k^ab_mn_a u^m_bu^n + ( g_abu^au^b + 1 ) ] .",
    "here @xmath7 denotes the ricci scalar , @xmath8 a parameter related to newton s constant @xcite , @xmath9 denotes the matter lagrangian density and @xmath10 is a lagrange multiplier enforcing the condition that the aether field is unit timelike at all points of spacetime .",
    "@xmath11 is defined as :",
    "_ mn = c_1g^abg_mn + c_2^a_m^b_n + c_3^a_n^b_m - c_4u^au^bg_mn , where the @xmath3 are dimensionless constants .",
    "the lorentzian signature used in this paper is ( @xmath12,+,+,+ ) and the units are chosen so that the speed of light defined by the metric @xmath5 is 1 .",
    "einstein - aether theory possesses spin-1 , spin-2 and spin-0 massless modes that travel at speeds different from each other and from the speed of light , so that for a solution to describe a black hole in einstein - aether theory , all of these wave modes must also be trapped in the region of the black hole .",
    "we take the matter field to be a minimally coupled massless scalar field @xmath13 , following the choice in @xcite , with lagrangian @xmath14 , which we scale by @xmath15 = @xmath16 to simplify the form of the field equations .",
    "the matter lagrangian is then :    l_matter = _ a^a .",
    "we choose the surfaces of constant time in our simulation to be those orthogonal to @xmath6 .",
    "this choice is possible since we will be working in a spherically symmetric system for which @xmath6 is necessarily hypersurface orthogonal . as is usual in numerical relativity ,",
    "the metric degrees of freedom are described in terms of the spatial metric , extrinsic curvature , lapse function and shift vector .",
    "the spatial metric @xmath17 and extrinsic curvature @xmath18 are given by h_ab = g_ab + u_au_b , [ hdef ] + k_ab = -1 2l_u h_ab , [ kdef ] where @xmath19 denotes the lie derivative .",
    "due to the property of spherical symmetry , the spacetime line element takes the form d s^2 = - ^2 d t^2 + + r^2 ( d^2 + ^2d ^2 ) [ sphds2 ] where @xmath20 is the lapse function and @xmath21 is the shift vector .",
    "comparison of eqns .",
    "( [ hdef ] ) and ( [ sphds2 ] ) shows that @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the quantity @xmath24 is called the `` area radius '' and has the property that the area of each symmetry 2-sphere is @xmath25 .",
    "note that in contrast to the schwarzschild solution we do not choose @xmath24 as our radial coordinate .",
    "the reason for this is that the numerical evolution method needs the radial coordinate to be spacelike , whereas the area radius @xmath24 becomes null where an apparent horizon forms .",
    "therefore numerical simulations that use @xmath24 as the radial coordinate can not follow the evolution past the formation of an apparent horizon .",
    "there is still some freedom to choose the radial coordinate .",
    "the numerical method of @xcite , which is also our first numerical method , chooses the radial coordinate to be length in the radial direction , which imposes the condition that @xmath26 .",
    "our second numerical method chooses the time evolution vector field to be the aether field @xmath6 , which imposes the condition @xmath27 .    due to spherical symmetry",
    ", the extrinsic curvature @xmath28 has only two independent degrees of freedom , which we choose to be the trace of the extrinsic curvature , denoted @xmath29 , and the radial direction eigenvalue of the trace - free part of the extrinsic curvature , denoted @xmath30 .",
    "the scalar field degrees of freedom are given by the scalar field @xmath15 and its devivative in the @xmath6 direction , denoted @xmath31 . it remains to describe the aether field degrees of freedom . since we have made the choice that our surfaces of constant time are those orthogonal to @xmath6 , most of the information about @xmath32 is already given by @xmath18 .",
    "the only remaining aether field degree of freedom is the acceleration of the aether field @xmath33 , which due to spherical symmetry has only a single component @xmath34 .",
    "the initial conditions for the scalar field are specified by giving the values at the initial time of @xmath15 and @xmath31 .",
    "similarly , the initial conditions for the aether field are specified by giving the values at the initial time of @xmath29 and @xmath34 .",
    "we would like those initial conditions to describe a spherical shell that is initially widely enough dispersed so that it is not very strongly gravitating , but also initially radially ingoing so that as it becomes smaller its self gravity may lead to the formation of a black hole .",
    "we choose the following initial data for the scalar field & = & r(e^-()^2 - e^-()^2 ) , [ psiinit ] + p & = & - , [ pinit ] here , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are constants with the following interpretation : the initial wave forms a spherical shell with a gaussian profile , with @xmath37 the amplitude of the wave , @xmath38 the radius of the shell , and @xmath36 the width of the shell .",
    "the first term in parentheses in eqn .",
    "( [ psiinit ] ) gives the gaussian profile , while the second term is needed to insure that the wave is smooth at @xmath39 .",
    "the form of eqn .",
    "( [ pinit ] ) is what is needed to combine with eqn .",
    "( [ psiinit ] ) to make the wave purely ingoing .",
    "we choose the following initial data for the aether field degrees of freedom @xmath34 and @xmath29 = - , [ arinit ] + k = k a_2 , [ kinit ] here the constants @xmath38 and @xmath36 are the same as in eqns .",
    "( [ psiinit]-[pinit ] ) , the constant @xmath40 is the amplitude of the aether wave and the constant @xmath41 is chosen to make the wave purely ingoing .",
    "the reason for this form of the initial data is the following : the equations of motion for @xmath34 and @xmath29 are similar to those for the wave equation written in first order form with @xmath34 playing the role of the radial derivative of the scalar wave function and @xmath29 playing the role of the time derivative of the wave function .",
    "thus if we choose that wave to have the gaussian form of ( [ psiinit ] ) with the same radius and width as the scalar wave @xmath15 but with its own independent amplitude , then @xmath34 takes the form of the spatial derivative of that wave and @xmath29 takes the form that the time derivative of that wave would need to make the wave purely ingoing .    in method 1 , we have @xmath42 , so in order that both methods compare the same solutions , we choose the initial data for @xmath43 to be @xmath42 for method 2 . the hamiltonian constraint equation , eqn .",
    "( [ ham1 ] ) ( which for @xmath26 also provides a solution to eqn .",
    "( [ ham2 ] ) ) is then solved numerically to obtain initial data for @xmath24 .",
    "we now turn to the evolution of the data . in method 1 , the variables @xmath44 are evolved using eqns .",
    "( [ dtpsi1],[dtp1],[dtar1],[dtk1],[dtr1 ] ) respectively , while at each time step the variables @xmath45 are obtained by integrating with respect to @xmath46 eqns .",

    "( [ dtpsi2],[dtp2],[dtar2],[dtk2],[dtr2],[dtgamma ] ) respectively , while at each time step the variables @xmath48 are obtained by integrating with respect to @xmath46 eqns .",
    "( [ drq2],[dralpha2 ] ) respectively .",
    "the aether field has a spin-0 mode that travels at speed @xmath49 where @xcite : = as in the later part of @xcite we will choose @xmath50 and will choose @xmath51 so that the speed of the spin-0 mode is 1 , which insures that the horizon for the spin-0 mode coincides with the regular horizon . the condition of unit @xmath49 along with vanishing @xmath52 and @xmath1 yields = [ c2 ] thus , all the constants are determined once we pick @xmath2 .",
    "we begin with a convergence test to check the reliability of the simulations .",
    "recall that there is a constraint quantity @xmath53 that vanishes for exact solutions but will not vanish for numerical solutions due to errors involving the finite ( space and time ) step size .",
    "because our methods are second order , halving the step size should result in the constraint being four times smaller . to check this , we run two simulations , one with 10,000 spatial grid points and one with 20,000 . we plot on the same graph , @xmath53 for the coarse simulation and @xmath54 for the fine simulation .",
    "agreement between the two curves indicates second order convergence .",
    "the results are shown in figures [ cnstrm1 ] ( for numerical method 1 ) and [ cnstrm2 ] ( for numerical method 2 ) .",
    "the parameters for these simulations are @xmath55 .",
    "we choose an outer radius of @xmath56 and run the simulations for a time of @xmath57 . at this time",
    "a weakly gravitating wave would have already dispersed to its original size ; but these fields are strongly gravitating and therefore remain confined at smaller radius . in each case",

    "note that these simulations represent the same situation since they have the same initial data and the same time slicing .",
    "however , the two curves in each figure are different because the @xmath46 coordinate of method 1 is different from the @xmath46 coordinate of method 2 .",

    "our numerical investigations of gravitational collapse in einstein - aether theory have turned up an unexpected result : under certain circumstances white holes can form in the collapse process .",
    "however , we note that these white holes differ in several important respects from the textbook white holes of the extended kruskal diagram of the schwarzschild spacetime . in particular , our white holes do not have a singularity in the past , but instead come from the evolution of nonsingular initial data representing a collapsing shell .",
    "this means that to the past of our initial data surface these spacetimes simply consisted of ingoing shells , and the further we go into the past the more highly dispersed and thus less strongly gravitating these shells are .",
    "our white holes thus manage to evade the penrose theorem which ( in the time reverse of its usually stated form ) requires that an anti - trapped surface be accompanied by a singularity to the past .",
    "this evasion is possible because the penrose theorem posits as a condition that the stress - energy tensor satisfy the null energy condition .",
    "einstein - aether theory does not satisfy the null energy condition , and therefore the penrose theorem places no restriction on the formation of white holes in this theory .",
    "we note that some of the theories considered in various cosmological models ( such as k - essence or gallileons ) also violate energy conditions .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether white holes can be produced in gravitational collapse in these theories .",
    "also , unlike the extended kruskal diagram , our white holes only last for a finite amount of time .",
    "this is similar to the prediction of eardley@xcite for the fate of any white holes in the early universe .",
    "however , both the physical processes and the outcome are somewhat different in our case .",
    "in particular eardley considers the dynamics of photons in the kruskal spacetime and conjectures that the white hole will eventually be transformed into a black hole .",
    "in contrast , we treat the dynamics of the aether field and a self - gravitating scalar field , and we find that eventually the fields disperse .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that though @xcite find static black hole solutions even for the case of large @xmath2 , our collapse simulations of the large @xmath2 case do not result in the formation of those black holes .",
    "however , we note that static solutions found by solving odes can be either stable or unstable ; but that the endstate of a collapse process will only result in stable solutions .",
    "this suggests that perhaps the large @xmath2 solutions found in @xcite are unstable .",
    "this conjecture could be checked through a numerical treatment of the perturbative modes of those solutions .    finally , we consider ways of overcoming the numerical challenges of the sharp features that develop during the aether collapse process .",
    "one possibility is to simply perform simulations with a very large number of spatial points .",
    "however , a more efficient solution would be for the simulations to make use of adaptive mesh refinement .",
