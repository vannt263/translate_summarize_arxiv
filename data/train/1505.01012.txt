    "the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) , a fundamental model in statistic physics , is a stochastic process with arbitrary distributions of jump lengths and waiting times .",
    "when the jump length and/or waiting time distribution(s ) are / is power law and the second order moment of jump lengths and/or the first order moment of waiting times are / is divergent , the ctrw describes the anomalous diffusion , i.e. , the super and sub diffusive cases ; and its fokker - planck equation has space and/or time fractional derivative(s ) @xcite .",
    "it can be noted that the corresponding fractional pdes are essentially dealing with the multiscale phenomena ; and generally the fractional pdes have weaker regularity at the area close to boundary and initial time . besides anomalous diffusion ,",
    "the fractional models are also used to characterize the memory and hereditary properties inherent in various materials and processes and , recently , much more scientific applications are found in a variety of fields ; see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the obtained analytical solutions of fractional pdes are usually in the form of transcendental functions or infinite series ; and in much more cases , the analytical solutions are not available . then the approximation and numerical techniques for solving the fractional pdes become essential and have been developed very fast recently , such as , the finite difference method @xcite , the finite element method @xcite , and the spectral method @xcite . but",
    "the computational expenses and nonuniform regularity are still the big challenges that one faces in numerically solving the fractional pdes , owing to the nonlocality and potential multiscale characteristics of the fractional derivatives ; and basing on the preconditioning , adaptivity , and fast transform techniques to develop high efficient methods seems to be a new trend .",
    "the preconditioning techniques are discussed in @xcite , where the krylov subspace projection is their common theme .",
    "fast transform method and multigrid method are provided in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "so far , there seems to be very limited works @xcite to solve the fractional pdes or odes by wavelet , although the wavelet numerical methods for classical pdes or odes have been well developed @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to dig out the potential advantages of wavelets in treating the fractional operators , including preconditioning , multigrid , adaptivity , and keeping the quasi - toeplitz structure for arbitrary order wavelet bases .",
    "more concretely , the clearly obtained benefits of wavelets for fractional operator consist of the following : 1 ) stiffness matrix of fractional operator is toeplitz for scaling bases because of their shift - invariant property ( it is not always true for the familiar finite element bases , such as the quadratic or cubic element ) and a simple diagonal scaling usually produces a good preconditioner ; 2 ) multiscale coefficients indicate the local regularity , and they can be used as the indicator ( local posteriori error estimate seems hard to be obtained for the adaptive finite element method because of the global property of the operator ) in the adaptive mesh refinement for controlling the entire computational process and increasing the efficiency , i.e. , one only needs to make the local refinement on the subdomain where the wavelet coefficients are larger compared with those of other places . for avoiding all non indispensable complications , we present the main ideas and techniques in their simplest form and restrict ourselves to the following homogeneously space fractional pde @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 or @xmath4 ; and @xmath5 is a @xmath6-th @xmath7 order differential operator @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the generalized diffusivity ; @xmath10",
    ", @xmath11 represents a single spatial derivative ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the left and right fractional integral operators @xcite , being , respectively , defined as @xmath14 when @xmath15 , one gets the fractional initial boundary value problem ( ibvp ) with an additional initial condition @xmath16 ; and when @xmath3 , it is the fractional boundary value problem ( bvp ) , which can also be regarded as the steady state equation of the associated ibvp . considering the homogeneous boundary condition and using integration by parts , one can easily get @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    ". then one can reduce the model ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) to a more familiar form , and a basic theoretical framework for its variational solution has been presented in @xcite ; this will enable us to put focus on the wavelet numerical methods themselves .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give a brief recall to the spline scaling and wavelet functions .",
    "they have the closed - form expression , which is of course attractive for the fractional operators . in section 3 ,",
    "we study the computational formulation with respect to the uniform grids .",
    "we first discuss the effective way to construct the algebraic system , and then derive the multilevel wavelet preconditioning and the multiresolution multigrid schemes ( mmg ) for solving the bvp and ibvp , respectively . in section 4",
    ", we give some heuristically adaptive algorithms and show how singularities can be easily detected by wavelet , and put our attention on its efficiency by proposing and testing the adaptive algorithms that concentrate the degrees of freedom in the neighborhood of near singularities .",
    "the numerical results are shown in section 5 and we conclude the paper with some remarks in the last section .",
    "in this section , we collect / present some essential properties of the scaling functions and wavelets to make the paper self - contained and more readable . for the details , refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "first , we give the definitions of the fractional sobolev spaces used in this paper . for any @xmath19 ,",
    "let @xmath20 be the sobolev space of order @xmath21 on @xmath22 , and @xmath23 the space of the restriction of the functions from @xmath20 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath24 endowed with the seminorm @xmath25(\\omega)\\right|^2d\\omega\\ ] ] and the norm @xmath26(\\omega)\\right|^2d\\omega\\sim \\int_{\\mathbb{r}}\\left(1+|\\omega|^2\\right)^{\\mu}\\left|\\mathscr{f}[u](\\omega)\\right|^2d\\omega;\\ ] ] @xmath27 endowed with @xmath28 where @xmath29 $ ] denotes the fourier transform of @xmath30 . and @xmath31 is defined as the closure of @xmath32 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath34f$ ] denote the @xmath35-th order _ divided difference _ of @xmath36 at the points @xmath37 , @xmath38 ; and choose the schoenberg sequence of knots @xmath39 to define the scaling function sets @xmath40 with @xmath41(t - x)_+^{d-1},\\ ] ] which is the scaled b - splines @xcite .",
    "then the sequence @xmath42 forms a multiresolution analysis ( mra ) of @xmath43 , where @xmath44 .",
    "the system @xmath45 is uniformly local and locally finite , i.e. , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ; it forms a stable riesz basis of @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath49 and @xmath48 satisfies the jackson and bernstein estimates , i.e. , @xmath50 where @xmath51 and by @xmath52 we mean that @xmath53 can be bounded by a multiple of @xmath54 , independent of the parameters they may depend on .    since @xmath45 is a riesz basis of @xmath48 , there exists a dual mra sequence @xmath55 , which also forms a mra of @xmath56 .",
    "and one can define the biorthogonal projector : @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the @xmath59 inner product .",
    "then @xmath60 , and for @xmath61 , @xmath62 one can also construct the interval biorthogonal wavelet sets @xmath63 and @xmath64 ; it holds the norm equivalence , i.e. , there exist @xmath65 such that for the sobolev space @xmath66 , @xmath67 where @xmath68 ; @xmath69 denotes the lowest level .",
    "it also means that @xmath70 is a riesz basis of @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , denote @xmath71 .",
    "then the operator @xmath72 is a projection onto the space @xmath73 , having the representation @xmath74 and for @xmath75 , there exists @xmath76 this shows that the wavelet coefficients are small provided that the function is locally smooth , which is the foundation to design wavelet adaptive algorithms .",
    "note that based on the scaling function sets @xmath45 , some other special wavelets can also be constructed .",
    "if one demands @xmath77 and @xmath78 , the semiorthogonal wavelets @xmath79 can be obtained @xcite ; if one chooses @xmath80 , @xmath81 , then the interpolation wavelet @xmath82 is obtained , and it also satisfies the norm equivalence for @xmath83 ( page 605 of @xcite ) ; and if @xmath84 , let @xmath85 , and define @xmath86 and @xmath87 by @xmath88 one has the semi - interpolation spline wavelet @xmath89 , which satisfies the so - called _ point value vanishing property _ ; and the wavelet expansion coefficients also indicate the regularity of the approximation function @xcite .",
    "in practice , the base functions @xmath90 and @xmath91 are usually added for removing the limitation that the first order derivative of the ( to be approximated ) function at the boundary needs to be zero .",
    "finally , we point out that there exists the refinement relations @xmath92 and the space @xmath93 can be written as @xmath94 . for any @xmath95",
    ", it follows that @xmath96 denote @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "then there exists a fast wavelet transform ( fwt ) between the single - scale and the multiscale representations , i.e. , @xmath100 which can be performed with the cost @xmath0 ; here @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the nonlocal property of fractional operator makes the matrix of its discretizations inevitably dense .",
    "we will show that the chosen bases being the dilation and translation of one single function render the matrix to have a special structure , which greatly reduces the cost of computing and storing the entires . in this sense , these kind of bases are superior to the other possible bases , such as the usually used finite element or spectral polynomial bases .",
    "meanwhile , based on the benefits of these bases , a simple diagonal preconditioner and the fast transform are presented to enhance the effectiveness of the widely used nonlinear or linear iterative schemes .",
    "we first consider the bvp of ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) with @xmath3 .",
    "it has the variational formulation : find @xmath103 with @xmath104 , such that @xmath105 more precisely , using integration by parts and the adjoint property of fractional integral operator @xcite leads to @xmath106    the bilinear form @xmath107 is continuous and coercive @xcite , i.e. , @xmath108 for @xmath109 , eq . ( [ eq:2.2.1 ] ) admits a unique solution . letting @xmath93",
    "be a subspace of @xmath110 with order @xmath35 , the galerkin approximation @xmath111 belonging to @xmath93 satisfies @xmath112 if @xmath30 is sufficiently smooth , following ( [ project ] ) and the ce@xmath113 s lemma , one gets @xmath114    for space discretization , one can either use the scaling basis @xmath115 or the multiscale basis @xmath116 , generating the following linear systems , respectively , @xmath117 where @xmath118 .",
    "there are the following lemmas .",
    "[ shift:1 ] let @xmath119 , supp@xmath120$]and @xmath121 .",
    "then @xmath122 if and only if @xmath123 .    for @xmath119",
    ", there holds @xmath124 which just depends on the value of @xmath125 .",
    "the second part of ( [ elliptic ] ) can be expressed by its first part , i.e. , @xmath126 then the desired result is obtained .",
    "[ shift:2 ] let @xmath127 and @xmath128 be given as above , and @xmath129 .",
    "define @xmath130 and @xmath131 with @xmath132 and supp@xmath133 $ ] , where @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "then @xmath136    similar to lemma [ shift:1 ] , it follows that @xmath137 by the properties of symmetry and compact support , there exists @xmath138 where the fubini - tonelli theorem and @xmath139 are used .",
    "it is also easy to check that for any @xmath140 , @xmath141 now , from the structure of @xmath142 @xcite and the above lemmas , one knows that the matrix @xmath143 has a quasi - toeplitz structure , that is , it is a toeplitz matrix after removing very few rows and columns near the boundaries .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath80 , it is a full toeplitz matrix , but for @xmath144 and @xmath84 , they have the following structures , respectively , @xmath145 where @xmath146 are real numbers ; @xmath147 are vectors , @xmath148 the reverse order of @xmath147 ; and @xmath149 is toeplitz matrix .",
    "the fact that the bases are obtained by dilating and translating of a single function and the symmetry of the bases are essential for obtaining the above results , recalling that they do not hold for the general finite element ( except linear element ) and spectral methods . for the high order",
    "finite difference methods , the similar results can be got after modifying the approximation near the boundary for recovering the desired accuracy @xcite , but it seems that the general theoretical results ( stability , convergence and so on ) are hard to obtain .",
    "further results for the generated matrix are @xmath150    the structure of @xmath142 also allows one to compute its riemann - liouville fractional derivative easily , which can greatly reduce the computational complexity of generating the differential matrix in galerkin and collocation methods ( see section 5 ) . as an example , we present the techniques for @xmath84 in appendix , being similar for other values of @xmath35 . then combining with ( [ struction2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3.15e ] ) , the left differential matrix @xmath151 can be calculated exactly or numerically with the cost @xmath152 , being superior to the traditional finite element and spectral approximation with the cost @xmath153 @xcite .      for an algebraic system with dense matrix ,",
    "a well convergent iterative method generally has the computational cost @xmath154 or @xmath153 , which is much less than the cost @xmath155 of the direct method .",
    "moreover , a well conditional number and ` bunching of eigenvalues ' usually bring good numerical stability and fast convergence speed @xcite . in general , for a linear system @xmath156 , a satisfactory preconditioned system @xmath157 should have the property @xmath158 and the computational cost for the preconditioning step is cheap . here ,",
    "both the matrix @xmath159 and @xmath160 are dense , and their condition numbers are of order @xmath161 ; see table [ tab:2_1 ] for example 5.2 .",
    "but with the aid of wavelet bases , by the norm equivalence , a simple diagonal scaling can lead to a good preconditioned system .",
    "in fact , define @xmath162 @xmath163 combining the ellipticity ( [ coervcice ] ) , norm equivalence ( [ normequiv ] ) , and the riesz representation theorem , one gets that for all @xmath164 , @xmath165 @xmath166 therefore , there exist @xmath167 not depending on @xmath168 such that @xmath169 now , one arrives at @xmath170 the norm equivalence implies @xmath171 , so one can also define matrix @xmath172 by the inverse square root of the diagonal of @xmath160 , and ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) still hold .",
    "usually the current @xmath172 performs better since it uses the information directly from the stiffness matrix , and we will use it in section 5 .",
    "moreover , the cost of generating @xmath172 is only @xmath173 ; this is because that by using the translation property of the inner wavelet on the same level , one just needs to calculate the entries @xmath174 near the boundaries and one in the inner part without the necessity to assemble @xmath160 .",
    "now , one can rewrite ( [ eq:3.2 ] ) as the two - sided preconditioned form @xmath175 further using ( [ eq:2.16 ] ) , one gets that @xmath176 a straightforward product of @xmath159 or @xmath160 to a given vector needs a computational cost @xmath177 .",
    "but if one uses the quasi - toeplitz structure of the matrix , the computational cost can be reduced to @xmath178 .",
    "in fact , one can rewrite @xmath159 as @xmath179 where @xmath180 and @xmath181 denote the coefficient vectors , formed by the coefficient of space fractional derivative taking values at the discretized intervals , and @xmath182 and @xmath183 are quasi - toeplitz matrices . using the fft to the matrix - vector product makes the computational cost @xmath178 @xcite . finally , because the fwt ( having the matrix representation @xmath184 or @xmath185 , which denotes the primal reconstruction or the dual decomposition @xcite ) can be implemented with the cost @xmath0 , if the cg scheme ( symmetric ) is applied to ( [ eq:3.10 ] ) or to the corresponding normal equation ( asymmetric ) ,",
    "the well conditioned number of the matrix implies that the convergence rate is independent of the level @xmath168 ; then we can solve it with the total operations @xmath178 .",
    "for the general iterative schemes , such as gmres or bi - cgstab , usually one can show that the system with clustered spectrum and well conditioned number after preconditioning has an accelerated convergence .",
    "what s more , compared with the most existing preconditioners which require the solving of a linear system ( see , e.g. , the ilu @xcite and the strang @xcite ) , the wavelet preconditioning operation reduces to the matrix - vector product , where fwt can be used .",
    "the multigrid method based on the finite difference discretization for solving the fractional ibvps have been developed in @xcite , where the transition operators ( restriction and prolongation operators ) between the grids are chosen as the full weight and interpolation operators . in this subsection , we investigate the mmg method for solving fractional ibvps .",
    "we will show that the transition operators in the mra background can be more straightforwardly defined . and using the techniques presented in the above content , the mmg scheme can also be fast implemented .    denoting @xmath48 as the subspace ,",
    "@xmath186 with @xmath187 and @xmath188 with @xmath189 , one arrives at the semidiscrete form : find @xmath190 such that @xmath191 taking the time mesh as @xmath192 and the stepsizes @xmath193 , one gets the backward euler multiresolution galerkin method ( b - mgm ) @xmath194 and the crank - nicolson multiresolution galerkin method ( cn - mgm ) @xmath195 where @xmath196 .",
    "introduce the bilinear form @xmath197 , where @xmath198 for the b - mgm and @xmath199 for the cn - mgm .",
    "define @xmath200 with @xmath201 @xmath202 , and the operator @xmath203 with @xmath204 @xmath202 .",
    "then the mgm schemes can be rewritten uniformly as the form @xmath205 where @xmath206 for the b - mgm and @xmath207 for the cn - mgm , respectively .",
    "suppose that @xmath208 , and define @xmath209 , @xmath210 .",
    "denoting @xmath211 , one also gets the algebraic representation of ( [ multigrid ] ) given by @xmath212 .    the basic iteration algorithm for the operator equation ( [ multigrid ] ) is @xcite @xmath213 with the error propagation operator @xmath214 and the iterator @xmath215 . for the damped richardson and jacobi methods , the iterators are , respectively , given by @xmath216 they can also be regarded as the correction with subspaces decomposition @xmath217 with @xmath218",
    "; and one can also rewrite the jacobi iterator as @xmath219 where @xmath220 with @xmath221 .",

    "recall that the refinement relation ( [ refine - raltion ] ) , one can get the prolongation matrix @xmath253 straightforward , and it holds @xmath254   \\widetilde{q_jr^{n+1}_{j+1}}=m_{j,0}^t\\widetilde{r^{n+1}_{j+1 } } \\quad \\forall r^{n+1}_{j+1}\\in s_{j+1 } ,   \\end{array }   \\right.\\ ] ] where the meaning of @xmath255 is defined after eq .",
