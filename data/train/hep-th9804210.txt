    "in the modern viewpoint on gauge symmetry enhancement in open string theory , the gauge vectors associated to a @xmath2 gauge algebra are seen to arise from open strings beginning and ending on a collection of @xmath3 dirichlet branes ( see @xcite ) . given the utility and simplicity of brane pictures for gauge theory it is of interest to understand the brane picture of other gauge algebras .",
    "a natural laboratory for this problem is iib superstrings compactified on a two - sphere in the presence of several 7-branes appearing as points on this sphere and extending along the other spatial dimensions . in this background",
    "both strings and seven branes carry @xmath1 labels . here",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 are relatively prime integers denoting for the case of a string the charges under the ns - ns and rr antisymmetric tensors respectively .",
    "a @xmath6 $ ] seven - brane is a seven - brane where a @xmath7 string can end .",
    "the f - theory picture @xcite of this superstring background was used to obtain the specific 7-brane content that would lead to the @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) gauge algebras @xcite .",
    "such gauge algebras require branes of various @xmath6 $ ] types .",
    "it was naturally assumed that open strings , represented by geodesic lines on the two sphere joining suitable branes , would give rise to the gauge vectors of the corresponding algebra .",
    "this is not always the case ; depending on the positions of the branes , a given gauge vector is realized sometimes as a geodesic string , but more generally it is realized as a geodesic string junction @xcite .",
    "indeed , such transitions were examined explicitly in @xcite where strong evidence was given to the effect that given a specific configuration of branes either a unique open string or a unique string junction is geodesic .",
    "string junctions , originally introduced in @xcite , have been the subject of much recent study with regards to their bps properties @xcite , their dynamics @xcite , their role in @xmath12 super - yang - mills @xcite , as well as for their relevance to dualities @xcite and to the analysis of bps states of @xmath13 sym theory @xcite .",
    "there is also a parallel line of development dealing with @xmath6 $ ] five - branes and five dimensional gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for considering junctions in @xcite was that such string states can carry manifestly the gauge charges under the obvious subalgebras and this enables one to reproduce the structure of the exceptional algebras by combining junctions the same way one combines open strings .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to give a firm lie - algebraic basis to junctions , explaining the reason for much of the coincidences noted in @xcite .",
    "while that work dealt with adjoint representations only , we will be able to discuss here arbitrary representations of the _ ade _ series of algebras .",
    "since junctions represent states with gauge charges , they are naturally associated to weight vectors belonging to some representation of the relevant algebra .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to show how to calculate the weight vector associated with an arbitrary junction , and conversely , given an arbitrary representation of an _ ade _ algebra , to show how to construct the junctions representing the corresponding string states .",
    "it is clear that representations other than adjoints are present in applications , typically as massive bps states @xcite .",
    "some of our results related to @xmath14 symmetry were anticipated in an interesting paper by imamura @xcite , who among other things showed how to construct the @xmath15 and @xmath16 representations .",
    "our treatment will focus only on the lie - algebraic issues , and we will not discuss whether the general junctions we consider have bps representatives .",
    "this is an important issue and should be studied , possibly along the lines of mikhailov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "junctions fall into equivalence classes .",
    "different members of an equivalence class represent the same physical state in different regions of the moduli space of backgrounds .",
    "the different members differ by transformations that involve strings crossing branes , creating or destroying prongs in this process @xcite .",
    "this process is u - dual to the original version of the hanany - witten effect @xcite .",
    "in addition , junctions that differ by smooth deformations are also to be considered equivalent , including the possibility of collapsing or resolving vertices",
    ". since junctions with very different presentations can be equivalent , one must first learn how to tell when junctions are equivalent .",
    "we solve this problem by introducing a set of charges @xmath17 , one for each 7-brane of the background , invariant under the operations that preserve the equivalence class of a junction .",
    "these charges can be used to construct a canonical presentation for any junction , making it manifest that two junctions are equivalent _ if and only if _ their invariant charges agree . for each brane ,",
    "the invariant charge arises from two sources , prongs ending on the brane and strings crossing the branch cut emerging from the brane .",
    "a junction may be localized around the set of seven - branes , or may have an asymptotic string ( or strings ) carrying @xmath1 charge away from the set of branes .",
    "the invariant charges allow us to think of junctions as linear combinations with integer coefficients of a set of basis strings @xmath18 . for each brane ,",
    "the associated basis string is a string departing the brane and going off to infinity without crossing any branch cut . in this way",
    "the space of ( equivalence classes of ) junctions naturally becomes a _ lattice _ over the set of basis strings .",
    "this a very important concept since it immediately gives a complete classification of all possible junctions , and helps make systematic any search for special junctions .",
    "it is important to emphasize that in each case the number of basis strings ( or branes ) exceeds the rank of the lie algebra to be generated by the background .",
    "this means that the basis of strings is not equivalent to a basis of junctions for the roots of the lie algebra . on the other hand ,",
    "the sublattice of junctions with zero asymptotic charge is in fact spanned by a number of junctions equal to the rank .",
    "motivated by the intersection invariant of homology two cycles in the f - theory ( or m - theory ) picture we introduce a symmetric bilinear form @xmath19 or metric on the junction lattice .",
    "this is a slight modification of the standard concept , since our basis strings are not homology cycles . with a little abuse of language , given a junction @xmath20",
    "we call @xmath21 the self - intersection number of the junction .",
    "super - yang - mills in ref .  @xcite . ]",
    "the metric is negative - definite for the @xmath22 series .",
    "it is degenerate for the @xmath8 series ; for the @xmath23 algebra there exist two null junctions ( junctions whose intersection with any junction vanish ) while for @xmath8 algebras with @xmath24 there is one null junction .",
    "the metric is non - degenerate but of indefinite signature for the @xmath10 series ; it has @xmath3 negative eigenvalues and two positive ones .",
    "we search the junction lattices for all inequivalent junctions with zero asymptotic charge and self - intersection @xmath25 .",
    "for each case , we find a set that is in correspondence with the set of roots of the corresponding lie algebra .",
    "we suspect that this ( simple ! ) derivation of the lie algebra from the brane configuration must somehow parallel the work involved in understanding the detailed nature of the kodaira singularities .",
    "all roots are presented as junctions , but , completing the work of @xcite we show that they all have equivalent presentations as open strings without self - crossings ( jordan open strings ) .",
    "indeed any jordan open string with endpoints at two different branes has self - intersection @xmath25 , but we are not aware of an argument that would imply that any junction of self - intersection @xmath25 must have a presentation as a jordan open string joining two different branes .",
    "it is therefore interesting to confirm that all roots of the @xmath0 algebras have jordan open string presentations .",
    "we believe this analysis improves substantially our understanding of the appearance of the adjoint representations . as usual , selecting a base of simple roots involves choices .",
    "we make a choice and exhibit junctions @xmath26 representing the simple roots of the @xmath0 algebras , confirming that their intersection numbers give rise to the appropriate cartan matrices .",
    "we define fundamental weight junctions @xmath27 dual to the simple root junctions @xmath26 , and introduce additional junctions with nonzero asymptotic charge to span the entire junction lattice .",
    "the new junctions can be thought of as additional fundamental weights @xmath28 , and allow us to develop an extended formalism .",
    "when the metric in the lattice of junctions is non - degenerate one can define dual roots @xmath29 , and the resulting extended cartan matrix is seen to be block diagonal .",
    "an arbitrary junction can be expanded using the extended set of fundamental weights ; the coefficients of the @xmath28 give the asymptotic charges , and the coefficients of the @xmath27 , we claim , are simply the dynkin labels of the associated weight vector .",
    "proving this requires further analysis of the junction lattice and its relation to the weight lattice .",
    "note that the claim implies that shifting a junction by an @xmath28 does not change its associated weight vector .",
    "we search systematically the lattices for all string junctions of self - intersection @xmath30 , which we expect to be related to fundamental representations .",
    "any jordan open string with one endpoint on a brane and the other at infinity represents a junction of self - intersection @xmath30 .",
    "again , while it may not be guaranteed , for all cases we have examined the junctions of self - intersection @xmath30 have jordan open string representatives .",
    "we then turn to the subject of obtaining general representations .",
    "even though we already have junctions @xmath27 for weights , these are not proper junctions ( except for @xmath31 ) as they require basis strings with fractional coefficients .",
    "thus , given a weight vector @xmath32 one is naively led to a junction @xmath33 which is not proper . here is where the junctions @xmath28 carrying asymptotic charges play a crucial role .",
    "they themselves are not proper , but can be added to the naive weight junction to give a proper junction representing the particular weight .",
    "more precisely , given a specific representation , one can find asymptotic charges @xmath1 such that all weights in the representation are represented by proper junctions .",
    "in addition , we show that for a given algebra , every representation in each conjugacy class can be represented by proper junctions using any one of a list of possible @xmath1 values .",
    "the @xmath1 sets associated to each conjugacy class are disjoint and together they are complete .",
    "moreover , they define an additive group ; given two sets , any sum of charges involving one element of each set falls into a unique third set . finally , the map associating conjugacy classes to @xmath1 sets is an isomorphism between the group of conjugacy classes under tensor product of representations , and the additive group of @xmath1 sets .",
    "thus we elucidate the relation between the junction lattices and the corresponding lie - algebra weight lattice .",
    "the above understanding is obtained by explicit examination of particular examples , followed by generalization .",
    "we aim to relate junction and weight lattices via a relation of the form @xmath34 , with @xmath35 the dynkin labels defining the weight vector associated to the junction with invariant charges @xmath17 .",
    "the goal here is finding the matrix @xmath36 .",
    "we give a detailed discussion for the case of the @xmath37 algebras and the case of the @xmath14 algebra .",
    "the matrix @xmath36 is partially fixed by the constraints of the adjoint representation . for the case of @xmath37",
    "the relation is completely fixed by further consideration of the fundamental representation , whose states we expect to be represented by asymptotic strings ending on the branes . in the case of @xmath14",
    "we see that the junctions of self - intersection @xmath30 fit into the @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath16 representations in a unique fashion , and this fixes the matrix @xmath36 completely .    with these examples understood in detail",
    "we notice that in fact , @xmath36 has a simple interpretation : @xmath40 is simply the intersection number between the basis string @xmath18 and the junction @xmath26 representing the root @xmath41 .",
    "this allows a nice compact expression for the dynkin labels of any junction @xmath20 : one readily finds @xmath42 .",
    "this confirms the prior claim that for a given junction , the expansion coefficients of the @xmath27 are the dynkin labels of the associated weight vector .",
    "this expression for @xmath36 is uniquely fixed by the constraint that it gives the correct assignment for the junctions belonging to the adjoint , and by the constraint that two sets of junctions with different nonvanishing asymptotic charges are correctly matched to two representations .",
    "this understanding enables us to deal quite easily with the algebras of the @xmath43 series .",
    "we also consider the reverse problem , given some dynkin labels specifying a weight vector , how do we build the corresponding junction ? here",
    "the key is that we have two extra equations .",
    "along with the dynkin labels we think of the asymptotic charges @xmath4 and @xmath5 as two more labels .",
    "the dynkin labels of the extended framework then match the number of invariant charges .",
    "the equations can then be inverted to give the invariant charges in terms of the extended dynkin labels . at this stage",
    "one can see explicitly how suitable values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are required to achieve integral invariant charges and the connection to conjugacy classes of representations becomes apparent .    before summarizing the organization of this paper we touch on a couple of issues that were somewhat puzzling in @xcite .",
    "we wondered at that time what was the precise lie - algebraic counterpart of the combining of junctions .",
    "the answer is now clear , combination of junctions is simply addition of the corresponding lattice vectors , and therefore equivalent to addition of the corresponding weight vectors .",
    "it is also clear that while junctions associated to roots can always be combined , the result need not be a root .",
    "another point was the following : for the @xmath44 algebra the brane arrangement involved @xmath3 @xmath45-branes , one @xmath46-brane and two @xmath47-branes . on the other hand",
    "the maximal subalgebra of @xmath44 of a similar type is @xmath48 .",
    "this is a little surprising since given the number and types of branes present one would have naively expected a @xmath49 algebra . thus out of three @xmath50 s two are not realized .",
    "those @xmath50 charges are two linear combinations of invariant charges under which no @xmath44 root can be charged .",
    "it is clear that these must simply be the @xmath4 and @xmath5 charges , expressed in terms of the invariant charges .",
    "we wondered in @xcite how one could read the surviving @xmath50 charge from the picture of the junction .",
    "the answer follows from our results , and for convenience we discuss it in an appendix . given a junction ,",
    "we have already shown how to find its dynkin labels for @xmath44 , it then takes a routine lie - algebraic computation to derive the dynkin weights of subalgebras . in this way",
    "one can tell precisely which combination of invariant charges gives the @xmath50 charge in the @xmath48 subalgebra .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we define invariant charges , introduce the canonical presentation of junctions and the basis of strings . in section 3 we introduce a symmetric bilinear intersection form and discuss self - intersection numbers for junctions . after reviewing briefly some basics of representation theory",
    ", we prove that the inequivalent junctions with zero asymptotic charge and self - intersection @xmath25 are in correspondance with the roots of the enhanced symmetry algebra . in section 4",
    "we introduce fundamental weight junctions and the extended formalism . in section 5",
    "we search for all junctions of self - intersection @xmath30 . in section 6",
    "we show how to relate dynkin labels to invariant charges by discussing explicitly @xmath37 , @xmath14 and @xmath9 . in section 7",
    "we establish the relation between the junction and weight lattices , and discuss the @xmath43 series .",
    "finally in section 8 we offer some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we discuss the equivalence classes of junctions .",
    "two junctions are considered equivalent if they can be related by _",
    "junction transformations_. these transformations are of two types : moving pieces of the junction across branes , and continuous deformations of the junction consistent with charge conservation .",
    "the operation of brane crossing , the presently relevant version of the hanany - witten effect  @xcite , can create or destroy string prongs @xcite .",
    "the continuous deformations of a junction include the possibility of coalescing junction points ( see also @xcite ) . our strategy for the classification of junctions will be the following .",
    "we will recognize a set of invariants , the invariant charges , associated to a junction .",
    "we will then explain how any string junction can be given a _",
    "canonical presentation _ determined uniquely by , and in one to one correspondance with the invariant charges .",
    "this will prove that the invariant charges characterize completely the equivalence classes of junctions .",
    "we will be led to define a basis of junctions comprised by strings , and general junctions will be viewed as points in a lattice whose generating vectors are the basis strings .",
    "the invariants associated to a junction will be a set of charges , one for each 7-brane in the background .",
    "our intuition about charges is that a junction may be charged under the gauge field associated to a particular brane either if it has a prong on the brane , or if it crosses the branch cut associated to the brane . for each brane ,",
    "the invariant is simply the charge which combines the two possible contributions so that the charge is unchanged when the junction is modified by crossing transformations .",
    "such charges exist because crossing transformations are indeed constrained by charge conservation @xcite .    consider a junction @xmath51 and let @xmath52 index the various branes in the configuration .",
    "let @xmath53 $ ] denote the labels of a brane , and let @xmath54 denote the branch cut emerging from the brane and oriented away from it .",
    "we now claim that the junction has an invariant charge @xmath55 associated to the @xmath52 brane given by @xmath56 in the above expression , @xmath57 is the number of @xmath58 prongs departing from the brane , and @xmath59 is the number of @xmath58 prongs ending on the brane .",
    "moreover , @xmath60 , an integer greater than or equal to zero , denotes the number of intersections of @xmath20 with the branch cut @xmath61 . finally , @xmath62 is the charges of the string belonging to @xmath20 that crosses the cut at the @xmath63-th intersection point , in a counterclockwise direction .",
    "@xmath64    let us now confirm this is the correct formula .",
    "the @xmath65 term in eqn .",
    "( [ invch ] ) gives the net number of outgoing prongs at the brane .",
    "in addition , the @xmath63-th term in the sum equals the number of outgoing @xmath58 prongs that the @xmath62 string would generate via the hanany - witten effect were it moved through the brane , so that it no longer crosses the branch cut .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ stringcrosscut ] , upon crossing the branch cut @xmath54 in the counterclockwise direction , the @xmath62 string turns into the @xmath66 string where @xcite @xmath67 and indeed @xmath68 this confirms that the @xmath62 piece of junction can be moved across the @xmath52 brane to a position where it does not intersect @xmath54 , by adding @xmath69 _ outgoing _ prongs at @xmath52 that reach the newly located piece of junction .",
    "similarly , a string in the junction that does not intersect @xmath54 could be moved across the brane , creating in the process a number of prongs . in",
    "can be readily verified that in this case eqn .",
    "( [ invch ] ) would give two canceling contributions .",
    "note in particular that a crossing transformation may give rise to more than one prong .",
    "equation ( [ invch ] ) shows that the contributions from the cut @xmath54 only depend on the total @xmath1 charge being transported across it .",
    "as we deform @xmath54 continuously , the @xmath1 charge transported across it will not change .",
    "this is clearly true even as we cross junction points since charge is conserved at these points .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath17 charge defined above is invariant under deformations of the cut @xmath54 , as long as the deformation does not require that the @xmath54 cut cross another 7-brane .",
    "the above discussion of invariant charges suggests how to define a canonical presentation for any junction .",
    "the idea is to transform any given junction into an equivalent junction that does not intersect any branch cut .",
    "this is clearly possible since any specific intersection with a branch cut can be transformed away at the cost of introducing some prongs , and this can be done with every intersection .    before doing this in detail",
    "we emphasize that we also present the branes in a canonical fashion . following the conventions of @xcite we use three types of branes , a - branes , b - branes and c - branes . in our pictures , from left to right a - branes appear first , then b - branes and finally c - branes .",
    "all branes have their cuts going downwards vertically .",
    "a - branes are represented by heavy dots , b - branes by empty circles , and c - branes by empty squares ( see fig .  [ canonpres ] ) .",
    "our conventions for monodromies are those of @xcite : @xmath70 : \\,\\,k_a = & m_{1,0}^{-1 } = t^{-1 } =   \\pmatrix{1 & -1 \\cr 0 & 1 } \\",

    "consider , for example , the junction shown in fig .",
    "[ canonpres](a ) .",
    "after transformation the junction will look as in fig .",
    "[ canonpres](b ) . at every brane",
    "there is a set of prongs that converge towards a region where there could be a complicated graph .",
    "finally , there can be an outgoing string carrying he total charge of the configuration .",
    "now we can allow the length of all the strings in the complicated region to approach zero , reducing the graph to a single junction point where all the prongs emerging from the various branes meet , as shown in fig .",
    "[ canonpres](c ) .",
    "this configuration could be taken as the canonical presentation but , for convenience , we will do a further step by introducing sub - junction points .",
    "all prongs of the leftmost set of mutually local branes will join together forming a single string which is then joined by the string resulting from the prongs of the second set of mutually local branes , and so on . this is shown in fig .  [ canonpres](d ) .",
    "we will call this the canonical presentation . by construction ,",
    "any junction is equivalent to its canonical presentation . as emphasized before",
    ", we do not address the issue of whether any the junction has a bps representative .",
    "furthermore , if it has one , it need not be the junction in the canonical presentation .",
    "@xmath73    note that the canonical presentation is determined _ uniquely _ by the invariant charges that characterize the junction .",
    "in fact , the invariant charge for any brane is precisely the number of outgoing prongs in the canonical presentation .",
    "it follows that any two junctions with the same invariant charges are equivalent because each is equivalent to the same canonical presentation .",
    "moreover , since the charges can not be changed by the allowed transformations , two junctions with different charges are necessarily inequivalent .",
    "all in all , the invariant charges give a complete classification of all possible equivalence classes of junctions .",
    "the canonical presentation suggests a natural way of building junctions using a basis of _ strings_.",
    "let us label the branes using an index @xmath74 , where @xmath3 is the total number of branes in the configuration .",
    "for a brane with label @xmath52 and of type @xmath53 $ ] , we define the string @xmath18 as the outgoing @xmath75 string starting at the brane and going off to infinity without crossing any branch cut .",
    "this is a very special and simple junction , with invariant charges @xmath76 the string @xmath77 is the same string with reversed orientation .",
    "let us define what is meant by adding junctions .",
    "given two junctions @xmath78 and @xmath79 , we say that @xmath80 is the junction with charges @xmath81 for all branes @xmath52 in the set of branes .",
    "in other words , we simply add the prongs in the canonical presentation .",
    "this operation is illustrated for two special examples in fig .",
    "[ twojunctions ] . in the first example",
    "we show the addition @xmath82 of two mutually nonlocal strings .",
    "note that in the canonical presentation this is a three string junction with outgoing prongs at the @xmath45 and @xmath46 branes and one outgoing string carrying the total charge @xmath83 . in the second example we consider @xmath84 where @xmath45 and @xmath85 denote two branes of the same type .",
    "this time when we form the canonical presentation for the sum the total outgoing charge vanishes .",
    "this junction is simply a string departing from the @xmath45 brane and ending on the @xmath85 brane .",
    "@xmath86    it follows from these considerations that any junction @xmath20 can be written as a sum of basis strings , where the expansion coefficients are the invariant charges .",
    "we have @xmath87 which is clearly in agreement with equation ( [ addjunction ] ) by virtue of eq .",
    "( [ basisst ] ) . since the charges @xmath17 must be integers",
    ", we have a _ lattice of junctions _",
    ", with the set of basis strings serving as basis vectors .",
    "each point in this lattice represents an equivalence class of junctions .",
    "since each seven - brane of the background provides a basis string , the dimensionality of the junction lattice equals the number of seven - branes .    as we proceed in our exploration of the lattice of junctions",
    ", we will need objects having non - integral expansion coefficients in the basis of strings .",
    "these we shall call _ improper junctions _ , to distinguish them from the proper junctions which can correspond to physical states .",
    "in this section we consider some additional structure on the lattice of junctions .",
    "we will introduce a symmetric bilinear form @xmath88 , _",
    "i.e. _ an inner product , or a metric",
    ". we will define this inner product by giving all inner products of basis strings .",
    "this inner product will be sometimes referred to as an intersection bilinear , since it originates from the intersection bilinear on the two - dimensional submanifolds of @xmath89 which are the f - theory ( or m - theory ) lifts of the junctions .",
    "the discussion presented here focuses on the junctions and not on their lifts .",
    "we will call @xmath90 the self - intersection invariant of the junction @xmath20 .",
    "the relevance of the metric in the junction lattice is that it is related to the metric in weight lattice of the associated lie algebra .",
    "some of this relation will be explored in this section .",
    "a related discussion of self - intersection with a different application in mind was given in @xcite .",
    "after a brief review of the relevant notions in lie algebras , we show how to identify the roots of the algebra for the various brane configurations . using the intersection bilinear",
    "we can readily show that the inequivalent junctions of self - intersection @xmath25 are equal in number to the roots of the expected lie algebra .",
    "the junctions ( or strings ) corresponding to simple roots are easily identified in each case .    since all roots are represented by junctions of self - intersection @xmath25 , which is also the self - intersection number of any jordan open string joining two different branes , we are led to hypothesize that all roots of the @xmath91 series of algebras have presentations as jordan open strings .",
    "many of these were known previously @xcite , except for a class of roots in @xmath92 and another class in @xmath31 .",
    "we construct explicitly jordan open strings representing these roots , thus confirming the hypothesis .",
    "the intersection bilinear , defined on the equivalence classes of junctions , will be deduced by starting with an initial assignment for the self - intersection of basis strings , and then exploring the implications of bilinearity and invariance under junction transformations .",
    "we declare the self - intersection of any basis string @xmath93 to be minus one , @xmath94 to find out the value we ought to assign to the self - intersection of a three string junction , we can consider ( as in the previous section ) an @xmath95 string crossing the cut of a @xmath6 $ ] brane . in this configuration",
    "the string clearly has no self - intersection .",
    "if we move the string through the brane , it no longer crosses the cut but we obtain prongs beginning on the brane and ending on the string , forming some equivalent junction . since we expect the self - intersection to be invariant under junction transformations , the various contributions must cancel .",
    "the contribution from the prongs is @xmath96 $ ] , where @xmath97 is the number of prongs emerging from the brane ( see eq .",
    "( [ confirmhw ] ) ) . to cancel this",
    "we must have a contribution to the self - intersection arising from the junction point as follows .",
    "consider the three string junction @xmath98 defined as the joining of @xmath99 strings , with @xmath100 , where all strings are ingoing ( or outgoing ) and the label @xmath101 increases ( cyclically ) as we go around the junction in the counterclockwise direction .",
    "then the contribution to the self - intersection from the junction point is given as @xmath102 this result is independent of @xmath101 ( with @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) and can be readily verified to be invariant under @xmath105 transformations of all the strings making up the junction .",

    "the reader may recognize that these transformations are nothing else than the transformation ( [ chla ] ) generated by @xmath328 and @xmath329 given in ( [ nullj ] ) . in the next section we will see that these junctions do not change dynkin labels since they have zero intersection number with the roots . given a @xmath559 dyon we can therefore soak the asymptotic charge @xmath568 necessary to reduce it to one of the four canonical asymptotic charges via a transformation of the form ( [ nullj ] ) .",
    "the conjugacy classes of @xmath14 are labeled by two integers ( mod 2 ) : @xmath569 it follows from ( [ aso8 ] ) that @xmath570 the condition that the invariant charges must be integers requires @xmath571 ( mod 2 ) , and @xmath572 ( mod 2 ) , and using ( [ so8con ] ) we have",
    "@xmath573 this shows that the conjugacy class of an @xmath14 representation determines the required asymptotic @xmath559 charge mod 2 .",
    "the representation can be constructed by junctions of any fixed asymptotic charge satisfying the mod 2 condition .",
    "this is analogous to the situation for @xmath37 , where the conjugacy class determined the possible values of @xmath574 .",
    "the above equation implies that @xmath575 are related as follows @xmath576 which can be checked to be consistent with the results of ( [ gotrep ] ) for the @xmath541 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath16 representations .    note that conjugacy classes of representations form a group under tensor product of representations .",
    "indeed , in the present example , if we take any representation of the conjugacy class @xmath577 and we tensor it with any representation in the conjugacy class @xmath578 the result is a series of representations all of which belong to the conjugacy class @xmath579 ( mod 2 )",
    ". thus conjugacy classes of representations combine according to the group @xmath580 .",
    "the above result associates to each conjugacy class of representations an equivalence class of possible @xmath1 asymptotic charges .",
    "since multiplication of representations implies addition of asymptotic charges for the corresponding junctions , consistency requires that the map from conjugacy classes to equivalence classes of @xmath1 charges define a homomorphism from the group of conjugacy classes to a group generated by the equivalence classes of asymptotic charges under addition .",
    "note that for our particular example we actually have an isomorphism of groups .",
    "the construction of @xmath14 generalizes readily to the case of @xmath581 , with the slight complication that the conjugacy classes are different for @xmath3 odd than for @xmath3 even .",
    "since the analysis is so similar to that of @xmath14 , we directly give the result expressing dynkin labels in terms of invariant charges :    @xmath582    the @xmath50 charge is given by @xmath583 when @xmath3 is even one may insert a factor of @xmath584 to the definition of @xmath585 to normalize the smallest value of @xmath585 to unity .",
    "solving for the invariant charges we find @xmath586 these equations will place constraints on the asymptotic charges differently for @xmath3 even and @xmath3 odd .",
    "this is consistent with the different conjugacy classes of @xmath9 for @xmath3 even and @xmath3 odd . for @xmath3",
    "even , the group of conjugacy classes is @xmath580 , as given by @xmath587 which generalizes ( [ conjso8 ] ) .",
    "one can readily check that the constraints on the asymptotic charges are still given by ( [ pqconjso8 ] ) , ( [ ccpqso8 ] ) .    for @xmath3 odd , the situation is more complicated .",
    "conjugacy is @xmath588 , given by @xmath589 unlike the case for @xmath3 even , the quantity @xmath590 is not independent , but is determined by the value of @xmath591 .",
    "however , we still find it useful to define since it characterizes the constraint on the asymptotic charges .",
    "we see that ( [ qaso2n ] ) requires @xmath592 however , in ( [ qbso2n ] ) and ( [ qcso2n ] ) it is the value of @xmath5 ( mod 4 ) that is relevant .",
    "thus @xmath593 ( mod 4 ) and @xmath594 ( mod 4 ) will correspond to different conjugacy classes .",
    "the value of @xmath4 in turn changes to compensate for the different value of @xmath5 , but since only @xmath595 appears , @xmath4 is only determined ( mod 2 ) .",
    "the relationship is @xmath596 this corresponds to the following map between conjugacy ( given by @xmath591 ) and asymptotic charges , ( mod 2 ) for @xmath4 and ( mod 4 ) for @xmath5 : @xmath597",
    "in previous section , we considered the @xmath22 and @xmath8 algebras and derived the formula giving the dynkin labels associated to arbitrary junctions by explicit examination of certain representations .",
    "the formula ( [ afromq ] ) requires finding the matrix @xmath36 .",
    "we showed that @xmath36 is fixed by requiring the the expected dynkin labels for the root junctions and for the junctions of self - intersection is@xmath30 . in this section",
    "we will find a simple explanation for this fact using the intersection matrix .",
    "( [ afromq ] ) will be reinterpreted @xmath598 .",
    "we will show that proving this requires , in general , examination of at least two representations that have nontrivial asymptotic charges .",
    "this better understanding of the relation between junction and weight lattices will allow us to complete the discussion of the exceptional algebras .",
    "additionally , we solve for the invariant charges in terms of @xmath599 , and show that in each case , the conjugacy class of the algebra places restrictions on the asymptotic charges .      to begin with ,",
    "let us find the constraints on the matrix @xmath36 arising from the root junctions .",
    "observe that the cartan matrix , giving the dynkin labels of the simple roots , is realized geometrically as the intersection of simple roots : @xmath600 where we also made use of ( [ afromq ] ) for the case of the adjoint .",
    "if we expand @xmath505 in the basis of strings we find @xmath601 and from the last two equations we deduce that @xmath602 to find the general solution of the above equation consider the set of vectors associated to all simple roots : @xmath603 .",
    "let @xmath604 be a basis for a set of vectors orthogonal to all of the @xmath605 vectors , namely @xmath606 for all @xmath607 and @xmath608 .",
    "then the general solution of ( [ findk ] ) is @xmath609 the simplest solution is therefore @xmath610 if we take this to be the correct value for the matrix @xmath36 we can now find a simple expression for the dynkin labels of junctions .",
    "we have @xmath611 showing that the dynkin labels of the weight associated to any junction are determined by its intersection with junctions associated to the simple roots .",
    "this is exactly the result we said we would prove in ( [ hui ] ) .",
    "it was said then that the constants @xmath35 in ( [ jexp ] ) are indeed the dynkin labels of the associated weight vector .",
    "we now explain why ( [ solsol ] ) is the correct solution .",
    "assume we have a set of junctions @xmath612 all of which have the same asymptotic charges @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , assume we have another set of junctions @xmath613 all of which have asymptotic charge @xmath415 .",
    "assume further that both @xmath1 and @xmath415 are not identically zero , nor proportional to each other .",
    "finally , assume ( [ solsol ] ) identifies correctly these two sets of junctions to two representations .",
    "under these circumstances , we will show that ( [ simsol ] ) is the only possible solution .",
    "assume that @xmath614 maps correctly the junctions @xmath615 to the full set of weight vectors @xmath616 of a specific representation @xmath617 .",
    "note that from ( [ gensol ] ) it follows that @xmath618 we now claim that there are two vectors @xmath619 satisfying the required orthogonality condition ( [ exiu ] ) .",
    "these are the vectors @xmath620 and @xmath621 satisfying for arbitrary junctions @xmath622 since root junctions have zero asymptotic charges the requisite conditions ( [ exiu ] ) are satisfied . now",
    "( [ getrid ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath623 the important thing to note here is that since all junctions have the same asymptotic charges all weight vectors @xmath624 are shifted by the same vector @xmath625 ; namely @xmath626 where @xmath627 since the set of weights of any ( irreducible ) representation @xmath617 can not be invariant under translations we conclude that @xmath628 . because the fundamental weights @xmath629 form a basis ,",
    "if @xmath628 then @xmath630 similarly , the second set of junctions would require @xmath631 since we assumed that the @xmath1 and @xmath415 values are nonzero and not proportional , this implies that the constants @xmath632 and @xmath633 vanish identically .",
    "this concludes our proof .",
    "the above discussion is in agreement with our experience in the previous section . for the @xmath8 algebras we had to examine two sets of junctions with non - vanishing asymptotic charges to fix the matrix @xmath36 ( for the case of @xmath22 algebras ,",
    "as usual , one representation sufficed ) .",
    "we now verify that our previous results for @xmath37 and @xmath14 follow directly from ( [ solsol ] ) .",
    "consider first @xmath37 , and examine @xmath634 .",
    "since @xmath635 , the formula gets contributions only from @xmath636 , reproducing @xmath637 .    in a similar fashion",
    "we can confirm our results for @xmath14 .",
    "the simple roots are given in ( [ sonsimple ] ) @xmath638 for @xmath100 we find @xmath639 since the @xmath119 and @xmath533 strings have zero intersection with the first three root junctions .",
    "we then get @xmath640 and the only nontrivial terms are @xmath641 reproducing ( [ aso8 ] ) .",
    "the case of @xmath9 proceeds along the same lines .",
    "looking for junctions of self - intersection @xmath30 for the exceptional algebras , we found sets of 27 , 56 and 240 junctions for @xmath137 , @xmath92 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "how can we confirm that ( [ solsol ] ) associates these junctions precisely to the weight vectors of the @xmath443 , the @xmath405 , and to the non - zero weights of the @xmath444 ?",
    "we claim that it is sufficient to prove that for each case one junction maps to a weight vector of the representation in question",
    ". this will be simple to show , given that all weights of @xmath443 , all weights of the @xmath405 , and all non - zero weights of the @xmath444 have the same length , and no weight appears more than once in the representations .",
    "series , as well as for the @xmath446 of @xmath137 .",
    "we thank v. kac for bringing these facts to our attention . ]",
    "focus on one of the algebras and the set of @xmath30 self - intersection junctions that we wish to show is associated to a representation @xmath642 .",
    "assume there is a junction @xmath20 in the set that maps to a weight vector @xmath643 in @xmath642 .",
    "let @xmath644 be a simple root that can be added to @xmath643 to get another weight vector @xmath645 in @xmath642 .",
    "the linearity of ( [ solsol ] ) implies that @xmath646 is mapped to @xmath647 .",
    "we now want to show that @xmath131 and @xmath20 have the same self - intersection .",
    "recall that assuming ( [ solsol ] ) we showed that the self - intersection of a junction @xmath20 is related to the length squared of its associated weight vector by @xmath648 where @xmath649 is a quadratic form in the asymptotic charges , as ( [ relcone6 ] ) , ( [ relcone7 ] ) , ( [ relcone8 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath650 has zero asymptotic charge , @xmath20 and @xmath131 have the same asymptotic charges and @xmath651 thus as long as @xmath647 has the same length as @xmath643 , @xmath131 has the same self - intersection as @xmath20 .",
    "the claim now follows easily . starting with any weight produced by a junction , we can by the process of adding or subtracting simple roots",
    "reach every weight in the representation @xmath642 . in the case of @xmath137 and @xmath92 , for each such weight we find a junction of self - intersection @xmath30 mapping to it . since no weight appears more than once we produce a set of dim@xmath652 different junctions of self - intersection @xmath30 that give correct dynkin labels .",
    "since , by assumption , there are precisely dim@xmath652 junctions of self - intersection @xmath30 for the given values of @xmath1 the set of junctions produced by the iterative procedure must coincide with the junctions we found in the lattice . for the case of",
    "@xmath31 we note that the 240 nonzero weights break into two groups , the positive roots and the negative roots .",
    "all positive roots can be obtained from a positive root by adding and subtracting simple roots , and the same holds for the negative roots .",
    "if we have a junction mapping to a positive root , minus that junction will map to the corresponding negative root . the above argument then can be applied to the two sets separately .",
    "this concludes our proof .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of each exceptional algebra individually .",
    "the simple roots of @xmath137 are given in ( [ simpe6 ] ) .",
    "compared to @xmath14 , there is now an additional a brane and an additional c brane .",
    "the roots like @xmath653 produce cancellations and give @xmath654 as before .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath655 , and obtain @xmath656 .",
    "finally , @xmath657 is analogous to @xmath657 of @xmath14 .",
    "we find @xmath658 we invert the matrix @xmath36 to find for the invariant charges @xmath659 again the condition that @xmath660 requires that the charges of a junction be determined by the conjugacy class of the representation .",
    "@xmath137 has @xmath661 conjugacy determined by the quantity @xmath662 and we see that we must have @xmath663    the highest weight vector of the @xmath443 has dynkin labels @xmath664 . using ( [ e6dynkin ] ) , one can check that the junction @xmath528 , present in the set of 27 junctions of self - intersection @xmath30 , maps to this weight vector .",
    "hence this set of 27 junctions with asymptotic charge @xmath291 is associated to a @xmath443 .",
    "additionally , we can use the transformation ( [ e6shift ] ) to produce another @xmath443 , with asymptotic charges @xmath366 . since ( [ solsol ] ) successfully identifies these two sets of junctions with @xmath1 not proportional , by our previous arguments it is the only solution for @xmath137 .",
    "the simple roots of @xmath92 are given in eqn .",
    "( [ simpe7 ] ) .",
    "there is one more a - brane than in @xmath137 .",
    "the roots have the same basic structure , and similar calculations lead us to the result @xmath665 as we did for @xmath137 , we can invert @xmath36 to find @xmath666 @xmath92 has @xmath667 conjugacy , given by @xmath668 and indeed we see for the invariant charges to be integral we require @xmath669    the highest weight of the @xmath405 has dynkin labels @xmath670 . as one can verify using ( [ e7dynkin ] ) , the junction @xmath671 with asymptotic charges @xmath291 , maps to this weight vector .",
    "this junction is among the set of 56 with self - intersection @xmath30 , and implies that this set is identified with the @xmath405 .",
    "( [ e7shift ] ) can be used to produce another @xmath405 with asymptotic charges @xmath455 , and these two representations together establish that ( [ solsol ] ) is the only solution for @xmath92 as well .",
    "the simple roots of @xmath31 are given in eqn .",
    "( [ simpe8 ] ) .",
    "there is now a total of 7 a - branes .",
    "almost identical calculations give @xmath672 again we can invert @xmath36 , to obtain for the invariant charges @xmath673 @xmath31 has just one conjugacy class , and accordingly , there is no condition on the asymptotic charges .    as discussed before ,",
    "there are 240 junctions with asymptotic charge @xmath291 and self - intersection @xmath30 .",
    "one of these corresponds to the highest weight @xmath674 , @xmath675 and following our earlier arguments this is sufficient to establish that these junctions are associated to the weights of the @xmath444 with non - zero length .",
    "since the roots of @xmath31 have length squared 2 and the cartan generators have zero length squared , by ( [ jfromlambda ] ) we expect the remaining 8 weights to be associated to a junction with self - intersection @xmath445 .",
    "the common weight vector has vanishing dynkin labels , which requires @xmath676 , @xmath677 , and @xmath678 furthermore we have for general asymptotic charges @xmath679 there is a unique solution for each @xmath1 . for our case of @xmath291",
    "we find @xmath680 one can readily check that the self - intersection of this junction is indeed @xmath445 .    using ( [ e8shift ] )",
    "we can produce another @xmath444 , this one with asymptotic charges @xmath455 , and can use this @xmath444 together with the previous one to establish that ( [ solsol ] ) is the only possible relation for @xmath31 .",
    "thus we have proved that ( [ solsol ] ) is the unique solution for all simply laced lie algebras .",
    "in this paper we have examined the lie algebra representations arising from string junctions ending on a background of branes . on the space of junctions",
    "we have defined equivalence classes .",
    "two junctions belong to the same class if they can be transformed into each other by brane crossings and continuous deformations .",
    "each equivalence class has a canonical representative , where the junction does not cross the branch cut of any brane .",
    "the space of equivalence classes has the structure of a lattice , with generators called basis strings .",
    "a general equivalence class is constructed by integer linear combinations of basis strings .",
    "this lattice is equipped with a metric , _",
    "i.e. _ a bilinear symmetric inner product , arising from intersection invariants .",
    "this metric is positive definite for the @xmath22 series , degenerate for the @xmath8 series , and nondegenerate but indefinite for the @xmath10 series .",
    "additionally , we have elucidated the relation between the lattice of junctions on this background , and the weight lattice of the lie algebra . for the @xmath22 series",
    "the junction lattice has one more dimension than the weight lattice , while for the @xmath8 and @xmath10 series the junction lattice has two more dimensions than the corresponding weight lattice . in these latter cases ,",
    "a choice of asymptotic @xmath1 charges selects a junction sub - lattice of codimension two which can be identified with the weight lattice of one conjugacy class of representations of the algebra . a given weight vector in this conjugacy class is thus represented as a junction with the chosen @xmath1 .",
    "for any specific conjugacy class , the weight sub - lattice can actually be identified with a set of @xmath1 junction sub - lattices .",
    "the set of @xmath1 values associated to each conjugacy class defines an equivalence class ; this association being an isomorphism between the group of conjugacy classes and the group of @xmath1 equivalence classes under addition . the conjugacy class of the adjoint maps to the equivalence class containing the asymptotic charge @xmath365 .",
    "not only are junction and weight lattices related , but their metrics are related as well .",
    "the identification of the @xmath365 junction sub - lattice to the root lattice maps one metric into the other .",
    "for other @xmath1 sublattices the two metrics differ by a quadratic form in @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , just as the dynkin labels of a given weight are found by inner product with the simple roots , they are also given by the inner product of the associated junction with the @xmath365 junctions representing the simple roots .",
    "it is useful to think of the entire junction space as isomorphic to an extended weight lattice , with additional fundamental weights associated to the asymptotic charges .",
    "the additional weights are also related to the @xmath50 generators of the configuration that are not part of the enhanced gauge algebra .",
    "important questions remain .",
    "a full systematic analysis of the junction lattice , giving for example the states and representations for every possible intersection number , is missing .",
    "while in the standard weight lattice a given weight vector can appear in an arbitrary number of representations , one feels that the junction lattice , having more room in it , could organize states and representations in a less degenerate way .",
    "note that the junction lattice is in some sense more basic than the lattice of homology classes of surfaces , the familiar object typically used to see the emergence of lie algebras ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a basis string , when lifted to the elliptic fiber , is essentially half of a two - sphere .",
    "we have not explored @xmath681-theory or @xmath682-theory viewpoints , nor attempted to relate our work to the geometrical engineering program @xcite . the significance of the extended root system is not completely clear . as presently formulated , the extended cartan matrix is block diagonal with zero inner product between the new and old simple roots .",
    "there may be other relevant constructions .",
    "our work has been largely lie - algebraic , and has not concentrated on the string - theoretic realization of a junction . in particular ,",
    "we have not attempted to determine which representations of a given symmetry algebra have associated bps junctions . while non - bps stable junctions are also of interest @xcite ,",
    "bps states are easily identified in the string spectrum and a full understanding of their properties should be feasible .",
    "it is known that two different holomorphic submanifolds must have a non - negative intersection number ( see , for example @xcite ) ; this condition , used in @xcite , could be of help in the present context as well .",
    "if a given representation is known to be realizable by bps junctions , it remains to be shown that each state is uniquely realized by one and only one representative in the corresponding equivalence class of junctions for given values of the moduli .",
    "these ideas could be relevant to elucidate the physics of @xmath13 four dimensional theories with exceptional flavor symmetries .    by giving the general relation between junctions and weight vectors we have made precise and extended in a significant way the usual picture of open strings stretched between branes as representing particular generators of a gauge algebra .",
    "perhaps our methods will find further applications in other settings , and help find generalized brane constructions giving more exotic gauge algebras and representations .",
    ".4 in      we would like to thank to t. hauer and a. iqbal for many illuminating discussions .",
