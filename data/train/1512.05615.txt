    "turbulent flows typically exhibit enhanced transport , mixing and/or dissipation compared to steady flows , but an accurate characterization of their properties is challenging due to their dynamic complexity . given the computational cost of full numerical simulations in highly turbulent regimes and the absence of closed - form solutions to the navier  stokes equations , a common approach is to derive rigorous bounds for key turbulent properties ( e.g. dissipation , transport , etc . ) as a function of the forcing parameters ( e.g. reynolds number , boundary conditions , body forces , etc . ) .    among other techniques , the _ background method _",

    "a particular challenge in these computations comes from flows subject to imposed boundary fluxes ( neumann bcs ) or mixed dirichlet ",

    "our results suggest that flows driven by a shear stress are similar to those driven by a body force in a narrow region near the upper surface also in terms of their energy dissipation rate  at least when described by bounds on the dissipation coefficient .",
    "this is not surprising , since the background method , used to formulate the bounding problem for @xmath6 , can be seen as a generalization of energy stability theory .",
    "the techniques used to compute the optimal background fields can also be applied directly to determine the energy stability boundaries of the laminar couette flow .",
    "the critical grashoff number @xmath227 at which the solution is no longer energy stable is given by the maximization problem  @xcite @xmath228 where the spectral constraint is imposed over all horizontally - periodic , time - independent , incompressible velocity fields @xmath35 that satisfy the bcs in  .",
    "the constraint can be relaxed as a combination of lmis and linear inequalities using ides similar to those in sections  [ s:2dbounds][s:3dbounds ] , and   can be formulated as an sdp with one decision variable .",
    "the critical grashoff @xmath227 can then be computed extremely efficiently , making semidefinite programming an attractive alternative to the traditional discretization of the boundary - eigenvalue problem associated with  .",
    "figures  [ f : enstab2d ] and  [ f : enstab3d ] show @xmath227 for the two and three dimensional flows as a function of the domain aspect ratios @xmath23 and @xmath24 . as in section  [ s:3dbounds ] , we have assumed that the critical modes for the three dimensional flow are independent of the streamwise direction ; this assumption is not necessary , but significantly simplifies the formulation of the sdp and reduces its computational cost .",
    "the figures also illustrate the neutral curves for each individual fourier mode , which can be easily computed by considering only a single fourier mode in the sdp .",
    "note that , as one would expect , all pairs @xmath229 achieving the same @xmath227 correspond to the same wavenumber @xmath230 ( respectively , @xmath231 and @xmath232 for the three dimensional flow ) .",
    "in particular , the local minima correspond to @xmath233 and @xmath234 for the two and three dimensional flows respectively , in excellent agreement with the results of  @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , our results represent _ lower bounds _ on @xmath227 that account for the effect of all orthogonal modes of the velocity field , because the imposed lmis are stronger conditions than the spectral constraint in  .",
    "however , the optimal @xmath8 computed with our sdp formulation converges ( from below ) to the exact @xmath227 as the number of legendre coefficients in the expansions of @xmath1 is increased .",
    "in fact , we obtained well converged results considering as few as 15 legendre coefficients .",
    "this is confirmed by the figures : our results agree extremely well with those obtained with traditional methods  @xcite ( these reference results were computed treating the fourier wavenumber as a continuous variable and hence correspond to the limit of infinite aspect ratio ) .",
    "using a novel numerical technique , we have computed near - optimal bounds on the dissipation coefficient for two and three dimensional shear flows driven by a surface stress . to our knowledge , this is the first time that near - optimal bounds are determined for flows with imposed boundary fluxes ; previous attempts have only considered piecewise linear fields ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "our numerical results improve previous analytical bounds by more than 10 times at large @xmath8 , and agree with the approximate computations carried out by tang  _ et al _  @xcite .",
    "this confirms that flows driven by a surface stress are similar to those driven by a localized body force not only in terms of their energy stability boundaries  @xcite , but also as far as bounds on the dissipation coefficient are concerned .",
    "while our bounds have been obtained considering a restricted class of background fields , we expect that no significant further improvements can be achieved by other numerical techniques and , in practice , our results can be considered optimal . yet , it should be recognized that our bounds are only optimal within the variational formulation proposed by hagstrom&doering  @xcite .",
    "in fact , as suggested by tang  _ et al_.  @xcite , it is unlikely that our bounds are achieved by any real flow .",
    "it is therefore of future interest to compare our bounds to scaling laws estimated via numerical simulations or experiments of the flow at high @xmath8 ( not available at the time of writing ) .",
    "finally , we emphasize the central role played by our numerical approach , which allowed us to avoid the technical complications that affect the classical variational framework when fixed - flux bcs must be imposed . although the computational challenges related to the solution of sdps at large @xmath8 prevented us from reaching the asymptotic regime and estimating accurate scaling laws , the formulation of sdps is generally attractive for the following two reasons .",
    "first , sdp relaxations can be derived systematically for a wide range of problems  @xcite , not only of the type studied in this work .",
    "for instance , we have demonstrated that sdps provide an efficient alternative to traditional methods , based on the solution of boundary - eigenvalue problems , in the context of energy stability .",
    "second , the sdp is formulated in a rigorous manner , meaning that its feasible region corresponds to a set that is contained within the feasible set of the original infinite dimensional bounding problem . while the bounds presented in this work can not be considered analytic results due to the numerical roundoff errors in the solution of the sdps , the rigorous formulation of a finite dimensional problem represents a first step towards the construction of a fully computer - assisted proof of near - optimal bounds . for these reasons",
    ", we expect that if the technical difficulties related to solving sdps in the asymptotic regime can be overcome by future work , semidefinite programming will provide a robust framework to solve bounding problems across a wide range of contexts .",
    "let @xmath235 be defined for @xmath236 $ ] .",
    "we assume that @xmath151 has enough regularity such that @xmath152 has a uniformly convergent legendre expansion ; for example , assume that @xmath151 is twice continuously differentiable  @xcite . under the assumption of uniform convergence",
    ", the legendre series @xmath237 can be related using the fundamental theorem of calculus and the fact that @xmath238\\ ] ] for all @xmath239  @xcite .",
    "in fact , recalling that @xmath240 and @xmath241 , we have @xmath242 dt \\nonumber\\\\ & = w(-1){\\mathcal{l}}_0(\\zeta ) + { \\hat{w}'_0}\\left [ { \\mathcal{l}}_1(\\zeta )   + { \\mathcal{l}}_0(\\zeta)\\right ]   \\nonumber\\\\ & \\quad+ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{\\hat{w}'_n}{2n+1 } \\left [ { \\mathcal{l}}_{n+1}(\\zeta )   - { \\mathcal{l}}_{n-1}(\\zeta)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the boundary values cancel out since @xmath243 . rearranging the series and comparing coefficients we obtain the compatibility conditions @xmath244 moreover",
    ", it can be verified that @xmath245    it is clear that these expressions can be applied recursively to relate @xmath235 and the boundary value @xmath246 to higher order derivatives under suitable regularity assumptions .",
    "substituting   into  , recalling the definition of the remainder functions @xmath247 , @xmath248 , @xmath249 , and using the orthogonality of the legendre polynomials  @xcite we obtain @xmath250 here , @xmath251 is as in   and @xmath252 where @xmath253 applying the compatibility conditions   to the first three terms of   we can find a real , symmetric , positive definite matrix @xmath180 such that @xmath254 moreover , since @xmath255 if @xmath256 or @xmath257  @xcite , the infinite sums over @xmath105 and @xmath116 in @xmath258 can be truncated to @xmath259 and @xmath260 respectively . calculating @xmath261 as in  @xcite and letting @xmath262",
    "we can write @xmath263 it should be understood that the second term is zero if @xmath264 .",
    "moreover , note that the @xmath265 s are linear in @xmath166 .",
    "using   we can then write @xmath266 for a suitably defined real matrix @xmath267 whose entries are linear combinations of the @xmath265 s ( and are therefore linear in @xmath166 ) .",
    "we remark that , contrary to @xmath180 , the matrix @xmath267 is _ not _ symmetric .",
    "in order to derive the lower bound on @xmath268 stated in  , we start by deriving a relation between @xmath269 , @xmath270 and @xmath271 . using   and the elementary inequality @xmath272",

    "we then use   and   to construct a matrix @xmath283 and a constant @xmath284 such that @xmath285 given the scaling estimates of @xmath274 and @xmath286 and the compatibility conditions  , it is relatively straightforward to see that @xmath287 and @xmath288 .",

    "let us consider the problem of enforcing the constraint @xmath199 , where @xmath295 is as in equation  , subject to  .",
