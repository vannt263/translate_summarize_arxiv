    "wall - bounded flows exhibit a rich spatio - temporal structure with high- and low - speed streaks superposed with turbulent fluctuations ( see , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . among the most fundamental statistical objects to characterize such flows is the space - time correlation , or equivalently , the wavenumber - frequency spectrum of the streamwise velocity .",
    "understanding spatio - temporal correlations is not only interesting from a fundamental fluid dynamics research point of view , but has also implications for the study of atmospheric boundary layers with potential applications in the field of wind energy research .",
    "wavenumber spectra for wall - bounded flows characterizing the spatial correlations have been subject to intense theoretical , experimental and numerical research for a long time ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but only recently measurements of the wavenumber - frequency spectra from a wall - bounded flow have been obtained @xcite , giving insights into spatio - temporal correlations .    following up on a recent work @xcite , we present here further results on wavenumber - frequency spectra of high - reynolds number data obtained from large - eddy simulation ( les ) of wall - bounded turbulence .",
    "we are especially interested in characterizing the logarithmic layer of the flow and hence focus here on the discussion of the height - dependence of the spatio - temporal spectra in this layer . to this end",
    ", wavenumber - frequency spectra of the streamwise velocity fluctuation as function of the streamwise wavenumber and frequency as well as of the spanwise wavenumber and frequency are discussed .",
    "we furthermore evaluate the influence of les grid resolution .",
    "in characterizing the spatio - temporal correlations of turbulent fluctuations in wall - bounded flows , advection of the fluctuations by the mean flow as well as by large - scale eddies turn out to be the dominant effects .",
    "the latter effect gives rise to eulerian time decorrelations and led kraichnan and tennekes to the introduction of the random - sweeping hypothesis @xcite . in the framework of this hypothesis smaller - scale velocity fluctuations",
    "are considered as passively advected by large - scale energy - containing eddies in a random fashion .",
    "the random - sweeping hypothesis plays an important role in various models for space - time correlations @xcite , but has also been used to quantify corrections to taylor s frozen turbulence hypothesis , as discussed , e.g. , in @xcite .    in a recent paper , we explored a simple advection model based on the kraichnan - tennekes random - sweeping hypothesis with additional mean flow for the space - time correlations of wall - bounded flows @xcite , which we will briefly summarize . in the present paper",
    "we further substantiate the validity of this random - sweeping advection model with mean flow in characterizing space - time correlations of wall - bounded turbulent flow and present tests of its predictions for various heights .",
    "the random - sweeping model with mean flow predicts the wavenumber - frequency spectrum to be a product of the wavenumber spectrum and a gaussian frequency distribution , which is parameterized by a doppler shift related to the mean velocity and a doppler broadening related to random - sweeping effects . the precise shape of the wavenumber spectrum as well as of the doppler shift and broadening as a function of wall distance , however , remain yet to be determined . in @xcite",
    "we obtained analytical model parameterizations for these terms .",
    "for the wavenumber spectrum we blend two phenomenological model spectra for the low and high wavenumbers , respectively .",
    "the height - dependence of the doppler shift and broadening terms are parameterized with the help of logarithmic laws for the mean and fluctuating velocity . here , we further benchmark this model with particular focus on the height - dependence of the spectra as well as on the influence of grid resolution .",
    "the article is structured as follows .",
    "we first present wavenumber - frequency spectra evaluated from les for various heights in the logarithmic layer of the flow as function of the streamwise wavenumber and frequency as well as of the spanwise wavenumber and frequency .",
    "these results are then compared to the predictions of a simple advection model .",
    "furthermore , comparisons to the analytical model are presented .",
    "finally , we assess the influence of les grid resolution on our results , before we conclude .",
    "the numerical data presented in this paper are obtained from les of wall - modeled half - channel flow with rough walls ( @xmath0)@xcite . in horizontal directions a pseudo - spectral discretization with periodic boundary conditions is implemented .",
    "the vertical direction is discretized with second - order finite differences . to model",
    "the sub - grid scale stresses we employ the lagrangian scale - dependent model @xcite . in absence of viscous scales",
    "we can not associate a well - defined reynolds number to our simulation but the les is meant to represent high - reynolds number flow .",
    "the computational domain @xmath1 is resolved with @xmath2 grid points .",
    "the simulation is run for @xmath3 time steps at a fixed time step of @xmath4 in the statistically stationary regime .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for further details ; the data set used here corresponds to case d2 in @xcite .    to characterize the spatio - temporal correlations of the streamwise velocity component @xmath5 in horizontal planes at various heights we study the wavenumber - frequency spectrum @xmath6 , which is a function of the horizontal wavenumbers @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the frequency @xmath9 as well as the distance from the wall , @xmath10 . for presentation purposes , as well as to increase statistical convergence , we consider the projections @xmath11 streamwise wavenumber - frequency spectra for various heights are shown in the left panels of figure [ fig : stream_wf_spec_vs_model ] .",
    "the spectra exhibit a doppler shift of frequencies towards higher wavenumbers .",
    "this spectral tilt is an immediate consequence of the mean flow advection .",
    "smaller - scale velocity fluctuations are experiencing a more pronounced doppler shift .",
    "as the mean velocity increases with increasing distance to the wall , the doppler shift is less pronounced closer to the wall .",
    "note that this effect is not apparent from the presented plots as we chose to present the frequency in its  taylor representation \" ,",
    "i.e. divided by the mean velocity .",
    "a second important observation is that the frequency distributions are not sharp , but display a considerable doppler broadening , i.e. a range of frequencies contributes to the spectral energy content of a single wavenumber .",
    "the majority of this effect can be accounted for by random sweeping effects of the smaller scales by the large scales .",
    "the broadening , which is a signature of temporal decorrelation , is further enhanced by the temporal evolution of the small scales .",
    "additionally one has to keep in mind that the projection to the @xmath7-@xmath9-plane leads to aliasing effects which also contribute to the doppler broadening .",
    "the doppler broadening decreases with increasing distance from the wall because the variance of turbulent fluctuations ( which are dominated by large - scale contributions ) decreases .",
    "spanwise wavenumber - frequency spectra are shown in the left panels of figure [ fig : span_wf_spec_vs_model ] .",
    "as the mean velocity has a streamwise component only , the characteristic tilt of the streamwise wavenumber - frequency spectrum is absent in this projection .",
    "still , the mean velocity advection influences the frequency scatter in this plot ; the unprojected spectrum @xmath6 can be pictured as an ellipsoid with a tilted orientation in the coordinate system spanned by @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the central axis of this ellipsoid is in good approximation given by the relation @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the mean velocity carrying the velocity fluctuations .",
    "when projected to the @xmath8-@xmath9-plane , the doppler shift contributes to the broad frequency distribution observed from the les data .",
    "of course , large - scale random - sweeping effects further increase the broadening .",

    "a general assessment on accuracy of space - time correlations obtained from les can be found in @xcite .",

    "the doppler broadening is lower in the low - res case .",
    "the differences can be understood in the framework of the random sweeping hypothesis .",
    "according to the variance of the frequency distribution depends quadratically on the wavenumbers .",
    "one consequence is that lower - resolution simulations lack some of the high - wavenumber contributions at which the wavenumber - frequency spectrum exhibits a considerable doppler broadening .",
    "these contribution are also missing upon projection , for example , to the @xmath7-@xmath9-plane , see . because the low-@xmath7 range contains also high-@xmath8 contributions ,",
    "also this range exhibits a reduced doppler broadening . the same argument , of course , also applies to the projection to the @xmath8-@xmath9-plane .",
    "because a reduced doppler broadening is related to a decreased decorrelation , these findings appear consistent with the ones presented in @xcite .    figure [ fig : stream_wf_spec_full_model_lores ] exemplarily shows a comparison to the analytical model spectrum , projected to the @xmath7-@xmath9-plane . as in the high - res case",
