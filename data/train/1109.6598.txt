    "the extreme ultraviolet ( euv ; 150  1200  ) waveband is replete with emission lines formed at temperatures that range from several times @xmath1 k to several times @xmath2 k , and is thus well suited for studying numerous features and phenomena that occur in the solar atmosphere .",
    "like most solar euv instruments , the solar euv research telescope and spectrograph ( serts ) sounding rocket payload observed only part of the euv waveband .",

    "the relative radiometric calibration was derived by combining laboratory measurements of component responsivities with  insensitive ratios \" ( solar emission line pairs whose intensity ratios are insensitive to variations in the electron density and temperature ) , while for the flight of 1995 the relative radiometric calibration was derived strictly by the insensitive ratio method . in all four cases the relative radiometric calibration was placed onto an absolute scale by requiring the sum of the he 303.78   and si 303.32   quiet - sun intensities to match the values reported by @xcite based on earlier observations from satellites and sounding rockets . in @xcite the summed intensity is 7115 ergs @xmath4s@xmath5sr@xmath5 at disk center and brightens by about 30% toward the limb .",

    "the importance of a reliable radiometric calibration for serts , cds , eis , or any euv instrument can not be over emphasized . without it , quantitative analyses of properties like temperature , density , emission measure , and element abundances , along with the physical interpretations that emerge from studies of those properties , are impossible .",

    "it is worth pointing out both the standard and the new long - term corrections for cds / nis include a wavelength - dependent decrease in responsivity .",
    "a major difference lies in that the standard correction assumed that the brightest lines would be most affected , so applies a correction which is too large for the strongest lines , while too small for the weaker lines .",

    "responsivity loss of euv spectrometers is often measured by monitoring the intensities of solar spectral lines from the basal chromospheric - transition region of quiet sun , which are known on average not to vary over the cycle ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a recent eis science nugget by doschek ( 2011 ) reported an e - folding time of 6.4 years for the eis instrument s responsivity by measuring the intensity variation of the he line at 256.32   using the synoptic data between january 2007 and july 2009 . by including quiet sun data near disk center early in the mission before the synoptics started and the synoptic data in 2010 , mariska ( 2011 , private communication ) updated the measurement of e - fold time to be 5.2 years , which gives a decrease of responsivity by a factor of 1.2 for the first year s flight , very well consistent with that derived in the present work .",
    "however , a preliminary investigation of the eis radiometric calibration based on chianti beta v.7 showed that the updated atomic data would reduce the eunis - to - eis line ratios by 10% for fe and si , and thus the degradation of eis responsivity by a factor of about 1.2 derived here may still be within the uncertainties of the eis prelaunch calibration .",

    "early observations from rocket , skylab and oso in 1960 - 70s give typical intensities of 7000@xmath09000 erg s@xmath5@xmath4sr@xmath5 for the he + si blend ( see table  [ tabhe ] and @xcite who summarized almost all historical records ) .",
    "the center - to - limb curve for quiet sun he + si intensity of such values reported by @xcite was used as a natural `` standard '' light source for absolute radiometric calibrations of serts-89 , serts-91 , serts-93 and serts-95 @xcite .",
    "serts-97 was directly calibrated at ral in the same facility used to characterize the cds and eunis instruments , and provided the calibration update for cds nis-1 first - order and nis-2 second - order lines .",
    "serts-97 pointed at two locations during its observation @xcite . the slit position in pointing 1 was in the quiet region with average he intensity of 7400 erg  s@xmath5@xmath4sr@xmath5 , while it covered the  quiet surroundings \" of an ar in pointing 2 with average he intensity 8270 erg  s@xmath5@xmath4sr@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the quiet - sun he radiance measured by serts-97 is consistent with the value measured near the disk center by @xcite from skylab , and is also well consistent with those measured by cds nis 2 during 19961998 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    however , we find that the quiet sun he radiances measured by eunis-07 on the order of 5000 erg s@xmath5@xmath4sr@xmath5 , which is about a factor of 1.4 smaller than that measured by serts-97 and about a factor of 1.6 smaller than the old measurements in 196070s ( see table  [ tabhe ] )",
    ". note that the old measurements include the blending emission from si line , but the blending typically contributes less than 10% of the total intensity of these two lines in the quiet sun , so can not explain the big difference from the eunis-07 measurement .",
    "based on the long - term monitoring of cds nis irradiances from 1998 to 2010 , @xcite suggested that the skylab values of the he 304   line in the quiet sun were overestimated , and so did for those by serts-89 , serts-91 , serts-93 and serts-95 whose absolute radiometric calibration was based on the skylab measurements . whereas the large difference between the serts-97 and eunis-07 measurements which were both based on the direct lab - calibration suggests that the large dispersion of measurements from different instruments may be partially ascribed to true variations depending on observed locations if the average is limited in a small fov , and on observing times ( e.g. different phases of a solar cycle , or different solar cycles ) .",
    "for example , the intensity of the he 304    line in  quiet surroundings \" of an active region may be significant larger than that in the very quiet region .",
    "eunis-06 showed that the  quiet surroundings \" have the values of 6000@xmath08000 erg  s@xmath5@xmath4sr@xmath5 , while the very quiet region considered where fe emission is nearly absent has the value of about 4100 erg  s@xmath5@xmath4sr@xmath5 .",
    "the serts-97 observation at pointing 1 showed variations of he intensities in  quiet region \" from 4500 to 12000 erg  s@xmath5@xmath4sr@xmath5 over the 353@xmath7-long slit .",
    "@xcite showed that the he irradiance measured during this solar minimum ( 20062008 ) is about a factor of 1.3 smaller than that measured in 1998 at the beginning of the last solar cycle .",
    "the dispersion of he intensities shown in table  [ tabhe ] suggests that one should be cautious about using the quiet - sun he line as a standard light source .",
    "in addition , we may verify the eunis-07 radiometric calibration by comparing the measured quiet - sun he 304   intensity with the radiance converted from irradiance measurements ( the full - disk flux measured at earth from this line or a narrow waveband centered at 304  ) during the solar minimum .",
    "since the he lines have negligible limb - brightening and off - limb contribution @xcite , the conversion for the quiet sun can be simply made by the relation @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the irradiance , @xmath36 is the solar radius , @xmath37 is the earth - sun distance , and @xmath38 is the intensity at disk - center . when the irradiance uses the unit of photons s@xmath5 @xmath4 and the intensity is in erg  s@xmath5@xmath4sr@xmath5 , the conversion coefficient between @xmath35 and @xmath38 at 304   is 1.04@xmath1010@xmath39 sr  photons  erg@xmath5 . from the quiet - sun intensity of 4960 erg  s@xmath5@xmath4sr@xmath5 by eunis-07",
    ", it derives irradiance to be @xmath40 photons s@xmath5 @xmath4 , which is well consistent with recent measurements ( ( 56@xmath41)@xmath42 photons s@xmath5 @xmath4 ) by cds nis-2 during the solar minimum from 2006 to 2008 @xcite , and those ( about 60@xmath42 photons s@xmath5 @xmath4 including the blended si line ) by prototype - eve rocket in april 2008 @xcite and by sdo / eve over may - december 2010 ( see table  [ tabhe ] ) .",
    "these comparisons verify the good radiometric calibration for eunis-07 .",
    "finally , we may check the absolute intensity of the quiet - sun he 304   line from eunis-07 using the theoretical line ratio and coordinated , cospatial eis measurements .",
    "the chianti ( ver.6.0 ) shows that the he 256 /304    ratio in optically thin condition is somewhat density sensitive , with a minimum value of 0.036 at log@xmath29 = 8.0 , and a maximum value of 0.117 at log@xmath29 = 11.0 , but a most likely value of 0.051@xmath110.011 for 9.0@xmath43log@xmath29@xmath4310.0 . in comparison , @xcite gave the observed ratio of this line pair to be 0.052 , and @xcite measured the ratio of he+si 256  to he 304  to be 0.046@xmath110.008 for an active region .",
    "these measurements agree with the predicted value within uncertainties . taking the theoretical ratio from chianti and the measured eis intensity of the he 256   line ( with calibration correction by eunis-07 , ie .",
    "scaled by a factor of 1.2 ) , we derived the intensity of he 304  to be 4810@xmath111040 for the eis 17:09@xmath018:00 ut raster and 4630@xmath111000 for the eis 18:02@xmath018:54 ut raster . despite the he lines being possibly optically thick , the quiet - sun he 304",
    "  intensity derived from eis is well consistent with that directly measured by eunis-07 , confirming an agreement between the eunis-07 and eis cross - calibration .    in the next flight ( expected in 2011 november )",
    "eunis will focus on the study of thermal structure of coronal loops and coordinated observations with sdo / aia .",
    "based on sdo images , two slit locations and rotational alignments will be chosen before flight to sample both active regions and quieter areas .",
    "eunis-11 will continue to provide the eis cross - calibration as done with eunis-07 using the insensitive line ratio technique .",
    "active region spectra will allow applications of more line pairs such as from fe@xmath0fe to provide a good coverage for the eis lw band .    in conclusion ,",
    "eunis-07 has provided important underflight calibration updates for cds / nis and hinode / eis .",
    "the results by eunis-07 well support the recent measurements of the long - term correction for the cds and eis instrument responsivities obtained by the inflight monitoring of the quiet - sun intensity of the chromospheric - transition region lines . the absolute value of the quiet - sun he 304    intensity measured by eunis-07 is well consistent with the radiance measured by cds nis in quiet regions near the disk center and the solar minimum irradiance obtained by cds nis and sdo / eve recently , but it is about a factor of 1.41.6 smaller than the previous values from serts-97 and skylab , reflecting possible real variations with locations and times .",
