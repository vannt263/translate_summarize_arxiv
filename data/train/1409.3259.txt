    "implicit in many of these early works is the idea that the expressions obtained may be useful for calculating the entropy of nonequilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "later , in a series of papers wallace @xcite applied these methods to the calculation of configurational entropy for real systems such as liquid sodium .",
    "for an equilibrium system in the grand canonical ensemble the entropy per particle @xcite is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the density which is uniform at equilibrium .",
    "the first two terms arise from kinetic theory .",
    "there is a kinetic contribution from the velocity distribution and the term @xmath23 is the configuration term that appears in kinetic theory and the sackur - tetrode equation from the local equilibrium distribution . the term involving 2-body correlations we will refer to as @xmath24 .",
    "the remaining term is the configurational contributions from 3-body correlations but higher order correlation function contributions also exist .",
    "banayai and evans @xcite have shown that when compared with thermodynamic integration , a numerical calculation at equilibrium using 2-body correlations typically yields approximately @xmath25 of the entropy and including 3-body correlations gives most of the rest . in all results presented here",
    "we consider only 2-body correlations , neglecting contributions from 3 ( or more)-body correlations .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations have proved a very effective means of testing theoretical approaches to the study of fluids both in equilibrium , and nonequilibrium steady states @xcite . for hard particles , in the absence of external forces",
    ", a particle trajectory is linear between collisions , so numerical simulations are only limited in accuracy by wordlength , and the accuracy of averages is only limited by statistical considerations .    in kinetic - theory",

    "the kinetic contributions to the entropy of the quasi - one - dimensional ( qod ) system have been studied recently @xcite and one of the purposes of this paper is to show that the configurational contributions can also be estimated .    the relation between the entropy flux and the heat flux may be viewed as a generalized version of the equilibrium clausius relation @xmath40 .",
    "it was found @xcite that the kinetic fluxes of heat and entropy times the local temperature match locally for the qod system away from equilibrium and the kinetic entropy density agrees very well with the local equilibrium result .",
    "one of the goals of this work is to determine whether this matching extends to the configurational components .",
    "the concept of temperature and entropy away from equilibrium are active open problems @xcite .",
    "the quasi - one - dimensional ( qod ) system of hard disks introduced in @xcite ( see figure ( [ qds ] ) ) can be modified to interact with an idealized _ heat reservoir _ in a deterministic and reversible way .",
    "the deterministic thermal reservoir couples to the qod system of hard disks by changing the collision rule at the reservoir boundary @xcite .",
    "a reservoir collision preserves the tangential component of momentum but the normal @xmath41-component after collision becomes @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the fixed value of the reservoir momentum determined by the reservoir temperature @xmath44 and @xmath45 is a reservoir coupling parameter .",
    "as @xmath46 the system decouples from the reservoir and the boundary becomes a hard wall , and as @xmath47 the incoming momentum is replaced by the reservoir momentum .",
    "recent studies of this system @xcite have shown that when in contact with two reservoirs of the same temperature the active mechanical coupling leads to a kinetic entropy production near each reservoir boundary which then flows into the reservoir .",
    "this effect is local and restricted to a small number of boundary layer particles regardless of the system size .",
    "the system with equal temperature reservoirs is also a dissipative dynamical system due to these reservoir collisions .",
    "in the calculations reported here we use a system width @xmath48 , a density @xmath49 and a fixed value of the right - hand reservoir temperature @xmath50 and then choose the left - hand reservoir temperature @xmath51 to obtain the required temperature gradient of @xmath52 so there is a heat flow from left to right .     hard - disk quasi - one - dimensional ( qod ) system .",
    "the height @xmath53 is sufficiently small that the disks can not pass one another .",
    "we choose the coordinate origin to be located at the bottom left corner of the system , and the periodic upper and lower system boundaries at @xmath54 are denoted by dashed lines .",
    "the boundaries at @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the hard walls of the reservoirs . ]    as this microscopic model couples mechanically and deterministically to the system it can be studied as a dynamical system and also as a thermodynamic system with energy and kinetic entropy flows calculated numerically without approximations .",
    "these idealized heat reservoirs have been studied by computer simulation and kinetic theory @xcite , to obtain both heat conduction in low dimensional systems @xcite , and the lyapunov spectrum and mode structure @xcite .",
    "the instantaneous local temperatures for each particle are @xmath57 and @xmath58 so the instantaneous system temperature is @xmath59 in the absence of a temperature gradient the average @xmath60 gives the system temperature , but when there is a temperature gradient the local time averages @xmath61 and @xmath62 give the local temperatures which will be used to determine the temperature profile inside the system .",
    "the difference between the components of the local temperature can be used to give a measure of the deviation from local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the deterministic reservoir allows the calculation of the usual dynamical systems properties @xcite as well the thermodynamic properties @xcite .",
    "as the system contains hard disks of diameter @xmath63 ( which we set equal to 1 ) in a narrow channel of width @xmath64 that does not allow the disks to interchange positions , see figure ( [ qds ] ) , we can associate any property of particle @xmath16 with the same _ local _ property of the volume element @xmath65 , centred at the average position of particle @xmath16 , that is @xmath66 .",
    "then for example , the local density is the inverse of the average volume occupied by the particle @xmath67 .",
    "this simple connection between volume element and particle property makes the qod system optimal for these studies .      where there is the possibility of a difference between the local values of the @xmath41 and @xmath68 temperatures , @xmath69 and @xmath70",

    "@xmath30 is given in @xcite .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case where the local streaming velocity @xmath76 is zero everywhere . defining the vectors @xmath77 and @xmath78 , the impulse force at collisions between particles @xmath16 and @xmath79 is @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the collision time and @xmath82 is the unit vector in the direction of @xmath83 .",
    "the total heat flux @xmath84 is obtained as the volume integral of the local heat current @xmath85 over the volume assigned to particle @xmath16 , that is @xmath86 . for the qod system the local heat flux has potential contributions from two sources , either from a collision of particles @xmath16 and @xmath87 or from a collision of particles @xmath88 and @xmath16 .",
    "the result is @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the internal energy of particle @xmath16 . in this form",
    "it is clear that the kinetic contribution is at @xmath91 while there are two potential contributions , one at @xmath91 and the other at @xmath92 .",
    "the time averages of the heat current must satisfy the continuity equation so on average , the same amount of heat passes through any vertical line regardless of its @xmath41 position .",
    "the heat current density in equation ( [ jql ] ) defines the instantaneous heat current at some arbitrary @xmath41 and @xmath30 but there is only a kinetic contribution if there is a particle at @xmath93 , and there is only a potential contribution if two particles collide where one is at @xmath94 and for the other at @xmath95 , so it is the time average of this instantaneous quantity that satisfies the continuity equation .",
    "in the same way as green proposed that the equilibrium expression for the entropy could serve as reasonable approximation for the entropy in nonequilibrium systems , we will generalize equation ( [ greenent ] ) to apply to nonequilibrium qod systems with a steady heat flow .",
    "we consider a steady state system with a temperature gradient along the @xmath41 direction where the average total momentum is zero .",
    "mechanical equilibrium implies that the pressure is constant throughout the system , but the imposed temperature gradient induces a density gradient and this needs to be explicitly included in the nonequilibrium form for the entropy .",
    "the temperature gradient implies a density gradient so @xmath22 is position dependent , and the distribution function @xmath96 for particle @xmath16 , defined using @xmath97 , will ensure that the integrand goes to zero at large separations .",
    "thus we propose the following expression for the nonequilibrium entropy of particle @xmath16 @xmath98 where @xmath99 is measured from the position of particle @xmath16 .",
    "the integral is over the volume of the qod system , @xmath100 and @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a cut - off distance .",
    "key to this form is that the density is position dependent and that the correlation functions @xmath96 are defined so that @xmath103 as @xmath104 , so that @xmath105 goes to zero ensuring the convergence of the integral .",
    "the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) are the kinetic contributions to the entropy @xmath106 of particle @xmath16 and the subsequent terms are the configurational contributions @xmath107 .",
    "the entropy density in the volume element associated with particle @xmath16 is then given by @xmath108 this nonequilibrium entropy density varies across the qod system as the velocity distribution changes , the local density @xmath109 changes and the correlation function @xmath110 also changes from particle to particle . in particular",
    ", the nonequilibrium boundary conditions induce an asymmetry in @xmath111 with respect to a sign change in @xmath112 .",
    "we will look more closely at these contribution in the coming sections .",
    "we study nonequilibrium qod systems of @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 hard disks at a density of @xmath116 with system width @xmath48 .",
    "the temperature of the cold reservoir on the right - hand side is kept constant at @xmath50 , and different values of the temperature of the left - hand reservoir @xmath117 are used to obtained the required temperature gradient @xmath118 . for @xmath119",
    "we consider three values for the temperature of the hot reservoir , @xmath120 so @xmath121 , @xmath122 a moderate gradient @xmath123 and @xmath124 a high gradient @xmath125 .",
    "for each of the larger system sizes we consider the same values of @xmath118 .    it has previously been observed that the numerically calculated local _ kinetic _",
    "entropy density agrees well with that calculated from the local equilibrium approximation @xcite .",
    "while the momentum distributions for the particles can not be exactly gaussian for a nonequilibrium steady state , the deviations from gaussian are at best only subtle and the local kinetic entropy density calculated from the numerical distributions is almost indistinguishable from the local kinetic entropy density obtained from the local equilibrium distribution .",

    "( [ 2 ] ) using the two - particle correlation function @xmath111 collected on a histogram of @xmath126 bins where @xmath112 is the radial distance @xmath127 .",

    "the kinetic entropy density is always positive and the configurational entropy density is always negative but smaller in magnitude so the total entropy density remains positive .",
    "in this paper we have followed the prescription originally imagined by green @xcite , ( i ) that eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) is correct when the fluid is in thermal and mechanical equilibrium , and ( ii ) when the fluid is not in thermal and mechanical equilibrium the entropy is always less than the equilibrium value .",
    "strictly , green was speaking about the canonical equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) rather than the grand canonical result used here .",
    "the demonstration of point ( i ) has been made previously in the work of baranyai and evans @xcite where both 2 and 3-body correlation functions are considered for equilibrium systems .",
    "here we demonstrate point ( ii ) for nonequilibrium systems and more strongly by calculating the local entropy per particle or alternatively by calculating the local entropy density .",
    "the qod system is particularly useful in connecting the property of a single particle with the density of that property in the average volume element occupied by that particle .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the derivations which lead from the entropy in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) to entropy per particle in eq . ( [ 2 ] ) rely on the canonical and grand canonical ensemble formulations that only apply at equilibrium .",
    "there is no equivalent derivation for a nonequilibrium steady state . applying eq .",
