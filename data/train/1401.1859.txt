    "present astronomical instrumentation applications in the millimeter and sub - millimeter desire photon backgrounded limited sensitivities .",
    "there are two possible basic approaches to further improve the sensitivity by increasing the number of detected spatial modes received by an imaging system .",
    "the first is to build an array consisting of numerous single - mode sensors with high optical efficiency .",
    "the second , a multi - mode sensor , detects many spatial modes on a single sensor ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) with well - defined angular and polarization characteristics . in astronomical observations , for example , both single - mode sensors and multimoded sensors ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) have found wide use for radiometry and photometry .",
    "various techniques can be used to specify the modes coupled to a sensor and the resulting system architectures can be categorized by their modal filtering techniques ( fig .",
    "[ fig : filter_techniques ] ) . in the context of polarimetry at millimeter wavelengths , where a significant use is for measuring the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ,",
    "the primary focus of the recent developments has been directed at large arrays of single - mode detectors with feed - coupled waveguide polarization diplexers  @xcite or planar - antenna coupled structures  @xcite which can be photolithographically produced in large numbers . here , polarization diplexing is achieved on the detector chip for the horizontal and vertical single mode detector channels ( fig .",
    "[ fig : filter_techniques ] , s3 ) .",
    "prior to these developments , dual - mode waveguide - based orthomode transducer ( omt ) structures followed by single - mode detectors  @xcite were used to form a polarimeter following the traditions of microwave design .",
    "alternatively , single - mode dual - polarization sensors were realized by combining intrinsically multimoded polarization - sensitive bolometers ( psbs ) with external modal filtering structures to define the angular acceptance ( fig .",
    "[ fig : filter_techniques ] , s2 )  .",
    "multimoded sensors for imaging have also achieved polarization sensitivity through a wire - grid analyzer  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : filter_techniques ] , m1 and mp1 ) .",
    "the analyzer grid architecture has also been employed in conjunction with a feed coupled array ( e.g. , ref .",

    "[ fig : filter_techniques ] , s1 ) .",
    "a multimoded bolometric sensor that is intrinsically polarization selective , as opposed to those using the wire - grid analyzer , belongs to another class of sensors and opens up a new phase space for polarization sensitive instruments in millimeter wavelength ( fig .",
    "[ fig : filter_techniques ] , m2 and mp2 ) .",
    "such a bolometer would employ a thin resistive grid as a polarization selective absorber .",
    "an m2 implementation is the sensor developed for pixie satellite mission proposal aimed at cmb polarization and frequency spectrum measurements  @xcite .",
    "this sensor employs a pair of orthogonally positioned resistive grids , each of which is separately read out , attaining simultaneous sensitivity to two linear polarizations .",
    "other applications exploiting the unique features of this sensor are also proposed  @xcite .",
    "an mp2 implementation , an intrinsically polarization - selective sensor based on a pair of filled arrays , was explored in ref .",

    "these types of sensors ( m2 and mp2 ) , similarly to m1 and mp1 , require cold baffling to control the detector power loading , but share an improved mapping speed advantage compared to the single - mode sensors  @xcite .    the focus of this paper is to provide an estimate of the angular- and polarization - dependent response pattern of the thin resistive absorber , and to show that bolometers corresponding to the m2 type in fig .",

    "further , the residual non - zero systematics are shown to have even - parity patterns .",
    "a potential use for these sensors is to probe the signature of the inflation in the early universe through the odd - parity , or so - called @xmath8-mode , patterns in the cmb polarization  @xcite , which is not contaminated by the even - parity beam systematics  @xcite .",
    "implications presented in this paper are general and applicable to a wide range of devices using thin absorbing grids or membranes , even though our work is motivated by the specific implementation of the device mentioned above  @xcite .",

    "the use of the large off - axis angles makes stray - light control easier and is often desirable in maximizing the number of modes .",
    "the number of modes ( @xmath9 ) is related to the absorption area ( @xmath10 ) , the solid angle ( @xmath11 ) and the wavelength ( @xmath12 ) by @xmath13 , and larger @xmath11 allows @xmath9 to be maximized while restraining the increase of the physical detector size @xmath10 . a combination of a fast final - focus lens and a multimoded polarimetor ( fig .",

    "we note that so - called filled - array sensors ( fig .  [",

    "there are a few assumptions in our analysis regarding the configuration of the device of interest .",
    "first , we assume the absorbing grid or membrane is resistive , as opposed to reactive , and the current in the direction normal to the absorber plane can be ignored .",
    "these approximations are valid if the absorber s physical thickness is small compared to the penetration depth of the resistive coating ( _ electrically thin _ , hereafter ) .",
    "secondly , when the absorber is a pair of orthogonal resistive grids , which are sensitive to orthogonal polarizations , we assume that the pitch of each grid and the distance between the two grids are small compared to the wavelength , and thus they are effectively resistive sheets on the same plane .",
    "it can be shown that there is little near - field modal coupling between the crossed grids in this regime . in appendix",
    "[ app : detector_geometry_assumption ] , we discuss the conditions on the physical dimension of the detector such that the above stated approximations are valid . for example , the device proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite satisfies such conditions . under these assumptions",

    "in the context of polarimetry , our focus in evaluating the goodness of a response pattern of a sensor is for control of polarization systematics . in particular , low cross polarization and small differential polarization response are important for high polarization efficiency and low spurious polarization  @xcite , respectively . in this section ,",
    "we describe the formalism to evaluate the ability of the sensor to reject these artifacts in the angular response and retain the polarization purity of the incident radiation . throughout this section , the word _ sensor",
