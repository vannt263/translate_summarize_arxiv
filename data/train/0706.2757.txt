    "solid - state spin systems have emerged to be promising candidates for quantum computation @xcite and communication @xcite , as they offer the possibility for tunable device parameters and scalability .",
    "however , their experimental realization requires control over the strong environmental decoherence . in most of the solid - state systems the interaction of qubits with the environmental spins",
    "is recognized to be a major source of decoherence @xcite .",
    "for example in the case of quantum dots the hyperfine interaction of the electron - spin with the nuclear spins is the dominant mechanism of decoherence @xcite . in the case of squids",
    "the macroscopic quantum coherence is shown to be strongly suppressed because by a spin - bath consisting of nuclear paramagnetic spins and charge defects @xcite .",
    "a well - studied model for decoherence is a central - spin system coupled to @xmath1 non - interacting spins@xcite .",
    "an exact evaluation of dynamics for the central - spins is obtained for special cases , where there is uniform coupling with the bath - spins @xcite , or a special choice of initial states@xcite , or the system - bath interaction is a simple interaction between the @xmath2 component of the spins@xcite .",
    "each such cases studied could explain the experimentally observed results in some solid - state devices @xcite . in most of these studies",
    "the central - spin system either experiences a large static field or zero field .",
    "but , an important requirement for quantum computing is control , which can be either optical@xcite or through the time - dependent magnetic fields@xcite . in the case of single qubits ,",
    "the control field is an oscillatory magnetic field , which can preform gate operations involving arbitrary spin rotations . on the other hand for two - qubits",
    "the exchange interaction between the qubits is the control field , for the implementation of the controlled not gate .",
    "recently , coherent spin rotations of a single electron were demonstrated in a double quantum dot@xcite .",
    "petta et.al .",
    ", @xcite have implemented the cnot gate or the @xmath3 gate , where the exchange interaction is controlled by gate voltages .",
    "in addition to the control of decoherence of the quantum state , it is equally important to control the loss of entanglement in multi - qubit systems .",
    "for example a maximally entangled state shared between two remote sites looses its entanglement due to the local environments @xcite .",
    "in such cases , it is important to know whether a local control could slow - down the entanglement loss , thereby increasing the fidelity for teleportation .    in this work",
    "we shall address the problem of decoherence and entanglement loss in the presence of a control field : a time - dependent magnetic field .",
    "we solve the dynamics exactly for the cases of a central - spin system consisting of one and two qubits . in the case of single - qubit",
    "the focus will be on the decay of rabi - oscillations , whereas for the two - qubits it would be on the loss of entanglement .",
    "we consider a central spin system consisting of one or more interacting qubits , coupled to a bath ( environment ) of @xmath1 spin-@xmath4 particles .",

    "the transverse field ( rotating field ) oscillates with a frequency @xmath10 .",
    "the exchange interaction between the qubits is represented by @xmath11 and the qubit - bath couplings by @xmath12 .",
    "we have neglected the self hamiltonian for the bath , as it is assumed to be weak in comparison to that of the other interactions in the model .",
    "such an assumption is valid , for example , in the case of quantum dots , where the qubits are electron spins and the bath particles are spin-@xmath4 nuclei . since the magnetic moment of electron , is much large @xmath13 in comparison to that of the nucleon , the interaction among the bath - spins and their coupling to external fields have a comparatively small effect on the dynamics . it was argued earlier by koppens @xmath14 @xcite , that for sufficiently large external magnetic fields i.e. , @xmath15 , the system - bath interaction considered in the above hamiltonian can replace the usual hyperfine interaction between the electron and nuclear spins .",
    "hence the above hamiltonian can describe the dynamics of the electronic spin states in quantum dots , in the regime of strong magnetic fields .",
    "the purpose of the work is two fold , to study the effect of a time - dependent field on the decoherence and the entanglement loss of the qubits .",
    "first in sec - ii , we consider the case of a single central spin , and study the effect of bath - interaction on the rabi oscillations between the states @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in detail",
