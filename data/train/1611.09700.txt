    "one of the most important systems in stress response is hypothalamus - pituitary - adrenal ( hpa ) axis , because the released hormones lead to energy directed to the organisms .",
    "the hpa axis is organized into three distinct regions : the hypothalamus , pituitary gland and adrenal gland .",
    "it is a complex set of direct influences and feedback interactions among the three endocrine glands .",
    "these glands work together by producing and secreting , or responding to common hormones including corticotropin - releasing hormone ( crh ) , adenocorticotropin ( acth ) , and cortisol ( cort ) @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the hpa axis is very important , because cortisol overproduction leads to cushing s disease ; cortisol underproduction generates addison s disease .    during the past decade ,",
    "the mathematical modelling of the hpa axis has been intensively studied @xcite . in 2005 ,",
    "savic and jelic @xcite presented one of the mathematical models of hpa axis described by a system with three nonlinear differential equations with one delay .",
    "three variables have been considered : the concentration of @xmath0 , the concentration of @xmath1 and the concentration of free cortisol @xmath2 . according to the results obtained by stability analysis",
    ", the system does not oscillate at all in the neighborhood of the equilibrium point . in 2006 , savic et al .",
    "@xcite considered the same model , but four time delays have been introduced .",
    "once more , their results showed that the system describing the hpa axis does not oscillate in a neighborhood of the equilibrium points .    in 2011 , vinther et al .",
    "@xcite introduced feedback functions as generalized hill functions , based on the receptor dynamics .",
    "they investigated the possibility of time delays as being capable of producing oscillations in accordance with the ultradian rhythm . by numercial simulations , oscillating solutions in a neighborhood of the equilibrium point",
    "have been observed .    in 2015 ,",
    "kaslik and neamtu @xcite proved the occurrence of oscillating solutions in a neighborhood of the unique equilibrium point , by performing a hopf bifurcation analysis , considering several distributed time delays and fractional derivatives in the minimal three - dimensional mathematical model previously analyzed in @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "gupta et al .",
    "@xcite and sriram et al .",
    "@xcite incorporated expression of the glucocorticoid receptor ( gr ) in the mathematical model of the hpa axis and demonstrated that repeated stress and the level of gr concentration leads to a disorder ; however , it is important to note that they did not consider time delays .    with the aim of improving the mathematical model of the hpa axis described in @xcite ,",
    "we include distributed time delays and fractional - order derivatives . on one hand ,",
    "distributed time delays represent the situation where the delays occur in certain ranges of values with some associated probability distributions , taking into account the whole past history of the variables . in many real world applications , distributed time delays",
    "are more realistic and more accurate than discrete time delays @xcite .",
    "distributed delay models appear in a wide range of applications such as , population biology @xcite , hematopoiesis @xcite , neural networks @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the main benefit of fractional - order models in comparison with classical integer - order models is that fractional derivatives provide a good tool for the description of memory and hereditary properties of various processes @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section 2 provides the mathematical model of the hpa axis , with the influence of the gr concentration , where we introduce distributed time delays to account for the time needed by the hormones to travel from source to destination , as well as fractional - order derivatives to account for the memory properties of the system . in section 3 , a local stability analysis of the system with distributed delays is provided .",
    "numerical simulations are carried out and discussed in section 4 , followed by concluding remarks in section 5 .",
    "the mechanism of the hpa axis can be shortly described as follows .",
    "paraventricular nuclei ( pvn ) of hypothalamus generate corticotropin releasing hormone ( crh ) which induces the adenocorticotropin ( acth ) production in the pituitary .",
    "then , acth stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce glucocorticoids , which in turn suppress the production of both crh and acth .    in formulating the mathematical model which describes the variation in time of the concentrations of the three hormones crh ,",
    "acth and cort , as well as the glucocorticoid receptors gr , the following sequence of typical events is considered , according to the schema presented in figure [ fig:0 ] .",
    "crh is secreted from the hypothalamus and released into the portal blood vessel of the hypophyseal stalk , and then transported to the anterior pituitary where it stimulates the secretion of acth . in our mathematical model , the evolution of the crh hormone concentration in the hypothalamus is described by : @xmath3 where @xmath4 models a circadian production and stress term , @xmath5 is the inhibition constant , @xmath6 is the degradation rate of cortisol .    in the pituitary , cortisol enters the cells and binds the glucocorticoid receptor in the cytoplasm , causing the receptor to dimerize .",
    "this leads to the complex @xmath7 that inhibits the production of @xmath1 , modeled by : @xmath8 where @xmath9 stands for a production term , @xmath10 is the inhibition constant , @xmath11 is the degradation rate of @xmath1 , and @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dimerization constant , @xmath14 the binding affinity constant , @xmath15 the production constant and @xmath16 the degradation term for pituitary @xmath17 production .    as for the evolution of cortisol concentration produced by the adrenal ,",
    "the following equation is considered : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a production coefficient and @xmath20 is the degradation rate of @xmath2 .    therefore , the four - dimensional mathematical model with distributed time delay is : @xmath21 with the initial conditions",

    "they are assumed to be bounded , piecewise continuous and satisfy @xmath31 the average delay of a delay kernel @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 two important classes of delay kernels often used in the literature are worth mentioning :    * dirac kernels : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 . in this particular case ,",
    "the distributed delay is reduced to a discrete time delay : @xmath36 * gamma kernels : @xmath37 , where @xmath38 .",
    "the average delay of a gamma kernel is @xmath39 .    on the other hand ,",
    "we also consider the four - dimensional mathematical model with fractional - order derivatives of caputo type and discrete time delays @xmath40 : @xmath41 with the initial conditions @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath42 $ ] , where @xmath27 are bounded continuous functions defined on @xmath43 $ ] , with values in @xmath29 .",

    "for the numerical simulations , we consider the scaled parameter values used in @xcite : @xmath160 for these values of the system parameters , three positive equilibrium states coexist because of the homodimerization of the gr with cortisol : one equilibrium state with a low gr concentration which is asymptotically stable for any choice of time delays , one equilibrium state with a medium gr concentration which is unstable for any choice of time delays and one equilibrium state with a high gr concentration whose stability depends on the choice of time delays .",
