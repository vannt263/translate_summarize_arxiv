    "optical quantum information science offers powerful techniques for secure messaging and networking , processing and metrology , with significant advantages over techniques based on the laws of classical physics alone  @xcite .",
    "photons also play a major role in fundamental studies on the nature of our world  @xcite .",
    "an essential component for many optical quantum techniques and technologies is an efficient source of high - quality single photons or entangled photon pairs .",
    "the ultimate goal is a deterministic and on - demand photon source , of which development is ongoing  @xcite .",
    "one approach to building a deterministic source is the networked switching of high - quality probabilistic sources  @xcite , such as heralded photon pair sources based on spontaneous parametric downconversion ( spdc ) . in the short- to medium - term ,",
    "heralded pair sources without switching remain the favored architecture for modern experimental quantum optics because of the excellent capabilities they provide .    in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate a very high quality spdc source using periodically - poled ktiopo@xmath1 ( ppkpt ) in a polarizing sagnac interferometer geometry .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate very high nonclassical ( hong - ou - mandel ) interference between telecom photons from different sources , while maintaining high heralding efficiency ( the probability of photon detection once the other photon or the pair is detected ) .",
    "our source can also be configured to produce high quality polarization entanglement between telecom photons ( also with high heralding efficiency ) .",
    "it uses a femtosecond pump laser , providing advantages in cost and simplicity over picosecond - pulse - length sources .",
    "our goals are motivated by the key requirements of photonic quantum information experiments .",
    "the photons should be of high purity , so to provide high non - classical interference visibility , which is a crucial component of most quantum state transformation circuits .",
    "high heralding efficiency is essential for many applications , including loophole - free entanglement certification protocols . alongside brightness",
    ", high heralding efficiency is a crucial ingredient in improving the practical scalability of multi - photon experiments which would require multiple sources of this kind .",
    "these include protocols based on quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping , the core components of a future quantum repeater .",
    "additionally , a precious resource that can be obtained from the pair source is entanglement in a specific degree of freedom ( e.g. polarization ) . finally , in multi - photon experiments , photon pairs need to be precisely localized in time , so the source relies on a femto- or pico - second pulse - length laser pump , instead of continuous - wave ( cw ) pumping .",
    "although each of these features is achievable with spdc , no optimal source configuration that demonstrates all of these properties has been presented so far . here",
    "we report on a polarization - entangled spdc source in the telecom @xmath2 wavelength range , which provides all of these properties at the same time .    for the last two decades ,",
    "the workhorses of photonic quantum information and communication have been bulk crystal sources .",
    "the most common approach utilizes non - collinear emission from type - ii bulk barium borate ( bbo ) crystals , where collection from intersecting downconversion cones yields a polarization - entangled state  @xcite .",
    "while these traditional sources are still widely used for many photonic quantum information implementations - most notably those concerned with multi - photon experiments - the past decade has seen the development of a new generation of photon sources that exploit recent advances in nonlinear optics .",
    "quasi - phase matching via periodic poling overcomes many of the limitations of angle phase matched sources , which include lower heralding efficiencies and lack of control over spectral properties of downconverted photons .",
    "one can utilize comparatively long crystals in collinear geometries , yielding both an inherently higher spectral flux and higher collection efficiencies .",
    "however , unlike the traditional bulk - crystal sources in which polarization entanglement is engineered within the emission cones , an additional step is required to polarization - entangle the emitted photons .    in 2006 , kim _ et al .",
    "_ provided the first demonstration of polarization - entangled photons from a ppktp crystal embedded within a polarizing sagnac interferometer utilizing a cw pump  @xcite .",
    "it was further advanced by fedrizzi  _ et al .",
    "_ , yielding a source that was simultaneously bright , highly entangled and widely spectrally tuneable  @xcite . in the cw regime , sagnac - based sources are rapidly surmounting traditional bulk sources , with the increased brightness and potential for high heralding efficiencies allowing access to new and more comprehensive quantum information demonstrations  @xcite .",
    "however , cw pumping is incompatible with multi - photon experiments and the sagnac architecture was first extended to the pulsed regime with narrowband pump pulses  @xcite and later in the non - degenerate case of femtosecond pump pulses  @xcite .    however , expanding the reach of photonic quantum information demands more than brightness alone .",
    "ambitious implementations concerned with interfering multiple downconversion sources are hindered by limitations in purity , indistinguishability and heralding efficiency . in traditional spdc sources , bi - photons",
    "are born spectrally entangled .",
    "photon - counting measurements insensitive to this spectral information degrade the purity and indistinguishability of the state .",
    "these spectral correlations are traditionally erased by harsh spectral filtering of the state at the cost of both brightness and heralding efficiency .",
    "a more sophisticated approach to the problem is to instead directly engineer the process of downconversion itself to generate inherently pure bi - photons through group velocity matching ( gvm )  @xcite .",
    "gvm was first demonstrated in 2004 in the context of second harmonic generation  @xcite in ppktp , and has since been been used to generate spectrally pure photons in bulk kdp  @xcite , bulk  @xcite and waveguided ppktp  @xcite and bulk bbo  @xcite .",
    "the direct engineering of both the pump and crystal parameters improves the spectral factorability of the source , which improves the brightness and heralding efficiency by virtue of avoiding extensive spectral filtering .",
    "the source that we report on unites the complementary ideas of brightness through quasi - phase matching and collinear geometries , and engineered spectral purity and degeneracy",
    ". it also amounts to the first demonstration of a sagnac interferometer to generate polarization entanglement in the femtosecond regime .",
    "this work naturally divides into two parts . following  @xcite ,",
    "we first consider the spectral engineering of the downconversion source to produce degenerate and factorable photon pairs at @xmath2 .",
    "we then proceed to demonstrate polarization entanglement using a sagnac interferometer .",
    "we characterize our source s performance with a number of tests , such as joint spectral intensity measurement , state characterization through polarization tomography and two - source hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) interference .",
    "spdc is a @xmath3 non - linear process in which a pump photon of frequency @xmath4 is spontaneously split into a pair of daughter photons , by convention labeled the signal , @xmath5 , and the idler , @xmath6 , with their individual frequencies constrained by energy and momentum conservation .",
    "the two - photon wave function can be modeled as a integral over all possible frequency modes  @xcite , @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the creation operators of the signal @xmath10 and idler @xmath11 modes .",

    "the pump function is assumed to be gaussian with a width proportional to the spectral bandwidth of the pump field . for a central frequency @xmath4 and bandwidth @xmath15 ,",

    "are theoretically modeled following the theoretical work of bennink  @xcite regarding collinear spdc . among various literature ,",
    "the use of sellmeier equations obtained from  @xcite in combination with the thermal expansion described in  @xcite provided us the theoretical predictions that were in strong agreement with our experimental results .",
    "we also note that recently , a new tool for spdc parameters calculation has appeared online  @xcite .    to create a factorable jsa as shown in fig .",
    "[ theoryplots](c ) we must meet three conditions .",
    "firstly , the peak contour of the phase matching function , defined by @xmath23 , must be aligned perpendicular to the fixed @xmath24 pump function ( fig .",
    "[ theoryplots](a ) ) , therefore @xmath25 in fig .",
    "[ theoryplots](b ) must be @xmath24 .",
    "using the lowest order terms in the power expansion about the center frequencies and assuming perfect phase matching at the center frequencies @xmath26 , we are left with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , which can be written as @xmath29 for a circular jsa @xmath30 we obtain a group velocity matching condition of @xmath31 , where the group velocity is given by @xmath32 , which corresponds to an optimal degenerate downconversion wavelength of @xmath33 for our ktp crystal . for practicality",
    "we consider a center pump wavelength of @xmath34 , resulting in a central downconversion wavelength of @xmath35 .",
    "this deviation will result in a slightly elliptical jsa , however will not make a significant reduction to the state purity .",
    "secondly , the crystal length and pump bandwidths must be matched .",
    "a @xmath36 crystal length is chosen to match our fourier - limited @xmath37 laser pulses , the spectral purity maximized by a pump bandwidth of @xmath38 .",
    "finally we then select a poling period to achieve phase matching at these wavelengths , with a period of @xmath39 yielding degeneracy at @xmath2 at normal incidence and room temperature .",
    "we experimentally implemented this design in the laboratory .",
    "we used a modelocked ti : sapphire laser with a center wavelength of @xmath40 to pump a ppktp crystal in the collinear geometry and with type - ii phasematching , with experimental parameters as listed above .",
    "we separated the ( initially ) co - propagating downconverted photons using a polarizing beam splitter and filtered away the pump beam using a dichroic mirror and a long pass filter ( _ semrock ff875-di01 _  @xcite and _ lp02 - 808ru _",
    "@xcite , respectively ) .",
    "the photons were coupled into single - mode optical fibers with good mode matching , and were detected using superconducting nanowire single photon detectors ( snspds )  @xcite with system quantum efficiencies @xmath41 . in order to compensate for the polarization - dependent behavior of snspds , we optimized the quantum efficiency with fiber polarization controllers , when the photons that were coupled into fiber always had the same polarization ( e.g. after a polarizing element ) .",
    "if a measurement across several polarizations was required , then either the fpcs were adjusted for each , or several random unitary were applied to the fibers ( by looping the fibers differently over time ) to average the polarization state .    to confirm the spectral factorability of the downconverted photon pairs , the joint spectral intensity ( jsi )",
    "was sampled via two time - of - flight spectrometers @xcite .",
    "the group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) in dispersion compensation fibers ( dcf ) was used to temporally stretch the downconverted photons , providing sufficient temporal resolution to resolve the spectral correlations ( or lack thereof ) manifesting in arrival times between our spdc pairs ( see fig .  [ theoryandspectra](a ) ) .",
    "the gvds of our two dcfs were characterized by measuring the fiber delays with a tuneable laser in the telecom band .",
    "the spectrometer s resolution , limited by temporal distance between consecutive pump pulses and the time bin size of the coincidence logic card , are estimated to be @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "figures  [ theoryandspectra](b ) and  [ theoryandspectra](c ) show a comparison of our theoretically modeled jsi and our experimentally measured jsi .",
    "the results support the frequency degeneracy and factorability of the bi - photon state .",
    "we note that we also performed the characterisation using a crystal with a poling period of @xmath44 , as reported in  @xcite . in this case",
    ", we were able to experimentally achieve a degenerate spectrum only when the crystal tilt was adjusted away from the normal incidence , an observation which was also in agreement with our theoretical calculations .",
    "the optimization of the pump and collection modes plays a significant role in determining the heralding efficiency , brightness and spectral purity of the source . as such",
    ", we first characterized the downconversion source in an unentangled configuration .",
    "bennik provided a comprehensive theoretical description of how the choice of pump and collection modes in collinear sources requires compromises in heralding efficiency , spectral purity and source brightness  @xcite .",
    "this theoretical work has since been experimentally supported  @xcite .",
    "to optimize the source heralding efficiency we concede brightness and select a pump waist of @xmath45 , and signal and idler waists of @xmath46 , yielding a theoretical upper - bound of our heralding efficiency of @xmath47 excluding all optical and detection losses .",
    "the chosen parameters were implemented with measured raw symmetric heralding efficiencies ( we use the definition of klyshko efficiency  @xcite , i.e. the ratio between _ detected _ two - fold coincidences over singles of the heralding arm ) of up to @xmath48 for both the signal and idler modes , for the @xmath49 range of laser pump power . using @xmath50 of laser pump power",
    "we observed @xmath51 two - fold coincidence counts per second @xmath52 , which corresponds to a pair per pulse generation probability into the collected mode of @xmath53 . setting pump power below @xmath50 started to affect negatively our observed heralding efficiency due to increased contribution from snspds dark counts .",
    "the primary source of loss in this configuration remains the non - unit quantum efficiency of snspds .",
    "straightforward gains can be made to the existing heralding efficiency with better quality optical coatings and background filtering and with improvements in the fiber coupling setup .",
    "to polarization - entangle our downconverted photon pair , the aforementioned source is embedded within a polarizing sagnac interferometer , detailed in fig .",
    "[ experimentalfigure ] . in this configuration ,",
    "a diagonally polarized pump beam is split into its horizontally ( transmitted ) and vertically ( reflected ) polarized components on a dual - wavelength polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) .",
    "the two orthogonally polarized pump ( labeled as transmitted and reflected from pbs ) fields propagate in opposing directions around the sagnac , bi - directionally pumping the ppktp crystal centered within the sagnac loop . the dual - wavelength half - wave plate ( hwp ) between the reflected port and",
    "the crystal serves to rotate the linear polarization of the reflected pump field to horizontal for downconversion and to rotate the polarization state of the downconverted photons in the transmitted propagating path by 90@xmath54 to compensate for any temporal walk off .",
    "the two counter - propagating downconversion modes are then combined at the dual - wavelength pbs , erasing any distinguishing path information .",
    "it should be noted that as the signal ( idler ) photon is interfered with its counter - propagating signal ( idler ) , the degeneracy of the source should have little effect on the quality of the entanglement .",
    "the space constraints of our current - generation sagnac configuration limited our choice of focusing @xmath55 and collimating @xmath56 lenses , so the pump - collection waists used in the generation of source were less optimal compared to the unentangled configuration . using @xmath50 of pump power ,",
    "we have achieved the symmetric heralding efficiencies of @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , for the pump waist of @xmath60 , and signal and idler waists of @xmath61 , which was improved to @xmath62 , once the pump waits was set to @xmath63 , while the number of observed coincidence counts and pair generation probability reduced to @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively .",
    "other reasons for the reduced efficiency , compared to the unentangled configuration , were the higher number of optical components involved in the setup and increased ellipticity of the pump beam that reduced the mode matching with the optical fiber .",
    "we expect higher heralding efficiencies in the future with a new layout design that would account for these imperfections and limitations .",
    "the femtosecond regime of this sagnac implementation relaxes a few conditions that are relevant for picosecond and cw implementations .",
    "the large bandwidth means the spectral degeneracy of the source is largely insensitive to temperature fluctuations in the crystal , simplifying two - photon interference between independent sources .",
    "spectral mismatch was suggested as the dominant limitation in a previous demonstrations  @xcite . as our poling period of @xmath39 is phasematched for degenerate downconversion at 1570 nm at @xmath66",
    ", our two - photon interference does not require any active temperature stabilization .",
    "after assembling two sagnac sources , we have characterized the quality of the produced entangled state .",
    "we used @xmath50of pump laser power per source for all the measurements reported below .",
    "quantum state tomography  @xcite was used to characterize the polarization entanglement of the state .",
    "we consider : the fidelity @xmath67 of the reconstructed two - photon density matrix @xmath68 with the maximally entangled singlet state , @xmath69 ; the tangle ; and the state purity , as three important parameters  @xcite of the state we produced .",
    "the measurements were performed for two cases , as reported in table 1 .",
    "for the first case , no filtering was applied , besides the @xmath70 broad bandpass bbp filters ( _ alluxa 1575 - 50 od4 _",
    "@xcite ) , which were used to block the residual pump and luminescence from optical components and did not affect our two- and four - fold coincidence rates .",
    "in second case , we have applied bandpass filters with a nominal fwhm of @xmath71 ( _ semrock nir01 - 1570/3 - 25 _",
    "@xcite ) to our downconverted photons .",
    "while the unfiltered case has demonstrated the high quality of our prepared state , we observe further improvement when additional filtering is applied , though at the cost of a reduced heralding efficiency approximately by half .",
    "[ table : char ]    .entangled state characterization [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we observe similar results in the quality of our two - source ( i.e.  independent - photon ) two - photon hong - ou - mandel visibility measurement , shown in fig .",
    "[ homdips ] . without additional spectral filtering ,",
    "the theoretical purity of the engineered single - photon source for our chosen parameters is @xmath72 due to the sinc function side lobes of the jsi , as shown in fig .",
    "[ theoryplots](c ) . for the unfiltered state",
    "we observe a two - photon 4-fold interference visibility of @xmath73 ( fig .",
    "[ homdips](b ) ) , which improves to @xmath74 with the addition of the @xmath71 bandpass filters in the interfering arms only ( fig .",
    "[ homdips](c ) ) .",
    "these visibilities were calculated from raw data without taking into account the imperfect splitting ratio of the @xmath75 ( average measured is @xmath76 ) beam splitter used in the interference setup and without any type of background subtraction .    for the filtered case ,",
    "an average interference visibility , calculated from multiple repeated measurements iterations was found to be @xmath77 , with the drop in visibility being mainly attributed to the temperature variations ( @xmath78 ) of the laboratory environment .",
    "once the temperature stability was improved we were repeatedly observing hom interference with the average visibilities between @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "this is currently the best repeatable two - source photon interference observed that we are aware of for conventional  @xcite and telecom group velocity matched  @xcite sources . while we still require filters to increase our overall source purity beyond the limit of @xmath72 , recent work propose directly engineering a gaussian phase - matching function through sophisticated periodic poling , bringing the purity of the bi - photon state close to unity with only the requirement of background filtering @xcite .",
    "a reason for significant improvement of interference visibility , over traditional sources , is the presence of the group velocity matching condition which removes one of the two types of time jitter between the independent photon pairs  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the interference visibility is limited by the events when multiple photon pairs are produced from single crystal . for our observed heralding efficiencies and the photon pair production probability of @xmath65 this upper bound",
    "is estimated to be @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "these result suggests the large bandwidth of the downconverted photons limits the state quality .",
    "an outstanding challenge for our source is the spectral flatness of optical coatings over wide frequency bands .",
    "the downconverted photons have a fwhm of approximately @xmath82 , which means photons associated with the central lobe of the jsi appreciably exist across a spectral bandwidth of approximately @xmath83 . with the addition of a @xmath71 filter we observe a clear improvement in the quality of our downconverted state .",
    "this result supports our main conjecture that the downconverted photons further away from the central wavelength of 1570 nm are partially depolarized by the optical elements within the sagnac and measurement setup .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that the filtering we apply has a significantly wider pass band than the usual fwhm@xmath84 filters that are used in most multi - photon experiments requiring high state and interference quality  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , our results demonstrate the first entangled spdc source that simultaneously possesses high purity , heralding efficiency and entanglement . with these types of sources ,",
    "we have observed the highest visibility of non - classical interference between two independent photon sources , to date . while spectral mismatch was suggested as the dominant limitation in a previous demonstrations  @xcite , the femtosecond regime of this sagnac implementation relaxes a few conditions relevant for picosecond and cw implementations .",
    "the large bandwidth of the pump and downconverted photons means the spectral degeneracy of the source is largely insensitive to small frequency mismatches and phasemathcing temperature fluctuations .",
    "additionally , downconversion at telecom wavelength , where high efficiency snspds perform optimally , makes this source a perfect candidate for long - distance quantum communication experiments .",
