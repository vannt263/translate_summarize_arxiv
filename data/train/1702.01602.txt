    "vega is problematic as a fundamental calibrator .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey committed to using four principal photometric standards @xcite , but in the end relied primarly on the star bd + 174708 .",
    "recently , it was revealed that this star brightened by 0.04 mag in the @xmath2 bands from 1986 to 1991 @xcite .",
    "here we present a set of bright spectrophotometric standards , many of the brightest stars visible in the southern hemisphere during the southern summer .",
    "our data expand the lists of stars observed by @xcite and @xcite . given the increase in sensitivity of instrumentation over the years , it might be the first time in 40 years that carefully calibrated spectra of most of these bright stars have been obtained .",
    "using well defined bandpasses @xcite , we can use our spectra to generate @xmath3 photometry tied to a model of sirius , which is a `` well behaved '' star compared to vega .",
    "the target stars are situated from @xmath470  to + 9  declination , and all but one have right ascensions ranging from @xmath55 to 13 hours ( see fig . [",
    "fig : positions ] and table [ tab : stars ] ) .",
    "about half the target stars are members of binary or multiple star systems . @xmath1",
    "cma ( sirius ) and @xmath1 car ( canopus ) are the two brightest stars in the night sky .",
    "@xmath6 ori is the brightest o - type star in the sky .",
    "two other notable stars are @xmath7 cma and @xmath8 cma . the former was the brightest star in the sky 4.7 million years ago ( with visual magnitude -3.99 ) .",
    "the latter was the brightest star in the sky 4.4 million years ago ( with visual magnitude -3.65 ) .",
    "this was not due to changes in their _ intrinsic _ luminosities .",
    "it was due to their changing _ distances _ from the sun @xcite .",

    "their targets are primarily northern hemisphere objects .",
    "three nights were allocated to this project on the ctio 1.5-m telescope in january of 2003 , and eight more nights were allocated in january of 2005 . however , due to a variety of hardware and weather programs , we only obtained useful data on two nights , 6 january 2003 and 21 january 2005 ( ut ) . on the first night",
    "all the spectra were taken with the blue grating .",
    "on the second night all the spectra were taken with the red grating .",
    "details of the facility spectrograph rcspec are discussed by @xcite .",
    "the blue and red gratings give dispersions of 2.85 and 5.43   per pixel , respectively .",
    "@xcite give 5.34   per pixel as the dispersion of the red grating , but this is a transcription error .",
    "the fwhm values are 8.6   for the blue grating and 16.4   for the red grating . because of the extreme brightness most of our stars",
    ", we included a 7.5 mag neutral density filter in the light path to prevent saturation of the pixels .",
    "our exposure times ranged from 5 to 420 seconds . while the spectra of landolt standards obtained by @xcite are useful at wavelengths as short as 3100  , ours are no good below 3300  .",
    "raw two dimensional spectra were saved as fits files 1274 by 140 pixels in size .",
    "batches of four spectra were taken of each star , with the telescope offset 30 arcsec west along the slit between spectra to place the spectrum on a different part of the chip . a he - ar - ne arc spectrum",
    "was taken before every batch .",
    "once the star was centered in a 2  slit , the slit width was widened to 21 . since many of our targets are close binary or multiple stars , this means that many of our spectra are blended spectra of more than one star . on the plus side ,",
    "such a wide slit eliminates any worries about guiding and seeing , allowing accurate spectrophotometry under clear sky conditions .",
    "spectra were reduced in the iraf environment .",
    "we made extensive use of the spectroscopic reduction manual of @xcite .",
    "we first bias subtracted , trimmed , and flattened the spectra .",
    "one dimensional spectra were extracted with _",
    "apall _ in the apextract package .",
    "wavelength calibration was accomplished using _ identify _ , _ reidentify _ , and _ dispcor _ in the ctioslit package .",
    "once we had carried out the wavelength calibration we could ask the question : to what extent were our two useable nights clear ? to do this one can sum up the instrumental counts over some wavelength range , then take @xmath42.5 log@xmath13 of the counts to produce instrumental magnitudes . in fig . [",
    "fig : clear_sky ] we show these instrumental magnitudes vs. airmass from 27 sirius spectra obtained on 6 january 2003 .",
    "we have eliminated the 9 spectra that were the final spectra of the batches of four on this date . for reasons we do not understand the final spectrum of each batch often gave an instrumental magnitude that was about @xmath50.10 mag fainter than the other three . in fig .",
    "[ fig : clear_sky ] the slope is 0.237 @xmath14 0.009 mag per airmass . the rms residual of the fit is @xmath140.018 mag , which is comparable to ccd photometry on a photometric night .",
    "the wavelength range for integrating those spectra was 3600 to 5500  .",
    "this is somewhat wider than the standard @xmath15-band filter . from photometry at cerro tololo and las campanas we find a mean @xmath15-band extinction coefficient of 0.262 @xmath14 0.007 mag per airmass .",
    "the bottom line is that by using rcspec as a photometer , we demonstrated that 6 january 2003 was clear the whole night .",
    "similar considerations for the spectra taken on 21 january 2005 indicate that this night became non - photometric by 05:27 ut .",
    "we will only consider spectra taken on this night prior to this time .",
    "the flux calibration of our spectra was carried out with tasks _ standard _ , _ sensfunc _ , and _ calibrate _ within the ctioslit package . with the _ calibrate _ task we applied extinction corrections appropriate for cerro tololo ( found in file onedstds$ctioextinct.dat within iraf ) .    for flux calibration of the blue grating spectra obtained on 6 january 2003",
    "we observed the spectrophotometric standards hr 3454 ( observed at a mean airmass of 1.201 ) and hr 4468 ( observed at mean airmass 1.154 ) . for red grating spectra obtained on 21 january 2005 we used the standard hr 1544 for the flux calibration .",
    "it was observed at a mean airmass of 1.427 .",
    "the mean airmass values for the observations of our target stars are given in table [ tab : stars ] .",
    "any systematic errors in the flux calibration with iraf will be equal to the arithmetic _ difference _ of the airmass of the standards and the program stars _",
    "times _ the arithmetic _ difference _ of the true extinction coefficient as a function of wavelength minus the adopted mean values appropriate to ctio . for photometric sky and observations above an elevation angle of 45 degrees , any systematic error of the flux calibration should be less than 10 percent in the @xmath15-band and less than 5 percent in the @xmath16 bands . _",
    "relative _ fluxes of our spectra and synthetic photometry have estimated internal random errors of 3 percent or better ( see below ) .",
    "the final step in our reduction was to tie the spectra to a kurucz model of sirius . an ascii version of an r=1000 spectrum of sirius was kindly provided by ralph bohlin .",
    "the sampling is at twice the frequency of the resolution .",
    "the model spectrum has t = 9850 k , log @xmath0 = 4.30 and metallicity [ fe / h ] = + 0.4 .",
    "the wavelengths of the model spectrum were in nm , so we multiplied by 10 to convert them to  .",
    "we also want wavelengths in air , rather than vacuum wavelengths .",
    "for this we used the transformation given at the sdss data release 7 website .",
    "finally , we used a scale factor of 2.75440 @xmath17 to convert the kurucz model flux to that of sirius , so that it is measured in erg @xmath18 s@xmath19 @xmath19 .    in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sirius ] we see the kurucz model spectrum .",
    "the middle panel is the average of 18 blue grating spectra of sirius ( taken at airmass less than 1.3 ) , and 16 red grating spectra , as processed with iraf .",
    "we have stitched together the blue grating spectra and the red grating spectra at 6000  , which produces a small discontinuity at that wavelength .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sirius ] is the _ ratio _ of the kurucz spectrum and our mean sirius spectrum .",
    "we call that ratio the `` flux function '' or `` spectral flat '' .",
    "all our other spectra are then multiplied by the flux function to place them on a system tied to the kurucz model of sirius .",
    "this largely , but not entirely , takes out the discontinuity at 6000   and also takes out telluric features such as the fraunhofer b- , a- , and z - lines at 6867 , 7594 and 8227  , which are due to atmospheric o@xmath20 .",
    "the identity of a feature at @xmath53680   evident in many of our spectra is uncertain ; it too is largely taken out by the spectral flat .    the average value of the flux function shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sirius ] is 0.990 , which is close enough to 1.000 to give us confidence that the flux calibration of our coadded spectra of sirius , obtained with iraf , is consistent with the scaling of the model of sirius to the flux density of the star .",
    "our ultimate filter by filter zeropoints are the values of the @xmath3 magnitudes of sirius given in table [ tab : stars ] , which come from @xcite .",
    "fully reduced spectra , transformed to the `` sirius system '' and ranging from 3300 to 10,000  , are shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : blue ] .",
    "some line identifications are given in the last panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bluered ] . in spectra of stars",
    "hotter than the sun we clearly see the balmer lines at 6563 , 4861 , 4340 , 4102   and shorter wavelengths .",
    "cooler stars such as hr 3307 ( @xmath7 car ) and hr 2061 ( @xmath1 ori ) show the infrared ca@xmath21 triplet ( 8498 , 8542 , and 8662  ) and the blended na d lines ( 5890 and 5896  ) .",
    "@xmath6 ori and early b - type stars , such as hr 1790 ( @xmath11 ori ) , hr 2294 ( @xmath8 cma ) , hr 2618 ( @xmath7 cma ) , and hr 4853 ( @xmath8 cru ) , show he i absorption at 4471 and 5876  , though it is difficult to see given the scale of the spectra shown in figs .",

    "14 of @xcite .",
    "one thing to note in our reduced spectra is the strength of the balmer jump in early - type main sequence stars .",
    "this is due to ionization of atomic hydrogen from the first excited state , producing strong absorption shortward of the balmer limit at 3646  .",
    "this results in fainter @xmath22-band magnitudes of such stars .",
    "a much weaker balmer jump is seen in hot giant and supergiant stars .",
    "thus , the balmer jump gives us a photometric tool to measure a combination of the luminosity class and the local acceleration of gravity of hot stars ( log @xmath0 ) .",
    "for example , an a2 v star is 0.30 mag redder in the @xmath23 color index than an a2 iii star @xcite .",
    "@xcite points out that one also needs the rotation rates of the stars to do this properly .",
    "the filter prescriptions originally given by @xcite have been slightly modified by @xcite .",
    "we have adopted the latter . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ubvri ] we show their filter prescriptions , multiplied by an atmospheric extinction function appropriate to cerro tololo , and also multiplied by a function which accounts for the principal atmospheric extinction lines .",
    "this is noticeable in the @xmath24- and @xmath25-band functions .",
    "we then calculated synthetic @xmath3 magnitudes of our target stars using an iraf script written by one of us ( n. b. s. ) .",
    "this script uses an arbitrary zero point for each filter .",
    "we adjusted the @xmath3 zero points to given synthetic magnitudes of the scaled sirius model spectrum that match those of @xcite . if the reader chooses to adopt different @xmath3 magnitudes of sirius than those given in table [ tab : stars ] , then the synthetic magnitudes of the other stars given in the table must be adjusted up or down accordingly .",
    "bessell and murphy s @xmath9-band filter prescription extends to 7400  , while our blue grating spectra stop at @xmath56400  .",
    "we can not obtain synthetic @xmath9-band magnitudes for the cooler stars observed only with the blue grating .",
    "however , we can obtain approximate @xmath9-band magnitudes for the hot stars hr 2618 , 3485 , 4853 , and 4963 by extrapolating the spectra using the rayleigh - jeans approximation .",
    "table [ tab : stars ] gives our synthetic @xmath3 photometry .",
    "[ fig : pmdiff ] shows the differences of our synthetic photometry and the values of @xcite and @xcite , as a function @xmath26 ( for @xmath15 and @xmath9 ) , @xmath27 ( for @xmath24 ) , and @xmath28 ( for @xmath25 ) .",
    "there is no color term for the @xmath9-band differences , but there are non - zero colors terms for @xmath15 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . at zero color",
    "there is no offset between our @xmath9-band magnitudes and those of cousins , but in @xmath15 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 ours are 0.02 to 0.03 mag fainter .    from the aavso online light curve calculator we find that the @xmath9-band brightness of @xmath1 ori was @xmath9 = 0.398 on 2 january 2003 , and @xmath9 = 0.384 on 7 january .",
    "the mean is @xmath9 = 0.391 , which is comparable to our synthetic @xmath9-band magnitude of 0.398 from spectra taken on 6 january 2003 .",
    "this is a good sanity check . on 21 january 2005 ,",
    "when we took the red grating spectra , betelgeuse s brightness was @xmath9 = 0.436 , according to the aavso .",
