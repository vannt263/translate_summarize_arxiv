    "_ ( contribution to a book to be published by world scientific for the occasion of 50 years of quarks ) _",
    "+   +      in the 1950s and 1960s many new particles were found experimentally .",
    "m. gell - mann @xcite and y. neeman @xcite showed that these particles can be fit into an octet ( mesons and baryons ) or a decuplet ( hyperons ) representation of a symmetry group called su(3 ) .",
    "a peculiar feature is that the simplest representation of the group , a triplet , was not realized in nature .",
    "furthermore , it is hard to imagine that these particles were all elementary .",
    "gell - mann @xcite and zweig @xcite independently discovered that if one proposes the existence of three spin 1/2 fundamental particles which gell - mann called quarks , then a meson can be treated as a bound state of a quark and an antiquark , and a baryon can be treated as a bound state of three quarks . to accomplish this feat , however , the fundamental constituents quarks must possess very strange properties : their electric charge must be fractional ( 1/3 or 2/3 of an electronic charge ) , and they must violate the spin - statistics connection .",
    "later , the new quantum number color @xcite was proposed to resolve these difficulties .",
    "this was the birth of the quark model in 1964 .    in the mean time , the popularity of canonical quantum field theories was in decline due to the absence of a viable field theory for the strong interactions .",
    "instead , gell - mann @xcite postulated that the commutation relations derived from spin 1/2 quark fields for the vector and axial vector currents are exact whether or not the quarks exist and whether the underlying symmetry @xmath0 is exact or not .",
    "these current algebras , in combination with pcac ( partially conserved axial current ) @xcite and soft pion theorems provide a framework for extracting dynamical information on strong and weak interactions .",
    "initial applications focused on low energy phenomena .",
    "the first application of current algebra to high energy processes was made by s. adler @xcite who derived sum rules for high energy neutrino and anti - neutrino scatterings . at the time",
    "the prospect for neutrino scatterings was quite remote . j. bjorken @xcite obtained from these sum rules an inequality for high energy electron nucleon scatterings by an isospin rotation .",
    "the inequality showed that the cross sections for electron nucleon scatterings is of comparable size with that for a point - like target , and this could be tested by the ongoing slac - mit experiment at slac .",
    "in an attempt to understand adler s sum rules and bjorken s inequality , bjorken proposed that the structure functions that describe the cross - sections for the inelastic electron scatterings satisfy a scaling property known as bjorken scaling @xcite .",
    "there are two lorentz invariant kinematic variables for the inelastic electron scatterings .",
    "the structure functions depend on the two variables .",
    "bjorken scaling means that in the large momentum transfers , these structure functions become a function of the ratio of the two variables .",
    "bjorken scaling was quickly confirmed by the experiments at slac @xcite .",
    "feynman @xcite interpreted the bjorken scaling as the point - like nature of the nucleon s constituents when they were incoherently scattered by the incident electron .",
    "feynman named the point - like constituents partons .",
    "this is the parton model .",
    "feyman left open the possibility that the partons need not be the quarks .",
    "however , theorists quickly identified the partons with quarks ( in the late 1960s and early 1970s qcd did not exist , and so gluons did not enter the picture ) .",
    "a nucleon consists of three `` valence '' quarks which carry the nucleon s quantum numbers and a `` sea '' of quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "this identification led to many predictions for electron and neutrino ( and antineutrino ) scatterings from a nucleon @xcite .    in the fall of 1968",
    "soon after feynman s parton model was proposed , don levy and we embarked on a comprehensive program @xcite to understand and apply the parton model in a quantum field theory framework .",
    "first , we would like to know under what conditions the parton model could be derived from a quantum field theory .",
    "second , was it possible to apply the parton model to other processes ?",
    "let us state briefly the conclusions of our investigations here .",
    "we showed that the parton model could be derived if the impulse approximation was valid : that during the scattering the constituents behave as if they were free . to accomplish this",
    ", we had to impose a transverse momentum cut - off for the particles that appeared in the quantum field theory @xcite . crossing symmetry in quantum field theory relates deep inelastic electron nucleon scatterings and deep inelastic electron - positron annihilation into a nucleon plus anything else .",
    "we have found the parton model can be applied to the crossed channel reaction .",
    "the structure functions are found to have bjorken scaling as in the scattering case . in search for other processes to apply the parton model , we found at least one : namely , the lepton pair production by proton - proton collision which was under study by christenson , et al @xcite at bnl .",
    "the conditions for applying the parton model were satisfied if the lepton pair was produced by the annihilation of a parton from one proton and an anti - parton from the other proton and the lepton pair mass is sufficiently high .",
    "this is now known as drell - yan mechanism @xcite .",
    "finally , we must specify a particular quantum field theory . at the time",
    ", there was no good candidate for a quantum field theory for the strong interactions .",
    "so our choice to a large extent is arbitrary .",
    "we were guided by simplicity .",
    "if we were to include particles with isospin , then we had to exclude vector mesons .",
    "otherwise , we would have to deal with non - abelian massive vector mesons , and no one knew how to do that .",
    "thus , we settled on a quantum field theory involving a nucleon isodoublet and an isotriplet pions , so that there will be both a spin 1/2 charge carrier and a spin 0 charge carrier .",
    "they interact through a pseudoscalar coupling .    in the following",
    "we will apply our model quantum field theory to elaborate on the points we mentioned above .",
    "it should be pointed out that our emphasis will be on the motivations , principles , the most general results , and what modifications that have to be made after the discovery of qcd .",
    "we should also mention that we have also found a relation between the threshold behavior of the structure functions in the deep inelastic scatterings and the asymptotic behavior of the elastic electromagnetic form factor @xcite , and have studied the semi - inclusive deep inelastic scatterings @xmath1 which gives rise to fragmentation functions @xcite .",
    "but we will not discuss these last two topics any further .",
    "the differential cross - section for the inelastic electron scattering from a nucleon @xmath2 is described by the tensor : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a one nucleon state with four momentum @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the electromagnetic current , @xmath7 is the four momentum of the virtual photon , @xmath8 is the square of the virtual photon mass , and @xmath9 is the energy transfer to the photon in the laboratory system .",
    "an average over the proton spin is understood .",
    "the kinematics is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : epkin ] .",
    "the differential cross section in the rest frame of the proton is given by @xmath10\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the initial and final energy of the electron and @xmath13 is its scattering angle .",
    "we are interested in the bjorken limit of large @xmath14 and @xmath15 with the ratio @xmath16 fixed .",
    "let us work in the infinite - momentum center of mass frame of the electron and proton .",
    "then @xmath17 with the nucleon momentum @xmath18 along the 3-axis .",
    "we go to the interaction picture with the familiar u - matrix transformation @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the fully interacting and bare electromagnetic currents , respectively .",
    "( [ equ : wtensor ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath22 where @xmath23 . in the old fashioned perturbation theory , the state @xmath24",
    "is represented by all the particles that appear just before the electromagnetic vertex , and the state @xmath25 is represented by all the particles that appear right after the electromagnetic vertex ( see fig . [",
    "fig : partsplit ] ) .        from fig .",
    "[ fig : partsplit ] , it is seen that there are two groups of particles after the scattering by the photon , group ( a ) moves along the direction of the initial nucleon momentum @xmath18 , and group ( b ) moves along the scattered momentum @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the momentum of the parton to be scattered by the photon .",
    "each group will have limited transverse momentum relative to their large momentum @xmath18 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "if we schematically denote the energy of the a particular component of @xmath28 by @xmath29 , and the energy of a particular component of @xmath25 by @xmath30 , then with a transverse momentum cutoff introduced for each field particle in the theory , the energy differences @xmath31 and @xmath32 are      where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are typical transverse momentum and mass scales , and eqs .",
    "( [ equ : deltae1 ] ) , ( [ equ : deltae2 ] ) are small compared with @xmath36 , so we can make the substitution in the overall energy momentum conserving dirac delta function in eq .",
    "[ equ : wtensor2 ] , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a constituent in @xmath28 with momentum @xmath39 which is scattered into a constituent @xmath40 with momentum @xmath41 . in other words",
    ", the overall energy conservation implies that the energy is conserved across the electromagnetic vertex .",
    "we should emphasize that we have accomplished this by imposing a transverse momentum cutoff in the underlying quantum field theory and the bjorken limit gives @xmath14 , and @xmath42 .",
    "( [ equ : energy ] ) is a statement of impulse approximation , because the scattering event occurs so suddenly that the constituents involved can be treated as free .",
    "we now make use of the translation operators , completeness of the states @xmath43 and unitarity of the @xmath44 matrix to obtain : @xmath45    energy - momentum conservation across the electromagnetic vertex gives @xmath46 or @xmath47 if we denote by @xmath48 the fraction of the longitudinal momentum carried by the initial parton , @xmath49 then @xmath50    thus , the bjorken scaling variable is identified as the fractional longitudinal momentum carried by the scattered parton .",
    "the structure functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 are related to the longitudinal momentum distribution functions of the initial proton . working out the tensor structure of eq .",
    "( [ equ : limw ] ) , we find that the structure functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 depend only on the bjorken variable @xmath53 ,              our studies preceded the discovery of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) which is a non - abelain gauge theory @xcite with octet colored gluons and triplet color quarks ( at present , there are 3 generations of triplet colored quarks : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 ) .",
    "it has the unique property of asymptotic freedom @xcite that its coupling constant decreases logarithmically with momentum scale @xmath62 .",
    "since 1973 , qcd has been accepted as the correct theory of strong interactions . in this theory",
    "deep inelastic scatterings can be analyzed rigorously .",
    "the main results are :    the moments of the structure functions @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are no longer independent of @xmath62 as they would be if bjorken scaling is exact .",
    "these moments decrease with @xmath62 logarithmically with certain powers which are called anomalous dimensions of twist 2 operators and are calculable in qcd @xcite .",
    "it is possible to relate the more formal analysis of qcd to the more intuitive parton model .",
    "the relations are provided by a set of altarelli - parisi equations @xcite .",
    "these equations describe , as we increase @xmath62 , how a gluon evolves into a gluon pair or a quark - antiquark pair , or a quark evolves into a quark plus a gluon .",
    "these evolutions are described by a set of quantities which are called splitting functions .",
    "moments of these splitting functions turn out to be the anomalous dimensions which appear in the moments of the structure functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "thus , the altarelli - parisi equations offer further insight into the parton model and the working of qcd .",
    "it is therefore interesting to ask if the parton model ideas can be applied to this process .",
    "we will indicate in this section that the answer indeed is yes .",
    "we will only sketch the main ideas .",
    "the details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the cross section for the process ( [ equ : eeannih ] ) is summarized by the two structure functions defined by @xcite @xmath64 then the differential cross section is given by @xcite @xmath65\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the energy of the detected proton and @xmath13 is the angle of the proton momentum @xmath18 with respect to the colliding @xmath67 and @xmath68 beams in the center of mass system .",
    "the two lorentz invariant kinematic variables are defined by      in the present case the ratio @xmath70 . if we follow a similar analysis given to deep inelastic scattering in section [ sec : partonmodel ] , we will find that the two structure functions satisfy bjorken scaling : @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "furthermore , we have      the above relations are similar to the results eq .",
    "( [ equ : disff ] ) for deep inelastic scattering . in the deep inelastic scattering case ,",
    "the bjorken s scaling variable @xmath48 is identified with the longitudinal momentum fraction carried by the scattered parton inside the nucleon .",
    "what is the meaning for the corresponding scaling variable @xmath74 in the deep inelastic annihilation ?",
    "let us follow similar steps as in eqs .",
    "( [ equ : enmom])-([equ : xidef ] ) .",
    "the annihilation process proceeds through the creation of a parton @xmath38 and its anti - parton @xmath40 , followed by the decay of parton @xmath38 into a group of particles which contains the detected nucleon with momentum @xmath5 .",
    "energy - momentum conservation at the electromagnetic vertex gives , @xmath75 or @xmath76    if we denote by @xmath77 the ratio of the momentum @xmath39 of the parent parton @xmath38 to the nucleon momentum @xmath5 , @xmath78 then eq . ( [ equ : enmomann ] ) gives @xmath79 the ratio is larger than unity as it should be since the nucleon can only carry a fraction of the momentum of its parent parton @xmath38",
    "finally , these scaling predictions will receive qcd s logarithmic corrections in @xmath62 @xcite , just as in the case of deep inelastic scatterings .",
    "the field on lepton pair production began with the experiment at bnl by christenson et .",
    "they studied the reaction @xmath80 for proton energies 22 - 29 gev , and the muon pair mass 1 - 6.7 gev .",
    "two features of the data stand out : ( 1 ) the shoulder - like structure near the muon pair mass of 3 gev , and ( 2 ) the rapid fall - off of the cross section with the muon pair mass .",
    "we know now that the shoulder - like structure is due to the @xmath81 which was discovered in 1974 by a muon pair production experiment at bnl @xcite and an @xmath82 colliding beam experiment at slac @xcite .",
    "we got interested in the process ( [ equ : pairprod ] ) for two reasons : ( 1 ) we were looking for applications of the parton model outside deep inelastic lepton scatterings , and ( 2 ) we wanted to understand if the rapid decrease of the cross section with the muon pair mass could be reconciled with the point - like cross sections observed in the deep inelastic electron scatterings .",
    "the key idea in our approach was once again the impulse approximation .",
    "first , we picked an appropriate infinite momentum frame to exploit the time dilation . in this frame , if we were able to establish that the time duration of the external probe is much shorter than the lifetimes of the relevant intermediate states , i.e. @xmath83 then the constituents could be treated as free .",
    "thus , the cross section in the impulse approximation is a product of the probability to find the particular parton configuration and the cross section for the free partons . in the case of lepton pair production from two initial hadrons , @xmath84 the pair production by the parton - antiparton annihilation satisfies the criteria of impulse approximation @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : llprod ] ) .",
    "it is easily shown that the fractional longitudinal momenta of the annihilating partons satisfy @xmath85 where @xmath14 and @xmath59 are , respectively , the pair mass squared and the square of the c.m .",
    "energy of the initial energy of the initial hadrons .",
    "the rapidity of the pair is given by @xmath86      the magnitude and shape of the cross section are determined by the parton and antiparton distributions measured in deep inelastic lepton scatterings : @xmath87 where a color factor @xmath88 is included in anticipating qcd ;      if a photon , pion , kaon , or antiproton is used as the projectile , its structure functions can be measured by lepton pair production @xcite .",
    "this is the only way we know of to study the parton structure of a particle unavailable as a target for lepton scatterings ;      in the rest frame of the lepton pair , the angular distribution is @xmath92 with respect to the hadron collision axis , typical of the spin 1/2 pair production from a transversely polarized virtual photon ;      in this model , the rapid decrease of the cross section with @xmath14 as seen in ( [ equ : pairprod ] ) is related to the rapid fall - off of structure functions as @xmath94 in deep inelastic electron scatterings .",
    "the lepton pair production considered here is the first example of a class of hard processes involving two initial hadrons .",
    "these processes are not dominated by short distances or light cone .",
    "so the standard analysis using operator product expansion is not applicable .",
    "but the parton model works .",
    "soon after our work , berman , bjorken , and kogut @xcite applied similar ideas to large transverse momentum processes @xmath95 induced by deep inelastic electromagnetic interactions . at that time",
    ", it was believed that strong interactions severely suppressed large transverse momenta , therefore , electromagnetic interactions would quickly dominate the large transverse momentum processes .",
    "this was the precursor of the point - like gluon exchanges in qcd .",
    "after the advent of qcd , the basic picture of lepton pair production has been confirmed theoretically and the details have been greatly improved @xcite .",
    "it is no longer a model .",
    "that lepton pairs are produced by parton - antiparton annihilation is a consequence of qcd . in qcd ,",
    "the partons are quarks , antiquarks , and gluons , and the number of color @xmath96 .",
    "the unique property of qcd being an asymptotically free gauge theory makes the parton model almost correct , namely for deep inelastic processes we have @xmath97    in the modern language , the impulse approximation is replaced by the more precise concept of factorization which separates the long distance and short distance physics and the condition ( [ equ : taufact ] ) now becomes @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a typical momentum scale in qcd .",
    "the constituents are almost free , leading to logarithmic corrections to the structure functions @xmath100 factorization for the lepton pair production works in qcd , but in a more complicated manner and it has taken the hard work of many people and many years to establish @xcite .",
    "the main complication arises from the new feature of initial and final state interactions between the hadrons @xcite .",
    "the result is fairly simple to state @xmath101 where the sum over @xmath38 and @xmath61 are over parton species .",
    "the parton distribution functions are the same as those in deep inelastic lepton scatterings with the understanding that @xmath14 is its absolute value .",
    "the function @xmath102 is the parton level hard scattering cross section computable in perturbative qcd and is often written as @xmath103 beside the logarithmic scaling violation , a large transverse momentum of the lepton pair can be produced by recoil of quarks or gluons .",
    "a simple dimensional analysis gives @xmath104 the constant @xmath38 is related to the primordial or intrinsic transverse momentum of the partons .",
    "the full angular distributions in both @xmath13 and @xmath105 depend on input quark and gluon densities and are rather complicated @xcite . for small @xmath34",
    "the @xmath13 dependence is close to @xmath106 even when high order corrections are taken into account . for large @xmath34",
    ", the @xmath13 dependence is expected to be substantially modified @xcite .    many of the predictions have been tested and confirmed by many experiments at fermilab and cern and elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we will not go into the details .",
    "we will only point out that the model is so successful that its data have become an integral component of the global fit together with the deep inelastic lepton scatterings in determining the parton distributions inside a nucleon .",
    "it seems natural to broaden the definition of drell - yan process to mean a class of high energy hadron - hadron collisions in which there is a subhard process involving one constituent from each of the two incident hadrons .",
    "new physics always manifests itself in the production of new particle(s ) .",
    "since the ordinary particles do not carry the new quantum number of the new physics , to discover new physics in a hadron - hadron collider therefore requires annihilation of the ordinary particles to create these new particles .",
    "thus , the drell - yan mechanism is an ideal tool for the new discoveries .",
    "let us mention three important discoveries in the recent past which had employed this process to help :        the discovery of the higgs boson at cern in 2012 @xcite was perhaps the most dramatic example of the utility of the process .",
    "the higgs boson is the last particle that appears in the standard model to have been found .",
    "single higgs bosons are predominantly produced by gluon fusion which is a generalized  drell - yan mechanism \" .    since the first experiment at bnl and the nave model proposed to understand it , both experiments and theory have come a long way .",
    "it is interesting to note that our original crude fit @xcite did not remotely resemble the data .",
    "we went ahead to publish our paper because of the model s simplicity and our belief that future experiments would be able to definitely confirm or demolish the model .",
    "it is gratifying to see that the successor of the nave model , the qcd improved version , has been confirmed by the experiments carried out in the last forty years .",
    "the pair production process has been an important and active theoretical arena to understand various theoretical issues such as infrared divergences , collinear divergences leading to the factorization theorem in qcd for hard processes involving two initial hadrons .",
    "the process has been so well understood theoretically that it has become a powerful tool for discovering new physics .",
    "we can expect to find new applications of this process in the future .      in this paper",
    "we have reviewed the development of our effort to understand bjorken scaling and feynman s parton model immediately after these ideas were proposed .",
    "we chose to study these topics in a relativistic canonical quantum field theory to take advantage of its crossing symmetry , unitarity , etc .",
    "an important input for our program is the impulse approximation .",
    "we discovered quickly that the impulse approximation is severely violated due to large logarithms that are present at high energies and large transverse momenta . to restore the validity of the impulse approximation",
    ", we had to impose a transverse momentum cutoff for each of the particles in the theory .",
    "we then picked the simplest quantum field theory describing nucleons and pions in a pseudoscalar coupling .",
    "we started our program in 1968 , before qcd and asymptotic freedom were known . within this framework , we derived the parton model for deep inelastic lepton scatterings , found that the parton model is applicable to crossed channel of the deep inelastic inclusive electron - positron annihilation into hadrons , and an additional application of the parton model to massive lepton pair production in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "some of the interesting results are presented in this article . in spite of an unrealistic quantum field theory and the transverse momentum cutoff imposed by hand ,",
    "most of our results remain valid today except for mild scaling violations in qcd . our goal was to extract results from general properties of the underlying theory rather than from its specifics . after more than forty years , the subjects that we studied : deep inelastic scatterings , deep inelastic electron - positron annihilation , and lepton pair production , are still very active players in the arena in our quest for our understanding of the inner structure of the elementary particles .",
