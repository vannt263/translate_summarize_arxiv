    "v501aurigae ( w72 , 1rxs j045705.7 + 314234 , hd282600 , tyc  2388 - 857 - 1 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) was detected as an x - ray source by rosat @xcite , and was classified by these authors as a possible new weak - lined t - tauri star ( hereafter wtts ) based on the presence of the lii  @xmath46707 resonance line in low - resolution optical spectra , the h@xmath5 line slightly in emission , and the late spectral type ( k2 ) .",
    "@xcite examined the proper motion of the star and concluded that it is a likely member of the central region of the taurus - auriga star - forming region ( sfr ) .",
    "additional li observations based on higher - resolution spectra of 35 of the candidate wtts by @xcite were published by @xcite , who reported for v501aur only an upper limit to the li equivalent width ( eqw ) of 90  m , along with an h@xmath5 eqw of 0.9    _ in absorption _ , and the same spectral classification as the previous authors .",
    "@xcite revisited many of the candidate wtts from their earlier paper including v501aur , drawing on new high - resolution spectroscopic observations from the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics ( cfa ) as well as the elodie spectrograph at the haute - provence observatory .",
    "they reported a new li measurement of @xmath8  m  from their elodie observations , and obtained effective temperature estimates of @xmath9  k and @xmath10  k from a cross - correlation analysis of the cfa spectra and directly from the k2 spectral type , respectively .",
    "they reported also estimates of the rotational velocity as @xmath11 ( cfa ) and @xmath12 ( elodie ) .",
    "their li measurement was more typical of pleiades - age stars than younger wtts , which , together with the discovery that v501aur is a single - lined spectroscopic binary as revealed by the cfa spectra , led them to be more cautious in claiming wtts status for the object .",
    "nevertheless , on the tentative assumption that it is a member of taurus - auriga and is therefore at a distance of @xmath1140  pc , they used evolutionary models by @xcite to estimate the luminosity ( @xmath13 ) , radius ( @xmath14 ) , and mass ( @xmath15 ) of the star , and assigned it a very young age of @xmath16 ( @xmath17  yr ) .",
    "additional h@xmath5 and projected rotational velocity measurements were reported by @xcite as @xmath18   ( absorption ) and @xmath19 , in good agreement with those of @xcite and @xcite mentioned above .",
    "photometric monitoring of v501aur has been carried out by several authors .",
    "@xcite observed it as part of a sample of 58 wtts detected in the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) .",
    "they were able to derive rotation periods for 18 of their stars , all but one being ascribed to rotational modulation by stellar spots .",
    "the one exception was v501aur , which showed evidence of variability on a very long timescale ( @xmath20 days ) uncharacteristic of wtts , and displayed no appreciable modulation in the @xmath21 colour in their observations , as would be expected in the spot scenario .",
    "they also claimed the star to be a double - lined spectroscopic binary , though this was based on a high - resolution but very low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) spectrum taken at the haute - provence observatory .",
    "@xcite presented a homogeneous set of photometric measurements for wtts extending up to 20 years .",
    "their data were collected within the framework of the rotor program ( research of traces of rotation ) , aimed at the study of the photometric variability of pre - main - sequence ( pms ) objects .",
    "the data set contains rotation periods for 35 out of 48 stars , including v501aur .",
    "our target was observed in several seasons from 1994 to 2004 ( see section  [ photometry ] ) .",
    "the photometry showed wave - like variability of the object with an average period of about 55 days .",
    "v501aur has also been included in an 8.4  ghz vla survey of lithium - rich late - type stars from the rass by @xcite .",
    "the object was detected as a radio source with a radio emission strength of @xmath22  mjy .",
    "@xcite recently used the niri instrument on the 8 m gemini north telescope to carry out a near - infrared high angular resolution survey for stellar and sub - stellar companions in the taurus - auriga sfr , but reported no detections around v501aur .",
    "finally , in a brief study by a subset of the present authors , @xcite presented new @xmath23 measurements confirming the @xmath155 day photometric periodicity .",
    "the photometric data obtained at university observatory jena and star lesn observatory between 2007 and 2013 were used .",
    "based on the cfa spectroscopy ( 1996 - 1997 ) the authors found that v501aur is a single - lined spectroscopic binary with a nearly circular orbit , a large mass function implying a fairly massive companion , and an orbital period of 68.8 days that is distinctly longer than the photometric period .",
    "they speculated that the unseen companion may be a binary , or alternatively that the primary star may be a giant ( implying a much greater distance than previously assumed ) , which might also explain the lack of detection of a main - sequence secondary .",
    "here we present additional spectroscopic and photometric observations of v501aur that motivate us to revisit the object with the following goals : ( i ) to improve the determination of its orbital elements as well as its physical parameters , including the atmospheric properties ( temperature , surface gravity , and the strength of the li and h@xmath5 lines ) ; ( ii ) to better characterize the photometric variability , which is unusual for a wtts , through a comprehensive study of all available observations ; ( iii ) to investigate the difference between the photometric and orbital periods and its implications ; and ( iv ) to present a coherent picture of the true nature of the system based on all available information , including a recent estimate of the parallax of v501aur from _ gaia _ that appears to conflict with the notion of membership in the taurus - auriga star - forming region .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ photometry ]",
    "we present our new photometric observations followed by a detailed period analysis .",
    "section  [ spectroscopy ] describes our new spectroscopic observations and reports an updated spectroscopic orbital solution .",
    "section  [ extinction ] contains a discussion of interstellar reddening . in section  [ properties ]",
    "we review the physical properties of v501aur and re - examine the evidence for membership in the taurus - auriga sfr , presenting a coherent picture of its evolutionary state based on stellar evolution models .",
    "we conclude in section  [ conclusion ] with our final thoughts .",
    "the differential photometry used in this paper was carried out between 2007 and 2016 at four different observatories , two in slovakia and two in germany .",
    "the two in slovakia are the star lesn observatory ( g1 ; 490910n , 201728e ) and the kolonica observatory ( ko ; 485606n , 221626e ) .",
    "the two observatories in germany are the university observatory jena ( gsh ; 505544n , 112903e ) and the michael adrian observatory ( mao ; 495531n , 082441e ) .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     an important information on the nature of v501  aur is provided by the observed x - ray flux and resulting x - ray luminosity . using the rass count rate , 2.8(9)@xmath33 ct  s@xmath34 , the x - ray luminosity for the 1-@xmath35 range of the _ gaia _",
    "distance is from 8.7@xmath36 erg  s@xmath34 to 3.2@xmath37 erg  s@xmath34 .",
    "this is three orders more than a typical x - ray luminosity of late - type red giants , 10@xmath38 - 10@xmath39 erg  s@xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the identification of the x - ray source with v501  aur is , however , questionable .",
    "the position offset of the x - ray source is 19 arcsec and the rass beam size about 30 arcsec .",
    "hence , observations with better resolution are needed prior to any interpretation .",
    "our new photometric and spectroscopic observations of v501aur have enabled us to revisit its properties in the context of previous claims that it is a wtts belonging to the taurus - auriga star - forming region .",
    "our spectroscopic observations reveal it to be a slightly eccentric , single - lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of about 68.8  days and a fairly massive unseen companion .",
    "no signs of eclipses are observed .",
    "we have carried out a detailed investigation of the long - term photometric variability of v501aur using our own new data augmented with observations from several other sources , giving a total time span of two decades .",
    "the changes in the previously known photometric wave ( in both period and amplitude ) , which has an average period of @xmath155  days distinctly shorter than the orbital period , and the concomitant colour variations we have measured , suggest that the variability is caused by photospheric spots appearing at different stellar latitudes on a differentially rotating star .",
    "the long period of the photometric wave and the fairly rapid rotation of the visible component ( @xmath40 ) imply a large radius for the star of @xmath3 .",
    "such a large size is supported by our spectroscopic estimates of the surface gravity giving low values of @xmath413.0 .",
    "this strongly suggests it is an evolved star that must be far behind the taurus - auriga sfr .",
    "the systemic radial velocity of v501  aur , @xmath42 , is also inconsistent with the mean radial velocity of known members of taurus - auriga .",
    "furthermore , our new measurements of the lii  @xmath46707 line show it to be much weaker than is typical for a young t - tauri star , and the h@xmath5 line is not seen in emission , as would be expected . the distance of about 800  pc now known from the trigonometric parallax appearing in the first _ gaia _",
    "data release conclusively rules out a membership in the sfr .",
    "an independent distance estimate based on the minimum size of the star ( @xmath43 ) , its temperature , the apparent brightness , and a measure of interstellar extinction are perfectly consistent with the direct measurement .",
    "thus , the previous classification of v501aur as a wtts belonging to taurus - auriga is overwhelmingly _ not _ supported by available observations .",
    "instead , the scenario that emerges for v501aur , aided by a comparison with stellar evolution models that succeed in matching all observational constraints , is one in which it is a background , non - eclipsing spectroscopic binary projected onto the taurus - auriga sfr , with a luminous , spotted , and fairly rapidly rotating giant star as the primary , and a likely much more rapidly rotating early - type star as the secondary .",
    "the estimated age of the system is roughly 180  myr , according to the models .",
    "the unfavourable luminosity ratio of such a configuration along with the rotationally broadened lines expected for the secondary are sufficient to explain the non - detection of that star in our spectra .",
    "another possible scenario is that the secondary component is a close binary .",
    "v501aur may be related to a group of rapidly rotating giant stars recently identified in the photometry from the _ kepler _ mission @xcite . among them",
    ", we note that kic  10293335 has properties somewhat similar to those of v501aur : @xmath44  days ( from a fourier analysis ) , @xmath45  k , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "interestingly , there are hints that this star may also be a ( single - lined ) spectroscopic binary .",
    "further study of v501aur in the framework of a possible connection to this interesting class of stars would benefit from a detailed chemical analysis , including sensitive diagnostics of evolution such as the cno abundances and the @xmath49c/@xmath50c isotope ratio to help pinpoint its evolutionary state .",
