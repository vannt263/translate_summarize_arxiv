    "success in exfoliating monolayer and few - layer graphene sheets from bulk graphite , combined with progress in their epitaxial growth , has opened up a rich new topic in two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des )  @xcite .",
    "graphene 2des are remarkable for several different reasons .",
    "the fact that they are truly two dimensional on an atomic length scale elevates 2des physics from the low - temperature world to the room - temperature world .",
    "furthermore , they are accurately described by very simple models over very wide energy ranges and yet have electronic properties that can be qualitatively altered simply by stacking them in different arrangements , and by adjusting external gate voltages or magnetic fields .",
    "lastly but not the least , it is relatively easy to access graphene samples and to purify them , which practically promotes the experimental examinations of fascinating theories on graphene 2des .",
    "the basic building block of all graphene 2des is the isolated monolayer , which is described by a massless dirac @xmath0 hamiltonian over a wide energy range  @xcite .",
    "special for graphene , the dirac model is massless , with two weyl points  @xcite of opposite chiralities located at valley @xmath1 and @xmath2 , i.e. , the two inequivalent brillouin zone corners .",
    "the massless dirac model has linear dispersions and chiral quasiparticles , and in the graphene case the chirality refers to the alignment between the direction of @xmath0 momentum and the direction of pseudospin associated with the a / b sublattice degree - of - freedom of graphene s honeycomb lattice .",
    "intriguingly , the two weyl points at valley @xmath1 and @xmath2 are protected by the translational symmetry , a chiral symmetry , and a berry phase @xmath3 .",
    "we will elaborate more on these two features below .    when @xmath4 honeycomb graphene layers are stacked , electronic properties are strongly modified in a way that is controlled by the specific stacking arrangement  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that among all the stacking possibilities , only the rhombohedral ( abc or chiral ) arrangement  @xcite inherits and extends the most interesting features of monolayer graphene , as we now explain  @xcite .",
    "( i ) there are two low energy sublattice sites , as the other sublattice site energies are repelled from the fermi level by the interlayer hopping @xmath5 and thus irrelevant at low energies , as shown in fig .",
    "[ stacking ] .",
    "this suggests that a two - band model provides a useful tool to describe the long - wavelength physics .",
    "( ii ) the low - energy sublattice sites are localized in the outermost layers , at @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and can be separated energetically by an electric field perpendicular to the film .",
    "( iii ) hopping between low - energy sites via high - energy states is an @xmath4-step process which leads to @xmath8 dispersions in conduction and valence bands , and sublattice pseudospin chirality @xmath4 ( or berry phase @xmath9 ) .",
    "( iv ) the low - energy bands are increasingly flat for larger @xmath4 , at least when weak remote hopping processes are neglected , and the opportunity for interesting interaction and disorder physics is therefore stronger .",
    "consequently , in the simplified chiral model , the density - of - states @xmath10 diverges as @xmath11 approaches zero for @xmath12 whereas it remains finite for @xmath13 and vanishes for @xmath14 .",
    "( these properties also have some relevance to more general stacking arrangements since the low - energy hamiltonian of a multilayer with any type of stacking can always be chiral - decomposed  @xcite to a direct sum of abc - stacked layers .",
    "monolayer and bilayer graphene can be viewed as abc - stacked few - layers with @xmath14 and @xmath13 , respectively . )",
    "we refer the family of abc - stacked @xmath4-layer graphene collectively as the chiral 2des .",
    "it follows the properties ( i)-(iv ) that the electronic properties of @xmath4-layer chiral 2des can be well described by @xmath15 band hamiltonians  @xcite @xmath16 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have used the notation @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 labels @xmath1 and @xmath2 valleys .",
    "the pauli matrices @xmath20 act on a pseudospin degree - of - freedom , i.e. , the two low - energy sublattices @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we choose the positive and negative eigenstates of @xmath21 to denote @xmath7 ( bottom layer ) and @xmath6 ( top layer ) , respectively .",
    "the pauli matrices @xmath22 will be reserved to denote the electron spin .",
    "m / s is the fermi velocity in graphene , and @xmath24 ev is the nearest neighbor interlayer hopping energy .",
    "neutral chiral 2des with @xmath25 has been proved to be fertile ground for new many - body physics  @xcite .",
    "because of the large density - of - states and the @xmath9 berry phases near low energy band - contact points , such 2des at zero external fields are susceptible to chiral symmetry breaking , leading to a family of gapped spontaneous quantum hall states distinguished by valley and spin dependent quantized hall conductivities  @xcite . in these states ,",
    "each spin - valley flavor spontaneously transfers charge between layers  @xcite . particularly in high mobility",
    "suspended bilayers  @xcite , reproducible experimental observations  @xcite are in reasonable agreement with original theoretical predictions  @xcite , both of which will be reviewed in this article .",
    "notably , the fermi surface consists of two band touching points at @xmath1 and @xmath2 for charge neutral chiral 2des , which are indeed protected . as implied by eq .",
    "( [ h0 ] ) , the layer pseudospin rotates @xmath4 times faster than the momentum orientation angle .",
    "this amounts to acquiring a berry phase @xmath9 when a quasiparticle circles one of the band - contact points once  @xcite .",
    "the berry phases are opposite for electron and hole bands , and for @xmath1 and @xmath2 valleys .",
    "the quantization of berry phase , instead of being accidental , is directly dictated by the following chiral ( sublattice ) symmetry  @xcite @xmath26 this chiral symmetry requires that at any momentum @xmath27 a state with energy @xmath11 must have a partner state with energy @xmath28 .",
    "the gapless band - contact nature of the spectra of hamiltonians  ( [ h0 ] ) is protected by the chiral symmetry , since any loop enclosing one band touching point has a nontrivial berry phase @xmath29 ( a topological winding number @xmath4 ) and is thus not contractible .",
    "one can always redefine the zero energy at each @xmath27 to respect the chiral symmetry if a @xmath30 term is introduced to eq .",
    "( [ h0 ] ) . in this case , at each @xmath27 the eigenstates do not alter and the berry connection remains the same .",
    "the chiral symmetry is also robust to any perturbation proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "a notable example is the trigonal warping effect  @xcite , in which the additional @xmath31 terms , instead of gapping a spectrum , only split a band - contact point with berry phase @xmath9 into weyl points with berry phase @xmath3 each and @xmath9 in total  @xcite .",
    "however , the chiral symmetry is broken and the energy spectrum acquires a gap ( @xmath32 at @xmath33 ) in the presence of a @xmath34 term  @xcite . in this case , at each @xmath27 the eigenstates becomes pseudospin polarized and the two monopoles at @xmath33 spread out near the two valley centers , producing substantial momentum - space berry curvatures .",
    "of course , even in the presence of the chiral symmetry , the band - contact points can be gapped out , if gauge symmetry or translational symmetry are broken . as two examples , a superconducting gap may open when a chiral 2des is in proximity to a bcs superconductor substrate or electrode  @xcite ; the @xmath1 and @xmath2 valleys may couple to each other and become gapped in pair annihilation by kekul pattern of bond distortions  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our focus will be the chiral symmetry breaking and spontaneous gap ( mass ) generation  @xcite that is driven by electron - electron interactions  @xcite .",
    "because of the large density - of - states and the @xmath9 berry phases near low - energy band touching points , chiral 2des with @xmath25 at zero external fields are strongly susceptible to broken symmetry states  @xcite .",
    "it is of interesting to determine whether the layer pseudospin orientations in model  ( [ h0 ] ) will be driven out - of - plane or acquire an in - plane distortion in the presence of electron - electron interactions  @xcite .",
    "this amounts to asking for each spin - valley flavor whether the chiral symmetry or the rotational symmetry will be spontaneously broken . in this section",
    "we review perturbative renormalization group ( prg ) analysis  @xcite , in which lattice effects are completely ignored and the long - range of the coulomb interaction is not treated explicitly .",
    "the continuum approach is strongly motivated by the low - density of strongly correlated electrons .",
    "the use of short - range interactions is crudely justified  @xcite by appealing to screening considerations , and arguing that the momentum - independent interaction parameters represent an average over the relevant portion of momentum space .",
    "note that the lengthscale , related to the higher energy cutoff @xmath35 mev , is more than @xmath36 times of the graphene lattice constant @xmath37 .",
    "we therefore emphasize  @xcite that unlike the hubbard model where the short - range interactions are the on - site repulsions , the short - range interactions approximation below correctly takes into account the long - range character of coulomb interactions implicitly . in our view models in which interactions are cut off at atomic length scales  @xcite , although technically interesting , are unlikely to be relevant to few - layer graphene",
    ".    interacting bilayer graphene behaves in many ways as if it is one dimensional electron system with linear dispersions , because it has fermi points instead of fermi lines and because its particle - hole energies have a quadratic dispersion which compensates for the difference between 1d and 2d phase spaces  @xcite .",
    "prg analysis of bilayer graphene is inspiring when it is compared with the case for one - dimensional electron gas ( spinless luttinger liquid )  @xcite .",
    "the main merit of the prg is that it treats all virtual processes on an equal footing  @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking in bilayer graphene can be most easily understood by considering only one spin - valley flavor  @xcite .",
    "in such a spinless and valleyless model , pauli exclusion principle allows only one antisymmetrized interaction parameter , i.e. , the interlayer interaction @xmath38 . a prg analysis determines how the bare interaction @xmath38 at the @xmath5 scale is renormalized to @xmath39 at energy @xmath40 by integrating out the high - energy fermion degrees of freedom . a standard calculation yields the following prg flow equation at the one - loop level @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the constant density - of - states per flavor in bilayer graphene .",
    "this flow equation implies a repulsive interaction instability toward a broken symmetry state  @xcite .",
    "more insight into the likely nature of the broken symmetry state which occurs in bilayer graphene can be obtained by using the prg calculations to estimate the long - wavelength static limit of the layer pseudospin susceptibilities  @xcite : @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "the conservation of particle in the two layers at long wavelength implies @xmath45 .",
    "divergences in @xmath46 signal ordered states in which the charge density is transferred between layers for each flavor , breaking the chiral symmetry and producing an energy gap for charged excitations  @xcite .",
    "divergences in @xmath47 or @xmath48 , on the other hand imply broken symmetry states in which the phase relationship between layers is altered and rotational symmetry within the layers is broken  @xcite . the broken rotational symmetry state is usually referred to as the gapless nematic state .",
    "provided that the system has a single continuous phase transition , the ordered state character can in principle be determined by identifying the pseudospin susceptibility which diverges first as temperature is lowered .    in the noninteracting case ,",
    "the band state layer pseudospin structure yields susceptibilities  @xcite @xmath49 these pseudospin susceptibilities capture the contribution of zero - momentum vertical interband quantum fluctuations involving states with energies measured from the @xmath1 and @xmath2 points between @xmath5 and @xmath50 .",
    "the factor of two difference between @xmath46 and @xmath47 demonstrates that the band state is more susceptible to a gap opening perturbation than to a nematic perturbation .",
    "this property can be understood in terms of the layer pseudospin orientations of the band states  @xcite ; in particular a @xmath51 pseudospin effective field is perpendicular to the valence - band pseudospin for all momentum orientations , so that @xmath51 direction fields always yield a strong response . on the other hand @xmath52-@xmath53 plane pseudospin fields",
    "are not in general perpendicular to the valence - band pseudospin and consequently produce a weaker response averaged over momentum orientations . the larger response to a @xmath51 pseudospin effective field",
    "is related to the well - known property  @xcite of bilayer graphene that a potential difference between the top and bottom layers lead to an energy gap at the @xmath1 and @xmath2 points .",
    "when the interactions flow to strong values , the susceptibilities are dominated by their interaction contributions . near the instability the renormalized interaction leads to @xmath54 suggesting that a gapped state breaking the chiral symmetry is most likely  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments  @xcite also appear to rule out the competing family of gapless nematic states  @xcite .",
    "hereafter we will neglect the non physical gapless nematic state breaking the rotational symmetry .",
    "we point out that a more rigorous four - flavor model leads to results that are qualitatively similar , although the prg has a tendency to overestimate the instability toward the gapless nematic state  @xcite .",
    "it is the layer pseudospin orientations of band states that frustrate the in - plane pseudospin distortion and favor the out - of - plane pseudospin alignment  @xcite .",
    "similar spontaneously broken symmetry physics can also be generalized to thicker abc - stacked @xmath4-layer graphene  @xcite . for larger @xmath4 , the low energy bands are increasingly flat and the pseudospin chirality ( berry phase ) is larger , at least when weak remote hopping processes are neglected , leading to larger opening for many - body interaction effects . in the simplified chiral model  ( [ h0 ] ) , the density - of - states @xmath10 diverges as @xmath11 approaches zero for @xmath12 whereas it remains finite for @xmath13 and zero for @xmath14 .",
    "this difference corresponds to the fact that the short - range interactions at tree level are irrelevant for @xmath14 , marginal for @xmath13 , and relevant for @xmath12 .",
    "this indicates even stronger chiral symmetry breaking in @xmath12 films  @xcite . in practice",
    ", however , the increased strength of trigonal warping would eventually dominate the decreased magnitude of interlayer exchange beyond a critical @xmath4 . in recent experiments interaction - driven spontaneous gaps @xmath55  mev and @xmath56  mev",
    "have been observed in suspended bilayers  @xcite , trilayers  @xcite , and tetralayers  @xcite respectively , whereas there has been no evidence for a charge gap in monolayers  @xcite .",
    "similar to the bilayer case , the competing ordered states in @xmath12 films are anticipated to be gapped states  @xcite , which break the chiral symmetry . note that in these systems that have already been accessible in experiment , the many - body spontaneous gaps are larger than the single - particle trigonal warping energies .",
    "now we discuss the electronic properties of @xmath4-layer chiral 2des systems using the ordered state quasiparticle hamiltonians  @xcite suggested by the above prg analysis @xmath57 where the mass term @xmath34 , whose sign is valley- and spin - dependent , breaks the chiral symmetry and produces an energy gap .",
    "we note that the berry curvatures are non - zero only when chiral symmetry is broken  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "the momentum - space monopoles , i.e. , the original band - contact points , become gapped and the berry curvature spreads out near the two valley centers . since @xmath58 the momentum dependence of @xmath59 can be neglected .",
    "the berry curvature  @xcite of the @xmath4-layer chiral 2des is  @xcite @xmath60 where the symbol @xmath61 denotes the conduction ( valence ) band , and the transverse and total pseudospin fields are @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the orbital magnetic moment carried by a bloch electron is @xmath64 for a two - band model with particle - hole symmetry  @xcite . for the chiral",

    "the orbital magnetization is however independent of the band index @xmath70 .    in the presence of an in - plane electric field",
    ", a quasi - electron acquires an anomalous transverse velocity proportional to the berry curvature , giving rise to an intrinsic hall conductivity . based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : berry ] ) , the intrinsic hall conductivity contribution from a given valley and spin is given by  @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the total pseudospin field at the fermi wavevector .",
    "provided that the fermi level lies in the mass gap , each spin and valley contributes @xmath73 to the hall conductivity , with the sign given by @xmath74 .",
    "as we will review in the next section , different broken chiral symmetry states can be classified by their charge , spin , and valley hall conductivities that are determined by the signs of @xmath59 for different valleys and spins  @xcite . for this reason , the broken chiral symmetry states were often referred to as spontaneous quantum hall states .",
    "when spin is ignored only two different types of states can be distinguished : ones in which the @xmath1 and @xmath2 valleys are layer polarized in the opposite sense producing a quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) state with broken time - reversal symmetry ( @xmath75 ) and orbital magnetization , and ones in which the two valleys have the same sense of layer polarization producing a quantum valley hall ( qvh ) state with broken inversion symmetry ( @xmath76 ) and zero total hall conductivity  @xcite .",
    "when spin is included , there are three additional states  @xcite .",
    "the five distinct states in the spinful case can be obtained by each spin choosing to be a qvh state or a qah state .",
    "below we will explain how these states are distinguished by their charge , spin , and valley hall conductivities , by their orbital magnetizations , by their broken symmetries .",

    ". this state preserves time - reversal symmetry but breaks inversion symmetry . besides the layer polarization , the inversion symmetry breaking yields a valley hall effect , analogous to the quantum spin hall effect  @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous mass term in this case can be modeled by @xmath34 which is spin - valley independent .",
    "compared to the other four states , the qvh state has more layer polarization and hence stronger hartree ( electrostatic ) energy cost  @xcite .",
    "the qvh states can be favored experimentally by applying a perpendicular electric field , which breaks the inversion symmetry and produces the layer polarization .",
    "[ 5states](b ) describes the case in which the two valleys are polarized in the opposite sense , toward the top and bottom layers respectively .",
    "the spontaneous mass term can thus be modeled by @xmath77 which is spin independent but valley dependent .",
    "this implies hall conductivity and orbital moment ( or orbital magnetization ) contributions of the same sign for each spin and valley .",
    "this inversion symmetric state , breaks time - reversal symmetry and the valley ising ( @xmath78 ) symmetry , but its spin density is surprisingly everywhere zero .",
    "the total hall conductivity has the quantized value @xmath79 and we refer to this state as the qah state  @xcite .",
    "in addition to its qah effect , this state has a substantial orbital magnetization  @xcite .",

    "as phase i is only observed in the absence of electric field , it is evidently not layer polarized but a symmetric linear combination of the top and bottom layers , or the @xmath1 and @xmath2 valleys equivalently , and thus a valley - kekul state  @xcite .    remarkably in fig .",
    "[ exp4](a ) , in contrast to phase i , phase ii is observed at anomalously small magnetic fields and large electric field , with a landau level gap that extrapolates to a finite zero - magnetic - field intercept .",
    "its appearance at much smaller magnetic field than phase i is reminiscent of the `` all '' state at zero magnetic field .",
    "indeed phase ii is only metastable at zero external fields , most likely because it loses the ordering competition to the laf state at zero electric field and to the qvh state at finite electric fields .",
    "as observed in fig .",
    "[ exp4 ]  @xcite and predicted earlier  @xcite , however , phase ii can be preferred in the presence of both finite electric and finite magnetic fields , since states with different total hall conductivity are most stable at different carrier densities ; moreover , the energy of this phase is lowered by the orbital and spin coupling to the magnetic field and by the compensation of the hartree energy cost of its layer polarization by the electric field .",
    "we emphasize that this state is partially polarized in spin , valley , and layer , as shown in fig  [ 5states](e ) and table  [ table : one ] .",
    "when broken chiral symmetry physics occurs within each spin and valley of a chiral 2des , as suggested by the prg and susceptibility analysis , the spontaneous gap @xmath32 at zero carrier density can be obtained by solving the self - consistent mean - field gap equation  @xcite @xmath107 @xmath108 is the effective interaction strength between electrons near the @xmath1 or @xmath2 valleys , and @xmath109 is a sample area .    for the monolayer case with @xmath14 ,",
    "the instability occurs for @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the dirac - model density - of - states at the ultraviolet energy cutoff scale @xmath112 .",
    "thus , the symmetry breaking would only occur for large interaction strengths .",
    "we can conclude from this observation that the presence or absence of a broken symmetry state in monolayer graphene depends on atomic length scale physics beyond that captured by the chiral model  [ h0 ] with @xmath14 .",
    "it has been established experimentally that the gaps , if present , can not be larger than @xmath113  mev in monolayer graphene  @xcite .    in sharp contrast to the @xmath14 case , the gap equation  ( [ eqn : ngap ] ) always has a solution for any @xmath25 case , no matter how small @xmath108 is .",
    "this is consistent with the weak repulsive interaction instability that is concluded by the prg and susceptibilities analysis  @xcite .",
    "we will focus on the bilayer case below . in",
    "suspended ultra - clean bilayer graphene at zero carrier density , where @xmath59 is small compared to @xmath5 , the solution of the gap equation is given accurately by  @xcite @xmath114 the spontaneous gap @xmath115 mev observed in experiment at zero magnetic field corresponds to a dimensionless interaction strength @xmath116 , close to the value expected to be appropriate for screened coulomb interactions  @xcite .",
    "when the bilayer graphene carrier density is nonzero , it is possible to show that the temperature @xmath117 mass is reduced to  @xcite @xmath118 because of pauli blocking effects in the gap equation .",
    "mean - field theory therefore predicts that the broken symmetry state disappears once fermi energy becomes larger than @xmath119  mev , which corresponds to a carrier density larger than @xmath120 as compared in fig .",
    "[ exp3 ] , both the size of the gap at zero carrier density and the critical carrier density which destroys the gap are therefore roughly consistent with simple mean - field - theory estimates  @xcite .",
    "the smallness of the density fluctuation that destroys the gapped state is consistent with its appearance only in suspended samples .",
    "the measured @xmath121 in fig .",
    "[ exp3](a ) ( as well as in fig .",
    "[ exp1](c ) ) at zero charge density and @xmath122 at zero temperature are in good agreement with the mean - field theory results in fig .",
    "[ exp3](c ) .",
    "the critical temperature at finite carrier density can be further determined by solving  @xcite @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the fermi function at critical temperature @xmath121 .",
    "the solution for @xmath121 as a function of chemical potential and carrier density is plotted in fig .",
    "[ exp3](d ) .",
    "in conclusion , the mean - field - theory estimates and the experimental observations in bilayer graphene are in reasonable agreement with each other .",
    "the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in chiral 2des has provided a new paradigm for many - body physics , i.e. , the spontaneous quantum hall effects near zero magnetic field  @xcite . below",
    "we will briefly discuss a few predictions and phenomena that are relevant to the physics reviewed in this article .",
    "the physical significance of spontaneous charge , valley , and spin anomalous hall effects also exhibits in their edge state spectra  @xcite .",
    "evidently , the qah ( qsh ) states should have protected chiral ( helical ) edge states corresponding to their bulk topological invariants .",
    "similarly , the `` all '' states should also have protected chiral edge states , though the number is reduced by half .",
    "analogous to the helical edge states of qsh states , the qvh as well as the laf state have counterpropagating edge states at different valleys .",
    "importantly , the qvh edge states are not strictly topological and can be gapped out by a sufficiently strong , large - momentum scattering which couples the two valleys , even if the underlying symmetries are still preserved  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore crucial that the valley index remains a good quantum number , for which short - range disorder , interlayer stacking , and electric fields must be smooth on the lattice scale . under this condition",
    ", backscattering is prohibited and the qvh edge states become protected and thus attractive .",
    "graphene edges often have sufficiently strong atomic scale defects that liberate intervalley scattering , and the edge states are thus destroyed .",
    "however , one can create a smooth domain wall that separates two different qvh states and observe robust edge states along the domain wall , since the smoothness of domain wall would prohibit intervalley scattering .",
    "for example , qvh - like edge states were predicted  @xcite to exist along a domain wall that separates an ab and a ba stacked domains in bilayer graphene under an uniform interlayer electric field .",
    "recently , such qvh domain wall modes have been observed  @xcite in a transport measurement .",
    "bilayer graphene is susceptible to a family of unusual broken chiral symmetry states that are rather close in energy .",
    "thus , domain walls , in which the sense of layer polarization of at least one flavor is reversed , are expected to be present in disordered bilayer graphene samples .",
    "a recent calculation  @xcite shows that the metal - insulator transition temperature in bilayer graphene is reduced from mean - field estimates by thermal excitation of domain walls .",
    "the same calculation also demonstrates that the domain walls have interesting microscopic structure related to the topological character of the ordered states  @xcite .",
    "it turns out there are @xmath125 distinct types of domain walls in the spinful case and @xmath126 in the spinless case , each of which has topological domain wall modes  @xcite .",
    "these unusual domain wall modes are anticipated to exhibit novel luttinger liquid behaviors  @xcite .",
    "while the three gapped states without layer polarization respond similarly to an interlayer electric field , which can induce first order transitions at which the total layer polarization jumps , they have distinct responses to zeeman coupling to their spin  @xcite . when an in - plane magnetic field is included , the qah state quasiparticles simply spin - split , leaving the ground state unchanged but the charge gap reduced to @xmath127 .",
    "for a @xmath128  mev spontaneous gap at the zero field , a field of @xmath129  t drives the gap to zero . for the laf state , the in - plane magnetic field induces a noncollinear spin state in which the components of the spin - density perpendicular to the field are opposite in opposite layers , while those along the field direction grow smoothly with field strength and are identical .",
    "most importantly , the gap does not change as the zeeman field increases . as indicated by the mean - field mass terms above ,",
    "a qsh state contains two copies of laf states with opposite signs for different valleys .",
    "in a recent experiment  @xcite , the spontaneous gaps of bilayer graphene have been found robust to the zeeman fields , consistent with that earlier confirmation that the ground state is the laf state . however , this experiment only employed in - plane magnetic fields up to @xmath126  t , which is not sufficiently large enough to influence the observed ground states with gaps @xmath55  mev . a future experiment with a larger in - plane magnetic field",
    "could provide more conclusive evidences .",
    "the qah state and the qvh state are found to have interesting and distinct optical absorption of circularly polarized lights with a frequency close to the spontaneous gap .",
    "both valleys of the qah state only absorb lights with one helicity , whereas different valleys of the qvh state absorb lights with the opposite helicities  @xcite .",
    "one can further analyze the optical absorption for other three broken symmetry states , since they can be viewed as the two spin flavors choosing to be different qvh and/or qah states .",
    "since the two spin flavors break time - reversal symmetry in the same sense , the qah state is the only one that can be distinguished by kerr optical spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "on one hand , each spontaneous quantum hall state at zero magnetic field is adiabatically connected to a quantum hall ferromagnet with the same charge hall conductivity  @xcite .",
    "that said , there is a smooth evolution between the zero - field and high - field broken symmetry states in suspended chiral @xmath4-layer 2des with @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",
    "even for chiral 2des put on substrates , where the chiral symmetry does not occur at zero magnetic field , the quantum hall ferromagnetism  @xcite still occur at sufficiently high magnetic fields .",
    "moreover , an interlayer electric field can also drive quantum phase transitions between different quantum hall ferromagnets .",
    "what is unprecedented is the fact that integer quantum hall effects can occur in ab bilayers and abc trilayers way below @xmath113",
    "t. what is more exotic would be the fractional quantum hall effects near zero magnetic field , which is still elusive .",
    "[ [ kondo - insulators - flat - band - insulators - and - van - der - waals - heterostructures ] ] kondo insulators , flat - band insulators , and van der waals heterostructures ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    finally , we briefly comment on three closely related phenomena .",
    "topological kondo insulators  @xcite have been discovered in @xmath130 recently .",
    "the underlying mechanism is rather similar to the spontaneous qsh states of chiral 2des with @xmath25 . near the fermi energy",
    "the interaction induces an energy gap between the two already inverted bands , a nearly localized - flat @xmath131-band and a @xmath132-derived dispersive conduction band , leading to a transition from a kondo lattice metal to a small - gap topological kondo insulator . in a similar sense ,",
    "the flat - band chern insulators driven by interactions are similar to the spontaneous qah states of chiral 2des with @xmath25 .",
    "an intriguing task is to identify _ realistic _ systems that host topological phases with fractionalized excitations  @xcite , beyond the celebrated fractional quantum hall states .",
    "recently , two dimensional van der waals heterostructures constitute a new class of artificial materials formed by stacking atomically thin planar crystals .",
    "it is likely that exotic broken symmetry physics may occur when one layer is a chiral 2des and the other layers are materials with small dielectric constants .",
    "i would like to thank my main collaborators on this topic , a. h. macdonald and c. n. lau .",
    "i am also indebted to inspiring discussions with many other collaborators on few - layer graphene : w. bao , g. a. fiete , j. jung , c. l. kane , x. li , e. j. mele , h. min , q. niu , h. pan , m. polini , z. qiao , d. tilahun , j. velasco jr . , b. j. wieder , s. a. yang , j. zhu , and k. zou .",

    "a weyl point is two - fold degeneracy near which the effective hamiltonian can be written in the form a two - component weyl hamiltonian with either left or right chirality . in contrast , a dirac point is a four - fold degeneracy near which the effective hamiltonian can be written in the form of massless four - component dirac hamiltonian . a dirac point can be viewed as two weyl points with opposite chirality sit on top of each other .",
    "therefore , a @xmath1 or @xmath2 point in a graphene system is better called as a spin - degenerate weyl point , since the two spin species have exactly the same chirality .",
