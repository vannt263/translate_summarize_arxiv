    "critical phenomena of partial differential equations ( pdes ) associated with the critical parameter can be found in various physical applications .",
    "for example , in @xcite the gravitational collapse of the scalar field was considered .",
    "the critical phenomenon of the gravitational collapse was discovered ; there exists a critical initial mass such that if the initial mass is less than the critical mass , the scalar field eventually disperses .",
    "conversely , it forms a black hole if the value exceeds the critical mass .",
    "if the initial parameter is arbitrarily close to the critical value , scale - invariant behavior of the solution occurs @xcite . for pdes from nonlinear optics ,",
    "a similar phenomenon has been found and studied , e.g. the sine - gordon equation or nonlinear schrdinger equation with a point - like singular potential term @xcite .",
    "for the sine - gordon equation , there exists a kink soliton solution ; this yields a critical behavior once a self - interacting singular potential is placed .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the wave phenomenon in disordered media with a defect .",
    "if the initial velocity of the kink soliton solution exceeds the critical velocity , the kink soliton eventually passes through the potential , which is known as the _ particle - pass_. if the initial velocity is less than the critical velocity , the soliton is either captured by or reflected by the potential , known as the _ particle - capture _ or _ particle - reflection _ ,",
    "since the sine - gordon equation is not integrable when the singular potential term is present , no exact solution is available ; no exact value of the critical parameter is available either .",
    "there are many unknown properties of the solution behaviors in this case . for more detailed study",
    ", we refer the readers to @xcite .",
    "a similar phenomenon has been also found with nonlinear schrdinger equations @xcite .",
    "for example , in @xcite the singular potential term perturbs the soliton propagation .",
    "similar phenomena of particle - pass , particle - capture , and particle - reflection were observed for some critical parameters .    in this paper , we consider the critical phenomenon that is induced by the point - like singular source term in the pdes , such as the sine - gordon equation mentioned above . in particular , we consider the klein - gordon and sine - gordon equations to be perturbed by the singular potential term . for both cases ,",
    "the solution behaviors are highly sensitive to the critical value of the parameter .",
    "determination of the critical value and the mean solution is an important task because the wave or soliton interactions with the local defect should be well understood for better optical communications . in either particle - capture or particle - reflection , the optical signal is not transmitted with the associated parametric value if it is less than the critical value . the signal should be transmitted with some values of the parameter that exceed the critical value for the communication without blocking or trapping @xcite .",
    "finding the critical value is doable but challenging .",
    "there are two reasons .",
    "first , the singular potential is given by the dirac @xmath0-function , so the given pdes are not well - defined . for the sine - gordon equation",
    ", no exact solution is known with the presence of the singular potential term , which means that no analytic form of the critical value is available  only the numerical or real laboratory experimental approach can render the critical value measurable .",
    "the numerical determination of the critical parameter value relies on expensive monte - carlo(mc ) simulations based on the bi - section method .",
    "moreover , it is highly expensive to determine the critical value up to an arbitrary accuracy ( for the sine - gordon case , it is not even known whether the critical value is rational or irrational ) .",
    "furthermore , the numerically obtained critical value depends on the numerical method , considered with given numerical settings such as the truncation number , domain size , final time etc .",
    "due to the singularity in the potential term , the gibbs phenomenon also appears in the finite truncated solution , resulting in a slow convergence .",
    "thus when we talk about finding the critical value , we mean the critical value defined by the numerical method used , not the _ exact _ value from the pdes . this will be explained in detail , using the klein - gordon equation in the paper .",
    "second , although the singular potential term is used to mimic the effect of the local defect , such a model is not perfect .",
    "associated parameters , such as the strength and the location of the singular potential terms , have a great degree of uncertainty .",
    "thus , determining the critical value needs to be understood within the context of the uncertainty analysis . in this paper , as the first step toward thoroughly analyzing these two issues , we propose to use the generalized polynomial chaos ( gpc ) method @xcite for finding the critical value of both the klein - gordon and sine - gordon equations and the associated statistical quantities such as mean solutions around the critical value .",
    "the gpc method has been successfully implemented to analyze the uncertainty quantification for problems such as fluid flows with uncertain initial and boundary conditions , sensitivity analysis , steady - state problems , etc . @xcite . in our proposed method",
    ", we consider the associated parameter that yields the critical phenomenon of the system as a random variable , and assume that we will try to find a critical parameter value with the given numerical setting .",
    "for the klein - gordon equation , the associated parameter is the strength or amplitude of the singular potential term ; for the sine - gordon equation , the associated parameter is the initial velocity of the soliton solution in the presence of the singular potential term that has a fixed amplitude .",
    "the original equations are then parameterized by the random variable and the solution of the parameterized equations is obtained by the gpc method .",
    "that is , the solution is expanded by the orthogonal polynomials in the random space .",
    "the associated orthogonal polynomials are determined by the probabilistic nature of the random variable , which is the critical parameter in our case .",
    "for example , if the random variable has the uniform probability density function ( pdf ) , the associated polynomial is the legendre polynomial ; if the pdf is normal distribution , the associated polynomial is the hermite polynomial @xcite .",
    "we first consider the klein - gordon equation with the singular potential and find some conditions for the critical phenomenon .",
    "the klein - gordon equation with the singular source term has been considered in various studies .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the singular source term is considered in adopting the model , the meson theory , that the particle mass varies with space and time . in @xcite ,",
    "two @xmath0-functions are used as the singular potentials for schrdinger equation and the corresponding eigenfunctions are derived using the weyl - titchmarsh - kodaira ( wtk ) spectral theorem . in @xcite , the klein - gordon equation with the singular defect was considered and the chaotic behavior of the solution is studied .",
    "however , not every singular potential term yields the critical phenomenon .",
    "we consider the self - interacting singular potential term and show the existence of the critical phenomenon with a certain type of boundary condition .",
    "that is , the energy norm increases , vanishes , or decreases if the parameter value exceeds , is equal to , or is less than the critical value .",
    "the critical value of the parameter is obtained analytically in this case , which makes it possible to do an error analysis . for the critical value",
    ", we assume the uniform pdf and use the legendre polynomial for the expansion .",
    "the resulting deterministic equations are solved using the chebyshev collocation method with the consistent formulation for the dirac @xmath0-function @xcite .",
    "once the expansion coefficients are obtained , the solution is reconstructed for various values of the parameter .",
    "using the fact that the energy norm remains constant for the critical value when the time is large , the invariant point is found as the critical value . the mean solution",
    "is also found by the first gpc mode .",
    "we compare the gpc approach and the mc approach .",
    "then we apply the same method for the sine - gordon equation . the sine - gordon equation with singular potential terms",
    "is also found in much of the existing literature .",
    "the singularly perturbed solution of the sine - gordon equation shows many interesting mathematical structures , such as the fractality , self - similarity , etc .",
    ". moreover , such an equation yields the critical phenomenon associated with the critical parameter , as explained above briefly . in our work",
    ", we use the initial velocity of the soliton solution as the random variable , and try to find the critical initial velocity around which the particle - pass , particle - capture , and particle - reflection occur . for the random variable , we consider both the hermite and legendre polynomials  that is , the normal and the uniform distributions as the pdf . unlike the klein - gordon equation ,",
    "the reconstruction of the solution using the gpc method is not obtained directly .",
    "this is because the receiving soliton signal has two extreme cases , i.e. _ transmitted _ or _ not - transmitted _ , and because of the nonlinearity .",
    "the extreme solution behavior renders the pdf as the two @xmath0-function - like pdfs . for the particle - capture , the amplitude of the tail at the domain exit is @xmath1 ; it vanishes eventually for the particle - pass .",
    "such strong discontinuity in the solution behavior causes the gibbs phenomenon in the reconstruction .",
    "these two extreme cases are not separable in the reconstruction . in the paper",
    ", we show such non - separable reconstruction for both the hermite and legendre cases .",
    "thus instead of using the reconstruction by the gpc method , we use the gpc mean for the determination of the critical value . in this case , the legendre gpc method yields much faster convergence than the hermite gpc method .",
    "numerical results show that the legendre gpc method determines the critical value very efficiently and accurately .",
    "the determined critical value agrees well with the value found by the many direct mc simulations .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "gpc analysis for the singularly perturbed pdes by the dirac @xmath0-functions has not been thoroughly studied in existing literature . in particular , for the nonlinear optics equations with a singular defect in the disordered media , the uncertainty quantification is necessary .",
    "this is because the defect is defined in the highly localized regime and thus contains a high degree of intrinsic uncertainty . in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "some linear wave equations with the singular source term were considered with the legendre pc method .",
    "our current work takes the first step to investigate the uncertainty quantification of nonlinear optics equations , with the source term confined in the highly localized regime .",
    "the paper is composed of the following sections . in section 2 , the klein - gordon equation with the singular source term",
    "is considered . in this section ,",
    "we show that there exists a critical phenomenon and find the exact value of the critical parameter value . in section 3 ,",
    "we briefly explain the gpc method and derive the gpc expansion of the klein - gordon equation using the legendre polynomials . in section 4 , numerical methods used for the numerical approximation of the deterministic equations derived in section 3 are explained including the consistent method for the approximation of the dirac @xmath0-function . in section 5 ,",
    "numerical results of the gpc method for the klein - gordon equation are given .",
    "comparison between the mc method and the gpc method is given .",
    "in section 6 , the critical phenomenon for the sine - gordon equation is explained .",
    "the method of finding the critical initial velocity is explained using the pdf of the receiving signals and the gpc mean value .",
    "the hermite gpc method is presented . in section 7 , the legendre gpc is used for the sine - gordon equation and the deterministic equations are derived .",
    "numerical results and remark on the error are presented . in section 8",
    ", we briefly outlined the gpc method for the case that the randomess is in the amplitue of the singular potential function and explain that the same gpc method can be applied to this case . in section 9 , concluding remark and future works are presented .",

    "in this paper , we proposed an efficient method using the gpc method to find the critical parameter values and the related statistical quantities for the klein - gordon and sine - gordon equations with a point - like singular potential function . by assuming the unknown critical parameter values as a random variable , and expanding the solution in the orthogonal polynomials associated with the random variable , we computed the critical parameter with much less computation than the mc approach . for the klein - gordon equation ,",
    "the critical parameter is associated with the amplitude of the singular potential function . using the gpc reconstruction of the solution",
    ", the invariant point is found to be the critical parameter value . for the sine - gordon equation ,",
    "the initial velocity of the soliton solution is used as the random variable . for this case , both the hermite and legendre gpc methods are used . due to the nonlinearity and the @xmath0-function like pdf of the receiving signals , the reconstruction could not be used ; the gpc mean was used instead .",
    "the legrendre gpc mean converges quickly , and it efficiently and accurately determines the critical parameter value .",
    "as our numerical results show , the gpc method offers several advantages in finding the critical value as compared to the mc method .",
    "first of all , one can avoid the large number of individual simulations for different parametric values .",
    "our proposed method suggests that , with a small number of mc simulations , it is possible to make the first guess about the critical value .",
    "once the first guess is made , one can apply the gpc method to narrow down or pinpoint the critical value accurately and efficiently .",
    "moreover , regarding the gpc method for the sine - gordon equation , the stochastic variable appears only in the initial and boundary conditions , and does not appear in the main pde . to perform the integration related to @xmath29 , one can use the legendre - gauss quadrature for the legendre chaos and gauss - hermite quadrature for the hermite chaos and obtain a fast convergence . in this paper , only @xmath453 quadrature points are used . adopting the quadrature rule , one can easily speed up the whole process .    during our study , we also found a limitation of the gpc method regarding the determination of the initial critical velocity or the critical amplitude of the singular potential term for the sine - gordon equation .",
    "that is , we could not use the reconstruction constructed by the gpc modes to find the pdf of the receiving solutions due to the non - linearity and non - separability related to the gibbs phenomenon of the spectral method . despite this limitation , we find that the gpc method works well for finding the critical values for the singularly perturbed klein - gordon and sine - gordon equations . since no significant gpc analysis exists for the singularly perturbed pdes by the dirac @xmath0-function , our study could be a good resource for this type of research . in our future work , we will apply a similar gpc method for different pdes , such as the nonlinear schrdinger equations with singular potential terms .",
    "we will also consider more general types of uncertainties associated with the singular potential term , for which more than one random variables are involved and the gpc expansion should be in the multi - dimensional random space . to reduce the complexity due to the dimensionality , we will attempt to use the gpc collocation method with the fast sparse grid methods @xcite",
