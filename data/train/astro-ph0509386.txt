    "recent imaging and spectral observations of clusters of galaxies by chandra and xmm - newton have significantly altered our view about clusters of galaxies .",
    "in particular , dynamical effects of infalling subgroups have been recognized in the form of cold fronts and shock fronts ( e.g. , @xcite ; markevitch , vikhlinin 2001 ; @xcite ) . in the coma cluster , for example , an x - ray image showed gas heating between the ngc  4839 subcluster and the main cluster @xcite .",
    "such features clearly indicate that a subcluster merger is indeed taking place , and we can study how the gas is heated and how the extra energy is transferred into the surrounding space .",
    "high - sensitivity imaging spectroscopy of subclusters in the cluster outskirts will , therefore , produce important knowledge about the evolution of clusters .",
    "ic  310 ( @xmath3 ) is an s0 galaxy located in the southwest of the perseus cluster ( @xmath4 ) at an apparent distance of about @xmath51 mpc from the cluster center .",
    "this galaxy is known as a head - tail radio galaxy ( sijbring , de bruyn 1998 ) , indicating that the radio lobe with a length about 350 kpc ( @xmath6 ) is extended to the southwest direction , parallel to the line connecting ic  310 and the center of the perseus cluster .",
    "this suggests that the galaxy may be moving toward the cluster center .",
    "de bruyn and brentjens ( 2005 ) have also detected significant polarized emission from a region close to ic  310 from low - frequency observations .",
    "@xcite suggest a substructure around ic  310 from the pspc image .",
    "an x - ray observation of ic  310 region is , therefore , an interesting case for studying any effect of subcluster motion on the ambient plasma around ic  310 .",
    "the x - ray halo , if it is confirmed , can be used to probe the interacting features between the galaxy and the cluster gas .",
    "the galaxy ic  310 also has its own scientific interest , such as time variability and fe line feature .",
    "the luminosity measured by rosat ( @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 , @xcite ) and asca ( @xmath9 erg s@xmath8 , @xcite ) suggests that this galaxy holds an active nucleus .",
    "each spectrum was fitted well by a single power - law model with a spectral photon index of 3.7 and 2.1 with rosat and asca , respectively .",
    "the temperature map of the perseus cluster obtained with asca showed an extended cool emission with @xmath10 kev around ic  310 @xcite .",
    "this paper reports on the results from an xmm - newton observation of the ic  310 region .",
    "we use @xmath11 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 , @xmath12=0.3 , @xmath13=0.7 in this paper . at a redshift of 0.0189",
    ", 1@xmath14 corresponds to 23.7 kpc .",
    "the xmm - newton observation of ic  310 was carried out on 2003 february 26 , for 29.4 ks .",
    "all of the epic cameras were operated in the full frame mode , and the medium filter for mos and the thin filter for pn were used .",
    "data reduction and analysis were performed by employing sas version 6.0 , ciao 3.2 , and heasoft version 5.3 .",
    "data of this observation obtained with xmm - newton was affected by high - background flares . the data - cleaning method used in @xcite and pratt and arnaud ( 2002 ) were employed in event selection .",
    "first , we checked the light curves in the high - energy bands of 1012 kev for mos and 1214 kev for pn , where the events were dominated by particle background due to soft protons .",
    "good time intervals ( gtis ) without background flares were selected from the light curves using conservative `` generic cuts '' , in which the count rate , @xmath15 , was limited by @xmath16 counts s@xmath8 for mos(pn ) , respectively .",
    "second , we applied the gtis and selected the photon events with patterns 012 for mos and 04 for pn , and flag = 0 .",
    "we calculated the count - rate distribution with 100  s intervals , and then obtained new gtis by requiring all of the count rates to be within @xmath17 around the mean . in this way , we iterated the process until the variation of the number of usable data in a step reached less than 5% compared with the previous value .",
    "the final count rates were 3.265.31 counts s@xmath8 for mos1 , 3.105.04 counts s@xmath8 for mos2 , and 19.327.9 counts s@xmath8 for pn .",
    "after the above data selection , the remaining exposure times were 25.0 , 24.9 , and 19.2 ks for mos1 , mos2 , and pn , respectively .",
    "we further needed to subtract the non x - ray background and the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) . in a spectral analysis of ic  310",
    ", we used its outer annulus as the background , as described later . for analyzing the icm",
    ", we used a background event data set created from blank - sky observations in read and ponman ( 2003 ) . for the background files we applied the same selection criteria for the source event .",
    "the source - to - background count rate ratio was 0.90 for mos1 , 0.94 for mos2 , and 1.16 for pn calculated from the count rates in the 1012 and 1214 kev for mos and pn .",
    "we rescaled the background spectra by rewriting the backscal header keyword according to these ratios @xcite . noting that the pn camera is considerably sensitive to background flares @xcite",
    ", we therefore examined the results by changing the background normalizations by @xmath18 to assess any systematic uncertainties .    to make a correction for vignetting effects ,",
    "the photon - weighting method of @xcite , as implemented in the sas task `` evigweight '' , was applied to each source file and background file . for each event , this task computed the corresponding weight coefficient , defined as the ratio of the effective area at the photon position and the energy to the central effective area at that energy . when extracting spectra and images for specified energy bands , each event was weighted by this coefficient .",
    "point sources were excluded by the sas task `` edetect '' for all the event files . throughout the paper we used the galactic value of @xmath19 @xmath20 ( dickey , lockman 1990 ) in the direction of ic  310 as the absorption for spectral analysis .",
    "an x - ray image of the whole mos and pn fields in the energy band of 0.510 kev is shown in figure [ fig : image - smth ] .",
    "we made corrections for exposure and vignetting and adaptively smoothed the image .",
    "the gaps between the ccd chips are still seen in the image .",
    "the icm emission is obviously brighter towards the center of the perseus cluster , which is located in the northeast direction .",
    "the bright source at the center is ic  310 , and apparently neither x - ray halo nor substructure is associated with the galaxy in the image .",
    "we first looked into ic  310 and its immediate region within a radius of @xmath21 . in this region , since the brightness variation is less than 5% , we can assume the icm distribution to be uniform .",
    "the radial profile , centered on ic  310 , for the mos1 data of the exposure - corrected count rate in the energy band of 0.51 kev is shown in figure [ fig : ic310-radial ] . the radial profile was fitted well with the point spread function ( psf ) and a constant , which was the sum of the nxb , cxb , and icm emissions .",
    "thus , the x - ray emission is considered to come from a point source , which is likely to be the central agn of ic  310 .",
    "( 8cm,5cm)figure2.eps    we extracted the source spectrum from the central circle with a radius of 2@xmath22 , and the background data were taken from an annulus between radii of @xmath23 .",

    "these features suggest that the icm in this region is compressed by the pressure of the infalling gas associated with the ic  310 subcluster .",
    "the pressure , @xmath78 , and the emissivity , @xmath79 , can be expressed in terms of the electron density , @xmath80 , and the temperature , @xmath81 , as @xmath82 and @xmath83 , which gives @xmath84 .",

    "the temperature excess is about 10% compared with the smooth trend of the temperature gradient in the present field of view .",
    "thus , the pressure in this region is estimated to be @xmath87 higher than the surrounding region .",
    "we can break down the general merging process into two steps : first , the local temperature of the icm is raised by shock heating or compression heating , and then the temperature of the whole cluster gradually increases due to growth of the gravitational potential after a merger .",
    "the observed small hump in the brightness and temperature around ic  310 suggests that the system is in a stage between the first and second steps .",
