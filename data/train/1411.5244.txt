    "in this paper we continue the analysis started in @xcite , concerning the behavior of the eigenvalues of the magnetic schrdinger operator @xmath1 as the pole @xmath2 moves inside of @xmath3 and eventually hits the boundary @xmath4 . here",

    "though the magnetic field vanishes almost everywhere , its presence affects the spectrum of the operator , giving rise to the so called aharonov - bohm effect @xcite .    with no additional effort with respect to the standard eigenvalue problem",

    "we will reserve the notation @xmath15 , @xmath16 for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the laplacian with weight @xmath17 in @xmath3 and with zero boundary conditions ( again increasing and counted with their multiplicity ) .",
    "of course , our main interest is the case @xmath18 .",
    "the study of the behavior of the eigenvalues and the link with the nodal domains of the corresponding eigenfunctions is motivated by its relation to spectral minimal partitions , see @xcite .",
    "it has been proved in @xcite that , in dimension 2 , if all the clustering points of a minimal partition have an even multiplicity , then the partition is nodal . the results in @xcite establish a strong relation between the minimal partitions having points with odd multiplicity with the nodal domains of aharonov - bohm eigenfunctions .",
    "the main results obtained in @xcite and @xcite in connection with this topic concern the critical points of the map @xmath19 in particular , in @xcite the authors have analyzed the relation between such critical points and the nodal properties of the corresponding eigenfunctions . to this aim , let us recall the definition of order of vanishing of a function @xmath20 at an interior point @xmath21 .",

    "we address the study of the behavior of the magnetic eigenvalues as the pole approaches the boundary of the domain , starting from the observation that , since simply connectedness is restored when the pole lays on the boundary , there holds    [ theorem : continuity ] let @xmath5 open , bounded and simply connected . for every @xmath41 we have that @xmath42 as @xmath43 .",
    "our first aim is to obtain an expansion similar to when the point @xmath21 is on the boundary @xmath44 .",
    "it is worthwhile noticing that the techniques that were developed in @xcite , based on the application of local inversion methods , hardly extend to the study of the behavior at the boundary .",
    "for this reason , we propose here a different and more efficient approach , based on the min - max characterization of the eigenvalues .",
    "another phenomenon enlightened by the numerical simulations in @xcite attracted our attention .",

    "of course , by the diamagnetic inequality , @xmath45 for every @xmath2 .",
    "a more detailed analysis suggests that the different behaviors are related to the position of the pole with respect to the nodal lines of @xmath16 .",
    "if the pole @xmath40 moves from @xmath44 along a nodal line of @xmath16 , then the nodal line of @xmath46 is shorter than the one of @xmath16 , locally for @xmath40 close to the boundary , see figures [ fig : phi_3 ] and [ fig : phi_3a ] .",
    "this determines a decrease of the energy : we can observe in figure [ fig : lambda_3_a ] that @xmath47 for @xmath40 approaching the point @xmath48 along the symmetry axis of the circular sector .",
    "conversely , if @xmath40 moves from @xmath44 not on a nodal line of @xmath16 as in figures [ fig : phi_2]-[fig : phi_2a ] , this creates a new nodal line in the magnetic eigenfunction and consequently an increase of the energy .",

    "note that , whereas for @xmath23 a zero of order @xmath26 corresponds to @xmath25 arcs of nodal lines meeting at @xmath21 , for @xmath49 a zero of order @xmath26 corresponds to @xmath57 arcs of nodal lines meeting at @xmath21 .",
    "this is due to the fact that we are considering zero boundary conditions .",

    "denote by @xmath61 any such piece of nodal line .",
    "then there exists @xmath62 , not depending on @xmath40 , such that @xmath63    the study of the case when the pole approaches @xmath4 at a point where no nodal lines of @xmath16 end , requires additional work .",

    "<S> we can predict both the rate of convergence and whether the convergence happens from above or from below , in relation with the number of nodal lines of the @xmath0-th eigenfunction of the laplacian . </S>",
