    "in electoral competitions many candidates compete for one or few seats .",
    "their success can range from landslide victory to complete failure with only a handful of votes received .",
    "how does this huge variability come about ?    in 1999 costa filho et al .",
    "studied vote statistics in brazilian parliamentary proportional elections . in this kind of elections , at odds with what occurs in the us , in each electoral district , a few to a few dozens seats are awarded simultaneously , and the number of seats won by a party is proportionate to the number of votes received .",
    "costa filho et al .",
    "considered all candidates , winners and losers , regardless of their electoral district or political affiliation and computed the histogram of the number of votes received by each of them . in the central range of the number of votes , the histogram has a regular profile , where the number of candidates receiving @xmath0 votes appears inversely proportional to @xmath0",
    "this means that the number of candidates who obtained 1000 votes , say , is approximately 10 times higher than the number of candidates who collected 10000 votes .",
    "this type of analysis neglects a factor that is fundamental in the political life of most countries : the influence of parties .",
    "a great deal of the electoral success of a candidate depends on the popularity of the party s political agenda he / she is running for .",
    "the observed histogram reflects the complex intertwined effect of the competition among parties and the competition among different candidates within parties .",
    "given the peculiarities of the specific political landscape of each country , one can hardly expect to see similar results across different countries .",
    "for this reason , we have proposed a different analysis for proportional elections where voters select a party and in addition express a preference for one of the candidates within the party list . to disentangle the role of the party and the role of the candidate ,",
    "the key variable is not the absolute candidate performance , expressed by the number of votes obtained , but the performance relative to the average performance of competitors within the same party . for each party list , we divide the number @xmath0 of votes collected by each candidate by the average score @xmath1 of all candidates in the list .",
    "the histogram of the relative performance @xmath2 turns out to be not only very stable for different elections in the same country , but also across countries [ fig . 1 ( left ) ] .",
    "the generality of this result , and the stability of the performance curve over more than half a century , suggests that we are facing a basic feature of social dynamics , independent of the cultural , historical , economic and technological context where the elections took place .",
    "we model the electoral campaign of candidates as a word - of - mouth process , starting from the candidates and branching out to the community of voters , through their social relationships .",
    "each candidate convinces his / her immediate contacts with a certain probability @xmath3 .",
    "only voters who have not yet made up their mind may be convinced to choose a candidate .",
    "convinced voters , in turn , become activists and campaign in favor of the candidate they have chosen .",
    "the number of contacts of each individual is a random variable @xmath4 , broadly distributed as @xmath5 to account for the large variability in personal inclinations and social stance .",
    "the process stops when each voter has picked a candidate .",
    "the model yields a distribution of candidates performance which matches well the empirical one [ fig .",
    "1 ( left ) ] and is rather robust with respect to variations of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath6 .",
    "it turns out that the most successful candidates are those who manage to acquire the largest number of voters in the initial stages of the process . indeed , with an initially high number of activists on their side",
    ", they may target and eventually gain a high number of supporters , thus limiting the opportunities of their competitors .",
    "imitation and adaptation are the main features of the social atom , and frequently overrule the individual freedom to make decisions . knowing how people s decisions are affected by those of their contacts is fundamental in marketing , policy making , panic situations , etc .",
    "borghesi et al . have used space - resolved election data to address this issue .",
    "they focused on the main decision of a voter : shall i vote or not ?",
    "turnout statistics are available at the municipal level for many countries and years . for",
    "each municipality one can easily extract the geographical location as well . in this way it is possible to check whether there are spatial correlations between turnout rates of different towns , i.e. whether the decision of many people to go to vote ( or not to go ) in one place is related to the behavior of the voters in nearby places .",
    "borghesi et al . studied the logarithm of the ratio between the number of registered voters who participated in each election and the number of those who did not .",
    "the histogram of this variable , called logarithmic turnout rate ( ltr ) , is a skewed bell - shaped curve that , after proper rescaling , is essentially the same in different countries and elections , for municipalities having approximately the same population .",
    "the main result of the analysis , however , is that participation to elections is not independent in different places .",
    "turnout rates are correlated over long ranges in space [ fig .",
    "1 ( right ) ] : quantitatively , the correlation function of ltr decays logarithmically with the distance r between the locations ( @xmath7 ) , where @xmath8 is of the order of the size of the country .",
    "the phenomenology uncovered can be reproduced in terms of a decision model where a voter actually participates to the election only if his own propensity to vote overcomes a threshold .",
    "the propensity of each voter is modeled as a continuous unbounded variable , resulting from the sum of three contributions : an idiosyncratic disposition ( specific to each individual and varying in time ) , a city - dependent term ( with short - scale spatial correlations ) and a slowly varying `` cultural field '' . the latter transports ( in space ) and keeps the memory ( in time ) of the collective intentions and is responsible for the long - range spatial correlations of turnout rates .",
    "the evolution of this cultural field is affected by two types of mechanisms .",
    "people travel to neighbouring cities and interact with acquaintances , carrying their own local cultural specificity and exchanging ideas and beliefs . in so doing",
    ", cultural differences between near areas tend to narrow and this implies that the cultural field undergoes a diffusion process over geographically separated locations .",
    "the mood of the community in a given area may also be influenced by special events , like the closing down of a factory , or the construction of new infrastructure , which can be modeled by a random noise term .",
    "the cultural field thus obeys a diffusion equation in the presence of random noise , whose solution , after a transient leading to stationarity , displays the same spatial correlation profile found in the electoral data .",
    "the fit of the model predictions with the empirical distributions reveals that the equilibration time of the cultural field dynamics is very long , of the order of a century , which is consistent with the observed historical persistence of the voting habits in different areas of a country .",
    "the findings we have discussed confirm that elections are phenomena that can be understood quantitatively with the concepts and tools of physics .",
    "this new line of research has just started to scratch the surface of the wealth of information contained in electoral data .",
    "it promises to shed light on the decisional processes of voters , with potential strong impact on the policy of governments and parties , the design of electoral systems and the organization of political campaigns .",
