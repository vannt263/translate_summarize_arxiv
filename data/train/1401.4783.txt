    "based on the pioneering ideas of feynman and lloyd  @xcite , and bolstered by developments in technology and methods for manipulation and control , the field of quantum simulation is at the current frontier of physics research  @xcite .",
    "its overarching goal is to help us understand the behavior of complex quantum many - body systems by studying their simpler , highly - controllable counterparts .",
    "the field has already matured enough to allow realizations of various quantum spin models , models with bosonic degrees of freedom , and even of those that go beyond the conventional low - energy physics paradigm  @xcite . in particular , polaronic systems have quite recently attracted attention among researchers in the field , as evidenced by the proposals for simulating such systems with trapped ions  @xcite , cold polar molecules  @xcite , rydberg atoms or ions  @xcite , and superconducting ( sc ) circuits  @xcite",
    ".    conceived by landau and pekar as a by - product of their investigation of charge carriers in polar semiconductors  @xcite , the polaron concept has played a pivotal role in studies of electron - phonon ( e - ph ) interaction ever since  @xcite .",
    "it envisions an excess carrier ( electron , hole ) in a narrow - band semiconductor ( or an insulator ) strongly interacting with the host - crystal lattice vibrations .",
    "the effective mass of the carrier is increased  compared to the bare - band value  due to a self - induced lattice deformation that causes an effective `` dressing '' of the carrier by virtual phonons ( self - trapping ) .",
    "polaronic carriers have been found in materials ranging from amorphous semiconductors  @xcite to colossal - magnetoresistive oxides  @xcite to undoped cuprates  @xcite .",
    "more recently , polaronic behavior has been identified in cold - atomic systems  @xcite .",
    "besides , the generalized polaron concept includes almost any instance of a quantum particle strongly coupled to a bosonic environment , giving rise to a field - theoretic model of a fermion interacting with a scalar boson field .    in systems with short - range e - ph coupling , a typical size of the phonon cloud around a carrier",
    "does not exceed a unit cell of the host crystal ( small polarons ) .",
    "such carriers are usually studied within the framework of the holstein molecular - crystal model , a paradigm for the polaron - crossover problem  @xcite .",
    "it describes purely local  hence momentum - independent  interaction of tightly - bound electrons with dispersionless ( einstein ) phonons . owing to a large body of work over the past five decades  @xcite , both static and dynamical properties of this model",
    "are well understood by now .",
    "recent small - polaron studies have , however , focussed on strongly momentum - dependent e - ph interactions  @xcite .",
    "an important example is furnished by su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) coupling ( also known as peierls - type or off - diagonal coupling ) , which accounts for the dependence of electronic hopping integrals upon phonon states and has a significant bearing on transport properties of @xmath3-electron systems , such as organic semiconductors  @xcite , carbon nanotubes  @xcite , and graphene - based nanostructures  @xcite .",
    "such strongly momentum - dependent couplings , with vertex functions that depend both on the electron and phonon quasimomenta , are also relevant for fundamental reasons .",
    "namely , they do not belong to the realm of validity of the gerlach - lwen theorem  @xcite , which asserts that ( single - particle ) e - ph models generically show smooth dependence of the ground - state energy on the coupling strength .",
    "while this theorem was long believed to be of quite general validity , it applies only to momentum - independent ( holstein - like ) couplings and those that do depend on the phonon- but not on the electron quasimomentum .",
    "the latter are exemplified by the `` breathing - mode '' ( bm ) coupling  @xcite , relevant in the cuprates .",
    "the field of sc qubits  @xcite was revolutionized by the development of circuit quantum electrodynamics ( circuit qed )  @xcite , which allowed both fast quantum - gate realizations  @xcite and demonstrations of many quantum - optics effects .",
    "quite recently , circuit qed has come to the fore as a versatile platform for on - chip analog quantum simulation  @xcite .",
    "spurred by some recent advances in the realm of sc quantum devices , especially the striking increase in achievable coherence times of transmon qubits ( from @xmath4s to nearly @xmath5s )  @xcite , theoretical proposals have already been set forth for simulating bose - hubbard - type models  @xcite , coupled - spin-  @xcite and spin - boson models  @xcite , topological states of matter  @xcite , and gauge fields  @xcite .",
    "along similar lines , in this paper we propose an sc - circuit emulation of a one - dimensional model featuring momentum - dependent e - ph couplings of ssh and bm types .",
    "this analog simulator entails sc transmon qubits and microwave resonators , the standard building blocks of circuit - qed systems  @xcite .",
    "the role of qubits in our system is to emulate spinless - fermion excitations , where the pseudospin-@xmath6 operators representing the qubits are mapped to fermionic ones through the jordan - wigner transformation . at the same time",
    ", the resonator modes ( microwave photons ) play the role of dispersionless ( einstein ) phonons .",
    "we show that the suggested setup allows realization of strong e - ph coupling regime , characterized by a small - polaron formation .",
    "furthermore , it enables the observation of a sharp transition from a nondegenerate single - particle ground state at zero quasimomentum to a twofold - degenerate one corresponding to a pair of equal and opposite ( nonzero ) quasimomenta . to demonstrate the feasibility of our simulation scheme , we show that  by applying appropriate pump pulses on the qubits  the relevant small - polaron states can be prepared within time scales several orders of magnitude shorter than the relevant qubit decoherence times .",
    "the proposed simulator is particularly suitable for a detailed characterization of small - polaron ground states ( or even excited states ) , by extracting their phonon content through direct counting of photons on the resonators .",
    "this unique tool , which is not at our disposal in traditional solid - state systems , also opens up the possibility to address experimentally the nonequilibrium aspects of polaron physics , i.e. , the complex problem of polaron - formation dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the question as to how rapidly upon creation ( injection ) of a single electron ( hole ) , i.e. , e - ph interaction quench , the cloud of correlated virtual phonons around it forms and results in a `` dressed '' polaronic quasiparticle is poorly understood at present .",
    "this dynamical process , which is expected to be particularly complex in systems with strongly momentum - dependent e - ph interactions , has quite recently attracted considerable attention  @xcite .",

    "the dotted curve coresponds to the phonon distribution for @xmath106 , i.e. , below the critical coupling strength.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    while phonon distributions peaked at zero phonons are characteristic of all small - polaron models in the weak - coupling regime ( e.g. , below the onset of the polaron crossover in the holstein model ) , the peculiarity of our findings is that here such distribution persists all the way up to the critical coupling strength . although the sharp transitions of the type found here do not result from any kind of cooperative behavior ( as is typical for quantum phase transitions in many - particle systems ) , the observed peculiar behavior allows us to treat @xmath161 as an effective `` order parameter '' for the predicted sharp transition .",
    "given that @xmath161 is a directly measurable quantity in our system , this fact will facilitate experimental verification of the existence of this transition .",
    "the feasibility of our simulation scheme is contingent upon the ability to prepare the desired small - polaron bloch states . for this purpose",
    ", we make use of the state - preparation protocol proposed in our previous work ( ref .  ) , which is only briefly explained in the following .",
    "we assume that the initial state of the system is the vacuum state @xmath178 .",
    "this state , with no excitations ( i.e. , with all qubits in their spin - down states ) and all resonators in their respective vacuum states , can be prepared via thermalization in a low - temperature environment",
    ". our target state is the dressed - excitation ( in the special case , small polaron ) bloch state @xmath179 , corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath118 of the total quasimomentum operator @xmath117 .",
    "the microwave driving required for preparing this state is envisioned to be of the form @xmath180 where @xmath181 describes its time dependence , and the phase factors @xmath182 indicate that spin - flip operations are applied to different qubits with a @xmath122-dependent phase difference .",
    "it is easy to show that the transition matrix element of the operator @xmath183 between the states @xmath184 and @xmath179 is given by  @xcite @xmath185 assuming that @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the energy difference between the states @xmath184 and @xmath179 , in the rwa the two states are rabi - coupled with the effective rabi frequency @xmath188 .",
    "thus , starting from the vacuum state @xmath184 , the state @xmath179 will be prepared within a time interval of duration  @xcite @xmath189 the form of the last expression is consistent with the expectation that the more strongly - dressed states ( smaller @xmath190 ) require longer preparation times .",
    "for the small - polaron ground states with @xmath191 these preparation times are much shorter than the decoherence time @xmath192 .",
    "for instance , assuming that the pumping amplitude is @xmath193mhz and taking the values for @xmath169 at the onset of the small - polaron regime [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : zgsnph](a ) ] , we respectively find that @xmath194ns for @xmath91mhz , and @xmath195ns for @xmath151mhz .",
    "the obtained state - preparation times are three orders of magnitude shorter than currently achievable decoherence times @xmath196s of transmon qubits  @xcite , this being a strong indication of the feasibility of our proposed protocol .",
    "the above rabi - coupling state - preparation protocol , which ensures energy and momentum conservation  @xcite , can in principle be adapted to other systems by taking into account their underlying symmetries .",
    "importantly , the ultimate sucess of this scheme in different systems will depend on the character of their underlying absorption spectra , as described by the corresponding spectral functions ( see sec .",
    "[ poldyn_subsec ] ) . as far as our system is concerned",
    ", it should be stressed that the absorption spectra of electronic systems coupled with optical phonons ( i.e. , phonon modes with a gap in their spectrum ) are characterized by generic spectral functions in which the `` coherent '' part ( with a finite spectral weight ) is energetically well separated from the incoherent background  @xcite .",
    "this form of absorption spectra should here allow one to avoid inadvertent population of other ( excited ) states while preparing a desired small - polaron ground state of the system .      here",
    "we discuss the method for measuring the average phonon number @xmath197 [ cf .",
    "eq .  ] , a quantity which can be thought of as an order parameter for the sharp small - polaron transition ( cf",
    "[ sharp_trans ] ) .",
    "as already stressed above , in our implementation @xmath197 corresponds to the average total photon number on the resonators .",
    "owing to the discrete translational symmetry of the system , the measurement of @xmath197 can be reduced to the measurement of the mean photon number of one of the resonators .",
    "this can be accomplished by adding an ancilla qubit which couples to this particular resonator  @xcite , but only during the measurement ; this qubit is assumed to be far - detuned from the resonator modes . by measuring the qubit state , the mean photon number on this resonator",
    "can be extracted , which multiplied with the total system size @xmath132 yields the result for @xmath197 .      as in every other quantum - computation device ,",
    "decoherence effects should also be present in our simulator .",
    "possible excitations in this system correspond either to flipping of the qubit states or to displacement of the resonator modes , which are subject to the decoherence of the qubits and resonators .",
    "in addition to very long dephasing times ( @xmath196s ) of transmon qubits achieved in recent years , for coplanar waveguide resonators the damping time of the microwave photons can reach the same order of magnitude as @xmath192 , with a quality factor larger than @xmath198 .",
    "the relevant energy scales in our simulator ( effective phonon frequency , e - ph coupling strength , and hopping energy ) are all of the order of @xmath199mhz , far exceeding the decoherence rates .",
    "besides , as shown in sec .",
    "[ stateprep ] , even for very strongly - dressed polaron states the typical duration of the state - preparation protocol is three orders of magnitude smaller than the decoherence times . finally , in the low - temperature environment of our system thermal excitations  which here have energies of a few ghz  can be safely neglected .",
    "the pump pulses of the kind described in sec .  [ stateprep ] may , in principle , induce unwanted transitions ( leakage ) to higher energy levels in a transmon qubit  @xcite .",
    "namely , in all qubits based on weakly - anharmonic oscillators leakage from the two - dimensional qubit hilbert space ( computational states ) is the leading source of errors at short pulse times  @xcite .",
    "this is especially pronounced if the pulse bandwidth is comparable to the anharmonicity .",
    "however , in a typical transmon with @xmath200 and a negative anharmonicity of @xmath201 , even pulses with durations of only a few ns are sufficiently frequency selective that the unwanted transitions can be neglected  @xcite . in our system",
    ", there is an off resonance of around @xmath202 mhz for such transitions .",
    "for a typical driving amplitude @xmath203mhz , the probability of leakage is below one percent , which is a reasonable error rate for the simulator .",
    "fabrication - related variations in the parameters of josephson junctions , which are @xmath204 at best and typically up to @xmath205 , are unavoidable even in modern - day sc circuits .",
    "this is , however , not expected to jeoperdize the observation of the predicted nonanalytic behavior in our system .",
    "namely , as is known from general polaron theory ( e.g. , the gerlach - lwen theorem ) the presence of such nonanalyticities ( or , more often , the absence thereof ) in a particular coupled e - ph model is intimately related to the type of the momentum dependence of the resulting coupling .",
    "this momentum dependence , in its own right , depends on the character of the particular coupling mechanisms involved ( recall discussions in the introduction and sec .",
    "[ mom_dependence ] ) , rather than on quantitative details such as the magnitude of the bare hopping integral ( which in our case is determined by @xmath206 ) .",
    "thus the occurrence of the real level crossing which gives rise to the sharp feature in the ground - state energy of the system should be quite robust ; the small variations in parameters such as @xmath206 can only lead to a slight shift of the critical coupling strength at which this crossing takes place . that this shift is expected to be small  for small variations @xmath207 of the josephson energy ( @xmath208 )  can be inferred from the expression for the effective coupling strength @xmath110 [ cf .",
    "because @xmath209 , where both @xmath82 and @xmath148 depend linearly on @xmath206 , we have that @xmath210 .",
    "generally speaking , dynamical response functions  fourier transforms of retarded two - time green s functions  provide a natural framework for characterizing excitations in many - body systems .",

    "the explicit forms of @xmath217 and @xmath218 are not relevant for our present purposes .",
    "in fact , the only relevant property of the hamiltonian @xmath217 is that its symmetries in the spinless - fermion ( pseudospin ) sector of the problem are the same as those of the hamiltonian @xmath111 , since this part of @xmath111 preserves its form in the interaction picture .",
    "it should be emphasized that , while the natural green s functions for spinless fermions are those that involve anticommutators [ cf .",
    "eq .  ] , in the single - particle problem at hand the commutator green s function @xmath219_{-}|\\textrm{g}_0\\rangle \\:.\\ ] ] contains the same physical information .",

    "the ramsey - interference protocol is in principle applicable in any system where single - site addressability is available and yields naturally the real - space and time - resolved commutator green s functions of spin operators  @xcite . in the problem at hand",
    "it involves the pseudospin degree of freedom of the transmon qubits .",
    "the general rabi pulses can be parameterized as @xmath229 where @xmath230 , with @xmath231 being the rabi frequency and @xmath232 the pulse duration ; @xmath233 is the phase of the laser field .",
    "the ramsey protocol makes use of the special case @xmath234 of such pulses , with @xmath235 and arbitrary @xmath233 .",
    "quite generally , the ramsey - interference protocol entails the following steps : ( 1 ) perform local @xmath158-rotation at site @xmath13 ( with @xmath236 ) ; ( 2 ) evolve the system during time @xmath237 ; ( 3 ) perform local @xmath158-rotation at site @xmath238 , or global @xmath158-rotation ( with @xmath239 ) ; ( 4 ) measure the system in the @xmath240 basis at site @xmath238 . in our system , the described protocol leads to the measurement result given by the expectation value @xmath241    the procedure for extracting relevant green s function can be simplified by exploiting the symmetries of our system in the pseudospin sector .",

    "we propose its use on pairs of qubits in a multi - qubit system , for the purpose of extracting the desired two - time correlation- and green s functions .",
    "provided that the single - particle retarded two - time green s function [ cf .",

    "[ gf_subsec ] and [ ramsey_subsec ] , we can also obtain the information about the spectral properties of the system .",
    "namely , by fourier - transforming this green s function to momentum - frequency space , the spectral function is obtained as @xmath258 .",
    "the spectral function can quite generally be represented in the form @xmath259 where @xmath260 is a complete set of total - quasimomentum @xmath121 eigenstates of the total hamiltonian of the coupled e - ph system ( in our case @xmath111 ) , and @xmath261 the corresponding eigenvalues . in the simplest case ,",

    "more generally , with increasing coupling strength there will be multiple coherent polaron bands below the one - phonon continuum ( threshold for inelastic scattering ) which sets in at energy @xmath265  @xcite , where @xmath266 is the relevant phonon frequency ( in our case @xmath72 ) .",
    "all these coherent ( split - off from the one - phonon continuum ) polaron states contribute to the above sum along with their respective continua .    the spectral function is intimately related to the dynamics of polaron formation",
    "let us assume that at @xmath267 a bare - excitation bloch state with quasimomentum @xmath121 is prepared and e - ph coupling is turned on ( e - ph interaction quench ) .",

    "polaron formation is admittedly a very complex dynamical process even in the case of the momentum - independent e - ph coupling  @xcite .",
    "even the very fundamental question related to the time it takes to form a polaron , as well as a more detailed understanding of how phonon excitations evolve into the correlated phonon cloud of the polaron quasiparticle , are not fully answered to date . in the presence of strongly - momentum dependent e - ph interactions , which even allow for the occurrence of sharp transitions , it should be even more difficult to arrive at a full understanding of this process . our system , with its unique set of experimental tools ,",
    "should be very useful in this regard . while the time it takes to form a polaron ( after an e - ph interaction quench )",
    "should be possible to extract already from measurements of the average phonon number ( by measuring the photon number on different resonators ) , additional characteristics of the polaron - formation dynamics can be unravelled by extracting the spectral function via a ramsey - interference protocol .",
    "to summarize , we have proposed a superconducting analog quantum simulator for a model with nonlocal electron - phonon couplings of su - schrieffer - heeger and breathing - mode types .",
    "the simulator is based on an array of transmon qubits and microwave resonators . in this system ,",
    "the nearest - neighbor qubits are josephson - coupled through an appropriately designed connecting circuit , the latter being also inductively coupled to a pair of adjacent resonators .",
    "our setup allows one to simulate the strong excitation - phonon coupling regime , characterized by the small - polaron formation , with quite realistic values of the circuit parameters .",
    "the most interesting feature of the investigated model is the occurrence of a sharp ( first - order ) transition at a critical coupling strength .",
    "this transition results from a real level crossing and physically corresponds to the change from a nondegenerate single - particle ground state at zero quasimomentum ( @xmath0 ) to a twofold - degenerate one at nonzero quasimomenta @xmath1 and @xmath2 . aside from the fact that our suggested setup provides a tunable experimentally platform for observing the sharp transition ,",
    "what further motivated the present work is the circumstance that e - ph coupling in real materials is insufficiently strong for observing any measurable consequence of this type of transition  @xcite .",
    "one of the obvious advantages of superconducting josephson - junction based systems compared to other quantum - simulation platforms ( trapped ions , polar molecules , rydberg atoms ) is that they allow realization of strictly nearest - neighbor hopping  @xcite , thus making it possible to simulate relevant polaron models in a quite realistic fashion . in trapped - ion and polar - molecule systems , for instance , the presence of non - nearest neighbor hopping is unavoidable , originating from the presence of long - range interactions between their elementary constituents ( coulomb interaction between ions and dipolar interaction between polar molecules ) ; these systems show similar limitations when it comes to mimicking the behavior of dispersionless ( zero - dimensional ) phonons  @xcite .",
    "in addition to these intrinsic advantages of superconducting systems compared to other available experimental platforms , a unique aspect of our suggested setup is the capability of the _ in - situ _ altering of the hopping energy through an externally - tunable magnetic flux .",
    "once experimentally realized , our suggested setup could also be used for studying the nonequilibrium aspects of polaron physics , i.e. , the dynamics of small - polaron formation .",
