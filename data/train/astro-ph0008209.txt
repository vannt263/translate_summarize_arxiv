    "in recent years , many measurements of the primary spectrum and chemical composition of cosmic rays have been carried out .",
    "some of them are performed directly by balloon - borne experiments up to about 100 tev .",
    "others are by indirect ground - based experiments ranging from sub - tev to some 100 eev .",
    "these experiments have mainly been done to study the knee region .",
    "recent reports indicate that the all - particle spectrum of cosmic rays does not present a sudden steepening , but rather a gradual bent near the energy at the knee , @xmath2 ev , from @xmath3 to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this value of @xmath5 is smaller than about a factor of 2 compared to those of earlier reports @xcite .",
    "the chemical composition of cosmic rays below @xmath5 is directly measured and is almost constant in terms of the average logarithmic mass , @xmath6 . however , the data of @xmath6 above @xmath5 fairly scatter , because they are obtained by indirect air shower observations . it is also noted that the value of @xmath6 varies depending on the hadronic interaction models assumed in simulations of extensive air showers @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is generally believed that cosmic rays in the energy range up to @xmath5 are accelerated mostly by a supernova remnant ( snr ) shock although there still exist some arguments that the origin of galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) is not yet settled @xcite .",
    "when particles cross the shock front back and forth frequently , they obtain high energies proportional to the shock velocity , which is called the first order fermi acceleration ( for review , see @xcite ) .",
    "this stochastic acceleration and deformation of source spectra due to energy - dependent diffusion from the galaxy can explain the power - law spectrum up to the knee .",
    "this scenario predicts that the maximum energy @xmath7 , that particles can achieve by the shock acceleration mechanism , nearly equals @xmath5 .",
    "actually @xmath7 is estimated to be @xmath8 ev @xcite at most , where @xmath9 is the atomic number , which is nearly two orders lower than @xmath5 . however",
    ", this value is achieved by parallel shock acceleration where the normal of the shock front is parallel to the direction of the interstellar magnetic field .",
    "this is different from nonparallel shocks , where the angle @xmath10 between the shock normal and the field direction is not zero .",
    "these oblique shocks can accelerate particles much more efficiently @xcite .",
    "for extremely oblique ( quasiperpendicular ) shocks , the values of @xmath7 are increased by several orders of magnitude compared to those in parallel collisions .",
    "the details will be described in the next section .    in this paper",
    "we will explain the knee behavior of the energy spectrum with the acceleration mechanism as caused by oblique shocks .",
    "our model is based on a simple idea as follows @xcite .",
    "the ejected materials from a supernova explosion expand into the interstellar medium ( ism ) driving a shock wave .",
    "while the expanding shell sweep up its own mass of the ism , the shock acceleration may be active . the ejected mass ( @xmath11 @xmath12 ) with large momentum moves out freely at constant velocity @xmath13",
    "cm / s during the free expansion phase .",
    "the shape of the shock front is supposed to be almost spherically symmetric .",
    "the directions of the interstellar magnetic field lines will be , over a wide range , nearly random rather than well aligned .",
    "it is therefore assumed that the field lines meet the shock front at random angles @xmath10 , the cosines of which , @xmath14 , are uniformly distributed .",
    "a more detailed discussion will be presented in section iii .",
    "since @xmath7 is strongly dependent upon @xmath14 , @xmath7 values extend from @xmath15 in parallel shocks to @xmath16 in quasiperpendicular ones .",
    "the uniform distribution of @xmath14 permits that particles with @xmath17 , have less chances to reach high energies than those with @xmath18",
    ".    there is an important question in acceleration at oblique shocks @xcite , however , namely that the rate of accelerated particles ( injection efficiency ) decreases drastically as the shock obliquity increases . on the other hand ,",
    "the obliquity produces a harder energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "since particles with @xmath19 can be considered to be accelerated at shocks with the whole range of @xmath14 , we do not apply modifications to the given spectra . for @xmath20 , both corrections of the injection efficiency and",
    "the change of the spectral index are taken into consideration , in addition to the chance probability of having @xmath14 .",
    "their fluxes decrease and cause a gradual change of spectral indices . in terms of rigidity ,",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 , corresponding to @xmath23 and @xmath24 , are the same irrespective of @xmath9 .",
    "the flux of each elemental group starts to bend at different @xmath23 .",
    "then the total flux shows a slow change around the knee .",
    "we first choose the spectral indices and absolute fluxes for six nuclear groups at 1 tev as an assumption so as to fit balloon - borne data .",
    "next , based on our model , we calculate the energy spectrum up to @xmath25 tev for each group and obtain therefrom the total spectrum and energy dependence of the chemical composition directly .",
    "these results are compared with recent data of balloon and air shower experiments .",
    "in this section we estimate the maximum energy of particles accelerated by oblique shocks at supernova remnants .",
    "if magnetic field lines are not parallel to the shock normal , an electric field is induced in the rest frame of the shock .",
    "particles drift along the shock front gaining energies due to this field . in order to describe the interactions of particles with shocks concisely ,",
    "the de hoffmann - teller frame in which the electric field vanishes globally is widely used @xcite . for oblique shocks ,",
    "reflection at the shock front is more important than diffusion in the downstream region ( kirk & heavens 1989 @xcite ) , so that a more rapid acceleration can occur than for parallel shocks .",
    "the maximum energies of accelerated particles can be even a few orders of magnitude larger in the case of a quasiperpendicular shock compared to parallel ones .",
    "suppose a plane shock wave propagating at a non - relativistic speed @xmath26 with respect to the upstream medium .",
    "the shock normal intersects with the upstream magnetic field @xmath27 at an angle @xmath10",
    ". a schematic view of the shock in the upstream rest frame is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : frame ] . parameters for the downstream region in its own rest frame , with magnetic field inclination @xmath28 and shock velocity @xmath29 , can be expressed in terms of the upstream ones @xcite .",
    "we assume that the amplitude of the magnetic field perturbations is sufficiently small in the following calculation .",
    "there are some energy loss processes significant for the limitation of particle acceleration .",
    "for example , ionization , bremsstrahlung , and synchrotron radiation are conceivable . these processes for protons or other nuclei , however , are not so important within the energy range in which we are interested . the time scale of acceleration by oblique shocks at snrs is regarded as sufficiently small compared to those of such loss processes .",
    "unless the energy losses of particles are significant , the finite lifetime of the supernova blast wave as a strong shock mainly limits the maximum energy per particle .",
    "effective shock acceleration can occur until the swept up mass reaches the ejected mass @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "the lifetime of the shock @xmath30 is estimated to be about thousand years for ejecta expanding at velocity @xmath31 cm / s into a medium of average density 1 proton@xmath32 .",
    "as long as the characteristic length for diffusion is much less than the radius of the shock , the plane approximation is valid . balancing the acceleration time scale with @xmath30 after lagage & cesarsky @xcite , we can write down the following expression for @xmath7 , @xmath33^ { -1 } , \\label{eqn : emax1}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the compression ratio of the shock , i.e. @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the square root of the ratio of @xmath37 to @xmath38 , where the two @xmath39 s are the parallel and normal components of the diffusion coefficient with respect to the magnetic field lines .    substituting the various constants with plausible values , we obtain @xmath7 as a function of @xmath40 and @xmath36 , @xmath41 \\left(\\frac{b_{1}}{30{\\rm \\mu g } } \\right)\\left(\\frac{r_{{\\rm sh}}}{3{\\rm pc}}\\right ) \\left(\\frac{u_{1}}{10^{7}{\\rm m / s}}\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{z}{x}\\frac{r-1}{r}\\left\\{\\eta^{2}+\\frac{1-\\eta^{2}}{x^{2 } } + \\frac{r[\\eta^{2}+\\frac{r^{2}}{x^{2}}(1-\\eta^{2 } ) ] } { [ \\eta^{2}+r^{2}(1-\\eta^{2})]^{\\frac{3}{2}}}\\right\\}^{-1}. \\label{eqn : emax2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the maximum energy for parallel shocks ( @xmath42 )",

    "namely , due to non - linear effects , the maximum energies are enhanced by the factor of @xmath49 compared to ordinary values @xcite .",
    "we will comment on the rather large value of @xmath27 @xcite in the next subsection .",
    "it is noted that the value @xmath50 in eq .",

    "( [ eqn : rigidity ] ) .",
    "as we have mentioned above , we take a @xmath27-value somewhat larger than the average strength of the interstellar magnetic field of magnitude of microgauss .",
    "it is widely known that snrs are usually accompanied with magnetic fields .",
    "the sufficiently strong field is possibly present in the accelerated region around snr - shocks because of rapid expansion of ejecta into the interstellar medium .",
    "there is some possibility @xcite that cosmic ray streams amplify non - linearly magnetic fields up to 1 mg .",
    "recent measurement also suggest that some galactic snrs possess intense magnetic fields of the order from milligauss to sub - milligauss in the downstream region @xcite .",
    "these observed values are suppressed by a factor of 5 or so in the upstream , and hence our choice @xmath63 @xmath64 g is quite relevant .",
    "there are some investigations related to the magnetic field geometry in snrs . in young remnants ,",
    "the ambient field lines are stretched and amplified to be predominantly parallel to the shock normal on account of rayleigh - taylor instabilities @xcite . on the other hand , for older snrs perpendicular shocks",
    "likely originate from the compression of the ambient interstellar field .",
    "observations of synchrotron radiation also support this morphology @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath65 of our choice and isotropic distribution of @xmath14 may be appropriate as far as we are concerned with the whole behavior of cosmic rays .",

    "based on the result that the angular dependence of the maximum energy is quite significant , we propose a simple model .",
    "the following three issues are examined : ( 1 ) the chance probability of @xmath14 occurrence , ( 2 ) the dependence of the injection efficiency on @xmath14 and ( 3 ) the @xmath14 dependence of the spectral index .",
    "the overall morphology of snr - shocks is considered to be almost spherically symmetric even if the shape of each is somewhat distorted .",
    "the ambient disordered magnetic field lines over a wide range intersect the shock normal at various angles . moreover , as we described in the section ii .",
    "b , there exist snrs with various ages whose magnetic fields cross the shock fronts with a wide variety of angles .",
    "since both young and old snrs are considered as sources of energetic cosmic rays , averaging over the various ages of snrs and different shapes of their shock fronts , we assume a uniform distribution of @xmath14 in our model .",
    "the value of @xmath14 is restricted within the range between @xmath77 and 1 to satisfy the condition that the shock front should not move at the light velocity or above in the h - t frame .",
    "the probability in the width @xmath78 is then @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the normalization factor .",

    "let @xmath84 be the energy of a particle with @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath86 are the maximum energies in parallel ( @xmath87 ) and extremely oblique ( quasiperpendicular : @xmath88 ) shocks , respectively .",
    "a particular value of @xmath14 corresponds to an unique @xmath84 since @xmath57 is a monotonic decreasing function of @xmath14 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : emax ] . only oblique shocks in the range from the @xmath14 to @xmath77",
    "can then serve to give @xmath84 .",
    "the fluxes at @xmath84 should therefore be reduced by the factor @xmath89 .",
    "baring , ellison and jones @xcite developed test particle monte - carlo simulations with large angle scattering processes ( abbreviated as la ) .",
    "they showed that the efficiency for injecting thermal particles into an acceleration mechanism strongly depends on obliquity and varies inversely with @xmath90 ( @xmath91 in their notation ) , in the case of high mach numbers .",
    "they also checked the @xmath68 ( @xmath92 our @xmath36 ) dependence of the injection efficiency , @xmath93 . when their results are applied to the present case @xmath94 , the injection efficiency relative to @xmath95 is nearly equal to or less than 0.01 at @xmath96 .",
    "namely oblique shocks with @xmath14 from @xmath97 to 0.6 contribute very little to the acceleration of particles .    naito and",
    "takahara @xcite also attempted test particle simulations in oblique shocks . instead of directly presenting @xmath93",
    ", they showed the pitch angle ( @xmath55 ) distribution in both cases of la and pitch - angle scattering ( abbreviated as pa ) in their figures 3 and 4 @xcite , respectively , for @xmath98 . using the number of injected particles for these @xmath14 values",
    ", we can estimate @xmath93 by integrating with respect to @xmath55 from @xmath99 to 1 in the downstream , where the @xmath55 distribution of their simulation agrees well with the expected one @xcite .",
    "the relative injection efficiency @xmath93 changes little even if the number of accelerated particles in the upstream are added , because the numbers are less than those in the downstream and also the ratios to @xmath100 are similar to those in the upstream .    for la , @xmath101 , whereas for pa @xmath102 are evaluated corresponding to @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "it is argued @xcite that la is adequate for @xmath104 , while pa is acceptable for @xmath105 . in our case , @xmath106 is somehow between la and pa , and @xmath93 is similar in both cases .",
    "therefore , we may simply take , @xmath107    the detailed reason why the above two works present very different results on @xmath93 , is not clear .",
    "the input for simulations , however , differs for the two approaches . in ellison",
    "@xcite , injected particles are thermal , the energies of accelerated particles are up to about 10 mev , and @xmath108 is slow , say @xmath109 m / s .",
    "ellison has also presented the application to the real snr @xcite .",
    "he considered somewhat older objects which are in sedov phase . on the other hand , in naito and takahara @xcite ,",
    "the lorentz factors of injected particles are fixed at 2 , the factors of accelerated particles are followed up to @xmath110 , and the shock is relativistic : @xmath111 . in the light of the present treatments or parameters , such as @xmath112 and",
    "considering that the energies concerned are higher than 1 tev , we assume eq .",
    "( [ eqn : inject ] ) here .      in this subsection",
    ", we consider the dependence of the spectral index on obliquity .",
    "it has been frequently pointed out that one of the advantages of the first order fermi acceleration mechanism is that it gives a power - law energy spectrum .",
    "namely one gets for the differential spectrum @xmath113 , if we take terms of fluid velocities up to first order into account , @xmath114 for a strong shock ( @xmath115 ) , the differential spectral index is @xmath116 .",
    "this index is expected to be modified into the final index @xmath117 which is observed .",
    "@xmath117 is somewhat steeper than @xmath118 by considering the energy - dependent leakage from the galaxy @xcite .",
    "we do not go into detailed discussions of this change in this paper , even though different modifications are used for different nuclear groups in the next subsection .",
    "this dependence of @xmath118 values on @xmath14 is examined .",
    "this dependence is assumed to apply to @xmath117 in the same form .",
    "although nonlinear back reaction effects of accelerated particles reduce @xmath118 values by about 0.5 at higher energies even in parallel shocks @xcite , only the index dependence on @xmath14 is considered here .",
    "the dependence has been studied in earlier works @xcite . here",
    ", we again refer to naito and takahara @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite they showed that @xmath118 is practically 2 at @xmath95 , and diminishes as @xmath14 decreases except for @xmath119 being rather independent for the three cases @xmath120 .",
    "it is also shown @xcite , for @xmath121 in the case of la , @xmath118 is 2.08 , slightly larger than 2 , at @xmath95 , and almost linearly decreases as @xmath14 decreases .",
    "then @xmath118 reaches a minimum of 1.5 at @xmath122 . for @xmath123",
    ", @xmath118 starts to increase rapidly . while for the pa case , @xmath118 is nearly equal to 2.1 at @xmath42 .",
    "as @xmath14 decreases , @xmath118 decreases monotonically and reaches 1.0 as @xmath14 approaches @xmath97 . in both cases",
    "the energy spectra become harder as shocks are more oblique .",
    "we choose the la model except for @xmath124 and assume simply that @xmath118 is proportional to @xmath14 such as , @xmath125 where @xmath126 = 0.68 , @xmath127 = 1.41 and @xmath128 .",
    "this dependence of power indices on obliquity enhances intensities of accelerated particles by oblique shocks .",
    "the present choice leads to an underestimate of this enhancement . for the energies of particles",
    "@xmath84 less than @xmath61 , the enhancement factor should be unity , because of @xmath118 levelling off by summing up over the whole region of @xmath14 , i.e. from 1 to @xmath97 .    for @xmath129 , there is a one - to - one correspondence of @xmath14 to @xmath84 as mentioned above . taking into account the injection efficiency given by eq .",

    "[ fig : spvar ] ) and hegra choices of parameters , are compared with experimental data .",
    "as seen in this figure , ours curve fits well tibet @xcite and akeno data @xcite up to several times @xmath170 gev , while the curve with hegra parameters is in good agreement with dice @xcite and casa - mia @xcite , in which both @xmath150 and @xmath153 are about 30@xmath171 lower than the akeno data .",
    "the kascade experiment presented a preliminary result with a four component assumption ( h , he , c , and fe ) @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the position of the knee depends on rigidity .",
    "that is also one of our conclusions .",
    "anyway , the total flux can be explained at least up to @xmath170 gev by the present model . above that energy",
    ", the solid curve falls below the akeno data .",
    "other sources than snrs in galaxy may be needed .",
    "we express the two curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : sptot ] in single power laws below and above @xmath5 by using the least square method . for hegra and ours choices @xmath172 and @xmath173 , respectively , between @xmath174 gev and @xmath175 gev ; and @xmath176 and @xmath177 , respectively , between @xmath178 and @xmath179 gev are obtained .",
    "these values depend on the adopted energy range ; but they can be compared with experimental data . for example , tibet @xmath117 @xcite gives @xmath180 below and @xmath181 above @xmath5 and casa - blanca @xcite @xmath182 and @xmath183 .      using the results of energy fluxes , we examine how the chemical composition of cosmic ray particles changes with energy . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate ] the flux ratio of p plus he to all particles is plotted against the energy per particle .",
    "theoretical curves suggest a change with increasing energies from mixed composition to heavy particle dominance . the curve with hegra parameters lies almost within the uncertainties of experiments quoted here .",
    "the relative abundance of light elements , however , tends to increase again beyond the energy of several times @xmath25 gev from experiments of dice and hegra",
    ".    as a commonly used indicator of the composition , we take the average value of the logarithm of the mass number @xmath184 , as @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the flux of species @xmath187 which denotes each elemental group as shown in table [ tbl : condition ] .",
    "our two curves of @xmath6 versus energy @xmath150 are shown and compared with various data in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] .",
    "both curves monotonically increase with energy , which is naturally confirmed by the present model .",
    "the hegra parametrization gives lower values than ours in the whole energy range .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate ] experimental data scatter and have large uncertainties especially near and above the knee .",
    "a similar trend is seen in fig . [",
    "fig : comp ] .",
    "this is due to the fact that ground - based measurements can study the composition only indirectly .",
    "the values of @xmath6 significantly depends on the experimental observables to be treated and on the hadronic interaction models to be used in simulation processes .",
    "fairly different @xmath6 values are reported by various groups .",
    "some authors @xcite say that @xmath6 decreases in energy regions higher than the knee .",
    "other authors @xcite show that @xmath6 has even a dip near @xmath5 .",
    "most of the other data indicate that @xmath6 increases with @xmath150 .",
    "preliminary results of the kascade experiment @xcite show a sharp increase in logarithmic mass above several times of @xmath25 gev . on the other hand ,",
    "the data extracted from equi - intensity curves depicted by chacaltaya ii @xcite are somewhat closer to ours . in the present stage",
    "we can not reach a definite conclusion about whether our curves are in good agreement with data or not .",
    "we consider the acceleration caused by oblique shocks in which outer magnetic field lines cross the shock normal at any angle @xmath10 . we calculate @xmath7 as a function of @xmath188 , where @xmath7 is the maximum energy that particles can achieve ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : emax2 ] ) ) .",
    "it is shown that @xmath7 with extreme obliquity is more than 1400 times compared to that with parallel shocks ( @xmath42 ) . in the present model , @xmath14 is distributed uniformly and the @xmath14 dependence of the injection efficiency and the change of spectral indices are taken in to account .",
    "we choose the two parameter sets of power indices and absolute fluxes at @xmath0 ev for various elemental groups shown in table [ tbl : condition ] .",
    "then the spectra and compositions of cosmic rays are calculated up to much higher energies , say @xmath189 ev .",
    "it is shown that @xmath190 ev , where spectral curves start to bend over and continue up to @xmath191 .",
    "these results fit the proton spectrum well and explain a smooth knee behavior around @xmath192 ev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spphe ] ) .    as to the total flux , both curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : sptot ] exhibit a smooth knee behavior .",
    "the `` hegra '' choice fits well dice and casa - mia data , while `` ours '' choice reproduces well tibet and akeno data up to several times @xmath1 ev .",
    "however , since our model is limited by @xmath7 , for energies higher than @xmath189 ev , more energetic sources of cosmic rays should be necessary .",
    "favorite candidates for the sources of cosmic rays far above the knee may be microquasers , pulsars , active galactic nuclei @xcite , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite or other hitherto unknown sources .",
    "as for the composition , our value of @xmath6 increases with the energy per particle as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] . data from various experiments scatter and have large uncertainties , particularly above @xmath5 .",
    "thus the situation remains uncertain .",
    "recent results by fly s eye , haverah park , and hires groups provide some interesting data of composition in the high energy region above @xmath170 gev as summarized in ref .",
    "data of haverah park and hires show that light components are abundant towards @xmath193 gev , while a relatively heavy composition is suggested by fly s eye .",
    "these may also suggest some other origins apart from snrs .    in the present paper , we fixed @xmath36 , @xmath27 , @xmath46 , @xmath34 and @xmath26 ( i. e. @xmath77 ) in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : emax2 ] ) to evaluate the dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath14 quantitatively and to obtain numerical values which could be directly compared with data . generally , there are various shocks at snrs where these quantities differ considerably depending on their ages , sizes and so on",
    ". however , as far as we are concerned with the whole or averaged behavior of cosmic rays which are observed , our choices and fixing of these quantities seem to be appropriate .",
    "we neglect the extremely quasi - perpendicular case in which the de - hoffmann - teller frame can not be used .",
