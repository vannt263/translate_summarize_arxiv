    "since it is hard to synthesize this loosely bound isotope in significant quantities in any astrophysical environment ( epstein , arnett & schramm 1976 ; epstein 1977 ; prodanovi & fields 2003 ) , its abundance in galaxies is expected to monotonically decrease with time owing to stellar cycling .",
    "deuterium is the light nuclide produced during big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) whose primordial abundance is most tightly tied to the baryon - to - photon ratio , @xmath3 ( or , equivalently , to the ratio of the baryon and critical densities at the present time , @xmath4 ) . in principle , once its primordial abundance , ( d / h)@xmath5 , is derived from measurements in unevolved systems , the value of @xmath4 is precisely known . however , there is still significant dispersion among the abundances derived for a handful of high - redshift , low - metallicity absorption - line systems towards quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) with reasonably firm deuterium detections .",
    "a more precise @xmath3 determination comes from the observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) power spectrum coupled to ly@xmath6 forest data ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ; see , however , pettini 2006 , his fig .  7 )",

    "2004 ) .",
    "relating ( d / h)@xmath5 to the current local abundance of d meets with the non - trivial issue of estimating what the _ true _ local abundance of deuterium actually is .",

    "in particular , the higher the mass of massive stars ( responsible for a quick recycling of the gas ) and the lower the mass of very - low mass objects ( which just lock - up material , from the point of view of gce ) , the lower ( higher ) the d / h ( o / h ) ratio predicted at present . the fraction of stars with initial mass @xmath12 8  m@xmath13 ( @xmath14 1  m@xmath13 ) is larger ( smaller ) for the kroupa et al .",

    "all the ratios are normalized to the solar oxygen and silicon abundances from asplund et al .",
    "an apparently striking feature of all the models is that only minor deuterium destruction is predicted as [ o / h ] varies on more than two orders of magnitude , increasing from [ o / h ] @xmath193 dex up to [ o / h ] @xmath18 @xmath200.5 dex .",
    "the deuterium abundance is sensibly reduced afterwards .",
    "this behaviour is easily explained by the large oxygen yield from the first type ii supernovae , which leads to a prompt oxygen enrichment of the ism only a few million years after the onset of the star formation .",
    "indeed , we find [ o / h ]  @xmath213.0 dex already 4 million years after the onset of the star formation in the galaxy , which raises to [ o / h ]  = @xmath200.5 dex in the following @xmath18300 million years . in the meantime , continuing infall of gas of primordial chemical composition helps to keep the d abundance near its primordial value ",
    "infall of gas is particularly strong during the early galaxy evolution , so that the consumed d is being replenished fast by infall at those earlier times .",
    "later on , when the contribution from low- and intermediate - mass stars ( which are not net oxygen producers ) to the chemical evolution of the galaxy becomes increasingly important and the infall rate is reduced , a steeper behaviour on the d / h versus o / h plot is observed .    in table",

    "none of our models is able to predict astration factors larger than @xmath23 2 .",

    "deuterium astration in galaxies is expected to be strongly dependent on the assumptions for the two competing processes of star formation and gas infall . in fig .",

    "the two models assume different prescriptions for the star formation and infall rates , yet the predicted deuterium evolution is almost the same .",
    "this is because what really matters is _ the interplay _ between subtraction and replenishment of gas at each time , and this interconnection is severely constrained by a number of independent observables ( see , e.g. , matteucci 2004 ) . according to fig .",
    "[ fig.com ] , only a mild deuterium destruction is predicted in the last 4.5 gyr .",
    "this is consistent with the mild galactic evolution at late times suggested by the small increase of the overall metallicity of the gas from the time of sun formation up to now ( esteban et al .",
    "2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "also the observed g- and k - dwarf metallicity distributions clearly show that the majority of the stars in the solar neighbourhood formed at low metallicities , [ fe / h ] @xmath24 0 , thus pointing again to a low star formation activity ( and , hence , less evolution ) at late times .",

    "it is worth emphasizing that with these prescriptions the model also well reproduces all the other observational constraints ( romano et al .",

    "in general , our models predict ( d / h)@xmath16 values in the range 1.42.0 @xmath10 10@xmath11 .",
    "we need to enhance the ratio of the star formation to gas infall efficiencies if a larger fraction of the initial deuterium has to be destroyed .",
    "but can a more efficient star formation and/or less effective infall of unprocessed gas be accommodated within successful gce models ?",
    "it is immediately seen that the almost constant metal abundance of the ism from the time of sun s formation up to now ( esteban et al .",
    "2004 ) sharply contrasts with rapid star formation and/or absence of external sources of unenriched gas . in fig .",
    "[ fig.bad ] , we show the outputs of a model especially designed to produce a significant drop in deuterium abundance from its psc value to the local one ( for further modeling and discussions see tosi et al .",
    "this model , assuming @xmath25 = 1.5 gyr rather than 7 gyr for the thin - disc formation time scale , fits the solar and local ` low ' d / h values ( fig .",
    "[ fig.bad ] , upper panel , solid line ) , as well as other observational constraints ( such as for instance the current gaseous and stellar mass surface densities at the solar position ) .",
    "however , it is barely consistent with the metal abundances of the sun , it predits a sharp increase of the metal abundance of the ism in the last 4.5  gyr ( at variance with the observations ) , and it can not account for the metallicity distribution of solar neighbourhood g- and k - dwarf stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig.bad ] , lower panel , solid line ) .",

    "k dwarfs have lifetimes older than the present age of the galactic disc , and are thus ideal stars for investigating the chemical evolution of the disc .",
    "g dwarf stars instead are sufficiently massive that some of them have begun to evolve away from the main sequence , so that corrections must be taken into account when determining their space densities and metallicity ( kotoneva et al . 2002 ) .",
    "these corrections are at least partly responsible for the non - negligible differences among different observational g - dwarf metallicity distributions ( in particular , the low - metallicity tail of the distribution and the exact position of the peak may vary significantly according to different authors ) . in conclusion ,",

    ", it seems that gce models explain the lowest d / o value better than the highest one , while the opposite is true for d / h ( upper panel ) .",
    "however , one should recall that the current oxygen abundance displays a non - negligible spread . indeed , several indicators  hii regions , b - type stars , the neutral medium  show that the local oxygen abundance varies in the range 8.3  @xmath24 log(o / h)+12  @xmath24 9.0 ( fig .",

    "it is seen that the shape of the gradients slightly changes when changing the prescriptions about the imf and the stellar lifetimes . in the galactocentric distance range @xmath30 = 412 kpc the theoretical gradients of log(d / h ) , log(d / o ) , and log(o / h)+12 are 0.03  @xmath17  0.01 dex  kpc@xmath31 , 0.08 dex  kpc@xmath31 , and @xmath200.055  @xmath17  0.005 dex  kpc@xmath31 , respectively . in the outermost regions of the disc the gradient of d / h flattens , while those of d / o and o / h steepen , owing to the lower and lower amount of gas processed by stars",
    "outward in the disc .    before concluding that , according to gce model predictions , one shall observe d / h ratios close to the primordial value at the largest radii in spiral galaxies , it is worth reminding that the model predictions depend on a number of uncertain free parameters . model a of chiappini et al .",
    "( 2001 ) produces a fairly steep o / h gradient at the largest radii ( fig .",
    "[ fig.grad ] , bottom panel ) , while the majority of the data suggest a flatter behaviour .",
    "a flatter o / h gradient in the outer disc is easily obtained by suppressing the gas density threshold which regulates the star formation process during the preceding halo phase .",

    "this model tends to predict higher oxygen abundances , hence lower d / o ratios , across the disc .",
    "we conclude that , in principle , accurate measurements of both d / h and o / h in the outermost regions of spiral galaxies can allow us to discriminate among existing scenarios of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "in fact , only minor uncertainties related to the adopted stellar yields affect the interpretation of the data in this case , owing to the well - known nucleosynthetic origin of both species .",
    "hence , observational efforts in this direction are highly desirable .    in summary ,",
    "notice that all the gce models discussed above favour minor deuterium variations [ @xmath34log(d / h)/@xmath35 0.02 dex kpc@xmath31 ] in the galactocentric distance range sampled by current observations ( @xmath37 811 kpc ) , hence favouring the highest ( d / h)@xmath38 determinations as representative of the local deuterium abundance .",
    "in general , observations of deuterium abundances provide _ lower bounds _ on its primordial abundance",
    ". however , at sufficiently high redshifts and low metallicities , one expects the primordial abundance of deuterium to reveal itself as a plateau . instead",
    ", statistically significant scatter of the d / h measurements has been found in several high - redshift qso absorbers . before claiming that a dispersion around the mean value is actually present , one has to carefully check possible systematics affecting the abundance derivation .",
    "it has been suggested that in the absorbers with the lowest hi column densities , interlopers might indeed contribute to the inferred di column densities , while in those with the highest hi column densities , interlopers might affect the wings of the hi lines ( steigman 2004 , 2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "yet , it is worth noticing that the placement of the continuum and the fitting of the damping wings are closely related for dlas : if one gets the continuum wrong , it is unlikely that he could fit the line profile satisfactorily ( m. pettini , private communication ) . in this paper , we assume ( d / h)@xmath15  = ( 2.6  @xmath17  0.3 )  @xmath10  10@xmath11 , i.e. the weighted mean of d / h measurements towards qsos ( indirect determinations give a consistent value ; see discussions in sections  [ sec.int ] and [ sec.dat ] )",
    ".    of more concern is the dispersion of local d / h data . in the lism , d / h is found to vary from @xmath18  0.5@xmath10  10@xmath11 to @xmath18  2.2@xmath10  10@xmath11 ( hbrad et al .",

    ". basically , two mechanisms are suggested in the current literature which might explain the observed variation ( pettini 2006 , and references therein ; see also lemoine et al .",

    ", one should recover the true local d / h in interstellar clouds which have been accelerated by supernova shocks , since the depletion of refractory elements is much reduced relative to that of the normal quiescent ism there ; in this case , the true local abundance of deuterium would be the highest observed one ( linsky et al .",
    "2005 , and references therein ) . in the second case",
    ", the true local abundance of deuterium would be the lowest observed one . in any case ,",
    "the mean d / h value measured within the local bubble should not be considered any more as representative of the actual degree of astration suffered by deuterium in the solar neighbourhood . by assuming that the primordial abundance of deuterium is reasonably well known",
    ", one can usefully bind the deuterium astration factor of the solar vicinity .",
    "an astration factor ( by number ) either as low as @xmath39 or a factor of 23 higher is permitted by the observations .    in this paper ,",
    "we have computed a number of gce models for the solar vicinity as well as for the whole galactic disc and conclude that :    1 .   only low astration factors ( not in excess of @xmath40 ) are compatible with gce requirements : our models predict ( d / h)@xmath16  = 1.42.0  @xmath10  10@xmath11 starting from a primordial value of ( d / h)@xmath15  = 2.6  @xmath10  10@xmath11 .",
    "this is not surprising : in the absence of supernova - driven winds which efficiently remove the metal - rich ejecta of dying stars from the galaxy and/or in the absence of a peculiar imf , the relatively high present - day gas content and low metallicity are indicative of modest astration ( and , hence , modest d destruction ; see also tosi et al .",

    "<S> estimates of the interstellar deuterium abundance span a wide range of values . until recently , it was customary to adopt the abundance of deuterium measured in the local bubble as representative of the local one . </S>",
    "<S> now , it is becoming unclear whether the true local deuterium abundance is significantly higher or lower than this value , depending on the interpretation given to current data . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to deal with the issue of the deuterium variation and see whether it challenges our current understanding of the galaxy evolution . to this aim </S>",
    "<S> , we study the evolution of deuterium in the framework of successful models for the chemical evolution of the milky way able to reproduce the majority of the observational constraints for the solar neighbourhood and for the galactic disc . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in the framework of our models , the lowest d / h values observed locally can not be explained in terms of simple astration processes occurring during the galaxy evolution . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the combination of a mild star formation and a continuous infall of unprocessed gas required to fit all the available observational data allows only a modest variation of the deuterium abundance from its primordial value . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we suggest that depletion of deuterium on to dust grains is the most likely physical mechanism proposed so far to explain the observed dispersion in the local data .    </S>",
