    "a polar ( or type object ; cropper 1990 ) is an accreting binary composed of a mass - donating low mass secondary star and a magnetized white dwarf with a field strength of the order of 10 - 100 mg .",
    "matter from the secondary accretes along the field lines onto a small region of the white dwarf close to the magnetic pole .",
    "since the flow is highly supersonic , a standing shock is formed close to the white dwarf , and a hot plasma with a temperature of @xmath4  k is formed . from the postshock plasma , optical cyclotron emission and optically thin thermal plasma emission in x - rays have been observed .",
    "in addition to this , blackbody emission with a temperature of 1040  ev is observed .",
    "although the blackbody component is considered to be radiated from the surface of the white dwarf around the postshock plasma via reprocessing of the cyclotron and the hard x - ray radiation , its intensity is usually much larger than that of the cyclotron and hard x - ray radiation .",
    "this has become known as the so - called ` soft excess problem ' ( rothschild  1981 ) .",
    "beuermann and burwitz ( 1995 ) recently suggested that the amount of the soft excess is correlated with the strength of the magnetic field of the white dwarf .",
    "it is known that the hard x - ray continuum spectrum of magnetic cataclysmic variables ( mcvs ) can , to a first approximation , be fitted by an optically thin thermal plasma emission spectrum with a single temperature undergoing photoelectric absorption represented by a single hydrogen column density . to represent the spectra of intermediate polars , norton and watson ( 1989 ) introduced the so - called ` partial - covering absorber model ' in which photoelectric absorption was represented by two column densities .",
    "complex absorption was found also in polars with observations ( ishida and fujimoto 1995 ) .",
    "it has also been expected that the hard x - ray emitting hot plasma is gradually cooled by cyclotron emission and bremsstrahlung ( aizu 1973 , frank , king and lasota 1983 , imamura and durisen 1983 ) , and that the hard x - ray spectrum consists of multi - temperature emission components .",
    "such a multi - temperature emission spectrum was first suggested by an observation of ( singh & swank 1993 ) , and later was established by an observation ( ishida , mukai and osborne 1994 , fujimoto and ishida 1997 ) .",
    "note , however , that it is only for that the existence of multi - temperature emission is confirmed observationally .    was discovered during the search for supersoft x - ray sources in the all - sky survey data ( greiner , remillard and motch 1995 ) .",
    "greiner , remillard and motch ( 1995 , 1998 ) have analyzed all the data taken between 1990 september and 1993 september , and found a coherent period of 0.07847977(11 )  d ( = 1.8835145@xmath50.000003  hr ) .",
    "the pulse profile in the band @xmath6  kev is characterized by a deep intensity minimum , with basically no x - ray flux , lasting 0.1 orbital phase .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is characterized by strong blackbody emission with a temperature of @xmath7  ev , with a clear excess emission above 1  kev , which has been approximated by thermal bremsstrahlung with a temperature of 20  kev .",
    "the absorption - corrected 0.12.4  kev fluxes of the blackbody and the thermal bremsstrahlung components are @xmath8  erg  @xmath9s@xmath10 and @xmath11  erg  @xmath9s@xmath10 , respectively , suggesting a huge soft excess of nearly 90 in the 0.12.4 kev band . szkody ( 1995 ) carried out photometry , spectroscopy and polarimetry in the optical band , and found several characteristics of polars such as heii emission line stronger than h@xmath12 and circular polarization of 4% .",
    "all these properties strongly indicate that is a polar .    in this paper ,",

    "we summarize our results .",
    "the observation of was carried out between 1996 september 30.75 and october 2.96 ( ut ) .",
    "is equipped with four equivalent x - ray telescopes ( xrt : serlemitsos 1995 ) . in the common focal plane ,",
    "two solid - state imaging spectrometers ( sis : burke 1994 , yamashita 1997 ) and two gas imaging spectrometers ( gis : makishima 1996 , ohashi 1996 ) are mounted .",
    "the sis has high sensitivity in the lower energy bandpass and high energy resolution of @xmath13 ( at the time of launch ) , whereas the gis has high throughput in the higher energy bandpass and high time resolution .    throughout the observation ,",
    "the gis operated in pulse height normal mode in which the band 0.7 - 10  kev is covered by 1024 pulse height channels .",
    "the sis mode was switched between the 1-ccd faint mode in high bit rate and the 1-ccd bright mode in medium bit rate , which cover 0.4 - 10  kev with 4096 and 2048 pulse height channels , respectively .",
    "the observation was performed normally except for loss of data during october 1.571.83 ( ut ) because of a sudden cancelation of the deep space network service .",
    "we have screened the data with the following criteria . the data taken while the spacecraft passes the south atlantic anomaly are discarded . in order to avoid the earth - limb effect , we have only chosen data when the earth elevation angle of exceeds 5@xmath14 .",
    "in addition to this , we have also discarded the sis data while the elevation angle from the sunny earth limb is less than 10@xmath14 . for the sis ,",
    "we have skipped day - night transition periods of the spacecraft which occur during every satellite orbit . with these selection criteria ,",
    "some 77  ksec exposure time is retained for both the sis and the gis .    for the integration of the x - ray source photons",
    ", we have adopted an aperture of 37 and 40 in radius centered on for the sis and gis , respectively . for the background",
    ", the entire ccd chip outside the aperture is used for the sis ( there are no other x - ray sources within the field of view ) , whereas an annular region which has the same distance from the boresight of the xrt as the source - integration region is adopted for the gis .    in fig .",
    "[ lc ] , we show the light curve of from all the four detectors in the 0.510  kev band with 256  sec binning after the data screening as described above . because is a low - earth orbit satellite , the source is usually occulted by the earth every 96  min .",
    "( satellite orbital period ) . as mentioned in   2 ,",
    "approximately 6  hrs of data are lost in the middle of the observation due to a failure of data retrieval on a ground station .",
    "the average background - subtracted counting rate is 0.052  c  s@xmath10 with all the four detectors ( 0.035  c  s@xmath10 for the two sis , and 0.017  c  s@xmath10 for the two gis ) .",
    "[ flc ] shows the folded light curves from all the four detectors in the 0.510  kev band and in three separate energy bands . in folding the light curves ,",
    "we have adopted the ephemeris determined from and optical observations ( greiner , remillard and motch 1995 , 1998 ) , which is    @xmath15    this ephemeris is accurate enough to predict the time of the dip with an error of only several minutes ( phase uncertainty of @xmath16 ) at the time of the observation . however , unlike the light curves which show a modulation amplitude of 100% below 0.5  kev , the light curves are extremely flat except for a possible dip during the phase 1.01.1 . from the average counting rates of the two phase bins around phase 1.08 ,",
    "we have obtained the depth of the dip to be @xmath17% , @xmath18% and @xmath19% of the phase - averaged intensity for the bands 0.510  kev , 0.52  kev and 210  kev , respectively , at the 90% confidence level . with the dip duration and depth",
    ", it is possible for this dip to correspond to that found in the light curve , although this is not conclusive .",
    "if we assume that the dip seen in fig .",
    "[ flc ] is the same as the one in the observation , the best - fit period would become slightly longer ( 0.07848022(16 ) days ) but inconsistent with the rosat folding .",
    "since no remarkable intensity variation is found during the observation , we sum up all the data . according to the data selection criteria described in   2 , we have extracted the source and the background spectra separately for the four detectors .",
    "then we have summed the two sis spectra and the two gis spectra , and have created background subtracted sis and gis spectra , respectively .",
    "hereafter , we derive spectral parameters of by a combined fit of the sis and gis spectra using xspec version 9.01 ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we have first tried to fit the spectra with a single temperature optically thin thermal plasma model ( raymond and smith 1977 , hereafter referred to as r&s model ) undergoing photoelectric absorption .",
    "we note that a thermal bremsstrahlung model has conventionally been used to fit x - ray spectra of mcvs .",
    "however , optically thin thermal plasma also produces plenty of emission lines from abundant heavy elements . among them ,",
    "the iron @xmath20-lines appearing between 0.72  kev cause a significant excess above the continuum especially in the case that the plasma temperature is lower than @xmath21  kev .",
    "it is very difficult to resolve them from the continuum spectrum even with the high spectral resolution of the sis .",
    "in addition , there are a few more processes in the optically thin thermal plasma that produce continuum emission , such as the free - bound transition and the two - photon decay . under these circumstances",
    ", we can not estimate the continuum parameters if we use the thermal bremsstrahlung model .",
    "hence we will substitute the thermal bremsstrahlung model by a r&s model throughout this paper , except when fitting the spectrum in the band 410  kev , because the continuum in this band is always dominated by the thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "the result of the r&s model fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ wara ] , and the best fit parameters are listed in the third column of table  [ ascapara ] . although the fit seems good below @xmath02  kev , it obviously shows excess emission above @xmath02  kev .",
    "the most remarkable structure in the residual is the iron emission line appearing in the 67  kev band .",
    "if we evaluate this with a thermal bremsstrahlung model plus a gaussian line in the 410  kev band , the equivalent width becomes @xmath22  kev .",
    "note that observations indicated that the equivalent width was in the range 0.20.8  kev for a dozen of mcvs ( ishida and fujimoto 1995 ) .",
    "hence the equivalent width of is roughly an order of magnitude larger than that of mcvs observed by , indicating a greater abundance by the same order .    in order to explain the excess emission above the single component model",
    ", we have tried the two possibilities described in   1 , i.e. applying a partial - covering absorption model and introducing a second r&s component .",
    "we first have attempted to apply the partial - covering absorption model to the observed spectra .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ warawara ] and the best fit parameters are summarized in the 4th column of table  [ ascapara ] . the reduced @xmath23 value of 1.21 means that despite the improvement over the single r&s model the partial - covering absorption model is only marginally acceptable .",
    "the best fit values of the two hydrogen column densities are @xmath24 @xmath9 and @xmath25 @xmath9 and the covering fraction of the latter over the emission region is @xmath26% . from spectra",
    "a ratio of soft blackbody flux to hard bremsstrahlung flux of nearly 90 in the 0.12.4  kev band was deduced ( greiner , remillard and motch 1995 , 1998 ) .",
    "this extreme soft excess now vanishes because of the high covering fraction of the heavily absorbed component .",
    "but the model still does not reproduce the prominent iron emission line which is seen between 6 - 7  kev .",
    "we have thus added a gaussian , and have fitted the spectra again .",
    "the result is summarized in the 5th column of table  [ ascapara ] and shows that the @xmath23 value decreases by nearly 30 after adding two free parameters into the model .",
    "hence , the introduction of the gaussian is statistically justified .",
    "note , however , that the resulting line equivalent width becomes @xmath0  12  kev which is unacceptably large . since the temperature of the emission component is lower than 1  kev , it seems unlikely that this emission line comes from the hot plasma itself .",
    "the fluorescent iron emission line is , on the other hand , expected to emanate from the white dwarf surface illuminated by the hard x - ray emission .",
    "however , its equivalent width is estimated to be @xmath0  140  ev ( george and fabian 1991 , done 1994 , beardmore 1995 ) if the white dwarf surface has solar composition of heavy elements .",
    "therefore , the equivalent width determined from the fit indicates an abundance of the order of @xmath0100 times solar , which is in strong contradiction to the abundance from the r&s model , @xmath0  0.1 ( table  [ ascapara ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the partial - covering absorption model can not reproduce the observed spectrum in a physically consistent manner .    as the next step",
    ", we have tried to fit the hard excess component shown in fig .",
    "[ lc ] by introducing a second r&s component .",
    "the result of the fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ wararaga ] , and the best fit parameters are shown in the 6th column of table  [ ascapara ] .",
    "the fit is acceptable with a reduced @xmath23 value of 0.74 , suggesting that the x - ray spectrum of consists of multi - temperature optically thin thermal plasma emission components .",
    "the obtained flux is 4.8@xmath27 erg s@xmath10 @xmath9 in the band 210  kev .",
    "note that this fit still suggests a very high abundance of 6 times solar with a lower limit of 2.5 times solar , which seems too high for cataclysmic variables , because they are generally considered to be old systems .",
    "recently , hellier  ( 1998 ) compiled spectra of 15 mcvs from archival data .",
    "a total of 14 spectra out of the 15 show a significant fluorescent iron emission line at 6.41  kev , as well as the two thermal plasma components at 6.68  kev and 6.97  kev . among them ,",
    "the fluorescent component probably originates from the white dwarf surface ( done , osborne and beardmore 1995 ) .",
    "although the statistics of our data is not good enough to resolve these three components , it is necessary to include the fluorescent iron line into the model in evaluating the abundance correctly .",
    "we thus have introduced a gaussian line as representing the iron line of fluorescence origin .",
    "the result is summarized in the last column of table  [ ascapara ] .",
    "although the best fit abundance is reduced to @xmath00.9 , the equivalent width of the fluorescent iron line becomes around 2  kev .",
    "this value again indicates an abundance of more than 10 times solar .",
    "clearly , the abundances estimated from the intensities of iron lines of the hot plasma origin and of the fluorescence origin should be consistent .",
    "this point will be discussed in ",
    "4 . note also that the high abundance can affect the estimation of the bolometric luminosity of the hard component , since the line emission predominates among all the cooling processes in the plasma the temperature of which is less than 2  kev ( mccray 1987 ) .",
    "we therefore calculate the bolometric luminosity of the hard optically thin thermal component later in relation with the abundance .",
    "greiner , remillard and motch ( 1995 , 1998 ) reported that the flux of the soft blackbody component is greater than that of the hard thin thermal plasma emission by two orders of magnitude in the band 0.12.4  kev .",
    "we have attempted to re - examine this extreme soft excess in combination with the hard x - ray data .    pointed four times between 1992 october and 1993 september .",
    "we have extracted a mean pspc spectrum from the observation on 1993 september 11/12 ( the exposure time of which was @xmath0  13  ksec , the longest of all the pointing observations ) .",
    "details of the observations are presented in greiner , remillard and motch ( 1998 ) ( see also greiner , remillard and motch 1995 ) .    since the observation is not simultaneous with the observation , we have first checked if the intensity levels of the two observations are consistent . to do this",
    ", we have used the pspc and the sis and gis spectral channels below 2  kev , and have fitted a model consisting of a soft blackbody and a hard thin thermal plasma spectrum undergoing photoelectric absorption represented by a common hydrogen column density .",
    "although the temperatures of both components , the normalization of the blackbody as well as the abundance of the thin thermal plasma are constrained to be the same among the three spectra , the normalization of the thin thermal component is set free to vary independently ( note that the blackbody parameters are determined solely by the pspc spectrum ) .",
    "the resulting normalizations of the hard thin thermal emission of the sis / gis relative to that of the pspc are 1.03 and 1.09 , respectively , with a typical statistical error of @xmath28 .",
    "we thus regard the intensity level of the hard component as the same between the and the observations .",
    "next , we have performed a combined spectral fit in the entire 0.110  kev band with a model composed of a blackbody and a two temperature thin thermal plasma emission component .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ wabbrara ] .",
    "the fit is marginally acceptable at the 90% confidence level , with @xmath29 of 1.15 for 83 degrees of freedom .",
    "the confidence contours for the hydrogen column density and the temperature of the blackbody component are also shown in fig .",
    "[ wabbrara ] .",
    "the best fit temperature of the blackbody is obtained to be @xmath30  ev for two parameters of interest .",
    "the observed flux of the blackbody is @xmath31 erg @xmath9 s@xmath10 in the band 0.12.4  kev .",
    "after @xmath2 correction , the flux becomes @xmath32 erg @xmath9 s@xmath10 , which is @xmath3 times as large as that of the hard component in the 210  kev band (    3.3 ) .",
    "the major difference to greiner , remillard and motch ( 1998 ) is that the blackbody temperature now is even lower than in the fit of the  data alone , because a part of the emission around @xmath330.5 kev is now attributed to the low - kt r&s component .",
    "because the blackbody temperature is very low , it is very difficult to calculate the bolometric luminosity of the blackbody , because even the pspc can observe only the high energy end of the wien tail .",
    "assuming a disc - shape emission region and a distance of 100  pc , we obtain a bolometric luminosity of the blackbody component @xmath34 of @xmath35 erg s@xmath10/@xmath36 for the best fit temperature of 15  ev , where @xmath36 implies the cosine of the angle between the normal of the disk and the line of sight",
    ". however , the 90% confidence range of @xmath34 becomes @xmath37 erg s@xmath10 for the temperature of 2210  ev .      to further constrain the spectral parameters of the soft ( blackbody ) component ,",
    "we have utilized the observation performed on 1995 aug .",
    "31 ( shrader 1997 ) . among the several exposures of , we collected the data taken out of the x - ray eclipse , which are swp55775/6 and lwp31382 using the ephemeris of greiner , remillard and motch ( 1998 ) . for swp",
    ", we took the time average of the two exposures . in fig .",
    "[ allcombine ] , we have plotted the spectra thus obtained together with @xmath2-corrected spectra of ( @xmath38  ev ) and in a @xmath39 diagram .",
    "note that we have not corrected the color of the spectrum .",
    "the correction factor at 1000   is , however , less than 2 from the hydrogen column density @xmath40  @xmath9 ( greiner , remillard and motch 1998 ) , and even smaller at longer wavelengths .    we have also shown the @xmath2-corrected best fit blackbody spectra obtained from the simultaneous and spectral fitting (    3.4 ) .",
    "it is obvious that the shape of the spectrum does not correspond ( at least in the long - wavelength region ) to that of the blackbody extrapolation , and therefore represents a separate emission component .",
    "thus , the allowed @xmath41-corrected blackbody curves have to be below the spectrum , constraining the blackbody temperature to the range 2022  ev .",
    "the corresponding bolometric luminosity of the blackbody is obtained to be 25@xmath42 erg s@xmath10/@xmath36 for a distance of 100  pc .",
    "we note that using a white dwarf atmosphere model will predominantly reduce @xmath34 but result in a rather similar effective temperature .",
    "as shown in    3.2 , the folded light curve shows little evidence of orbital modulation , while the low energy light curves show a deep x - ray intensity modulation with an amplitude of 100% .",
    "this probably implies that the accretion pole moves around in the hemisphere of the white dwarf which is visible from the observer , and the x - ray modulation is caused by photoelectric absorption in the accretion column , as is also the case for the recently discovered new polar ( misaki 1996 , thomas and reinsch 1996 ) .    from the and light curves",
    ", we can estimate the hydrogen column density of the accretion column passing over the line of sight . assuming the absorption by the column",
    "can be represented by a single hydrogen column density and the absorbing matter is cold , the pspc response function predicts @xmath43  @xmath9 for the counting rate in the band 0.10.5  kev to be reduced by 95% , if the blackbody parameters are the same as those out of the eclipse . on the other hand , for the counting rate ( sis+gis ) to be reduced less than 20% in the band 0.510  kev , the sis and the gis responses require @xmath44  @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the hydrogen column density of the accretion column passing over the line of sight at the time of eclipse is @xmath45  @xmath9 on condition that the absorber is cold and can be characterized by a single hydrogen column density .",
    "as noted in greiner , remillard , motch ( 1998 ) , however , a detailed analysis of the energy resolved light curve of indicates that the absorption by the column can hardly be reconciled with a single hydrogen column density .",
    "it is possible that the pre - shock column is ionized in part or has a distribution in @xmath2 in the range 10@xmath46  @xmath9 .      as explained in   1",
    ", the hard x - ray spectrum of mcvs can usually be modelled by thermal bremsstrahlung with a single temperature in the range 1040  kev ( ishida and fujimoto 1995 ) .",
    "although theories of the postshock accretion flow predict that the postshock plasma is cooled via thermal bremsstrahlung ( aizu 1973 ) and also cyclotron radiation ( wu 1994 , woelk and beuermann 1996 ) evidence of this cooling has been difficult to find observationally , because a thick ( @xmath47 @xmath9 ) , partial - covering absorption caused by the accretion column prevents us from measuring the shape of the intrinsic spectrum .",
    "the only exception is in which the hard x - ray continuum emission can be represented by a two temperature r&s model ( @xmath48  0.8  kev and 8  kev ) at first order approximation , and the ionization temperatures of heavy elements distribute in the range 0.98  kev ( ishida , mukai and osborne 1994 ) .",
    "fujimoto and ishida ( 1997 ) showed that the distribution of the ionization temperatures is consistent with the postshock cooling flow predicted by aizu ( 1973 ) , and successfully determined the shock temperature and the mass of the white dwarf .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of also requires two temperature r&s components , and is similar to that of .",
    "we believe that observed the postshock cooling flow in .",
    "this finding probably indicates that the temperature distribution due to the postshock cooling is a common feature among mcvs , and one always finds this as long as the low energy absorption is weak enough ( @xmath49  @xmath9 ) as in and .      as displayed in   3 , the hard part of the x - ray spectrum of has a strong iron emission line with an equivalent width of @xmath0  4  kev .",
    "the line originates from the hot plasma , and also , probably from the white dwarf surface via fluorescence ( hellier , mukai and osborne 1998 ) .",
    "however , these two components can not be resolved because of statistical limitations . in obtaining the elemental abundance of the plasma , we have to mix these two components so that the abundances they give are consistent .    as shown in table  [ ascapara ] , the temperature of the hard excess component is uncertain , with a lower limit of @xmath0  7  kev .",
    "therefore , we have fixed the temperature of the plasma at several trial values between 7 and 30 kev , and have made the following analysis .",
    "first , we have adopted thermal bremsstrahlung as the continuum spectrum .",
    "then we have added three gaussian lines which represent the fluorescent component at @xmath0  6.4  kev , and he - like and hydrogenic components at 6.68  kev and 6.97  kev , respectively , and have performed the spectral fitting in the band 410  kev . in doing this , we have assumed that all the lines are narrow .",
    "also the line central energies of the plasma components are fixed at 6.68  kev and 6.97  kev .",
    "the intensities of all the lines are constrained so that they give the same abundance at each fixed temperature . as mentioned in    3.3",
    ", the equivalent width of the fluorescent component should be 140  ev , almost irrespective of the plasma temperature , if the white dwarf surface has solar composition .",
    "on the other hand , the equivalent widths of the plasma components can be obtained from the atomic data table in raymond and smith ( 1977 ) or mewe ( 1985 ) as a function of the plasma temperature in the case of solar composition plasma .",
    "therefore , the free parameters of the lines are only two  the central energy and the normalization of the fluorescent line .",
    "the fitting result thus obtained is shown in fig .",
    "[ ablumi ] .    the resulting abundance is larger for higher trial temperature .",
    "this is a result of the fact that @xmath50shell electrons are increasingly stripped off for higher temperatures , and hence a higher iron abundance is necessary to account for the observed equivalent width .",
    "the smallest abundance is obtained to be 2.4@xmath51 at a temperature of 7  kev , which implies the lower limit of the abundance to be 1.3@xmath52 .",
    "note , however , that this is a very conservative lower limit , and the abundance based on the iron emission line is probably several times as large as that of solar composition .",
    "this is in contrast to the abundances of cvs which have recently been measured to be sub - solar , such as @xmath53 for ( fujimoto and ishida 1997 ) , @xmath54 for ( ishida 1997 ) , and @xmath55 for ss  cyg ( done and osborne 1997 ) .",
    "a hint for a larger abundance than solar is obtained only for ( misaki 1996 ) .",
    "since we have obtained the abundance in the previous section , we have next calculated the bolometric luminosity of the hard x - ray component .",
    "to do this , we have adopted the volume emissivity formulas of the optically thin plasma approximated by mccray ( 1987 ) , but modified to take into account the abundance effects .",

    "the second term represents that of the free - free emission .",
    "note that the first term is greater than the second term in the range @xmath60  kev .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the hard component @xmath61 is obtained by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the emission measure obtained from the spectral fitting for the 0.8  kev component and the hard excess component separately by assuming a distance to the source .",
    "the luminosity thus calculated for the trial temperatures is plotted in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ ablumi ] showing a rather flat dependence with temperature in the 730  kev range : @xmath64 erg s@xmath10 .",

    "we have obtained the lower limit of the bolometric luminosity of the blackbody component @xmath67 to be @xmath68 erg s@xmath10 from and simultaneous spectral fitting .",
    "this means @xmath69 .",
    "if we also take data into account (    3.5 ) , @xmath67 is constrained in the range @xmath70 erg s@xmath10 , and hence @xmath71 is obtained .",
    "note that white dwarf atmosphere models could possibly reduce the luminosity of the soft component , and thus also @xmath72 .      in    3.4 ,",
    "we have derived the temperature of the soft blackbody component to be @xmath30  ev . the best fit value is outside the ` usual ' range derived by szkody ( 1995 ) , namely 2045  ev . in estimating the blackbody temperature , szkody ( 1995 ) assumed a thermal bremsstrahlung component with a temperature of 10  kev for the hard x - ray component .",
    "however , based on our data we have found a spectral component which can be represented by a r&s spectrum with @xmath73  0.8  kev . the r&s component with such low temperature has a forest of iron emission lines in the 0.81  kev band caused by the iron l - shell transitions ( raymond and smith 1977 ) .",
    "hence , a significant amount of the flux in the 0.82  kev band is attributed to the low temperature r&s component in our modelling .",
    "note that this can not happen if we assume a thermal bremsstrahlung component with a temperature of 10  kev . as a result ,",
    "the blackbody temperature becomes lower than the estimates in szkody ( 1995 ) .    in analyzing data",
    ", one usually assumes the temperature of the hard x - ray component to be around 20  kev ( ramsay 1994 , for example ) . as shown here , however , this may cause a huge systematic error in evaluating the luminosity and the temperature of the soft blackbody component .",
    "we presented x - ray data of obtained by . from the light",
    "curves we find only marginal evidence for orbital intensity modulation which is seen in the light curve below 0.5  kev characterized by the sharp and deep minima . from this energy dependence , we conclude that the intensity modulation is caused mostly by photoelectric absorption in the pre - shock accretion column , and the accreting pole moves around on the hemisphere visible from the observer , consistent with the conclusions from greiner , remillard & motch ( 1998 ) .",
    "it is possible that the line of sight absorber is partly ionized or has a distribution in @xmath41 in the range 10@xmath46  @xmath9 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum can be represented by a two temperature optically thin thermal plasma emission model with temperatures of @xmath0  1  kev and @xmath1  7  kev . in analogy with , we deduce that observed the cooling of the postshock plasma , as indicated by the theory of the postshock accretion flow .",
    "a remarkable feature of the x - ray spectrum of  is the strong iron emission line whose equivalent width is @xmath74  kev . to account for this",
    ", an iron abundance greater than solar by at least 1.3 times is required . from the combined analysis of the pspc and spectra ,",
    "the ratio of the bolometric luminosity of the soft component to the hard is revealed to be greater than 140 .",
