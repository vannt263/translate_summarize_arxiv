    "<S> motivated by the recent observation of the @xmath0-mode signal in the cosmic microwave background by bicep2 , we study the starobinsky - type inflation model in the framework of old - minimal supergravity , where the inflaton field in the original ( non - supersymmetric ) starobinsky inflation model is promoted to a complex field . </S>",
    "<S> we study how the inflaton evolves on the two - dimensional field space , varying the initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that ( i ) one of the scalar fields has a very steep potential once the trajectory is off from that of the original starobinsky inflation , and that ( ii ) the @xmath0-mode signal observed by bicep2 is too large to be consistent with the prediction of the model irrespective of the initial conditions . </S>",

    "<S> this is because the starobinsky inflation predicts @xmath6 of the order of @xmath7 , which is significantly smaller than the bicep2 result .    </S>",
    "<S> if one extends the model , this conclusion may change . </S>",
    "<S> the extension we consider in the present study is to supersymmetrize the model because supersymmetry is a prominent candidate of the physics beyond the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> in such a model , the inflation can still be realized solely by the gravitational sector , while new scalar degrees of freedom are automatically introduced , which may affect the dynamics of inflation .    </S>",
    "<S> the starobinsky model is based on a modified theory of gravity , so we need to consider a modified theory of supergravity . </S>",
    "<S> there are two minimal off - shell formulations of supergravity : the old - minimal  @xcite and the new - minimal  @xcite supergravity . </S>",
    "<S> supergravity embedding of starobinsky model has been studied both in the old - minimal  @xcite and the new - minimal  @xcite supergravities . </S>",
    "<S> these studies share the original philosophy of the starobinsky model in the sense that the supergravity generalizations of the model rely solely on ( super)geometrical or ( super)gravitational quantities .   </S>",
    "<S> the old - minimal realization of starobinsky model is possible with generic `` khler potential '' and `` superpotential '' of scalar curvature supermultiplet with extra propagating scalar degrees of freedom other than the inflaton ( also called scalaron )  @xcite . imposing a constraint @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> , one can construct the old - minimal higher - curvature supergravity with only one ( pseudo)scalar in addition to the scalaron  @xcite . even in this case , the discussion after eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : retimt ] ) holds . on the contrary </S>",
    "<S> , the new - minimal realization has a higgsed ( massive ) vector field as well as the inflaton  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we consider the old - minimal supergravity because it automatically introduces new scalar degrees of freedom .    in this letter , we study the starobinsky - type inflation model in the framework of old - minimal supergravity . </S>",
    "<S> we pay particular attention to the fact that there exist two scalar degrees of freedom originating from the gravity multiplet in such a model . </S>",
    "<S> we study the evolution of the inflaton on the two - dimensional field space . </S>",
    "<S> we will see that the potential of one of the scalar fields becomes very steep once the trajectory is off from that of the original starobinsky inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the tensor - to - scalar ratio in the supergravity starobinsky model is too small to be consistent with the bicep2 result even though the field space is enlarged .    </S>",

    "<S> the second term leads to the kinetic term of the new degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> however , this term produces the scalar potential unbounded below in the region of large @xmath35 . </S>",

    "<S> small @xmath36 makes other local minima near the original minimum ( @xmath37 ) . </S>",
    "<S> because of these reasons , we take a sufficiently large value of @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> note that , for sufficiently large @xmath36 , @xmath30 is stabilized for any value of @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> we also assume @xmath38 so that the potential value at the vacuum is zero . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath30 is set to the minimum @xmath39 , and the resultant effective theory has two fields @xmath28 and @xmath29 with only one parameter @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> after stabilization of @xmath30 , the lagrangian density is given by @xmath41 canonical normalization of both fields at the same time is impossible in this case . </S>",
    "<S> we find it useful to define the semi - canonical basis that does not have kinetic mixing and realizes canonical normalization at the vacuum ( @xmath42):alternatively , one may transform @xmath29 into canonically normalized form by @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> then the potential for @xmath44 is also simplified , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the starobinsky potential . however , in this basis , @xmath47 is no more canonically normalized and there is a kinetic mixing between @xmath47 and @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48 then , the lagrangian density becomes @xmath49 the third term is the starobinsky potential . </S>",
    "<S> looking at the second and fourth terms , one may naively guess that chaotic inflation  @xcite is possible neglecting the common factor @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> however , as we shall see , this exponential factor strongly drives @xmath47 to the positive direction in the large @xmath51 region .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us investigate if the fields @xmath47 and/or @xmath51 play the role of inflaton which are responsible for the present density fluctuations of our universe . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose , we first study the evolution of these fields . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution equations for @xmath47 and @xmath51 are given by @xmath52 where the `` dot '' denotes the derivative with respect to time @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( with @xmath55 being the scale factor ) is the expansion rate of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> when the energy density of the universe is dominated by that of @xmath25 , we obtain @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the total energy density : @xmath58 by solving the above equations numerically , we follow the trajectories of @xmath47 and @xmath51 with various initial values .     plane . </S>",
    "<S> the green closed contour at around the minimum ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath59 ) corresponds @xmath60 , while other green lines represent the contours of @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 from right to left . </S>",
    "<S> the solid red , solid blue , dashed red , and dashed blue lines represent the evolutions of the fields with initial conditions @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> note that dashed lines overlap with the solid lines for @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> points with numbers show the @xmath72-folding numbers for each trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> the trajectories are terminated at the end of inflation ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath73 ) . </S>",
    "<S> , width=377 ]    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1:trajectory ] , we show the contours of the potential and the evolutions of the fields on @xmath74 plane . as representative initial conditions , we choose @xmath75 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the initial values of @xmath76 and @xmath77 are taken to be zero . ) with such initial conditions , we can see that @xmath25 starts to move to the @xmath47 direction first , then it settles to the real axis ( i.e. , @xmath78 ) . after reaching to the real axis </S>",
    "<S> , the motion of @xmath25 is well approximated by the single - field inflation with @xmath47 ; the situation is almost the same as the non - supersymmetric original starobinsky inflation . as can be seen from the dashed lines , the trajectories are almost unchanged even if @xmath47 starts from @xmath79 .    on each contour , in particular for @xmath80 , we show several points which give rise to some specific values of the @xmath72-folding numbers until the end of inflation . here </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath72-folding number is defined as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the time at the end of inflation . in our analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we define it by @xmath83 , where the slow - roll parameter @xmath84 is given by @xmath85 we have used the einstein equation in the last equality . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that the change of the @xmath72-folding value in the period of @xmath86 is small . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a large value of the @xmath72-folding number during inflation , which is necessary to solve the horizon and flatness problems , should be accumulated when @xmath25 is on the real axis .     as a function of the @xmath72-folding number @xmath87 , for the initial conditions @xmath88 ( red line ) and @xmath89 ( blue line ) . the dashed line , corresponding to @xmath90 , is drawn to guide the eyes . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath87 decreases with time . , width=377 ]    for @xmath91 and @xmath92 , the expansion of the universe is accelerating and decelerating , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for inflation to happen , @xmath91 is necessary . to see when the expansion is accelerating , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2:epsh ] , we plot @xmath84 as a function of @xmath87 , taking @xmath93 and @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that , just after the start of the motion , @xmath84 significantly increases and soon becomes larger than @xmath95 . in this period , </S>",
    "<S> the expansion of the universe is decelerating and not inflating . </S>",
    "<S> the drop of @xmath84 at @xmath96 ( 45 ) in the red ( blue ) line corresponds to the point at which @xmath51 becomes most negative and @xmath97 ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1:trajectory ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , the universe transits from the decelerating epoch to the starobinsky - type inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we call the period in between as `` transition period , '' and the period of the starobinsky - like expansion as `` starobinsky - inflation period . '' </S>",
    "<S> the important point is that the transition period is very short ; during the transition period , @xmath87 changes @xmath98 or so . </S>",
    "<S> ( for the case of @xmath99 , for example , the transition period corresponds to @xmath100 . ) </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that the motion of @xmath51 becomes suppressed soon after the condition @xmath91 is satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> if we require that the causal connection be realized for the scale much longer than @xmath101 ( with @xmath102 being the wavenumber corresponding to the present hubble scale ) , the mode with the wavenumber @xmath102 should leave the horizon in the starobinsky - inflation period . then , the tensor - to - scalar ratio becomes @xmath103 and is too small to be consistent with the value given in eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the light of the recent bicep2 result , the starobinsky inflation is disfavored even if the field space is complexified in the framework of old - minimal supergravity .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the possibilities to change this conclusion may be to consider the case where the mode with @xmath102 exits the horizon in the transition period . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a solution looks unlikely . even though the density fluctuations with the wavenumber @xmath104 may be altered </S>",
    "<S> , fluctuations with the wavenumber @xmath105 larger than @xmath106 have almost the same property as those in the case of starobinsky inflation . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , for the angular scale of @xmath107 with @xmath108 , the density perturbations behave as those in the starobinsky model . </S>",
    "<S> the bicep experiment is sensitive to the @xmath0-mode signal with @xmath109 , while the scalar - mode fluctuations for such an angular scale is well studied by using cmb and other observables . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the present model , it is difficult to enhance the tensor - mode fluctuations without conflicting observations . </S>"
