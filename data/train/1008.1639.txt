    "for example , there are some searchable instances of `` moving bottlenecks '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig : moving ] ) , possibly caused by very slow special transports or obstructions due to `` moving road works '' ( such as mowing the median lawn ) .",
    "we notice that all proposed quantities for calibrating and testing relate to existing congestions . due to the stochastic nature of the perturbations eventually leading to a breakdown , predictions for an actual breakdown are necessarily restricted to a probabilistic level  @xcite .",
    "it must be emphasized that calibrations based on microscopic quantities such as the difference between measured and simulated gaps are strongly influenced by unpredictable intra- and inter - driver variations  @xcite resulting in little discriminative power  @xcite .",
    "however , when calibrating against integrated quantities such as the traveling time  @xcite , important aspects such as accelerations or the properties of oscillations are averaged away resulting in reduced discriminative power as well .",
    "in contrast , the schemes proposed here probe the traffic dynamics on the intermediate scale of individual oscillations which is of the order of one kilometer and a few minutes .",
    "since we probe on collective phenomena , inter- and intra - driver variabilities should only play a minor role .",

    "we therefore expect that the proposed schemes can be applied to a better and more discriminative benchmarking of microscopic and macroscopic models with respect to traffic instabilities .",
