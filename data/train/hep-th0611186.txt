    "it is a modern achievement that gauge theories and in particular supersymmetric gauge theories _ hide _ many realisations of the algebraic geometry theorisation ( cf .",
    "@xcite just as a recent monumental reference on the _ last _ discovered parallel and many other features ) .",
    "more in specific , the ads / cft correspondence @xcite should be a general dictionary , which would equate  among other physical objects  energies of string states to anomalous dimensions of local gauge - invariant operators of a dual conformal quantum field theory . proving or even testing this duality in full generality may be a formidable task , but the integrability properties of the @xmath4 super yang - mills ( sym ) theory have proved to be extremely useful to understand how it may work and to which extent .",
    "the identification @xcite of the one - loop dilatation operator of scalar gauge - invariant fields with bare dimension @xmath2 with an @xmath8 integrable chain with @xmath2 sites , reducing in the @xmath0 subspace to the spin @xmath9-xxx heisenberg chain , allowed , by using the bethe ansatz technique @xcite , to test the one - loop ads / cft duality in many cases @xcite beyond the bmn conditions @xcite . in the aforementioned cases ,",
    "special emphasis has been delivered to the @xmath10 correction , as this would result as the first quantum correction in string theory ; and more generally all the finite size @xmath2 corrections would have a similar stringy origin and importance . soon afterwards , integrability of @xmath4 sym at higher loops started to be hinted and hunted @xcite .",
    "after various attempts and tests ( cf .",
    "for instance @xcite ) , eventually in @xcite an all loop asymptotic expression has been proposed for the eigenvalues of the dilatation operator in the @xmath0 sub - sector , in terms of the solutions of bethe ansatz - like equations , derived by assuming bmn scaling and perturbative integrability . moreover ,",
    "this proposal ( named after them bds equations ) was shown to give the correct ( truncated ) bethe equations for the five loop dilatation operator , after deriving the latter as an operator . nevertheless , the bds equations are valid only asymptotically , that is for fixed @xmath2 when the t hooft coupling @xmath3 is small enough that the @xmath11 term ( @xmath2 loops ) may be neglected along with the higher order powers .",
    "in fact , the higher loops are clearly affected by the chain wrapping problem  namely an interaction range longer than the chain length  which is not taken into account by the bds proposal . in this respect ,",
    "an important progress was the remark , by rej , serban and staudacher @xcite , that the @xmath0 dilatation operator could be reproduced up to three loops by the strong coupling expansion of the hamiltonian of the half - filled hubbard model .",
    "many tests of the proposal @xcite started to be performed ( cf .",
    "for instance @xcite ) , while it seems now clear that starting from four loops the hubbard model will reproduce only part of the entire contributions ( likely the rational ones ) , the string theory / gauge theory discrepancies motivating the introduction of a specific dressing factor @xcite also in gauge theory . indeed",
    ", although the dressing factor would also care for the large @xmath3 behaviour , it is unclear for now how to insert it into the two lieb - wu bethe equations for the hubbard model @xcite . on the contrary , it is manifest its introduction into the bds bethe ansatz , and therefore a comparative study of bds versus hubbard model is one of the motivations of this paper .    in a previous paper @xcite we proposed a description of the highest and immediately lower energy states , for both the @xmath8 chain and the bds model , based on the non - linear integral equation ( nlie ) .",
    "the nlie was first introduced in @xcite for studying the finite size scaling of the ground state and of the excited states in ( critical and off - critical ) statistical ( lattice ) field theories respectively . although it is equivalent to the set of all the bethe ansatz equations , it is often more suitable for numerical and analytical calculations , especially when it is important , like in the present case , to detect how the anomalous dimension ( energy ) behaves with the length @xmath2 ( especially in large @xmath2 investigations ) .",
    "in fact , it condensates into a single ( or only very few ) integral equation(s ) many algebraic equations . in this respect",
    ", we will prove here that it is a right tool to deal with the two possible ordering of the limits of large size @xmath2 and large coupling @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , we will find a systematic way to perform the two expansions for small coupling and large coupling at any fixed size .    in this paper",
    "we want to introduce the nlies as a profitable treatment of the hubbard model , especially for the understanding of the exact scaling behaviour of the dimension ( energy ) with @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "we will concentrate on the highest energy ( anomalous dimension ) state of the half - filled hubbard model ( @xmath0 sub - sector of @xmath4 sym ) .",
    "this state is described by two coupled nlies which will be written in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we will give an exact expression for its energy , as a function of the coupling @xmath12 and the length of the chain @xmath2 , in terms of the solution of the two coupled nlies .",
    "this peculiar expression for the energy allows a comparison at large length @xmath2 ( section 5 ) with the analogous result coming from the bds chain : we will show that the @xmath10 leading term and all the next finite size corrections ( power - like and logarithmic ) in fact coincide ( i.e. the usual large @xmath2 asymptotic expansion do coincide ) , the difference being captured by exponentially small corrections ( whose leading contribution we estimated at strong coupling ) . moreover , as a consistency check of our findings , in section 6 the weak and strong coupling limits of the nlies on one hand and of the energy on the other hand will be studied and shown to reproduce the known results .",
    "the strong coupling for the bds model is also carefully analysed . as a consequence , section 7",
    "is devoted to the understanding of the ordering of the two distinct limits @xmath13 and @xmath14 , both in the hubbard and bds models .",
    "eventually , a detailed numerical analysis is carried out in the last section 8 .",
    "the hubbard model was introduced as a simplified model for strongly correlated electrons on a lattice @xcite . in one dimension",
    ", it describes @xmath15 electrons moving on a chain with @xmath2 sites and interacting via the hamiltonian @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 are ( fermionic ) canonical creation and annihilation operators respectively , @xmath19 is the strength of the kinetic nearest - neighbour hopping term , @xmath20 the coupling constant of the density potential and , for our interests , periodic boundary conditions are assumed , i.e. @xmath21 , @xmath22 .    in the relevant paper @xcite ,",
    "a precise sub - set of the energies @xmath23 of ( [ hubbham ] ) was conjectured to be proportional to the anomalous contribution @xmath24 to the conformal dimensions in the @xmath0 scalar sector of @xmath4 super yang - mills theory in the planar limit , @xmath25 provided we restrict ourselves to the half - filling case @xmath26 and also equate the length @xmath2 to the number of constituent operators .",
    "now , a very important part of the correspondence between an integrable system and a gauge theory is the mapping of the coupling constants , and the latter can be easily argued to be a strong - weak coupling duality for many reasonsxxx revealed , originally , at one loop by minahan and zarembo @xcite . ] .",
    "therefore , one possible choice , reproducing the known results up to three loops , may well be @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the t hooft coupling of the @xmath29 sym theory in the planar limit ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "but this can be modified by higher order contributions still preserving , of course , the matching outcomes . actually , to have a loop expansion of ( [ andim ] ) in @xmath31 with the right _ wrapping phenomenon _ occurring at @xmath32 , we need to introduce a constant magnetic flux @xmath33 @xcite , @xmath34 distinguishing odd and even lengths : @xmath35 when @xmath2 is odd and @xmath36 when @xmath2 is even .",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian ( [ hubbham ] ) describes an integrable model ( infinite many conserved charges in involution ) , which was diagonalised by lieb and wu by bethe ansatz in 1968 @xcite .",
    "the twisted hamiltonian ( [ hubbham2 ] ) is still integrable and the lieb - wu equations easily generalise . in the half - filling case they read @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of down spins .",
    "the spectrum of the hamiltonian is then given in terms of the pseudo - momenta @xmath39 , by the _ free dispersion relation _",
    "@xmath40 starting from here , we will equivalently derive two coupled nonlinear integral equations ( nlies ) for the antiferromagnetic state of the model at any value of @xmath2 , thanks to the methods used in @xcite .",
    "for reason of completeness , we point out that the thermodynamics ( infinite length @xmath2 , but finite temperature ) of the hubbard model has been studied @xcite by means of three nlies ( for a summary of the procedure and a complete list of references see @xcite ) .",
    "this approach was based on the equivalence of the ( quantum ) one - dimensional hubbard model with the ( classical ) two - dimensional shastry model . for the gauge theory understanding , we need to obtain energies of the hubbard model at zero temperature , but at any value of the length @xmath2 .",
    "this completely justifies our approach , and _ a fortiori _ in the perspective of extending our calculations to excited states ( i.e. lower dimension operators in the sym spectrum ) .",
    "looking at the bethe equations ( [ beqs ] ) , we define the function @xmath41 with the branch cut of @xmath42 along the real negative @xmath43-axis in such a way that @xmath44 .",
    "then , we perform a gauge transformation which amounts to adding the magnetic flux : @xmath45 after a possible choice of the counting functions as @xmath46 we can rewrite the bethe equations , by taking their logarithm , in the usual form of quantisation conditions for the bethe roots @xmath47 , @xmath48 from now on , we specialise our treatment to the highest energy state , consisting of the maximum number @xmath49 of real roots @xmath50 and of @xmath2 real roots @xmath51 . for simplicity reasons , we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath52 ( the remaining case @xmath53 is a simple modification of this case ) , which obviously implies @xmath54 .    in the definition of the counting functions ( [ wdef ] , [ zdef ] ) we have to deal with sums of functions computed on real bethe roots , @xmath51 and @xmath50 . let us first concentrate on functions of @xmath51 .",
    "we notice that @xmath51 may run only within the first brillouin zone @xmath55 and that the functions of @xmath51 involved are periodic with period @xmath56 . on the other hand ,",
    "the counting function @xmath57 is quasi - periodic on that interval and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are indeed periodic . using the cauchy theorem to circulate the interval @xmath55 by a small displacement @xmath60 ( this periodic case has been developed in @xcite ) , we get @xmath61 where the two complex integrals along @xmath62 at @xmath63 have been neglected thanks to the periodicity properties of @xmath64 and @xmath58 . a thumb rule to understand this _",

    "[ konishi1 ] that the first line which separates is the one corresponding to ( [ powexph ] ) and the second is ( [ powexpbds ] ) . in the small image",
    "we have magnified the region where the perturbative expansions and the exact curves separate .",
    "the emergence of such a behaviour can be explained by the appearance of rapidly growing coefficients in both the hubbard model and bds ansatz cases ) integers and so are the bds ones if @xmath12 is properly re - scaled . ]",
    "@xmath325    another interesting check is given by the comparison of our numerical results with the exact ( implicit ) form for the anomalous dimension of the konishi operator given by minahan in @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ nliemin ] , we found a complete agreement within the numerical precision of our computation .",
    "this allowed us to estimate our relative error to be less than @xmath326 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , even if @xmath2 is not at all large , the difference between the exact curves for hubbard and bds remains small as @xmath12 is increased .",
    "this fact seems to suggest that the bds ansatz can be considered as a good approximation of the hubbard model even when @xmath12 is large ( i.e. non - perturbative ) and @xmath2 is fixed to a small value ( and not only in the limit of infinite chain ) .    from this point of view",
    "it would be nice to study what happens in the strong coupling regime .",
    "unfortunately such a regime is difficult to reach with the numerical integration of our nlies , because of a reduced numerical precision for large @xmath12 .",
    "however , it is possible to use the strong coupling expansions eq .",
    "( [ strcoup ] ) for the present @xmath323 case .",
    "we obtain @xmath327 this result is interesting for two reasons .",
    "firstly , it shows that already for @xmath323 the strong coupling prediction for the bds ansatz is a good approximation of the corresponding result obtained in the hubbard model .",
    "moreover , one can see that the strong coupling expansions smoothly joins the numerical data in fig .",
    "[ konishi1 ] : we will further comment on this issue in the next section where we will analyse operators of intermediate length .      since our equations are suitable to the study of the energy at any @xmath2 , we can use them to analyze operators of intermediate length .",
    "this is the case where the nlies can be exploited at their best , because in such an intermediate regime it is quite difficult to directly use the bethe ansatz equations due to the large number of terms . in particular",
    "we choose to analyze highest energy states with length @xmath328 and @xmath329 .",

    "let us begin with @xmath328 .",
    "figure [ antif12 ] shows that already at such a small value of @xmath2 , and beyond the perturbative region in the coupling @xmath12 , the curves computed by means of both bds ansatz and hubbard model overlap almost completely .",
    "this is an indication that even if we are dealing with a chain which is far from the thermodynamic limit , the predictions of the bds ansatz can be considered as a good effective approximation of the hubbard model behaviour .    hence , even if the bds ansatz is plagued by the wrapping problem , at a quantitative level it is able to reproduce all the significant features of the hubbard model , beginning from @xmath333 .",
    "again , we use eqs . ( [ strcoup ] ) to describe the strong coupling behaviour @xmath334 the behaviour from weak to strong coupling for both the hubbard model and the bds anstaz is plotted in fig .",
    "[ ws ] : the left branches are the same as in fig .",
    "[ antif12 ] ( numerical solution of the nlies ) , while the right branches are given by the equations ( [ strong ] ) ( strong coupling expansions ) .",
    "as we stated at the end of previous subsection , left and right branches smoothly join .",
    "let us remark that it was quite unexpected to find the observed good agreement between the hubbard model and the bds ansatz predictions for such a small value of @xmath2 .",
    "it is also important to stress the crucial role played by the nlies in order to obtain the exact behaviour of the energy outside the perturbative domain .",
    "as shown in the study of the anomalous dimension of the konishi operator , the perturbation theory alone is not enough to reach an overlap with the strong coupling expansion .",
    "finally , we compared the hubbard and bds anomalous dimensions for @xmath329 in the range @xmath335 $ ] : as expected , the agreement between them is further enhanced and the two curves can be hardly distinguished , see fig .",
    "[ antif40 ] .",
    "the interesting feature of this case is that we were able to explicitly follow the evolution of the relative difference between hubbard and bds from weak to strong coupling .",
    "we observed that the two curves begin to separate at small @xmath12 , then they achieve a maximum in the relative difference , and after that they start to approach again .",
    "we think that such a pattern is valid at any @xmath2 , but the reduced numerical precision does not allow us to observe it for smaller values of @xmath2 .",
    "* remark*. the fact that @xmath336 at weak coupling , but @xmath337 at strong coupling suggests that the curves will cross at some intermediate value of @xmath12 .",
    "this is consistent with our numerical observation of the approaching of them as @xmath12 increases .",
    "unfortunately , the reduced precision of our data at large @xmath12 prevented us to observe such a crossing explicitly .",

    "[ relative ] on a log diagram : for large @xmath2 ( @xmath341 ) the behaviour is linear , meaning that the difference between the energies decays exponentially as the length @xmath2 is increased .",
    "this confirms our analytical findings of section  [ comparison ] . consistently with that section , we introduce the numerical rate of decay @xmath342 and write @xmath343 must hold and in this respect , table  [ tabella ] suggests that ( [ ineq ] ) is actually correct for the values of @xmath12 chosen .",

    "however , understanding how @xmath342 passes from the small coupling to the large coupling behaviour on the basis of numerical data seems difficult .",
    "indeed , the comparison of the two plots in fig .",
    "[ relative ] shows that the exponential behaviour in @xmath2 of @xmath346 is strongly dependent on the actual value of the coupling .",
    "in addition , it is clear that linearity ( i.e. exponential damping ) is reached at values of @xmath2 which rapidly increase with @xmath12 .",
    "the finite size correction @xmath10 is compared with the theoretical bds prediction ( [ fsc ] ) , represented with the dashed straight line . as observed in fig .",

    "[ relative ] , for higher values of @xmath12 linearity is reached at higher values of l.,title=\"fig : \" ]    finally , we remember , as pointed out before equation ( [ fsc ] ) , that the exponential damping of @xmath346 forces the equality of logarithmic - like and power - like finite size corrections in the hubbard and bds models . the most relevant case is the @xmath10 behaviour , that is explicitly plotted for the hubbard model in fig .",
    "[ unosul ] and compared with the analytical prediction ( [ fsc ] ) coming from the bds ansatz .",
    "in this paper we have derived the nlies describing the highest energy state of the half - filled ( attractive ) hubbard model with and without a suitable flux which is responsible for a precise contact with the highest possible anomalous dimension ( at fixed bare dimension @xmath2 ) . in particular , according to the important correspondence pioneered in @xcite , we computed the energy / anomalous dimension for this state / operator , and all the other conserved quantity eigenvalues may find an exact expression .",
    "the dimension is of course a function of the t hooft coupling @xmath3 ( and of the operator bare dimension @xmath2 ) , thanks to a duality connexion between this latter and the hubbard coupling .",

    "] of @xmath12 and @xmath2 . in this respect",
    ", we have been able to provide many plots showing clearly the dependence of the highest energy ( anomalous dimension ) on the coupling @xmath12 . in particular , we have concentrated ourselves on the comparison with the highest energy of the ( simpler ) bds model .",
    "we have shown , first analytically then numerically , that at large sizes ( @xmath311 ) , they coincide up to corrections exponentially small ( i.e. @xmath347 ) ) , i.e. of non - analytic form .",
    "of course , the finite size corrections are also important in the string theory since they come out as quantum loop corrections .",
    "as regards future perspectives , we would like to stress that the nlie approach is a very good and effective method to provide the observables dependence on the model parameters and size .",
    "one good quality is that the nlie can be written whenever the bethe ansatz equations are available , and even under more general circumstances , thanks to its equivalence to some functional equations .",
    "in particular the application of the nlie to the so - called string bethe ansatz @xcite and larger field sectors is particularly desirable , in view of tests of the ads / cft correspondence . for the time",
    "being , indeed , in spite of the progress following the discovery of integrability in both sides of the duality , such tests could be performed only for a limited number of cases , because of the technical difficulty in handling the bethe equations for general length and coupling . in the previous work @xcite and in the present one",
    "we have showed that by means of the nlie framework we are able to overcome this difficulty and provide exact analytic scaling with the length @xmath2 and the coupling @xmath3 ( and also numerical evaluation of the conformal dimensions ) .",
