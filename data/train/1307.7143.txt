    "this paper is part of a larger program to develop mathematical methods to quantitatively study performance of models for flocking .",
    "the main underlying motivation for the current work is to inform development of methods for programming driverless cars to enable coherent motion at high speed , even under dense traffic conditions .",
    "this is obviously an important problem , not only because it can lead to enormous cost savings to have smooth and dense traffic on our busier highways , but also because failures may cost lives .",
    "we study models that assume that each car is programmed identically and that can observe relative velocities and positions of nearby cars . in this work",
    "we take nearby to mean only the car in front and behind .",
    "however the methods we develop will be applicable to larger interactions ( and these will be explored in future work ) .",
    "we will assume that the system is linearized .",
    "various examples and analyses of nonlinear systems exist .",
    "but the emphasis here is on linear systems where we can allow for many parameters ( to take the neighbors into account ) and still perform a meaningful analysis .",
    "there are two main aspects in our analysis .",
    "the first is the asymptotic stability .",
    "this can be analyzed via the eigenvalues of the matrix associated with the first order differential equation .",
    "section [ chap : stability ] is devoted to establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for a class of systems to be asymptotically stable .",
    "even though this is a fairly straightforward calculation , we have not found it in this generality in the literature .",
    "the second , more delicate aspect of the problem is related to the fact that we may have arbitrarily many cars following each other , hundreds or even thousands . in this situation , even if all our systems are known to be asymptotically stable , transients may still grow exponentially in the number of cars . the spectrum of the linear operator does not help us to recognize this problem ( @xcite ) .",
    "a dramatic example of this can be found in @xcite where eigenvalues have real part bounded from above by a negative number and yet transients grow exponentially in @xmath4 .",
    "this kind of exponential growth underscores the need for different ( non - spectral ) methods to analyze these systems .",
    "the main result of our paper represents one such alternative approach .",
    "we establish that for the parameter values of interest ( e.g. asymptotically stable systems ) , solutions are well approximated by travelling wave signals with two distinct signal velocities , one positive ( in direction of increasing agent number ) and one negative .",
    "ever since the inception ( @xcite , @xcite ) of the subject , systems with periodic boundary conditions have been popular ( @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) because they tend to be easier to study .",
    "however the precise connection between these systems and more realistic systems with non - trivial boundary conditions has always been somewhat unclear .",
    "our current program differs from earlier work in two crucial ways .",
    "the first is that we make precise what the impact of our analysis is for the ( more realistic ) systems on the line : namely in this paper we derive an expression for the velocity with which disturbances propagate in systems with periodic boundary , and in @xcite we numerically verify that this holds on the line as well .",
    "the second is that we consider all possible nearest neighbor interactions : we do not impose symmetries .",
    "this turns out to be of the utmost importance : when we apply these ideas in @xcite it turns out that the systems with the best performance are asymmetric .",
    "asymmetric systems ( though not the same as ours ) have also been considered by @xcite and with similar results .",
    "however their methods are perturbative , and spectral based . in @xcite and @xcite asymmetric interactions are also studied , and it was shown that in certain cases they may lead to exponential growth ( in @xmath4 ) in the perturbation . in the later of these , the model is qualitatively different because absolute velocity feedback is assumed ( their method is also perturbative and not global ) .",
    "signal velocities were employed in earlier calculations namely @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these calculations have in common that they were done for _ car - following _ models .",
    "we are interested in a more general framework , namely where automated pilots may pay attention _ also _ to their neighbor _ behind _ them or indeed other cars further afield .",
    "our model is _ strictly decentralized_. there are two reasons to do that .",
    "first , in high speed , high / density traffic , small differences in measured absolute velocity may render that measurement useless , if not dangerous , for the feedback .",
    "secondly , the desired velocity , even on the highway , may not be constant .",
    "it will depend on weather , time of day , condition of the road , and so on .",
    "for these reasons we limit ourselves to strictly _ decentralized _ models that only use information relative to the observers in the cars ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "many authors study models featuring a term proportional to velocity minus desired velocity ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "we consider a model of a _ decentralized _ flock of @xmath4 moving agents ( e.g. cars ) , where each agent s acceleration depends linearly on on the differences between its own relative position and velocity , and those of some subset of neighbors .",
    "letting @xmath5 be the position of the @xmath6@xmath7agent , and @xmath8 its desired distance within the flock ( typically @xmath6 times a fixed spacing @xmath9 ) , the general linear decentralized flock satisfies @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the set of neighbors for agent @xmath6 , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the coefficients for how the difference of positions and velocities respectively between agent @xmath6 and @xmath14 affect the acceleration of agent @xmath6 .",
    "the above model is more general than that considered in this work , we restrict ourselves to a leaderless decentralized flock with identical agents and periodic boundary .",
    "these restrictions imply @xmath15 and @xmath16 depend only on @xmath17 , and that the neighborhood sets @xmath11 be shift invariant , e.g. @xmath18 .",
    "we will also restrict ourselves to nearest neighbor systems . to further simplify the resulting equations ,",
    "we introduce the change of variables @xmath19 ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "we also introduce constants @xmath20 and @xmath21 , define @xmath22 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 where all indices are treated mod @xmath4 , and define @xmath25 similarly",
    ". it will be convenient to allow negative indices for @xmath26 by setting @xmath27 , similarly for @xmath25 . in this notation ,",
    "the flock equations become the following :    [ defn : normalized system ] the system @xmath28 is given by the equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 the @xmath31 matrices @xmath32 and @xmath33 defined implicitly above are circulant matrices , as @xmath34 and @xmath35 depend only on @xmath36 .",
    "they also have row sums equal to 0 , as the decentralized condition has implied that @xmath37 we will accordingly refer to @xmath32 and @xmath33 as laplacian matrices .    * remark :* it is well known that circulant matrices have orthogonal eigenbases , and are diagonalized by the discrete fourier transform ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is the reason periodic boundary conditions are so convenient",
    ".    it will be useful to write the equations of @xmath28 as a first order system : @xmath38 this system has a 2-dimensional family of coherent solutions , namely : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are arbitrary elements of @xmath42 .",
    "these correspond to the generalized eigenspace of @xmath43 for the eigenvalue 0 .",
    "it is easy to see that all solutions converge to one of these coherent solutions if and only if all other eigenvalues of @xmath43 have negative real part . with a slight abuse of notation",
    "we will call this case asymptotically stable ( see @xcite for precise definitions ) :    the system in equation [ eqn : first - order ] is called asymptotically stable if it has a single eigenvalue equal to 0 with algebraic multiplicity 2 , and all other eigenvalues have strictly negative real parts .",
    "[ defn : asympt ]    the discrete fourier transform will play a fundamental role in our analysis .",
    "we define @xmath44 and @xmath44 as follows : denote @xmath45 and set @xmath46 denote the vector @xmath47 by : @xmath48 we furthermore define the moments of @xmath49 and @xmath50 : @xmath51 and observe that @xmath44 can be expanded as @xmath52 an analogous expansion for @xmath53 can also be given .",
    "in this section we state and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for nearest neighbor systems to be asymptotically stable .",

    "the eigenvalues of @xmath54 are @xmath44 with associated eigenvector @xmath47 ( where @xmath55 ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath53 and @xmath47 form eigenpairs for @xmath56 .

    "the eigenvectors of the @xmath57 matrix @xmath43 lie within @xmath4 two - dimensional subspaces which are orthogonal to each other .",
    "each of these may be spanned by two not necessarily orthogonal eigenvectors , or by an eigenvector and a ( jordan ) generalized eigenvector .",
