    "social - media activities often reflect phenomena that occur in other complex systems . by observing social networks and",
    "the content propagated through these networks , we can describe or even predict the interplay between the observed social - media activities and another complex system that is more difficult , if not impossible , to monitor .",
    "there are numerous studies reported in the literature that successfully correlate social - media activities to phenomena like election outcomes @xcite or stock - price movements @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the cohesion and coalitions exhibited by political groups in the eighth european parliament ( 20142019 ) .",
    "we analyze two entirely different aspects of how the members of the european parliament ( meps ) behave in policy - making processes . on one hand ,",
    "we analyze their co - voting patterns and , on the other , their retweeting ( i.e. , endorsing ) behavior .",
    "we use two diverse datasets in the analysis : the roll - call votes and the twitter data . a roll - call vote ( rcv )",
    "is a vote in the parliament in which the names of the meps are recorded along with their votes .",
    "the rcv data is available as part of the minutes of the parliament s plenary sessions . from this perspective",
    ", cohesion is seen as the tendency to co - vote ( i.e. , cast the same vote ) within a group , and a coalition is formed when members of two or more groups exhibit a high degree of co - voting on a subject .",
    "the second dataset comes from twitter .",
    "it captures the retweeting behavior of meps and implies cohesion ( retweets within the same group ) and coalitions ( retweets between the groups ) from a completely different perspective . with over 300 million monthly active users and 500 million tweets posted daily ,",
    "twitter is one of the most popular social networks .",
    "twitter allows its users to post short messages ( tweets ) and to follow other users . a user who follows",
    "another user is able to read his / her public tweets .",
    "twitter also supports other types of interaction , such as user mentions , replies , and retweets . of these , retweeting is the most important activity as it is used to share and endorse content created by other users .",
    "when a user retweets a tweet , the information about the original author as well as the tweet s content are preserved , and the tweet is shared with the user s followers . in general , users retweet content that they agree with and thus endorse the views expressed by the original tweeter .",
    "we apply two different methodologies to analyze the cohesion and coalitions . the first one is based on krippendorff s @xmath0 coefficient @xcite , which is a measure of the agreement among observers , raters , or measuring instruments assigning values to items or phenomena .",
    "the second one is based on exponential random graph models ( ergm ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the former , ergm is a network - based approach and is often used in social - network analyses .",
    "it can be employed to investigate to what degree certain factors , internal ( e.g. , node in- and out - degree ) or external ( e.g. , political group membership ) , govern the network - generation process . even though these two methodologies come with two different sets of techniques and",
    "are based on different assumptions , they provide consistent results .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are as follows :    \\(i ) we give general insights into the cohesion of political groups in the eighth european parliament , both overall and across different policy areas .",
    "\\(ii ) we explore whether coalitions are formed in the same way for different policy areas .",
    "\\(iii ) we explore to what degree the retweeting behavior of meps corresponds to their co - voting patterns .",
    "\\(iv ) we employ two statistically sound methodologies and examine the extent to which the results are sensitive to the choice of methodology .",
    "the most novel and interesting aspect of our work is the relationship between the co - voting and the retweeting patterns .",
    "the increased use of twitter by meps on days with a roll - call vote session ( see fig  [ fig : rcv_twitter_timeline ] ) is an indicator that these two processes are related .",
    "in addition , the force - based layouts of the co - voting network and the retweet network reveal a very similar structure on the left - to - center side of the political spectrum ( see fig  [ fig : covoting_retweeting_network ] ) .",
    "they also show a discrepancy on the far - right side of the spectrum , which calls for a more detailed analysis .",
    "in this paper we study and relate two very different aspects of how meps behave in policy - making processes .",
    "first , we look at their co - voting behavior , and second , we examine their retweeting patterns .",
    "thus , we draw related work from two different fields of science . on one hand , we look at how co - voting behavior is analyzed in the political - science literature and , on the other , we explore how twitter is used to better understand political and policy - making processes .",
    "the latter has been more thoroughly explored in the field of data mining ( specifically , text mining and network analysis ) .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first paper that studies legislative behavior in the eighth european parliament .",
    "the legislative behavior of the previous parliaments was thoroughly studied by hix , attina , and others @xcite .",
    "these studies found that voting behavior is determined to a large extent  and when viewed over time , increasingly so  by affiliation to a political group , as an organizational reflection of the ideological position .",
    "the authors found that the cohesion of political groups in the parliament has increased , while nationality has been less and less of a decisive factor @xcite .",
    "the literature also reports that a split into political camps on the left and right of the political spectrum has recently replaced the ` grand coalition ' between the two big blocks of christian conservatives ( _ epp _ ) and social democrats ( _ s&d _ ) as the dominant form of finding majorities in the parliament .",
    "the authors conclude that coalitions are to a large extent formed along the left - to - right axis @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the roll - call vote data published in the minutes of the parliament s plenary sessions . for a given subject",
    ", the data contains the vote of each mep present at the respective sitting .",
    "the roll - call vote data has already been extensively studied by other authors , most notably by hix et al .",
    "@xcite . to be able to study the cohesion and coalitions , authors like hix , attina , and rice @xcite defined and employed a variety of agreement measures .",
    "the most prominent measure is the agreement index proposed by hix et al.@xcite .",
    "this measure computes the agreement score from the size of the majority class for a particular vote .",
    "the agreement index , however , exhibits two drawbacks : ( i ) it does not account for co - voting by chance , and ( ii ) without a proper adaptation , it does not accommodate the scenario in which the agreement is to be measured between two different political groups .",
    "we employ two statistically sound methodologies developed in two different fields of science . the first one is based on krippendorff s @xmath0@xcite .",
    "@xmath0 is a measure of the agreement among observers , coders , or measuring instruments that assign values to items or phenomena .",
    "it compares the observed agreement to the agreement expected by chance .",
    "@xmath0 is used to measure the inter- and self - annotator agreement of human experts when labeling data , and the performance of classification models in machine - learning scenarios @xcite .",
    "in addition to @xmath0 , we employ exponential random graph models ( ergm ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the former , ergm is a network - based approach , often used in social - network analyses .",
    "ergm can be employed to investigate how different network statistics or external factors govern the network - formation process .",
    "the second important aspect of our study is related to analyzing the behavior of participants in social networks , specifically twitter .",
    "twitter is studied by researchers to better understand different political processes , and in some cases to predict their outcomes .",
    "eom et al .",
    "@xcite consider the number of tweets by a party as a proxy for the collective attention to the party , explore the dynamics of the volume , and show that this quantity contains information about an election s outcome .",
    "other studies @xcite reach similar conclusions .",
    "conover et al .",
    "@xcite predicted the political alignment of twitter users in the run - up to the 2010 us elections based on content and network structure .",
    "they analyzed the polarization of the retweet and mention networks for the same elections @xcite .",
    "borondo et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed user activity during the spanish presidential elections .",
    "they additionally analyzed the 2012 catalan elections , focusing on the interplay between the language and the community structure of the network @xcite .",
    "most existing research , as larsson points out @xcite , focuses on the online behavior of leading political figures during election campaigns .",
    "this paper continues our research on communities that meps ( and their followers ) form on twitter @xcite .",
    "the goal of our research was to evaluate the role of twitter in identifying communities of influence when the actual communities are known .",
    "we represent the influence on twitter by the number of retweets that meps `` receive '' .",
    "we construct two networks of influence : ( i ) core , which consists only of meps , and ( ii ) extended , which also involves their followers .",
    "we compare the detected communities in both networks to the groups formed by the political , country , and language membership of meps .",
    "the results show that the detected communities in the core network closely match the political groups , while the communities in the extended network correspond to the countries of residence .",
    "this provides empirical evidence that analyzing retweet networks can reveal real - world relationships and can be used to uncover hidden properties of the networks .",
    "lazer@xcite highlights the importance of network - based approaches in political science in general by arguing that politics is a relational phenomenon at its core .",
    "some researchers have adopted the network - based approach to investigate the structure of legislative work in the us congress , including committee and sub - committee membership @xcite , bill co - sponsoring @xcite , and roll - call votes @xcite . more recently ,",
    "dal maso et al .",
    "@xcite examined the community structure with respect to political coalitions and government structure in the italian parliament .",
    "scherpereel et al .",
    "@xcite examined the constituency , personal , and strategic characteristics of meps that influence their tweeting behavior .",
    "they suggested that twitter s characteristics , like immediacy , interactivity , spontaneity , personality , and informality , are likely to resonate with political parties across europe . by fitting regression models ,",
    "the authors find that meps from incohesive groups have a greater tendency to retweet .",
    "in contrast to most of these studies , we focus on the eighth european parliament , and more importantly , we study and relate two entirely different behavioral aspects , co - voting and retweeting .",
    "the goal of this research is to better understand the cohesion and coalition formation processes in the european parliament .",
    "in this section we provide an overview of the data and present the results on cohesion within and coalitions between the political groups in the european parliament .",
    "we collected the results of the roll - call votes ( rcvs ) from the website of the european parliament @xcite .",
    "the rcv data is available in the form of xmls . from the same website",
    ", we also obtained the register of active meps @xcite .",
    "this register , even though it is available as xml data , presents a challenge when integrated with the rcv documents .",
    "the reason lies in the ids of meps in the registry , which differ from the ids of the same meps in the rcv documents .",
    "we used a name - matching technique based on jaccard distance to establish the missing mappings .",
    "moreover , we linked each mep to her / his twitter i d and thus established an explicit link between the mep and her / his tweeting activities .",
    "the european parliament consists of 751 members . within the period of our study , from october 1 , 2014 to february 29 , 2016",
    ", 36 meps left the european parliament and were substituted by 36 new meps .",
    "this gives a total of 787 meps that participated in the work of the parliament during this period . in total ,",
    "79% of the meps have twitter accounts and 67% have retweeted or been retweeted by another mep .",
    "the distribution of meps by political groups , with their twitter accounts , and retweeting activity is given in table  [ tab : groups_members ] .",
    ".*distribution of members of the european parliament ( meps ) by political groups .",

    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     the retweet network of the parliament consists of 530 nodes corresponding to the meps that are active on twitter , and 4723 edges corresponding to the pairs of meps who have retweeted each other .",
    "the weight of the link between two meps represents the number of times these meps have retweeted each other .",
    "the total weight of edges in the network , corresponding to the total number of retweets between the meps , is 26133 .      in this section",
    "we first analyze the level of cohesion of the european parliament s groups by looking at co - voting as an agreement and network formation .",
    "next , we explore two important policy areas , namely _ economic and monetary system _ and _ state and evolution of the union_. finally , we analyze the cohesion of the european parliament s groups on twitter .      existing research by hix et al .",
    "@xcite shows that the cohesion of the european political groups has been rising since the 1990s , and the level of cohesion remained high even after the eu s enlargement in 2004 , when the number of meps increased from 626 to 732 .",

    "the _ greens - efa _ have the highest cohesion of all groups .",
    "this finding is in line with an analysis of previous compositions of the fifth and sixth european parliaments by hix and noury @xcite , and the seventh by votewatch @xcite .",
    "they are closely followed by the _",

    "they also reported a slightly less cohesive _ epp - ed_. this group split in 2009 into _ epp _ and _ ecr_. votewatch reports _ epp _ to have cohesion on a par with _ greens - efa _ and _ s&d _ in the seventh european parliament .",
    "the cohesion level we observe in the current european parliament is also similar to the level of _ greens - efa _ and _",
    "s&d_.    the catch - all group of the non - aligned ( _ ni _ ) comes out as the group with the lowest cohesion .",
    "in addition , among the least cohesive groups in the european parliament are the eurosceptics _ efdd _ , which include the british _ ukip _ led by nigel farage , and the _ enl _ whose largest party are the french _ national front _ , led by marine le pen .",
    "similarly , hix and noury found that the least cohesive groups in the seventh european parliament are the nationalists and eurosceptics .",

    "the details of building the model are given in the `` '' section .",
    "the cohesion results obtained with ergm are comparable to the results based on agreement . in this context , the parameters estimated by the ergm refer to the matching of meps who belong to the same political group ( one parameter per group ) .",
    "the parameters measure the homophilous matching between meps who have the same political affiliation .",
    "a positive value for the estimated parameter indicates that the co - voting of meps from that group is greater than what is expected by chance , where the expected number of co - voting links by chance in a group is taken to be uniformly random .",
    "a negative value indicates that there are fewer co - voting links within a group than expected by chance .",
    "even though @xmath0 and ergm compute scores relative to what is expected by chance , they refer to different interpretations of chance .",

    "we observe the same situation as with @xmath0 .",
    "the non - aligned members _ ni _ have the lowest cohesion , followed by _ efdd _ and _",
    "enl_.    the only place where the two methods disagree is the level of cohesion of _ gue - ngl_. the _ alpha _ attributes _ gue - ngl _ a rather high level of cohesion , on a par with _ alde _ , whereas the ergm attributes them a much lower cohesion .",
    "this is the only discrepancy between the two methods , and we do not investigate it further .",
    "in addition to the overall cohesion , we also focus on two selected policy areas .",
    "a detailed description of all the areas is in the `` '' section .",
    "the cohesion of the political groups related to these two policy areas is shown in the first two panels in fig  [ fig : cohesion_party_alpha ] ( @xmath0 ) and fig  [ fig : cohesion_party_ergm ] ( ergm ) .",
    "the most important observation is that the level of cohesion of the political groups is very stable across different policy areas .",
    "these results are corroborated by both methodologies .",
    "similar to the overall cohesion , the most cohesive political groups are the _ s&d _ , _ greens - efa _ , and _",
    "epp_. the least cohesive group is the _ ni _ , followed by the _ enl _ and _ efdd_. the two methodologies agree on the level of cohesion for all the political groups , except for _ gue - ngl_.      we determine the cohesion of political groups on twitter by using the average number of retweets between meps within the same group .",
    "the results are shown in fig  [ fig : cohesion_twitter ] .",
    "the right - wing _ enl _ and _ efdd _ come out as the most cohesive groups , with an average of over 230 retweets .",
    "all the other groups have a far lower average number of retweets , in the range between 46 and 91 .",
    "meps from _ enl _ and _ efdd _ post by far the largest number of retweets ( over 240 ) , and at the same time over 94% of their retweets are directed to meps from the same group . moreover",
    ", these two groups stand out in the way the retweets are distributed within the group . a large portion of the retweets of _ efdd _ ( 1755 )",
    "go to nigel farage , the leader of the group .",
    "likewise , a very large portion of retweets of _ enl _ ( 2324 ) go to marine le pen , the leader of the group .",
    "farage and le pen are by far the two most retweeted meps , with the third one having 666 retweets",
    ".        these results are in contrast to the observed voting cohesion of the political groups .",
    "when it comes to voting , these groups are , after _ ni _ , the least cohesive groups .",
    "this shows that these groups do not have a unifying platform across all policy areas , which is reflected in their low voting cohesion , but they clearly have a set of issues on which they have common opinion and they pursue these issues on social media .",
    "coalition formation in the european parliament is largely determined by ideological positions , reflected in the degree of cooperation of parties at the national and european levels .",
    "the observation of ideological inclinations in the coalition formation within the european parliament was already made by other authors @xcite and is confirmed in this study .",
    "the basic patterns of coalition formation in the european parliament can already be seen in the co - voting network in fig  [ fig : covoting_retweeting_network]a .",
    "it is remarkable that the degree of attachment between the european political groups , which indicates the degree of cooperation in the european parliament , nearly exactly corresponds to the seating order . in line with western parliamentary traditions , political groups in the european parliament",
    "are seated from the nordic greens ( _ gue - ngl _ ) and the social democrats ( _ s&d _ ) on the left , to the conservative and right - wing populist groups ( _ epp _ , _ ecr _ , _ efdd _ , _ enl _ , and _ ni _ ) on the right .",
    "looking at the degree of cooperation between the different groups , the liberal _ alde _ seems to have an intermediator role between the left and right parts of the spectrum in the parliament . between the extreme",
    "( _ gue - ngl _ ) and center left ( _ s&d _ ) groups , this function seems to be occupied by the european green party ( _ greens - efa _ ) .",
    "the non - aligned members of the european parliament , as well as the eurosceptic _ effd _ and _ enl _ , seem to alternately tip the balance on both poles of the political spectrum .",
    "being ideologically more inclined to vote with other conservative and right - wing groups ( _ epp _ , _ ecr _ ) , they sometimes also cooperate with the extreme left - wing group ( _ gue - ngl _ ) with which they share their euroscepticism as a common denominator .",
    "figs [ fig : coalition_overall_ka ] and [ fig : coalition_overall_ergm ] give a more detailed understanding of the coalition formation in the european parliament .",
    "fig [ fig : coalition_overall_ka ] displays the degree of agreement or cooperation between political groups measured by krippendorff s @xmath0 , whereas fig [ fig : coalition_overall_ergm ] is based on the result from the ergm .",
    "we first focus on the overall results displayed in the right - hand plots of figs [ fig : coalition_overall_ka ] and [ fig : coalition_overall_ergm ] .",
    "the strongest degrees of cooperation are observed , with both methods , between the two major parties ( _ epp _ and _ s&d _ ) on the one hand , and the liberal _ alde _ on the other .",
    "furthermore , we see a strong propensity for the greens to vote with the social democrats ( 5th strongest coalition by @xmath0 , and 3rd by ergm ) and the nordic greens ( _ gue - ngl _ ) ( 3rd strongest coalition by @xmath0 , and 5th by ergm ) . these results underline the role of _ alde _ and _ greens - efa _ as intermediaries for the larger groups to achieve a majority .",
    "although the two largest groups together have 405 seats and thus significantly more than the 376 votes needed for a simple majority , the degree of cooperation between the two major groups is ranked only as the fourth strongest by both methods .",
    "this suggests that these two political groups find it easier to negotiate deals with smaller counterparts than with the other large group .",
    "this observation was also made by hix et al .",
    "@xcite , who noted that alignments on the left and right of the political spectrum have in recent years replaced the `` grand coalition '' between the two large blocks of christian conservatives ( _ epp _ ) and social democrats ( _ s&d _ ) as the dominant form of finding majorities in the parliament .    .",
    "* , width=642 ]      next , we focus on the coalition formation within the two selected policy areas .",
    "the area _ state and evolution of the union _ is dominated by cooperation between the two major groups , _",
    "s&d _ and _ epp _ , as well as _",
    "furthermore , we observe a high degree of cooperation between groups that are generally regarded as integration friendly , like _ greens - efa _ and _ gue - ngl_. we also see , particularly in fig  [ fig : coalition_overall_ka ] , a relatively high degree of cooperation between groups considered as eurosceptic , like _ ecr _ , _ effd _ , _ enl _ , and the group of non - aligned members .",
    "the dichotomy between supporters and opponents of european integration is even more pronounced within the policy area _",
    "economic and monetary system_. in fact , we are taking a closer look specifically at these two areas as they are , at the same time , both controversial and of high significance .",
    "our results reflect how contentious this area is .",
    "again , both methods rank the cooperation between _",
    "s&d _ and _ epp _ on the one hand , and _ alde _ on the other , as the strongest .",
    "we also observe a certain degree of unanimity among the eurosceptic and right - wing groups ( _ efdd _ , _ enl _ , and _ ni _ ) in this policy area .",
    "this seems plausible , as these groups were ( especially in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and the subsequent european debt crisis ) in fierce opposition to further payments to financially troubled member states .",
    "however , we also observe a number of strong coalitions that might , at first glance , seem unusual , specifically involving the left - wing group _ gue - ngl _ on the one hand , and the right - wing _ efdd _ , _ enl _ , and _ ni _ on the other .",
    "these links also show up in the network plot in fig  [ fig : covoting_retweeting_network]a . this might be attributable to a certain degree of euroscepticism on both sides : rooted in criticism of capitalism on the left , and at least partly a _",
    "raison dtre _ on the right .",
    "hix et al .",
    "@xcite discovered this pattern as well , and proposed an additional explanation ",
    "these coalitions also relate to a form of government - opposition dynamic that is rooted at the national level , but is reflected in voting patterns at the european level .",
    "the first insight into coalition formation on twitter can be observed in the retweet network in fig  [ fig : covoting_retweeting_network]b .",
    "the ideological left to right alignment of the political groups is reflected in the retweet network .",
    "fig  [ fig : twitter_inter ] shows the strength of the coalitions on twitter , as estimated by the number of retweets between meps from different groups .",
    "the strongest coalitions are formed between the right - wing groups _ efdd _ and _ ecr _ , as well as _",
    "enl _ and _ ni_. at first , this might come as a surprise , since these groups do not form strong coalitions in the european parliament , as can be seen in figs  [ fig : coalition_overall_ka ] and [ fig : coalition_overall_ergm ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the meps from these groups are very active twitter users .",
    "as previously stated , meps from _ enl _ and _ efdd _ post the largest number of retweets . moreover , 63% of the retweets outside of _ enl _ are retweets of _",
    "ni_. this effect is even more pronounced with meps from _ efdd _ , whose retweets of _ ecr _ account for 74% of their retweets from other groups .",
    "in addition to these strong coalitions on the right wing , we find coalition patterns to be very similar to the voting coalitions observed in the european parliament , seen in figs  [ fig : coalition_overall_ka ] and [ fig : coalition_overall_ergm ] .",
    "the strongest coalitions , which come immediately after the right - wing coalitions , are between _ greens - efa _ on the one hand , and _ gue - ngl _ and _ s&d _ on the other , as well as _",
    "alde _ on the one hand , and _ epp _ and _ s&d _ on the other .",
    "these results corroborate the role of _ alde _ and _ greens - efa _ as intermediaries in the european parliament , not only in the legislative process , but also in the debate on social media .",

    ", however , where we observe a far - left and far - right cooperation , where the division is along the traditional left - right axis .",
    "the patterns of coalitions forming on twitter closely resemble those in the european parliament . in fig",
    "[ fig : rcv_twitter_blocks]j we see that the strongest degrees of cooperation on twitter are within the groups .",
    "the only group with low cohesion is the _ ni _ , whose members have only seven retweets between them .",
    "the coalitions on twitter follow the seating order in the european parliament remarkably well , fig  [ fig : rcv_twitter_blocks]k .",
    "what is striking is that the same blocks form on the left , center , and on the center - right , both in the european parliament and on twitter .",
    "the biggest difference between the coalitions in the european parliament and on twitter is on the far - right , where we observe _ enl _ and _ ni _ as isolated blocks .",
    "the results shown in fig  [ fig : twitter_ergm ] quantify the extent to which communication in one social context ( twitter ) can explain cooperation in another social context ( co - voting in the european parliament ) .",
    "a positive value indicates that the matching behavior in the retweet network is similar to the one in the co - voting network , specific for an individual policy area . on the other hand",
    ", a negative value implies a negative `` correlation '' between the retweeting and co - voting of meps in the two different contexts .",
    "the bars in fig  [ fig : twitter_ergm ] correspond to the coefficients from the edge covariate terms of the ergm , describing the relationship between the retweeting and co - voting behavior of meps .",
    "the coefficients are aggregated for individual policy areas by means of a meta - analysis .",
    "a detailed description of the methodology is in the section `` '' .",
    "overall , we observe a positive correlation between retweeting and co - voting , which is significantly different from zero .",
    "the strongest positive correlations are in the areas _ area of freedom , security and justice _ , _ external relations of the union _ , and _ internal markets_. weaker , but still positive , correlations are observed in the areas _ economic , social and territorial cohesion _ , _",
    "european citizenship _ , and _ state and evolution of the union_. the only exception , with a significantly negative coefficient , is the area _ economic and monetary system_. this implies that in the area _ economic and monetary system _ we observe a significant deviation from the usual co - voting patterns . recalling the results from section `` '' , we see that this is indeed the case . especially noteworthy",
    "are the coalitions between _ gue - ngl _ and _ greens - efa _ on the left wing , and _ efdd _ and _ enl _ on the right wing . in the section `` ''",
    "we interpret these results as a combination of euroscepticism on both sides , motivated on the left by a skeptical attitude towards the market orientation of the eu , and on the right by a reluctance to give up national sovereignty .",
    "we study cohesion and coalitions in the eighth european parliament by analyzing , on one hand , meps co - voting tendencies and , on the other , their retweeting behavior .",
    "we reveal that the most cohesive political group in the european parliament , when it comes to co - voting , is _ greens - efa _ , closely followed by _",
    "s&d _ and _ epp_. this is consistent with what votewatch @xcite reported for the seventh european parliament .",
    "the non - aligned ( _ ni _ ) come out as the least cohesive group , followed by the eurosceptic _",
    "efdd_. hix and noury @xcite also report that nationalists and eurosceptics form the least cohesive groups in the sixth european parliament .",
    "we reaffirm most of these results with both of the two employed methodologies .",
    "the only point where the two methodologies disagree is in the level of cohesion for the left - wing _ gue - ngl _ , which is portrayed by ergm as a much less cohesive group .",
    "the reason for this needs to be further investigated .",
    "the level of cohesion of the political groups is quite stable across different policy areas and similar conclusions apply .",
    "on twitter we can see results that are consistent with the rcv results for the left - to - center political spectrum .",
    "the exception , which clearly stands out , is the right - wing groups _ enl _ and _ efdd _ that seem to be the most cohesive ones .",
    "this is the direct opposite of what was observed in the rcv data .",
    "we speculate that this phenomenon is the result of a well - designed propaganda apparatus that the right - wing leaders ( nigel farage and marine le pen ) put in place to spread their anti - eu messages across social media .",
    "we observed the same phenomenon recently during the brexit campaign @xcite .",
    "we speculate that brexit was `` won '' to some extent due to this apparatus , which is practically non - existent among the pro - eu political groups .",
    "the fact that _ enl _ and _ efdd _ are the least cohesive groups in the european parliament can be attributed to their political focus .",
    "it seems more important for the group to agree on its anti - eu stance and to call for independence and sovereignty , and much less important to agree on other issues put forward in the parliament .    the basic pattern of coalition formation , with respect to co - voting ,",
    "can already be seen in fig  [ fig : covoting_retweeting_network]a : the force - based layout almost completely corresponds to the seating order in the european parliament ( from the left- to the right - wing groups ) .",
    "a more thorough examination shows that the strongest cooperation can be observed , for both methodologies , between _ epp _ , _ s&d _ , and _ alde _ , where _ epp _ and _ s&d _ are the two largest groups , while the liberal _ alde _ plays the role of an intermediary in this context . on the other hand , the role of an intermediary between the far - left _ gue - ngl _ and its center - left neighbor , _ s&d _",
    ", is played by the european green party ( _ greens - efa _ ) .",
    "these three parties also form a strong coalition in the european parliament . on the far right of the spectrum ,",
    "the non - aligned , _ efdd _ , and _ enl _ form another coalition .",
    "this behavior was also observed by hix et al .",
    "@xcite , stating that alignments on the left and right have in recent years replaced the `` grand coalition '' between the two large blocks of christian conservatives ( _ epp _ ) and social democrats ( _ s&d _ ) as the dominant form of finding majorities in the european parliament . when looking at the policy area _",
    "economic and monetary system _ , we see the same coalitions .",
    "however , interestingly , _ efdd _ , _ enl _ , and _ ni _ often co - vote with the far - left _ gue - ngl_. this can be attributed to a certain degree of euroscepticism on both sides : as a criticism of capitalism , on one hand , and as the main political agenda , on the other .",
    "this pattern was also discovered by hix et al .",
    "@xcite , who argued that these coalitions emerge from a form of government - opposition dynamics , rooted at the national level , but also reflected at the european level .",
    "when studying coalitions on twitter , the strongest coalitions can be observed on the right of the spectrum ( between _ efdd _ , _ ecr _ , _ enl _ , and _ ni _ ) .",
    "this is , yet again , in contrast to what was observed in the rcv data .",
    "the reason lies in the anti - eu messages they tend to collectively spread ( retweet ) across the network",
    ". this behavior forms strong retweet ties , not only within , but also between , these groups .",
    "for example , meps of _ efdd _ mainly retweet meps from _ ecr _ ( with the exception of meps from their own group ) .",
    "in contrast to these right - wing coalitions , we find the other coalitions to be consistent with what is observed in the rcv data .",
    "the strongest coalitions on the left - to - center part of the axis are those between _ gue - ngl _ , _ greens - efa _ , and _",
    "s&d _ , and between _ s&d _ , _ alde _ , and _",
    "epp_. these results reaffirm the role of _ greens - efa _ and _ alde _ as intermediaries , not only in the european parliament but also in the debates on social media .",
    "last , but not least , with the ergm methodology we measure the extent to which the retweet network can explain the co - voting activities in the european parliament .",
    "we compute this for each policy area separately and also over all rcvs .",
    "we conclude that the retweet network indeed matches the co - voting behavior , with the exception of one specific policy area . in the area _ economic and monetary system _ ,",
    "the links in the ( overall ) retweet network do not match the links in the co - voting network .",
    "moreover , the negative coefficients imply a radically different formation of coalitions in the european parliament .",
    "this is consistent with our results in figs  [ fig : coalition_overall_ka ] and [ fig : coalition_overall_ergm ] , and is also observed in fig  [ fig : rcv_twitter_blocks ] . from these figures",
    "we see that in this particular case , the coalitions are also formed between the right - wing groups and the far - left gue - ngl .",

    "it also comprises the relationship to the european central bank ( which is accountable to the european parliament ) .    * economic , social and territorial cohesion : *",
    "questions with regard to employment and social , but also infrastructural policies , which should promote the economic , social and territorial cohesion of the eu are covered by this policy area .    *",
    "european citizenship : * concerns matters of citizenship , migration and asylum .    *",
    "external relations of the union : * covers policies regulating the relationship of the eu with third countries",
    ". decisions concerning the accession process to the eu , associations , and the european neighbourhood policy fall in this category .",
    "security , defence , development policy , and human - rights matters are in also this policy area .",
    "* internal market : * this policy area deals with internal market regulations , competition and consumer rights",
    ". it also covers standards for products , public subsidies and the mutual recognition of degrees and qualifications .    *",
    "state and evolution of the union : * this policy area covers seminal decisions with regard to the european integration process and concerns the power balance between the eu institutions on the one side and the member states on the other side .      in this section we show how the co - voting behaviour of meps can be quantified by a measure of the agreement between them .",
    "we treat individual rcvs as observations , and meps as independent observers or raters .",
    "when they cast the same vote , there is a high level of agreement , and when they vote differently , there is a high level of disagreement .",
    "we define cohesion as the level of agreement within a political group , a coalition as a voting agreement between political groups , and opposition as a disagreement between different groups .",
    "there are many well - known measures of agreement in the literature .",
    "we selected krippendorff s alpha - reliability ( @xmath0 ) @xcite , which is a generalization of several specialized measures .",
    "it works for any number of observers , and is applicable to different variable types and metrics ( e.g. , nominal , ordered , interval , etc . ) .",
    "in general , @xmath0 is defined as follows : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the actual disagreement between observers ( meps ) , and @xmath12 is disagreement expected by chance . when observers agree perfectly , @xmath0@xmath13 , when the agreement equals the agreement by chance , @xmath0@xmath14 , and when the observers disagree systematically , @xmath0@xmath15 .",
    "the two disagreement measures are defined as follows : @xmath16 @xmath17 the arguments @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are defined below and refer to the values in the coincidence matrix that is constructed from the rcvs data . in roll - call votes , @xmath20 ( and @xmath21 ) is a nominal variable with two possible values : _ yes _ and _",
    "no_. @xmath22 is a difference function between the values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , defined as : @xmath23    the rcvs data has the form of a reliability data matrix : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number of rcvs , @xmath26 is the number of meps , @xmath27 is the number of votes cast in the voting @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the actual vote of an mep @xmath30 in voting @xmath28 ( _ yes _ or _ no _ ) .",
    "a coincidence matrix is constructed from the reliability data matrix , and is in general a @xmath31-by-@xmath31 square matrix , where @xmath31 is the number of possible values of @xmath20 . in our case , where only _ yes / no _ votes are relevant , the coincidence matrix is a @xmath32-by-@xmath32 matrix of the following form : @xmath33 a cell @xmath34 accounts for all coincidences from all pairs of meps in all rcvs where one mep has voted @xmath20 and the other @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath19 are the totals for each vote outcome , and @xmath36 is the grand total .",

    "the coincidence matrix is therefore symmetrical around the diagonal , and the diagonal contains all the equal votes .",
    "the @xmath0 agreement is used to measure the agreement between two meps or within a group of meps . when applied to a political group",
    ", @xmath0 corresponds to the cohesion of the group .",
    "the closer @xmath0 is to 1 , the higher the agreement of the meps in the group , and hence the higher the cohesion of the group .",
    "we propose a modified version of @xmath0 to measure the agreement between two different groups , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in the case of a voting agreement between political groups ,",
    "high @xmath0 is interpreted as a coalition between the groups , whereas negative @xmath0 indicates political opposition .",
    "suppose @xmath41 and @xmath42 are disjoint subsets of all the meps , @xmath43 .",
    "the respective number of votes cast by both group members in vote @xmath28 is @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the coincidences are then computed as : @xmath46 where the @xmath39 pairs come from different groups , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . the total number of such pairs in vote @xmath28 is @xmath47 .",
    "the actual number @xmath38 of the pairs is multiplied by @xmath48 so that the total contribution of vote @xmath28 to the coincidence matrix is @xmath49 .      in this section",
    "we describe a network - based approach to analyzing the co - voting behavior of meps .",
    "the nodes in the network are meps , and an undirected edge between two meps is formed when they cast the same vote in a roll - call vote .",
    "we are interested in the factors that determine the coalition formation within the european parliament as well as the cohesion within political groups .",
    "furthermore , we investigate to what extent communication in a different social context , i.e. , the retweeting behavior of meps , can explain the co - voting of meps .",
    "for this purpose we apply an exponential random graph model @xcite to individual roll - call vote networks , and aggregate the results by means of the meta - analysis .",
    "ergms allow us to investigate the factors relevant for the network - formation process .",
    "network metrics , as described in the abundant literature , serve to gain information about the structural properties of the observed network .",
    "a model investigating the processes driving the network formation , however , has to take into account that there can be a multitude of alternative networks . if we are interested in the parameters influencing the network formation we have to consider all possible networks and measure their similarity to the originally observed networks .",
    "the family if ergms builds upon this idea .    assume a random graph @xmath50 made up of a set of @xmath25 nodes and @xmath51 edges @xmath52 where , similar to a binary choice model , @xmath53 if the nodes @xmath54 are connected and @xmath55 if not . since the network data is by definition relational and thus violates assumptions of independence , classical binary choice models can not be applied in this context . within an ergm , the given network is modelled by @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the vectors of parameters and network statistics , respectively , and @xmath59 is a normalizing constant corresponding to all possible networks .",
    "evaluating the above expression allows us to make assertions if and how specific nodal attributes influence the network - formation process .",
    "these nodal attributes can be endogenous ( dyad - dependent parameters ) to the network , like the in- and out - degrees of a node , or exogenous ( dyad - independent parameters ) , as the party affiliation , or the country of origin , in the case of the co - voting network in the european parliament .",
    "since the number of possible outcomes vastly exceeds the number of constraining parameters , the evaluation of the objective function is usually done by gibbs sampling @xcite . in our study",
    "we used the `` ergm '' library from the statistical software package r @xcite .",
    "considering the number of roll - call votes , it seems straightforward to interpret the different roll - call vote networks as multiplex networks and collapse them into one weighted network .",
    "this could then be analyzed by an ergm adapted for valued networks @xcite .",
    "however , there are two reasons to choose a different approach . first , aggregating the roll - call vote data results into an extremely dense network , leading to severe convergence problems for the ergm .",
    "second , the roll - call vote data contains information about the different policy areas the individual votes were about .",
    "since we are interested in how the coalition formation in the european parliament differs over different areas , a method is needed that allows for an ex - post analysis of the corresponding results .",

    "we measure the cohesion of a political group @xmath41 as the average retweets , i.e. , the ratio of the number of retweets between the meps in the group @xmath68 to the number of meps in the group @xmath69 . the higher the ratio , the more each mep ( on average ) retweets the meps from the same political group , hence , the higher the cohesion of the political group .",

    "<S> we study the cohesion within and the coalitions between political groups in the eighth european parliament ( 20142019 ) by analyzing two entirely different aspects of the behavior of the members of the european parliament ( meps ) in the policy - making processes . </S>",
    "<S> on one hand , we analyze their co - voting patterns and , on the other , their retweeting behavior . </S>",
    "<S> we make use of two diverse datasets in the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is the roll - call vote dataset , where cohesion is regarded as the tendency to co - vote within a group , and a coalition is formed when the members of several groups exhibit a high degree of co - voting agreement on a subject . </S>",
    "<S> the second dataset comes from twitter ; it captures the retweeting ( i.e. , endorsing ) behavior of the meps and implies cohesion ( retweets within the same group ) and coalitions ( retweets between groups ) from a completely different perspective .    </S>",
    "<S> we employ two different methodologies to analyze the cohesion and coalitions . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is based on krippendorff s alpha reliability , used to measure the agreement between raters in data - analysis scenarios , and the second one is based on exponential random graph models , often used in social - network analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we give general insights into the cohesion of political groups in the european parliament , explore whether coalitions are formed in the same way for different policy areas , and examine to what degree the retweeting behavior of meps corresponds to their co - voting patterns . </S>",
    "<S> a novel and interesting aspect of our work is the relationship between the co - voting and retweeting patterns . </S>"
