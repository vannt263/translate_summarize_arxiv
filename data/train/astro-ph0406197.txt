    "the formation of molecular hydrogen plays a key role in star formation on all scales .",
    "we have learned over the last two decades that the interactions between atomic clouds and snrs and/or stellar winds can provide a mechanism by which molecules can form ( elmegreen 1993 ) .",
    "furthermore , observations of atomic hydrogen in our milky way and nearby galaxies reveal the ubiquity of shells and supershells in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , indicating a potential origin for the substantial molecular material found in the interstellar medium .",
    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) presents us with a unique opportunity to study the interaction of massive stars and their interstellar environment that perfectly illustrated by the spitzer early release observations of 30 doradus in the lmc ( brandl et al .",
    "first , the stars in the lmc are at a common distance and are close enough that individual stars and their stellar ejecta can be studied in great detail .",
    "second , the lmc is inclined at only 27 degrees to the line of sight , so that the 3-d structure of mass - loss bubbles can be mapped without problems of confusion , and third , the reddening is low in virtually all fields .",
    "therefore , the lmc provides an excellent opportunity to study the effects of different levels of uv radiation from stars on their environments in the multi - phase ism , and allows us to apply our understanding of the interstellar properties to studies of the early evolution of high redshift and metal poor galaxies .    at a distance of 55 kpc ( feast 1991 )",
    ", the lmc can be mapped with a high spatial resolution at high excitation co lines by the antarctic submillimeter telescope and remote observatory ( ast / ro ) .",

    "( 2000 ) elucidated the condition of atomic and molecular medium in the early stages of star formation in this low metallicity system .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratios are lower than those in the milky way , so uv radiation can penetrate deeper into the clouds and dissociate more co molecules to greater depths in the lmc ( pak et al .",

    ", the @xmath0co @xmath1 emission traces the warm and dense molecular gas where collisional de - excitation balances radiative de - excitation ( spitzer 1978 ; hollenbach & tielens 1999 ) .",
    "this usually occurs when the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) photons from stars photodissociate the molecular cloud ( tielens & hollenbach 1985 ; sternberg & dalgarno 1989 ; wolfire , tielens , & hollenbach 1990 ; hollenbach & tielens 1990 ) .",
    "the @xmath0co @xmath1 emitting molecular cloud associated with the n44 complex is a fine example of a photodissociated region ( pdr ) in the lmc .",

    "using our newly observed line ratios of @xmath0co @xmath1 and [ ci ] emission , the pdr model allows us to estimate the cloud density , kinetic temperature , and the fuv fluxes of the gas ( tielens & hollenbach 1985 ; sternberg & dalgarno 1989 ; wolfire , tielens , & hollenbach 1990 ; sternberg & dalgarno 1995 ; kaufman et al .",

    "it is not surprising to find such a high density of hydrogen molecules in the region associated with n44 bc , where we detect the strong @xmath0co @xmath1 emission .",

    "in addition , the present study has shown the extent of the dense gas as well as its location .",
    "a previous study by chin et al . ( 1997 ) derived the molecular mass of n44 bc where we detect strong co @xmath1 emission , to be about 10@xmath60 @xmath66 using the virial theorem .",
    "if we estimate the molecular mass in the shell simply by @xmath67 and by adopting a deprojected size of the co @xmath1 emitting cloud , @xmath68 , of about 22.7 pc , then we find that the mass of molecular gas associated with n44 bc may be at least an order of magnitude greater than the mass derived by the virial theorem .",
    "as clearly seen in figure 3 , there is a high - velocity component of co @xmath1 emission at @xmath34=304 km  s@xmath18  arising from the molecular cloud which is associated with expanding hi and h@xmath23 shells ( meaburn & laspias 1991 ; magnier et al . 1996",

    "the brightness temperature of the high - velocity gas , @xmath33 is about 0.1 k. this faint emission is probably the receding side of accelerated material with an expansion velocity of @xmath69 km  s@xmath18  . in this scenario ,",
    "the high - velocity gas is presumed to be caused by the interaction of the molecular cloud with the stellar winds and/or supernovae blasts of the hot stars in lh 47 ( lucke & hodge 1970 ; oey & massey 1995 ) . the expansion pattern of the hi gas shell surrounding lh 47 is similar to that of the ionized gas shell of shell 1 ( kim et al .",
    "the present study shows that the acceleration of the co @xmath70 emitting gas is only slightly smaller than the expansion velocity of the hi  gas , which is about 30 km  s@xmath18  .",
    "we therefore expect that this high - velocity gas in the co @xmath70 emission is associated with the expanding atomic and ionized gas shells in the n44 complex . however , it is also conceivable that the hii region , n44 bc , has driven a shock into the molecular cloud and produced such high - velocity molecular gas .",
    "we estimate an upper limit on the kinetic energy of the high - velocity molecular cloud of @xmath71 ergs . assuming that this high - velocity molecular cloud is produced by an outward transfer of momentum from the expanding hi and hii shells , we calculate an upper limit on the total kinetic energy of the shell of 2.9 @xmath38 @xmath72 ergs . we have summed the kinetic energy in the ionized gas shell and in the hi  shell for the superbubble shell  1 in n44 ( kim et al .",
    "1998a ) , and the upper limit of the kinetic energy of the high - velocity molecular cloud in n44 .",
    "adopting the thermal energy of shell 1 ( chu & mac low 1990 ; magnier et al .",
    "1996 ; kim et al .",
    "1998a ) , we find that the sum of the total kinetic energy of the shell and its thermal energy is similar to the energy released by stellar winds and supernovae explosions using weaver et al.s ( 1977 ) pressure - driven bubble model .",

    "<S> we detected strong @xmath0co @xmath1 emission toward the hii region called as n44bc , which is located on the rim of an expanding giant shell in the n44 region . </S>",

    "<S> we also note that there is a high - velocity component associated with the @xmath0co @xmath1 emission . </S>",
    "<S> this probably originates from molecular material accelerated as a result of the motion induced by the expanding giant shell surrounding lh47 in the n44 complex . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the kinetic energy of this high - velocity gas observed in the co @xmath1 emission toward the rim of the expanding hii shell is at least an order of magnitude higher than the kinetic energy derived for the hi and hii gas in this region . </S>"
