    "galaxy evolution depends strongly on the environment . in particular",
    ", galaxy - galaxy interactions can induce nuclear activity by removing angular momentum from the gas and , in this way , feeding the central black hole .",
    "hence , a higher rate of nuclear activity would be expected in interacting galaxies . however , different studies of this topic lead to contradictory results . in order to understand the role of the environment in the nuclear activity",
    "we need a statistically significant sample of isolated galaxies which will act as the baseline for this study .",
    "the study was developed in the frame of the amiga project ( for a detailed description of amiga see the contribution of j. sulentic in this proceedings ) .",
    "we applied a completeness test known as @xmath0 as explained in @xcite and @xcite to the amiga isolated galaxies obtaining a complete subsample which contains 710 galaxies .",
    "this sample constitute the base for our statistical studies .",
    "we made a catalogue of agn candidates of isolated galaxies looking for data in the literature and using three selection methods : fir colour , radiocontinuum - fir correlation radio - excess and based on the optical spectra @xcite .",
    "we did a cross - correlation of our sample with : a ) the ned ( nasa extragalactic database ) database : 77 galaxies found , 22 of them agn and b ) vron - cetty & vron active galaxies catalogue ( 12th edition ) : 25 galaxies found , 18 of them agn .    in the work of @xcite",
    "is shown a method to identify agn candidates using fir properties .",
    "galaxies hosting an agn have , in general , a flatter spectrum in fir .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it can find obscured agn that can not be observed using other wavelengths or methods .",
    "the success rate of the method is about 70% .",
    "we select the galaxies with an spectral index between @xmath1 and @xmath2 of @xmath3 .",
    "there are 58 agn candidates which amounts to 7% of the sample or 20% of the galaxies classified with this method .",
    "the correlation between the fir and the radio continuum emission is very tight and is attributed to star formation .",
    "deviation from this correlation may be produced by a radio - loud active nucleus .",
    "if the additional emission from the active nucleus is strong enough , an excess of radio emission will be found with respect to the radio - fir correlation .",
    "radio - excess galaxies are the ones whose radio luminosity is larger than 5 times the value predicted by the radio - fir correlation @xcite .",
    "there are 7 radio - excess galaxies in the complete sample which amount @xmath4 of the sample .",
    "this is a very low rate .",
    "there is a chance that the radio excess found using the nvss data is in fact due to a background / foreground source projected in the line of sight of the galaxy .",
    "we estimated that 14 of the radio detections in our sample could be due to unrelated sources . in order to determine which sources were genuine detections and which not we obtained high resolution vla radio continuum images of the radio - excess galaxies .",
    "finally , we found that all the radio emission excess in the radio - excess sources was produced by unrelated sources .",
    "this leads to a final rate of radio - excess galaxies of 0% .",
    "we also used the nuclear spectra from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "there are 353 spectra of amiga galaxies in the 6th data release .",
    "we obtained the underlying stellar populations using the starlight code .",
    "subtracting the estimated emission from the stellar populations we obtained the nebular emission and determined the presence of an agn , star formation or a transition object ( to ; with properties in between the former two types ) using the typical diagnostic diagrams .",
    "we also determined the type of agn when possible .",
    "only @xmath5 lack of emission lines , @xmath6 are classified as star forming , @xmath7 as tos and @xmath8 as agn .",
    "this is a significant fraction for a sample of isolated galaxies .",
    "we compared the radio - excess rate with other samples in denser environments : those referred to as field galaxies in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where usually no environmental selection criterion has been applied , and cluster samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the results are summarized in figure  [ re ] .",
    "we also took into account the possible effect of the luminosity as well a the morphology on the rate of radio - excess galaxies to avoid the biases coming from the morphology - density and luminosity - density relations .",
    "we found the same increase of the fraction of radio - excess galaxies toward denser environments independently of the luminosity or the morphology .",
    "we compared the rates of nuclear activity derived from the optical spectra with the ones found by @xcite for two samples of galaxies in compact groups ( cg ) .",
    "the reduction of the data and the measurement method were very similar .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ isol_cg ] .",
    "we will take into account the morphology and luminosity of galaxies in a future to avoid possible biases .",

    "we produced a final catalogue of agn - candidate galaxies which will provide a baseline for the study of the nuclear activity depending on the environment .",
    "we find that the fraction of fir selected agn - candidates ranges between 7% and 20% .",
    "there are no radio - excess galaxies in our sample above a factor 5 of radio excess which is the lowest rate found in comparison with other samples in denser environments , independently of the luminosity or the morphology .",
