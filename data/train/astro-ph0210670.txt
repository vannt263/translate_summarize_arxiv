    "in the present popular model for classical t tauri stars ( cttss ) , the so called class ii objects @xcite , a central young star is surrounded by a geometrically thin accretion disk .",
    "the disk is disrupted at a given radius by the magnetic field of the star . for smaller radii",
    "the accretion flow follows the magnetic field lines of the star until it impacts onto the stellar surface ghosh & lamb ( 1979 ) ; knigl ( 1991 ) .",
    "this magnetospheric accretion model explains observational signatures seen in some cttss as , for example , the excess of optical and ultraviolet continuum flux ( veiling ) , as well as redshift absorption features in emission line profiles ( muzerolle @xmath0 1998 ; hartmann , hewett & calvet 1994 ) .",
    "the plasma of the accretion disk flows along the dipole magnetic field lines towards the magnetic poles of the star .",
    "it is inhomogeneous in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field lines , but although somewhat more homogeneous along the field lines , cavities and plasma condensations ( plasmoids ) , aligned by the magnetic field , may be present .",
    "these plasmoids are distributed randomly in the plane perpendicular to the plasma flow .",
    "waves excited by the shock of the plasma flux with the star s surface can propagate upstream and interact with the plasmoids , creating a current , which in turn , will create current - carrying filaments .",
    "an upstream or downstream electric current can be driven by the waves or by the @xmath1-mhd effect in the truncated region of the disk .",
    "such filaments have been observed in the laboratory ( see , e.g. fadeev @xmath0 ( 1965 ) ; rosenberg @xmath0 ( 2001 ) ) .",
    "the occurrence of filaments has also been predicted in simulations of rotating magnetized disks ( machida @xmath0 2000 ) .",
    "hartmann , hewett & calvet ( 1994 ) and , more recently , muzerrole @xmath0 ( 1998 ) carried out calculations on magnetosphere accretion models , solving the radiative transfer equations in the sobolev approximation .",
    "theoretical balmer line profiles obtained were found to be in reasonable agreement with observations .",
    "the major uncertainty in radiative magnetosphere model calculations is the temperature profile along the tube .",
    "martin ( 1996 ) calculated the temperature profile from the energy balance of the gas , including heating by adiabatic compression of magnetic field lines , balmer photoionization , and ambipolar diffusion .",
    "however , the values of the temperature that he obtained were too low to explain the observed spectra .",
    "thus , additional heating mechanisms inside the tube are needed .",
    "the line - averaged electron temperature in the magnetosphere taken from optical measurements , is about @xmath2 ev ( see , e.g. hartmann , hewett & calvet 1994 ; martin 1996 ; muzerrole @xmath0 1998 ) . balancing the heating rate with the black body emission at a temperature @xmath3 ev , we find that about 5@xmath4 of the flux energy is sufficient to heat the downstream flux to a few ev .",
    "the main consumption of the flux energy is spent on plasma ionization . using laboratory experimental data for the ionization - recombination processes ( see delcroix 1965 ) , we can estimate the energy necessary for the plasma ionization rate to be about @xmath5 in the filament for electron temperatures of about @xmath6 ev .",
    "we use here a theoretical temperature profile , varying from @xmath7 k to @xmath8 k , to reproduce the optical line features observed .    taking into account the evidence for turbulence in the observations , as well as",
    "the necessity for an additional heating mechanism , vasconcelos , jatenco - pereira & opher ( 2002 ) suggested that alfvn waves may be important in the heating of magnetic flux tubes of cttss .",
    "they studied the possibility that the waves generated at the star s surface due to the shock are produced by the accreting matter , as suggested by scheurwater & kuijpers ( 1988 ) .",
    "various damping mechanisms for alfvn waves have been suggested in the literature , such as alfvn resonant heating of solar loops ( hollweg 1990 ; elfimov @xmath0 1996 ) , wave damping by phase mixing ( also in the solar context ) , and cyclotron heating , occurring as an alfvn wave travels down a magnetic field gradient until its frequency matches that of the cyclotron resonance of helium or some other plasma specie due to the decreasing ion - cyclotron resonance ( magnetic beach ) .",
    "in addition to the more conventional collisional and viscous - resistive alfvn wave damping ( osterbrock 1961 ) , vasconcelos @xmath0 ( 2002 ) concentrate on nonlinear and turbulent damping ( vasconcelos , jatenco - pererira & opher 2000 ) .",
    "nonlinear and turbulent damping have also been studied by jatenco - pereira & opher ( 1989a ) ; jatenco - pereira , opher & yamamoto ( 1994 ) in the solar wind , jatenco - pereira & opher ( 1989b ) in protostellar winds , jatenco - pereira & opher ( 1989c ) in late - type giant stars , dos santos , jatenco - pereira & opher ( 1993a ; 1993b ) in wolf - rayet stars , gonalves , jatenco - pereira & opher ( 1993a ; 1996 ) in quasar clouds and gonalves @xmath0 ( 1993b ) in extragalactic jets .",
    "the ( gaw ) has not been previously analyzed as a possible mechanism for the energy transport from the shock and truncation regions to the magnetosphere of t tauri stars .",
    "they were predicted in numerical calculations ( ross @xmath0 1982 ) using a cylindrical model for magnetized plasmas with an axial current and were observed later in tokamak experiments .",
    "gaws are excited in plasmas in a helical magnetic field , with the poloidal component produced by an axial current , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the axial magnetic field component and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the plasma radius and length , respectively .",
    "the so - called tokamak safety factor , @xmath13 , is considered to be unity . in cold plasmas with temperatures",
    "less than @xmath14 0.1 ev , gaws dissipate via electron - ion collisions .",
    "however , in hot plasmas , when the alfvn velocity , @xmath15 , is of the order of the electron thermal velocity , @xmath16 , gaws dissipate via electron landau damping .",
    "the electron landau damping mechanism is very effective when waves interact with a group of electrons that have velocities approximately equal to the wave phase velocity , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the frequency and @xmath19 is the wavenumber parallel to the magnetic field lines .",
    "electromagnetic field components related to gaws are proportional to @xmath20 $ ] , with poloidal @xmath21 and axial @xmath22 wave numbers .",
    "the requirement for these waves to propagate is that @xmath23 and @xmath24 , in the case of current flowing along the magnetic field .",
    "a gaw has a very large quality factor , ratio of frequency to dissipation decrement , @xmath25 and a very long dissipation length in comparison to their wave length , @xmath26 .",
    "thus it is a very good candidate to explain plasma heating far from a source , such as in solar loops @xcite . in addition",
    "a gaw is able to drive the current , which can be calculated by balancing the wave momentum transfer force with the electron - ion friction force ( elfimov @xmath0 1996 ) .",
    "we study here a two - fluid magnetohydrodynamic model of a young star , accreting plasma ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the standard parameters of cttss , similar to those used by vasconcelos @xmath0 ( 2002 ) , are assumed : star radius @xmath27 cm , truncated radius @xmath28 cm , truncated depth @xmath29 cm , magnetic field at the star s surface @xmath30 kg and @xmath31 kg in the truncated region , where the electron density is @xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "the length @xmath34 of the magnetic field lines from the shock at the star s surface to the truncated region is @xmath35 .",
    "the velocity of the shock is @xmath36 cm s@xmath37 at the star s surface and @xmath38 cm s@xmath37 in the truncated region .",
    "the ionization rate parameter @xmath39 for @xmath40 ev is @xmath41 @xmath42 s@xmath37 ( delcroix 1965 ) .",
    "the accretion energy density is defined by the ratio of the energy flux density to the path length @xmath34 . balancing ninety percent of the accretion power density @xmath43 with the ionization power density @xmath44 , we obtain a plasma with an average density along the magnetic field of @xmath45 @xmath33 .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field connecting the truncated disk and the star s surface consists of filaments , along which the gaw propagates .",
    "the filament current can be driven by the wave ponderomotive force ( see discussion below ) and/or by a magnetodynamo in the truncated region of the disk .",
    "the current , @xmath46}=5ab_{\\theta , ef}$ ] , and current density , @xmath47 stata @xmath48 , in a filament of radius @xmath11 can be produced by the electric field , @xmath49 statv cm@xmath37 , that is sufficient to create the required poloidal magnetic field @xmath51 for the gaw excitation .",
    "this electric field can be generated by the induction of a perpendicular electric field , @xmath52 statv cm@xmath37 , in the truncated region of the disk due to the magnetodynamo @xmath1 effect ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "a difference of potential on the scale of the filament radius is of the order of @xmath53 statv .",
    "this potential is much higher than is necessary and can generate a filament current with a hot electron tail and a characteristic velocity higher than that of the alfvn velocity @xmath54 , as was found in the plasma focus device .",
    "we expect that the electrons in the tail will remain hot in the filament by their interaction with the gaw .    for the parameters of the star assumed above",
    ", the phase velocity of a gaw , @xmath55 , is @xmath56 cm s@xmath37 at the center of the filament .",
    "taking into account the plasma resistance ( see , e.g. ginsbrug 1961 ) , the dissipation length of the alfvn waves can be estimated to be @xmath57 where @xmath58 this @xmath19 is a maximum value , determined by the condition that the dissipation length be sufficient so as to explain the plasma heating along the magnetic field from the truncated region to the star s surface .    assuming a conversion of 5@xmath4 of the total accreting plasma energy flux , @xmath59 , into the alfvn wave flux , @xmath60",
    ", we obtain a wave dissipation rate of @xmath61 erg @xmath33 s@xmath37 .",
    "this dissipation rate produces a wave momentum transfer force @xmath62 ( see elfimov @xmath0 1996 ) . balancing the wave momentum transfer force with the electron - ion friction force @xmath63",
    ", we obtain the density of the driven current , @xmath64 using a reduced friction , @xmath65 , for the electron tail with effective velocity @xmath66 and @xmath67 s@xmath37 ( @xmath68 cm s@xmath69 ) , we obtain the required current density , @xmath70 stata @xmath71 , in the filament . in this case , the electron tail that transports the current along the filament can be supported by the gaw via the electron landau damping , while the current in the filament can be driven by the gaw .    here , we also present the results of calculations for the gaw in the filament . in order to calculate the wave field and dissipation , we use the eikonal model to analyze the wave propagation along the filament ,",
    "exp@xmath72 $ ] , where @xmath73 is the coordinate along the filament axis and @xmath74 is the poloidal angle . in this case , in order to simplify the gaw calculations using numerical codes @xcite , instead of a dipole magnetic field , we assume a cylindrical model for the filament plasma with the current flowing along a magnetic field that has a helical magnetic field line configuration . to calculate the wave characteristics along the filament , we take the major radius @xmath75 cm comparable to the star s radius and the minor radius @xmath76 cm .",
    "the calculations are carried out with the electron density profile of the form @xmath77 with @xmath78 @xmath33 and @xmath79 @xmath33 .",
    "the temperatures are taken as @xmath80 ev and @xmath81 ev . the ion density is chosen so as to satisfy the requirement of charge neutrality , @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the densities of hydrogen and the other ions , respectively . in accordance with the spitzer conductivity @xmath85 , the current density profile has the form @xmath86 .",
    "the value of the safety factor , @xmath13 , is assumed to be unity at the filament axis and to monotonically increase up to four at the plasma boundary . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show the characteristic profile of the magnetic field as well as the dissipated power of the gaw for the filament parameters discussed above .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we observe the peaking of the dissipation at the filament center , which predicts filament center peaking of the electron temperature distribution , as well .",
    "the gaw heats the core of the filament to higher temperature , while reducing the plasma temperature at the filament border due to heat diffusion .",
    "the axial wavenumber of the gaw , @xmath87 , varies slowly along the magnetic field lines since it depends on changes in the local magnetic field and density .",
    "our analysis of gaws in the magnetospheres of cttss shows that : + a ) the energy of the shock ( and/or accretion disk region ) can be transported from the surface of the star ( and/or accretion disk region ) to the magnetosphere region by gaws via current carrying filaments ; + b ) the dissipation length of gaws is on the order of the truncation radius ; + c ) the conversion of only a few percent of the shock energy into gaws is required in order to heat the filaments up to the observed temperature of the star s magnetosphere ; + d ) the current in the filament may be induced by the electric field , created by the @xmath1-magnetodynamo effect in the truncated region of the disk .",
    "however , the major part of the current in the filaments is driven by gaws ."
