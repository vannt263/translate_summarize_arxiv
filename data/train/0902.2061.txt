    "this is a long story that , out of necessity , we collapse in a nutshell .",

    "this suggests that in this case the space of couplings is the infinite - dimensional cone @xmath133 of riemannian metrics over @xmath1 .",
    "however , since the action ( [ sigmamod ] ) is invariant under the action of the group of diffeomorphisms of @xmath1 , @xmath17 , we actually have that @xmath134 , where @xmath135 denotes the group of rescalings defined by @xmath136 , for @xmath137 a positive number .",

    "flow metric develops , somewhere , a region of large curvature , then the correspondence between the @xmath312flow and the ricci flow breaks down .",

    "thus , it may appear really amazing that ricci flow comes out so naturally from the renormalization group analysis of non  linear sigma models . since qft indicates that ( [ rf ] ) is just the weak coupling approximation to the full rg flow , there are also potentially useful implications in such a natural qft ambientation : the renormalization group approach may indeed points towards possible generalizations that may bypass known shortcomings of the ricci flow .",
    "is there a geometrical fact working behind the scene which can be held responsible of this ubiquitous role of the ricci flow both in geometry and rg analysis ?",
    "the answer is in the affirmative and it is intimately connected to the fact that the beta function @xmath115 for the rg flow can be seen as a vector field in the relevant coupling space @xmath3 of the given qft .",
    "as we have seen , in the case of non linear sigma model , a basic component of this coupling space is provided by the space of riemannian structures @xmath318 , and the answer to the above question lies in the fact that this space comes naturally endowed with a distinguished vector field which is proportional to the ricci tensor . to explain what this statement means ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath1 is a @xmath319 compact manifold without boundary , and let us denote by @xmath320 and @xmath321 the space of smooth functions and of smooth @xmath322tensor fields over @xmath323 , respectively . recall that we have denoted by @xmath324 the group of smooth diffeomorphisms of @xmath323 , and by @xmath325 the space of all smooth riemannian metrics over @xmath1 .",

    "generating @xmath369@xmath370 , and where , up to rescaling , we may assume that @xmath371 , ( respectively yielding for the _ shrinking , steady , and expanding solitons _ ) .",
    "the understanding of how the solutions to the ricci flow look as they approach a singular regime is a key step in exploiting the ricci flow in the proof of the geometrization conjecture .",
    "moreover , according to what we have seen in the analysis of rg for non linear sigma models , it is evident that also in such a setting singularity formation plays a basic role . in this latter case",
    "the relevant solutions of the ricci flow are the _ ancient solutions _ , the ones which exists on a maximal time interval @xmath372 , where @xmath373 .",
    "these correspond to renormalizable sigma - models . as suggested by r. hamilton @xcite , a natural classification of singularities",
    "can be based on how long the solution to the ricci flow exists and how such a solution scales asymptotically .",
    "let us recall that if a solution @xmath374 , @xmath375 , to the ricci flow develops a singularity at the maximal time @xmath358 , then such a singularity is said to be a type@xmath376 singularity ( rapidly forming ) if @xmath377 , whereas it is said to be a type@xmath378 singularity ( slowly forming ) if @xmath379 , where @xmath380 @xmath381 @xmath382 .",

    "+ in ricci flow theory there is a standard technique , connected to parabolic rescaling , that is used to study what happens as the ricci flow approaches a singularity .",
    "this is known as _ point picking _ ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite p.297 ) : assume that @xmath390 is a solution to the ricci flow defined on a maximal time interval @xmath391 , where @xmath392 , so that @xmath393 if @xmath394 . in order to understand the singularity which is forming as @xmath395 , one considers a sequence of points @xmath396 and times @xmath397 , and out of the given solution @xmath390 one constructs a sequence of solutions @xmath398 defined by @xmath399 , where @xmath400 .",
    "the interesting sequences for singularity formation are those for which @xmath401 , but note that on any fixed compact time interval the curvature of the metrics @xmath402 are bounded .",
    "this rescaling technique naturally opens the way to the application of gromov ",
    "hausdorff techniques in ricci flow theory , and indeed r. hamilton was able to prove a compactness theorem , ( uniform convergence in @xmath319 on compact sets ) , for solution to the ricci flow .",
    "the hypotheses under which hamilton s result holds require in an essential way a control ( uniform lower boundedness ) of the injectivity radiuses of @xmath398 at framed marked points @xmath403 , where @xmath404 denotes an orthonormal frame ( with respect to @xmath405 ) at @xmath406 .",
    "such a control is not a natural consequence of the parabolic rescaling technique described above and important developments in ricci flow theory have been strictly connected to devising ways of proving that such a control on the injectivity radius is naturally associated with solutions of the ricci flow . + removing the requirement on the injectivity radius is equivalent to considering collapsing sequences for solutions of the ricci flow , and it is indeed possible @xcite to extend hamilton s compactness theorem to collapsing sequences of metrics via a study of how the size of metric balls evolve under the ricci flow .",
    "this is very much in the spirit of rg group , since the delicate part of the proof is to understand the local geometry of the resulting limit space in a ( pointed ) gromov  hausdorff topology by describing the local geometry of collapsed limits of a sequence of riemannian manifolds .",
    "recently , such results have been extended by john lott and david glickenstein @xcite , who using the technique of riemannian groupoids have been able to piece together the local limit flows and show how one produces solitons in the limit .",
    "this has provided an understanding of the nature of the type ",
    "iii singularities that occur in the case of compact homogeneous geometries with a complete classification of the relevant 3dimensional case .",
    "it is important to stress that this analysis builds up on a way of discussing collapsing limit of ricci flow on a space which basically has the same dimension as the original manifold .",
    "collapsing takes the form of a symmetry ( the collapsing symmetry ) under which the limit ricci flow is equivariant . a phenomenon which appears similar to the mechanism generating a quantum field out of of a broken symmetry . without going into detail , under the action of this collapsing symmetry",
    ", the limit ricci solution takes the structure of a riemannian groupoid .",
    "this is a ( categorial ) notion familiar in foliation theory and in the study of the @xmath407algebra of a foliation .",
    "roughly speaking , the notion of riemannian groupoid unifies in a unique definition the notion of manifold , orbifold , and quotient manifold .",
    "as such it appears of great potential relevance in the study of the uv regime in the rg flow for non linear sigma models . +   + it is clear that the study of the nature of singularity formation is one of the main topic of interest in ricci flow theory since it provides an understanding of the structure of solutions in high curvature regions .",
    "relevant topological information about the long  time behavior of ricci flow solutions has been provided by perelman in his celebrated papers , however it is more than fair to admit that explicit and precise quantitative information is still missing . according to the analogies drawn here it is possible that the mathematical imagination of qft may suggest new strategies where the geometry , transcending and transgressing formal boundaries , is perhaps more comfortable .",
