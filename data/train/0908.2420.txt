    "neutron electric dipole moment ( nedm ) has attracted considerable attention over more than half a century . for an elementary particle to have non - vanishing intrinsic edm",
    ", simple analysis shows that parity - violating as well as time - reversal - violating interactions must be present .",
    "[ t - violation is equivalent to cp - violation ( combined charge - conjugation and parity ) in local quantum field theory .",
    "] however , in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , such interactions arise only from flavor - changing cabbibo - kobayashi - moskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements , which are strongly suppressed phenomenologically , yielding a very small neutron edm of order @xmath0 ecm .",
    "therefore , an experimental observation of a large - size neutron edm is an unambiguous signal for new physics , widely expected to exit somewhere between the electroweak symmetry breaking and tev scales .",
    "there has been much speculation in the literature on the nature of new physics .",
    "the leading theory is supersymmetry ( susy ) introduced to stabilize the electroweak scale against the fundamental planck scale ( for a good review , see ref .",
    "various extra dimensional models have been popular in recent years as well ( for good reviews see ref .",
    "there are other less dramatic possibilities including technicolor  @xcite , left - right symmetry  @xcite , minimal extensions of the sm  @xcite , little higgs models  @xcite , etc . in each of these models",
    ", there is new cp violation physics giving rise to a significant neutron edm . to test cp - violation mechanisms , it is important to get accurate predictions of cp - violating observables in these models .",
    "in particular , one has to deal with the non - perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) physics present in the structure of the neutron .",
    "an efficient way to calculate the neutron edm is to use the methodology of effective field theories ( eft ) . in this approach ,",
    "one generates p - odd and cp - odd quark and gluon operators after integrating out the heavy particles ( including heavy quarks , gauge bosons and new particles ) and run these operators to a scale around 1 gev where non - perturbative qcd physics becomes important .",
    "the effective degrees of freedom involves the light quarks ( up , down and strange ) and gluons .",
    "the cp - odd part of the lagrangian is generally written as a sum of cp - odd operators of different mechanical dimensions , @xmath1 where @xmath2 etc , is the mechanical dimension of the operators , @xmath3 is the renormalization scale ( taken as @xmath4 in this paper ) and @xmath5 sums over operators of the same dimension .",
    "the dim-3 operator is the usual cp - odd quark mass term @xmath6 , which can be rotated away through chiral rotations apart from the @xmath7 anomaly .",
    "the dim-4 operator is the usual @xmath8 term @xmath9 .",
    "dim-5 operators include quark electric and chromoelectric dipole operators .",
    "dim-6 operators contain various four - quark operators and weinberg three - gluon operator .",
    "the matrix elements of dim-4 and , to less extent , dim-5 operators have been studied extensively in the literature  @xcite , and the uncertainty of the estimates are typically at the level of factor 2 .",
    "the contributions of these operators have also been studied extensively in the context of various new physics models ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for good reviews ) .    however , the matrix elements of dim-6 operators have been a challenge to estimate . in some beyond - sm theories such as the left - right symmetric model ,",
    "dim-6 four - quark operators dominate the contributions to nedm . in the literature ,",
    "the only serious approach that has been proposed to calculate their matrix elements is the naive factorization method : breaking the four - quark matrix elements into the product of two - quark matrix elements between the nucleon states and between pion and vacuum  @xcite . while the factorization involving mesons can be and has been tested using lattice qcd  @xcite and the results may be trustable to within a factor of 2 , the same is not known for matrix elements involving the nucleon states .",
    "the goal of this paper is to develop a chiral perturbation method combined with simple quark models to estimate the four - quark contribution to the nedm with hopefully an improved accuracy .",
    "the approach we are going to take is the standard chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath10pt ) ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) which has been used to calculate the contribution of @xmath8-term to nedm  @xcite .",
    "one of the successes of the chiral approach can be illustrated by the polarizabilities of the nucleon .",
    "the electric polarizabilities of the proton and neutron have been extracted from experimental data , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "the leading contribution in @xmath10pt comes from the pion - nucleon intermediate states , @xmath13 which diverges linearly as @xmath14 and agrees well with the experimental data .",
    "one would expect then a similar pion dominance in the neutron edm because the latter also involves the intermediate electric dipole excitations . indeed a pioneering calculation by crewther et al .",
    "found that the dominant contribution from the charged - pion chiral - loop diverges logarithmically as @xmath15 goes to zero , and is proportional to the cp - odd pion - nucleon - nucleon coupling @xmath16  @xcite . in this paper , we take this contribution as dominating and consider the four - quark operator contribution to @xmath17 .",
    "of course , there are chiral - regular contributions to the nedm which are of the same order in chiral power counting and numerically competitive or even dominating in the real world  @xcite .",
    "we will consider these contributions as well , although the model - dependence becomes unavoidable .    in the chiral approach ,",
    "one first writes down the cp - odd and even lagrangian in terms of meson and nucleon fields , @xmath18 where the goldstone boson cp - odd lagrangian will generate terms annihilating @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the vacuum , or in other words , will produce meson condensates .",
    "the condensates will turn some of the cp - even terms ( as we shall see , those proportional to quark masses ) in the chiral lagrangian into cp - odd contributions .",
    "this will generate an additional cp - odd nucleon - mass term , neutron edm term and cp - odd pion - nucleon coupling .",
    "once this is done , one can rotate away the cp - odd nucleon mass term , generating further contributions to the neutron edm terms and the cp - odd pion - nucleon coupling .",
    "the presentation of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we classify all flavor - neutral p - odd and cp - odd four - quark operators in chiral representations",
    ". we also present the leading - order qcd scale evolution of these operators . in sec .",
    "iii , we match these operators to the corresponding goldstone boson operators , baryon operators , and edm operators in @xmath10pt .",
    "we also discuss in the case of peccei - quinn symmetry the size of the induced @xmath8 term in the presence of these four - quark operators . in sec .",
    "iv , we calculate their contributions to the p - odd and cp - odd nucleon - pion vertices and the cp - odd nucleon mass using factorization in the case of meson matrix elements and simple quark models for the nucleon ones . in sec .",
    "v , we study the four - quark contribution to the neutron edm in the chiral approach supplemented with factorization and quark model estimates of counter terms , and the results are compared with other calculations in the literature . the comparison and analysis show that the hadronic physics uncertainties here can be quantified to within a factor of two for operators generating unsuppressed meson condensate contributions .",
    "we conclude the paper in sec.vi .    to make the convention clear , the edm operator for spin-1/2 particles is defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath23 in the standard dirac representation .",
    "we consider three light quark flavors : up , down and strange .",
    "flavor - neutral p - odd and cp - odd four - quark operators can be divided into two groups @xcite : the first group includes 18 operators made of two different flavors : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the second group includes 6 operators made of a single quark flavor @xmath27 where @xmath28 are generators of the @xmath29 color group .",
    "all other flavor - neutral p - odd and cp - odd four - quark operators can be related to the above through fierz transformation @xcite .    to match the above quark operators into the hadronic ones in @xmath10pt , we have to classify the former into irreducible representations of the chiral group @xmath30 .",
    "take the operator @xmath31 as an example , which can be decomposed as @xmath32 where @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "the first term can be further decomposed as @xmath35 where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 with other elements vanishing",
    ". the second term of eq . ( [ 3 ] ) can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 in this way the operator @xmath41 is decomposed into @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 representations of @xmath30 , and @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 can be regarded as spurion fields in the sense that if they transform as @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath44 under chiral transformation , the corresponding terms in eqs .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 7 ] ) become invariant .",
    "these spurion fields will be used in @xmath51 to construct the effective operators corresponding to the same four - quark operators .",
    "all spurion fields for four - quark operators with different dirac and color structures are shown in table [ spurions1 ] .",
    "[ it is easy to see that there is no @xmath52 operator because any such operator must be expressible in terms of products of chiral - even quark currents , which can not yield cp - odd contributions . ]",
    ".spurions for cp - odd 4-quark operators .",

    "in this paper , we studied the four - quark contributions to the neutron edm , which dominate over other qcd operators in some new physics models .",
    "our approach was based on chiral expansion and simple quark models .",
    "it is well known in the literature that the leading chiral contribution comes from one - pion loop which dominates in the chiral limit @xmath14 , just like in the case of the nucleon electric polarizability .",
    "therefore , one needs to calculate the four - quark contribution to the cp - odd pion nucleon couplings .",
    "we studied these couplings in simple quark models , as an alternate to large-@xmath53 factorization .",
    "we also considered @xmath54 contribution from direct matching and pion - condensation to the dipole moment , as well as the cp - odd nucleon mass contribution through the magnetic moment .",
    "the resulting nedm can be compared with those from the naive factorization and qcd sum rules .",
    "the comparison provides us some idea on the hadronic physics uncertainty in the neutron edm calculation .",
    "our approach also provides a formalism for lattice qcd calculations of the nucleon matrix elements of the four - quark operators .    using the matrix elements thus obtained ,",
    "we obtain new - physics - independent upper bounds on the wilson coefficients of four - quark operators from the experimental data .",
    "the current experimental upper bound on neutron edm is @xmath55 cm  @xcite .",
    "if we assume that there is no significant cancelations among the contributions from these operators , we can use the experiment limit to give upper bounds to the wilson coefficients of individual operators . in our calculation",
    ", the strange quark effects were ignored , and we considered only operators composed of up and down quarks .",
    "the final results are shown in table [ upper ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the chiral - enhanced contribution is actually large-@xmath53 suppressed .",
    "in fact , the non - singular part of the chiral - loop contribution numerically dominates over the singular one .",
    "this suggests a large-@xmath53 analysis of the neutron edm , including the delta resonance contribution .",
