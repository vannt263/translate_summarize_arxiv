    "we essentially resolve this problem applying the strict statistical mechanics approach to uncorrelated random networks with arbitrary degree distributions .",
    "these random graphs constitute a basic class of complex networks .",
    "one should note that leading contributions to the spectra and the asymptotics of the random walk autocorrelator were found by bray and rodgers in 1988 in the particular case of the erds - rnyi graphs @xcite .",
    "it is important that these classical graphs necessarily have dead ends and vertices with two connections .",
    "we will show that the absence of these vertices in a network qualitatively changes the spectra and the random walk asymptotics .",

    "@xcite . due to a very specific organization of these graphs ,",

    "a graph is completely defined by its @xmath9 _ adjacency matrix _ @xmath10 , whose elements @xmath11 are the numbers of edges between @xmath12 and @xmath13 . the vertex degree of vertex @xmath12 is the number of edges , attached to this vertex : @xmath14 . in random networks",

    ", @xmath17 is a rapidly decaying function with a well - defined scale .",
    "for example , in the erds - rnyi model @xcite , which is a standard one , @xmath17 is a poisson distribution decaying as @xmath18 , i.e. , faster than any exponent .",
    "in contrast to these models , in most of real - world networks degree distributions are heavy tailed .",
    "after the work @xcite , they are usually approximated by a power - law @xmath19 in the range of sufficiently high degrees .",
    "note that the validity of this fitting is limited because real - world networks are small ( even the www has only about @xmath20 vertices ) , and so high degrees are not observable .",
    "it is commonly believed that the scale - free networks  are greatly distinguished from the others in every aspect .",
    "this widespread belief actually implies a division of all networks into two classes : scale - free networks  and all others .",
    "in contrast to these beliefs , we here show that scale - free ( or , more generally , heavy tailed ) architectures of networks are not essential for a lower edge of the laplacian spectra and the long - time behavior of random walks characteristics .",
    "the resulting dependences are determined by the minimum degree of vertices in a network .",

    "other versions of the laplace operator and corresponding processes , which are also widely discussed in literature , are listed in appendix [ a10000 ] .",

    "it is convenient that ( i ) this model is statistically homogeneous , ( ii ) all its vertices are statistically independent , and ( iii ) it has a locally tree - like structure .",

    "[ spectra ] .",
    "note an unusual singularity of the spectral density in the case @xmath45 .",

    "why is the minimum vertex degree so important in these problems ?",
    "note that in respect of random walks and laplacian operator related problems , infinite uncorrelated networks are equivalent to infinite bethe lattices with coinciding degree distributions .",
    "( recall that a bethe lattice is an infinite tree without borders . )",
    "let us compare two bethe lattices ",
    "random , with the minimum coordination number @xmath49 , and regular , with the coordination number equal to @xmath49 .",
    "it is clear that the autocorrelator in the random bethe lattice can not decay slower than in the regular bethe lattice with this @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath45 , then in this regular bethe lattice , @xmath50 @xmath51 , where @xmath52 @xmath1 is also the spectral boundary in the laplacian eigenvalue density @xmath8 of this regular bethe lattice , where @xmath53 , near @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the spectral boundary for an infinite uncorrelated network in principle can not be lower than that for the regular bethe lattice with the same @xmath49 . moreover , these borders coincide .",
    "the reason for this is the following feature of the configuration model of an uncorrelated network .",
    "let the number of vertices @xmath41 in this model approach infinity .",
    "then the mean number of given finite regular subgraphs with coordination number @xmath49 grows proportionally to @xmath41 .",
    "we stress that although this number rapidly decreases with a size of these subgraphs , it is proportional to @xmath41 for any given subgraph size .",
    "in the arbitrarily large subgraphs , the lowest eigenvalues are arbitrarily close to the spectral boundary of the corresponding regular bethe lattice .",
    "the number of these eigenvalues is proportional to the number of these subgraphs and so proportional to @xmath41 .",

    "the random networks with @xmath55 markedly differ from those with @xmath45 . in the configuration model with @xmath55 ,",
    "chains and chain - like subgraphs are statistically essential .",
    "let us first discuss the case @xmath56 .",
    "the bethe lattice with coordination number @xmath22 is a usual infinite chain .",
    "it has the spectral boundary @xmath4 . near this edge , @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the edge of the spectrum of the uncorrelated network with @xmath56 is zero .",
    "we will show that the statistics of chain subgraphs in this configuration model differ from those for the case @xmath45 .",
    "this results in different asymptotics presented in table  [ results ] and , schematically , in fig .",

    "these are , however , more chains ( see fig.[branches ] ) with branches attached .",
    "nonetheless , these subgraphs result in the spectrum edge @xmath58 and in the same asymptotics as for @xmath56 .",
    "when @xmath21 , numerous finite components components are present in the network .",
    "their mean number is proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "each of connected components gives one zero eigenvalue in the spectrum .",
    "this leads to a @xmath59-function peak at @xmath60 in the spectral density .",
    "the found singularities of @xmath8 , with all derivatives zero , have a direct consequence for observations in finite networks . even in a huge uncorrelated network",
