    "electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite is an appealing mechanism to explain the observed , big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , value of the baryon - to - entropy ratio  @xcite , @xmath2 , at the electroweak phase transition  @xcite , that can be tested at present and future high - energy colliders .",
    "although the standard model ( sm ) contains all the necessary ingredients  @xcite for a successful baryogenesis , it fails in providing enough baryon asymmetry . in particular",
    "it has been proven by perturbative  @xcite and non - perturbative  @xcite methods that , for higgs masses allowed by present lep bounds  @xcite , the phase transition is too weakly first order , or does not exist at all , and any previously generated baryon asymmetry would be washed out after the phase transition . on the other hand",
    "the amount of cp violation arising from the ckm phase is too small for generating the observed baryon asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "therefore electroweak baryogenesis requires physics beyond the standard model at the weak scale .    among the possible extensions of the standard model at the weak scale ,",
    "its minimal supersymmetric extension ( mssm ) is the best motivated one .",
    "it provides a technical solution to the hierarchy problem and has deep roots in more fundamental theories unifying gravity with the rest of interactions . as for the strength of the phase transition  @xcite",
    ", a region in the space of supersymmetric parameters has been found  @xcite-@xcite where the phase transition is strong enough to let sphaleron interactions go out of equilibrium after the phase transition and not erase the generated baryon asymmetry .",
    "this region ( the so - called light stop scenario ) provides values of the lightest higgs and stop eigenstate masses which are being covered at lep and tevatron colliders .",
    "the mssm has new violating phases that can drive enough amount of baryon asymmetry .",
    "several computations have been performed  @xcite-@xcite in recent years , showing that if the cp - violating phases associated with the chargino mass parameters are not too small , these sources may lead to acceptable values of the baryon asymmetry . in this talk",
    "i will present some aspects of a recent computation  @xcite of the cp - violating sources in the chargino sector which improves the computation of ref .",
    "@xcite in two main aspects . on the one hand , instead of computing the temporal component of the current in the lowest order of higgs background insertions",
    ", we compute all current components by performing a resummation of the higgs background insertion contributions to all order in perturbation theory .",
    "the resummation is essential since it leads to a proper regularization of the resonant contribution to the temporal component of the current found in ref .",
    "@xcite and leads to contributions which are not suppressed for large values of the charged higgs mass . on the other hand we consider , in the diffusion equations , the contribution of higgsino number violating interaction rate  @xcite from the higgsino @xmath0 term in the lagrangian , @xmath3 , that was considered in our previous calculations in the limit @xmath4",
    "the possibility of achieving , in the mssm , a strong - enough phase transition for not washing out any previously generated baryon asymmetry , characterized by the condition @xmath5 has been recently strengthened by three facts :    * the presence of light @xmath6 ( with small mixing @xmath7 ) considerably enhances the strength of the phase transition  @xcite .",
    "this is the so - called light stop scenario . *",
    "two - loop corrections enhance the phase transition in the sm  @xcite , and in the mssm  @xcite .",
    "* the validity of perturbation theory , and in particular the results of two - loop calculations , for the light stop scenario has been recently confirmed by non - perturbative results  @xcite .",
    "in fact , non - perturbative results lead to a stronger phase transition than perturbative ones , by @xmath8% .",
    "however the price the light stop scenario has to pay is that it may require moderately negative values of the supersymmetric parameter @xmath9 and then , apart from the electroweak minimum along the higgs ( @xmath10 ) direction , another color breaking minimum along the @xmath11 direction might appear .",
    "therefore both directions should be studied at finite temperature .    to systematically analyze the different possibilities we have computed the two - loop effective potential along the @xmath10 and @xmath12 directions and compared their cosmological evolutions with @xmath13 .",
    "the two - loop effective potential along the @xmath10 direction was carefully studied in ref .",
    "the one - loop correction is dominated by the exchange of the top / stop sector while the two - loop effective potential is given by two - loop diagrams with stops and gluons , as well as one - loop diagrams with the stop thermal counterterm .",
    "the two - loop effective potential along the @xmath12 direction was studied in refs .",
    "the mass spectrum is given in table 1 , where we have considered small mixing @xmath14 and large gluino masses .",
    ".mass spectrum along the @xmath12 direction .",
    "[ spectrum ] [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the one - loop diagrams correspond to the propagation of gluons , squarks and higgses as well as dirac fermions .",
    "the leading two - loop contributions correspond to sunset and figure - eight diagrams with the fields of table 1 propagating , as well as one - loop diagrams with thermal counterterm insertions corresponding to gluons and squarks .    for a given value of the supersymmetric parameters we have computed @xmath15 , the critical temperature along the @xmath10 direction , and @xmath16 , the critical temperature along the @xmath12 direction .",
    "therefore , four different situations can arise :    * * a ) * @xmath17 and @xmath18  @xcite . in this case",

    "we shall use these green functions to compute the left - handed and right - handed currents corresponding to @xmath31 at the point @xmath29 .    since the mass matrix depends on the space - time coordinates , and we must identify the free and perturbative parts out of it , in order to make such a selection we will expand the mass matrix around the point @xmath32 ( the point where we are calculating the currents in the plasma frame ) up to first order in derivatives as , @xmath33 where we use the notation @xmath34 .",

    ". this fact will have an important impact on the mechanism of baryon asymmetry .",
    "to evaluate the baryon asymmetry generated in the broken phase we need to first compute the density of left - handed quarks and leptons , @xmath81 , in front of the bubble wall ( in the symmetric phase ) .",
    "these chiral densities are the ones that induce weak sphalerons to produce a net baryon number .",
    "since , in the present scenario , there is essentially no lepton asymmetry , the density to be computed in the symmetric phase is @xmath82 where the density of a chiral supermultiplet @xmath83 is understood as the sum of densities of particle components , assuming the supergauge interactions to be in thermal equilibrium , @xmath84 .",

    "there are also the higgs number violating and axial top number violation processes , induced by the higgs self interactions and by top quark mass effects , with rates @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively , that are only active in the broken phase .",
