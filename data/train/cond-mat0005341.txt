    "complex perovskite alloys draw immense attention because of their exceptional dielectric and piezoelectric properties , which have great actual or potential uses.@xcite examples are the so - called `` super @xmath0 '' mixed - metal perovskites with low losses@xcite , such as ba(zn@xmath1ta@xmath2)o@xmath3 ( bzt ) and ba(mg@xmath1nb@xmath2)o@xmath3-bazro@xmath3 ( bmn - bz ) , and the relaxor ferroelectrics ( relaxors ) with extraordinarily high values of the relative permittivity and the piezoelectric constants@xcite , such as pb(sc@xmath4ta@xmath4)o@xmath3-pbtio@xmath3 ( pst - pt ) and pb(mg@xmath1nb@xmath2)o@xmath3 -pbti@xmath5 ( pmn - pt ) .",
    "an important aspect in complex perovskite alloys is the compositional atomic ordering , which is closely related to the desired properties .",
    "for example , it was indicated that the microwave - loss properties of 1:2 perovskite ceramics are very sensitive to the b - site cation ordering.@xcite in relaxors , it is widely accepted that the presence of the nanoscale ordered microregions is responsible for the relaxor behaviors.@xcite some investigations have been done on the atomic ordering of complex perovskites .",
    "considering the electrostatic interactions between the nearest b - site ions , zhang _ et al .",
    "_ presented an available quantitative criterion of the order - disorder transition and successfully explained many experimental results in a(b@xmath6b@xmath7)o@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite recently , bellaiche and vanderbilt used the electrostatic model to satisfactorily reproduce the various types of ordered structures in bmn - bz and other complex perovskites .",
    "@xcite in addition , the first - principle calculations were conducted to describe the ordering in some cases.@xcite    it has been revealed@xcite that the fourier transforms of the atomic interactions play important roles in the atomic ordering . in this paper , we adopt the parameters in the reciprocal space of atomic interactions and conduct a cluster variation method ( cvm)@xcite calculation to investigate the order - disorder transitions in complex perovskites .",
    "when considering the atomic ordering in complex perovskites , we can model @xmath8a(b@xmath9b@xmath10)o@xmath3-@xmath11ab@xmath12o@xmath3 as a three - component system ( @xmath13)(b@xmath9b@xmath10)@xmath14b@xmath12 on a simple cubic bravais lattice . @xmath15=1/3 for 1:2 perovskites such as bmn - bz , and @xmath15=1/2 for 1:1 perovskites such as pst - pt .",
    "the driving mechanism responsible for the ordering is mainly the electrostatic interaction.@xcite introduce @xmath16 -1 , 0 , or + 1 in the case of @xmath17 if @xmath18 is occupied by b@xmath19 , b@xmath12 or b@xmath20 . in the case of @xmath21 ,",
    "introduce @xmath16 -2 , 0 , or + 1 for b@xmath19 , b@xmath12 or b@xmath20 .",
    "the charge fluctuation of ions at * r * , @xmath22 , is proportional to @xmath23.@xcite the electrostatic energy between a pair of cations at * r * and * r*@xmath19 is proportional to @xmath24 or @xmath25 , i.e. ,    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the effective - interaction energy . in a purely coulomb picture@xcite , @xmath28 . in the nearest - neighbor coulomb picture@xcite , @xmath29 is equal to zero unless * r * is the nearest neighbor .",
    "different from the two pictures , we do not make any assumption on the form of @xmath29 here .",
    "the energy of the system with a certain configuration @xmath30 can be expressed as    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is a constant independent on @xmath30.the average value of the energy is ( @xmath32 is neglected )    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the statistic probability of the configuration @xmath30 , and @xmath35 is the pair occupation probability .    when the atomic interaction is long range , eq .",
    "( 3 ) is difficult to handle in cvm because a large cluster should be used to contain the long - range interaction .",
    "therefore , some approximation should be made .",
    "expand @xmath35 in a fourier transform : @xmath36,\\ ] ] and substituting it into eq .",
    "( 3 ) yields @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the fourier transform of @xmath29 : @xmath39    for a certain ordered structure , only a few @xmath40 in eq . ( 5 ) are nonzero under the single - particle approximation.@xcite we assume that this property is still valid in cvm .",
    "the assumption is not absurd since in experiments there are only a few superlattices for a certain ordered structure .",
    "( 5 ) can be simplified .",
    "for example , for the 1/2\\{111}-type - ordered structure [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] , all lattice sites are divided into two nonequivalent groups .",
    "only the superlattice @xmath41 are nonzero .",
    "then the energy is reduced to @xmath42 by using the symmetry of the ordered structure , we can evaluate @xmath41 from a small cluster and deal with eq .",
    "( 7 ) in cvm .",
    "it is noted that @xmath43 involves any long distance interactions . for the 1/3\\{111}-type ordered structure ,",
    "lattice sites are divided into three groups , @xmath44 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 .",
    "four - point basic clusters ( fig . 1 ) are chosen in our cvm calculation .",
    "the 1/2\\{111}-type ordered structure occurs in both 1:2 and 1:1 complex perovskites .",
    "@xmath46 is required since it is a necessary condition for the 1/2\\{111}-type ordered structure to appear .",
    "first , the ordering transition type is specified .",
    "the long - range order parameters ( lro ) are defined as @xmath47 which represent the occupation - probability difference between nonequivalent sites . @xmath48 for b@xmath19 , b@xmath20 , and b@xmath12 as functions of the reduced temperature @xmath49 are plotted in fig . 2 when @xmath21 and @xmath50 .",
    "( the reduced temperature is defined as @xmath51 in this figure and the following fig .",
    "it shows that @xmath48 decreases gradually to zero when increasing temperature .",
    "so the ordering transition is the second order . for 1:1 complex perovskites ( @xmath15=1/2 ) ,",
    "the transition is also the second order .",
    "3 depicts the curves of @xmath48 as functions of the composition @xmath11 when @xmath15=1/3 and @xmath52 .",
    "it shows that @xmath53 increases when decreasing @xmath11 , while @xmath54 and @xmath55 reach their maxima near @xmath50 .",
    "the appearance of the maximum in lro is consistent with the experimental findings in bzt - bz@xcite and previous theoretical work@xcite . for 1:1 complex perovskites ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    "are equal to each other and increase with decreasing @xmath11 , but @xmath56 keep equal to zero in all range of @xmath11",
    ".    the critical temperatures of the phase transition , @xmath57 , can be determined at different @xmath11 values .",
    "approximately , @xmath57 decrease linearly with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "the 1/3\\{111}-type ordered structure is observed only in 1:2 complex perovskites .",
    "the calculated curves of the long - range order parameters @xmath48 as functions of the reduced temperature @xmath49 when @xmath11=0.25 are shown in fig .",
    "( in this figure and thereafter , @xmath49 is defined in @xmath58 where @xmath59 . ) it can be seen that lro of the 1/3\\{111}-type ordered structure suddenly drop to zero at the transition temperature , which indicates that the transition is the first order .",
    "the 1/2\\{111}- and 1/3\\{111}-type ordered structures are separately discussed above .",
    "in actual cases , which ordered phase to appear is determined by the free energy , i.e. , at a certain composition , the ordered phase with the minimal free energy will become the equilibrium phase and can be observed in experiments .    in the investigations above",
    ", the model is parameter - free in the sense that @xmath60 and @xmath61 define the temperature scale .",
    "when we consider the 1/2\\{111}- and 1/3\\{111}-type ordered phases at the same time , a ratio @xmath62 should be introduced . for the purely coulombic interactions@xcite , @xmath63 ; for the nearest neighbor interaction@xcite , @xmath64 .",
    "adopting @xmath65 , we plot in fig .",
    "5 the free energy curves of the 1/2\\{111}- and 1/3\\{111}-type ordered structures for @xmath21 .",
    "it shows that the 1/3\\{111}-type ordered phase appears at small @xmath11 values , and the 1/2\\{111}-type phase favors larger @xmath11 values , which agrees with results in bmn - bz@xcite .",
    "the boundary of @xmath11 values for the 1/2\\{111}- and 1/3\\{111}-type ordered phases is determined by the crossing of the curves .",
    "the combined phase diagram of the system is shown in fig .",
    "the phase region of the 1/3\\{111}-type ordered phase near @xmath66 is located inside the region of the 1/2\\{111}-type ordered phase .",
    "when @xmath67 decreases , the phase region of the 1/3\\{111}-type ordered structure gets smaller and smaller , and vanishes at last .",
    "this may be the cases in pmn@xcite and pmt@xcite in which only the 1/2\\{111}-type ordered phase is observed .",
    "of course , the source of the small @xmath67 can not be solved in the theoretical framework of this paper .",
    "the effective energy parameters are affected by the a - site and o - site ions .",
    "perhaps the different effects of the pb and ba@xcite can provide some clues on this problem .",
    "for 1:1 complex perovskites ( @xmath17 ) , the chemical formula is favorable to form the 1/2\\{111}-type ordered structure , so the situation is different from that of @xmath21 .",
    "the free energy curves are depicted in the inserted graphics of fig .",
    "9 when @xmath17 .",
    "the curve of the 1/3\\{111}-type ordered structure wholly lies above that of the 1/2\\{111}-type phase .",
    "it suggests that the 1/3\\{111}-type ordered phase is impossible ( or difficult ) to form in 1:1 complex perovskites such as pb(sc@xmath4ta@xmath4)o@xmath3@xcite and pb(mg@xmath4w@xmath4)o@xmath3@xcite .",
    "the 1/2\\{111}- and 1/3\\{111}-type atomic ordering in complex perovskites have been studied by the cluster variation method . for the 1/2\\{111}-type ordered phase ,",
    "the transition is the second order , and the order parameter reaches its maximum near x=0.25 for 1:2 complex perovskites . for the 1/3\\{111}-type ordered phase , the transition is the first order.the order - disorder transition line is found to obey the linear law .",
    "the phase diagram containing both ordered structures is obtained .",
