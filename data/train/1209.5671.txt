    "characterizing the mineralogical zoning of tts disks at different radii is necessary to discriminate between these different scenarios .",
    "another major component of dust in disks is water ice , which may play an important role in forming planetesimals , either by helping grains stick together @xcite or by increasing the dust to gas mass ratio at the snowline , which may induce the accumulation of grains at this location @xcite .",

    "we see no evidence for a forsterite feature at 69@xmath0 m . in the irs spectrum , we identify the major crystalline features by fitting a non - parametric locally weighted scatterplot smoothing ( lowess ) baseline to the data , taking this as the ` dust continuum ' beneath the molecular lines , and subtracting a linear fit to regions between known crystalline silicate features to the irs spectrum ( fig . [ forstrdfit]a ) .",
    "there are strong forsterite features at 23 and 33@xmath0 m , blended forsterite - enstatite features at 18 and 28@xmath0 m , and weak enstatite features around 11@xmath0 m .    to determine the composition and structure of the disk , we construct temperature and density structures using the @xcite irradiated accretion disk models , which assume the disk is heated by stellar irradiation and viscous dissipation .",

    "whether the ice grains have grown larger than the silicate grains , we consider three size distributions : ( case @xmath12 ) the same power law dependence and @xmath11 as the silicate and graphite grains ; ( case @xmath13 ) the same power law dependence but a larger @xmath11 ; ( case @xmath14 ) a power law dependence of @xmath15 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this model ,",
    "ice exists everywhere below the thermal sublimation temperature ; while other processes , e.g. photodesorption , are likely to modify this snowline @xcite , a self - consistent treatment is beyond the scope of this letter and reserved for future work .",
    "we compute opacities for the graphite and water ice grains using optical constants from @xcite and @xcite and mie theory , assuming that the grains are segregated spheres @xcite .",
    "silicates are divided into amorphous and crystalline versions of two stoichiometries : olivines ( @xmath16 ) and pyroxenes ( @xmath17 ) , where @xmath18 indicates the iron content .",
    "opacities for the amorphous olivine and pyroxene are computed with optical constants from @xcite that have @xmath19 for olivine and range from @xmath20 to @xmath21 for pyroxene .",
    "the opacities for crystalline olivine ( forsterite ) and pyroxene ( enstatite ) are taken directly from those calculated by @xcite .",
    "we implement a vertical dust sublimation wall with an atmosphere following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "dust is present once the disk temperature drops below the dust sublimation temperature , and this radius , @xmath22 , defines the radial location of the beginning of the wall atmosphere , where the dust is optically thin .",
    "we allow the dust properties of the wall to vary independently of those in the disk to simulate the effects of a radial gradient in the inner disk mineralogy ; in particular , we vary the iron content of the silicates in the wall , while in the disk we assume the iron content of the best - fitting amorphous olivine and pyroxene determined by @xcite from comparison with disks in taurus .    as input to the code",
    ", we assume the stellar and accretion properties within the range given by sd08 ( values listed in table [ sampletab ] ) . they measured high veiling in the system over the course of a month and estimated mass accretion rates between 10@xmath23 and 10@xmath24 @xmath25/yr from comparing their observed emission lines with magnetospheric accretion models ; we adopt an intermediate value of 5@xmath2610@xmath23 @xmath25/yr .",
    "the outer radius is not totally unconstrained , as the mass ratio range of the companion is 0.014 to 0.03 , which is too large for the circumprimary disk to radially extend over the 1:2 binary orbital resonance @xcite .",
    "therefore the disk can be at most 70au in radius .",
    "we create a grid of @xmath1350 models varying @xmath27 , @xmath7 , @xmath28 , the ice mass fraction ( @xmath29 ) , silicate composition , and @xmath30 and minimize the reduced @xmath31 statistic , @xmath32 , between the models and observations to determine the best fit . while there are degeneracies between @xmath27 , @xmath7 , @xmath33 , and @xmath30 , the large wavelength coverage of our sed allows us to break some of them .",
    "for example , only @xmath34 can provide enough continuum emission to fit the irs spectrum , while @xmath35 fits the slope between pacs r1s and the 1.3 mm photometry . likewise , smaller disks ( e.g. @xmath3620au ) underproduce the 20 to 35@xmath0 m absolute flux while larger disks ( e.g. @xmath3670au ) overproduce the 100 to 140@xmath0 m flux .",
    "once these parameters have been constrained , this implies an @xmath7 between 0.1 and 0.01 .",
    "however , since the fit to @xmath7 comes mainly from the submillimeter flux , which depends on the surface density , @xmath37@xmath6/@xmath7 , the estimated range of @xmath6yields 0.02@xmath380.2 for the same fit to the sed .",
    "models without ice fail to reproduce either the shape or absolute flux of the pacs b2a spectrum ; in fig [ varyice]a we show this model and how the sed changes when ice with the distributions given by the previously defined size distributions case @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is added .",
    "case @xmath12 lowers the flux too much over the _",
    "range and fails to produce enough flux over b2a .",
    "case @xmath13 produces only a slight increase in the flux between 55 and 70@xmath0 m . with case @xmath14 , we are able to produce enough flux over both the irs and pacs range . for case @xmath14 ,",
    "the b2a and r1s spectra are better reproduced by different @xmath39 , 15@xmath0 m and 50 to 70@xmath0 m , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ varyice]b ) .",
    "the mass fraction of ice that produces the best fit to the data for this disk structure is 2@xmath2610@xmath40 with respect to gas , or @xmath125% of the total dust content , which is half of the solar composition @xcite .",
    "although our model includes ice at this abundance in the midplane as well , because the disk has so little dust settling , we would require spatially resolved submillimeter photometry to test whether the midplane ice abundance differs from that of the upper layers .",
    "the best fitting wall has an @xmath11 of 3@xmath0 m and is comprised of 100% glassy pyroxene with fe/(fe+mg)=0.4 . with the assumption of a radially uniform disk composition , the best - fitting models require silicate grains with @xmath11=0.25@xmath0 m and a mixture of 80% amorphous silicates , of which 5% are olivine and 75% pyroxene ( fe/(fe+mg)=0.2 ) , and 20% crystalline silicates , evenly split between forsterite and enstatite .",
    "although our model does not yet include radial composition gradients , we can still use it to probe the location of the crystalline silicates .",
    "we compute a grid of theoretical disks truncated outwardly at 5au intervals from 50au to 5au for compositions of pyroxene - forsterite and pyroxene - enstatite , allowing the individual crystalline silicate fractions to vary between 5% and 30% . by isolating the model forsterite features in the same manner as for the irs spectrum",
    ", we see that the models with sufficient forsterite abundance to fit the 33@xmath0 m feature produce too much flux in the 23@xmath0 m features ( fig .",
    "[ forstrdfit ] ) and _ vice versa _ , indicating that forsterite is not uniformly distributed throughout the disk .    to compare the data with the emission from an annular region of the disk",
    ", we subtract the emission of the other radii from the 50au disk and compare the ratio of the 23 to 33@xmath0 m feature to determine which emitting annulus is the best match to our data .",
    "forsterite distributed between 20 and 50au fits the relative fluxes best and implies a forsterite silicate fraction of @xmath118% in this region .",
    "a match to the observed enstatite emission of an annulus of 10 to 20au with a fraction of 15% is obtained in the same way .",
    "we note that the non - detection of the 69@xmath0 m forsterite feature in the pacs spectrum places an upper limit of 90% on the forsterite fraction in the outer disk upper layers . to cross - check our results , we perform a two - temperature spectral decomposition ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the irs spectrum .",
    "its results confirm that the inner disk is dominated by large , amorphous pyroxene grains with no crystalline grains detected at @xmath41 .",
    "the outer disk , however , contains small pyroxene grains with forsterite and enstatite present at @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the resulting system properties , assuming radially constant dust abundances in the disk , are listed in table [ sampletab ] .",
    "the final best fit has @xmath32=1.2 , and is displayed in fig .",
    "[ gqbestfit ] .",
    "the radius of the wall is proportional to the ratio of a grain s opacity weighted by the stellar and local temperature and the assumed dust sublimation temperature . of the grains we tested , grains with @xmath44=0.4 ( 40% fe content ) had the largest opacity ratio ,",
    "so they absorb heat more efficiently than they emit it and achieve the dust sublimation temperature at larger radii than grains with less iron . for a wall",
    "whose height is given in a fixed number of gas pressure scale heights , the solid angle to the observer is then larger , and therefore the peak observed flux is greater .",
    "the high iron content of our inner disk is consistent with the fe / mg @xmath11 ratio found , on average , for pre - solar silicate grains in meteorites @xcite .",
    "however , this work does not explore the possibility that other near - infrared continuum sources that might be expected in the inner disk , e.g. metallic iron which represents 60% of mercury s total mass , could be present in the wall .",
    "the large maximum grain size of the wall , taken in conjunction with the high @xmath6and little settling , is indicative of the turbulent enrichment of the inner disk atmosphere with large grains seen in other systems by @xcite .",
    "it also suggests that there is a radial gradient in the maximum grain size of the upper layers , as the outer disk is best fit with 0.25@xmath0 m grains .",
    "although the silicate and graphite grains are small in the outer disk , we can reproduce better the broader shape and flux of the sed from 50 to 70@xmath0 m with a population of larger ice grains in the upper disk layers ( fig .",
    "[ varyice]b ) .",
    "the 63@xmath0 m peak is best fit by an @xmath11 of 15@xmath0 m and a larger @xmath27 , while a range of @xmath11 between 20 and 50@xmath0 m can provide the bulk of the excess flux between 30 and 100@xmath0 m .",
    "the fact that we need ice grains two orders of magnitude larger than the silicate grains and with a different grain size distribution power law is consistent with simulations for ice enhancement of grain growth that take recondensation into account @xcite , if we assume that their ice - coated dust grain opacities can be approximated by our segregated ice grain opacities when @xmath39 is large .",
    "the better fit to the 120@xmath0 m region provided by the 50@xmath0 m ice grains may indicate either a radial or vertical gradient in the ice grain size , which we do not yet implement in this version of our model .",
    "we can think of two potential explanations for why we might see an ice emission feature in this system and not ( to the best of our knowledge ) in other systems .",
    "first , the disk of gq lup is highly unsettled ( @xmath27=0.1 - 0.5 ) .",
    "this implies mixing of grain populations between the midplane and upper layers .",
    "if icy grains are inclined to settle to the midplane or are formed there , we may see them because they are being turbulently lifted back to the disk surface .",
    "additionally , the lack of settling means that the location of the @xmath45 isocontour ( which defines where ice ceases to be photodesorbed @xcite ) is at a large enough vertical height in the disk that some ice should remain on the grains above the @xmath46 surface for 63@xmath0 m emission .",
    "alternatively , if there are planetesimals in the disk , they would not appear to be large enough to clear a gap on the order of tens ofau , as we do not see evidence for one in the sed ( although we note that this does not constrain smaller gaps ; * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of a massive , gaseous disk of @xmath30=30 - 100au at the onset of the formation of jovian planets has been simulated to scatter smaller planetesimals in the disk , populating high inclination orbits at @xmath140au @xcite .",
    "if some of these icy planetesimals were to collide , it could generate a reservoir of icy grains in the upper layers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of the 63@xmath0 m feature is also of particular interest , as it appears only in crystalline ice , and the crystallization temperature of initially amorphous water ice is typically @xmath47k @xcite .",
    "although the densities in our disk structure imply an ice sublimation temperature of at most 120 k @xcite , it has been shown that ice deposited on grains at 160 k and subsequently cooled to 14 k maintains the 63@xmath0 m opacity peak @xcite .",
    "this implies that gq lup has experienced significant heating and cooling events in the outer disk .",
    "localized heating could also explain the annular crystalline distribution suggested by the last analysis in ",
    "[ allanalysis ] .",
    "this distribution is not indicative of transport models , which we would expect to yield monotonically decreasing abundances , like those found by @xcite for some herbig aebe stars .",
    "however , there are _ in situ _ mechanisms that could form crystals at tens ofau . for a typical t tauri star",
    ", @xcite found that shocks from gravitational instabilities can anneal dust between 5 and 10au , assuming an annealing temperature around 1200 k. crystalline dust could also be produced through collisions of parent bodies , as seen in older stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "given the 3 myr age of gq lup , it is not unfeasible that kbo - size planetesimals could have formed in the outer disk .    in conclusion",
    ", the mineralogical and disk structure properties of gq lup make it an interesting object with which to test theories of planetesimal formation .",
    "the grains have grown to micron size in the inner disk , while the outer disk is highly unsettled and shows signs of water ice in its pacs spectrum at sizes consistent with models of ice - enhanced grain growth .",
    "the presence of crystalline ice and silicates at temperatures below their crystallization temperature and in annular distributions is indicative of a periodic _ in situ _ heating mechanism .",
