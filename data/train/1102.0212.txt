    "@xmath0 of the orbit of the moon e_meas = ( 93)10 ^ -12  yr^-1based on an analysis of a long llr data record spanning 38.7 yr ( 16 march 1970 - 22 november 2008 ) performed by @xcite with the suite of accurate dynamical force models of the de421 ephemerides @xcite including all relevant newtonian and einsteinian effects .",
    "notice that is statistically significant at a @xmath6level .",
    "the first presentation of such an effect appeared in @xcite , in which an extensive discussion of the state - of - the - art in modeling the tidal dissipation in both the earth and the moon was given .",
    "later , @xcite , relying upon @xcite , yielded an anomalous eccentricity rate as large as @xmath7 yr@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite commented that is not compatible with present , standard knowledge of dissipative processes in the interiors of both the earth and moon , which were , actually , modeled by @xcite .",
    "the relevant physical and osculating orbital parameters of the earth and the moon are reported in table [ tavola ] .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     it can be noticed that the physical and orbital features of x postulated by such two recent theoretical models would induce long - term variations of the lunar eccentricity much smaller than .",
    "conversely , it turns out that a tidal parameter as large as _",
    "x=4.4610 ^ -24  s^-2would yield the result of .",
    "actually , is totally unacceptable since it corresponds to distances of x as absurdly small as @xmath8 au for a terrestrial body , and @xmath9 au for a jovian mass @xcite .",
    "we must conclude that not even the hypothesis of planet x is a viable one to explain the anomalous increase of the lunar eccentricity of .",
    "in this paper we dealt with the anomalous increase of the eccentricity @xmath0 of the orbit of the moon recently reported from an analysis of a multidecadal record of llr data points .",
    "we looked for possible explanations in terms of unmodeled dynamical features of motion within either the standard newtonian / einsteinian paradigm or several long - range models of modified gravity .",
    "as a general rule , we , first , noticed that it would be misleading to simply find the right order of magnitude for the extra - acceleration due to this or that candidate effect .",
    "indeed , it is mandatory to explicitly check if a potentially viable candidate does actually induce a non - vanishing averaged variation of the eccentricity .",
    "this holds , in principle , for the search of an explanation of any other possible anomalous effect . quite generally , it turned out that any time - independent and spherically symmetric perturbation does not affect the eccentricity with long - term changes .",
    "thus , most of the long - range modified models of gravity proposed in more or less recent times for other scopes are automatically ruled out .",
    "the present - day limits on the magnitude of a terrestrial rindler - type perturbing acceleration are of the right order of magnitude , but it does not secularly affect @xmath0 . as time - dependent candidates capable to cause secular shifts of @xmath0",
    ", we considered the possible variation of the earth s gravitational parameter @xmath10 both because of a temporal variation of the newtonian constant of gravitation @xmath11 and of its mass itself due to a steady mass accretion of non - annihilating dark matter . in both cases ,",
    "the resulting time variations of @xmath0 are too small by several orders of magnitude .    moving to standard general relativity",
    ", we found that the gravitomagnetic lense - thirring lunar acceleration due to the earth s angular momentum , not modeled in the data analysis , has the right order of magnitude , but it , actually , does not induce secular variations of @xmath0 .",
    "the same holds also for other general relativistic spin - dependent effects .",
    "conversely , @xmath0 undergoes long - term changes caused by the general relativistic first - order effects due to the earth s oblateness , but they are far too small .",
    "the second - order post - newtonian part of the gravitational field does not affect the eccentricity .    within the newtonian framework , we considered the action of an almost circular massive ring modeling the edgeworth - kuiper belt of trans - neptunian objects , but it does not induce secular variations of @xmath0 . in principle",
    ", a viable candidate would be a putative trans - plutonian massive object ( planetx / nemesis / tyche ) , recently revamped to accommodate certain features of the architecture of the kuiper belt and of the distribution of the comets in the oort cloud , since it would cause a non - vanishing long - term variation of the eccentricity . actually , the values for its mass and distance needed to explain the empirically determined increase of the lunar eccentricity would be highly unrealistic and in contrast with the most recent viable theoretical scenarios for the existence of such a body .",
    "for example , a terrestrial - sized body should be located at just 30 au , while an object with the mass of jupiter should be at 200 au .",
    "thus , in conclusion , the issue of finding a satisfactorily explanation of the observed orbital anomaly of the moon still remains open .",
    "our analysis should have effectively restricted the field of possible explanations , indirectly pointing towards either non - gravitational , mundane effects or some artifacts in the data processing .",
    "further data analyses , hopefully performed by independent teams , should help in shedding further light on such an astrometric anomaly .",
