    "heterogeneity often plays an important role in various adsorption processes and its presence may profoundly modify the adsorption isotherms and other thermodynamic properties compared to the homogeneous situation .",
    "consequently , numerous articles@xcite , reviews @xcite and monographs @xcite have been published that describe experimental , theoretical and numerical studies in the area .",
    "the disorder may originate from the energetic or structural heterogeneity of the substrate or from the adsorbate species .",
    "heterogeneity may also result if the adsorbed molecules are large enough so that multisite adsorption becomes possible @xcite .    in a recent article @xcite , we investigated the properties of a lattice model of adsorption on a disordered substrate that can be solved exactly ( see also refs.@xcite ) .",
    "we showed that there exists an exact mapping to the system without disorder in the limits of small and infinite activities and we exploited this result to obtain an approximate , but accurate description of the disordered system .    for continuous systems , structural disorder",
    "may be represented by the random site model ( rsm ) in which adsorption sites are uniformly and randomly distributed on a plane @xcite .",
    "the molecules , represented by hard spheres , can bind to these immobile sites .",
    "steric exclusion is expressed by the fact that a site is available for adsorption only if the nearest occupied site is at least one particle diameter away . in addition , adsorption energy is assumed equal for each adsorbed molecule .",
    "therefore , the disorder of this model is characterized by the dimensionless site density , @xmath0 , only .",
    "the degree of complexity increases drastically because steric effects , which usually dominate the adsorption on continuous surfaces , are modified by the local disordered structure of adsorption sites .",
    "this model may be appropriate for the reversible adsorption of proteins on disordered substrates@xcite .",
    "oleyar and talbot @xcite examined the reversible adsorption of hard spheres on the 2d rsm and proposed an approximate theory for the adsorption isotherms based on a cluster expansion of the grand canonical partition function .",
    "although successful at low site densities , the quality of the theory deteriorates rapidly with increasing site density and fails completely above a certain density .    in sections ii and iii we develop a general statistical mechanical description of the rsm model and we confirm the intuitive result that in the limit of large site density the system maps to hard spheres adsorbing on a continuous surface .",
    "then , for finite site density , we prove that for the one - dimensional system in the limit of infinite activity , there is a mapping to a hard rod system at a pressure @xmath1 .",
    "we also present an argument supporting the validity of this result in higher dimensions .",
    "note that when the activity is `` strictly '' infinite , desorption is no longer possible and the adsorption process is irreversible . in this case",
    "the model has an exact mapping to the random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) of hard particles on a continuous surface @xcite .    in sections",
    "iv and v we propose approximate theoretical schemes for the adsorption isotherms in one and two dimensions that interpolate between the limits of small and large activities for a given site density @xmath0 . comparison with simulation results",
    "shows that these approaches are a considerable improvement over the cluster expansion .",
    "for completeness we note that in addition to its application to adsorption , the model is also interesting because of its relationship to the vertex cover problem@xcite .",
    "a vertex cover of an undirected graph is a subset of the vertices of the graph which contains at least one of the two endpoints of each edge . in the vertex cover problem one seeks the _ minimal vertex cover _ or the vertex cover of minimum size of the graph .",
    "this is an np - complete problem meaning that it is unlikely that there is an efficient algorithm to solve it .",
    "the connection to the adsorption model is made by associating a vertex with each adsorption site .",
    "an edge is present between any two vertices ( or sites ) if they are closer than the adsorbing particle diameter .",
    "the minimal vertex cover corresponds to densest particle packings .",
    "weight and hartmann@xcite obtained an analytical solution for the densest packing of hard spheres on random graphs , but the existence of the geometry in adsorption processes implies that the machinery developed to describe adsorption on random graphs can not be used in rsm models .",
    "the adsorption surface is generated by placing @xmath2 points , representing adsorption sites , randomly and uniformly on a substrate , either a line in 1d or a plane in 2d ( the boundary conditions are irrelevant in the large @xmath2 limit ) .",
    "spheres of diameter @xmath3 may bind , centered , on an available adsorption site .",
    "a site is available if the nearest occupied site is at least a distance @xmath3 away .",
    "two points are connected , and therefore can not be simultaneously occupied , if they are closer than @xmath3 .",
    "the positions of the @xmath2 sites are denoted by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a index running from @xmath6 to @xmath2 .",
    "the sites are quenched during the adsorption - desorption process .",
    "the adsorbed phase in equilibrium with a bulk phase containing adsorbate at activity @xmath7 can be formally described with the grand canonical partition function :    @xmath8    where the microscopic density of sites @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 @xmath11 is the activity , @xmath12 denotes the position of sphere @xmath5 and @xmath13 is the mayer f - function which is equal to @xmath14 if spheres @xmath5 and @xmath15 are closer than @xmath3 and @xmath16 otherwise .",
    "( [ eq : pf ] ) applies to a particular realization of the quenched variables @xmath17 . in order to average over disorder",
    ", it is necessary to take the average not of the partition function , but of the logarithm of the partition function @xcite . by using standard rules of diagram theory@xcite ,",

    "we show in appendix a that the average of the logarithm of the partition function over disorder can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 i.e. , @xmath31 , is the partition function of hard spheres on a continuous surface at an activity @xmath32 .",
    "this result shows that when the site density @xmath0 goes to infinity and that the activity @xmath7 goes to @xmath16 , with the constraint that the product @xmath33 remains finite , the random site model maps to a system of hard particles in continuous space .",
    "the number density of adsorbed molecules can be computed directly from the partition function : @xmath34 with again @xmath32 .",
    "by using eq.([eq:21 ] ) given in the appendix , one obtains to the second - order in @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number density of the hard sphere model in continuous space .",

    "the expansion of @xmath40 and @xmath39 in powers of the activity when @xmath41 can also be generated from the above equations in straightforward way .",
    "the limit of large activity , @xmath42 , is expected to lead to the maximum density of adsorbed spheres for a given density @xmath0 of adsorption sites .",
    "indeed , this limit combines the presence of a relaxation mechanism , which is induced by the infinitesimally small but non - zero desorption process that allows a sampling of hard - sphere configurations , with the guarantee that no sites left open for adsorption will stay empty .",
    "the one - dimensional model is then amenable to an exact solution in the limit @xmath42 .",
    "interestingly , it maps onto an equilibrium system of hard rods in continuum ( 1d ) space at the same density ( which is of course a function of @xmath0 )    the adsorbed density @xmath43 in the 1d case can be obtained exactly with the following simple probabilistic argument .",
    "assume that a given site is occupied .",
    "then all sites that lie within a distance @xmath3 from this site must be unoccupied . in the the optimally packed system the next site beyond this",
    "must be occupied .",
    "the average distance from an arbitrary point to the first site is @xmath35 giving the average distance between two occupied sites as @xmath44 .",

    "specifically let @xmath50 denote the probability density associated with finding a gap of size between @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "in an optimally packed configuration , the probability to find a gap of length @xmath51 is related to the probability to find the first site at a given distance @xmath51 ( say to the right ) of an arbitrary point . for a poissonian distribution of sites",
    "this simply leads to @xmath53 the reasoning is easily extended to multi - gap distribution functions , @xmath54 , where two successive gaps are neighbors in the sense that they are separated by a single particle .",
    "one then shows that all these higher - order gap functions factorize in products of one - gap distribution functions , e.g. @xmath55 .",
    "the outcome of this probabilistic argument is that the 1d random site model is equivalent to an equilibrium system of hard rods on a ( continuous ) line at the pressure @xmath56 indeed , from the known equation of state of the hard rod fluid @xcite one has @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath58 , which corresponds to eq .",

    "extension of the above arguments to higher dimensions is far from straightforward .",
    "first , in @xmath60 and higher , one may encounter at high adsorbed density phase transitions to ordered , crystalline - like , phases .",
    "second , the simplicity of the reasoning in terms of gaps characterized only by their length is lost when one leaves the one - dimensional case . for these reasons ,",
    "we have not been able to develop a rigorous demonstration of a mapping between the 2d rsm and the ( homogeneous ) hard - disk system at equilibrium at the same density when the activity @xmath7 goes to infinity .    to nonetheless make some progress ,",
    "let us consider the nearest neighbor radial distribution function @xmath61 introduced by torquato @xcite .",

    "this somewhat generalizes the 1-gap distribution function to any spatial dimension . for a poissonian distribution of particle centers of density @xmath63 in @xmath60 ,",
    "one finds that @xmath64 no exact formula exists for @xmath61 in a hard disk fluid . using the results of reference @xcite one can , however , demonstrate that in the large @xmath62 limit at an equilibrium pressure @xmath65 it is given by @xmath66 the reasoning now goes as follows . consider a maximally occupied configuration ( associated with the limit @xmath42 ) in the 2d rsm with an adsorption site density @xmath63 and consider a given adsorbed particle .",
