    "a precise characterization of the dynamics of mesoscopic and macroscopic systems is a very important problem for applications in nanotechnologies and biophysics .",
    "while fluctuations always play a negligible role in large systems , their influence may become extremely important in small systems driven out of equilibrium . such is the case for nanoengines and biological processes , where the characteristic amount of energy transferred by fluctuations can be of the same order as that which operates the device . in these small out of equilibrium systems , dominated by thermal fluctuations ,",
    "a precise estimation of the free energy difference @xmath0 between two equilibrium states @xmath1 and @xmath2 is extremely useful to increase our knowledge of the underlying physical processes which control their dynamical behaviour . it is well known that @xmath0 can be estimated by perturbing a system with an external parameter @xmath3 and by measuring the work @xmath4 done to drive the system from @xmath1 to @xmath2 . when thermal fluctuations can not be neglected",
    "@xmath4 is a strongly fluctuating quantity and @xmath0 may in principle be computed using the jarzynski equality ( je ) @xcite and the crooks relation ( cr ) @xcite ( see section 2 for their definition ) . indeed",
    "the je and cr take advantage of these work fluctuations and relate the @xmath0 to the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the work performed on the system to drive it from @xmath1 to @xmath2 along any path @xmath5 ( either reversible or irreversible ) in the system parameter space .",
    "numerous derivations of the je and cr have been produced @xcite and je and cr have been used in order to estimate the free energy of a stretched dna molecule @xcite .",
    "however the derivation of je in the case of strongly irreversible systems has been criticized in ref.@xcite . for this reason in a recent letter @xcite ,",
    "we have experimentally checked je and cr on a very simple and controlled device in order to safely use these two relations in more complex cases as the biological and chemical ones , where it is much more difficult ( almost impossible ) to verify the results with other methods .",
    "our system is a mechanical oscillator , in contact with a heat bath , which is driven out of equilibrium , between two equilibrium states @xmath1 and @xmath2 , by a small external force . in ref.@xcite",
    "we have shown that the je and cr are experimentally accessible and valid for all the values of the different control parameters .",
    "however one may wonder whether the driving force s switching rate and its amplitude were fast and large enough .",
    "therefore in this paper we extend the measurements of ref.@xcite till the limits of the experimental set up .",
    "we find that even in these extreme cases the @xmath0 is correctly estimated by je and cr .",
    "we also observe that these experimental results can be exactly derived from a langevin equation if one takes into account that , experimentally , the properties of the thermal noise are not changed by the external driving force .",
    "these conditions are close to those pointed out in ref.@xcite for the validity of the je , thus they do not fully alight the theoretical debate . however the fact of having driven the system at large driving amplitudes and the study of the corresponding langevin dynamics allow us to clearly understand the experimental limits of applicability of the je and cr . independently on the theoretical problems that the derivation of je may rise , these limits are of statistical nature and they strongly reduce the possibility of using je and cr when the driving energy is much larger than the thermal energy . as a consequence these intrinsic statistical limits make the experimental test of the criticisms arisen in ref.@xcite very difficult almost impossible . however ,",
    "when the fluctuations of @xmath4 are gaussian we propose here an alternative method to compute @xmath0 , which can be useful even in cases where the je and the cr could not hold .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "in section 2 we recall the je and cr and we discuss the gaussian case . in section 3",
    "we describe the experimental setup and in section 4 the experimental results . in section 5",
    "we show that for a langevin equation the je gives the exact value of the free energy difference for any path . in section 6",
    "we discuss the limits of applicability of je and cr and we conclude .",
    "in 1997 @xcite jarzynski derived an equality which relates the free energy difference of a system in contact with a heat reservoir to the pdf of the work performed on the system to drive it from @xmath1 to @xmath2 along any path @xmath5 in the system parameter space .",
    "specifically , when @xmath3 is varied from time @xmath6 to @xmath7 , jarzynski defines for one realization of the `` switching process '' from @xmath1 to @xmath2 the work performed on the system as @xmath8 }      { \\partial \\lam } \\d t ,      \\label{work}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 denotes the phase - space point of the system and @xmath10 its @xmath3-parametrized hamiltonian ( see also @xcite and section 2.4 ) .",
    "one can consider an ensemble of realizations of this `` switching process '' with initial conditions all starting in the same initial equilibrium state .",
    "then @xmath4 may be computed for each trajectory in the ensemble . the je states that @xcite    @xmath11 } \\rangle ,      \\label{je}\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 denotes the ensemble average , @xmath13 with @xmath14 the boltzmann constant and @xmath15 the temperature . in other words",
    "@xmath16 } \\rangle = 1 $ ] , since we can always write @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the dissipated work . thus it is easy to see that there must exist some microscopic trajectories such that @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , the inequality @xmath20 allows us to recover the second principle , namely @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath22 . from an experimental point of view",
    "the je is quite useful because there is no restriction on the choice of the path @xmath5 and it overcomes the above mentioned experimental difficulties .    as we have already mentioned in the introduction , many proofs of the",
    "je have been done .",
    "the simplest way to understand je is to consider the perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this kind of approach has been used by landau @xcite but he considered only gaussian distributions and he stopped the development to the second order .",
    "this technique can be generalized to get je . therefore we follow ref.@xcite and we write the energy @xmath23 of the system in contact with a heath bath at temperature @xmath15 as :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the energy introduced by the external driving @xmath26 such that @xmath27 . by definition the @xmath0",
    "is given by    @xmath28 } d \\gamma \\label{partition}\\ ] ]    where @xmath29}$ ] is the equilibrium gibbs distribution in @xmath1 , that is the unperturbed state .",

    "crooks considers the forward work @xmath35 to drive the system from @xmath1 to @xmath2 and the backward work @xmath36 to drive it from @xmath2 to @xmath1 .",
    "if the work pdfs during the forward and backward processes are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , one has @xcite @xmath39 ) }      = \\exp{[\\beta w_{\\mathrm{diss } } ] }      \\label{crooks}.\\ ] ] a simple calculation from eq.([crooks ] ) leads to eq.([je ] ) .",
    "however , from an experimental point of view this relation is extremely useful because one immediately sees that the crossing point of the two pdfs , that is the point where @xmath40 , is precisely @xmath0 .",
    "thus one has another mean to check the computed free energy by looking at the pdfs crossing point @xmath41 .",
    "let us examine in some detail the gaussian case , that is @xmath42 ^ 2}{2 \\sigma_w^2}}\\bigr)$ ] .",
    "in this case the je leads to @xmath43 i.e. @xmath44 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that landau @xcite derived eq.[eqgausf ] , which can also be viewed as a consequence of the linear response theory as it has been shown by hermans @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see from eq.([crooks ] ) that if @xmath37 and @xmath45 are gaussian , then @xmath46 and @xmath47 thus in the case of gaussian statistics @xmath0 and @xmath18 can be computed by using just the mean values and the variance of the work @xmath4 .      before describing the experiment ,",
    "we want to discuss several important points .",
    "the first is the definition of the work given in eq.([work ] ) , which is not the classical one .",
    "let us consider , for example , that @xmath26 is a mechanical torque @xmath48 applied to a mechanical system @xmath49 , and @xmath50 the associated angular displacement @xmath51 .",
    "then , from eq.([work ] ) , one has @xmath52_{0}^{t_s } - w^{\\mathrm{cl}},\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the classical work ( we define the classical work with minus sign to respect the standard convention of thermodynamics ) . thus @xmath4 and @xmath54 are related but they are not exactly the same and we will show that this makes an important difference in the fluctuations of these two quantities .",
    "this difference between the @xmath4 and @xmath55 , has been already pointed out in ref.@xcite .",
    "the second important point that we want to discuss concerns the @xmath0 computed by the je in the case of a driven system , composed by @xmath49 plus the external driving .",
    "the total free energy difference is @xmath56_a^b = \\delta f_0 - \\phi ,      \\label{eqdeltaf}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the free energy of @xmath49 and @xmath58_a^b$ ] the energy difference of the forcing .",
    "the je computes the @xmath0 of the driven system and not that of the system alone which is @xmath57 .",
    "this is an important observation in view of all applications where an external parameter is added to @xmath49 in order to measure @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "finally we point out that , in an isothermal process , @xmath57 can be easily computed , without using the je and the cr , if @xmath54 is gaussian distributed with variance @xmath59 .",
    "( we make the reasonable assumption that forward and backward work variances are equal . ) indeed the crossing point @xmath60 of the two gaussian pdfs @xmath61 and @xmath62 is @xmath63 which by definition is just @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath65 . furthermore the dissipated work can be obtained from @xmath66 by definition .",

    "this is important because it shows that the in cases where the conditions a ) and b ) are verified , the je gives the right result independently of the path to go from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , which can be a very irreversible one .",
    "we may now repeat the calculation for the harmonic oscillator of eq.([eqoscillator ] ) .",
    "in such a case let us introduce the following notations @xmath210 and @xmath211 with this notation the mean solution of eq.([eqoscillator ] ) in absence of noise , with initial conditions @xmath212 , is @xmath213 \\qquad \\mathrm{for } \\qquad",

    "notice that in this case too the result is independent on the path .",
    "thus the je gives the right result of @xmath0 for the langevin equation with an harmonic potential .",
    "before concluding we want to discuss the limits on the use of je and cr in an experiment where the dynamics can be either exactly described or well approximated by a langevin equation . from the values of @xmath202 and of @xmath219 , computed in sect . 4 for the overdamped case and for the harmonic oscillator case",
    ", we see that if @xmath118 is kept constant then @xmath220 whereas @xmath221 .",
    "furthermore as @xmath222 is proportional to @xmath223 , this means that the distance between the maxima of @xmath37 and @xmath45 increases with @xmath223 and the relative width @xmath224 of @xmath159 decreases as @xmath225 . as a consequence ,",
    "the probability of finding experimental values of @xmath4 close to the crossing points also decreases as @xmath225 .",
    "this effect has been seen on the experimental @xmath159 plotted in fig.[highdrive ] . from a practical point of view , this means that when @xmath226 the pdfs will never cross , for reasonable values of the work pdf . as a consequence the experimental test of je and cr in systems with a strongly irreversible driving force , as proposed in ref.@xcite , will be very difficult to test .",
    "indeed at such a large and fast driving , the je and cr may fail , either for deep theoretical reasons or simply because the statistics is too poor . at the moment we are not able to answer to this question .",
    "furthermore , for real ( macroscopic ) systems it is reasonable to think that when the external noise becomes much larger than the thermal noise , the je can not be used .",
    "however , if the pdfs of @xmath54 remain gaussian , then the crossing point @xmath60 gives the right result .      in conclusion",
    "we have used a driven torsion pendulum to test experimentally the accuracy of je and cr . by varying the amplitude and the rising time of the driving torque of about one order of magnitude",
    ", we clearly demonstrate the validity and the robustness of the je and cr in an isothermal process , at least when the work fluctuations are gaussian and when the harmonic approximation is relevant for the system .",
    "we have checked the generality of the results on a driven langevin equation which well describes the dynamics of the oscillator . using the experimental observations that the equilibrium properties of the thermal noise are not modified by the driving force and that the force fluctuations are gaussian , we have shown that the je gives the right result independently of @xmath151 and @xmath118 .",
    "unfortunately these results do not fully alight the theoretical debate , because our conditions are close to those pointed out in ref.@xcite for the validity of the je . recently , ritort and coworkers have used the je and cr to estimate @xmath0 in an experiment of rna stretching where the oscillator s coupling is non - linear and the work fluctuations are non - gaussian @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to check these results on a more simple and controlled system .",
    "we are currently working on the experimental realization of such a non - linear coupling , for which @xmath227 .",
    "we have also shown both analytically and experimentally that @xmath228 decreases as @xmath225 .",
    "this observation makes the practical use of the je and cr rather unrealistic for very large @xmath151 as the statistics needed to get a reliable result will be very large .",
    "this means , as we have already discussed at the end of the previous section , that the je can not be applied for macroscopic systems when the external noise becomes much larger than the thermal noise .",
    "going back to the estimate of @xmath0 we have seen that the more accurate and reliable @xmath0 estimator is given by the crossing points @xmath229 and @xmath60 , because they are less sensitive to the extreme fluctuations which may perturb the convergence of the je .",
    "starting from this observation , we propose a new method to compute @xmath0 in the case of gaussian fluctuations of @xmath54 . indeed , for gaussian pdfs @xmath60 remains an excellent estimator even in cases where the je and the cr could not hold , for example when the environmental noise can not be neglected .",
    "finally we want to stress that our results , although limited to the gaussian case , show that it is possible to measure tiny work fluctuations in a macroscopic system . as a consequence it opens a lot of perspective to use the je , the cr and the recent theorems on dissipated work ( see for example @xcite ) to characterize the slow relaxation towards equilibrium in more complex systems , for example aging materials such as glasses or gels @xcite .",
