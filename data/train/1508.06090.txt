    "temperature resolved data were recorded from 50  @xmath10 up to 700  @xmath10 on a powdered sample , using the synchrotron radiation on the ailes beamline at soleil , combined with an ifs 125 spectrometer and a helium cooled bolometer .",
    "the sample temperature was scanned from 8 k to 300 k. spectra were obtained in the transmission configuration with a resolution of 1  @xmath10 .",
    "the powdered sample was staked between two polymer films stretched on a copper disk with a 4  mm diameter hole . an identical copper disk with polymer film",
    "was measured at room temperature and used as a reference to determine the absolute transmission @xmath11 .",
    "we present here absorbance data i.e. @xmath12 .",
    "single crystal measurements were recorded at room temperature with a vertex 70v spectrometer in a reflection configuration within @xmath13 from the normal incidence .",
    "the refelctivity was measured in two spectral ranges : in the far infrared range , 50 - 690  @xmath10 at 1  @xmath10 resolution , we used a mercury lamp , a silicon beamsplitter combined with an helium cooled bolometer . in the mid infrared range ,",
    "560 - 6000  @xmath10 at 2  @xmath10 resolution , we used a globar lamp , a kbr beamsplitter combined with a nitrogen cooled mct detector .",

    "two different plaquettes were measured , with the @xmath6-axis perpendicular to the plaquette plane ( z configuration ) or within the plane ( y configuration ) .",
    "phonon modes with e symmetry are expected in both z and y configuration , while a@xmath1 symmetry modes should be visible in the y configuration only .",
    "the infrared spectra from 50  @xmath10 up to 700  @xmath10 are presented in figure  [ fig2 ] for the powder spectra recorded at different temperatures at soleil as well as for the single crystal spectra at room temperature recorded on the vertex spectrometer up to 1200  @xmath10 .",
    "many phonon modes are visible extending from 70  @xmath10 up to 1000  @xmath10 .",
    "the room temperature data from both sets of measurements are consistent .",
    "the vertex data allow us to identify some a@xmath1 and e modes while the synchrotron data give us the temperature dependence of the whole phonon spectra below 700  @xmath10 with a high sensitivity .",
    "we identified a total of 30 modes among the 34 expected in p321 symmetry .",
    "a close inspection on the powder spectra reveals that , the 30 observed total number of modes remains constant in the whole temperature range , which extends from well below the magnetic ordering temperature ( 27  k ) to well above the supposed helical polarisation temperature ( 120  k ) .",
    "clearly , no signature of symmetry breaking as a function of temperature is evidenced here .    to further confirm p321 symmetry through the whole temperature range , raman measurements were performed .",
    "those measurements were performed on the single crystal samples used for reflectivity measurements ( y and z configurations ) .",

    "a close examination at the non assigned experimental modes reveals that most of them are very close to a e assigned one .",
    "in fact , in the p321 space group , @xmath15 and @xmath17 should be identical and we should only see 10 + 22=32 different frequencies in raman scattering and not 44 as observed .",
    "such a splitting of the doubly degenerated e modes prompt us to abandon the 3-fold axis as a symmetry element . under this condition",
    "the space group should be lowered from p321 to its c2 subgroup .",
    "the irreducible representation correspondence between the two groups are as such @xmath19 table  [ tab : phc2 ] reports the phonon modes computed within the c@xmath1 group and their experimental assignment .",
    "note that , within this group , there are two negative phonons frequencies in the b irreducible representation indicating that this group is unstable and the c@xmath1 symmetry should also be revisited , at least in the low temperature phase .",
    "there are still four computed modes unassigned and a few experimental modes that do not correspond to any calculated frequency ( in blue in table  [ tab : phc2 ] ) .",
    "we thus computed again the phonon spectrum within the p@xmath9 space group ( also reported in table  [ tab : phc2 ] ) . as expected ,",
    "all calculated phonon modes are now found stable .",
    "in addition all computed modes can easily be assigned to experimental ones with a good accuracy .",
    "indeed the average error between computed and measured frequencies is within 6.1@xmath10 .",
    "one should however note that the few experimental modes in the 640770@xmath10 range remain unassigned .",
    "a few conclusions can be drawn at this point .",
    "first , the p321 space group usually assumed in the literature for this system is not the correct group for the @xmath20 langasite .",
    "indeed , the @xmath21 rotation around the c - axis is broken , even at room temperature   thus allowing a static polarisation in the ( a , b ) plane to take place   but also the in plane @xmath22 rotation axis is expected to be lost , allowing also for a polarisation along the c direction . even when lowering the symmetry , the calculations could not account for the phonons in the whole frequency range .",
    "since all the other phonon modes are reproduced with a very good accuracy , it is unlikely for the computational technique to be at fault .",
    "one should thus look for other reasons .",
    "crystalline phases impurities may be invoked to explain the extra experimental modes , however some of the excitations observed in raman spectroscopy within the 640 - 770  @xmath10 range are very intense .",
    "in addition , the 677 and 772  @xmath23 modes have previously been measured on a different sample by an other group  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that impurities could explain the experiment - theory discrepancies .",
    "the only remaining possibility is that both the initial point group and the unit cell are incorect .",
    "at this point one should remember that the magnetic unit cell corresponds to a @xmath24 super - cell .",
    "we therefore computed the phonon modes in a double ( 2c ) and triple ( 3c ) cell along the c - direction within the p321 space group .",
    "unfortunately the size of these calculations does not allow to go up to a 7c unit cell or p1 space group .",
    "nevertheless , these calculations clearly show that even in a double or triple unit cell , we still do not find phonon modes in the 640 - 770  @xmath10 range .",
    "the spectrum of the triple unit cell however presents the emergence of new phonon modes at very low energy ( @xmath25 ) .    0.3c@c@ p1ex@c@c + raman & ir & + freq & freq & & irrep & freq +   + & & & b & -137 + & & & b & -17 + & 71 & & b & 76 + 83 & 82 & & a & 81 + & 87 & & a & 93 + 99 & & & a & 96 + & & & a & 97 + & & & b & 110 + & & & * b*&*116 * + & 126 & & a & 124 + 129 & 128 & & b & 124 + & 142 & & b & 137 + 140 & & & a & 139 + 148 & weak & & b & 145 + & & & * b*&*174 * + & & & a & 179 + & & & a & 180 + & & & b & 191 + & & & a & 191 + 197 & 196 & & a & 194 + 206 & & & b & 201 + 218/222 & & & a & 223 + 226 & 227 & & a & 228 + & 236 & & b & 230 + & & & b & 248 + & & & a & 249 + & & & b & 250 + & 260 & & b & 259 + 273 & & & b & 280 + & & & a & 288 + & & & b & 290 + 301 & 301 & & a & 300 + & 316 & & b & 316 + 321 & 322 & & a & 320 + 331 & & & a & 333 + 362 & & & b & 379 + & & & * a*&*391 * + 408 & 411 & & b & 402 + 418 & & & a & 406 + 422 & & & b & 419 + & 430 & & a & 438 + 454 & & & b & 450 + & & & * a*&*465 * + & & & * b*&*469 * + 480 & & & b & 473 + & 484 & & a & 488 + 503 & & & b & 515 + 509 & & & a & 517 + 525 & 524 & & b & 519 + & 546 & & b & 556 + 573 & & & a & 561 + & & & a & 562 + & & & b & 563 + & 598 & & b & 591 + 615 & 608 & & a & 594 + 622 & & & b & 621 + 630 & & & a & 623 + 781 & & & a & 788 + 836 & & & a & 831 + & 847 & & b & 841 + 868 & & & b & 868 + 884 & & & a & 876 + & & & a & 905 + & & & b & 906 + 937 & & & b & 965 + 983 & 983 & & a & 978 +    0.3c@c@ p1ex@c@c   + raman & ir & + freq & freq&&irrep & freq +   + & 71 & & a & 74 + & & & a & 82 + & & & a & 83 + & & & a & 84 + & & & a & 93 + & & & a & 94 + & & & a & 96 + & & & a & 97 + 99 & & & a & 98 + & 126 & & a & 124 + & & & a & 124 + & & & a & 124 + 140 & & & a & 139 + & 142 & & a & 140 + 148 & weak & & a & 142 + & & & a & 179 + & & & a & 180 + & & & a & 181 + 190 & 189 & & a & 192 + 197 & 196 & & a & 194 + 206 & & & a & 196 + 218 & & & a & 222 + 222 & & & a & 223 + 226 & 227 & & a & 229 + & 236 & & a & 230 + & & & a & 249 + & & & a & 250 + & 260 & & a & 250 + 273 & & & a & 279 + & & & a & 288 + & & & a & 288 + & & & a & 299 + & & & a & 301 + & 316 & & a & 319 + 321 & 322 & & a & 320 + 331 & & & a & 333 + & & & a & 392 + & & & a & 393 + 408 & 411 & & a & 407 + 418 & & & a & 408 + 422 & & & a & 439 + & 430 & & a & 440 + & & & a & 465 + & & & a & 466 + 480 & & & a & 473 + & 484 & & a & 489 + 503 & & & a & 512 + 509 & & & a & 517 + 525 & 524 & & a & 517 + & 546 & & a & 557 + & & & a & 560 + & & & a & 561 + 573 & & & a & 563 + & 598 & & a & 595 + 615 & 608 & & a & 597 + 622 & & & a & 623 + 630 & & & a & 625 + 781 & & & a & 789 + 836 & & & a & 832 + & 847 & & a & 832 + 868 & & & a & 868 + 884 & & & a & 875 + & & & a & 905 + & & & a & 905 + 937 & & & a & 963 + 983 & 983 & & a & 978 +    c@c +   + raman freq . & ir freq . + . & * 640 + * 677 & . +",

    "extension to the lower energy of the infrared spectra was performed on the ailes beamline at soleil on single crystals using a helium pumped bolometer with the same experimental conditions as in @xcite .",
    "results are presented in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "sharp modes are observed between 54  @xmath10 and 62  @xmath10 .",
    "since they are very sharp and their spectral weight is small compared to the phonon modes above 70  @xmath10 , we attribute them to localised defects inside the sample or at its surface .",
    "their temperature dependence is plotted in figure  [ fig7 ] for two different polarisation of the thz wave . clearly , the mode at 56  @xmath10 splits below t@xmath4=120  k , an indication that its local environment has lowered its symmetry .",
    "such local defects act as a probe of crystallographic changes in the bulk crystal that occur below t@xmath4 .    at even lower energy , as previously published @xcite , a magneto - electric excitation",
    "is observed below t@xmath4=120",
    "k. at 16  k for instance , this electro - active excitation occurs at 29  @xmath10 and the magneto - active one at 23  @xmath26 .",
    "signature of these excitations can also be found in raman spectroscopy .",
    "thanks to our raman optical set - up , we could measure low energy excitations in the 10 to 70  @xmath10 range .",
    "the spectra for all polarization configurations in the y - crystal ( back - scattering along the a - axis ) are shown on fig.[fig8 ] . to have a better understanding of the physical nature of these low - energy raman modes",
    ", we also varied the temperature between 10 and 100  k , crossing the magnetic transition at t@xmath3=  27k .",
    "the spectra temperature dependence is reported in fig.[fig9 ] for two different polarizations .    at 10  k ( fig.[fig8 ] ) , an excitation around 12  @xmath10 , ( m ) , is always present whatever the polarization ( with a slight shift ) , at the same energy as the magnon observed by thz spectroscopy ( see fig.3 in reference @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore assign it to a magnon .",
    "this is further confirmed by its temperature dependence ( fig.[fig9])a : as the temperature is increased , it shifts to lower energy and disappears above t@xmath3=  27k    apart from this magnon , other excitations are present : at 29.4  @xmath10 and 47 @xmath10 for ( @xmath27//c @xmath28//c ) , and weaker modes are obserevd at around 45  @xmath10 , 50  @xmath10 and 62  @xmath10 for the other polarization .",
    "the mode at 29.4  @xmath10 , ( em ) , agrees very well with the electro - magnetic excitation observed in @xcite : at the same temperature , its electro active part is observed at 29  @xmath10 .",
    "it has been shown that its position does not change substantially with temperature but it disappears above t@xmath4=120  k. it is interpreted as a phonon mode associated to atomic rotations , occuring only below t@xmath4=120  k when a symmetry lowering occurs @xcite .    at even higher energy ,",
    "other excitations are present : at 47  cm  @xmath29 for @xmath27//c @xmath30//c , around 40 - 50 cm  @xmath29 and 62 cm  @xmath29 for the other polarizations .",
    "their temperature evolution is very similar to the electro - magnon at 29.4  @xmath10 : the excitation ( p ) at 42 cm  @xmath29 for instance ( see fig.[fig9]b ) remains at the same position up to 100  k while its intensity decreases substantially .    from all these low energy measurements ,",
    "we confirm that , below t@xmath4=120  k , a symmetry breaking occurs , with several soft phonon modes emerging in the 25- 65  @xmath10 energy range .",
    "this symmetry breaking is further evidenced through one narrow phonon mode , attributed to an impurity , responding to the local symmetry breaking and splits below t@xmath4 .",
    "from the comparison between ir , raman and theoretical phonons spectra , its is clear that the p321 space group assumed from x - ray scattering experiments  @xcite should be questioned .",
    "our work shows that the most probable space group is p1 , even if the symmetry breaking is expected to be weak .",
    "indeed , in the p321 space group , not only many observed modes ( 13 ) can not be assigned to the computed ones , but four modes ( at 273 , 503 , 868 and 884  @xmath10 ) detected in raman scattering as belonging to the the @xmath14 irreducible representation can only be assigned to @xmath31 or @xmath32 computed modes .",
    "these discrepancies lead us to abandon the 3-fold axis , and use rather c2 or p1 symmetries .",
    "the appearance of computed negative frequencies in the c2 space group suggests that the c2 symmetry is unstable and further symmetry breaking should take place , towards p1 symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , for a large number of modes , the p321 selection rules are nearly respected , showing that the symmetry breaking remains weak . indeed , using the bilbao crystallographic server one finds the maximum distance between the p321 and p1 groups to be only 0.0030 and",
    "the computed structural lattice distortion estimated at 0.0001 .",
    "nevertheless , this point group symmetry lowering is clearly not sufficient to account for all the experimental observations : five modes in the 640 - 770  @xmath10 range remain unaccounted for within a simple unit cell .",
    "since we excluded an impurity phase as the origin of these modes , one should thus break the translational symmetry and enlarge the unit cell .",
    "calculated phonons spectra in super - cells along the c direction do not however exhibit any sign of new modes in the desired energy range .",
    "the only remaining possibility is thus that these modes originate from an enlargement of the unit cell in the ( a , b ) plane , an enlargement present even at room temperature .    at temperatures lower than t@xmath33  k",
    ", we see additional low energy ( @xmath34 ) features in the phonons spectra suggesting a symmetry lowering .",
    "first principle calculations in triple - cells along the c axis exhibit new modes in this energy range .",
    "this result put into perspective with the fact that the magnetic unit under t@xmath3 is found to be a septuple unit cell along the c axis allow us to propose the following scenario : ( i ) at room temperature the system crystallises in the p1 group with an enlarged unit cell in the ( a , b ) plane .",
    "( ii ) at t@xmath4 it undergoes a phase transition further increasing the unit cell along the c axis , most probably with an incommensurate vector . then ( iii ) at the magnetic transition the latter locks to c=7c .    in this scenario ,",
    "the compound can sustain a polarisation , even at room temperature , both in the ( a , b ) plane and along the c direction .",
    "clearly this polarisation is expected to be faint and difficult to measure , as outlined by the weakness of the predicted symmetry breaking .",
    "since electric domains are likely present , the observed polarisation may vary from one sample to the other . at lower temperature ,",
    "when the magnetic order sets in , a coupling mechanism may enhanced the static polarisation that is further enhanced by a static magnetic field  @xcite .    finally one should point out that the loss of symmetry at room temperature implies that the polar state is not induced by the set in of the magnetic order .",
    "the consequence is that such crystals can no more be considered as magnetically induced multiferroics and thus the origin of their magneto - electric coupling should be revisited .",

    "<S> a static polarisation in the @xmath7-plane is present only if a symmetry breaking occurs , most probably from p321 to c2 , with the loss of the three - fold axis . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> a static polarisation along the @xmath6-axis is not allowed for c2 but possible for p@xmath8 , the other subgroup of p321 where the 3-fold axis is preserved and no 2-fold axis remains . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in the lowest symmetry , p1 , a static polarisation in the @xmath7-plane as well as along the @xmath6-axis is allowed . </S>",
    "<S> optical measurements should be particularly well suited to probe such a symmetry breaking . for p321 symmetry </S>",
    "<S> , the 66 optical modes , expected for this compound with 23 atoms per unit cell , consist in 22 e modes that are doubly degenerated , 10 a@xmath9 modes and 12 a@xmath1 modes . </S>",
    "<S> infrared ( ir ) spectroscopy can probe e and a@xmath1 modes while raman spectroscopy can probe e and a@xmath9 modes . </S>",
    "<S> in c2 symmetry as well as in p3 and p1 symmetry , all 66 modes are no longer degenerated and are all ir and raman active . </S>"
