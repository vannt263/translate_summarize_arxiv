    "an important feature of many complex networks is that they can be highly clustered .",
    "that is , such networks are comprised of well - connected modules , or communities , with weaker connections between them ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "part of the motivation for focusing on communities is that unraveling this substructure may provide important clues about how such networks are organized , how they function , and how information is transmitted across them . while identifying communities has become a standard diagnostic of networks  @xcite , and there has been much recent effort devoted to determine the community structure of complex networks , less is known about mechanisms that could lead to this heterogeneity ; for contributions in this direction , see , e.g. , @xcite . our goal is to develop a basic model for the formation of a social network in which highly - clustered substructures emerge spontaneously from homogeneous social interaction rules .",
    "thus there is no need to appeal to homophily ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) or some other explicit source of heterogeneity to generate large - scale clustering .    in our modeling ,",
    "the starting network consists of @xmath0 complete strangers with no links between them .",
    "this might describe , for example , a set of entering students to a university in an unfamiliar location .",
    "we assume that the population remains constant over the time scale that social connections form .",
    "there are two distinct ways that connections are made :    * _ direct linking : _ an agent with either zero friends or one friend links to a randomly selected agent . *",
    "_ transitive linking : _ an agent with two or more friends introduces two of them at random .",
    "these selected agents then create a link with a rate that is specified below .",
    "these two mechanisms underlie the acquaintance model that was introduced by davidsen et al .",
    "@xcite ; for related work see @xcite and references therein . in @xcite , the rates of these two linking processes were fixed and a steady state was achieved by allowing any agent and all its attached links to disappear at a ( small ) rate and correspondingly adding a new agent to the network to keep the number of agents fixed . in this work ,",
    "we impose a different , socially - motivated , mechanism that allows the network to reach a non - trivial long - time state .    a natural reason for distinguishing between direct and transitive linking",
    "is that an individual with many friends typically has less impetus to initiate additional connections .",
    "indeed , it has been previously noted that there seems to be a cognitively - limited upper limit  the dunbar number , which is of the order of a hundred  for the number of meaningful friends that any individual can sustain  @xcite .",
    "the threshold criterion for direct linking as defined above represents an extreme limit where an agent ceases to initiate new connections once he has two friends .",
    "nevertheless , it is still possible that a popular person will make additional connections as a result of being introduced to someone new .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the type of transitive linking employed in this work plays an essential role in many social networks , ranging from granovetter s picture of the `` strength of weak ties ''  @xcite to facebook , where users are invited to link to the friends of their facebook friends  @xcite .",
    "the key feature of our acquaintance model is the imposition of distinct rates for direct and transitive linking that are determined by the current state of the network .",
    "there are two different mechanisms that we implement to control these rates :    1 .",
    "_ threshold - controlled : _ when two agents , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , are introduced by a common friend @xmath3 , they connect if the number of their mutual friends @xmath4 ( inside the oval in fig .",
    "[ model ] ) to the total number of friends of either agent ( the degrees @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) equals or exceeds a specified friendship threshold @xmath7 .",
    "that is , a connection occurs between @xmath1 and @xmath2 if @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "rate - controlled : _ the rates of transitive and direct linking are defined as @xmath10 and 1 respectively .",
    "the use of threshold - controlled transitive linking is motivated by the observation that you are more likely to become friends with a newly introduced person when the two of you already have many common friends .",
    "the degree of commonality can be a useful indicator how much two people have in common .",
    "( solid ) with five friends ( open circles ) is selected .",
    "the selected agent introduces two of them , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( shaded ) . these become friends ( thick line ) if the ratio of their mutual acquaintances ( inside the oval ) to the total acquaintances of either @xmath1 or @xmath2 ( dashed circles ) exceeds a specified threshold .",
    "links outside this cluster are not shown .",
    ", scaledwidth=65.0% ]    in each update step of our friendship model , an agent is selected at random .",
    "if the degree of this agent equals 0 or 1 , the agent links to another randomly selected agent .",
    "if the degree of the initial agent is 2 or larger , a transitive link is created between two friends of the agent according to the rates given above .",
    "notice that direct linking joins two clusters ( here clusters are defined as the maximal disconnected components of a graph ) , while transitive linking merely `` fills in '' links within a cluster without altering its size . updates continue until no more links can be created . also notice that once every agent has at least two friends , cluster mergings no longer occur and links can be created only within a cluster . in threshold - controlled linking , the network reaches its final state when all the friends of any agent are either linked to each other or can no longer fulfill the threshold condition . in rate - controlled linking , the final state consists of a collection of complete subgraphs for any @xmath11 ; henceforth , we term a complete subgraph of a network as a _",
    "clique_. the case @xmath12 is unique , as will be discussed below . in either case ,",
    "a final state is reached because geometrical constraints ultimately prevent the formation of additional links .",
    "the most prominent feature of threshold - controlled transitive linking is the emergence of highly - clustered substructures over a wide range of threshold value ( fig .",
    "[ snapshots ] ) .    for small @xmath7 ,",
    "a new friendship is created nearly every time two individuals are introduced by a mutual friend . in this regime ,",
    "the resulting graph is nearly complete , but there also exists a small insular `` fringe '' population that is comprised of small disjoint cliques ( fig .",
    "[ snapshots ] ) .",
    "this fringe arises because once every agent in a cluster has at least two links , there is no mechanism for this cluster to merge with any other cluster .",
    "thus even in the limiting case of @xmath13 , the final state typically consists of more than a single cluster , each of which is complete .",
    "concomitantly , the largest cluster does not constitute the entire system for any value of @xmath7 . for intermediate values of @xmath7 , the networks",
    "are highly clustered , as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ snapshots](b ) and [ snapshots](c ) , with the largest cluster comprised of a small number of well - connected modules .    to help quantify the network and its clustering",
    ", we study the dependences of the average degree and the distribution of community sizes as a function of the threshold @xmath7 .",
    "the average degree exhibits a sharp change between a dense and a sparse regime for @xmath7 in the range of 0.20.3 for network sizes between @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ transition - w - threshold](a ) ) .",
    "we define the location of the transition as the point where @xmath16 , the average degree divided by network size , equals @xmath17 .",
    "according to this definition , the critical threshold value @xmath18 decreases very slowly with @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ transition - w - threshold](b ) ) . from the data",
    "alone , it is not evident whether a transition exists at non - zero @xmath18 for @xmath19 or whether this transition is a very slow finite - size effect .    a more direct way to understand how the network structure depends on @xmath7",
    "is by studying the community - size distribution . unlike real clusters , which are unambiguously defined ,",
    "the notion of community is somewhat fuzzy  @xcite . intuitively , a community is a community is a group of nodes that is densely interconnected and is sparsely connected to nodes external to the community .",
    "we adopt the definition given in refs .",
    "@xcite in which the communities of a given network are defined by the partition that maximizes the modularity @xmath20 , defined by @xmath21\\delta\\left(c_u , c_v\\right)\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath22 is the adjacency matrix , with @xmath23 if a link exists between nodes @xmath24 and @xmath25 and @xmath26 is no such link exists , @xmath27 are the degrees of these nodes , @xmath28 is the number of network links , and @xmath29 label the communities that contain nodes @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the first term in eq .   is the fraction of links within all communities .",
    "the second term gives the fractions of links that would exist within communities if all connections were randomly rewired subject to the constraint that all node degrees are preserved .",
    "thus the modularity is the fraction of links within communities minus the fraction of links that would exist within communities by chance .    to find",
    "the maximizing partition into communities , we apply the monte carlo algorithm proposed by blondel et al .  @xcite . in this algorithm , the network initially has the @xmath0 nodes in @xmath0 isolated communities .",
    "then for each node @xmath3 , we consider each of its neighbors @xmath30 and evaluate the gain of modularity that would occur by placing node @xmath3 in the community of node @xmath30 .",
    "the node @xmath3 is ultimately included in the community for which this gain is the largest ( and positive ) .",
    "once this step of assigning individual nodes to communities is done , the same fusion process is implemented on the current network of communities .",
    "this fusion of higher - order communities is repeated until no further gain in modularity is possible . at this point ,",
    "the algorithm gives the community size distribution , @xmath31 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ community - size - dist](a ) , the tail of this distribution , averaged over many realizations , decays as @xmath32 , with the characteristic community size @xmath33 increasing as the threshold is decreased .",
    "the data also suggests that @xmath33 diverges as @xmath7 approaches @xmath18 from above ( fig .",
    "[ community - size - dist](b ) ) . for @xmath34",
    ", communities are all cliques , among which the largest has a size that scales linearly with @xmath0 .",
    "this apparent gelation phenomenon is best understood by investigating the rate - controlled version of our friendship model , to be discussed in the next section .",
    "while the threshold - controlled friendship model leads to networks with visually striking community structure , many geometric and time - dependent properties are more readily understood within the framework of rate - controlled transitive linking . as outlined in section  [ intro ] , starting with an initial state of @xmath0 isolated nodes , nodes of degree 0 or 1 join to any other node in the network at rate 1 , while a link between two mutual friends of a node of degree 2 or greater occurs with rate @xmath10 .",
    "the process ends when the network is partitioned into a set of cliques .",
    "figure  [ final ] shows typical networks of @xmath35 agents at the instant when no nodes of degree 0 or 1 remain for : ( a ) @xmath36 , where the cluster - size distribution decays exponentially with size , and ( b ) @xmath37 , where the distribution has a power - law decay .    in the range @xmath38",
    ", rate - controlled transitive linking leads to the emergence of a macroscopic cluster at a finite gelation time .",
    "however , this gelation phenomenon is _ incomplete _ , because the fraction of agents within this macroscopic cluster ( also known as the gel fraction ) saturates to a value that is _ strictly _ less than one as @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ gel](a ) ) .",
    "thus in addition to the single macroscopic cluster , many small clusters persist forever .",
    "this behavior strikingly contrasts with classical gelation , where the gel encompasses the entire system when the reaction runs to completion  @xcite .",
    "the incompleteness of the gelation transition arises because the reaction is controlled by",
    "_ active nodes_those of degree 0 and degree 1 . when all these nodes have been used up by linking to other nodes , there is no possibility for additional cluster mergings . all that can occur is densification within each cluster .",
    "thus if multiple clusters happen to exist when active nodes are exhausted , these clusters will persist forever . in spite of this incompleteness feature",
    ", the gelation transition itself seems to conform to the classical mean - field description .",
    "as @xmath40 approaches the gelation time @xmath41 from below , the concentration of clusters of size @xmath42 , @xmath43 gradually broadens and changes from an exponential decay as a function of @xmath42 to an algebraic decay ( fig .",
    "[ gel](b ) ) . at the gelation time , @xmath44 , with @xmath45 , as in classical gelation .",
    "the gelation time itself diverges for @xmath46 . in the regime",
    "where @xmath47 , transitive linking events quickly use up all active nodes , which are the catalysts for cluster merging . because the average cluster size is still small at the instant when",
    "active nodes are used up , gelation is suppressed for @xmath47 . in this non - gelling regime , the cluster - size distribution decays exponentially with size at all times .     at fixed time @xmath48 for network of @xmath49 nodes and for the case of @xmath36 .",
    "the data represents an average over @xmath50 realizations .",
    "the inset shows the small-@xmath42 behavior.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we can make a more quantitative correspondence between rate - controlled transitive linking and gelation by mapping the former onto a version of classical product kernel aggregation  @xcite .",
    "this correspondence relies on our observation from simulations that the number of active nodes in a cluster of size @xmath42 at any given time is proportional to @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "the proportionality constant is time dependent because the concentration of nodes of degree one ( which we term leaf nodes ) nodes change with time . as shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ n1 ] , the contribution of clusters of size 1 and 2 deviates from the overall linear trend in the main figure .",
    "in particular , a monomer ( a node of degree 0 ) has no leaf nodes while a dimer always has two leaf nodes ( each of degree 1 ) . for clusters of size @xmath51",
    ", we assume that the average number of leaf nodes is given by @xmath52 .",
    "then the total number of leaf nodes , @xmath53 , can be expressed through the cluster - size distribution : @xmath54 . combining this equation with the conservation law @xmath55 we get @xmath56 , from which @xmath57     obtained by semi - analytical calculation of @xmath58 and @xmath59 obtained directly from simulations , scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "to develop additional insights , we now investigate our friendship model in the extremal limits of no transitive linking or infinitely rapid transitive linking .",
    "the former case may be achieved in the threshold model with @xmath70 or in the rate model with @xmath12 .",
    "the latter is achieved in the rate model by setting @xmath71 . in these limiting cases",
    "we can obtain useful insights about some basic network properties by analytical means .      in the absence of transitive",
    "linking , the network evolves by a constrained aggregation process that is mediated only by active nodes  those of degrees 0 or 1 ( fig .",
    "[ r=0 ] ) .",
    "the network stops evolving when these active nodes no longer exist . by enumerating all the possible ways that an active node can interact ( fig .",
    "[ r=0 ] ) , the concentrations @xmath72 of agents of degree @xmath73 evolve according to @xmath74 here @xmath75 is the concentration of active agents .",
    "one can verify that the conservation law @xmath76 is obeyed and that the mean degree grows according to @xmath77 .",
    "the rate equations admit an exact , albeit implicit , solution . to simplify the first two lines of eqs .",
    ", we introduce the time - like variable @xmath78 to recast these equations as @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath81 .",
    "the solution is @xmath82 consequently the original and modified time variables are related by @xmath83 equations  provide the exact , but implicit solution for the densities of agents with degree 0 and degree 1 .    to obtain more explicit results",
    ", we need to relate @xmath40 and @xmath81 . to this end",

    "thus the densities of active agents asymptotically vary as @xmath86 we estimate the time when active agents are exhausted by the criterion @xmath87 ; namely , a single node of degree 1 remains in a network of @xmath0 nodes at the completion time @xmath88 . from the above asymptotic dependence of @xmath53 , the completion time is given by @xmath89 .    to determine the density of agents with two or more friends , we define a second time - like variable @xmath90 to recast the last line of eq .",

    "first , notice that , by definition , the rescaled time @xmath96 . thus from eq .  , @xmath99 as @xmath39 , so that the fraction of nodes of degree @xmath100 at infinite time is given by @xmath101 the large-@xmath73 asymptotic is simpler to determine , since the small @xmath102 limit of @xmath103 makes the dominant contribution to the above integral . for early times ,",
    "one gets @xmath104 and @xmath105 as @xmath106 .",
    "substituting @xmath107 into gives , for @xmath108 , @xmath109    we may similarly obtain the average degree of the final network .",
    "we first rewrite the evolution equation for the mean degree as @xmath110 , so that @xmath111 .",
    "the mean degree therefore starts at zero and increases to @xmath112 as @xmath39 .",
    "thus when transitive linking is not allowed , the final network is sparse and only slightly more dense than a tree . [ for a tree of @xmath0 nodes , the average degree is @xmath113 . ]",
    "the complementary situation where transitive linking is infinitely rapid is also tractable because each cluster is always a clique and may thus be fully characterized by its size .",
    "the update steps for this limiting case are summarized by ( see fig .",
    "[ r = inf ] ) :    1 .",
    "select an active agent that connects to another agent in a cluster of size @xmath73 . if the initial agent has degree 0 , the cluster size increases from @xmath73 to @xmath114 , if the initial agent has degree 1 , the cluster size increases to @xmath115 .",
    "2 .   after each growth event",

    "keeping the two largest terms in equations for @xmath118 and @xmath119 , one finds the following long - time behaviors for the monomers and dimer concentrations : @xmath120 as one might anticipate , the concentrations @xmath121 and @xmath122 asymptotically decay exponentially with time . since these are the catalysts for the reactions of larger clusters , the network quickly reaches a final static state . by numerically integrating the master equations",

    "similarly , the average cluster size saturates to a finite value as @xmath39 .",
    "we now investigate whether our acquaintance model can account for the observed features of real networks .",
    "useful empirical datasets with which we can make such a comparison are anonymized facebook networks from 100 well - known universities in the us  .",
    "many of these networks exhibit significant clustering , although not to the same degree as in our acquaintance model .",
    "one possible reason for the stronger clustering in our model is the sharp cutoff between direct and transitive linking . in our model ,",
    "once an agent has acquired two friends , he no longer can make additional friends directly , a social interaction that would join two communities .",
    "thus the sharp cutoff between direct and transitive linking enhances insularity .",
    "however in real social interactions , individuals with many friends can still engage in direct linking , a mechanism that decreases the modularity and the clustering coefficient of the resulting network compared to our idealized model with a sharp cutoff .",
    "we are therefore led to define a `` soft cutoff '' model , in which the rate @xmath129 at which an agent engages in direct linking is a decreasing function of number of his friends , @xmath130 .",

    "the values of @xmath133 and @xmath134 give modularity and clustering coefficients close to those of the facebook example .",

    "[ model - data ] shows the values of @xmath136 and and @xmath20 from our soft - cutoff model as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "for the best match between the facebook networks and the model , it is necessary to choose @xmath137 to be weakly increasing with @xmath0 and @xmath7 weakly decreasing with @xmath0 , as given in fig .",
    "[ model - data](c ) .",
    "this comparison shows that our soft - cutoff acquaintance model can match the clustering properties of real social networks with reasonable and slowly varying parameter values .",
    "we introduced a class of acquaintance models in which macroscopic clustering emerges naturally from the underlying social dynamics instead of heterogeneity being one of the building blocks of the model .",
    "our approach is based on distinguishing ( i ) direct linking , where agents with few friends initiate connections with other agents , and ( ii ) transitive linking , in which two agents become friends as a result of being introduced by a common friend .",
    "we believe this distinction is crucial in causing the structures we see in real world social networks . by controlling the relative rates of direct and transitive linking",
    ", we can generate networks that range from nearly complete , with a tiny component of isolated cliques , to highly clustered , that are comprised of well - defined and well - connected communities .    from the perspective of simplicity and tractability",
    ", we primarily investigated a hard - cutoff version of the model in which only agents with zero friends or one friend can connect to others by directly linking .",
    "the rate at which transitive linking occurs can be either threshold controlled or explicitly rate controlled .",
    "both versions lead to highly - clustered networks near a critical value of the relative rates of direct and transitive linking . in the parameter regime",
    "where the long - time network is highly clustered , there always remains a small population of marginal individuals that are part of isolated groups .",
    "we also formulated and investigated a more realistic `` soft cutoff '' model , in which the rate that an agent makes direct connections is an exponentially decreasing function of its current number of friends . by tuning the softness of this cutoff , we can generate social networks whose basic geometric features , such as the clustering coefficient , the modularity , and the number of communities , quantitatively match those of networks from the facebook dataset .",
    "importantly , the model parameter values that are used to match with facebook data are fairly robust and depend quite weakly on @xmath0 .",
