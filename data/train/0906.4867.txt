    "graphene@xcite consists of a monolayer of covalently bonded carbon atoms forming a two - dimensional honeycomb lattice@xcite .",
    "low - energy electronic excitations in graphene are well described as massless dirac fermions with an additional pseudospin degree of freedom .",
    "because of the dirac spectrum , impurities can have a strong effect on the local electronic structure of graphene when the fermi energy is near the dirac point@xcite .",
    "impurities in graphene can be in the substrate , in the form of adatoms , or as imperfections in the lattice itself . in one hand , there has been very significant progress in decreasing the amount of disorder introduced in graphene , for example by fabrication of suspended samples@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "impurity effects have been explored to modify and tailor the electronic , thermal and chemical properties of graphene .",
    "examples of the later include experiments with graphane@xcite , chemical substitution of some of graphene s carbon atoms by boro !",
    "d nitrogen atoms@xcite , and doping of graphene with metals on top@xcite .",
    "since graphene is an atomically thin membrane , it can be easily accessed with scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) measurements .",
    "impurity effects can be studied with atomic resolution and the local spectrum can be obtained by stm spectroscopy .",
    "in addition , atomic manipulation can also be performed with stm .",
    "there has been several stm studies of graphene grown epitaxially on sic @xcite , mechanically exfoliated graphene on sio@xmath7 @xcite , and graphene flakes on graphite@xcite .",
    "in fact , stm experiments have proved instrumental in mapping the topography of corrugated graphene and determining the existence of charge puddles @xcite .",
    "additionally , stm experiments are also able to probe the chiral nature of the electrons in graphene when they scatter from impurities @xcite .",
    "this experimental work showed that intravalley backscattering is virtually absent in graphene .",
    "in particular , the stm experiment showed the lack of the @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the fermi momentum ) friedel modulation on the local density of states of graphene .",
    "as we show explicitly below , this lack of modulation can be traced to the fact that the local density of states at the @xmath0 and @xmath1 sublattices are out of phase by @xmath2 , an aspect already noted in passing previously @xcite .",
    "therefore , the local density of states , when averaged over the unit cell , shows no trace of the @xmath3 oscillation . additionally , as we show below , at distances @xmath8 close to the impurity , @xmath9 , there is a strong departure from the @xmath10 spatial dependence @xcite of the local density of states .",
    "moreover the form of the density of states close to the impurity is very sensitive to type of disorder : diagonal , non - diagonal , or vacancies .    in this work ,",
    "we present calculations of stm currents in locally disordered graphene .",
    "we focus on the case of chemical substitution ( by boron or nitrogen atoms , for example ) and use a multimode description for the stm tip .",
    "we obtain exact analytical expressions for the local density of states , and also present results for energies beyond the dirac cone approximation .",
    "we model the substitutional impurity by both an on - site impurity potential and local hopping disorder .",
    "we find that inclusion of the hopping disorder term leads to additional higher harmonics oscillations in real space for the density of states for the sub - lattice that does not contain the impurity .",
    "the main oscillations in the two sub - lattices are out - of - phase away from the impurity .",
    "for the regime in which the electronic hopping between the impurity and the nearest neighbor carbon atoms is decreased in relation to the hopping between carbon atoms in the clean system , the local density of states presents strong resonances .",
    "a vacancy is a extreme case of this regime .",
    "these resonances lead to the appearance of steps in the stm current , a signature that should be observable experimentally .",
    "these resonances also leads to open channels for tunneling between the stm tip and graphene , and lead to a decrease in the fano factor .",
    "another issue addressed in this paper relates to the effect of the tip on the measured stm currents . in the usual analysis ,",
    "the electrons in the tip are represented by jellium model with constant density of states . in this type of model",
    "neither the real part of the self - energy due to the tip - system coupling nor the variation of the density of states with energy is included ( wide band limit ) .",
    "the tip , however , is not an infinite metal .",
    "in fact it has a structure where the number of atoms in the atomic planes reduces as we approach the tip . in a previous publication @xcite",
    "we have modeled the tip as a one dimensional model ( in that work we have also considered the simplification of zero on - site energy at the impurity ) , which corresponds essentially to the case of a constant density of state too a good approximation . in that case we found the stm current to be symmetric around zero energy .",
    "when we generalize to the case of a multimode tip this symmetry is lost , as we show in this work . comparing the results of ref .",
    "@xcite with those given here it is possible to disentangle the effects due to graphene and to the impurities from those due to the tip .",
    "this work shows that some care has to be taken when interpreting the stm currents directly .",
    "the present manuscript is organized in the following way : in section 2 , the green s function formalism is presented , with analytical results for the green s function for graphene with a substitutional impurity , and for the stm tip modeled by a multimode system .",
    "local density of states results are presented in section 3 , and results for the stm current are presented in section 4 .",

    "in this paper we have studied the stm currents through locally disordered graphene . we have considered a tip with transverse modes . although the tip is strictly quasi - one - dimensional it still departs from the widely used model of a strictly one - dimensional model .",
    "generalizing now the calculations to a truly three - dimensional tip is reasonably straightforward .",
    "the modifications would require introducing a three dimensional square lattice for describing the bulk of the tip , and a decreasing number of atoms for each transverse plane to describe the part of the tip in contact with graphene .",
    "this last part would lead to the most significant change in the calculation , since the device would not be a single atom as in our calculations here , but would be represented by a finite number of them , and therefore the green s function for the device would be a matrix instead of a @xmath83-number .",
    "nevertheless , as long as we take the dispersion of the electrons in the tip to have large bandwidth , the current should not depend much on the local density of states of the tip , since this would be essentially constant .",
    "this corresponds to the usual wide band limit .",
    "we have also seen that tunneling through either impurity atoms , or their neighboring carbon atoms , depends on the local density of states of graphene . for certain circunstances  vacancy or weakly coupled impurities  there is a development of resonances at or close to the dirac point .",
    "these resonances lead to a strong enhancement of the tunnelling probability which appear as steps in the tunneling current .",
    "it is conceivable that graphene could be locally modified in order to take advantage of these strong resonances developed close to the dirac point .",
    "clearly the substituting atoms would also locally distort the graphene lattice , an effect not included in our description .",
    "how much the stm current would depart from the values computed here would depend on the change in the values of the hopping parameter , and on additional features on the density of states due to the disorder .",
    "if future research will pursue the route of modifying graphene locally , our results will be important for the characterization of the surface . even in the present state of affairs ,",
    "our results could be used to interpret stm current due to local impurities .",
