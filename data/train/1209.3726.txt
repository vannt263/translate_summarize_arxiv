    "the standard cosmological model based on the spatially homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric is very successful at describing many observations at different scales .",
    "it has become normal to include an inflationary epoch @xcite in this model during the early universe . although there is no direct proof that inflation actually occurred , and other scenarios should still be considered , the 1992 discovery of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background by the _ cobe _ satellite @xcite provided evidence of a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of primordial density perturbations of the kind predicted by inflationary scenarios .",
    "in addition , the study of these temperature fluctuations initiated by _",
    "ushered in an era of `` precision cosmology '' continued with later cosmic microwave background experiments , most notably _ wmap _ and _ planck _ @xcite .",
    "most models of early universe inflation are based on scalar fields , and those based on quadratic quantum corrections to the einstein - hilbert action ( `` starobinsky inflation '' @xcite ) can be reduced to the study of scalar field degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "a second revolution in cosmology occurred in 1998 with the discovery , obtained by studying type ia supernovae , that the current expansion of the universe is accelerated @xcite . in the context of general relativity , on which the standard @xmath0-cold dark matter model is based ,",
    "this acceleration can only be explained with a cosmological constant @xmath0 of extremely fine - tuned , but non - vanishing , magnitude , or with a very exotic fluid having pressure @xmath1 and density @xmath2 related by the equation of state   @xmath3 , and dubbed `` dark energy '' .",
    "most models of dark energy are based on a scalar field @xmath4 ( also known as `` quintessence '' ) rolling in a flat section of its potential @xmath5 .",
    "alternative scenarios , seeking to replace the einstein - hilbert action ( `` @xmath6 '' or `` modified '' gravity @xcite ) , can again be reduced to the dynamics of a scalar field degree of freedom .",
    "both inflation and quintessence models mandate a general understanding of scalar field dynamics in general - relativistic cosmology .",
    "furthermore , a scalar field provides the simplest field theory of matter , and although no fundamental classical scalar field has been discovered in nature so far ( except possibly for quintessence ) , they do provide a toy model useful for understanding many basic theoretical features of more realistic field theories , without the extra details and complications . as such , scalar field theory also constitutes an excellent pedagogical tool used in most relativity textbooks .    in this paper",
    "we approach the spatially homogeneous and isotropic cosmology of scalar fields minimally coupled to gravity from the phase space point of view .",
    "although dynamical system methods have been widely used in cosmology since the 1960s @xcite and this type of analysis has been performed for non - minimally coupled scalar fields @xcite and general scalar - tensor or @xmath6 gravity @xcite , we could not find in the literature a complete and self - contained analysis for the simpler case of relativity with a minimally coupled scalar field , apart from specific scenarios corresponding to particular choices of the scalar field potential @xmath5 , which abound in the literature ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite-@xcite , see also @xcite  the literature on specific scenarios is very large and here we limit ourselves to quote the papers whose approach is closest to the general one that we adopt ) .",
    "by contrast , here we do not commit to any particular scenario , and at most , we make general assumptions on properties of the potential ( such as boundedness or monotonicity ) , refraining from choosing specific forms of the function @xmath5 . given that there is no preferred scenario of inflation or quintessence , general considerations are valuable .",
    "since the relevant equations , which reduce to ordinary differential equations ( odes ) in this case , are still non - linear and not amenable to exact solution , the phase space view becomes important in gaining a qualitative understanding of the solutions without actually solving the field equations .",
    "it is generally believed that in order to say anything about the phase space and the qualitative behaviour of the solutions of the equations , one must first fully specify the scenario of inflation or quintessence being studied .",
    "while this is certainly true if one wants a complete qualitative picture of the dynamics , many aspects of the phase space portrait are common to most , if not all , scenarios and the study of these aspects , without committing to any particular scenario or potential @xmath5 , is a necessary preliminary for more detailed analyses of specific models .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss these general features , specifically the geometry of the phase space , the existence , nature , and stability of the fixed points , and the late - time behaviour of the solutions , without specifying the form of the scalar field potential energy density , and instead making some generic assumptions on its behaviour ( boundedness , presence of asymptotes , _ etc . _ ) .",
    "we consider a scalar field minimally coupled to the spacetime curvature as the only source of gravity in the einstein field equations .",
    "this assumption is fully justified in inflationary scenarios of the early universe @xcite , and only approximately justified in quintessence models of the late universe @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "scalar field dark energy is present along with a dust fluid , which combine to determine the dynamics of the universe .",
    "however , observations suggest that dark energy comes to dominate the dynamics very quickly , starting from redshifts @xmath7 , thus we can once again neglect the dust fluid and other forms of energy in the late regimes . in short ,",

    "to first order ( for which the gauge - invariant formalisms apply ) , the results on the stability of de sitter spaces already obtained also hold for inhomogeneous perturbations .",
    "in fact , the stability of de sitter spaces in the very general theory of gravity described by the action @xmath195\\ ] ] was studied in @xcite .",
    "this class of theories contains scalar - tensor gravity if @xmath196 and higher order gravity if @xmath197 and @xmath33const .",
    "a de sitter space @xmath125 is stable with respect to inhomogeneous perturbations if and only if @xcite @xmath198 general relativity with a minimally coupled scalar field corresponds to the trivial case @xmath199 which yields the first order stability condition @xmath150 .",
    "this result is gauge - invariant and reproduces , to first order , the one which we have already obtained for homogeneous perturbations ( the equivalence between homogeneous and inhomogeneous perturbations in this respect does not extend to flrw universes other than de sitter space ) .      the lyapunov method @xcite can be easily applied to scalar field cosmology in order to assess stability non - perturbatively , and to estimate the size of the attraction basins of stable fixed points in the phase space .",
    "let @xmath125 be a fixed point of the dynamical system ( [ eq : friedh - dot])([eq : friedkg ] ) ; then , if @xmath5 has a local minimum at @xmath92 , and @xmath155 , the @xmath200 function @xmath201 is a lyapunov function . in fact ,    * @xmath202 in a domain @xmath203 containing @xmath92 , except at @xmath125 ; * @xmath204 ; * @xmath205 is strictly negative in @xmath203 , except at the fixed point , where @xmath206 vanishes .",
    "therefore , the fixed point @xmath125 is asymptotically stable .",
    "if @xmath5 has only one minimum at @xmath92 , the attraction basin of @xmath125 is the entire phase space , while if there are other minima at @xmath207 , the attraction basin of @xmath125 is finite and will be limited by separatrices between the attraction basins of other fixed points .",
    "if @xmath155 and v(@xmath208 has a local maximum at @xmath92 ( with @xmath209 ) , then the @xmath200 function @xmath210 is such that @xmath211 in a domain containing @xmath125 at which @xmath212 vanishes , and @xmath213 except at the fixed point itself where @xmath214 vanishes .",
    "this guarantees that the fixed point is unstable and is a repellor .",
    "some conclusions on the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions at late times can be reached under certain assumptions on the scalar field potential , without fully specifying the form of @xmath5 .",
    "first , for spatially flat universes , eq .",
    "( [ eq : friedh - dot ] ) implies that @xmath215 , with the equality being satisfied only for the de sitter fixed points .",
    "hence , outside of fixed points , @xmath126 is always a decreasing function . assuming that @xmath57 starts out positive and that @xmath216 ( which guarantees that the energy density is positive ) , the hamiltonian constraint ( [ eq : friedh^2 ] ) shows that @xmath57 can not become negative because , due to continuity , it would have to vanish first and the trajectory of the solution in phase space would then cross a fixed point , which is impossible .",
    "therefore , if @xmath57 starts out positive [ negative ] , it remains positive [ negative ] .",
    "let us consider , for definiteness , the case @xmath217 since @xmath57 is bounded from below by zero and @xmath218 , the graph of @xmath126 can not cross the @xmath219 axis and we must have @xmath220 ( assuming that @xmath221 ) . since @xmath222 , as @xmath223 at late times so",
    "also must @xmath224 , or @xmath225 ( with @xmath155 ) at late times .",
    "the trajectories must asymptotically approach a de sitter attractor point .",
    "one possibility is that @xmath84 , corresponding to minkowski space .",
    "this could be a point at infinity , in which case the energy content of the universe gets diluted in the future expansion and the universe more and more resembles empty minkowski space . in general , for a strictly monotonic potential which is non - negative ( or otherwise bounded from below ) , we always have @xmath226 and there can not be equilibrium points . in this case @xmath227 at late times with @xmath228 due to friction ( in an expanding universe ) , and then also @xmath229 .",
    "the phase space orbit tends to a de sitter point @xmath230 , where @xmath231 is the asymptotic value of @xmath5 .",
    "a further consequence of the acceleration equation @xmath232 is that there can not be limit cycles as @xmath57 and @xmath4 would have to repeat themselves for periodic orbits , while here @xmath57 is monotonically decreasing and thus can not be periodic .",
    "the late - time asymptotics become much more complicated if the scalar field couples non - minimally to the ricci curvature @xmath12 or if it is a phantom field with the `` wrong '' sign of the kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "it is possible to partially analyze the dynamics of a minimally coupled scalar field in flrw cosmology , described by the coupled friedmann - klein - gordon equations ( [ eq : friedh^2 ] ) , ( [ eq : friedh - dot ] ) , and ( [ eq : friedkg ] ) constituting a dynamical system .",
    "it has been shown in the previous sections how the study of the geometrical structure of the phase space and of the stationary points and their attraction / repulsion basins can be carried out without specifying the form of the scalar field potential @xmath5 .",
    "limiting the analysis to spatially flat universes reduces the dimension of the phase space from four to three .",
    "further , the trajectories of the system lie on two intersecting energy `` sheets '' ( corresponding to setting an effective hamiltonian equal to zero ) given by the hamiltonian constraint ( [ eq : phasespaceconstraint ] ) .",
    "the two sheets correspond to @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",
    "there is no possibility of chaos in this space due to its lower dimensionality .",
    "the dynamics of non - spatially flat universes are described by orbits constrained to take place above the upper sheet and below the lower sheet @xmath235 for @xmath236 , and between these sheets for @xmath75 .",
    "any stationary points are necessarily de sitter universes with a constant scalar field , which includes minkowski space as the special case @xmath237 .",
    "these points were found to be stable for @xmath238 and @xmath150 , by both third order homogeneous perturbation analysis and lyapunov s second method .",
    "the size of their attraction basins is dictated by the form of the potential .",
    "the attraction basins are global if @xmath140 corresponds to a single sink .",
    "the possibility of limit cycles is excluded .    in an asymptotic analysis ,",
    "if we assume that @xmath57 starts off positive ( an initially expanding universe ) and @xmath239 ( enforcing the weak energy condition ) , then @xmath126 will remain positive for all times and all trajectories meeting these conditions will be asymptotically attracted to de sitter spaces .",
    "physically , this means that for these conditions the universe will always expand , with the scale factor @xmath17 becoming exponential at late times .",
    "stationary points could exist as an infinite limit in @xmath57 and/or @xmath4 for certain potentials .    from the previous results",
    "one can see that an flrw universe containing a single scalar field in general relativity has relatively simple dynamics .",
    "the rather straightforward discussion presented here needs , of course , to be supplemented by a more detailed study which can only be carried out by fully specifying the potential @xmath240 , and this is the limitation of the present paper . at the same time ,",
    "not specifying the potential makes our discussion completely general .",
    "an added bonus of the material presented here is its pedagogical value for a general introduction to inflation and quintessence models .",
    "we thank andres zambrano for discussions and hugues beauchesne for help with one of the figures .",
