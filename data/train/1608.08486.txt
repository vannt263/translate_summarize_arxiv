    "the results of these studies are :    \\(i ) we define and measure bao observables @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 that do not depend on any cosmological parameter . from each of these observables",
    "we obtain the bao correlation distance @xmath3 in units of @xmath12 with its respective dependence on the cosmological parameters .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish the bao signal from the background fluctuations due to the clustering of galaxies . to gain confidence in the results we repeat the measurements many times with different galaxy selections to obtain different background fluctuations .",

    "note that the external constraint from @xmath18 reduces the uncertainty of @xmath6 .",
    "\\(v ) the data is consistent with the constraint @xmath23 or the constraint @xmath7 constant , but there is some tension when both constraints are required .",
