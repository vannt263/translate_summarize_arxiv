    "they provide remote sensing analysts with accurate information about various earth events .",
    "satellite images are available in different spatial and temporal resolutions and also across various ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum , including visible , near- and far - infrared regions .",
    "for example , multi - temporal satellite images are extensively used for monitoring forest canopy changes  @xcite or evaluating sea ice concentrations  @xcite .",
    "the presence of clouds plays a very important role in the analysis of satellite images .",
    "nasa s ice , cloud , and land elevation satellite ( icesat ) has demonstrated that @xmath0 of the world s atmosphere is covered with clouds  @xcite .",

    "satellite images are a good starting point for monitoring the earth s atmosphere .",
    "however , they have either high temporal resolution ( e.g.  geostationary satellites ) or high spatial resolution ( e.g.  low - orbit satellites ) , but never both . in many applications like solar energy production  @xcite , local weather prediction , tracking contrails at high altitudes  @xcite , studying aerosol properties  @xcite , attenuation of communication signals @xcite , we need data with high spatial _ and _ temporal resolution .",
    "this is why ground - based sky imagers have become popular and are now widely used in these and other applications .",
    "the ready availability of high - resolution cameras at a low cost facilitated the development of various models of sky imagers .",
    "a whole sky imager ( wsi ) consists of an imaging system placed inside a weather - proof enclosure that captures the sky at user - defined intervals .",
    "a number of wsi models have been developed over the years .",
    "a commercial wsi ( , ) manufactured by yankee environmental systems ( yes ) is used by many researchers  @xcite .",
    "owing to the high cost and limited flexibility of commercial sky imagers , many research groups have built their own wsi models @xcite .",
    "for example , the scripps institution of oceanography at the university of california san diego has been developing and using wsis as part of their work for many years  @xcite .",

    "it projects the @xmath3-dimensional data @xmath9 onto a lower @xmath8-dimensional ( i.e. , @xmath10 ) feature space as @xmath11 by maximizing the captured data variance , or equivalently , minimizing the reconstruction error .",
    "pca can be represented as : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is formed by the principal components , which are orthonormal and can be obtained from the eigenvalue decomposition of the data covariance matrix .",
    "the objective function is convex , thus convergence and global optimality are guaranteed . in the field of remote",
    "sensing , pca is often used to reduce the number of bands in multispectral and hyperspectral data .",
    "it is also widely used for change detection in forest fires and land - cover studies .",
    "munyati @xcite used pca as a change detection technique in inland wetland systems using landsat images , observing that most of the variance was captured in the near - infrared reflectance .",
    "subsequently , the image composite obtained from the principal axes was used in change detection .",
    "* factor analysis ( fa ) * is based on the assumption that the input data @xmath9 can be explained by a set of underlying ` factors ' .",
    "these factors are relatively independent of each other and are used to approximately describe the original data .",
    "the input data @xmath9 can be expressed as a linear combination of @xmath8 factors with small independent errors @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the different derived factors , and @xmath17 denotes the @xmath18 row of the feature matrix @xmath11 .",
    "the error matrix @xmath14 explains the variance that can not be expressed by any of the underlying factors .",
    "the factors @xmath19 can be found by maximizing the likelihood function of the underlying distribution parameters . to our knowledge",
    ", there is no algorithm with a closed - form solution to this problem .",
    "thus expectation - maximization ( em ) is normally used , but it offers no performance guarantee due to the non - convex problem formulation . in remote sensing ,",
    "fa is used in aerial photography and ground surveys .",
    "doerffer and murphy @xcite have used fa techniques in multispectral data to extract latent and meaningful within - pixel information .    unlike pca and fa , which are unsupervised (",

    "lda is widely used for the classification of hyperspectral images .",
    "in such cases , the ratio of the number of training labeled images to the number of spectral features is small .",
    "this is because labeled data is expensive , and it is difficult to collect a large number of training samples . for such scenarios , bandos et al .",
    "@xcite used regularized lda in the context of hyperspectral image classification .",

    ", nca aims to find a feature space such that the average leave - one - out k - nearest neighbor ( k - nn ) score in the transformed space is maximized .",
    "it can be represented as : @xmath35    nca aims to reduce the input dimensionality @xmath3 by learning the transform @xmath34 from the data - set with the help of a differentiable cost function for @xmath34 @xcite . however , this cost function is non - convex in nature , and thus the solution obtained may be sub - optimal .",
    "the transform @xmath34 is estimated using a stochastic neighbor selection rule . unlike the conventional k - nn classifier that estimates the labels using a majority voting of the nearest neighbors , nca randomly selects neighbors and calculates the expected vote for each class . this stochastic neighbor selection rule is applied as follows .",
    "each point @xmath36 selects another point as its neighbor @xmath37 with the following probability : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the distance between points @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and @xmath40 .",
    "nca is used in remote sensing for the classification of hyper - spectral images .",
    "weizman and goldberger @xcite have demonstrated the superior performance of nca in the context of images obtained from an airborne visible / infrared imaging spectroradiometer .",
    "we now illustrate the effect of different dr techniques in the context of ground - based cloud classification . for this purpose , we use the recently released cloud categorization database called swimcat ( singapore whole - sky imaging categories database )  @xcite .",
    "cloud types are properly documented by the world meteorological organization ( wmo ) @xcite .",
    "the swimcat database consists of a total of @xmath41 sky / cloud image patches divided into @xmath42 visually distinctive categories : clear sky , patterned clouds , thick dark clouds , thick white clouds , and veil clouds . sample images from each category are shown in fig .",

    "pca and fa are often confused with one another , as they attempt to express the input variables in terms of latent variables .",
    "however , we should note that they are distinct methods based on different underlying philosophies , which is exemplified by the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : features - plot ] .",
    "the separation of features in lda is relatively good as compared to pca and fa .",
    "this is because lda aims to increase class - separability in addition to capturing the maximum variance .",

    "features based on sparse representation have been widely studied and used in signal processing and computer vision .",
    "different from dr , which provides effective representation in a lower - dimensional subspace , adaptive sparse representation learns a union of subspaces for the data .",
    "compared to fixed sparse models such as the discrete cosine transform ( dct ) or wavelets , adaptively learned sparse representation provides improved sparsity , and usually serves as a better discriminator in various tasks including face recognition @xcite , image segmentation @xcite , object classification @xcite , and denoising @xcite .",
    "learning - based sparse representation also demonstrates advantages in remote sensing problems such as image fusion @xcite and hyperspectral image classification @xcite .",
    "several models for sparsity have been proposed in recent years .",
    "the most popular one is the * synthesis model * @xcite , which suggests that a set of data @xmath9 can be modeled by a common matrix @xmath46 and their respective sparse codes @xmath11 : @xmath47 where @xmath48 counts the number of non - zeros , which is upper - bounded by the sparsity level @xmath49 .",
    "the codes @xmath50 are sparse , meaning that the maximum number of non - zeros @xmath49 is much smaller than the code dimensionality @xmath8 .",
    "the matrix @xmath51 is the _ synthesis dictionary _ , with each @xmath52 called an _",
    "atom_. this formulation implies that each @xmath7 can be decomposed as a linear combination of only @xmath49 atoms . for a particular @xmath53 , the selected @xmath49 atoms also form its basis . in other words ,",
    "data that satisfies such a sparse model lives in a union of subspaces spanned by only a small number of selected atoms of @xmath54 due to sparsity .",
    "the generalized synthesis model allows for small modeling errors in the data space , which is normally more practical @xcite .",
    "given data @xmath9 , finding the `` optimal '' dictionary is well - known as the synthesis dictionary learning problem .",
    "since the problem is normally non - convex , and finding the exact solution is np - hard , various approximate methods have been proposed and have demonstrated good empirical performance . among those , the k - svd algorithm @xcite has become very popular due to its simplicity and efficiency . for a given @xmath9 , the k - svd algorithm seeks to solve the following optimization problem : @xmath55 where @xmath56 represents the modeling error in the original data domain . to solve this joint minimization problem",
    ", the algorithm alternates between sparse coding ( solving for @xmath11 , with fixed @xmath54 ) and dictionary update ( solving for @xmath54 , with fixed @xmath11 ) steps .",
    "k - svd adopts orthogonal matching pursuit ( omp ) @xcite for sparse coding and updates the dictionary atoms sequentially , while fixing the support of corresponding @xmath11 component by using singular value decomposition ( svd ) .    besides synthesis dictionary learning , there are learning algorithms associated with other models , such as * transform learning * @xcite .",
    "different from synthesis dictionary learning , which is normally sensitive to initialization , the transform learning scheme generalizes the use of conventional analytical transforms such as dct or wavelets to a regularized adaptive transform @xmath32 as follows : @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the modeling error in the adaptive transform domain .",
    "function @xmath59 is the regularizer for @xmath32 @xcite , to prevent trivial and badly - conditioned solutions .",
    "the corresponding algorithm @xcite provides exact sparse coding and a closed - form transform update with lower complexity and faster convergence , compared to the popular k - svd .    in sparse representation ,",
    "the sparse codes are commonly used as features for various tasks such as image reconstruction and denoising .",
    "more sophisticated learning formulations also include the learned models ( dictionaries , or transforms ) as features for applications such as segmentation and classification .",
    "figure  [ fig : srfeatures ] provides a simple cloud / sky image segmentation example using octobos @xcite , which learns a union of sparsifying transforms , to illustrate and visualize the usefulness of sparse features .",

    "the octobos algorithm simultaneously learns a union of two transforms , generates the sparse codes , and clusters the image patches into two classes ( i.e. , sky class and cloud class ) by comparing the modelling errors @xcite .",
    "since the overlapping patches are used , each pixel in the image typically belongs to multiple extracted patches .",
    "we cluster a pixel into a particular class by majority voting .",

    "@xcite may further enhance the segmentation performance .",

    "we focus on three main applications : segmentation , classification , and denoising .",

    "in other words , unsupervised methods cluster pixels with similar properties ( e.g.  spectral reflectance ) . supervised methods on the other hand , rely on a set of annotated training examples .",
    "this training data helps the system to learn the distribution of the labeled data in any dimensional feature space .",
    "subsequently , the learned system is used in predicting the labels of unknown data points .    in remote sensing , k - means , gaussian mixture models ( gmm ) and swarm optimization are the most commonly used unsupervised classification ( clustering ) techniques .",

    "section  [ s : dr ] ) . in order to quantify the accuracy of the separation of data in fig .",
    "[ fig : features - plot ] , we use several popular clustering techniques in combination with dr techniques .",
    "we use two classifiers for evaluation purposes , namely k - nearest neighbors ( k - nn ) and support vector machine ( svm ) .",
    "k - nn is a non - parametric classifier , wherein the output label is estimated using a majority voting of the labels of a neighborhood .",
    "support vector machine ( svm ) is a parametric method that generates a hyperplane or a set of hyperplanes in the vector space by maximizing the margin between classifiers to the nearest neighbor data .",

    "using the @xmath44 training images for each of the categories , we compute the corresponding projection matrix for pca , fa , lda , and nca . we use the reduced 2-dimensional heinle feature for training a k - nn / svm classifier for scenarios ( a - d ) .",
    "we use the original 12-dimensional vector for training the classifier model for scenario ( e ) . in the testing stage , we obtain the projected 2-d feature points using the computed projection matrix , followed by a k - nn / svm classifier for classifying the test images into individual categories .",
    "the average classification accuracies across the @xmath42 classes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : classification ] .",
    "the k - nn classifier achieves better performance than the svm classifier in all of the cases . from the 2-d projected feature space ( cf .",
    "[ fig : features - plot ] ) it is clear that the data points belonging to an individual category lie close to each other .",
    "however , it is difficult to separate the different categories using hyperplanes in 2-d space .",

    "k - nn performs relatively better in this example . amongst the different dr techniques , lda and nca work best with the k - nn classifier .",
