    "the narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) class has come a long way since being identified by @xcite .",
    "there , they were defined as seyfert 1s with relatively narrow permitted lines ( @xmath6kms@xmath2 ) and a weak [ ] /h@xmath7  ratio ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the principal component analysis of @xcite found that nls1s lie at one extreme end of the eigenvector with the most variation in agn spectral properties .",
    "in addition , nls1s often have very steep x - ray spectra , placing them on one end of the anti - correlation between soft x - ray spectral slope and h@xmath7  fwhm seen in seyfert 1s @xcite and quasars @xcite .",
    "while work continues to identify the physical driver of eigenvector 1 , the leading contender is accretion rate expressed as a fraction of the eddington accretion rate ( @xmath9 ) as suggested by @xcite .",
    "this would imply that nls1s and some quasars are accreting at a large fraction of the eddington rate .",
    "this receives support from evidence that nls1s appear to have smaller supermassive black holes than many other seyferts , and yet have comparable luminosities ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and references therein .",
    "another type of agn suspected to have a large fractional accretion rate are the high - redshift quasars .",
    "these have much larger luminosities , and correspondingly larger black hole masses than other agn .",
    "one other property that nls1s and high - redshift quasars appear to share is super - solar gas - phase metallicity .",
    "the nls1 pg1404 + 226 has unusually strong absorption lines relative to ly@xmath4 , and x - ray absorption features , and this can only be explained by super - solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the strengths of the @xmath10 emission lines systematically stronger than average , and the @xmath11 were systematically weaker in agn with narrow permitted lines .",
    "this is similar to what appears in high redshift quasars @xcite .",
    "in addition , the strength of the fluorescent fe - k@xmath4 emission line in some nls1s is also thought to indicate super - solar abundances @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite noted that the steep x - ray spectra seen in nls1s eliminates the possibility of having a multi - phase medium with solar abundances . only if the gas is super - solar can it successfully form a pressure - confined broad - line region .",
    "metallicity , and more importantly , abundance ratios reflect the star formation history of the nuclear gas .",
    "this in turn might tell us about the particular circumstances leading to the activation of the agn .",
    "there are theories that link the many similarities between nls1s and quasars into a scenario stating that these objects are `` young , '' that is , the black holes have recently begun ( re-)accreting gas @xcite . in the case of narrow - line seyfert 1s , this is very likely , as the mass e - folding time is short enough to conclude that if that black hole had any similarly major accretion events in its past , it would not have the relatively low mass it has today .",
    "there are even suggestions that some nls1s do not fall directly on the @xmath12 relation @xcite .",
    "because nls1s could be part of an evolutionary track ( as opposed to the unified model ) , there is no a priori reason why nls1s should have the same star formation history , and thus metal abundance ratios , as normal seyfert galaxies .",
    "indeed , @xcite find that nls1s have significantly higher / ratios than standard seyferts .",
    "this result , however , is not confirmed in /.",
    "in addition , data on this ratio is based upon emission line ratios .",
    "a single emission line can originate in multiple locations , each with different physical conditions , complicating the conversion of line flux to column densities to abundance . if one wishes to get an unambiguous result , one has to measure the absorption lines . with this in mind",
    ", the emission lines results indicate super - solar metallicity @xcite , but require confirmation .",
    "we seek to determine the metal abundance of a nls1 using absorption lines .",
    "the largest contributor to the uncertainty in the abundances is the uncertainty in the photoionization correction",
    ". this must be well determined if there is to be any confidence in our results .",
    "historically , studies have contained few transitions and few ( sometimes only one ) species per element due to limited wavelength coverage ( e.g. only uv or only x - ray ) and thus do not have the leverage to determine the correct ionization model .",
    "our program consists of near - simultaneous observations of the nls1 markarian1044 with the hst , fuse , and chandra observatories .",
    "this long wavelength baseline ensures that we will have the range of species and elements to accurately model the ionization correction . in this paper",
    ", we present observations of mrk1044 with the fuv - mama instrument onboard the hubble space telescope .",
    "future papers will detail the fuse and chandra observations and the self - consistent model derived from all three s observations . in  [ sec : data ] we detail the the fuv - mama observation and data .",
    "we then follow in  [ sec : analysis ] with the analysis .",
    "we discuss the results in  [ sec : discuss ] and give concluding remarks in  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "mrk1044 was observed on utc 2003 jun 28 using the hubble space telescope imaging spectrometer ( stis ) with the fuv - mama detector .",
    "all observations were acquired during a single 5-orbit visit that ran from mjd 52818.19912 through mjd 52818.49349 .",
    "a journal of observations is given in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the 52x0.2 aperture and a clear filter were used for all observations , centering the aperture on the bright nucleus of mrk1044 .",
    "two low - dispersion uv spectra with the g140l grating ( central wavelength of @xmath13 ) were acquired during the first orbit , with a cumulative exposure time of 2311seconds .",
    "medium - dispersion spectra were acquired with the g140 m grating during the remaining 4 orbits at central wavelengths of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 covering the emission lines of ly@xmath4 , , and , respectively .",
    "the ly@xmath4 and regions were observed for 1 orbit each , acquiring 2 spectra per orbit for cumulative exposure times of 2734seconds each , and was observed for 2 orbits ( 4 spectra ) for a cumulative exposure time of 5583seconds .",
    "the standard stsdas calstis pipeline was used to reduce the raw data to wavelength- and flux - calibrated 2d spectra .",
    "the nuclear spectra of mrk1044 were extracted from the linearized 2d spectra ( stis `` x2d '' science frames ) using a 9 pixel ( 0.45 arcsec ) aperture using the spectroid centroiding aperture - extraction task in xvista .",
    "corresponding error spectra were also extracted from the stis error arrays for each spectrum and co - added in quadrature .",
    "these 1d spectra form the basis of our subsequent analysis .",
    "the g140l spectrum provides us with a reliable internal relative intensity calibration for the three non - overlapping g140 m spectra , and provides information on the overall uv spectral slope . the g140l spectrum with the flux - calibrated g140 m spectra superimposed is shown in figure  [ fig : masterspec ] . the individual flux - calibrated g140 m spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : threespec ]",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : masterspec ] , the uv spectrum of mrk1044 has a flat uv continuum with a slope of @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "its emission line features are similar to those of many other agn .",
    "most prominent are the ly@xmath4 , , and emission lines .",
    "less prominent , but certainly present are the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22,@xmath23+]@xmath24 , ] @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and ] @xmath27 lines .",
    "emission lines in general have a narrow ( @xmath28kms@xmath2 ) component and a broad ( @xmath29kms@xmath2 ) base .",
    "the presence of this base causes significant blending of ly@xmath4 and .",
    "the three g140 m spectra show a total of 26 possible absorption lines , all but four of which have good identifications .",
    "line identification proceeded from three assumptions : 1 ) lines near the rest - frame wavelength of a well - known and strong transition are likely due to galactic ism , 2 ) any or absorption line systems intrinsic to mrk1044 will also appear at the same velocity in ly@xmath4 , and 3 ) any remaining unidentified absorption lines blueward of mrk1044 s ly@xmath4 emission line , but redward of 1216  could be the signature of the low redshift ly@xmath4 forest .",
    "line doublets of and were identified by superposing velocity maps for each of the doublets . from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , we adopt a systemic velocity of mrk1044 of 4932kms@xmath2 ( z=0.01645 ) .",
    "velocity maps are shown in figure  [ fig : velmap ] for ly@xmath4 , , and . from these , we identify two absorption systems at @xmath0kms@xmath2 and @xmath1kms@xmath2 .",
    "we find that the two candidate absorption systems in at @xmath30kms@xmath2 and @xmath31kms@xmath2 are actually galactic absorption from @xmath32,@xmath33 in the case of the former and @xmath34 and an unknown absorption line superposed in velocity space in the case of the latter . in both cases ,",
    "no corresponding absorption system is detected in or in ly@xmath4 .",
    "we use two methods ( each with slightly varying analysis paths ) to measure the column densities of the absorbing material .",
    "the first is the standard curve of growth .",
    "more details of this process may be found in @xcite . to determine the velocity spread parameter , we calculate values of the column density for each line for b values of 10 , 20 , 40 , and 80kms@xmath2 .",
    "we then assume the velocity spread that gives the most consistent result between the line pair .",
    "the second method is the apparent optical depth method described by @xcite .",
    "this method is usable in well - resolved systems and thus it will provide an independent method with which to estimate the column densities .",
    "lines in each of the spectra were first measured approximately with the analysis package liner @xcite .",
    "best fit parameters for the emission lines were then used as initial guesses into the stsdas analysis package specfit @xcite . to determine the absorption line parameters via the curve of growth method ,",
    "liner was used with a local continuum parameterized by fitting a fifth order polynomial over a limited wavelength range ( e.g. only on one side of an emission line ) .",
    "a polynomial of order five was found to be a good balance between fitting the intrinsic structure of the continuum and letting noise introduce unphysical structure into the continuum fitting . in this manner , the local continuum and",
    "then two or three absorption lines would be fit and the process repeated for the next absorption feature .",
    "again , these results were used as inputs into specfit for final determination of the equivalent widths .",
    "the analysis of the lines using the apparent optical depth method proceeded differently . because estimating the continuum is the single largest contributor to the systematic error budget , we performed nine by - eye spline fits to the continuum around each group of lines .",
    "all nine were done as reasonable fits , but several were purposefully fit to the outer envelope of the noise .",
    "a mean was then taken of the nine resultant column densities with the scatter functioning as our measurement of error .      most of the metallicity studies of agn have been restricted to using the emission lines only .",
    "therefore , we give measurements of our emission lines to place the results of our absorption line study within the proper context .",
    "for each ion table  [ tab : emission ] gives the rest wavelength , the observed equivalent width , and the fwhm of the fit components .",
    "for most emission lines we fit both a narrow and a broad component .",
    "both the and emission lines exhibited an excess of red - ward flux which we parameterized with an additional gaussian .",
    "the + ] complex around 1400  can be parameterized with several narrow components and one very broad one , but these are so poorly constrained individually that we only report the gross properties of the complex .",
    "the literature contains many measures of agn metallicity .",
    "@xcite s figure 2 gives / and / as a function of @xmath35 at 1450 .",
    "mrk1044 has ratios of 0.6 and 3.1 , respectively , at @xmath36 .",
    "these values place mrk1044 right in the middle of the nls1 metallicity distributions , though this object is slightly more luminous than the rest of the nls1 sample considered by @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , mrk1044 remains at or above the mean metallicity - luminosity correlation .",
    "we can also place mrk1044 alongside the ultraviolet measurements of nls1s in @xcite .",
    "this object s /ly@xmath4 value of 0.59 is slightly higher than any of the nls1s shown in their figure 2 .",
    "mrk1044 s ( + ] ) /ly@xmath4 value of 0.17 is at the upper value bounded by their nls1 sample .",
    "finally , we can compare this object against the `` nitrogen - rich '' quasar q0353 - 383 @xcite and its recently discovered fraternity @xcite .",
    "one of the metallicity indicator used in these studies is @xmath37 , of which q0353 - 383 has the lowest value found to date : 0.07 . by comparison ,",
    "mrk1044 has a value of 0.45 , a factor of six difference .",
    "it should be noted that @xcite found a value of @xmath38-@xmath39_\\sun$ ] , which is only a factor of 2 - 3 higher than the value we will discuss below in  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "of the 24 absorption lines found in our uv spectra , 10 of these appear to be intrinsic to mrk1044 , organized into two distinct absorption systems .",
    "system 1 at @xmath0kms@xmath2 contains strong lines of ly@xmath4 , , and .",
    "system 2 at @xmath1kms@xmath2 contains strong lines of ly@xmath4 and , but has weak . due to their inherent weakness ,",
    "estimations of the strengths of the lines in system 2 suffer accordingly .",
    "table  [ tab : mrk1044 ] gives the measured and derived parameters for these systems : the observed wavelength , the observed equivalent width , the column densities derived both the curve of growth method and the optical depth integration , and the velocity offset from the systemic .",
    "equivalent widths are typically around 0.2  in the case of system 1 and 0.02  in the case of system 2 .",
    "the errors in the equivalent widths were determined by using estimates of the photon noise in each pixel .",
    "the errors in the velocity are set at 0.5 pixels , as given by the stis instrument handbook for cycle 13 .",
    "centroiding errors are much smaller and therefore ignored .",
    "when we calculate the column densities using the curve of growth method , we find that a velocity spread parameter of 20kms@xmath2 gives the most consistent result for both pairs of and lines .",
    "if we assume that this contributes the greatest to the width of the line , we can determine if these lines are fully resolved .",
    "the stis instrument handbook gives a nominal spectral resolution of 1.4 pixels .",
    "this corresponds to between 18 and 14kms@xmath2 in width at the lines of and , respectively .",
    "this is approximately similar to the preferred curve of growth width of 20kms@xmath2 so we will use that as our measure of intrinsic width . in the case of system 1 ,",
    "the fwhm of the and line pairs are 71 , 71 , 50 and 47kms@xmath2 , from blue to red .",
    "all of these lines are fully resolved . in the case of system 2 ,",
    "the fwhm of the lines are 90 , 100 , 43 and 38kms@xmath2 .",
    "the lines are close to being resolved .",
    "while the best - fit values of the line widths suggest these two lines are resolved , the large uncertainties prevent this from being definite .",
    "we calculate the degree of saturation of these two systems by measuring the ratios of the equivalent widths of each line doublet . both and have natural ratios of 2.0 .",
    "this can be used to derive a covering fraction ( @xmath40 ) for each system following @xcite .",
    "system 1 has a consistent value of @xmath41 determined from both the and lines .",
    "system 2 has less consistent values with @xmath40 of 0.97 ( ) and 0.94 ( ) , but this is not unexpected given the more marginal nature of system 2 s doublet , the @xmath42  line of which we only detect at about the 2.5@xmath43 level .",
    "we calculate / column ratios for systems 1 and 2 .",
    "we use the weighted mean for each species from each doublet . as table  [",
    "tab : mrk1044 ] shows , both methods find very similar results for the abundance , but the curve of growth method finds a systematically smaller abundance than the apparent optical depth method . this does not affect the / column ratios at the 3@xmath43 level . in system 1 , we find / ratios of @xmath44% and @xmath45% for the curve - of - growth and optical depth methods , respectively . for system 2",
    "we find ratios of @xmath46% and @xmath47% for the two methods respectively .      with good certainty ,",
    "we detect absorption lines of , ly@xmath4 , , , , and in our medium - resolution spectra and ly@xmath4 , , , and in our low - resolution spectrum from the ism of our galaxy . to determine the velocity spread parameter @xmath48 for the curve of growth method",
    ", we look for the most consistent result between lines of the same species .",
    "species for which we have only a single identified line we report a range of densities corresponding to a range of @xmath48 of 20 - 80kms@xmath2 .",
    "we also report column densities using the apparent optical depth method for all lines .",
    "we give the results in table  [ tab : galactic ] in the form of observed wavelength , likely identification , the candidate s rest wavelength , the velocity width , the observed equivalent width , the derived column densities for both methods , and the velocity relative to mrk1044 s systematic velocity .",
    "the velocities of the absorption components are scattered about zero and , in 12 of 14 cases , within three standard deviations of zero .",
    "it should be noted that there are systematic velocity shifts with respect to the parent spectrum .",
    "two of the g140 m spectra ( ly@xmath4 and ) have all their galactic absorption lines shifted to the blue , while the other g140 m spectrum ( ) and the g140l spectrum have their galactic absorption lines shifted to the red .",
    "this can also be seen , though not as clearly , in the lines given in table  [ tab : mrk1044 ] .",
    "these shifts are not statistically significant if one accepts the absolute wavelength calibration error of 0.5 pixels .",
    "the errors in the equivalent widths are estimated from the photon noise .",
    "most of the fwhms of the lines in the medium - resolution spectra sit between 50 and 70kms@xmath2 with a few lines @xmath49 ( the si lines and @xmath501548 ) . the uncertainty in the width is not taken from any specfit fit ( which claims a formal precision on the order of one - tenth to one percent error on any one measurement ) but instead from the scatter around the mean width measurement over many continuum fittings .",
    "this uncertainty is approximately 5kms@xmath2 for almost all lines .",
    "the triplet lines have the best agreement amongst themselves , all coming within one standard deviation of their mean width , 61kms@xmath2 .",
    "the lines have a mean width of 70kms@xmath2 and agree to within one standard deviation .",
    "the si lines have a mean width of 126kms@xmath2 and agree to within one standard deviation .",
    "the only real disagreement is from the lines which disagree at greater than three standard deviations .",
    "the galactic lines suffer from another problem .",
    "the velocities ( i.e. centroids ) of these lines are in great disagreement with each other .",
    "the uncertainty in the velocity given is that induced by the absolute wavelength calibration .",
    "wavelengths relative to one another in the same spectrum have their uncertainties smaller by a factor of 2.5 to 5 .",
    "this creates a disagreement in the centroids of the lines of more than @xmath51 .",
    "in addition , as can be seen from visual inspection of the spectrum ( figure  [ fig : threespec ] ) , the profiles of these lines are dissimilar .",
    "it is possible that weak absorption from high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) is preferentially altering the shape of the stronger @xmath52 line .",
    "this could also explain the large differences in the fwhm of these lines .",
    "this hypothesis , however , can not be tested with the current data and must wait for fuse confirmations of the existence of hvcs through the detection ( or not ) of .",
    "the three absorption lines in the g140l spectrum ( , , and @xmath53 ) have large widths of 920 , 560 , and 390kms@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "all are fully resolved .",
    "it is possible that what we identify as simply could also be blended with @xmath54 .",
    "this would explain the large width and would eliminate s large inferred velocity .",
    "unfortunately , deblending does not return a clean result , so we can not make this correction with any certainty and instead elect to omit it .",
    "the large values of inferred widths in the g140l spectrum is somewhat surprising , given that the low ionization lines seen in the higher resolution spectra are all so narrow .",
    "the cause of this is not yet known and we caution anyone from trusting the properties of these lines at this time .",
    "the four unidentified absorption lines fail at least one of our criteria . to be identified",
    ", a line must come from a strong transition of an abundant element without having a sufficiently large velocity difference .",
    "for example , @xmath55  could be identified with the line at 1263.5  but for the fact that this would give it a relative velocity of @xmath56kms@xmath2 .",
    "we also use additional information such as the fact that the line in question has a width of 52kms@xmath2 which makes it unlikely to come from si whose lines average 123kms@xmath2 .",
    "it is possible that the absorption lines near the ly@xmath4 emission line of mrk1044 are ly@xmath4 whose systems simply do not have the column to appear in or .",
    "the two unidentified absorption lines blueward of the ly@xmath4 emission line have velocities relative to mrk1044 s systemic velocity of about 2000 and 3000kms@xmath2 .",
    "while this does not particularly favor an origin as material intrinsic to mrk1044 , it is not inconsistent with that hypothesis .",
    "if these absorption lines are due to intrinsic ly@xmath4 , the inferred column densities are intermediate between systems 1 and 2 .",
    "unlike those two systems , however , these unidentified systems do not show absorption in either or .",
    "an alternative hypothesis is that these two systems are due to the low - redshift ly@xmath4-forest . to test this",
    ", we calculate the number of expected absorption systems from the results of @xcite .",
    "they parameterize the number of systems per unit log column density and per unit redshift @xmath57 as @xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 between @xmath61 of 12.3 and 14.5 .",
    "we calculate the @xmath62 detection limit of ly@xmath4 absorption to be @xmath63 .",
    "because this is almost a factor of ten lower in column density than the weaker of our systems , we reanalyze the spectrum for weak lines .",
    "our best continuum fit ( flattest continuum - divided spectrum ) can be seen in figure  [ fig : lyaforest ] . while any one continuum fit may produce several well - detected line candidates , we require any line to be well - detected in the majority of our nine continuum fits .",
    "only one additional line passes this test , being detected , on average , at exactly @xmath62 .",
    "the wavelengths , velocity widths , equivalent widths , calculated column densities and relative velocities of the two strong ly@xmath4 systems and the weak , newly found system are given in table  [ tab : lyaforest ] .",
    "for the decade above our detection limit , and for a path length @xmath64 , 2.0 systems are expected , and two systems ( within our column density errors ) are detected .",
    "the expected number of systems at all higher column densities ( @xmath65 ) and the same path length is 0.6 and we detect one . in this manner ,",
    "the attribution of these absorption lines to intergalactic ly@xmath4 absorption is perfectly reasonable .",
    "the / ratio does not tell us the n / c abundance ratio until we apply an ionization correction for each species . this ionization correction is the greatest source of systematic uncertainty in the determination of abundances .",
    "an accurate ionization correction requires measurements of multiple species of a single element , and preferably as many additional elements as possible . for this reason",
    ", we can not create an accurate ionization model with just this hst data .",
    "we are able , however , to set a lower limit on the n / c abundance ratio by calculating the / ratio in a region with physical parameters optimized such that the maximum amount of n is in .",
    "we invert the equation    @xmath66    where a(n)/a(c ) is the total nitrogen to total carbon abundance ratio ( henceforth n / c ) , the quantity we want to measure . following @xcite ( their figure 10 )",
    ", we find that has a maximum ionization fraction of 0.40 at @xmath67 of @xmath68 .",
    "the fraction of carbon in at the same ionization parameter is 0.31 . using our observed ratio of /=2.67 from system 1",
    ", this gives a n / c ratio of 2.07 , or 6.96@xmath69_\\sun$ ] ( @xmath70% ) .",
    "doing the same analysis with the weaker absorption lines of system 2 gives a super - solar n / c ratio of only 2.3@xmath69_\\sun$ ] ( @xmath71% ) .",
    "the errors quoted only incorporate uncertainties due to measurements derived from the spectra .",
    "to demonstrate the discrepancies caused by improper ionization corrections , we compute n / c for two alternative models .",
    "we do this by running the photoionization - equilibrium code cloudy94 @xcite with two differing spectral energy distributions ( seds ) : a power law sed with @xmath72 and cloudy s standard agn sed .",
    "we find that system 1 has an abundance ratio of 4.3@xmath69_\\sun$ ] in the case of the simple power law sed and 2.9@xmath69_\\sun$ ] in the case of the standard agn template sed .",
    "this can be compared with value of 6.96 using @xcite as above .",
    "the estimated error due to photon noise is only @xmath73% , which demonstrates that our result is dominated by systematic uncertainty in the ionization corrections , and more accurate results await data at other wavebands that should permit calculation of a detailed photoionization model for these spectra .",
    "until such a model is constructed , we are limited to stating only that mrk1044 has line strengths consistent with a super - solar n / c ratio .",
