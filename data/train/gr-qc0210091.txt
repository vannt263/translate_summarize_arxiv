    "the existence of gravitational waves has been predicted by einstein s general theory of relativity @xcite@xcite .",
    "starting with the pioneering work by weber @xcite one of the most challenging problems of experimental physics is the detection of gravitational radiation . in the seventies of the last century",

    "_ @xcite and dat@xmath0 and kumagai @xcite , and takao and shimada @xcite , respectively .",
    "below we will discuss only the measurements for the spring8 storage ring @xcite , though our results should be applicable also to other storage rings .    in the analysis of the influence of gravity on the spring8 electron storage ring dat@xmath0 , kumagai , takao and shimada have considered the changes of the machine circumference @xmath1 in dependence of gravitational coupling of the storage ring to the moon and the sun . according to @xcite , the change @xmath2 of the reference value of the machine circumference is defined by the gravitational interaction of the electron storage ring with the moon and the sun due to the tidal and seasonal forces .",
    "a total rate of a change of the machine circumference can be written as @xmath3 where first two terms are caused by the tidal ( m ) and seasonal ( s ) forces , but the third term describes a rate of a change of the machine circumference due to unknown sources ( us ) .",
    "the theoretical predictions for @xmath4 caused by the tidal and seasonal forces have been fully confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , measuring the rate @xmath5 of the changes of the machine circumference of the storage ring there has been found a systematic shrinkage of the machine circumference with the rate of about @xmath6 @xcite , which can not be explained by the tidal and seasonal forces induced by the moon and the sun . in ( [ label1.1 ] ) this shrinkage is described by the third term @xmath7 . in this letter",

    "we show that the stochastic relic gravitational  wave background , incoming on the plane of the machine circumference from all quarters of the universe , does not destroy the shrinkage of the machine circumference .",
    "the former is due to the fact that the effect of the shrinkage of the machine circumference is of the second order in gravitational wave interactions .",

    "it is well  known that on the earth one of the main fundamental effects of gravitational waves is the _ gravitational strain _ : a fractional distortion in the length of the object induced by the gravitational field @xcite .    in this connection",
    "we assume that the storage ring is sensitive to the influence of low  frequency gravitational waves , which produce a variation @xmath9 of the machine circumference @xmath10 .",
    "following @xcite@xcite we treat low ",
    "frequency gravitational waves as perturbations of the metric .    for the calculation of @xmath9",
    "we define a perturbation of the metric @xmath11 as a monochromatic plane wave traveling along the @xmath12axis with frequency @xmath13 and wave number @xmath14 @xcite@xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are constant amplitudes of the diagonal and non  diagonal components of the monochromatic plane wave , @xmath18 @xcite@xcite and @xmath19 is an arbitrary phase .",
    "we define the monochromatic plane wave in the so  called _ transverse traceless _ gauge @xmath20 ( see pp.946948 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "placing the storage ring in the @xmath21plane at @xmath22 the variation @xmath9 can be defined by the contour integral @xmath23 where we have used polar coordinates @xmath24 and @xmath25 and the relation @xmath26 ( [ label2.1 ] ) . a change of the length of a segment between two adjacent points of the machine circumference of the storage ring due to the _ gravitational strain _ caused by the monochromatic plane wave @xmath27 we denote as @xmath28 .",

    "walker metric , caused by the relic gravitational  wave background @xmath36 , a change of the length of a segment between two adjacent points of the machine circumference of the storage ring can be determined by @xcite@xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the radius of the universe at the present time . according to @xcite@xcite , the radius of the universe is equal to @xmath39 , where @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xcite",

    "this agrees with the value of the _ volume today _ equal to @xmath51 ( see @xcite , p.738 , box 27.4 ) .",
    "it is obvious that the contour integral of @xmath52 over the machine circumference of the storage ring should give the same variation of the length of the machine circumference as eq.([label2.4 ] ) : @xmath53 keeping the first non  vanishing contributions we obtain the relation between @xmath33 and @xmath35 equal to @xmath54 where @xmath55 .    since by definition of a perturbation , @xmath56 , the relation ( [ label2.7 ] ) gives a correct upper limit on the value of the real amplitude of the gravitational  wave background @xmath57 @xcite@xcite .",
    "a more detailed estimate for @xmath35 , related to the experimental shrinkage of the machine circumference of the storage ring @xcite , we derive below .",
    "notice that it is rather clear that the contribution of the gravitational waves to the variation of the machine circumference , @xmath58 , is of the second order .",
    "in fact , the mass quadrupole moment of the storage ring , located in the @xmath21plane at @xmath22 , has only two equal components @xmath59 . due to this , the interaction of this mass quadrupole moment with gravitational waves is proportional to @xmath60 , which is zero by definition for gravitational waves in the _ transverse traceless gauge _",

    "then , since @xmath56 , we get the lower limit on the frequency , @xmath75 .",
    "this corresponds to an oscillation period @xmath76 of the shrinkage of the machine circumference , which is smaller compared with the age of the universe @xmath77 @xcite . since the oscillation period exceeds greatly any reasonable interval of experimental measurements , the rate of the shrinkage of the machine circumference , induced by the relic gravitational  wave background , should be constant in time during any data  taking period .",
    "this agrees with eq.([label2.11 ] )",
    ".    we can also give a lower limit on the amplitude @xmath33 .",
    "according to the experimental data by takao and shimada @xcite , the oscillation period of the rate of the machine circumference ( [ label2.12 ] ) should be much greater than 5 years , @xmath78 .",
    "this gives @xmath79 and @xmath80 and according to ( [ label2.7 ] ) we get @xmath81 , the lower limit on the amplitude of the relic gravitational  wave background imposed by the experimental shrinkage of the machine circumference of the storage ring ( [ label2.12 ] ) .",
    "the rate of the shrinkage of the machine circumference , represented in terms of the relic gravitational  wave perturbations of the friedmann  robertson ",

    "in this section we give arguments against a possibility to explain the observed shrinkage of the machine circumference of the spring8 storage ring by diastrophic tectonic forces or _ diastrophism of the earth crust_.    there are major forces acting within the earth crust .",
    "they can be forces of _ compression _ , _ tension _ or _",
    "shearing_. they may be directly due to plate tectonics or caused by more localized or regionalized stresses .",
    "when these forces actually deform parts of the crust , the resulting landforms produced are said to have been formed by _",
    "diastrophism_. diastrophism can cause _ uplifting _ , _ rifting _ , _ doming _ , and _ tilting _ of regions of the earth surface .",
    "however , the major forms of diastrophism are associated with either _ folding _ or _",
    "faulting_. when these forces actually deform parts of the crust , the resulting landforms produced are said to have been formed by _",
    "diastrophism _ @xcite .",
    "since the shrinkage of the machine circumference can be identified to some extent with the deformation of the part of the earth crust , an alternative source of the systematic shrinkage could be , in principle , caused by _",
    "first let us estimate the value of the _ part of the earth crust _ which is undergone by _ diastrophism_. the area occupied by the storage ring is equal to @xmath141 with a radius @xmath142 .",
    "the deformation of this part of the earth crust leads to the systematic shrinkage of the crust to the center of the machine circumference of the storage ring . since neither _ faulting _ nor _ tilting _",
    "can contribute to this shrinkage , so only _ folding _ of the earth crust can be attracted to the explanation of this phenomenon .    indeed , _ folding _ occurs when rocks buckle or fold due to horizontal or vertical pressure .",
    "they are shaped into an arch ( called _ anticline _ ) or a trough ( called _ syncline _ ) , or they may override an adjacent fold @xcite .    however , the linear scale of the machine circumference of the storage ring @xmath120 is smaller compared with linear scales @xmath143 of tectonic forces providing _ moldings _ of the earth crust , which are of order of a few kilometers , and , correspondingly @xmath144 .",
    "of course , the global positioning system ( gps ) admits a measuring of motion of some parts of the earth crust with a velocity comeasurable with the rate of the shrinkage of the machine circumference of the storage ring which is of order @xmath145 @xcite .",
    "however , it is very unlikely that in such a seismic active country as japan a center of tectonic forces , leading to the shrinkage of the machine circumference , would be localized with a great precision at the center of the machine circumference during more than 5 years .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the observed shrinkage of the machine circumference of the spring8 storage ring , located in japan , can be hardly caused by diastrophic tectonic forces .",
    "it seems extremely incredible that the diastrophic tectonic forces , discussed above , would really be able to produce a longer then few  year lasting folding of the earth crust with the scale @xmath146 to the center of the machine circumference of the storage ring .",
    "thus , one can believe that the mechanism of the shrinkage of the machine circumference related to the gravitational  wave background seems to be more credible and probable with respect to any one caused by tectonic forces .",
    "in this section we discuss the influence of the forces , related to the _ stiffness _ of the physical structures of the storage ring , governing the path of the beam ( mounts of magnets , for instance ) .",
    "in fact , one can imagine that the forces , induced by the _ stiffness _ of the physical structures of the storage ring , can prevent the machine circumference of the storage ring from the shrinkage caused by the relic gravitational  wave background .",
    "if it is so this should mean that the observed shrinkage of the machine circumference of the storage ring can not be explained by the influence of the relic gravitational  wave background .",
    "below we show that the forces , related to the _ stiffness _ of the physical structures of the storage ring , can be neglected for the analysis of the shrinkage of the machine circumference , caused by the relic gravitational  wave background .",
    "let us denote the forces , caused by the _ stiffness _ of the physical structures of the storage ring , as @xmath147 .",
    "the observation of the fluctuations of the machine circumference , induced by the tidal and seasonal forces @xcite , assumes that the forces , produced by the _ stiffness _ of the physical structures of the storage ring , are smaller compared with the tidal and seasonal forces .    since the seasonal forces are smaller compared with the tidal forces but have been measured experimentally by the change of the machine circumference , it is obvious that the forces , induced by the _ stiffness _ of the physical structures of the storage ring , should be smaller compared with the seasonal forces .",
    "this can be written in the form of the inequality @xmath148 is defined by @xcite @xmath149 the potential @xmath150 , produced by the sun , is given by @xcite @xmath151 where @xmath152 @xcite , @xmath153 is the mass of the sun , @xmath154 is the distance between centers of the sun and the earth , @xmath155 is the radius of the earth .",
    "the rate of the change of the machine circumference , caused by the tidal and seasonal forces is of order of @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "the the experimental rate of the shrinkage of the machine circumference , @xmath157 @xcite , is of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this implies that the forces , leading to the shrinkage of the machine circumference , can be of gravitational nature .",
    "moreover , the forces , induced by the _ stiffness _ of the physical structures of the storage ring , governing the path of the beam , should be smaller compared with the forces responsible for the shrinkage .    in order to get a quantitative confirmation of this assertion we suggest to compare the energy densities of the seasonal forces and the relic gravitational  wave background .",
    "following @xcite@xcite we define the energy density of the seasonal forces and the gravitational  wave background as @xmath158 where @xmath159 is a period of the seasonal forces the relation @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is a characteristic frequency of the time  variations of the seasonal forces @xcite . ] .    assuming that the energy density of the gravitational  wave background @xmath162 should be of the same order of magnitude as the energy density of the seasonal forces @xmath163 , @xmath164 , we can get a constraint on the amplitude and frequency of the gravitational  wave background responsible for the observed shrinkage of the machine circumference @xcite . setting @xmath165",
    "we obtain @xmath166 for @xmath167 the relation ( [ label5.5 ] ) gives @xmath168 that agrees with our estimate @xmath169 given in section 2 .",

    "in this section we analyse the shrinkage of the machine circumference @xcite coupled to the relic gravitational  wave background treated as a stochastic system @xcite@xcite .",
    "we show that the suggested explanation of the shrinkage of the machine circumference , measured at the spring8 @xcite , by the relic gravitational  wave background survives even if the storage ring interacts with the stochastic relic gravitational waves coming from all quarters of the universe .",
    "this is related to the fact that the observed shrinkage of the machine circumference of the storage ring is an effect of the second order of the interaction of the gravitational waves with the machine circumference .    below we consider spherical relic gravitational waves @xcite converging to the center of the machine circumference , where the vector @xmath170 is the radius  vector of the machine circumference , located in the plane of the machine circumference @xmath171 , and @xmath172 is the radius  vector of the observer .",

    "walker metric ( [ label2.5 ] ) , we obtain @xmath212 where @xmath55 .    the r.h.s . of ( [ label6.10 ] )",
    "does not depend on the length of the the machine circumference .",
    "therefore , the rate of the shrinkage of the machine circumference should be universal for all storage rings with any radii .    from the comparison of ( [ label6.10 ] ) with ( [ label6.8 ] )",
    "one can conclude that the relation between the amplitudes @xmath33 and @xmath213 , given by eq.([label2.7 ] ) , is retained for the stochastic relic gravitational  wave background incoming on the plane of the machine circumference from all quarters of the universe .",
    "thus , within our phenomenological approach to the description of the stochastic relic gravitational  wave background the interaction of the stochastic relic gravitational  wave background , incoming on the plane of the machine circumference from all quarters of the universe , with the storage ring does not destroy the shrinkage of the machine circumference of the storage ring , observed in @xcite .",
    "formally , this is due to the phenomenon of the shrinkage of the machine circumference is of the second order in gravitational wave interactions .",
    "the results obtained above should be understood as a hint that experimental analysis of fine variations of the machine circumferences of the storage rings can , in principle , contain an information about the relic gravitational  wave background on the same footing as the storage rings are sensitive to the tidal and seasonal forces @xcite@xcite .",
    "we argue that if the systematic shrinkage of the machine circumference of the storage ring , observed at the spring8 @xcite , is caused by the influence of the relic gravitational  wave background , the same effect should be measured for the machine circumference of the storage ring of any accelerator , for example , the lep at cern @xcite , the elsa at university of bonn , the daphne at frascati , the vepp4 at novosibirsk and others .",
    "we have shown that the rate of the shrinkage of the machine circumference , represented in terms of the relic gravitational  wave perturbations of the friedmann  robertson ",
    "walker metric , does not depend on the length of the machine circumference and should be universal for any storage ring with any radius ( see eqs.([label2.14 ] ) and ( [ label6.10 ] ) ) .",
    "this makes very simple the experimental analysis of the validity of our hypothesis of the influence of the relic gravitational  wave background on the shrinkage of the machine circumference of the spring8 storage ring .",
    "indeed , it is sufficient to measure the rates of the shrinkage of the machine circumferences of the storage rings of the lep at cern , the daphne at frascati , the vepp4 at novosibirsk or of any other accelerators .",
    "if the rates of the shrinkage of the machine circumferences of the storage rings would have been found comeasurable with the value @xmath214 , obtained for the spring8 storage ring @xcite , this should testify the detection of the relic gravitational  wave background .",
    "any negative result should bury the hypothesis .",
    "we argue that the shrinkage of the machine circumference of the storage ring can not be related to diastrophic tectonic forces .",
    "then , since the value of the rate of the shrinkage of the machine circumference is comeasurable with the change of the machine circumference , induced by the seasonal forces , the influence of the _ stiffness _ of the physical structures of the storage ring , governing the path of the beam ( mounts of magnets , for instance ) , can be neglected .",
    "in fact , as has been measured by dat@xmath215 and kumagai @xcite and takao and shimada @xcite the forces , related to the _ stiffness _ of the physical structures of the storage ring , governing the path of the beam ( mounts of magnets , for instance ) , are smaller compared with the seasonal forces .",
    "we have solved einstein s equations of motion for the storage ring in the field of the cylindrical relic gravitational wave and computed the rate of the shrinkage of the machine circumference .",
    "we have shown that the rate of the shrinkage of the machine circumference , obtained from the solution of einstein s equations of motion for the storage ring in the field of the cylindrical relic gravitational wave , coincides with the rate obtained in terms of the _ gravitational strain_. in addition to the shrinkage of the machine circumference we have found a slow rotation of the storage ring defined by the non  diagonal component of the polarization tensor of the relic gravitational wave in the _ transverse traceless gauge _",
    ", @xmath216 ,    finally we have discussed the interaction of the storage ring with a stochastic relic spherical gravitational  wave background .",
    "we have shown that , since the shrinkage of the machine circumference is a phenomenon of the second order in gravitational wave interactions , it can not be destroyed even if one takes into account the contribution of the relic gravitational waves incoming on the plane of the machine circumference from all quarters of the universe .",
    "we have obtained an additional factor @xmath205 relative to the rate of the shrinkage of the machine circumference , induced by the cylindrical relic gravitational  wave background ( [ label2.11 ] ) .",
    "such a rotation has been obtained in section 3 by solving einstein s equations of motion of the storage ring in the field of the cylindrical relic gravitational wave . ] .",
    "this changes only the lower limit of the frequencies of the gravitational waves responsible for the observed shrinkage .    indeed , we get @xmath217 instead of @xmath218",
    ". we would like to emphasize that the factor @xmath205 does not influence on the upper limit on the density parameter @xmath219 , given by ( [ label2.15 ] ) and agreeing well with predictions of all cosmological models @xcite@xcite ( see also @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the upper limit on the density parameter @xmath208 is retained if @xmath220 , which is caused by the experimental fact that the shrinkage of the machine circumference lasts longer than 5 years @xcite .",
    "of course , the constraints @xmath210 and @xmath211 can be justified by the properties of the spectral density @xmath194 , defined by the theoretical model of the stochastic relic gravitational  wave background .",
    "one can suppose that in the case of the validity of our explanation of the shrinkage of the machine circumference by the relic gravitational  wave background , the constraints on the averaged frequencies of the relic gravitational waves can be likely used to set `` limits on a low  frequency cosmological spectrum '' .",
    "for the better understanding of the mechanism of the shrinkage of the machine circumference of the storage ring , caused by the relic gravitational  wave background , we recommend readers to consult the paper by schin dat@xmath215 and noritaka kumagai @xcite , suggested a nice physical explanation of fine variations of the machine circumference of the spring8 storage ring induced by the tidal forces .",
