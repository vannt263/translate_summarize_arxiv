    "as a result of gravitationally driven shocks and compression , majority of the baryons in the most massive , collapsed objects in the universe such as groups and clusters of galaxies exist in the form of hot plasma with temperature of @xmath3 k. these hot baryons manifest themselves by strong diffuse x - ray sources in the sky within the framework of bremsstrahlung emission , which are directly detectable with current x - ray instruments . on the other hand , the hot electrons in the virialized massive dark halos also scatter the passing cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons , giving rise to a subtle change in the cmb spectrum , known as the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1972 ) . unlike the x - ray emission of the hot gas in massive halos , which shows a strong dependence on the detailed structures and enrichness history of the hot gas as well as the distances of the host halos from us ,",
    "the sz effect is completely determined by the total thermal energy of the gas intrinsic to the systems .",
    "therefore , it is well suited for studies of distant , massive clusters , which may provide a stringent constraint on cosmological parameters especially for the mean matter density @xmath4 and the normalization of matter power spectrum @xmath5 ( e.g. barbosa et al .",
    "1996 ; molnar , birkinshaw & mushotzky 2002 ; komatsu & seljak 2002 ) .",
    "a more practical and powerful utilization of the sz effect nowadays is perhaps to statistically measure the angular power spectrum of the sz signals at various scales .",
    "this allows us to gain the weak sz signals at high statistical significance levels without resolving individual groups and clusters .",
    "indeed , recent detection of the excess power relative to primordial cmb anisotropy at arcminute scales has been attributed to the statistical signals of the thermal sz effect ( dawson et al .",
    "2001 ; bond et al .",
    ". a number of ongoing and future experiments will soon be able to provide a more robust measurement of the sz angular power spectrum at high multipoles or small angular scales .",
    "there are many other effects that should be corrected for before the sz angular power spectrum is used for cosmological purposes .",
    "these include nongravitational effect on the distribution and evolution of the hot gas inside halos ( da silva et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ; seljak , burwell & pen 2001 ; xue & wu 2001 ; holder & carlstrom 2001 ; zhang , pen & wang , 2002 ; komatsu & seljak 2002 ; zhang & wu 2003 ; etc . ) , possible asymmetric shape of dark halos ( cooray 2000 ; lee & suto 2003 ; piffaretti , jetzer & schindler 2003 ) , contaminations of radio point sources ( cooray et al . 1998",
    "; lin , chiueh & wu 2002 ; holder 2002 ; rubin - martn & sunyaev 2002 ) , etc . despite large uncertainties ,",
    "many attempts have been made over the past few years towards the evaluation of these effects on the sz cluster counts and angular power spectrum measurements . in this work , we will explore the contamination of radio sources in clusters in the measurement of the thermal sz angular power spectrum , namely , cluster radio halos and galaxies .    in theory of hierarchical clustering ,",
    "massive dark halos like clusters of galaxies form by gravitational aggregation of individual low - mass objects .",
    "sub - halo mergers will generate a considerably large number of energetic electrons that can be accelerated by cluster magnetic fields over cluster regions , giving rise to the radio halos due to synchrotron emission ( buote 2001 and reference therein ) .",
    "regardless of the debate on the acceleration mechanism for relativistic electrons in clusters , about @xmath6 of nearby , rich clusters exhibit radio halos , and this fraction may increase with redshift if mergers were more frequent in the past ( enlin & rttgering 2002 ) .",
    "furthermore , there is a strong observational evidence that cluster radio halos show a morphology similar to the diffuse x - ray emission from the hot intracluster gas , and the corresponding radio power is correlated strongly with the x - ray luminosity and temperature of clusters ( liang et al .",
    "2000 ; govoni et al .",
    "2001a , b ) .",
    "this enables one to estimate the distribution and evolution of cluster radio halos based on the well - determined x - ray properties of clusters .",
    "for example , one can easily derive the radio luminosity function of clusters at different wavebands and redshifts ( enlin & rttgering 2002 ) .",
    "together with the radio surface brightness profiles of clusters motivated by empirical formula ( e.g. @xmath7 model ) for the x - ray surface brightness distribution of clusters , one can estimate the radio background from the diffuse radio halos of clusters .",
    "existence of diffuse radio halos constitutes a major source of contaminations in the measurement of the thermal sz effect toward clusters .",
    "since radio halos always contribute a positive signal superimposed on the cmb sky , the decrements of the cmb signals due to the thermal sz effect of the hot intracluster gas at low frequencies would be compensated , while the increments of the sz signals at high frequencies will be correspondingly enhanced .",
    "the crossover point occurs at @xmath8 ghz .",
    "moreover , the amplitude of such a modification to the thermal sz signals depends critically on observing frequencies .",
    "this arises because the radio flux of cluster halos as a result of synchrotron emission has a steep spectrum of roughly @xmath9 .",
    "consequently , at very high frequencies the cluster radio halos may become hardly visible , and no modification to the sz signals from the cluster radio halos is needed .",
    "however , with the decrease of observing frequencies the sz decrements and the diffuse radio emission of cluster halos may appear to be comparable , and eventually the latter would become the dominant component in the microwave sky .",
    "this will lead to a nonnegligible correction to the sz measurement ( enlin 2002 ) especially in the central regions of clusters , because the radio emission is more centrally concentrated than the thermal sz effect if the radio emission is assumed to follow the x - ray emission .",
    "therefore , it deserves a close investigation of the influence of the cluster radio halos on the measurement of the sz angular power spectrum .",
    "another source of contaminations in the sz measurements is radio point sources , which include radio galaxies inside clusters and tracing large - scale structures of the universe . in a similar way to cluster radio halos",
    ", cluster radio galaxies also compensate the decrements of the thermal sz intensity in the rayleigh - jeans region . on the other hand ,",
    "the poisson distribution and clustering of radio galaxies on large scales would enhance the radio fluctuations , resulting in a positive contribution to both primary cmb and sz power spectra .",
    "the role of these field radio galaxies has been well addressed by several authors ( e.g. franceschini et al . 1989 ; toffolatti et al . 1998 ) , and the resulting contamination in the measurement of cmb anisotropies is found to be generally small or can be somehow removed .",
    "nevertheless , a significant fraction of the sz signals could be diluted by the unsubtracted radio sources inside clusters ( cooray et al . 1998",
    "; lin , chiueh & wu 2002 ) . using a toy model of radio point source subtraction , in which a certain central region is removed from all clusters , holder ( 2002 ) showed that the true sz power at @xmath10 can be underestimated by as much as @xmath11 at @xmath12 ghz . a more realistic model for the radial distribution of radio galaxies in clusters",
    "is thus needed to refine this estimation .    in this paper ,",
    "using a purely analytical approach , we perform a quantitative study of the contamination of cluster radio halos and galaxies in the measurement of the angular power spectrum of the thermal sz effect .",
    "it is hoped that such a study may clarify the issues of to what extent one has to take the correction of cluster radio sources into account in the cosmological applications of the thermal sz angular power spectrum . throughout the paper we will work with a flat cosmological model of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the change in cmb temperature @xmath15 in direction @xmath16 due to the thermal sz effect of the hot electrons in massive clusters is simply @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the number density and temperature of electrons in clusters , respectively , and the integral is performed along the line of sight @xmath21 .",
    "the angular power spectrum of the temperature fluctuation @xmath22 can be separated into the poisson term @xmath23 and the clustering term @xmath24 : @xmath25 since the clustering term @xmath24 is several orders of magnitude smaller than the poisson term @xmath23 at small angular scales @xmath26 where the sz power becomes dominant in the cmb sky , we will neglect the contribution of source clustering to the sz angular power spectrum . in the flat sky approximation",
    ", the poisson term can be calculated by ( e.g. cole & kaiser 1988 ) @xmath27 in which @xmath28 denotes the comoving volume per unit redshift and per steradian , and @xmath29 is the fourier transform of @xmath30 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the bessel function of zero order .",
    "we adopt the standard press & schechter ( 1974 ) formalism for the mass function of clusters @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mean mass density of the universe , @xmath35 is the linear over - density of spherical collapse that virialized at redshift @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the present rms mass fluctuation within the top - hat filter @xmath38 : @xmath39 in which @xmath40 is the fourier representation of the window function .",
    "we parameterize the power spectrum of fluctuation @xmath41 , and take the fit given by bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) for the transfer function of adiabatic cdm model @xmath42 with the shape parameter @xmath43 .",
    "the primordial power spectrum is assumed to be the harrison - zeldovich case @xmath44 .",
    "the amplitude in the power spectrum is fixed using the rms fluctuation on an 8 @xmath45 mpc scale , @xmath5 , which will be taken to be @xmath46 in this study .",
    "over the past few years , diffuse radio halos have been detected in a few tens of nearby , rich clusters .",
    "they often extend to a distance of @xmath47 mpc from cluster centers , and have regular shape , low surface brightness and steep radio spectrum @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , observations suggest that there is a tight correlation between the radio power @xmath48 and the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath49 ) of host clusters ( liang et al . 2000 ; govoni et al .",
    "2001b ) , which can be well described by the following fitting formula ( enlin & rttgering 2002 ) @xmath50 in which @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the present hubble constant in units of @xmath54 km s@xmath55 mpc@xmath55 . in order to set up a link between the x - ray luminosity and total mass of the cluster ,",
    "we first employ the best - fit @xmath49-@xmath56 relation of xue & wu ( 2000 ) , based on the hitherto largest sample of nearby x - ray clusters , @xmath57 it has been shown that such an @xmath49-@xmath56 relation exhibits no significant evolution at least out to @xmath58 ( rosati , borgani & norman 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "we then convert the x - ray temperature into the total cluster mass using virial theorem ( bryan & norman 1998 ) : @xmath59 in which @xmath60^{1/3},\\ ] ] @xmath61 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km s@xmath55 mpc@xmath55 , @xmath62 is the normalization factor , which will be taken to be @xmath63 in this work , and @xmath64 is the overdensity of the virialized dark halos with respect to the critical density of the universe at redshift @xmath36 .",
    "equivalently , one may also employ the empirical @xmath49-@xmath65 relation ( reiprich & bhringer 1999 ) incorporating with a simple model of cosmic evolution for dark halos .",
    "consequently , for a given halo of mass @xmath65 one is able to estimate its radio power at 1.4 ghz through @xmath66 radio observations indicate that cluster radio halos usually have a steep power index , which is also well motivated by synchrotron emission process .",
    "we adopt a spectral power index of @xmath67 ( e.g. giovannini et al .",
    "1993 ) to convert the radio power at 1.4 ghz to the radio emission at other wavelengths .",
    "furthermore , several observations have also reveled a similarity of the radio and x - ray morphologies in clusters ( deiss et al .",
    "1997 ; liang et al . 2000 ; govoni et al . 2001a ; feretti et al . 2001 ) .",
    "this enables us to model the radio surface brightness of clusters using the empirical fitting formula for x - ray surface brightness profile , i.e. , the @xmath7 model , @xmath68 in which the normalization factor can be determined by the total radio power @xmath69 at a given wavelength @xmath70 .",
    "meanwhile , the electron number density in clusters follows @xmath71 here we introduce the universal baryon fraction @xmath72 to fix the central electron density @xmath73 : @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the total gas mass within @xmath76 .",
    "the gaseous halo ( also the radio halo ) is truncated at the virial radius @xmath76 defined by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the critical mass density of the universe at @xmath36 .",
    "we adopt a constant value of @xmath79 for the @xmath7 parameter , and assume that the core radius @xmath80 of gas distribution is proportional to the size of the host halo : @xmath81 .",
    "we specify the proportionality constant such that @xmath82 @xmath45 mpc for a massive cluster of @xmath83 at @xmath84 ( cf . komatsu & kitayama 1999 ) .",
    "finally , radio halos are preferentially found in clusters that demonstrate violent mergers and substructures , which provide an accelerating mechanism for the relativistic particles responsible for radio emission ( e.g. buote 2001 ) . yet , the fraction of clusters that possess giant radio halos is still uncertain .",
    "following enlin & rttgering ( 2002 ) , we adopt a constant radio halo fraction of @xmath85 .",
    "nevertheless , we will also demonstrate the result for a fraction of unity for comparison . recall that cluster mergers may occur more frequently in the past than at the present .      in the rayleigh - jeans region ,",
    "the presence of radio halos can dilute the thermal sz signals towards clusters .",
    "the significance of the effect depends critically on working frequencies .",
    "recall that radio emission of clusters has a steep power spectrum of @xmath86 . at very low frequencies ,",
    "the decrements of the cmb temperature due to the sz effect could be completely compensated ( enlin 2002 ) by cluster radio halos . here",
    "we demonstrate the radio halo contamination using an observing frequency of @xmath12 ghz .",
    "the change in the cmb temperature is related to the intensity fluctuations by @xmath87 where @xmath88 .",

    "the radio halo contamination in the sz angular power spectrum arises mainly from clusters at @xmath100 .",

    "we show the contributions of cluster radio halos with different cluster masses to the thermal sz angular power spectrum . at large angular scales below @xmath102 ,",
    "the radio contamination is governed by nearby , massive clusters , which can be easily removed from the sz map because of their rarity . at smaller angular scales beyond @xmath103 ,",
    "the contamination arises mainly from moderately rich clusters at higher redshifts @xmath104 .",

    "we have also shown in table 1 how our estimates are affected by the uncertainties associated with the measurements of radio power , x - ray luminosities and total masses of clusters . to do this",
    ", we simply vary the radio power @xmath69 , x - ray luminosity @xmath110 and normalization factor @xmath111 in the virial theorem by @xmath0 , @xmath0 and @xmath11 , respectively , which are roughly representative of the uncertainties in current determinations of these quantities .",

    "<S> we present a quantitative estimate of the confusion of cluster radio halos and galaxies in the measurement of the angular power spectrum of the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect . to achieve the goal </S>",
    "<S> , we use a purely analytic approach to both radio sources and dark matter of clusters by incorporating empirical models and observational facts together with some theoretical considerations . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the correction of cluster radio halos and galaxies to the measurement of the thermal sz angular power spectrum is no more than @xmath0 at @xmath1 for observing frequencies @xmath2 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> this eliminates the concern that the sz measurement may be seriously contaminated by the existence of cluster radio sources . </S>"
