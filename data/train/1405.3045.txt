    "the motion of charged particles in the crystal along the channels formed by parallel atomic rows or planes was predicted by american scientists m.t .",

    "oen in 1961 @xcite and was discovered by several groups of scientists in 1963  1965 .",
    "channeling has served as the base for development of new experimental methods of research on the crystal properties and structure and some nuclear phenomena .",
    "new sources of x - ray and gamma rays which consist of electrons or positrons accelerators and precisely oriented crystals of germanium , silicon and other elements are based on the principles of channeling .",
    "channeling of ions is used recently for direct detections of weakly interacting massive particles @xcite .",
    "considerably attention has been attracted currently to study the carbon nanotubes properties by use of channeling .    at interaction between the channeled particle and a crystal the electromagnetic radiation is generated . in the framework of classical electrodynamics",
    "one can consider this radiation as radiation from different sources , such as radiation of the channeled particle , which is investigated in details in many papers and books @xcite , radiation of the electronic gas ( wake trace ) @xcite and the less studied radiation of excited atoms in the crystal lattice .    when channeling , the charged particle transmits part of its transverse momentum to the surrounding atoms .",
    "this excites vibration of atomic chains .",
    "oscillations of a nucleus with interior electrons cause time - dependent polarization of atom and hence electromagnetic radiation .",
    "this phenomenon is similar to the vibrational excitation of molecules and causes respective radiation .",
    "the phases of oscillations of atoms correlate between themselves as oscillations are excited by the same channeled particle .",
    "therefore radiation should be considered as coherent .",
    "assumption of such radiation was expressed recently in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the basic part of radiation is generated into a cone around the direction of velocity of a relativistic channeling particle .",
    "correlation between the fields of atomic radiation and radiation of the channeled particle was discussed in @xcite .    in this paper , we study the field of oscillating atoms in detail and calculate the emission spectrum of the atomic chains , excited by a channeled particle . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we discuss some of the features of the radiation field of the atomic chains , which were not taken into account in @xcite .",
    "the next section presents the calculation of the spectral and angular distribution of the radiation of the atomic chain .",
    "the last section [ sec4 ] is devoted to the calculation and construction of the emission spectrum of atomic chain .",
    "here we consider the electric field of the radiation of the oscillating atoms in a crystal .",
    "following @xcite , we consider the simplest model of the crystal lattice , consisting of two atomic rows with a channeled particle moving between the rows .",
    "of course , such a model is a rather crude approximation of the real crystal , but it allows to identify the characteristics of the phenomenon .",
    "we are encouraged by the fact that in due time the normal modes of vibrations in the crystal were investigated by use of one - dimensional crystal lattice .",
    "two - dimensional model of the crystal lattice is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the electric field @xmath0 of the radiation of oscillating atoms of lattice is described by the equation ( 33 ) in @xcite .",
    "let us rewrite this equation in the complex form [ eott2 ] e(t)=a_0 ^ 2\\{+ } , for @xmath1 and [ eott3 ] e(t)=a_0 ^ 2 e^it\\{+ } , for @xmath2 . here",

    ". angles @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the spherical coordinate system are shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",

    "the average velocity of a particle is directed along the axis @xmath18 .",
    "the particle enters the crystal at @xmath19 and leave it at @xmath20 .",
    "the excited atoms of the crystal lattice are oscillating along axis @xmath21 with frequency @xmath22 .",
    "the amplitude of vibrations decreases with time as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the attenuation coefficient . in the spherical",
    "coordinates vector of the radiation field @xmath25 has only one component : @xmath26 .",
    "we see from ( [ eott2 ] ) and ( [ eott3 ] ) that radiation is generated on two frequencies , namely on frequency @xmath22 of atoms oscillations and on the frequency @xmath27 which is frequency of oscillations of the channeling particle shifted by the doppler effect .",
    "the part of the field oscillating with frequency @xmath22 vanishes exponentially in time as @xmath28 , while the field of frequency @xmath27 is constant in amplitude . in case of long enough crystal , when the length of a crystal is much greater then the `` wake tail '' of atoms exited by the channeling particle ( @xmath29 ) , the part of radiation with frequency @xmath27 makes much greater contribution to the total energy of radiation .",
    "further we consider only this part of radiation . taking the real part of equation ( [ eott2 ] )",
    "we obtain    [ eott5 ] e(t)&= & - + & & \\{2^3t + t}.    this field has some features typical for the field of relativistic charged particle though the radiation is caused by non - relativistic vibrating atoms .",
    "first , the multiple @xmath30 in denominator of @xmath31 shows that the main part of radiation is concentrated around the direction of the particle velocity @xmath32 .",
    "second , the frequency of radiation @xmath27 is just the same as the frequency of the relativistic channeling particle .",
    "coherence of radiation is expressed by the factor @xmath9 in denominator of @xmath31 .",
    "it shows that intensity of radiation is proportional to the square of linear charge density @xmath33 .",
    "denominator of ( [ eott5 ] ) is of typical resonant character .",
    "indeed , if attenuation of atomic vibrations vanishes ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 , the electric field defined by the above equation tends to infinity .",
    "let us calculate spectral and angular distribution of the radiation field ( [ eott2 ] ) and ( [ eott3 ] ) of the atoms .",
    "we find the fourier integral [ furie1 ] e(_1)=_-^e^i_1 te_r(t)dt , where @xmath36 is the frequency of radiation , @xmath37 $ ] is the real part of the field ( [ eott2 ] ) and ( [ eott3 ] ) . in order to simplify the result of integration , we assume that the channeled particle makes an integer number of oscillations @xmath38 in crystal",
    ". then @xmath39 , and some exponents can be simplified : @xmath40 the result of integration looks like follows : [ furie0 ] e(_1)=.    spectral and angular distribution of energy @xmath41 emitted into solid angle @xmath42 and frequency interval @xmath43 is defined by the formula @xcite : [ spugl ] = |e(_1)|^2 . taking the square of module @xmath44 and substituting it in the last equation",
    "we obtain : [ sp - ug ] = e_0i_1(,,)i_2 ( ) , where @xmath45 is a constant , and `` tilde '' denotes the reduced variables : @xmath46 function @xmath47 depends on the angles and parameters of the channelled particle [ i_1nonrel ] i_1(,,)=. in case of large @xmath38 this function demonstrates the resonant amplification of coherent atomic vibrations at the reduced frequency @xmath48 .",
    "function @xmath49 depends only on the reduced frequency .",
    "it has sharp maximum at @xmath50 if @xmath24 is small enough [ funi_2 ] i_2()=.    the multiplier @xmath51 in denominator of ( [ i_1nonrel ] ) shows that in case of ultrarelativistic channelled particle , the function @xmath52 is relative great at small angles around the direction of the velocity . in ultrarelativistic case",
    "@xmath53 it is more convenient to describe the angular distribution in terms of angles @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) which depend on @xmath13 and @xmath14 as follows : [ newangl ] = , ^2=^2+^2 ^ 2 .",
    "we expand @xmath52 with respect to small @xmath54 and @xmath56 and denote @xmath57 .",
    "then we have instead of ( [ i_1nonrel ] ) [ i_1rel ] i_1(,)= , with @xmath58    figure [ i_1 ] shows behaviour of function @xmath59 at the following parameters : @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    ".,width=384 ]    the plot constitutes a ridge laying above the line @xmath62 in the plane ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the width of the ridge is inversely related to the number of oscillations @xmath38 and the maximum of @xmath52 is in direct proportion to @xmath38 .",
    "figure [ i_2 ] represents the function @xmath49 for @xmath64 in the some coordinates .",
    "it follows from ( [ funi_2 ] ) that in case of small @xmath24 the maximum of the function is inversely proportional to @xmath65 and the width of the peak is proportional to @xmath24 .",
    ".,width=384 ]    figure [ intersec ] depicts the product @xmath66 which ( according to ( [ sp - ug ] ) ) is up to a scaling factor the energy radiated per unit frequency per unit solid angle .",
    "the narrow strong pick lies at intersection of lines @xmath50 and @xmath62 in the plane ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "such intersection is possible only if @xmath67 .",
    ".,width=384 ]    in case @xmath68 the function @xmath69 has complicated structure as shown in figure  [ intersec1 ] .",
    "the maximum value in this case is about one order of magnitude less than in figure  [ intersec ] .",
    ".,width=384 ]    let us calculate the angular distribution .",
    "integration of ( [ sp - ug ] ) over frequency @xmath36 can be simplified in case of large @xmath38 .",
    "it is easy to check that the function @xmath70 @xmath71 possess next properties @xmath72 hence , it can be replaced by sum of the delta functions @xmath73.\\ ] ] integrating ( [ sp - ug ] ) under assumption that @xmath38 is great , we obtain the angular distribution of energy , emitted by the atomic chain [ ugl ] & = & + & & .    expression ( [ ugl ] ) coincides with ( 35 ) in @xcite for the radiation intensity , because the intensity and energy of radiation are bound by equation @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "in order to calculate the emission spectrum we integrate ( [ sp - ug ] ) over the solid angle @xmath75 .",
    "integration is better done in the spherical coordinates system @xmath76 ) ( see ( [ newangl ] ) and figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we denote the ratio @xmath77 .",
    "integral over the solid angle @xmath78 can be expressed as integral over @xmath55 and @xmath79 .",
    "the limits of integration over @xmath79 are equal to : [ lim ] _",
    "1(1- ) , _ 2(1 + ) .",
    "again , we use the approximation of great @xmath38 and replace @xmath80/(\\xi^2 - 1)^2 $ ] by the sum of @xmath81 functions according to ( [ d_func ] ) . the expression @xmath82 , if a @xmath81 function is inside the limits of integration ( [ lim ] ) .",
    "it means that the radiation lies in the frequency range @xmath83 integrating ( [ sp - ug ] ) , we obtain the final version for the emission spectrum of the atomic chain :    [ spectrum2 ] = i_2 ( ) .",
    "the last formula shows that the shape of the emission spectrum does not depend on @xmath36 but only on the ratio of frequencies @xmath84 .    as an example",
    ", we plot the spectrum for the following parameters : @xmath85 .",
    "the emission spectrum lies in the range _",
    "min==0.7510 ^ -4 , + _",
    "max=2 ^ 2=3.emission spectrum of atomic chain excited by the channeled particle for these parameters is shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "coherent radiation of atoms , which is discussed in this article expresses a sharp peak at @xmath86 .",
    "the width of this peak depends on the ratio of @xmath87 : the smaller @xmath88 the sharper peak in the spectrum .",
    "the rise at low frequencies due to the factor @xmath89 in denominator of the formula ( [ spectrum2 ] ) . note that @xmath90 can not be zero , because it is limited to a minimum value @xmath91 .",
    "at first glance , radiation of atoms exited by a channeled particle and vibrating in the points of crystal lattice is negligible small because of small amplitude and small frequency of vibrations , that is a consequence of relatively great mass of atoms .",
    "but if we take into account the great number of atoms which are involved in coherent oscillations excited by the channeled particle , we get sufficient amplification of the intensity of radiation .",
    "the expressions for the spectral and angular distribution ( [ sp - ug ] ) which is obtained in this work shows the specific properties of considered radiation : concentration of the emitted energy within an narrow cone around the forward direction if the channeled particle is relativistic ; there is a resonance peaking angular distribution at frequency @xmath92  the frequency of the radiation of channeled particle ; there is also a resonance peak on frequency @xmath93  the frequency of vibrations of atoms of the crystal lattice .",
    "emission spectrum which is integrated over the angles has the following features : the boundaries of the spectrum are determined by the frequency of the channeled particles oscillation @xmath16  spectrum lies in the interval @xmath94 ; spectrum has the form of a sharp peak at a frequency @xmath93 for small enough values of the attenuation factor @xmath24 .",
    "the occurrence of such resonance is possible if @xmath95 . or in case of an ultrarelativistic particle @xmath96 .",
    "the lower boundary of the spectrum is much smaller in this case and can be neglected .",
    "a rather simple model of the crystal lattice has been used just to demonstrate the essence of this phenomenon .",
    "many details have not yet been taken into account .",
    "for example , this paper does not consider the thermal vibrations of the atoms .",
    "thermal vibrations can substantially influence the dynamics of the channeled particle , especially at axial channeling when the negatively charged particle moves close to the atomic chain .",
    "radiation caused by the thermal vibrations is incoherent and has isotropic angular distribution while the considered radiation of vibrating atoms is coherent and strongly collimated around the radiation cone of the channeled particle .",
    "hence , it can be resolved from the thermal radiation .",
    "another factor that has an impact on the coherence of radiation is the number @xmath38 of oscillations of the channeled particle . in case of thin crystal",
    "it depends on the crystal thickness .",
    "otherwise it depends on the length of the particle channelling and is restricted by de - channelling process owing to multiple scattering by electrons and thermal vibrations of crystalline lattice atoms . anyway , if we are speaking about the channelling of a particle , we mean that @xmath97 .",
