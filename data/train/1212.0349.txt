    "at present , the activity of sgr a * seems to be in the low - state , with the x - ray luminosity of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "there are evidences of past activities @xcite , where the luminosity had reached as high as @xmath2 .",
    "recently , rapid flaring from sgr a * was observed in various wave lengths @xcite .",
    "thus , it is quite important to understand how these large variations in the luminosity took place .",
    "one possibility is the intermittent supply of gas in the form of high - density clouds .",
    "the compact cloud g2 @xcite might be offering us the first opportunity to study such an interaction of a gas cloud and smbh .",
    "while the formation mechanism of the cloud is under debate @xcite , we know that the orbit of g2 , determined from observations since 2004 , is highly eccentric , and g2 will reach the pericenter of its orbit in the mid 2013 ( @xmath3 ) , with the pericenter distance of only @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported the updates of pericentric distance and pericenter passage epoch as @xmath5 and sep 2013 ( @xmath6 ) , respectively .",
    "@xcite reported different values of @xmath7 and mar 2014 ( @xmath8 ) . in @xcite , these are now @xmath9 and mar 2014 ( @xmath10 ) .    @xcite studied the evolution of g2 using high - resolution adoptive mesh refinement calculation in two dimensions . in their calculation",
    ", the cloud loses the kinetic energy during the pericenter passage due to the ram pressure from the hot atmosphere around the smbh , and gas accretion to smbh starts in early 2013 , and continues for several decades with a nearly constant accretion rate .    however , it is not clear if the two - dimensional calculation is appropriate or not .",
    "the cloud should experience strong compression in the direction perpendicular to the orbital plane , due to the tidal force from the smbh , resulting in a very thin structure .",
    "because of this structure change , the ram pressure might become ineffective unlike two - dimensional simulations .",
    "in addition , this compression energy is emitted via radiation immediately .",
    "it is therefore expected that the luminosity of the cloud will increase during the pericenter passage .",
    "since the tidal force in the vertical direction is proportional to the distance from the orbital plane , the cloud will contract uniformly .",
    "there is no shock during this contraction , as long as the cloud maintains a finite thickness .",
    "@xcite carried out the three - dimensional mesh simulations , but they neglected the effects of the radiative cooling and therefore did not notice this brightening .    in order to study these effects",
    ", we performed fully three - dimensional simulations , in which the compressional heating and radiative cooling of the cloud are consistently taken into account .",
    "we solved the evolution of a system consisting of sgr a * , hot - ambient gas , and the cloud by @xmath11-body / smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations . here",
    ", we adopted the compact cloud scenario @xcite .",
    "we modelled sgr a * as a sink particle @xcite with the mass of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this sink particle can absorb nearby gas particles .",
    "the sink radius is @xmath13 , which is 350 times larger than the real horizon scale of smbh , @xmath14 , and is 10 times smaller than the pericenter distance .",
    "when a gas particle is absorbed by the sink particle , the gas particle is removed and its mass is added to that of the sink particle .",
    "we did not consider the emission from the absorbed gas since observations suggest that accretion flow around sgr a * is expressed by radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) @xcite .",
    "a diffuse and hot x - ray emitting gas around sgr a * @xcite was modelled by yuan s riaf model @xcite , following previous studies of g2 @xcite .",
    "the density and temperature profiles are given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the distance from sgr a * and @xmath17 is the scaling parameter of gas density .",
    "we changed @xmath17 from @xmath18 ( run 1 ) through @xmath19 ( run 2 ) to @xmath20 ( run 3 ) in order to investigate the effect of the hot gas to the evolution of g2 .",
    "the rotation and inhomogeneity of the hot gas at the initial state were neglected , whereas the dynamical evolution was allowed .",
    "although this profile is convectively unstable @xcite , we did not try to prevent the growth of convection . in our model , we allowed the radiative cooling of the hot gas , resulting in the accretion rate consistent to the value suggested by the observation .",
    "because of this accretion flow , the growth of the convection was effectively suppressed .",
    "the cloud , g2 , was modelled as a spherical gas cloud of three earth mass and a uniform density distribution .",
    "the initial radius of the cloud is @xmath21 and the initial temperature of the gas is @xmath22 .",
    "the orbit of the cloud is that of @xcite where the pericenter distance is @xmath4 and the pericenter passage epoch is @xmath23 .",
    "we adopted a.d .",
    "1995 as the starting epoch of the simulations and solved the evolution of the cloud for @xmath24 years .",
    "this cloud was in the hydrostatic equilibrium with the ambient gas in a.d .",
    "1995 , @xmath25 : the pressure ratio of the cloud to the hot ambient gas was @xmath26 . if the cloud is formed at the apocenter , it should has too elongated structure which is inconsistent to the observation @xcite .          @xmath27 pericentric distance .",

    "the duration time is fixed as one year .",
    "+      we have performed fully three - dimensional simulations of the evolution of the g2 cloud .",
    "our result differs from the result of previous two - dimensional simulations in ( i ) strong vertical compression leads to the heating up and flaring up of the cloud at the first pericenter passage , and ( ii ) because of this compression , ram - pressure drag from the hot atmosphere is ineffective in removing the energy and angular momentum of the cloud .    in our standard model , the peak luminosity would reach @xmath35 times the solar luminosity .",
    "the luminosity depends on the assumed internal velocity structure of the cloud , and thus might be fainter by one order of magnitude .",
    "since the peak luminosity is from the tidal compressional heating , it does not depend on the assumption on the structure of the hot atmosphere around the smbh .",
    "we therefore believe that our prediction is pretty robust .",
    "the increase of the luminosity of the cloud would be detectable in near infrared bands about six months before the pericenter passage epoch . in parallel ,",
    "the increase of the vertical velocity is probably observable as the line broadening .",
    "since the vertical velocity should strongly depend on the position of the gas on the orbit , it is very important to measure the variation of the velocity profile both in space and time .",
