    "<S> we demonstrate a method of creating photonic two - dimensional cluster states that is considerably more efficient than previously proposed approaches . </S>",
    "<S> our method uses only local unitaries and type - i fusion operations . </S>",
    "<S> the increased efficiency of our method compared to previously proposed constructions is obtained by identifying and exploiting local equivalence properties inherent in cluster states .    </S>",
    "<S> cluster states are entangled states constructed in such a way as to enable universal quantum computation ( qc ) , effected solely by suitable measurements performed on the constituents of the cluster  @xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present a new method for constructing _ photonic _ </S>",
    "<S> clusters that is more efficient than previously presented methods .    </S>",
    "<S> photonic quantum computation has received significant attention in recent years . the initial work on photonic qc considered different _ circuit - based _ approaches  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since quantum computational logic transformations , such as the cnot gate , require a mechanism by which qubits directly interact , the choice of photons as qubits in turn motivated the choice of nonlinear kerr - type media in the first analyses of photonic qc  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although this approach in principle enables photonic entangling gates , the practical difficulties associated with the use of kerr - type media made this method appear problematic .    </S>",
    "<S> interest in photonic qc was renewed with the appearance of the work of knill , laflamme and milburn ( klm ) in 2001  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach makes use of linear optics , combined with measurements carried out on ancillary photons , in order to circumvent the difficulties associated with the use of nonlinear media . </S>",
    "<S> although it avoids the use of nonlinear media , the klm approach to linear optics quantum computation ( loqc ) is nevertheless problematic due to the inefficiency associated with the necessity of dealing with extremely large numbers of ancillary photons  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> both of these approaches to photonic qc , the nonlinear approach and the linear approach , are formulated within the circuit - based paradigm . with the discovery of the cluster - based paradigm </S>",
    "<S> , it became natural to explore the possibility of using photons as the nodes in a cluster .    </S>",
    "<S> nielsen noted @xcite that a photonic cluster could furnish a more efficient realization of a quantum computation than a photonic circuit if certain techniques from loqc were used to _ build _ the photonic cluster ( as opposed to directly _ executing _ the computation itself ) . </S>",
    "<S> browne and rudolph @xcite refined this idea , and presented a more efficient scheme for the construction of photonic clusters . in this scheme , the suggestion of nielsen to use loqc - derived operations to construct the cluster , is replaced by a proposal to use simpler  fusion \" operations to construct the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> a number of additional methods for constructing clusters have been suggested @xcite and small photonic cluster states have been experimentally implemented @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present a method for constructing generic clusters that , in the case of photonic clusters in particular , is considerably more efficient than previously proposed methods . </S>",
    "<S> the increased efficiency is achieved by identifying certain equivalence classes of cluster configurations , which are exploited to reduce the number of distinct transformations that are needed to generate clusters suitable for carrying out universal qc . </S>",
    "<S> our technique makes use of the properties of equivalent graph states under local unitaries and graph isomorphisms , and combines this with the use of type - i fusion operations . </S>",
    "<S> we thus entirely avoid the use of resource - costly type - ii fusion operations . </S>",
    "<S> our approach results in a significant increase in cluster construction efficiency . in particular , we show that our method is more efficient , in terms of resources used , than that of @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the following equivalence , described in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a 4-qubit linear cluster , or chain , is equivalent to a @xmath0 box cluster up to hadamard rotations and a swap operation . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the action of a hadamard rotation on the @xmath1th qubit by the symbol @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the symbol @xmath3 denotes the swap operation acting on qubits @xmath1 and @xmath4 , which can be realized by simply relabeling the qubits . applying @xmath5 to a 4-qubit cluster chain and exchanging the labels of qubits 2 and 3 </S>",
    "<S> effectively adds a bond between qubits 1 and 4 . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in figure 1a .    </S>",
    "<S> note that figure 1a depicts a transformation that involves _ only the four qubits shown _ in the diagram . </S>",
    "<S> we extend this transformation by embedding the 4-qubit chain in a larger linear structure of arbitrary size , as depicted in figure 1b . here </S>",
    "<S> the chain extends arbitrarily far in both directions . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the extensions in both directions of the initial chain in figure 1b reflects the existence of additional entanglement correlations between qubits 1 and 4 and the qubits along the chain extensions . </S>",
    "<S> one can show that these additional entanglement correlations are in fact preserved by the same transformation utilized in figure 1a  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have thus extended the  box construction \" method given in @xcite to obtain a  box - on - a - chain construction \" method . </S>",
    "<S> we now apply our  box - on - a - chain construction \" method to the problem of generating generic clusters suitable for carrying out universal qc . </S>",
    "<S> following the suggestion in references  @xcite and @xcite , we adopt the use of an @xmath6-shaped lattice , constructed from arbitrary length chains , as a basic  building block \" with which to construct clusters capable of carrying out universal qc . in this way the @xmath6-shaped lattice serves as a standard figure - of - merit with which to measure the efficiency of the construction of general quantum computational clusters .    </S>",
    "<S> our efficient method of constructing the @xmath6-shape is illustrated in figure 1c . </S>",
    "<S> we start with a cluster chain , drawn suggestively as the left - most element in figure 1c . after carrying out </S>",
    "<S> the transformation already described to obtain the middle element in figure 1c , one then applies a @xmath7 measurement on qubit 2 to produce the @xmath6-shape in the right - most element in figure 1c . </S>",
    "<S> this operation deletes 2 bonds from the cluster chain due to the measurement of qubit 2 . </S>",
    "<S> note that this technique requires no probabilistic operations , _ and carries a net cost of only 2 cluster chain bonds_. in contrast , browne and rudolph use the probabilistic type - ii fusion operation to build the @xmath6-shape requiring , on average , 8 bonds from previously constructed cluster chains  @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) figure 1a shows how hadamard and swap operations are used to transform a chain into a box shape . in figure </S>",
    "<S> 1b the above operations are used to prepare the  box - on - a - chain \" cluster state . in figure 1c , the  box - on - a - chain </S>",
    "<S> \" form is used to create the basic @xmath6-shape used as a building block for cluster states capable of universal quantum computation . to achieve this , a @xmath7 measurement on qubit 2 deletes all bonds involving the measured qubit , deterministically giving the desired @xmath6-shape cluster at a cost of only two bonds.,height=219 ]    our technique for constructing the basic @xmath6-shape cluster  building blocks \" is generic , and not specific to photonic quantum bits . in order to yield a complete , integrated method of efficiently constructing general _ photonic _ clusters capable of universal qc </S>",
    "<S> , we can combine our method of constructing @xmath6-shapes with the already - known type - i fusion operation of browne and rudolph . </S>",
    "<S> this integrated cluster generation method is significantly more efficient than previously proposed approaches : the increased efficiency derives from the improved efficiency of our @xmath6-shape generation technique as compared to the costly technique based on the use of type - ii fusion operations . </S>",
    "<S> type - ii fusion operations are not needed in our approach .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) two @xmath6-shape clusters , of the type constructed in figure [ f1]c , are linked _ via _ a type - i fusion operation . </S>",
    "<S> begin with separate chains as in figure 2a . </S>",
    "<S> figures 2b and 2c illustrate the deterministic transformation of the chains into 2 @xmath6-shapes . </S>",
    "<S> a type - i fusion operation is applied : if successful , the sideways @xmath8-shape shown in figure 2d is created ; if unsuccessful , recover two separate chains , return to figure 2a and repeat.,height=219 ]    the general method for constructing a 2-dimensional cluster , such as the  sideways @xmath8-shape \" illustrated in figure 2d , proceeds as follows . </S>",
    "<S> we start with the assumption that we have two chains of arbitrary length , as illustrated in figure 2a . </S>",
    "<S> given two initial chains , we _ deterministically _ transform each of them into an @xmath6-shape using our method described above , shown in figure 2b , at a cost of 2 bonds for each @xmath6-shape , or a net cost of 4 bonds . </S>",
    "<S> ( in constrast , transforming two chains into 2 @xmath6-shapes , using the _ non - deterministic _ type - ii fusion operations of browne and rudolph , would cost 8 bonds on average for each @xmath6-shape , and would thus result in an average net cost of 16 bonds . ) then , making use of the type - i fusion operation of browne and rudolph , we attempt to adjoin the 2 completed @xmath6-shapes illustrated in figure 2c to form the desired 2-dimensional @xmath8-shape cluster . since the type - i fusion operation succeeds with probability @xmath9 , </S>",
    "<S> there are two possible outcomes : ( 1 ) if the joining operation _ succeeds _ as shown in figure 2d we are done , and the desired 2-dimensional cluster has been built at a net cost of 4 bonds . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , had the initial @xmath6-shapes been formed using type - ii fusion operations , the average net cost of the 2-dimensional cluster would have been 16 bonds . ( 2 ) if the joining operation _ fails _ , each @xmath6-shape reverts to a chain , returning us to the state illustrated in figure 2a , incurring a net additional cost of 2 bonds . </S>",
    "<S> then , the process described above is iterated , beginning with the new chains that resulted from the failure of the attempted joining operation , until success is achieved . upon such iteration , </S>",
    "<S> the average net cost for a successful outcome is 10 bonds if the initial ( and subsequent ) chains are transformed into @xmath6-shapes using our technique , but the average net cost would have been 34 bonds had the various chains been transformed into @xmath6-shapes using the type - ii fusion operation of browne and rudolph .    </S>",
    "<S> we have presented a method for constructing 2-dimensional photonic clusters by making use of the type - i fusion operation of browne and rudolph combined with our technique for transforming a given cluster chain into the basic @xmath6-shape . as demonstrated above , this method of generating a 2-dimensional @xmath8-shape cluster </S>",
    "<S> is significantly more efficient than the original proposal of @xcite that makes use of type - i _ and _ type - ii fusion operations . </S>",
    "<S> we note that @xmath8-shapes are comprised of a single  rung \" connecting two chains . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath8-shapes can be grown into  sideways ladder \" shapes that possess additional rungs , by repeatedly applying our method along the length of an initial @xmath8-shape . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , two - dimensional clusters with greater depth than an @xmath8-shape ( or a sideways ladder ) can be built by adjoining parallel chains to a given @xmath8-shaped cluster . </S>",
    "<S> this is done , one depth level at a time , by applying our method to a given additional chain and either of the  </S>",
    "<S> outer \" sides of the starting @xmath8-shape . in this way , making use of our technique for creating basic @xmath6-shapes out of chains , a 2-dimensional cluster of any complexity can be formed , with a significant increase in efficiency compared to previous approaches  -shapes ( and more general  sideways ladder \" shapes ) , in which the rungs connecting adjacent chains include more than one qubit node , are constructed by adjoining modified @xmath6-shapes that have been augmented using type - i fusion operations to incorporate additional qubit nodes . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , one constructs simple bonds connecting adjacent chains ( _ i.e. _ ,  nodeless rungs \" ) , by removing nodes as required using @xmath10 measurements . ] .    </S>",
    "<S> our cluster construction method employs only local unitary rotations and type - i fusion operations : type - ii fusion operations are neither needed nor used , which results in a significant increase in the efficiency of photonic cluster construction as discussed above . although our method makes no use of type - ii fusion operations , this does not compromise the generality or diminish the flexibility of the method . as an illustration of this flexibility , </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss a sample of typical cluster shapes that can be constructed making use only of local unitaries and type - i fusion operations .    as a first example </S>",
    "<S> , we note that a cluster chain can be deterministically transformed into a cross shape . following the progression illustrated in figure [ f2 ] , apply @xmath11 followed by @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this forms bonds between qubits 1 and 4 , and between qubits 4 and 7 . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent execution of @xmath7 measurements on qubits 3 and 5 creates the desired cross shape at a cost of only 4 bonds and involves no probabilistic operations .     </S>",

    "<S> this may then be used as a resource to continue building the overall desired cluster structure . ] . </S>",
    "<S> this shape in turn may be used to attempt to build the cluster illustrated in figure 4e . </S>",
    "<S> one proceeds by using type - i fusion operations to fuse qubits 10 and 12 , followed by a @xmath10 measurement applied to qubits 6 and 11 . </S>",
    "<S> if the fusion fails , rather than performing the @xmath10 measurement , we attempt to fuse qubits 6 and 11 _ via _ type - i fusion . </S>",
    "<S> if that also fails one recovers the basic structure of figure [ f3]b . </S>",
    "<S> if either fusion operation succeeds ( _ i.e. _ , applied to the pair \\{10,12 } or \\{6,11 } ) , we continue building a more general structure making use of the cluster of figure [ f3]e . further exploring our approach to generating basic structures , we note that the cluster shapes in figures 4f and 4 g are generically useful . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster shape illustrated in figure 4f may be deterministically constructed by starting with a 10-qubit chain and applying suitable hadamard and swap operations by analogy with the transformation of a 7-qubit chain into the shape given in figure 4b . </S>",
