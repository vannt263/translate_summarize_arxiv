    "phase estimation is an important task in quantum metrology .",
    "classically the measurement precision in optical phase estimation is bounded by the standard quantum limit ( sql ) , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the total number of photons .",
    "such sensitivity , however , can be further enhanced by exploiting spin - squeezing techniques  @xcite . in 1981 , caves  @xcite pointed out that , by feeding a high intensity coherent state in one input port of a interferometer and a low intensity squeezed vacuum state in the other , the phase sensitivity can approach the heisenberg scaling , @xmath2 .",
    "the sql can also be beat by employing non - classical entangled states  .",
    "the realization of surpassing the sql as well as approaching the heisenberg limit have brought about significant progress in recent years  .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , caves also pointed out that , in order to enhance precision of measurement , the phase difference of the input states should satisfy a certain relation . such relation is called the phase - matching condition ( pmc ) . recently a more general pmc for even ( odd ) states has been investigated  @xcite .",
    "however , it remains unknown whether non - even ( odd ) states also have a general pmc invariance .",
    "therefore , the major purpose of this paper is to study the pmc of non - even ( odd ) states , especially under particle losses .    in this paper , we discuss a specific mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "one of the input port is injected by a coherent state and the other is injected by a coherent superposition state whose parity depends on an adjustable parameter .",
    "we first give an analytic expression of the qfi without particle losses and determine a pmc to optimize the parameter precision .",
    "then we consider a setting where particle losses occur in both arms with the same transmission coefficient and give the expression of the qfi as well as the pmc . based on the expressions of the qfis",
    ", we prove that the pmc keeps unchanged for any transmission coefficients , whether input state is with parity or not .",
    "mach - zehnder ( mz ) interferometer is a well - known optical apparatus in quantum metrology .",
    "it can be used to study many counterintuitive phenomena in quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "a general mz interferometer mainly consists of beam splitters and phase shifts .",
    "a su(2 ) mz interferometer can be described by schwinger operators , which are  @xcite @xmath3 were @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 are annihilation and creation operators for ports a and b. above schwinger operators satisfy the commutation relations @xmath8=i\\epsilon_{ijk}j_{k } , \\label{eq : commutation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the levi - civita symbol .",
    "a 50:50 beam splitter can be described by a unitary transformation  @xcite @xmath10 and the phase shift is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the phase difference between two arms after phase shift . with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bx ] ) and ( [ eq : pz ] ) , the total transformation performed by the mz interferometer can be expressed by @xmath13    a vivid picture for the performance of the su(2 ) mz interferometer can be given  @xcite from the angular momentum description of the schwinger operators .",
    "the operators @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 can also be treated as the rotation operation to the input states about the @xmath17 axis and the @xmath18 axis , respectively . combining the three operations in sequence ,",
    "the transformation of total setup is equivalent to a rotation about the @xmath19 axis .",
    "fisher information , initially introduced by fisher  @xcite in 1925 , is a very important quantity in statistics .",
    "quantum fisher information ( qfi ) is the quantum extension of fisher information and of great significance in quantum technology and quantum metrology  @xcite . in quantum metrology",
    ", it is a central concept to describe the lowest bound for the precision of a parameter under estimation .",
    "the variance of an unbiased estimator @xmath20 ( i.e. , @xmath21 ) for the parameter @xmath12 is theoretically bounded by the quantum cramr - rao inequality : @xmath22  @xcite , where @xmath23 is the variance , @xmath24 is the repeated times of experiments and @xmath25 refers to quantum fisher information .",
    "the quantum fisher information is defined by @xmath26  @xcite , where @xmath27 is so - called symmetric logarithmic derivative ( sld ) and is determined by the equation @xmath28    recently , it has been found that the quantum fisher information for a non - full rank density matrix is determined by its support  @xcite . denote the spectral decomposition @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the dimension of the support , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 are the @xmath33th eigenvalue and eigenstate for @xmath34 , respectively . in this representation",
    ", the quantum fisher information can be expressed by  @xcite @xmath35",
    "first we consider an ideal mach - zehnder interferometer without particle losses . for a pure input state @xmath36 ,",
    "the output state is @xmath37 .",
    "based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : umz ] ) , one can easily find that the qfi is @xmath38 utilizing the expression of @xmath39 , the qfi can be expressed by @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are average photon numbers for arm a and b , respectively .",
    "the expected value @xmath43 .    in this paper , we choose the input state in port a to be a coherent state @xmath44 and that in port b to be a coherent superposition state @xmath45 , where @xmath46 with @xmath47 also a coherent state and @xmath48 the normalized number , @xmath49 . here the relative phase between two input ports is @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , so @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "notice that when @xmath53 , @xmath54 owns parity , i.e. , it is a even state satisfying @xmath55 .",
    "after obtaining the terms , @xmath56 the qfi becomes @xmath57 from this equation , it is easy to see that with fixed @xmath58 , the pmc to maximum the qfi will always be satisfied as @xmath59 , regardless of the valus of @xmath60 , that is , no matter input state has parity or not , the pmc does not change .    when @xmath59 , the maximal qfi @xmath61 becomes @xmath62 note that under the pmc , @xmath61 only depends on the average photon numbers of both ports : @xmath63 and @xmath64 . and to investigate the relationship between the qfi and the phase sensitivity limit , we can also express @xmath61 in terms of total photon number @xmath1 by denoting @xmath65 . with eq .",
    "( [ eq : n ] ) , @xmath1 can be expressed as @xmath66 then @xmath61 becomes @xmath67 large @xmath25 is required for the enhancement of phase sensitivity , and this needs high intensity of input states , which means @xmath68 .",
    "then with high intensity and suppose the total photon number is fixed , it is not difficult to find that @xmath69 . under this condition , @xmath61 can lead to approach the heisenberg scaling  @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , when @xmath70 is large enough , the term which contains @xmath71 will become neglectable , indicating that the parity of input states not only does not affect the pmc , but also makes no difference to the value of @xmath61 under high intensity .",
    "in section iv we have discussed the pmc without particle losses , which is an ideal scenario .",
    "now we will take into account the effects of photon losses on pmc .",
    "essentially , one can use a fictitious beam splitter to describe the photon losses process . in this paper",
    "we will use @xmath72 $ ] to describe both real and fictitious beam splitters , where @xmath73 is the so - called transmission coefficient . as for fictitious beam splitters , when @xmath74 , there are no particle losses , which goes back to our previous discussion ; when @xmath75 , all the photons leak out of the interferometer . for convenience",
    "we also define the reflection coefficient r , which satisfies @xmath76 .",
    "note that the operator @xmath77 actually has no difference from the general form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bx ] ) , that is @xmath78 we just substitute @xmath79 with @xmath80 , i.e. , @xmath81 .",
    "essentially , the whole photon loss setting can be converted into a neat scenario , which includes three steps : ( 1 ) the input state imports into a mz interferometer without any loss on photons and passes the first beam splitter ; ( 2 ) the output state goes through a particle loss channel ; ( 3 ) the final state after particle loss undergoes a phase shift and passes the second beam splitter .    for simplicity , we assume that the transmission coefficient @xmath73 are the same on both arms and the input state is separable : @xmath82 . then after the first 50:50 beam splitter @xmath83 we have @xmath84 where @xmath85 $ ] .",
    "then the state goes through a particle loss process , after which we have @xmath86 where @xmath87 $ ] and @xmath88 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath89 and @xmath90 with @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 the annihilation and creation operators of mode c and d. trace operation is conducted here to eliminate the information on mode c and mode d. and consequently we need to cope with mixed states afterwards . since the second beam splitter merely causes a rotation of @xmath34 in the hilbert space , it does not affect the qfi , and we shall omit it in the following discussion .",
    "now we continue to use the previous states as input states , that is , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , where @xmath46 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 . after some algebra , we can express @xmath34 in the following form ( see appendix a ) @xmath97 where @xmath98 , @xmath99 . here",
    "@xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "in addition , notice that since the second beam splitter is omitted from the calculation , now we should use the operator @xmath102 instead of @xmath39 , and the expression of the qfi becomes @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are eigenvalues and eigenstates of @xmath34 .",
    "it is easy to find that  @xcite @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the determinant of @xmath34 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 are orthogonal basis vectors for the matrix of @xmath34 , and @xmath110 with @xmath111 . then through some calculation",
    "( see appendix b ) we have the analytic expression of the qfi as @xmath112 where @xmath113}\\right)$ ] , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 .    to have a more intuitional vision of the result ,",
    "we have plotted it as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch_2 ] . from this figure",
    "we can see that the analytic results coincide well with the numerical ones as the transmission coefficient @xmath73 changes , the pmc does remain the same where @xmath59 . more importantly , such pmc invariance will be achieved both for input states with and without parity , that is , regardless of the value of @xmath60 . when @xmath59 , the maximal qfi @xmath61 becomes @xmath118    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch_3 ] we have plotted @xmath61 under different particle loss situation against @xmath60 as well as the corresponding @xmath1 and @xmath119 . from the figure ( a ) we can see that with low intensity of input states , the qfi can lead to the surpass of the heisenberg limit even photon losses are involved . as the total photon number @xmath1 increases , in figure ( b ) the heisenberg limit almost can only be beated by the qfi without any photon losses .",
    "however , it is still possible to surpass the sql when @xmath73 is smaller than 1 . from figure ( a ) to figure ( b )",
    "we can see that as @xmath70(or n ) increases , @xmath61 gradually becomes independent on @xmath60 , that is , when @xmath58 is large enough , the parity of input states almost does not affect the value of the qfi . as @xmath1 continue increasing(see figure ( c ) ) , the difference between with and without particle losses becomes more and more significant , even a small portion ( 10% ) of photon leak will cause the qfi to decrease dramatically .",
    "the difference between figure ( b ) and ( c ) also indicates that the higher @xmath70(or n ) is , the more difficult it is to surpass the standard quantum limit ( sql ) .",
    "now we consider what will happen to each term of @xmath61 as @xmath70 becomes larger and larger .",
    "this will give us explanations for the phenomena mentioned above .",
    "when t@xmath1201 , both @xmath121 and @xmath122 go to 0 , and @xmath123 goes to 1/2 .",
    "consequently , all terms of @xmath61 that have the factor @xmath124 go to 0 , so @xmath125 , which is independent of @xmath60 , as we have concluded from fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch_3 ] .",
    "when t=1 , however , r=0 and @xmath121=1 , and the value of @xmath126 changes significantly .",
    "recall that @xmath107 , so as t changes from a number that is slightly smaller than 1 to exact `` 1 '' , @xmath126 instantly changes from 1/4 to 0 .",
    "this leads to a nonzero term with the factor @xmath124 , that is @xmath127(=1 ) .",
    "therefore , when t=1 , @xmath128 , which is also independent of @xmath60 , as expected .",
    "it is also not difficult to see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : n ] ) that with large @xmath70 , @xmath129 .",
    "this means @xmath61 and @xmath119 are almost the same with high intensity of input state , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch_3 ] .",
    "moreover , the abrupt change of the @xmath61 caused by t also explains why that even a small portion of photon losses can lead to a significant decrease of the qfi .",
    "specifically , when @xmath53 , @xmath79 becomes zero , and qfi becomes @xmath130\\nonumber\\\\ & + 4t^{2}|\\alpha|^{4}\\cos^{2}\\phi[1 - 4n_{\\alpha}^{\\prime4}\\left(1-p_{r}^{2}\\right)]\\nonumber \\\\   & -16t^{2}|\\alpha|^{4}\\sin^{2}{\\phi}n_{\\alpha}^{\\prime4}(1-p_{r}^{2})p_{t}^{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath131 .",
    "this is the same as the result in ref .",
    "in summary , we have considered a general scenario of a mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "the input state in one mode is a coherent state and the other is a coherent superposition state whose parity can be controlled by an adjustable parameter .",
    "we have discussed both scenarios with and without particle losses and provided analytic expressions of the qfi under both circumstances .",
    "we have also shown the numeric results of the qfi with particle losses .",
    "the results indicate that the pmc is independent of phase difference between input states of the two modes and the parity of input states will not affect the qfi provided high intensity of input states is guaranteed .",
