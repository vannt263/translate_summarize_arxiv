    "the values of @xmath160 obtained are listed in table  [ tab30 ] .",
    "the no - tag event sample is used to obtain the total cross section for the reaction @xmath161 : @xmath162 in the no - tag mode the radiative correction is expected to be less than 1%  @xcite , and so the associated systematic uncertainty is assigned conservatively as 1% . taking @xmath163 and @xmath164 from table  [ tab10 ] , the value obtained from eq.([xstot ] ) is @xmath165 the quoted errors are statistical and systematic , respectively .",
    "the latter is 8.1% and includes the systematic uncertainty in the number of signal events ( 3.3% ) , the statistical and systematic errors on the detection efficiency ( 1.6% and 6.2% , respectively ) , on the background subtraction ( 3.5% ) , on the radiative correction ( 1% ) , and the error on the integrated luminosity ( 1% ) . using mc simulation ,",
    "the calculated total cross section corresponding to @xmath166 kev is found to be 2.402 pb , and hence from eq.([sigt ] ) the value @xmath167 is obtained .",
    "this result agrees with the particle data group value @xmath168 kev  @xcite , and also with the recent cleo measurement @xmath169 kev  @xcite .    to extract the transition form factor ,",
    "the measured and calculated @xmath23 spectra are compared .",
    "the simulation for single - tag events uses a constant form factor value , so that the measured normalized form factor is determined from @xmath170     differential cross section multiplied by the @xmath171 branching fraction ; the statistical and @xmath23-dependent systematic errors of table  [ tab30 ] have been combined in quadrature .",
    "[ fig25 ] ]     transition form factor normalized to @xmath28 ( points with error bars ) .",
    "the solid curve shows the fit to eq.([mono ] ) . the dotted curve shows the leading order pqcd prediction from ref .",
    "[ fig26 ] ]    the normalized form factor is proportional to the ratio of the number of single - tag events to the number of no - tag events .",
    "it is expected that part of the systematic uncertainty , in particular that associated with the detection efficiency , cancels in this ratio .",
    "however , the single - tag data sample is not large enough for a detailed study of the @xmath23-dependence of the observed data - mc simulation difference in detector response . therefore , this uncertainty is estimated conservatively to be equal to the corresponding systematic uncertainty for the single - tag events ( 6% ) .",
    "the values of the form factor obtained are listed in table  [ tab30 ] , and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig26 ] , with the statistical and @xmath23-dependent systematic errors combined .",
    "the @xmath23-independent systematic error on the form factor is 4.3% ; this value combines in quadrature the systematic uncertainty on detection efficiency , the uncertainty on the number of no - tag events , the statistical error on the detection efficiency for no - tag events , the uncertainties associated with the background subtraction , and the uncertainty on the radiative correction .",
    "the form factor data of fig .",
    "[ fig26 ] are well described by the monopole form @xmath172 as shown by the solid curve .",
    "the corresponding fitted value of the pole parameter @xmath173 is @xmath174 where the second quoted error is due to the 4.3% @xmath23-independent systematic error on the measurements .",
    "this value of the pole parameter is in reasonable agreement with that expected from vector dominance , namely @xmath175 gev@xmath7 , and in good agreement with the lattice qcd calculation , @xmath176 gev@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the dotted curve in fig .  [ fig26 ] shows the result of the leading - order pqcd calculation of ref .",
    "the data lie systematically below this prediction , but within the theoretical uncertainty quoted in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the reaction @xmath177 , with @xmath124 , has been studied in the no - tag and single - tag modes .",
    "we measure the following values for the @xmath1 mass and width : @xmath178 these results agree with earlier  measurements  @xcite and supersede them .",
    "we have also measured the total cross section @xmath179 and differential cross section @xmath180 . from these data",
    "we determine the value @xmath167 and measure the normalized @xmath181 transition form factor @xmath182 for the momentum transfer range from 2 to 50 gev@xmath7 .",
    "the latter is well described by the simple monopole form of eq.([mono ] ) with @xmath183 in agreement with both the vector dominance expectation and the qcd prediction .",
