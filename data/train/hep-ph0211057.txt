    "the hera small-@xmath2 data @xcite have introduced a challenge to the phenomenologists in order to describe the strong growth of the inclusive structure function @xmath1 as the bjorken scale @xmath2 decreases , supplemented by the scaling violations on the hard scale given by the photon virtuality @xmath3 . concerning the regge approach , at high energy the @xmath0 scattering process is dominated by the exchange of the pomeron trajectory in the @xmath4-channel .",
    "from the hadronic phenomenology , this implies that the structure function would present a mild increasing on energy ( @xmath5 ) since the soft pomeron intercept ranges around @xmath6 .",
    "such behavior is in contrast with high energy @xmath0 data , where the effective intercept takes values @xmath7 . in the regge language",
    "this situation can be solved by introducing the idea of new poles in the complex angular momentum plane , for instance rendered in the multipoles models @xcite , producing quite successful data description .",
    "other proposition is the two pomeron model @xcite , introducing an additional hard intercept and corresponding residue .",
    "however , a shortcoming from these approaches is the poor knowledge about the behavior on virtuality , in general modeled in an empirical way through the vertex functions .",
    "on the other hand , the high photon virtuality allows applicability of the qcd perturbative methods .",
    "the dglap formalism @xcite is quite successful in describing most of the measurements on structure functions at hera and hard processes in the hadronic colliders .",
    "this feature is even intriguing , since its theoretical limitations at high energy are well known @xcite .",
    "other perturbative approach is the bfkl formalism @xcite , well established at lo level but not yet completely understood at nlo accuracy .",
    "the main issue in the nlo bfkl effects is the correct account of the sub - leading corrections in the all orders resummation @xcite .",
    "the lo bfkl approach can describe hera structure function in a limited kinematical range , i.e. at not so large @xmath3 and small-@xmath2 .",
    "a consistent treatment considering higher order resummations is currently being available and applications should be allowed in a near future .",
    "in this contribution we report on the extension of the data fitting to the hera structure function @xmath1 using as a model for the hard pomeron the finite sum of gluon ladders @xcite .",
    "the model is based on the truncation of the bfkl series considering only the first few orders in the strong coupling perturbative expansion , where subleading contributions can be absorbed in the adjustable parameters . from the phenomenology on hadronic collisions @xcite , just three orders",
    ", @xmath8 ^ 2 $ ] , are enough to describe current accelerator data .",
    "the hard pomeron model should be supplemented by a soft piece accounting for the non - perturbative contributions to the process .",
    "the description therefore turns out similar to the two pomeron model @xcite , with the advantage of a complete knowledge of the behaviors on @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the original model contains a reduced number of adjustable parameters : the normalization @xmath9 and the non - perturbative scale @xmath10 from the proton impact factor and the parameter @xmath11 scaling the logarithms on energy .    in spirit of a global analysis , in the ref .",
    "@xcite two distinct choices for the soft pomeron were analised .",
    "the resulting two pomeron model was successful in describing data on structure function @xmath1 and its derivatives ( slopes on @xmath3 and @xmath2 ) for @xmath12 and @xmath13 gev@xmath14 . here ,",
    "we extend the description to the whole @xmath2 range and analise the relative role of the hard and soft pieces in the results .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in the next section we shortly review the main expressions for the hard piece given by the summation up to the two - rung ladder contribution . in sec .",
    "( 3 ) , an overall fit to the recent deep inelastic data is performed based on the hard contribution referred above supplemented by the remaining soft pomeron and non - singlet contributions . in the last section we draw up our conclusions .",
    "here we review the elements needed to calculate the structure function using the finite sum of gluon ladders in the @xmath0 collision , with center of mass energy @xmath15 .",
    "the proton inclusive structure function , written in terms of the cross sections for the scattering of transverse or longitudinal polarized photons , reads as @xcite @xmath16 \\,,\\\\",

    "the @xmath20 is the virtual photon impact factor and @xmath21 is the proton impact factor . the first one is well known in perturbation theory at leading order , while the latter is modeled since in the proton vertex there is no hard scale to allow pqcd calculations .",
    "the kernel @xmath22 contains the dynamics of the process , for instance the bfkl kernel .",
    "the amplitudes can be calculated order by order : for instance the born contribution coming from the two gluon exchange and the one - rung ladder contribution read as , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is considered fixed since we are in the framework of the lo bfkl approach .",
    "the perturbative kernel @xmath25 can be calculated order by order in the perturbative expansion @xcite .",
    "the pomeron is attached to the off - shell incoming photon through the quark loop diagrams , where the reggeized gluons are attached to the same and to different quarks in the loop .",
    "the virtual photon impact factor averaged over the transverse polarizations reads as @xcite , @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the sudakov variables associated to the momenta in the photon vertex and @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "gauge invariance requires the proton impact factor vanishing at @xmath18 going to zero and is modeled in a simple way , @xmath31 where @xmath9 is the unknown normalization of the proton impact factor and @xmath10 is a scale which is typical of the non - perturbative dynamics .",
    "these scales will be considered adjustable parameters in the analysis .",
    "considering the electroproduction process , summing the first orders in perturbation theory we can write the expression for the inclusive structure function , @xmath32 , \\label{eq7 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath33 correspond to the @xmath34-rung gluon ladder contribution .",
    "the quantity @xmath11 gives the scale normalizing the logarithms on energy for the lla bfkl approach , which is arbitrary and enters as an additional parameter .",
    "the contributions are written explicitly as , @xmath35 where @xmath36 . the main result in ref .",
    "@xcite is in a good agreement , in terms of a @xmath37 test , for the inclusive structure function in the range @xmath38 gev@xmath14 , once considering the restricted kinematical constraint @xmath39 .",
    "the non - perturbative contribution ( from the soft dynamics ) , initially considered as a background , was found to be not negligible .",
    "we have estimated that such effects introduce a correction of the same order in the overall normalization . in the next section",
    "we perform a global analysis in lines of our previous work @xcite , extending the range on @xmath2 fitted by adding the non - singlet contribution modeled through the usual regge parameterizations .",
    "in order to perform the fitting procedure , for the hard piece one uses eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) and for the soft piece we have selected a model with the most economical number of parameters . for this purpose",
    "it was selected the latest version @xcite of the ckmt model @xcite :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the pomeron intercept .",
    "the non - singlet term is taken in a form , @xmath42    concerning the hard piece , eq . ( [ eq7 ] ) , we selected the overall normalization factor as a free parameter , defined as @xmath43 , considering four active flavors .",
    "it was also supplemented by a factor @xmath44 accounting for the large @xmath2 effects . for the fitting procedure",
    "we consider the data set containing all available hera data for the proton structure function @xmath1 @xcite , @xcite - @xcite adding only several data set of fixed target experiments @xcite . for the fit we have used @xmath45 experimental points for all available @xmath2 and @xmath46 gev@xmath14 .    in the figs .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) ( [ fig2 ] ) and ( [ fig3 ] ) are shown the results considering three different fitting procedures : ( i ) overall fit using the hard piece and the soft pieces , eqs .",
    "( [ softpom ] ) and ( [ softreg ] ) ; ( ii ) overall fit restricting the soft pomeron intercept ; ( iii ) fitting only the hard piece plus non - singlet contribution . the best fit parameters for these procedures are presented in table ( 1 ) . in the following we discuss each one , pointing out the relative contribution from the hard and soft pieces . the procedure ( i )",
    "provides the same quality description @xmath47 in the whole available interval of bjorken variable and virtuality ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) as in the previous analysis @xcite .",
    "it is worthy note that the relative contribution of soft pomeron remains the same in comparison with this analysis , i.e. the hard and soft pieces are comparable in the considered experimental domain .",
    "this feature is related to the choice for a ckmt pomeron , i.e. a @xmath3 dependent intercept ranging from @xmath50 up to @xmath51 .",
    "the fit is comparable with those using a two - pomeron analysis @xcite .    in the procedure ( ii )",
    ", we have restricted the soft pomeron intercept through the following way , @xmath52 where a relatively good result was obtained in the restricted interval of vituality @xmath53 gev@xmath14 .",
    "the parameters obtained are shown in table ( 1 ) .",
    "the quality is slightly worst than the procedure ( i ) .",
    ".parameters of the fit . procedure ( i ) : hard plus soft terms ; procedure ( ii ) : similar to analysis ( i ) , but restricting soft pomeron intercept ; procedure ( iii ) : only hard term and non - singlet contribution . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , we succeeded to perform a fit not considering the soft pomeron contribution , but keeping the non - singlet term .",
    "the procedure ( iii ) gives reasonable results in the interval @xmath54 gev@xmath14 , as shown in table ( 1 ) .",
    "a shortcoming in these results is quite small value for the strong coupling constant , suggesting it being kept fixed .",
    "for instance , one can uses @xmath55 .",

    "( [ fig2 ] ) and ( [ fig3 ] ) we verify the relative role between the hard and soft pomeron .",
    "we present it explicitly for the virtualities 15 , 150 and 8000 gev@xmath14 , where the contributions from fitting ( i ) and ( ii ) are shown .",
    "the general feature found is that in the procedure ( i ) , the hard and soft pieces are almost equivalent at small @xmath2 and intermediate @xmath3 .",
    "the soft contribution strongly decreases as the virtualities are large . from the procedure ( ii )",
    ", the soft piece corresponds to a small contribution in contrast with the analysis ( i ) . in conclusion",
    ", we verify that the fitting procedure is equivalent to the model using a two - pomeron approach @xcite , with the advantage of clear understanding of the behaviors on @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the corresponding hard content and extending our previous analysis made in ref .",
