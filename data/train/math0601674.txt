    "<S> given a parametric polynomial ideal @xmath0 , the algorithm dispgb , introduced by the author in 2002 , builds up a binary tree describing a dichotomic discussion of the different reduced grbner bases depending on the values of the parameters , whose set of terminal vertices form a comprehensive grbner system ( cgs ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is relevant to obtain cgs s having further properties in order to make them more useful for the applications . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> the interest is focused on obtaining a canonical cgs . </S>",
    "<S> we define the objective , show the difficulties and formulate a natural conjecture . </S>",
    "<S> if the conjecture is true then such a canonical cgs will exist and can be computed . </S>",
    "<S> we also give an algorithm to transform our original cgs in this direction and show its utility in applications .    </S>",
    "<S> [ cols= \" < \" , ]     it can be seen that the mccgs algorithm gives a very compact solution for the problem easy to interpret . </S>",
    "<S> this is generally so for many other problems . </S>",
    "<S> it has been successfully applied to geometrical theorem discovery  @xcite obtaining very simple answers for relatively complex problems .     </S>",
    "<S> mccgs tree for exemple 1 . </S>",
    "<S> ]    there are two possible lacks coming from the conjecture and the semi - algorithm genimage as we must set artificial bounds to make it algorithmic . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the use of mccgs is at least useful to find examples where the minimal canonical cgs either does not exist or is not obtained by the actual algorithm , providing examples to test both the conjecture and the semi - algorithm .    </S>",
    "<S> finally it must be pointed out that the term order @xmath1 chosen for the computation in @xmath2 only affect the description by grbner bases of the varieties describing the segments but not to the varieties themselves . </S>"
