    "in recent years considerable effort has been focussed on understanding topological quantum field theories ( tqfts ) with defect excitations .",
    "much progress has been made in understanding topological quantum field theories and their associated defects in @xmath0 dimensions , e.g. @xcite .",
    "in particular ( levin - wen ) string nets @xcite provide a huge class of models , each of which is specified by a unitary fusion category .",
    "the structure of the excitations of these models is well understood @xcite .",
    "the models are usually given via a hilbert space description .",
    "on this hilbert space one can define ( so - called ribbon ) operators , that generate the excitations @xcite . for a particular class of fusion categories ( namely those arising from representation categories of finite groups ) the string net models are closely related to kitaev models @xcite , more precisely a fourier ( or variable ) transformation of the kitaev models leads to the so  called extended string nets @xcite .",
    "the kitaev models can be understood to describe the space of flat connections on a 2d surface @xmath2 with defect excitations , and it is in this context that ribbon operators have been constructed @xcite .",
    "this set  up is closely related @xcite to bf theory @xcite ( again with defects ) , which is a topological field theory describing locally flat connections .",
    "in contrast , tqfts in @xmath1 dimensions with defect excitations are less developed and understood , see @xcite for some recent progress . in the context of @xmath1 dimensional bf theory , with a lie group as structure group ,",
    "a ( lattice and continuum ) hilbert space description together with operators generating and measuring curvature excitations is detailed in @xcite .",
    "however one would also like to have a construction of a hilbert space and excitation generating operators for the more general case of ` q  deformed ' bf theory , which corresponds to string nets for a fusion category associated to a quantum group ( at root of unity ) .",
    "such a construction has been sketched in @xcite , but in comparison to the @xmath0d models is far less developed and understood .",
    "in particular a construction of the operator algebra that would replace the ribbon operators of @xmath0d is needed .",
    "the @xmath1 dimensional case is particularly important for quantum gravity .",
    "spin foam models @xcite are one approach to quantum gravity making heavily use of topological field theories , in particular bf theory .",
    "a main open problem for spin foam models is the exploration of the large scale limit @xcite .",
    "generically the large scale limit , constructed via coarse graining , is given by some ( possibly trivial ) topological field theory @xcite , whereas interacting theories , such as gravity , are expected to arise at phase transitions between these topological field theories @xcite .",
    "to understand the dynamics of spin foam models it is therefore important to understand better 4d topological field theories , which could arise via coarse graining from spin foam models , and their possible ( defect ) excitations .",
    "this will then help to study possible phase transitions .",
    "as proposed in @xcite 4d tqfts which arise via coarse graining from spin foams and therefore carry a geometric interpretation , can give rise to quantum geometry realizations .",
    "that is the tqft and its defect excitation would lead to a hilbert space of states , on which an operator algebra can be defined , that admits a geometric interpretation .",
    "thus states of this hilbert space describe quantum geometries .",
    "importantly this construction leads to diffeomorphism invariant continuum quantum field theories .",
    "in retrospect this has been first realized by the ashtekar  lewandowski ",
    "isham construction @xcite , which is based on a trivial topological field theory .",
    "in contrast the @xmath0d and @xmath1d quantum geometry realization constructed in @xcite is based on bf theory .",
    "recently another @xmath0d quantum geometry realization was defined @xcite based on the turaev - viro tqft @xcite , which can be interpreted as q  deformed bf theory .",
    "this realization has many advantages as compared to both the ashtekar ",
    "isham as well as the bf based construction and furthermore provides the dynamics of quantum gravity incorporating a cosmological constant .",
    "in particular the quantum field theory is based ( via an inductive limit ) on a family of finite dimensional hilbert spaces , which makes many subtle regularization procedures unnecessary .",
    "thus a @xmath1d quantum geometry realization based on q  deformed bf theory would be highly desirable .",
    "we propose in this work a strategy to make many of the techniques developed for the @xmath0 dimensional case available for the @xmath1 dimensional case .",
    "the main idea is to use a heegard splitting @xcite of the 3d manifold representing a spatial slice of the @xmath1 dimensional space ",
    "time manifold .",
    "such a heegard splitting can be obtained from a triangulation ( or lattice ) embedded into the 3d manifold .",
    "the heegard splitting leads to a so  called heegard surface .",
    "we can then define our operations on this 2d heegard surface instead of dealing with the 3d manifold itself .",
    "this allows us to use operators defined for the @xmath0 dimensional case in order to describe the @xmath1 dimensional one .",
    "heegard splittings and more generally handle decompositions @xcite have been used to construct topological field theories in 3 and 4 dimensions e.g. @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite for the use of heegard splitting and the associated reduction in dimension in quantum gravity models involving a sum over topologies . )    here , however , we deal with topological field theories with defects ( i.e. some form of extended topological field theories ) , in a ` canonical ' set  up , that is in a hilbert space description . in this set - up",
    "we are in particular looking for operators generating and measuring the defect excitations .",
    "we will describe how such operators can be induced for the @xmath1 dimensional case from the @xmath0 dimensional theory .    to make the main idea clear we will focus in this work on bf theory associated to a finite group and leave the q  deformation and more general string net models for future work . that will allow us to speak of the space of flat connections and to make intuitive use of its properties .     + the paper is structured as follows : in section [ 2dstuff ] we will review the construction of a hilbert space describing locally flat connections of a 2d surface and ( ribbon ) operators defined on such a hilbert space .",
    "the ribbon operators can generate curvature for non ",
    "contractible cycles of the 2d surface and in this sense generate excitations . in section [ 3dstuff ]",
    "we will then describe how to encode the space of flat connections on a 3d manifold with defects into the space of flat connections on a 2d surface .",
    "this 2d surface is a heegard surface defined by the structure of the defects . in our case",
    "the defects are confined to a triangulation and thus the heegard surface is specified by this triangulation as well .",
    "a 2d flat connection needs to satisfy additional flatness constraints in order to describe a ( defected ) 3d flat connection .",
    "accordingly we will discuss which class of operators defined in the 2d setting , preserve these constraints .",
    "this will lead to ( excitation generating ) operators for the 3d case . in section [ 4simplex ]",
    "we will discuss in much detail an example triangulation and the corresponding ( ribbon ) operators . in sections",
    "[ 2dstuff ] to [ 4simplex ] we will focus on hilbert spaces of gauge invariant functions and gauge invariant operators . in section [ torsion ] we will shortly discuss relaxing gauge invariance and allow another class of excitations , known as torsion ( in the gravitational context ) or electric excitations .",
    "we close with an outlook in section [ outlook ] .",
    "in this section we are going to construct hilbert spaces of functions of locally flat connections on 2d surfaces .",
    "we will furthermore describe the operators on this hilbert space and their action .",
    "later - on we will use these hilbert spaces and operators to describe the space of locally flat connections with curvature defects on 3d manifolds .      consider a closed 2d manifold @xmath2 .",
    "we are interested in the space of flat @xmath3connections on this surface .",
    "for simplicity we will assume here that @xmath3 is a finite group .",
    "about generalizations to lie groups . ]",
    "the space of flat connections on @xmath2 can be captured by choosing a directed connected graph @xmath4 embedded in @xmath2 , so that the cycles of @xmath4 capture ( at least ) the first fundamental group @xmath5 .",
    "one can then restrict the attention to the first fundmamental group @xmath6 of the graph @xmath4 equipped with additional constraints , that demand that every contractible cycle in @xmath2 carries trivial holonomy .",
    "this can be expressed as [ 2.1 ] \\ { h ( _ 1(),g ) | h(c)=",
    "c } / g where we quotient out by the diagonal adjoint action of @xmath3 .",
    "( that is , one has chosen some root node among the nodes of @xmath4 which serves as source and target nodes for the cycles of @xmath6 .",
    "the group @xmath3 acts by gauge transformations on this root and induces the diagonal adjoint action . )",
    "we want to construct a hilbert space of functions on the space of flat connections on @xmath2 .",
    "such functions can be expressed as follows : we first consider the space @xmath7 of functions @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the number of links @xmath10 in the graph @xmath4 .",
    "a graph connection is given by the assignment of group elements @xmath11 to the ( directed ) links @xmath10 of the graph @xmath4 .    to ensure that a function @xmath12 defines a consistent function on the space @xmath13 we have to impose gauge invariance .",
    "( if we include gauge invariance at the root node we will also impose invariance under the diagonal adjoint action in . )",
    "the gauge transformations act at the nodes @xmath14 of the graph @xmath4 , whose number is denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "a gauge transformation is parametrized by @xmath16 and acts on a graph connection @xmath17 as \\{u_n}_n \\{g_l}_l = \\{u^-1_t(l ) g_l u_s(l ) } _ l , where @xmath18 denotes the target node of the link @xmath10 and @xmath19 its source node .",
    "the space of gauge invariant functions , denoted by @xmath20 is the space invariant under this action for all @xmath16 .",
    "we can encode this into ( stabilizer ) constraints ( * g*_\\{u } ) \\{g } & : = & \\ { u^-1_t(l ) g_l u_s(l ) } ( g ) .",
    "each function @xmath21 defines a function @xmath22 on @xmath13 by setting ( \\ { h(c)}_c_1 ( ) ) & = & ( \\ { g_l}_l ) where @xmath17 is a graph connection so that @xmath23 for every cycle @xmath24 of the graph .",
    "the choice of the particular gauge connection @xmath17 satisfying this condition does not matter due to the gauge invariance condition .",
    "we need furthermore to impose the ( flatness ) constraints reducing @xmath13 to the space of flat connections on @xmath2 .",
    "thus for every independent cycle @xmath25 of @xmath4 that is contractible in @xmath2 we impose the condition ( * f*_c ) \\{g } : = ( , g_l_n g_l_1 ) \\{g } = \\{g } .",
    "( note that the flatness constraints are invariant under the gauge action and can therefore be imposed on @xmath20 . )",
    "this defines @xmath26 , the space of functions in @xmath20 satisfying all flatness constraints imposed by @xmath2contractible cycles .",
    "such functions define states on the configuration space given by the first fundamental group @xmath5 .    on all spaces",
    "@xmath27 we can consider the inner product given by [ innerpr ] _",
    "1 | _ 2 & = & _ g_l \\{g_l } _ 2 \\{g_l } and thus obtain the corresponding hilbert spaces @xmath28 .",
    "next we will discuss operators on the hilbert space @xmath29 of gauge invariant functions on the space of flat connections on @xmath2 .",
    "we will express these operators as operators on @xmath7 , the space of functions on graph connections .",
    "but the operators have to commute with the constraints @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which specify the space @xmath29 .",
    "one class of operators are given by wilson loop or ( closed ) holonomy operators @xmath32 which act by multiplication on states @xmath33 . to begin with let us assume that @xmath34 coincides with some closed path along the links of @xmath4 .",
    "the ( gauge invariant ) holonomy operator @xmath32",
    "is parametrized by a class function @xmath35 on the group @xmath3 and its action is given by ( w^f _ ) \\{g } = f(h _ ) \\ { g } where @xmath36 if @xmath37 .",
    "note however that as we are working with the space of flat connection , we can deform the path @xmath34 without changing the operator , that is @xmath32 only depends on the isotopy class of @xmath34 in @xmath2 . thus we can allow also paths @xmath38 not coinciding with some subset of links in @xmath4 , as we can replace such @xmath38 with some isotopy equivalent @xmath34 which runs on the graph @xmath4 .",
    "the second class of operators are known as ( exponentiated ) flux operators in loop quantum gravity , and act as translations on the arguments of the wave functions , that is as exponentiated derivative operators ( see @xcite for a precise definition for the lie group case ) .",
    "such translation operators violate in general the flatness constraints : a state satisfying the flatness constraint for a cycle @xmath39 is of the form \\{g } = ( , h_c ) \\{g } .",
    "this form would be destroyed if one of the group elements @xmath40 appearing in @xmath41 is translated .",
    "the idea is to define operators that combine a number of translations such that all holonomies associated to contractible cycles stay invariant .",
    "this is the main idea behind the ribbon operators of kitaev @xcite and leads also to the definition of so  called integrated flux operators in @xcite . in the context of @xmath0 gravity",
    "such operators ( assuming also gauge invariance can be preserved ) are dirac observables of the theory , i.e operators that commute with the constraints @xcite .",
    "we are now going to define the translation operators @xmath42 based on a closed directed and non  intersecting path @xmath43 .    to begin with",
    "we assume that the path @xmath43 is such that it intersects links of @xmath4 transversally and does avoid the nodes of the graph .",
    "( in the end the operator only depends on the isotopy class of @xmath43 . )",
    "we also assume that all crossing links have the same orientation with respect to @xmath43 : to be specific , if the direction of @xmath43 is upwards the links should cross from left to right . note that by a variable transformation @xmath44 for the wave functions we can always adjust the orientation of the links accordingly .",
    "we furthermore need to specify one link @xmath45 crossed by @xmath43 as initial link .",
    "again it will turn out that this choice does not matter for the final ( gauge invariant ) operator .    to the path",
    "@xmath43 we associate a ` shadow ' path @xmath46 which has to be isotopy equivalent to @xmath43 and to run along @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath46 is composed from links of @xmath4 .",
    "more specifically @xmath46 has to connect the target nodes of the links @xmath47 which are crossed by @xmath43 and is not allowed to cross @xmath43 itself .",
    "note that even if these condition do not seem to be satisfiable for a given path @xmath43 and a given graph @xmath4 one can refine @xmath4 to obtain an appropriate @xmath46 .",
    "we will discuss an example of this procedure in appendix [ refiningg ] . with these definitions we can picture @xmath43 and @xmath46 as the left and right boundary of a ribbon respectively .",
    "thus the right boundary of this ribbon needs to be aligned to links of the graph @xmath4 .    to define the action of the translation operator @xmath48 associated to this ribbon we denote the links crossed by the closed path @xmath43 by @xmath49 and the associated holonomies by @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore @xmath51 is the holonomy from the target node of the link @xmath52 along and in the direction of @xmath46 to the target node of @xmath45 .",
    "for @xmath53 we define @xmath54 to be the holonomy of @xmath46 starting and ending at the target node of @xmath45 .",
    "we can then define the action of the operator @xmath55 as [ deft1 ] ( t^h _ ) \\{g } & = & ( \\ { ( h_i)^-1 h^-1 h_i g_l_i } _",
    "l = l_i , \\ { g_l}_ll_i ) .",
    "this operator leaves almost all flatness constraints for the @xmath2contractible cycles intact .",
    "the exceptional cycles result from the possibility that the operator might violate the flatness condition for one face of @xmath4 , namely the face into which @xmath43 enters via crossing the ` last ' link @xmath56 .",
    "thus @xmath43 leaves the same face by crossing @xmath45 .",
    "the action of the shifts on two links usually cancels out for the face holonomy , but in this case one might encounter a non  trivial result as the holonomy @xmath57 is changed by h_f =  g_l_1 ^",
    "-1 h_n ( ) g_l_n ( )  g_l_1 ^ -1 ( h_1)^-1 h h_1 h^-1 h_n ( ) g_l_n ( ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the parallel transport for the shift of @xmath45 involves @xmath58 , that is the holonomy associated to the cylce @xmath43 , whereas the parallel transport for @xmath56 only involves @xmath59 , the holonomy from the target node of @xmath60 to the target node of @xmath45 .",
    "flatness at such a face is preserved if @xmath61 and @xmath62 do commute .",
    "one way to ensure this is to combine the translation operator @xmath42 with a holonomy operator @xmath63 with @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath61 have to commute : @xmath66 .",
    "note that now @xmath67 is , for @xmath65 not in the centre of @xmath3 , not a class function anymore and thus @xmath68 violates in general gauge invariance at the target vertex of @xmath46 .",
    "but later  on we will apply a gauge averaging procedure for the combined operators which will recover gauge invariance .",
    "the combined operators define the so  called closed ribbon operators @xcite [ rib1 ] r _ [ g , h ] & = & ( gh , hg ) w_^(g , ) t^h _ .",
    "if @xmath69 and @xmath43 ( and therefore @xmath46 ) is a contractible cycle , the ribbon operator ( [ rib1 ] ) annihilates all states in @xmath70 .",
    "if @xmath71 and @xmath43 is a contractible cycle , the ribbon operator will act as identity .",
    "we also need to insure that the ribbon operator preserves gauge invariance . in the construction of the closed ribbon",
    "we use the node @xmath72 as defining a reference system to which the translation parameter @xmath61 is transported .",
    "furthermore we have @xmath73 starting and ending at @xmath72 .",
    "thus gauge invariance will be preserved at all nodes except @xmath72 , where it might be violated .    to regain gauge invariance at this node",
    "we can apply an averaging over the gauge group , acting at this node , to the wave function resulting from the action of the ribbon operator .",
    "this gives & & _ u ( g , u h_ u^-1 ) ( \\ { ( h_i)^-1 u^-1 h^-1 u h_i g_l_i } _ l = l_i , \\ { g_l}_ll_i ) + & = & _ u ( u^-1 g u , h_ ) ( \\ { ( h_i)^-1 u^-1 h^-1 u h_i g_l_i } _ l = l_i , \\ { g_l}_ll_i ) + & = & _ u ( r _ ) ( \\{g_l}_l ) + & = : & ( r _ ) ( \\{g_l}_l ) .",
    "here we used in the first line that the initial state @xmath74 is gauge invariant , in the second line we rewrote the gauge averaging on arguments of the wave functions as a gauge averaging of the parameters @xmath75 of the ribbon .",
    "this defines ( in the last line ) an operator that only depends on the conjugacy class @xmath76 ( of @xmath61 ) and on the conjugacy class @xmath77 ( of @xmath65 ) in the stabilizer group @xmath78 of @xmath61 in @xmath3 .",
    "( remember that @xmath65 has to commute with @xmath61 , so @xmath65 is in the stabilizer group @xmath78 .",
    "furthermore we can represent @xmath79 as @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the sum over @xmath82 reduces the information about @xmath61 to the conjugacy class @xmath76 and the sum over @xmath81 reduces the information about @xmath65 to the conjugacy class @xmath77 . )",
    "the group averaging also removes the dependence of the choice of a ` first ' link @xmath45 among the links crossed by @xmath43 .",
    "we have seen that the ribbon operator preserves flatness for the contractible cycles .",
    "it can thus change only the holonomies associated to non ",
    "contractible cycles , which are crossed by @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore one can see that the action of the ribbon on the cycle holonomies is invariant under isotopic deformations of @xmath43 and thus the ribbon operator does only depend on the isotopy class of @xmath43 .",
    "ribbon operators with @xmath83 ( or @xmath84 ) with @xmath43 non  contractible will play a special role in the later discussion . in this case",
    "there is no restriction on @xmath61 or on the conjugacy class @xmath76 .",
    "in this section we are going to explain how to use the hilbert spaces and operators describing a theory of locally flat connections on a 2d surface in order to obtain a hilbert space and operators for a theory of flat connections and curvature defects on a 3d manifold .      to this end",
    "we need to review some basics on heegard splittings @xcite of 3d manifolds .",
    "let @xmath85 be a compact , closed , connected , orientable 3d manifold .",
    "such manifolds allow for heegard splittings .",
    "a heegard splitting is defined by a triple @xmath86 where @xmath87 are handlebodies in @xmath85 such that @xmath88 and @xmath2 is a closed surface embedded in @xmath85 , called the heegard surface , such that @xmath89 .",
    "handlebodies are 3d manifolds with boundaries that arise from gluing a collection of closed 3balls . this gluing is specified by choosing pairs of disks @xmath90 on the boundaries of the 3-balls that are identified with each other through a choice of homeomorphisms @xmath91 .    given @xmath85",
    "we can obtain a heegard splitting through a triangulation of @xmath85 : a regular neighbourhood of the 1skeleton of the triangulation ( that is the set of vertices and edges of the triangulation ) defines @xmath92 and the complement of @xmath92 in @xmath85 defines @xmath93 .",
    "@xmath92 can be understood as a blow  up of the one ",
    "skleleton @xmath94 of the triangulation : the blown up vertices define punctured 3balls , where the punctures arise through the ( blown up ) edges adjacent to the vertices . gluing the 3balls along the punctures as prescribed by the edges gives the handlebody @xmath92 .",
    "we want to consider the configuration space of flat connections on @xmath95 which is equivalent to the space of flat connections on @xmath93 .",
    "this space of flat connections on @xmath95 allows to have curvature defects concentrated on the edges of the triangulation , that is on @xmath94 .",
    "we aim at mapping the space of flat connections on @xmath93 to the space of flat connections on the heegard surface @xmath96 , obtained from using the triangulation @xmath97 to define the heegard splitting .",
    "clearly , a flat connection on @xmath93 is determining a flat connection on @xmath98 .    but",
    "not all flat connections on @xmath96 can be understood as flat connections on @xmath93 .",
    "in fact there are non  contractible cycles in @xmath96 that can be contracted to a point in @xmath93 . in the case that we arrived at the heegard splitting through a triangulation , a ( over ) complete basis of such cycles",
    "is given by the triangles of the triangulation in the following way :    for a given triangle @xmath99 the curve given by the intersection @xmath100 defines a cycle on @xmath96 that is contractible in @xmath93 but in general not contractible in @xmath96 .",
    "( see figure [ fsimplex ] for an example of such a curve . )",
    "thus for every triangle @xmath99 we have to impose the constraint that the holonomy associated to the curve @xmath100 is trivial .",
    "the question is then whether the set of constraints arising from the set of all triangles is sufficient to ensure that a flat connection on @xmath96 defines a flat connection on @xmath93 .",
    "this sufficiency follows from the fact that the set of triangles defines a so  called ` system of disks ' @xcite for @xmath93 : that means that cutting @xmath93 along all the cut sets @xmath101 we remain with a set of 3balls . indeed in our set  up the 3balls are in one  to ",
    "one correspondence with the tetrahedra of the triangulations .",
    "the boundaries of these 3balls can be seen as punctured spheres with the punctures given by the cut sets @xmath101 . for each 3ball the curves defined by the boundary of these punctures , that is by the sets @xmath102 ,",
    "give a ( over)complete set of curves that are contractible in the bulk of the 3ball , but not necessarily on the punctured 2sphere itself .",
    "gluing back the 3balls to @xmath93 we see that indeed taking the curves defined by @xmath103 for all triangles @xmath99 in the triangulation , gives an ( over ) complete set of cycles on @xmath96 that are contractible in @xmath93 .    as we want to represent the space of flat connections in @xmath93 we have to demand that the holonomies associated to these cycles are flat . in this way we obtain a set of flatness conditions @xmath104 , one for each triangle of the triangulation .",
    "a locally flat connection on @xmath2 , satisfying these flatness constraints , defines also a locally flat connection on @xmath93 and thus on @xmath105 .",
    "thus the space of flat connections on @xmath105 can be identified with the space of flat connections on @xmath96 with flatness conditions @xmath106 imposed .    to describe this space",
    "we construct a graph @xmath4 in @xmath96 .",
    "this graph will be not minimal , that is links can be removed without loosing information .",
    "it will however be more convenient to work with a non  minimal graph . in the following",
    "we will define this graph @xmath4 :    to begin with we describe the structure of the surface @xmath96 .",
    "a vertex @xmath107 of the triangulation @xmath97 , with @xmath108 adjacent edges , is surrounded by an @xmath108punctured sphere , which is part of @xmath96 .",
    "we will denote the sphere associated to a vertex @xmath107 by @xmath109 .",
    "the punctures of @xmath109 are due to the edges of the triangulations which are surrounded by tubular pieces @xmath110 of @xmath96 .",
    "the punctures are given by disks that are removed from the sphere and along which the tubular pieces are glued .",
    "a tubular piece is also a two  punctured sphere .",
    "note that for making the gluing well defined we need to mark a point on the boundary of each puncture : two punctures are then glued to each other by matching the marked points .",
    "we can now describe the graph @xmath4 on @xmath96 by specifying it on each of the pieces @xmath111 and @xmath109 .",
    "the tubes @xmath111 will carry just one link of the graph @xmath4 , connecting the marked point of one puncture with the marked point of the other puncture . we demand that the marked points on the punctures are in the cut set @xmath112 for one of the triangles @xmath99 adjacent to the edge @xmath113 connecting @xmath107 and @xmath114 .",
    "the link of the graph @xmath4 along the tube @xmath111 is then required to be isotopic to the curve induced by this triangle @xmath99 in @xmath111 , that is to the intersection @xmath112 .",
    "this requirement avoids a winding of the links around the tubes , as compared to the curves @xmath115 .",
    "we call @xmath116 the holonomy associated to the link of the graph on the tube @xmath111 , going from @xmath114 to @xmath107 .    for a sphere @xmath109 we choose a position for an @xmath108valent node @xmath117 of the graph @xmath4 and connect this node by",
    "intersecting links to all the marked points on the boundary of the disks , representing the @xmath108 punctures , see figure [ hspheres ] .",

    "we now aim at finding operators in @xmath128 , that is operators acting on functions on the space of flat connections on @xmath96 which in addtion leave the triangle - flatness constraints invariant .    one class of operators , for which this holds are wilson loop operators : these act by multiplication on the function space of holonomies and thus commute with any flatness constraints .",
    "another class is given by a special kind of ( gauge averaged ) closed ribbon operators @xmath131 $ ] discussed in section [ ribbonop ] .",
    "we remind the reader that the ribbon operators are associated to a closed path @xmath43 and its shadow @xmath46 , which needs to go along the graph @xmath4 .",

    "we furthermore gauge averaged the ribbon operators to avoid a possible violation of gauge invariance .",
    "in addition we need to ensure that the ribbon operator leaves the flatness constraints @xmath104 invariant . to this end",

    "furthermore the closed curves @xmath115 and @xmath137 for two different triangles @xmath99 and @xmath138 do not intersect each other on @xmath96 . thus even if @xmath135 $ ] goes along a curve @xmath43 that does intersect @xmath137 it has to intersect it an even number of times as @xmath43 needs to be isotopy equivalent to @xmath115 which does not intersect @xmath137 .",
    "hence the holonomy associated to @xmath137 ( or to a curve isotopy equivalent to @xmath137 ) will not be affected by the translational part of the action of @xmath135 $ ] .",
    "we can thus associated to each triangle @xmath99 ribbon operators @xmath135 $ ] , labelled by a conjugacy class @xmath76 of @xmath3 .",
    "this ribbon operator changes the holonomies around the edges bounding the triangle @xmath99 .",
    "this is the same action as for the ( gauge averaged ) integrated flux operator associated to a triangle @xmath99 and defined in @xcite .",
    "we can also consider ribbon operators associated to more general curves than thus arising from one triangle @xmath99 : for instance we can take two adjacent triangles @xmath139 and consider their induced curves @xmath102 and @xmath140 .",
    "we can then isotopically deform e.g. @xmath140 to a curve @xmath141 such that @xmath141 agrees with @xmath102 on the part of the curve running on the tube @xmath142 surrounding the edge shared by @xmath99 and @xmath138 .",
    "this defines a merging of the curves @xmath102 and @xmath141 , denoted by @xmath143 and given by the set @xmath144 .    we can then consider a ribbon operator @xmath145 $ ] associated to the curve @xmath143 .",
    "this ribbon operator will shift the @xmath146holonomies around the edges adjacent to the triangles @xmath99 and @xmath138 but for the one edge shared by @xmath99 and @xmath138 and along which we merged the two triangle curves to one curve .",
    "( even if the two triangles have more than one edge in common it might not be possible to merge further parts of their curve , see the following discussion . )",
    "this procedure of merging the curves induced by the triangles can be generalized to an arbitrary number of triangles . in this way we can consider ribbon operators associated to curves going around a number of triangles .",
    "note however that it is _ in general not _ possible to merge the curves arising from triangles meeting at a vertex @xmath107 , so that the merged curve does not visit @xmath109 anymore",
    ". there might be punctures on @xmath109 ( resulting from further edges adjacent to @xmath107 ) preventing such a merging .",
    "one can nevertheless consider a curve , e.g. resulting from the maximally possible merging of three triangles @xmath147 meeting at a vertex .",
    "however even if the three triangles close around a vertex @xmath107 to a surface we might not be able to merge the three triangles along all the ( three ) shared edges .",
    "that is the merged path will have to include two parts along the same tube @xmath142 surrounding one of the shared edges : the path has to go on this tube @xmath142 to @xmath109 , encircle some punctures on @xmath109 and then come back again via the tube @xmath142 .",
    "( we will discuss such a case in section [ 4simplex ] . )",
    "thus also the ribbon associated to such a merged path has to go back and forth along the tube @xmath142 .",
    "this can then have a non  trivial action on the @xmath146holonomy going around the tube , as the translational action of the two pieces of the ribbon differ by the holonomies picked up by going around the punctures on @xmath109 .",
    "in short we see that the ribbon operators associated to the merging of several triangle curves will not only depend on the triangles itself , but also on the details on how we merge the associated triangle curves .",
    "this determines along which path the group element @xmath61 is parallel transported , by which we translate each of the holonomies that are crossed by the ribbon .",
    "note that this dependence does also appear for the integrated flux operators in @xmath1d defined in @xcite .",
    "there the exponentiated flux operators are associated to a surface glued from triangles .",
    "but for each such surface we have also to specify a ` surface tree ' that describes the parallel transport of the translational parameter @xmath61 for each of the triangles of the surface .    in both , the heegard surface and the 3d description",
    ", we can also consider a closed surface made out of triangles .",
    "however , for the reasons discussed above , in the ribbon case we will in general _ not _ be able to merge the curves induced by the triangles , so that the merged curve is equivalent to a contractible curve on @xmath96 and the associated ribbon therefore trivial . we will rather have a merged curve visiting some or ( in general ) all of the spheres @xmath109 associated to the vertices @xmath107 adjacent to the triangles making up the glued surface .",
    "in general the closed surface made out of triangles is cut open by a connected and spanning tree made out of the edges of the surface .",
    "the merged curve runs along the tubes surrounding the edges of the tree and furthermore traverses these tubes twice in opposite directions .",
    "the action of the ribbon associated to the merged curve is only non  trivial because of the difference in parallel transport for the two parts of the curve traversing each tube .",
    "also the exponentiated flux operators associated to closed surfaces as defined in @xcite have in general a non  trivial action due to the difference in parallel transport along some cut of the surface .",
    "this difference is only relevant if there is curvature , and , as the closed surface operators measure torsion , this effect has been named curvature induced torsion in @xcite .",
    "as an example we consider the three  sphere @xmath148 triangulated by the boundary of a 4simplex @xmath149 .",
    "we can identify @xmath148 with the compactified space @xmath150 .",
    "this allows us to think of the boundary of the 4simplex as embedded into @xmath150 .",
    "the one  skeleton of the triangulation agrees then with the one  skeleton obtained by subdividing one tetrahedron into four tetrahedra , see figure [ fsimplex ] .",
    "the four tetrahedra agree with four of the five tetrahedra of the 4simplex , the fifth tetrahedron is given by the outside region of the subdivided tetrahedron ( or by the complement of the subdivided tetrahededron in @xmath148 ) .",
    "we now have to consider a regular neighbourhood of the one  skeleton , that is blow  up the one  skeleton to a handlebody .",
    "we are interested in the boundary of this handlebody which defines a heegard surface @xmath96 , depicted in figure [ fsimplex ] .    on this surface",
    "@xmath96 we have to choose a graph as described in section [ graph ] .",
    "as described there we can construct this graph separately on the ( punctured ) spheres and on the tubes of the heegard surfaces @xmath96 .",
    "the tubes just carry one link of the graph that has to coincide with the part of a curve @xmath102 induced by one of the triangles . for each edge of the triangulation , that is for each tube of the heegard surface , we have therefore to select one triangle @xmath99 adjacent to this edge .",
    "we make the following choice : for the edges of the subdivided tetrahedron we choose the links to go along the inside facing part of the tubes .",
    "that is for an edge @xmath151 with @xmath152 we choose the triangle @xmath153 . for an edges @xmath154 with @xmath155 we choose the triangle @xmath156 . and",
    "for the edge @xmath157 we choose the triangle @xmath158 .     +    it is more involved to decide on a graph for the punctured spheres around each vertex .",
    "but here we can actually draw the punctured spheres ( in a planar way ) associated to each vertex , see figure [ fcrit ] . in all cases we have four  punctured spheres .",
    "the four punctures are forming the four vertices of a flattened ( on top view of a ) tetrahedron .",
    "the edges of this ( auxiliary ) tetrahedron do indeed represent the curves resulting from the triangles of the triangulation cutting the punctured sphere in question .    with our choice of links along the tubes connecting the spheres",
    "we have also chosen the ` marked points ' of the punctures , that is the point on the boundary of the puncture at which the link coming from the tube will emerge . for each punctured sphere we have to choose one node and four links connecting this node to the marked points on the punctures .",
    "we present such a choice in figure [ fcrit ] .",
    "there is one further choice to make , namely how to isotop the parts of the curves resulting from triangles cutting the heegard surfaces , which do not run already along the links of the graphs .",
    "( this has to be done in particular for the part of the curves running along the tubes . )",
    "we indicate in figure [ fcrit ] in which way the triangle curves are isotoped around the punctures of a given sphere .",
    "let us consider the sphere @xmath159 associated to the vertex @xmath160 in more detail .",
    "( as we have made all choices similar for the other spheres the same conclusions will hold there . )",
    "the four punctures of the sphere can be labelled by the vertices which are connected ( through tubes ) to these punctures . in trying to construct a path along the graph which is isotopic to the curve induced by a given triangle we have to be careful in how the triangle curve , which emerges from one puncture and goes to another one , surrounds the remaining punctures .",
    "for instance we see that the curve given by @xmath161 is isotopic to the following path along the graph @xmath4 : we follow the link from puncture @xmath162 to the 4valent ` central ' node @xmath163 and then follow the link to the marked point of the puncture @xmath164 .",
    "this holds also for the triangles @xmath165 .",
    "that is for four out of six triangles we can just follow the canonical path along the graph . ( note that this holds only for the corners of the triangles at @xmath160 , the same triangles will in general involve more complicated paths at other vertices . ) to get however a path along the graph that is isotopic to @xmath166 , we do however have to  in addition to the link from @xmath162 to @xmath163 and from @xmath163 to @xmath167  include a cycle around the puncture @xmath168 . also for the triangle @xmath169 we have to include a cycle around the puncture @xmath168 itself .",
    "in fact for each of the five spheres we have four triangles which induce curves which are already isotopic to the canonical path along the graph . for the remaining two triangles we need however to include a cycle around a puncture , which is always the central puncture in the figures [ fcrit ] .",
    "+ let us summarize our notation for the different kinds of holonomies along the heegard surface : for @xmath170 we define k_ij & & + g_ij & & + & & + h_ij & & .",
    "we can absorb the @xmath171 holonomies into the @xmath172 and @xmath146 holonomies g_ij & = & k^-1_ij g_ij k_ji , + h_ij & = & k_ij^-1 h_ij k_ij . this way",
    "the @xmath173 and @xmath174 holonomies start and end at the ` central ' nodes @xmath175",

    "with @xmath176 we denote the curve starting at vertex @xmath177 going to vertex @xmath178 , then @xmath171 and then back to @xmath177 .",
    "the flatness constraints induced by the triangles are as follows : [ 4.3 ] & t(231 ) : g_12 g_23 g_31 = , & t(125):g_25 g_51 g_12 h_25 = , + & t(514 ) : g_45 g_51 g_14 = , & t(234):g_34 g_42 g_23",

    "the heegard splitting can be based on a triangulation ( or other polyhedral lattice ) , the curvature defects are then confined to the one  skeleton of this triangulation . the theory of flat connections on the 3d manifold can then be described in terms of the theory of flat connections on the 2d heegard surface , but equipped with additional flatness constraints . in particular we can express operators generating curvature defects for the 3d theory as ( ribbon ) operators acting on the space of flat connections on the 2d surface , satisfying the additional flatness constraints .",

    "the geometrical interpretation of this representation has to be explored , we conjecture that , as in the @xmath0 dimensional case , states are peaked almost everywhere on homogeneously curved geometry .",
    "as such this new representation would incorporate a cosmological constant and realize a homogeneously curved version of regge calculus constructed in @xcite .    there is an interesting connection to recent work by haggard , han , kaminski and riello @xcite , which constructs spin foam amplitudes for quantum gravity incorporating a cosmological constant .",

    ". a further topic of future research will be the construction of time evolution : this can either involve a fixed 3d triangulation evolving in time , or , as discussed in @xcite an evolution with a time varying triangulation .",
    "the latter would mean that the topology of the heegard surface changes during ( discrete ) time evolution .",
    "different possibilities also exist for the type of dynamics : one can either implement a 4d tqft with non  interacting defects . in this case the dynamics would be given by further constraints ( or stabilizers ) : these would require flatness for all edges of the triangulation not carrying a defect and prescribe the curvature around the edges carrying a defect .",
    "see for instance @xcite for the exploration of bf theory with string  like defects .",
    "alternatively one can aim at an interacting theory , such as 4d gravity .",
    "in fact we hope that the bf representation constructed in @xcite as well as the turaev - viro representation @xcite and its possible generalization to @xmath1d based on the work presented here , will give an interesting starting point for constructing the dynamics of 4d quantum gravity .",

    "we can now define a ribbon which crosses the subdivided links but where the path @xmath46 now avoids all links crossed by the ribbon , or more precisely @xmath43 .",
    "we can work out the action of the ribbon ( parametrized by a translation @xmath61 and w.l.o.g .",
    "ending at the source node of the link belonging to @xmath265 ) on these holonomies : a & & [ ( h_ij)^-1 c^-1 k_ij ] h^-1 [ ( k_ij)^-1 c h_ij ] a + b & & [ ( h_ij)^-1 c^-1 k_ij ] h^-1 [ ( k_ij)^-1 c h_ij ] b .",
    "thus the original variables are shifted by h_ij & & [ ( h_ij)^-1 k_ij ] h^-1 [ ( k_ij)^-1 h_ij ] h_ij + k_ij & & [ ( h_ij)^-1 k_ij ] h^-1 [ ( k_ij)^-1 h_ij ] k_ij .",
    "we have indeed in the expression for the parallel transport ( in square bracket ) for the shift parameter @xmath61 , the shifted variables @xmath188 and @xmath265 itself appearing . but",
    "this happens in a combination , that is invariant under the shift .",
    "thus the action of the ribbon is well defined .",
