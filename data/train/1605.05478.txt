    "non - separability in classical light fields has been studied recently in the context of quantum information and entanglement@xcite .",
    "this non - separability is analogous to intra - system entanglement involving different degrees of freedom of a light beam .",
    "however , the term `` classical entanglement '' has received some serious criticism recently @xcite .",
    "the non - separability can exist in between continuous or discrete variables , for which the classical light beams are shown to violate the corresponding form of the bell s inequality @xcite .",
    "one can construct classical equivalent of many exotic quantum states using polarization and spatial modes of light .",
    "these non separable states are used to mimic many quantum protocols @xcite .",
    "apart from the basic interest of demonstrating quantum protocols using classical light beams , they find applications in various fields@xcite .",
    "these non - separable states are shown to be robust under scattering and used to show the phase recovery of a beam after scattering @xcite .",
    "when light fields undergo a cyclic polarization evolution , they acquire a geometric phase which is known as pancharatnam phase @xcite .",
    "the phase acquired by the light depends on the path taken by the polarization state upon its evolution on the poincar sphere .",
    "the geometric phase is generalized to any quantum system under cyclic evolution by a time dependent hamiltonian and called as the berry phase@xcite .",
    "entangled states , when generated experimentally , may possess a relative phase due to the phase delays in the generating process .",
    "one can nullify this relative phase by introducing a geometric phase in one of the subsystem .",
    "in such cases , we need to see the bell violation , as a measure of entanglement , to optimize the state corresponding to different relative phases . the effect of berry phase in entangled systems and their violation of bell s inequality were studied for spin-@xmath0 particles@xcite .",
    "the measurement in two degrees of freedom of non - separable state , be it classical or quantum , is very important for various protocols .",
    "any relative phase will change the measurement outcome which will affect the efficiency of the protocol .",
    "thus optimizing the measurements in two degrees of freedom , when the state acquires a relative phase is very important for efficient implementation of such protocols . here",
    ", we introduce pancharatnam geometric phase to the non - separable state in a controlled way and show that a proper selection of measurement basis can make the bell measurement phase independent .    in this article",
    ", we generate a classical non - separable bell - like state of polarization and orbital angular momentum ( oam ) of light using a polarizing sagnac interferometer .",
    "we demonstrate the presence of non - separability by the violation of bell s inequality for the generated state .",
    "next , we study the effect of pancharatnam phase introduced by the polarization subsystem , through its cyclic evolution on the poincar sphere , on the violation of bell s inequality . the maximum violation @xmath1 varies sinusoidally according to the pancharatnam phase when maximized over the set of linear bases .",
    "we experimentally show that the bell parameter can obtain its maximum value of @xmath2 irrespective of the pancharatnam phase if we introduce a corresponding relative phase in the projecting basis .",
    "we also investigate the effect of pancharatnam phase on the spatially varying polarization structure of these non - separable beams .",
    "the result give insight to the measurement optimization of bell chsh inequality for a non - separable state under different relative phase .    in section [ sc.2",
    "] , we give a theoretical background for the problem .",
    "we are using dirac notation for the representation of states .",
    "however it is to be noted that the state correspond to classical electromagnetic fields and also we have omitted the normalization by total intensity for the convenience of representation . in section [ sc.3 ] we describe the experimental details for the generation , evolution and measurement of the non - separable state of light .",
    "we also give the holograms for the oam measurements .",
    "the results and discussion are given in section [ sc.4 ] .",
    "along with the projective measurement results , we give the stokes polarimetric images of the beam for different pancharatnam phase which can give a physical explanation for the variation of @xmath1 and the bases adjustments .",
    "we finally conclude in section [ sc.5 ] .",
    "we start with a maximally non - separable bell - like state of polarization and oam that can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are basis vectors for 2d complex vector spaces of polarization and oam .",
    "we define the set of linear bases corresponding to polarization and oam as @xmath6    these bases are represented geometrically as blue circles on the poincar sphere of polarization and that of oam as given in fig .",
    "the bell - chsh inequality is defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 @xmath9 is the probability amplitude of a state for being in @xmath10 .",
    "projecting the state given in eq . [ 1 ] to a general state @xmath10 in the linear bases of polarization and oam we get @xmath11    using above expression in eq .",
    "[ 4 ] , one can obtain @xmath12 at @xmath13 .",
    "note that the maximization is done over states in the linear bases of polarization and oam by changing @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .     and @xmath16 are oam states corresponding to the topological charge + 2 and -2 respectively .",
    "also @xmath17 and @xmath18 . ]",
    "now , consider a cyclic evolution of polarization for the state given in eq .",
    "[ 1 ] which can be done by action of half wave plate ( h ) oriented at @xmath19 with the horizontal , quarter wave plate ( q ) oriented at @xmath20 and another half wave plate at @xmath21 . here ,",
    "the two orthogonal polarization states evolve as @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "thus the state becomes    @xmath24    where @xmath25 .",
    "the joint measurement probability becomes @xmath26 which is a function of @xmath27 also .",

    "for @xmath1 with @xmath30 , @xmath15 and @xmath29 are varied as @xmath31 the @xmath1 varies periodically with the relative phase @xmath27 .        to get back the maximum bell violation , one need to use different bases for the maximization of the bell parameter .",
    "we redefine the oam projecting state as @xmath32 that gives @xmath33 one can obtain the same by introducing a relative phase in polarization state @xmath34 too . now",
    "the bell - chsh parameter @xmath1 is independent of the relative phase @xmath27 .",
    "the different oam measurement bases for different @xmath27 are given in fig .",
    "[ fg.2 ] .",

    "the states are given as @xmath36 these measurement bases are given as red circles in fig.[fg.1 ] .",
    "measuring the state @xmath37 will result the same outcome as given in eq . [ 2 ] .",
    "now the joint detection probability for the projection of the state @xmath35 to state @xmath10 is given as @xmath38 thus with @xmath39 and @xmath40 we can obtain the bell - chsh parameter as @xmath2 .",
    "the experimental set up used to generate the non - separable state and to study its properties is shown in fig .",
    "we have used a diode pumped solid state green laser ( verdi 10 ) with vertical polarization for our study .",
    "the laser beam passes through a half wave plate oriented at @xmath41 with the horizontal that changes the polarization from vertical to diagonal .",
    "then it passes through a polarizing sagnac interferometer containing a spiral phase plate ( spp ) to generate a light beam with non - separable polarization and oam .",
    "two orthogonally polarized ( h and v ) counter propagating gaussian beams are converted into optical vortices of orders @xmath42 ( for h ) and @xmath43 ( for v ) by the spp designed for order @xmath44 .",
    "these orthogonally polarized and oppositely charged vortices superpose at the same pbs to form the non - separable state .     for the measurements of oam states in linear bases ]    for the polarization evolution",
    "we have introduced a simon - mukunda ( sm ) gadget @xcite , a combination of two quarter wave plates ( q ) and a half wave plate ( h ) in q - h - q order . a quarter wave plate with fast axis oriented at @xmath21 with the horizontal convert the horizontal and vertical polarizations into right and left circular polarizations respectively .",
    "now a half wave plate will convert right circular polarization to left circular polarization and vice - versa .",
    "the second quarter wave plate at @xmath21 will convert the circular polarization to the initial linear polarization state .",
    "but the evolution on the poincar sphere takes different path according to the fast axis orientation angle ( @xmath45 ) of the half wave plate . the polarization evolution is also given in fig .",
