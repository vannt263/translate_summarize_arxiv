    "the familiar phase boundaries that delineate solids , liquids and gases are , of course , associated with non - analyticities of the free energy .",
    "however , there are other lines in the phase diagram where structural characteristics of the material change abruptly . for example",
    ", in one - component fluids the fisher - widom line distinguishes the region where the density - density ( pair ) correlation function exhibits damped oscillatory decay at large separations , characteristic of dense liquids , from that where the decay is monotonic , characteristic of gases and near critical fluids  @xcite . in nature",
    "most materials are mixtures and increasing the number of components ( species ) leads to increasingly rich phase behaviour that is accompanied by further crossover lines .",
    "the most basic structural crossover in a binary mixture is predicted to occur when the dominant wavelength of oscillations in the pair correlation functions changes , from big to small , upon changing the composition  @xcite ; this crossover is amenable to experimental investigation and is the subject of our study .",
    "the binary hard sphere model is the key reference system for a simple liquid mixture , i.e. a mixture of two species of atoms or small molecules , since the structure of such mixtures is determined primarily by the repulsive forces acting between the atoms and these can be approximated by hard spheres  @xcite .",
    "at longer length scales , binary mixtures of colloidal particles immersed in a solvent can be prepared for which the effective colloidal interactions are , to an good approximation , hard sphere - like  @xcite .",
    "here we investigate such a colloidal system , using particle - resolved studies to extract pair - correlation functions  @xcite , and test theoretical and simulation predictions  @xcite for fundamental features of the structure of binary mixtures .",
    "we focus on a hard sphere mixture of big ( _ b _ ) and small ( _ s _ ) particles , characterized by the size ratio @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denote the hard sphere diameters , and the packing ( or volume ) fractions @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the existence of two length scales , associated with the two diameters , points to the possibility of physical phenomena associated with competition between these . in the supercooled liquid",
    ", this competition can be used to suppress crystalisation @xcite . in the hard sphere crystalline state",
    "this competition gives rise to a wide variety of different phases , characterized by different crystal structures  @xcite .    in the fluid state",
    "the competition leads to structural crossover revealed by considering the asymptotic decay , @xmath4 , of the primary structural indicator , the pair correlation function @xmath5 between species @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath5 are , of course , determined by the interaction potentials and a powerful means of analysing the nature of their decay is via a pole analysis of the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) equations of liquid state theory @xcite . we know from very general considerations of the mixture oz equations in fourier space  @xcite , that for short - ranged interparticle potentials the ultimate decay of all three pair correlation functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 will be exponentially damped oscillatory with a common decay length @xmath10 the true correlation length of the mixture and a common oscillatory wave length @xmath11  @xcite",
    "specifically we expect the total correlation functions @xmath12 to decay as @xmath13 for @xmath14 with @xmath15 . only the amplitudes @xmath16 and the phases @xmath17 are species dependent and there are symmetry relations between these  @xcite .",

    "intuitively , we expect the ( common ) wavelength of the oscillations to be approximately the diameter of the big species .",

    "is there a sharp line , in the @xmath2 versus @xmath3 phase diagram , delineating a structural crossover whereby the wavelength of the longest ranged oscillations changes discontinuously ?",
    "theory , based on a general pole analysis of the oz equations , points to a _",
    "sharp _ structural crossover line and for ( additive ) hard spheres the line has been calculated explicitly within the percus - yevick ( py ) and density functional theory ( dft ) approximations  @xcite . by sharp crossover",
    "we mean there is a line in the phase diagram where the wavelength of the slowest oscillatory decay of @xmath5 switches discontinuously from one value to another .",
    "although the @xmath5 obtained from monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of hard spheres in 3d  @xcite and of hard discs in 2d  @xcite are close to those from theory , simple visual inspection of @xmath30 is not sufficient to confirm a sharp crossover .",
    "in fact we shall show that demonstrating a sharp crossover requires determination of @xmath18 and @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ eqh ] ) in order to demonstrate a ( sharp ) change in the leading order pole controlling asymptotic behavior . while particle resolved experiments on mixtures",
    "have been performed previously @xcite , obtaining the level of accuracy sufficient for the pole analysis is challenging @xcite . here",
    "we show that it is possible to apply this pole analysis to experimental data and thereby provide compelling experimental evidence for a sharp crossover .",
    "we emphasize that the prediction of a sharp structural crossover transition is in no sense particular to hard spheres ; it should be found for a very wide class of mixtures where the two species are of different sizes and the interparticle forces are short - ranged  @xcite .",
    "significantly the same general argument for crossover pertains for a confined binary mixture , where one expects to see manifestations of structural crossover in the oscillatory ( solvation ) force arising from confinement between substrates @xcite , and for the oscillatory one - body density profiles at interfaces @xcite . specifically , the same ( true ) correlation length @xmath31 and wavelength @xmath32 appearing in eq .",

    "we also note that the true correlation length is important in current research on the glass transition @xcite .    a previous study , carried out by baumgartl _ _ et al.__@xcite , on a binary mixture of small and big colloidal particles with size ratio @xmath33 provided some evidence for structural crossover and attempted to relate crossover to the sizes of networks containing connected big or connected small particles .",
    "however , ref.@xcite could image only the first 2d colloidal layer next to the bottom wall of the sample and data analysis was performed from a 2d perspective .",
    "moreover the pole analysis mentioned above was not employed so the authors were not able to ascertain the nature of crossover  @xcite . a later x - ray diffraction and microscopy study on monolayers of bimodal nanoparticles reported packing structures resembling what might be expected for structural crossover  @xcite .",

    "<S> for binary fluid mixtures of spherical particles in which the two species are sufficiently different in size , the dominant wavelength of oscillations of the pair correlation functions is predicted to change from roughly the diameter of the large species to that of the small species along a sharp crossover line in the phase diagram [ c. grodon , m. dijkstra , r. evans & r. roth , j.chem.phys . * </S>",
