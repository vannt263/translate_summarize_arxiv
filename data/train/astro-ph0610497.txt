    "several resonances of this kind are possible and have been discussed ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "formulae for the keplerian @xmath5 and the epicyclic frequencies @xmath1 and @xmath3 in the field of a kerr black hole with mass @xmath6 and spin @xmath7 are well known , and have the general form @xmath8 where @xmath9 are functions of a dimensionless black hole spin @xmath7 and a dimensioless radial coordinate . for a @xmath10 orbital resonance , the dimensionless resonance radius @xmath11 is determined as a function of spin @xmath7 by an equation @xmath12 .",
    ", however this sensitivity can be negligible on large scales of mass ( @xcite ) .",

    "note that while the spin estimates from the 3:2 parametric resonance is for both the cases similar ( @xmath17 ) , for the other models , the given mass range implies a large range of spins .",
    "except for one case , all the resonances considered in @xcite are consistent with reasonable values of the black hole spin covering the range @xmath18 . in particular ,",
    "the 3:2 epicyclic parametric ( internal ) resonance model , supposed to be the most natural one in einstein gravity @xcite , implies the spin @xmath19 .",
    "the most recent results of the spectral fits correspond for gro  165540   to the spin @xmath20 , and for grs  1915 + 105 to @xmath21 @xcite . obviously , the value for grs  1915 + 105 is in agreement with the prediction of the 3:2 parametric epicyclic resonance model , but the same prediction for gro  165540 does not match the spectral fitting .",
    "no particular resonance model considered so far can cover the spectral limits to the spin for both microquasars .",
    "it could be interesting that the recently proposed 3:2 periastron precession resonance @xcite implies the spin of gro  165540 to be @xmath22 .",
    "nevertheless , eventuall periastron precession resonance requires the spin of grs  1915 + 105 @xmath23 which is in strong disagreement with the spectral fitting limit , @xmath21 .",
    "in principle one can not exlude the possibility of different mechanisms exciting the high frequency qpos in different sources , but there are many indicies that the mechanism is the same or similar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite found that the upper qpo frequency in microquasars scales well as @xmath24 which is in good agreement with the 1@xmath25 scaling of the first term in equation ( [ eq : oneoverm : theory ] ) .    on the other hand",
    "the exact 1@xmath25 scaling holds only for the fixed value of the spin @xmath7 as functions @xmath26 in equation ( [ eq : oneoverm : theory ] ) are sensitive to the spin .",
    "the spectral limits to the spin for the two microquasars are _ very different _ : @xmath27 vs. @xmath21 , and , in addition , functions @xmath28 are more sensitive to the value of the spin when it is close to @xmath29 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , if the spin values obtained from the spectral fits are correct , the observed high frequency qpos do not show sensitivity to the spin @xmath7 under the assumption of a unified qpo model .",
    "this is a serious problem for any relativistic qpo model handling with the orbital and epicyclic frequencies ( [ eq : oneoverm : theory ] ) .",
    "it was found recently that the pressure effects may have a strong influence on the oscillation frequencies . @xcite and",
    "@xcite studied properties of the radial ad vertical epicyclic modes of slightly non - slender tori within newtonian theory using the paczyski - wiita potential , and found the epicyclic frequencies to decrease with increasing thickness of the torus .",
    "the same behaviour was found for the resonant radius where the frequencies are in a 3:2 ratio , which on the contrary implies _ increase _ of the resonant frequencies .",
    "considering the appropriate corrections to frequencies in the kerr metric , one can reestimate the values of the spin using the resonance model .",
    "if the results in the kerr metric were following the same trend as those in the paczyski - wiita case , the spin for some configurations can be _ lower _ than previously estimated.0.8 . ]      , 2001 , a&a 374l , 19a , astro - ph/010507 , 2004 , aip conference proceedings , vol .",
