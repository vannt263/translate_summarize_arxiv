    "ly@xmath0  absorption by neutral hydrogen along the line of sight to distant quasars provides a sensitive probe of the cosmic distribution of diffuse gas over a wide range of redshifts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in recent years",
    ", the keck telescope s hires spectrograph ( @xcite ) has revolutionized the study of the ly@xmath0   forest \" at redshifts @xmath11 , yielding high - resolution spectra of spectacular precision ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; kim 1997 , hereafter @xcite ; @xcite ) . at the same time , the uv spectroscopic capabilities of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) have made it possible to study the ly@xmath0  forest from @xmath12 down to @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , the hst quasar absorption line key project team has used the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) to conduct a comprehensive census of low redshift ly@xmath0  lines , especially those with rest - frame equivalent width @xmath13 , examining statistical quantities such as the distribution of equivalent widths , @xmath14 , and the evolution of the number of lines per unit redshift above an equivalent width threshold , @xmath1(@xcite , 1996 ; @xcite ; weymann 1998 , hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "other groups have used the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) to study weaker lines toward a smaller number of quasars ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; shull , stocke & penton 1996 , hereafter @xcite ; tripp , lu , & savage 1998 , hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "future observations with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) and the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) should yield more extensive samples of weak low - redshift lines .    concurrently with these observational developments , cosmological simulations that incorporate gravity , gas dynamics , radiative cooling , and photoionization",
    "have shown that theoretical models based on inflation and cold dark matter ( cdm ) can reproduce many of the observed properties of the high - redshift ( @xmath5 ) ly@xmath0  forest ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xciteb ) .",
    "these theoretical models were originally introduced to account for the observed properties of galaxies , large scale structure , and cosmic microwave background anisotropies , so their success in explaining an entirely different class of observational phenomena provides important support for at least the broad features of the cdm scenario .",
    "the simulations lead to a physical picture in which most of the optically thin or marginally saturated lines at high redshift ( those with neutral hydrogen column densities @xmath15 ) arise in structures that are only a few times the cosmic mean density and are therefore far from dynamical or thermal equilibrium .",
    "the physics of the diffuse intergalactic medium ( igm ) that produces this low column density absorption is relatively simple , so this model of the high - redshift ly@xmath0  forest can be described with surprising accuracy by straightforward analytic or numerical approximations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; weinberg , katz , & hernquist 1998b ) .",
    "in this paper we use smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations to extend these numerical studies to @xmath3 , employing a newly developed parallel version ( @xcite ) of our simulation code treesph ( @xcite ; katz , weinberg , & hernquist 1996 , hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "we consider four variants of the cdm scenario ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , two with @xmath16 and two with @xmath17 .",
    "however , in this paper we focus on understanding the physics of the low-@xmath18 forest rather than distinguishing between cosmological models .",
    "the ly@xmath0  forest is a promising new arena for cosmological tests , but these require a careful match between theoretical and observational analyses that is beyond the scope of the present study . we plan to pursue such comparisons at both low and high redshift in future work . at various points in the paper , we will compare our results to those of other numerical investigations of the low - redshift forest : riediger , petitjean , & mcket ( 1998 ) , who use a modified n - body method , and theuns , leonard , & efstathiou ( 1998a ) , who use sph simulations .    a surprise in the very first spectra of the low - redshift ly@xmath0",
    "forest was the discovery of many more lines than expected from an extrapolation of high - redshift data ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the implied change in the rate of evolution of the forest has now been precisely quantified by the key project team ( @xcite ) . adopting sargent",
    "et al.s ( 1980 ) parameterization of the evolution , @xmath19 @xcite find @xmath20 for a sample of nearly 500 lines with @xmath13  in the spectra of 62 quasars with @xmath21 .",
    "ground - based studies imply much steeper evolution at @xmath5 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , with the most recent results coming from the keck / hires observations of @xcite , which yield @xmath22 . combining the hst and",
    "ground - based results implies a sharp break in the evolution of @xmath1   at @xmath9 , which is further supported by @xcite s analysis of the quasar um 18 at @xmath23 .",
    "the break in evolution has led to the suggestion that there are two distinct populations of ly@xmath0  absorbers , one ( perhaps associated with filaments and sheets ) evolving rapidly and being dominant at high @xmath18 , and the other ( perhaps associated with galaxy halos ) evolving slowly and being dominant at low @xmath18 ( e.g. , @xcite , 1996 , who also discuss other possible causes for the break in @xmath1  evolution ) .",
    "the idea of an association between ly@xmath0  absorbers and gaseous halos of galaxies has a long history ( e.g. , bahcall & spitzer 1969 )",
    ". one important practical virtue of low-@xmath18 forest studies is that follow - up observations can examine the relation between ly@xmath0  absorbers and the neighboring galaxies and large scale structure .",
    "for example , lanzetta ( 1995 , hereafter @xcite ) and chen ( 1998 , hereafter @xcite ) have conducted deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys of galaxies in key project fields and find that galaxies with impact parameters @xmath24 almost always have an associated absorption line with @xmath25 , but that galaxies with @xmath26 almost never do ( @xmath27 is the projected distance from the galaxy to the quasar line of sight ) .",
    "they also find a trend of increasing ly@xmath0  equivalent width with decreasing galaxy impact parameter , a correlation that has been extended to larger @xmath27 and smaller @xmath28 by @xcite ( who add a cautionary discussion of selection biases that could artificially amplify the apparent trend ) . on this basis ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite argue that most , and perhaps all ly@xmath0  absorbers with @xmath29  arise in extended gaseous envelopes surrounding galaxies , with typical radii @xmath30 ( weakly dependent on galaxy luminosity ) .",
    "however , numerous studies show that there are some ly@xmath0  absorbers with no luminous galaxy nearby ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) even with impressively deep imaging ( @xcite ) .",
    "comparison to wide - angle galaxy redshift surveys shows that some weak ly@xmath0  absorbers reside in large scale voids of the galaxy distribution ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "statistical analyses show that the low-@xmath18 ly@xmath0  absorbers are not randomly distributed with respect to galaxies , but they also show that the cross - correlation between absorbers and galaxies is not as strong as the correlation of galaxies with themselves ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and that the galaxy density around absorbers is lower than the galaxy density around galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "these analyses have led many of the above authors ( and others as well ) to suggest that low-@xmath18 ly@xmath0  forest absorption is produced not by individual galaxies but by larger scale gaseous structures that the galaxies themselves reside in , with some tendency for weak absorbers to avoid high density regions and favor low density regions .",
    "given this observational background , we began our theoretical investigation of the low-@xmath18 ly@xmath0  forest with several interlocking questions in mind .",
    "first , can the simulations account for the observed break in @xmath1   evolution at @xmath9 , and if so , what is the mechanism causing the break ?",
    "second , are the physical structures that produce the ly@xmath0  forest the same at high and low redshift , or is there a transition from one population of absorbers to another ?",
    "third , if the low redshift picture is similar to the one at high redshifts , how do the simulations account for the apparent correlations between low-@xmath18 absorbers and galaxies , and can they reconcile the somewhat contradictory evidence on absorber - galaxy associations supplied by different observational studies",
    "? we will argue below that the simulations provide a good account of the observed properties of the low-@xmath18 forest , that the answer to the evolution question is fairly simple , and that the answers to the subsequent questions are clear but multi - faceted .",

    "sec : dndz ] we compare @xmath1  and @xmath14   computed from our simulated spectra to the most recent analysis of key project data at low redshift ( @xcite ) and to an analysis of keck hires spectra at high redshift ( @xcite ) . in  [",

    "we employ hydrodynamic simulations of four currently favored variants of the cdm scenario : a lambda - dominated cdm model ( lcdm ) with @xmath31 ( @xcite ) , a tilted cdm model with a slope of @xmath32 on large scales ( tcdm ; @xcite ) , an open cdm model ( ocdm ) with @xmath33 ( @xcite ) , and a cold  + hot dark matter model ( chdm ) with two neutrino species totaling @xmath34 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the properties of the models are listed in table  [ table : models ] ; each is roughly consistent with cobe normalization , cluster normalization , and the baryon density @xmath35 , as determined from recent measurements of the primordial deuterium abundance ( @xcite , b ) and as favored by the estimates of the mean opacity of the ly@xmath0  forest at high redshifts by rauch et al .",
    "( 1997b ) .",
    "the chdm model has a slightly lower @xmath36 than the others .",
    "the simulations were performed using parallel treesph ( dav et al .",
    "1997a ) , a version of treesph ( @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ) implemented on massively parallel supercomputers .",
    "we use @xmath37 dark matter particles and @xmath37 gas particles , with an additional @xmath38 neutrino particles for the chdm model , evolving within a periodic cube of 11.111@xmath39  comoving mpc on a side and a gravitational softening length of 3@xmath39  comoving kpc ( equivalent plummer softening ) .",
    "we include a prescription for converting gas into stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the starting redshift and the mass resolution for the dark matter and gas particles for each model are listed in table  [ table : cosmo ] . for the lcdm , tcdm , and ocdm simulations ,",
    "the initial conditions are random realizations of a gaussian field with the appropriate initial power spectrum ; we use the same fourier phases for each of the three models to minimize the effect of `` cosmic variance '' in a finite volume .",
    "the chdm initial conditions were generated with routines provided by @xcite and thus have different random phases .",
    "particles have individual timesteps according to their physical state ; the total number of smallest timesteps to @xmath3 and the total cpu time required are listed in table  [ table : cosmo ] .",
    "the calculations were run on cray t3es at the san diego and pittsburgh supercomputing centers , typically using 16 processors .    when computing radiative cooling and heating rates , we include the effects of photoionization by a spatially uniform uv background , determining ionic abundances by requiring a balance between creation and destruction rates for each ionic species ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we take the shape and intensity of the uv background spectrum @xmath40 from the calculations of haardt & madau ( 1996 , hereafter @xcite ) , who assume that the uv background comes predominantly from quasar light reprocessed by the clumpy igm . however , we use the results of a new version of this calculation ( kindly provided by piero madau ) , which adopts zheng et al.s ( 1997 ) @xmath41 power law index for the mean intrinsic quasar spectrum instead of the earlier value of @xmath42",
    ". we will still refer to this @xmath40 as the hm spectrum .",
    "while photoionization has little effect on the dynamical evolution of the gas in our simulations , it plays a crucial role in our ly@xmath0  forest calculations because it determines the neutral hydrogen fraction , and hence the ly@xmath0  opacity , in diffuse intergalactic gas .",
    "the parameter that controls the relation between neutral fraction and gas overdensity is the hi photoionization rate @xmath43 , the cross - section weighted integral of @xmath40 . since the overall normalization of @xmath40 is not precisely known from either observation or theory , and since the relation between neutral fraction and overdensity also depends on the uncertain parameters @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , we follow the now - standard approach of renormalizing @xmath40 by a constant factor chosen so that artificial spectra from the simulation reproduce the observed value of the mean ly@xmath0  flux decrement ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for each model",
    ", we choose this renormalization factor in order to match the mean decrement @xmath47 measured by rauch et al .",
    "( 1997b ) at @xmath48 .",
    "we apply the _ same _ renormalization factor at all redshifts , so the evolution of @xmath43 ( shown in figure  [ fig : matchj ] below ) is precisely that predicted by hm except for this overall multiplicative constant .",
    "the values of the @xmath40 renormalization factors are listed in table  [ table : cosmo ] , and they would not be significantly different if we chose to match the rauch et al .",
    "( 1997b ) results at @xmath12 instead of @xmath48 . in practice ,",
    "we multiply the hi optical depths by the inverse of this factor instead of recalculating spectra with an increased @xmath40 ; the two procedures have the same effect on the highly photoionized gas that produces ly@xmath0  forest absorption at high redshifts . at low redshifts",
    "the procedure should also work , albeit not quite as well owing to a small number of features where collisional ionization can not be ignored .",
    "we extract artificial ly@xmath0  absorption spectra from the simulations using the tipsy package ( @xcite ; see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we generate 400 spectra along randomly selected lines of sight ( los ) through the simulation volume at output redshifts of @xmath49 and 0 .",
    "we sample the spectra with resolution @xmath50 , roughly corresponding to that of hires .",
    "we `` fit a continuum '' to each small spectral segment ( equal in length to the size of the simulation box ) by rescaling all flux values so that the highest flux pixel has transmission of unity  specifically , we multiply the flux values in all pixels by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the optical depth of the highest flux pixel in the segment .",
    "this procedure removes @xmath53% of the flux at @xmath54 ( depending somewhat on cosmology ) , but for @xmath55 the amount of flux removed is negligible .",
    "after rescaling the continuum , we add gaussian random noise corresponding to a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath56 . varying @xmath57 over a reasonable range , e.g. , between 20 and 50",

    "in the future , we will construct artificial spectra more closely matched to the properties of low-@xmath18 data ; for our current purposes , the level of similarity here is sufficient .",

    ". the same lines of sight are shown at each redshift , so to some extent individual features can be compared from one spectrum to another , though absorbing structures may move into or out of the line of sight over time . the most dramatic evolutionary effect is the paucity of absorption features at low redshift as compared to high redshift",
    ". the change would be smaller if we plotted the same wavelength interval instead of the same comoving distance in each panel , but one can also see that individual features generally become weaker with time and that the mean flux decrement drops sharply between @xmath48 and @xmath59 .",
    "we will discuss the cause of these changes and the significance of the bottom panel with the dashed and dotted lines in  [ sec : ewanal ] .",
    "we fit voigt profiles to each spectrum using the automated voigt profile fitter autovp ( @xcite ) , yielding a column density , a @xmath60-parameter ( i.e. , a gaussian width of the optical depth profile ) , and a rest equivalent width for each line .",
    "ly@xmath0  absorbers are typically fully resolved at all redshifts in our artificial spectra , in contrast to currently available hst spectra .",
    "this represents a systematic difference that may affect the comparison of models to data at low redshift , although for most of the statistics we consider it is unlikely to dominate over other uncertainties .",

    "the dimmest red level in the plot corresponds to a column density of @xmath62 , which in turn corresponds to a line - center optical depth @xmath63 for a voigt - profile line with a @xmath60-parameter of @xmath64 .",
    "orange corresponds to a column density of @xmath65 and yellow corresponds to @xmath66 .",
    "the saturated , white level corresponds to @xmath67 , about a factor of 10 below the column density of a lyman limit system .",
    "the positions of the compact , saturated dots typically correspond to the positions of galaxies ( clumps of stars and cold , dense gas ) , although the luminous regions of the galaxies ( and the cross - sections for producing damped ly@xmath0  absorption ) would be virtually invisible on the scale of figure  [ fig : color ] .    from inspection of figure",
    "[ fig : color ] , one can anticipate many of the conclusions that we will reach from more detailed analyses below .",
    "there is rapid evolution in the number of absorbers above a given threshold between @xmath48 and @xmath68 , but the evolution is much slower between @xmath68 and @xmath3 . the backbone of the structure traced by ly@xmath0  absorption does not change radically even over the full range @xmath48 to @xmath3 ; the evolution of the forest seems to correspond more to a shifting of contour levels rather than a transformation of the underlying structure .",
    "finally , for any given choice of threshold , there will be a much closer correspondence between absorbing regions and galaxies at low redshift than there is at high redshift .",
    "at high redshift ( @xmath69 ) , @xcite find @xmath70 ( where @xmath71 is defined in equation  [ [ eqn : gamma ] ] ) from hires spectra .",
    "ground - based investigations prior to hires provided a somewhat confusing picture , some showing strong evolution ( @xmath72 ; lu et al .",
    "1991 ) and some showing weak evolution ( @xmath73 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we believe that the @xcite determination is more secure and most directly comparable with simulations , since the hires spectra are less subject to line blending and make it possible to detect ly@xmath0  absorbers down to @xmath74",
    ". however , since the number of quasars currently observed with hires is small , the statistics are poor .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath1  quoted by @xcite is for lines with @xmath75 , while our chosen rest equivalent width limit ( @xmath76 ) corresponds ( for typical @xmath60-parameters ) to @xmath77 ; we have therefore applied a small correction to @xcite s value of @xmath78 based on the overall column density distribution taken from their paper .    for @xmath79 ,",
    "@xcite have published the most complete analysis of evolution in the key project sample , obtaining @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the sample we use for comparison is their uniform detection limit sample of lines with @xmath76  ( including ly@xmath0  systems with associated metal lines ) , although the results from other samples are not markedly different .",
    "@xcite do find a trend of more rapid evolution of stronger lines , an issue we will address in  [ sec : dndw ] below .",
    "the size of our simulation volume introduces significant uncertainties when comparing the models with the data .",
    "by @xmath59 , all our models have nonlinear density fluctuations on the scale of the box length .",
    "hence , the artificial spectra at low-@xmath18 are not necessarily a representative sample for that cosmology , since the large scale power absent in these small volume simulations could have a substantial effect on the density fluctuations at all scales .",
    "we do not yet have the ability to gauge this systematic uncertainty , as to do so would require simulating a larger volume than is currently computationally feasible .",
    "nevertheless , we can examine some general trends that should be valid despite these limitations .",
    "furthermore , we have explicitly minimized the impact of finite volume statistical fluctuations on comparisons among the ocdm , tcdm , and lcdm models by using the same initial phases and lines of sight in each simulation .",
    "the differences between these results should therefore reflect inherent differences among the models ( with the caveat that differences in power on scales larger than the box size could impact smaller scales ) .",
    "another uncertainty arises from the finite resolution of these simulations . as wadsley & bond ( 1997 ) have noted , the number of intermediate density ly@xmath0  forest absorbers ( @xmath82 , or @xmath83 ) at @xmath48 is somewhat sensitive to numerical resolution , since these systems are often associated with virialized `` mini - halos '' ( @xcite ; @xcite ) of small mass and spatial extent . at high redshift , these mini - halos probably contribute no more than half of the total number of absorbers above @xmath84  ( @xcite ) and a much smaller fraction of the number above @xmath85 .",
    "however , as we shall show in  [ sec : colspa ] , a given equivalent width absorber corresponds to higher overdensity gas at lower redshift , meaning that the fractional contribution of mini - halos above @xmath86 will increase at lower redshifts .",
    "if our simulations are unable to resolve these objects , it is possible that we are increasingly underestimating the total number of lines at lower redshifts",
    ". we will eventually conduct higher resolution simulations to examine this possibility in more detail .",
    "recently theuns et al .",
    "( 1998b ) and bryan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have examined the sensitivity of _ high _ redshift ly@xmath0  forest predictions to the numerical resolution of hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "both groups find that the predicted column density distribution is reasonably robust to changes in resolution but that convergence of the @xmath60-parameter distribution requires very high resolution .",
    "in addition to these numerical uncertainties , there are sizeable uncertainties in the uv background spectrum .",
    "we take the evolution of @xmath40 directly from @xcite , who calculated the intensity based solely on the observed quasar population at various epochs .",
    "however , there could be an important contribution to the metagalactic flux from other sources such as starburst galaxies and agns , especially as the quasar population declines .",
    "this does not necessarily imply that @xmath40 will be higher than @xcite predict , since corrections for dust and intervening hi absorption can be large and are uncertain ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the intrinsic spectral energy distribution of quasars , assumed by @xcite to follow a power law with slope @xmath41 , is not well determined , and it could in principle vary with redshift , particularly through a correlation between luminosity and its slope ( @xcite ) . these variations would be directly reflected in the number of hi lines observed .",
    "we consider this issue further in ",
    "[ sec : ewcosmo ] .    in sum",
    ", we expect the simulation predictions of the ly@xmath0  forest to be fairly reliable at high redshift but less so at low redshift , where the effects of the finite simulation volume and finite resolution are more significant , the uv background history is more uncertain , and the noise and resolution properties of our artificial spectra are less closely matched to current observational data ( see  [ sec : sims ] ) .",

    "all of the cosmological models that we consider ( lcdm , ocdm , tcdm , chdm ) give a fairly good match to the observed evolution of @xmath1 ; in particular , all of them predict a transition from rapid evolution to slow evolution at @xmath9 .",
    "the ingredient crucial to this success is the @xcite photoionizing background history , and the primary cause of the break in @xmath1  evolution is the transition from a roughly constant uv background intensity at @xmath5 to a rapidly declining uv background intensity at @xmath97 .",

    "the lines with column densities @xmath244 ( typical of the large key project samples ) arise in gas that is overdense by a factor of 20 or more , and these lines tend to occur close to galaxies . at @xmath48 , gas of this overdensity would produce lines with @xmath245 , approaching the column density of lyman limit systems , which are also closely correlated with the galaxy distribution ( @xcite , figure  2 ) .",

    "the second basic prediction of our scenario is a large coherence scale for low-@xmath18 ly@xmath0  forest absorbers , which can be tested by absorption studies in pairs of quasars with small angular separation . in our simulations ,",
    "most ly@xmath0  forest absorption arises in systems that have low physical densities ( @xmath252 for @xmath253 ) and low neutral fractions .",
    "these systems must have large path lengths in order to build up detectable neutral column densities .",
    "models that invoke denser gas in mini - halos or pressure - confined clouds would typically predict much smaller sizes for individual absorbers .",
    "we reserve detailed predictions for future work , but it is evident from figures  [ fig : color ] and  [ fig : contour ] that absorption with @xmath253 should show substantial coherence across lines of sight separated by as much as several hundred @xmath254 .",
    "initial results for a quasar pair covering the absorption redshift range @xmath255 do indicate a coherence scale of hundreds of @xmath254 , thus providing preliminary support for the scenario advanced here ( @xcite , 1998 ) .    throughout this paper",
    ", we have adopted the conventional description of the ly@xmath0  forest as a collection of `` lines , '' each of which is produced by a distinct `` absorber . '' in several of our recent papers on the high - redshift ly@xmath0  forest , we have argued that it is often more profitable to view a ly@xmath0  forest spectrum as a continuous 1-dimensional map of the smoothly fluctuating igm ( e.g. , @xciteb , 1998 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xciteb ) .",
    "statistical measures that treat the transmitted flux as a continuous 1-dimensional field have two practical advantages : they do not interpose a complicated line - fitting algorithm in the path between theoretical predictions and observational data , and they can make more complete use of the information in an observed spectrum by detecting the collective signature of fluctuations that are too weak to be detected individually . at least at high redshift , the continuous igm view also has the advantage of theoretical simplicity , because the ly@xmath0  optical depth is closely tied to the underlying mass density ( @xcite ) , while the number of ly@xmath0  lines is not .",
    "this theoretical simplicity leads to analytic and numerical approximations that capture many of the basic results of full hydrodynamic simulations ( @xcite ; hui et al .",
    "1997 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and these approximations can be used to obtain analytic lower bounds on the baryon density ( @xcite , 1998b ) , to span a wide range of cosmological parameters with fast numerical simulations ( @xcite ) , to derive the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations ( @xcite ) , and even to invert an observed ly@xmath0  spectrum into a line - of - sight density field ( @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is not clear that the approximations that work well at high redshift will continue to be accurate at low redshift , since the opacity of the ly@xmath0  forest at low redshift is contributed mainly by shocked gas rather than the unshocked gas that dominates the opacity at high redshift .",
    "shock heating introduces scatter into the relation between density and temperature ( see figure  [ fig : nhtemp ] ) , and it therefore loosens the correlation between the ly@xmath0  optical depth and the underlying gas density .",
    "the practical advantages of the continuous field statistics still hold at low redshift , and we suspect that such statistics will be the most powerful tools for testing cosmological models against ly@xmath0  forest data at all redshifts . however , the validity of techniques that have been shown to work at high redshift must be tested anew against hydrodynamic simulations at low redshift , and in many cases the accuracy of these techniques is likely to decline .",
    "we will return to these issues in future work .",
    "there are many other opportunities for comparing these cosmological simulations to data on the low - redshift ly@xmath0  forest , including studies of metal - line absorption to constrain the enrichment and ionization state of different phases of the igm ( as pursued at high redshift by @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the above - mentioned studies of absorption along paired lines of sight ( see @xcite ) , studies of the evolution of lyman limit and damped ly@xmath0  systems ( pursued at high redshift by @xcite ; gardner et al . 1997ab ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , further studies of the relationship between the absorbers and galaxies ( i.e. larger volume analogs of the simulations of @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and studies of x - ray absorption features that can probe higher temperature gas ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the rapid development of computing technology and algorithms offers the prospect of larger volume , higher resolution simulations of the ly@xmath0  forest in the near future .",
    "the comparison of existing and future simulations to the increasingly detailed and sensitive observations of the high- and low - redshift ly@xmath0  forest will fulfill the original promise of quasar absorption line studies , to place firm constraints on cosmological parameters and to provide a comprehensive view of structure formation and evolution from the epoch of primeval galaxy formation to the present .",

    "<S> we study the physical origin of the low - redshift ly@xmath0  forest in hydrodynamic simulations of four cosmological models , all variants of the cold dark matter scenario . </S>",
    "<S> our most important conclusions are insensitive to the cosmological model , but they depend on our assumption that the uv background declines at low redshift in concert with the declining population of quasar sources . we find that the expansion of the universe drives rapid evolution of @xmath1   ( the number of absorbers per unit redshift above a specified equivalent width threshold ) at @xmath2 , but that at lower redshift the fading of the uv background counters the influence of expansion , leading to slow evolution of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the draining of gas from low density regions into collapsed structures has a mild but not negligible effect on the evolution of @xmath1 , especially for high equivalent width thresholds . at every redshift </S>",
    "<S> , weaker lines come primarily from moderate fluctuations of the diffuse , unshocked intergalactic medium ( igm ) , and stronger lines originate in shocked or radiatively cooled gas of higher overdensity . </S>",
    "<S> however , the neutral hydrogen column density associated with structures of fixed overdensity drops as the universe expands , so an absorber at @xmath3 is dynamically analogous to an absorber that has column density 10 to 50 times higher at @xmath4 . in particular , the mildly overdense igm fluctuations that dominate the ly@xmath0  forest opacity at @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> produce optically thin lines at @xmath6 , while the marginally saturated ( @xmath7 ) lines at @xmath6 typically arise in gas that is overdense by a factor of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we find no clear distinction between lines arising in `` galaxy halos '' and lines arising in larger scale structures ; however , galaxies tend to lie near the dense regions of the igm that are responsible for strong ly@xmath0  lines . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations provide a unified physical picture that accounts for the most distinctive observed properties of the low - redshift ly@xmath0  forest : ( 1 ) a sharp transition in the evolution of @xmath1  at @xmath9 , ( 2 ) stronger evolution for absorbers of higher equivalent width , ( 3 ) a correlation of increasing ly@xmath0  equivalent width with decreasing galaxy impact parameter that extends to @xmath10 , and ( 4 ) a tendency for stronger lines to arise in close proximity to galaxies while weaker lines trace more diffuse large scale structure . </S>"
