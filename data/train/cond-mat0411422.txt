    "the discovery of superconductivity in the alkali - metal - doped bulk fullerenes @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite sparked intense interest in fullerene - based materials , leading to extensive experimental and theoretical studies ( for a review see ref . ) .",
    "theoretical calculations to explain the insulating and superconducting properties of bulk fullerene materials fall into two major categories : molecular level calculations which determine the effective interactions of intramolecular electrons,@xcite and lattice level calculations based on an effective hamiltonian in which the intramolecular degrees of freedom have been integrated out.@xcite    although much of the work has focused on the phonon mechanism for superconductivity in the alkali-@xmath0 s , some authors have proposed a purely electronic mechanism . in particular ,",
    "it was argued by chakravarty , kivelson and co - workers ( ck ) that electronic interactions within a single @xmath0 molecule can lead to an effective attraction between charge carriers .",
    "@xcite this argument was supported by perturbative calculations of the electronic binding energies of the conventional one band hubbard model , on the @xmath0 structure .",
    "results of the ck calculation suggest that electrons have a tendency to form paired states in a single fullerene molecule , rather than remain separate",
    ". this tendency could be the origin of the attractive interaction which is an essential ingredient of the bcs theory of superconductivity .",
    "however , one might doubt the applicability of perturbation theory to this problem . first",
    ", the hubbard repulsion @xmath3 in the ck calculation is approximately 75% of the bandwidth , so it is hardly a small parameter .",
    "also , the binding energy is typically a small quantity , calculated from the difference of large internal energies of the @xmath0 molecule at different electron dopings .",
    "low order perturbation theory estimates of such subtle energy differences may be unreliable .",
    "thus it is interesting to repeat the calculation using different methods , which might lend support to or cast doubt upon the perturbation theory results .",
    "c +    in this paper we use quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations to estimate the binding energy of pairs of electrons on a single @xmath0 hubbard molecule . in order to establish a high level of confidence in our results",
    ", we use a number of complementary qmc methods , including auxiliary field qmc for both real and imaginary chemical potentials @xcite and stochastic series expansion ( sse ) at finite temperature @xmath4 , and projector qmc ( pqmc ) at @xmath5 on a series of hubbard molecules , with the number of sites ranging from 4 to 60 .",
    "in addition , comparison is made to the results of exact diagonalization ( ed ) for systems of up to 12 sites .",
    "our main result , shown in figure [ perturb61 ] , is a comparison of the pair binding energy ( see below for a definition ) for two electrons added to a neutral @xmath0 molecule , to the perturbation calculations of ck .",
    "all energies are measured in units of the hopping parameter @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast to perturbation theory , which finds that the ground state is a singlet for @xmath7 , we find , in agreement with hund s rule , that the ground state remains a triplet state over the entire range of @xmath3 studied . in particular",
    ", there is no indication of the attractive singlet ground state which perturbation theory finds for @xmath8 greater than about @xmath9 .",
    "our qmc studies find small positive binding energies for @xmath10 , indicating that two separate molecules , each with one extra electron , have lower energy than one molecule with two extra electrons .",
    "the largest value of @xmath3 we are able to study is @xmath11 , since the sign problem discussed below becomes unmanageable for larger values of @xmath3 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce the model and the qmc methods used in our simulations .",
    "we then proceed to present the tests of qmc codes on smaller molecules ( truncated tetrahedron , etc . ) , where exact analytical or exact diagonalization results are available .",
    "then the results for the @xmath0 molecule are presented and analyzed .",

    "the difficulty of extracting @xmath19 from pqmc is possibly because the ground state with 14 electrons lies in the spin singlet sector ( as confirmed by ed ) , and it is difficult for pqmc to completely project out the nearby spin triplet state ( first excited state ) .",

    "let us first discuss the non - interacting single electron energy levels of a @xmath0 molecule . at half - filling ,",
    "60 electrons move independently in `` @xmath85 '' molecular orbitals formed from the 60 @xmath86 atomic orbitals of the 60 carbon atoms .",
    "an exact diagonalization of the non - interacting hamiltonian gives 60 energy levels , of which the lowest 30 levels are occupied at half filling .",

    "the highest occupied molecular orbitals ( homo ) are 5-fold degenerate .",
    "the detailed energy levels of the neutral @xmath0 molecule are shown in figure [ c60band ] .",
    "the energy gap between homo and lumo is @xmath87 from this exact diagonalization for non - interacting neutral @xmath0 .",
    "we calculate the energy difference @xmath88 of different total @xmath53 values at the same filling as shown in figure [ c60hund ] .",
    "as a severe sign problem occurs for @xmath84 , the statistical errors are too large for a definite discussion of hund s rule .",
    "thus , we mainly discuss results in figure [ c60hund ] ( a)-(c ) . at @xmath89 and 61 , @xmath88 is positive , which can be explained by the non - interacting energy levels in figure [ c60band ] .",
    "for example , for @xmath90 and total spin @xmath91 , we need to flip one electron from spin down to spin up in order to get @xmath92 , which means we need to excite one spin - down electron from the homo band to the lumo band , with an energy cost of @xmath87 .",
    "the same explanation applies to @xmath93 and 61 . at @xmath94 ,",
    "@xmath88 is close to zero which means that the two different values of @xmath53 are part of the same multiplet . for these cases , in agreement with hund s rule , the electrons tend to occupy the degenerate homo or lumo in a way that maximizes the total spin .",
    "note that the small differences in energy for fixed @xmath30 and different @xmath53 within a multiplet must result from small admixtures of excited states .",
    "for example , if the ground state is a triplet , as for @xmath95 , and if the first excited state is a singlet , then the @xmath96 state may contain a small admixture of the excited singlet state , while the @xmath97 state will not .",
    "this will result in the @xmath96 state having a slightly higher energy than the @xmath97 state , providing a measure of the effectiveness of the projection within this multiplet .    at @xmath98 , the positive @xmath88",
    "can again be explained by the single electron picture .",
    "a spin - down electron in the @xmath99 band must flip its spin and be excited to the @xmath100 band , with an energy cost of @xmath101 for the non - interacting hamiltonian .",
    "this is consistent with figure [ c60hund ] for @xmath102 and 66 .    in table",
    "[ c60pqmc]b we calculate the pair binding energy @xmath103 at various dopings . in these calculation , we have used the lowest energy of the different total spin @xmath104 states for a given @xmath30 .",
    "figure [ perturb61 ] shows a comparison between the perturbation calculations of refs . and pqmc calculations .",
    "there is no indication from the pqmc calculations of a bound singlet state for @xmath105 as suggested by perturbation theory , represented by the solid line in figure [ perturb61 ] .",
    "instead , the ground state for 62 electrons is a triplet over the entire range of parameters studied , in agreement with hund s rule .",
    "furthermore , we find that this triplet state is unbound for @xmath10 .",
    "unfortunately , the sign problem precludes us from studying larger values of @xmath3 using pqmc .",
    "we have also checked the energy difference obtained from pqmc with the results from imaginary chemical potential simulations , which shows good agreement and will be presented elsewhere.@xcite",
    "we have performed extensive qmc simulations on a single @xmath0 molecule . the pqmc simulation calculates internal energies at various fillings , and shows that hund s rule is well obeyed . in contradiction to the perturbation theory result , @xcite we find no singlet pair binding ( i.e. , no negative @xmath103 ) for the parameter ranges explored ( @xmath106 , @xmath25 ) .",
