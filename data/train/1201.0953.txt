    "whereas mssbauer spectroscopy can not be used to determine magnetic structures directly , it is a quantitative local probe that can be used to set hard limits on possible structures . as we will show below , the observation of a single , well - split magnetic component allows us to rule out any structure in which the iron sub - lattice is further subdivided into multiple , inequivalent sites , and the scale of the splitting ( @xmath429  t at 10  k ) is consistent with the 3.31  @xmath158 moment derived from neutron scattering @xcite    several conclusions can be reached simply by inspection of the spectrum taken at 10  k ( fig .

    "the spectrum is dominated by a single , well - split , magnetic component .",
    "this confirms that k@xmath20fe@xmath1se@xmath11 is indeed magnetically ordered in the superconducting state ( recall @xmath159  k for this sample ) .",
    "a small quadrupole splitting of 0.33@xmath1600.02  mm / s is present and the linewidth ( full width at half maximum ) is 0.200@xmath1610.007  mm / s , slightly larger than our typical instrumental width of 0.15  mm / s .",

    "finally , two of the lines normally present in a magnetically split @xmath27fe mssbauer spectra , are essentially absent from the 10  k pattern .",
    "a magnetic field at the @xmath27fe nucleus , either externally applied or transferred from an ordered moment on the iron atom , lifts the degeneracy of the nuclear states and , in combination with the selection rules for the @xmath163 transition , leads to a six - line pattern with intensities of 3:r:1:1:r:3 ( counting from left to right in fig .",

    "since the sample consists of an ab - plane mosaic of single crystals , setting @xmath168 means that the magnetic ordering direction is parallel to the _ c_-axis , ruling out any magnetic structures that involve planar ordering of the iron moments .",
    "we note that r is a relatively soft function of @xmath167 near zero , and a free fit to the intensity of the @xmath169 transitions is consistent with an angle of 18@xmath170 , and leads to a slight improvement in the least square fit error , @xmath171 , for the fit",
    ". such an angle would not be consistent with a purely planar ordering of the iron moments ( indeed , if the ordering were planar , then r would be 4 , and the @xmath154 transitions would provide the strongest features in the spectrum ) but it is too large to be dismissed as being due to a simple mis - alignment of the mosaic .",
    "this suggests that there is a small canting of the antiferromagnetic structure away from the _ c_-axis .    estimating the iron moment from the observed hyperfine field requires some care as the scaling is imperfect at best@xcite .",
    "however , some data exist on binary iron  chalcogenides that can be used as a guide ( table  i ) .",

    "this is significantly larger than the 3.31  @xmath22/fe reported on the basis of neutron diffractionweibao , however it does suggest that the iron moment is indeed substantial as even the larger conversion factor for the sulphide yields 3.5  @xmath22/fe .",
    "if we assume that @xmath43 is at least proportional to the iron moment , then we can use the observed change in @xmath43 between 10  k and 293  k to scale the 3.31  @xmath22/fe observed at 11  k@xcite to get an estimate of 3.0  @xmath22/fe for the moment at room temperature for comparison with the much smaller value of 2.55  @xmath22/fe reported by pomjakushin _ _ et al ..",

    "the data presented so far offer a rather contradictory set of observations . on one hand k@xmath20fe@xmath1se@xmath2 appears to have a high value of @xmath62 , a fair - sized shielding fraction , and @xmath38 anisotropy that is consistent with many of the other fe - based superconductors . on the other hand ,",
    "the electrical resistivity of k@xmath20fe@xmath1se@xmath2 is anomalously high , with increasingly non - metallic temperature dependence depending on precise fe stoichiometry , the specific heat jump , @xmath188 is relatively small , and there is large , local moment - like antiferromagnetic order of the fe sublattice with a first order transition near 530 k. if the sample were to be considered homogeneous , with all of these features being associated with the same , single phase , then we would need to consider k@xmath20fe@xmath1se@xmath2 to be an anomalous and very different type of fe - based superconductivity .",
    "as it stands , though , there are several indications , in the data presented , that k@xmath20fe@xmath1se@xmath2 is not homogeneous , but rather is phase separated into a non - magnetically ordered , minority phase that is superconducting and a majority phase that manifest high temperature , large moment , antiferromagnetic order and is probably near insulating .",
    "the mssbauer and electron microscopy data shown in figures 1.12 - 1.15 indicate that there may well be a mesoscopic phase separation into a majority phase with a large hyperfine field on the fe site and a minority phase with essentially no hyperfine field on the fe site .",
    "this , combined with the reduced jump in @xmath88 and the apparently high electrical resistivity , point toward a scaffold - like network ( or aerogel - like pattern ) of conducting ( and below 30 k , superconducting ) phase that exists on a sub - micron length scale .",
    "such a network would be consistent with the moderate shielding seen in the zfc low field magnetization data as well as the magneto optical results .",
    "such a phase separated , minority , superconducting phase would allow the majority phase to host the large moment antiferromagnetism and also be a poor conductor , explaining the curious composite resistivity data that is so sensitive on fe stoichiometry . it is important to note , though , that given the clear anisotropy in @xmath106 data , this minority phase has to remain , at least partially , oriented with the host matrix . given the similarity in @xmath38 anisotropy between k@xmath20fe@xmath1se@xmath2 and other fe - based superconductors , it is tempting to assume that the orientation of the minority phase is closer to complete than to random , but this will need to be tested directly . after our initial reports of phase separationryan2011 , the phase separation scenario in k@xmath17fe@xmath18se@xmath2 is proposed by more and more recent reports , from transmission electron microscopy@xcite,@xcite , single - crystal xrd@xcite and magnetic hysteresis loops.@xcite",

    "the upper critical field of k@xmath20fe@xmath1se@xmath2 is determined as @xmath129(18 k ) @xmath67 54 t and @xmath123(1.6 k ) @xmath94 56 t. the anisotropy parameter @xmath133 initially increases with decreasing temperature , passed through a maximum of @xmath192 near 27 k , then decreases to @xmath193 at 18 k. the observed @xmath133 values show a weakening anisotropic effect at low temperatures .",
    "although the fe - based superconductors have a layered crystal structure , a weak anisotropy of @xmath3 may be a common feature , suggesting that the inter - layer coupling and the three dimensional fermi surface may play an important role in the superconductivity of this family .",
    "our @xmath27fe mssbauer spectroscopy study confirms the presence of magnetic order from well below @xmath159  k to @xmath7  k. the large magnetic splitting of 29.4@xmath1600.1  t at 10  k indicates that the iron moments are large , consistent with values of 3.3  @xmath22/fe observed by neutron diffraction at 11  k@xcite , while the line intensities indicate that the ordering is almost parallel to the _ c_-axis .",
    "an apparent paramagnetic impurity phase can be attributed to iron atoms in the 4@xmath178 site or the stoichiometry variation of the microstructure seen in bes image .",
    "analysis of the spectra taken in the vicinity of @xmath23 shows that the magnetic fraction decreases rapidly above 500  k and that the loss of order is driven by a first order structural transition .",
    "in addition to the above , conspicuous observations , there is growing evidence that k@xmath20fe@xmath1se@xmath2 is a phase separated sample , with a metallic ( and at low temperature , superconducting ) minority phase that does not manifest long range magnetic order and a majority phase that undergoes a first order , antiferromagnetic phase transition near 530 k and may well be either non - conducting or very poorly conducting .",
    "as such , k@xmath189fe@xmath1se@xmath2 would essentially be a superconducting aerogel embedded in a matrix of antiferromagnetic ( near ) insulator .",
