    "the dispersion of particles poses extraordinary challenges when the complexity of the flow geometry or the large reynolds numbers requires the use of turbulence models .",
    "in particular , the modelisation of the small eulerian scales can significantly alter the dynamics of particle dispersion .",
    "particle dispersion in turbulence , either from extended or from localized sources @xcite , is a very common phenomenon of practical importance for atmospheric as well as for many applied problems @xcite . among the many possible examples , we remind here the dynamics and the spatial distribution of pollutants and pollen in the atmosphere @xcite or oceanic flows @xcite , the formation and the dynamics of small rain droplets in clouds @xcite , the dynamics of colloidal aggregates in turbulence @xcite , the combustion of fuel droplets and the formation of soot particles in engines @xcite .",
    "the development of turbulence models and closures , to describe the effect of the _ unresolved _ or sub - grid scale ( sgs ) features of the eulerian vector or scalar fields , has a long history dating back to lilly and smagorinsky ( see @xcite ) .",

    "+ the development of sub - grid models for lagrangian turbulence has a relatively shorter history , partly due to the lack of accurate experimental and direct - numerical simulation measurements of lagrangian statistics in high - reynolds number flows .",
    "the recent availability of a large amount of lagrangian statistics measurements in hit @xcite has allowed to quantitatively establish the phenomenological picture for tracers ( reviewed in @xcite ) , and partially also for inertial point - particles @xcite .",
    "the knowledge borrowed from experiments and direct numerical simulations has then promoted new research on lagrangian sub - grid scale models for tracers , and inertial particles also ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the effects of small - scale temporal and spatial correlations on the dynamics of particles are an important problem @xcite .",
    "in particular beyond _ classical _ measurements of the lagrangian dynamics of a single particle and of particle pairs , the geometric features of multiparticles dispersion has also been investigated @xcite .",
    "+ within the complex picture of lagrangian dynamics , one of the most important point is that lagrangian turbulence is more intermittent than eulerian turbulence @xcite and , as a result , one may have to pay additional care when using gaussian models to model the lagrangian velocity fields .",
    "moreover , in hit , the relative dispersion of tracers is mainly dominated by small - scale fluid motions : if these are neglected , particle pairs disperse at a much slower rate than the actual one ( ballistic vs richardson dispersion ) .",

    "the literature on the topic is vast and we can not review it here .",

    "an essential prescription for the model is the capability to correctly reproduce single - particle absolute diffusion together with multi - particle dispersion . for the latter ,",
    "we require proper reproduction of inertial range pair dispersion ( richardson dispersion @xcite ) , as well as dynamics and deformation of tetrads .",
