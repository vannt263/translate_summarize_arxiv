    "recently , the magnetic ordering induced by external field or impurity ions in spin gap systems attracted much interest and thus led to a large number of vivid experimental and theoretical investigations . when a strong magnetic field , which is higher than the gap field @xmath12 corresponding to the energy gap @xmath13 , is applied in a spin gap system , the energy gap vanishes , and the system can undergo the field - induced magnetic ordering with the help of the three - dimensional interactions .",
    "such field - induced magnetic ordering was observed in many spin gap systems , cu@xmath14(c@xmath15h@xmath16n@xmath14)@xmath14cl@xmath17 @xcite , ni(c@xmath15h@xmath18n@xmath14)@xmath14n@xmath2(clo@xmath17 ) @xcite , ni(c@xmath15h@xmath18n@xmath14)@xmath14n@xmath2(pf@xmath19 ) @xcite , cu(no@xmath2)@xmath14@xmath202.5h@xmath14o @xcite , ( ch@xmath2)@xmath14chnh@xmath2cucl@xmath2 @xcite , ( c@xmath17h@xmath16n@xmath14)cu@xmath14cl@xmath19 @xcite and kcucl@xmath2 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "when nonmagnetic ions are substituted for magnetic ions in a spin gap system , the singlet ground state is disturbed so that staggered moments are induced around the impurities .",
    "if the induced moments interact through effective exchange interactions , which are mediated by intermediate singlet spins , three - dimensional ( 3d ) long - range order can arise .",
    "such impurity - induced antiferromagnetic ordering was also observed in some spin gap systems , ( cu@xmath0zn@xmath1)geo@xmath2 @xcite , ( cu@xmath0mg@xmath1)geo@xmath2 @xcite , sr(cu@xmath0zn@xmath1)@xmath14o@xmath2 @xcite and pb(ni@xmath0mg@xmath1)@xmath14v@xmath14o@xmath21 @xcite .",

    "this paper is concerned with the impurity - induced antiferromagnetic ordering in the mg - doped spin gap system tl(cu@xmath0mg@xmath1)cl@xmath2 where the parent compound tlcucl@xmath2 is known to undergo the field - induced magnetic ordering and has been extensively studied by author s group .",
    "the parent compound tlcucl@xmath2 has the monoclinic structure ( space group @xmath23 ) @xcite .",
    "the crystal structure is composed of planar dimers of cu@xmath14cl@xmath19 , in which cu@xmath24 ions have spin-@xmath25 .",
    "the dimers are stacked on top of one another to form infinite double chains parallel to the crystallographic @xmath26-axis .",
    "these double chains are located at the corners and center of the unit cell in the @xmath27 plane , and are separated by tl@xmath28 ions .",

    ", it was found that the origin of the spin gap in tlcucl@xmath2 is the strong antiferromagnetic interaction in the chemical dimer cu@xmath14cl@xmath19 , and that the neighboring dimers couple via the strong three - dimensional interdimer interactions along the double chain and in the @xmath30 plane , in which the hole orbitals of cu@xmath24 spread @xcite . using the cluster series expansion ,",
    "the intradimer and the important individual interdimer exchange interactions were obtained @xcite .",
    "the notation of the exchange interactions is given in fig .",
    "[ spinstructure ] .",
    "the main intradimer interaction is denoted as @xmath31 , and then the exchange interaction per bond between spins in dimers separated by a lattice vector @xmath32 is denoted as the exchange energy @xmath33 for pairs of spins at equivalent positions in their respective dimer and as @xmath34 for spins at inequivalent positions .",
    "the field - induced magnetic ordering , as mentioned above , was observed in tlcucl@xmath2 @xcite . in the ordering of tlcucl@xmath2 , two remarkable features have been found .",
    "one of them is that the magnetization has the cusplike minimum at the transition temperature @xmath11 .",
    "another is that the phase boundary between the paramagnetic phase and the ordered phase can be described by the power law .",
    "these features can not be explained by the mean - field approach from the real space @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite suggested that the field - induced magnetic ordering in tlcucl@xmath35 can be represented as a bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of excited triplets ( magnons ) , and then the above two features were qualitatively well described by the magnon bec theory based on the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation .",
    "if the magnons undergo bec at ordering vector @xmath36 for @xmath37 , then the transverse spin components have long - range order , which is characterized by the same wave vector @xmath36 .",
    "the transverse magnetic ordering predicted by the theory @xcite was confirmed by the neutron elastic scattering experiments in magnetic fields @xcite .",

    "spins are arranged in parallel along a leg in the double chain , and make an angle of @xmath39 with the @xmath26-axis .",
    "the spins on the same legs in the double chains located at the corner and the center of the unit cell in the @xmath27 plane are antiparallel .",
    "this structure is consistent with the sign of the intradimer and the individual interdimer exchange interactions obtained by the neutron inelastic scattering measurements @xcite . comparing to the magnetic bragg intensities ,",
    "the angle @xmath39 was estimated as 39@xmath40 .",
    "more recently , we performed the magnetization measurements in the title compound tl(cu@xmath0mg@xmath1)cl@xmath2 , and observed the impurity - induced antiferromagnetic ordering , as mentioned above @xcite .",
    "it was also confirmed that the easy - axis of the magnetic moments lies in the @xmath41 plane at an angle of @xmath42 to the @xmath26-axis .",
    "the easy - axis ( @xmath39=38@xmath40 ) is almost the same as the spin direction ( @xmath39=39@xmath40 ) in the field - induced ordered phase for the parent compound tlcucl@xmath2 .",
    "experimental studies of impurity - induced antiferromagnetic ordering have been performed only on quasi-1d systems to date .",
    "therefore , for comprehensive understanding of impurity - induced antiferromagnetic ordering , it may be necessary to study the ordering on 3d spin gap systems .",
    "also , it is interesting to investigate the relation between the field - induced magnetic ordering and the impurity - induced antiferromagnetic ordering because there is no system so far studied that undergoes both of the orderings except tlcucl@xmath2 to our best knowledge . with these motivations",
    ", we performed the neutron elastic and inelastic scattering measurements in tl(cu@xmath43mg@xmath44)cl@xmath2 in order to investigate the spin structure and the magnetic excitations in the impurity - induced antiferromagnetic ordered phase of tl(cu@xmath0mg@xmath1)cl@xmath2 .",

    "the constant-@xmath47 mode was taken with a fixed final neutron energy @xmath48 of 14.7 mev and collimations were set as open-80-80-80 on jaeri - tas1 . in order to investigate the low energy excitation with the higher energy resolution , the inelastic scattering , in which the constant-@xmath47 mode was taken with a fixed final neutron energy @xmath48 of 5.0 mev and collimations",
    "were set as 24-80-80-80 , were also carried out on jaeri - ltas .",
    "a pyrolytic graphite filter was placed to suppress the higher order contaminations .",
    "we used a sample with a volume of approximately 1 @xmath49 .",
    "the sample was mounted in an ill - type orange cryostat with its @xmath9- and @xmath10-axes in the scattering plane .",
    "the crystallographic parameters were determined as @xmath50 1/@xmath51 , @xmath52 1/@xmath51 and @xmath53 at helium temperatures .",
    "the inset of fig . [ q10 - 3profile ] shows the @xmath54 scans for @xmath55 reflection measured at @xmath56 and 4.2 k in tl(cu@xmath43mg@xmath44)cl@xmath2 .",
    "figure [ q10 - 3profile ] depicts the intensity difference @xmath57k@xmath58k@xmath59 of these scans .",
    "a resolution limited additional intensity at low temperature can be clearly seen .",
    "figure [ q10 - 3temdep ] shows the temperature dependence of the peak intensity at @xmath55 .",
    "the rapid increase of the intensity below @xmath7 k is observed .",
    "this transition temperature is in agreement with the phase diagram of this doped sample obtained from the magnetization measurements @xcite .",
    "we thus infer that the additional intensity at low @xmath60 is of magnetic origin .",
    "these magnetic intensities at low temperature are observed at @xmath61 for integer @xmath5 and odd @xmath6 in the doped sample .",
    "these reciprocal points are the same as those , at which the magnetic bragg peaks indicative of the field - induced transverse nel ordering were observed in tlcucl@xmath2 . in order to determine the spin structure of the impurity - induced antiferromagnetic ordered phase in tl(cu@xmath43mg@xmath44)cl@xmath2 , we measured the integrated intensities of nine bragg reflections at @xmath56 and 4.2 k. the integrated intensities of the magnetic bragg reflections were obtained by fitting the difference of the observed intensities at @xmath56 and 4.2 k using a gaussian function , as shown in fig .",
    "[ q10 - 3profile ] .",
    "the results are summalized in table [ table2 ] .",
    "the magnetic bragg reflections are resolution limited ( _ e.g. _ see fig .",
    "[ q10 - 3profile ] ) and correspond to a correlation length greater than 150 @xmath62 .",
    "this indicates that the ordering is of a long range nature .",
    "the intensities of nuclear bragg reflections were also measured at @xmath4 with even @xmath6 in order to estimate the magnitude of the effective magnetic moment averaged per site . because the parent compound tlcucl@xmath2 belongs to the space group @xmath23 , nuclear peaks are expected only at @xmath4 with even @xmath6 . however , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ q10 - 3profile ] , the nuclear peaks , though weak , were observed also for odd @xmath6 at @xmath63 k. in the pure tlcucl@xmath2 , very weak nuclear peaks have been observed for odd @xmath6 @xcite which may be attributed to the impurity induced small distortion lowering the local symmetry .",
    "the intensities of the odd @xmath6 nuclear peaks observed in the doped compound tl(cu@xmath43mg@xmath44)cl@xmath2 was larger than those observed in the pure tlcucl@xmath2 , but still smaller than the allowed even @xmath6 peaks in tl(cu@xmath43mg@xmath44)cl@xmath2 .",
    "we checked that the allowed nuclear bragg intensities in the present measurements are consistent with the nuclear structure factor evaluated from the crystal structure of tlcucl@xmath2 for the weak reflection , in which the extinction effect is almost ineffective .",
    "as shown in reference @xcite , it is also confirmed that the magnetic susceptibilities of this doped sample behave the same as tlcucl@xmath2 above @xmath64 k , indicating the absence of any structural phase transition .",
    "we therefore infer that the nuclear peaks observed at odd @xmath6 are due to the local disturbance of lattice caused by the mg doping .",
    "one possible reason for such a local disturbance could be caused , for instance , by the difference between the jahn - teller ( jt ) distorted cucl@xmath19 octahedra and non jt active ion containing mgcl@xmath19 octahedra , so that the extinction law for odd @xmath6 could be locally broken .",
    "although more detailed informations of the observed reflections at odd @xmath6 can be obtained by powder diffraction measurements at low temperature , we believe that the magnetic results presented here will be not affected . to refine the magnetic structure , we therefore used the atomic coordinates of tlcucl@xmath2 @xcite and the nuclear scattering lengths @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the unit of 10@xmath68 cm @xcite .",
    "the magnetic form factors of cu@xmath24 were taken from reference @xcite .",
    "the extinction effect was evaluated by comparing observed and calculated intensities for various nuclear bragg reflections .    because the magnetic bragg reflections were observed at @xmath4 with integer @xmath5 and odd @xmath6 , the antiferromagnetic ordering as shown in fig .",
    "[ spinstructure ] is expected . as mentioned in introduction ,",
    "it is suggested that the spin lies in the @xmath38 plane from the magnetization measurements @xcite .",
    "hence the free parameters in this calculation are only @xmath39 and @xmath69 , which are the angle between the spins and the @xmath26-axis , and the scale factor , respectively .",
    "the calculated intensities of the best fit with @xmath70 are indicated in table [ table2 ] and the overall agreement can be considered as being satisfactory .",
    "the obtained angle @xmath39 is consistent with the magnetization measurements of tl(cu@xmath0mg@xmath1)cl@xmath2 , and is , with in error bars , the same as that in the spin structure of the field - induced ordered phase of tlcucl@xmath2 for @xmath8 .",
    "hence we conclude that the spin structure of the impurity - induced antiferromagnetic ordered phase on average in tl(cu@xmath43mg@xmath44)cl@xmath2 is the same as that of the field - induced magnetic ordered phase for @xmath8 in the parent compound tlcucl@xmath2 ( `` on average '' means that the magnitude of the ordered moments in the impurity - induced antiferromagnetic ordered phase may be not uniform . ) .    comparing magnetic peak intensities with those of nuclear reflections , the magnitude of the effective magnetic moment averaged per site at @xmath56 k",

    "the obtained scan profiles in tl(cu@xmath43mg@xmath44)cl@xmath2 were almost the same as those obtained in the parent compound tlcucl@xmath2 @xcite , and we confirmed that the origin of the observed excitation is magnetic from the temperature dependence .",
    "hence we can expect that the observed excitation is the triplet magnetic excitation in the impurity - induced ordered state .",
    "the dispersion relation @xmath84 of the excitation obtained for the @xmath85 scattering plane at @xmath82 k is summarized in fig .",

    "based on the present results , it is evident that the periodicity of the triplet excitation in tl(cu@xmath43mg@xmath44)cl@xmath2 is the same as that of the nuclear reciprocal lattice along the @xmath9-axis , but doubled along the @xmath10-axis , as observed in tlcucl@xmath2 @xcite .",

    "a well - defined single excitation was also observed at all temperatures .",
    "hence it is confirmed that the spin gap remains even in the impurity - induced ordered phase . because the excitation was also observed at @xmath88 k , which is higher than @xmath11 , the excitation is not spin - wave excitation by the antiferromagnetic ordering , but the triplet excitation from the ground state . the horizontal bars in fig .",
    "[ 001count ] denote the calculated instrumental resolution widths .",

    "the shape of the dispersion relation in the vicinity of @xmath75=(0 , 0 , 1 ) was fixed to that obtained from the rpa approximation ( see below ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the energy of the triplet excitation at @xmath86 is shown in fig .",
    "[ 001temdep ] .",
    "the rapid increase of the excitation energy can be clearly seen below @xmath7 k. the triplet excitation depends on temperature due to the temperature dependence of the occupation difference between the singlet and triplet states @xcite .",
    "however , the increase of temperature causes to flatten the dispersion relation due to the suppression of the interdimer correlations by the decrease of the occupation difference , namely the energy of the lowest excitation corresponding to the spin gap should rather decrease upon decreasing temperature .",
    "hence , we can expect that the rapid increase of the spin gap is caused by the impurity - induced antiferromagnetic ordering and can conclude that the impurity - induced antiferromagnetic ordering coexists with the spin gap in tl(cu@xmath43mg@xmath44)cl@xmath2 .",
    "the energy of the lowest excitation is @xmath92 mev at @xmath88 k , which is higher than @xmath11 , and is a little larger than that of 0.65 @xmath93 0.8 mev estimated for the pure tlcucl@xmath2 @xcite .",
