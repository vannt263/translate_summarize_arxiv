    "in statistical mechanics the study of systems that are far from equilibrium continues to attract considerable attention both in the physics and in the mathematics literature . as it turns out",
    ", exclusion processes first introduced by spitzer @xcite and their generalisations provide an excellent set of models that display rich and interesting nonequilibrium phenomena .",
    "moreover , these processes are intimately related to a number of different models from statistical mechanics , combinatorics , probability and random matrix theory and a fruitful interplay between these fields , triggered by the seminal work of baik , deift and johansson @xcite , continues to produce spectacular results that yield very precise information on the behavior of such systems .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this article to explain all or even a fair amount of these results in detail .",
    "instead , we remain faithful to the original goal of the set of lectures on which this manuscript is based , namely to explain the fascinating developments in this field to an audience of scientists working in many different areas of mathematics and theoretical physics .",
    "we do not assume any significant acquaintance with the concepts of statistical mechanics or probability theory . in order to keep our presentation as elementary as possible",
    "we shall always focus on the simplest cases .",
    "readers who wish to obtain more information on a specific topic will be referred to the literature . here",
    "we will make use of the numerous reviews that have appeared recently in this area .    in the remaining part of the introduction we provide a short outline of the topics that will be treated in this paper .    in sect .",
    "[ equilibrium ] we begin our discussion by explaining in general terms what physicists mean by the distinction between equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems , and by describing different types of nonequilibrium behavior .",
    "we then introduce in sect .",
    "[ exclusion ] a class of stochastic models , known as _ simple exclusion processes_. they describe the stochastic motion of interacting particles on a lattice where the interaction is given by the exclusion property , i.e. two particles may not occupy the same site simultaneously .",
    "interacting particle systems provide useful models for various nonequilibrium phenomena .",
    "technically , they are ( discrete or continuous time ) markov chains , and we will argue below in sect .",
    "[ markov ] that a simple yet precise criterion for the equilibrium vs. nonequilibrium character of a given system can be formulated within the general theory of markov chains @xcite .",
    "we then proceed to explain in more detail how one dimensional simple exclusion processes can be analyzed , specializing to the case where particles move only to neighboring lattice sites . if the probabilities to move right or left differ from each other one obtains the _ asymmetric simple exclusion process _ ( asep ) .",
    "mostly this paper will be concerned with asep and its subcase tasep ( _ totally asymmetric simple exclusion process _ ) where all motion is unidirectional .",
    "the criterion of sect .",
    "[ markov ] identifies asep ( and consequently tasep ) as nonequilibrium systems .",
    "in fact , asep has become a paradigmatic model for driven transport of a single conserved quantity and most of our discussion is focused on this class of models . for readers who are not familiar with asep and tasep it might be useful at this point to have a look at the precise definition in sect .",
    "[ jsec3.1 ] .",
    "we begin our exposition of the analysis of asep with a discussion of stationary measures in sect .",
    "[ measures ] where it is explained why the uniform distribution always provides a stationary measure in the simplest case of periodic boundary conditions .    for a macroscopic description of the dynamics",
    "the notion of the hydrodynamic limit is introduced .",
    "the time evolution of the macroscopic particle density is then described by a hyperbolic pde that can be solved by the method of characteristics ( sect .",
    "[ hydro ] ) .",
    "after this has been established it is most natural to ask how much the process fluctuates around this macroscopic description . at this point",
    "it is useful to realize that asep is equivalent to a specific random model for surface growth which is known as corner growth or single step model ( sect .",
    "[ growthmodel ] ) .",
    "kardar , parisi and zhang ( kpz ) conjectured in their seminal paper @xcite that the fluctuation properties of a large class of ( growth ) models are universal . assuming that kpz universality can be applied to this particular growth model , one may obtain predictions for the scaling exponents of the fluctuations of the height of the surface and of the scaling exponent of the ( spatial ) correlation length . the kpz conjecture and its implications for asep will be explained in sect .",
    "[ kpz_conjecture ] .",
    "the kpz conjecture is based on the kpz equation which essentially adds stochastic driving to the hyperbolic pde that describes the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "unfortunately , the kpz equation is difficult to analyze and it was only very recently that fluctuation results for solutions of the kpz equation became available ( cf .",
    "[ t8.4 ] ) . before that an alternative approach to studying fluctuation properties",
    "was taken that turned out to be very fruitful .",
    "rather than dealing with the kpz equation itself one analyzes various specific models that are believed to belong to the kpz universality class .",
    "a major breakthrough was achieved through a spectacular discovery on ulam s problem for random permutations .    in the early 60 s ulam raised the question to determine the asymptotics of the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a random permutation of the numbers @xmath0 , where it is assumed that all @xmath1 permutations are equally likely .",
    "it took about 15 years to prove that the expected value of the length of the longest increasing subsequence behaves like @xmath2 as @xmath3 becomes large and there was strong numerical evidence that the fluctuations around the mean are of order @xmath4 . in a remarkable paper baik , deift , and",
    "johansson @xcite did not only prove that @xmath4 was indeed the correct scaling , but they also identified the limiting distribution for the appropriately rescaled fluctuations .",
    "it came as a surprise that the limiting distribution coincides with the tracy - widom distribution that describes the fluctuations of the largest eigenvalue of matrices from the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) as the matrix size tends to infinity .",
    "the article @xcite became the starting signal for an explosion of research activities that continue until today .",
    "it became immediately clear that there is a variety of related combinatorial models ( e.g. growth models , last passage percolation models , tilings , directed polymers in a random environment , tandem queues ) that can be analyzed at the same level of detail and where random matrix distributions appear in the asymptotic description . for further information",
    "we refer the reader to the surveys @xcite and the monograph @xcite .",
    "two results that are of particular relevance for our discussion of kpz universality were obtained independently by prhofer and spohn @xcite and johansson @xcite .",
    "prhofer and spohn used the results in @xcite , and further developments in @xcite , to describe the height fluctuations of the polynuclear growth model ( which is somewhat different from the corner growth/ single step model mentioned above , cf .",
    "[ universality ] ) .",
    "they obtained the scaling law predicted by kpz universality .",
    "moreover , they were able to identify the limiting distributions of the fluctuations .",
    "again these are given by the tracy - widom distributions of random matrix theory .",
    "a distinction needs to be made depending on the curvature of the surface .",
    "flat surfaces lead to statistics from the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , whereas the height - fluctuations of curved surfaces are described by gue statistics .    on the other hand",
    ", the results that johansson presented in @xcite immediately apply to the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with step initial condition .",
    "one obtains the scaling exponent and the limiting distribution for the fluctuations of the particle flux , that are again given by the gue tracy - widom distribution .",
    "we devote sects .",
    "[ tsec : r ]  [ tsec : a ] to explain @xcite in great detail .",
    "this part of our presentation can be viewed as an expanded and more self - contained version of sects .  3 and 4 of the review @xcite by t. sasamoto .",
    "according to the philosophy of our paper we explain the results of johansson in the simplest case .",
    "more precisely , we consider the particle flux at the origin for a discrete time version of tasep ( dtasep , cf . sect .",
    "[ jsec3.1 ] ( iii ) ) with step initial data . in sect .",
    "[ tsec : r ] we formulate johansson s result in theorem [ tsatz : r.1 ] and discuss its relation to kpz universality .",
    "the proof of theorem [ tsatz : r.1 ] naturally falls into two parts .",
    "the first part is of combinatorial nature . via a representation by waiting times ( sect .",
    "[ tsec : c.1 ] ) the problem is mapped to finding the longest subsequence in a list of alphabetically ordered two - letter random words that is weakly increasing in the second letter ( sect .",
    "[ tsec : c.2 ] ) . by the robinson - schensted - knuth algorithm ( sect .",
    "[ tsec : c.3 ] ) one may represent the random words by pairs of semi standard young tableaux of the same shape ( see definition [ tdef : c.1 ] ) .",
    "the advantage of this representation is twofold : on the one hand the length of the longest weakly increasing subsequence is simply given by the length of the first row of the corresponding young tableau .",
    "on the other hand there exist explicit formulae for counting the number of semistandard young tableaux of a given shape , that can be derived using schur polynomials ( sect .",
    "[ tsec : c.4 ] ) .",
    "the result of all this reasoning is formula ( [ teq : c.28 ] ) , where @xmath5 denotes the vandermonde determinant ( see also ( [ teq : r.9 ] ) and definitions [ tdef : r.1 ] and [ tdef : r.2 ] ) .",
    "the second part of the proof of theorem [ tsatz : r.1 ] is the asymptotic analysis of ( [ teq : c.28 ] ) .",
    "the key observation is that the right hand side of ( [ teq : c.28 ] ) has exactly the same structure as the formula for the distribution of the largest eigenvalue of gue matrices .",
    "in particular the method of orthogonal polynomials ( sect .",
    "[ tsec : a.1 ] ) can be applied to complete the proof of theorem [ tsatz : r.1 ] in sect .",
    "[ tsec : a.2 ] .",
    "the somewhat miraculous appearance of the tracy - widom distribution for the fluctuation of the particle flux of dtasep is now explained on a technical level by the fact that hermite polynomials ( used for gue ) and meixner polynomials ( used for dtasep ) look the same near their respective largest zeros after appropriate rescaling .",
    "the similarity of hermite and meixner polynomials is no coincidence .",
    "we briefly discuss the universal behavior of orthogonal polynomials in sect .",
    "[ tsec : a.3 ] .",
    "as it was mentioned above the work of johansson @xcite and of prhofer and spohn @xcite mark the beginning of a broad stream of research activities that continues to produce new and exciting results at a rapid pace . in sect .",
    "[ universality ] we briefly sketch and summarize those directions of recent research that are closely related to the question of kpz - universality . the first generalization beyond @xcite that we describe concerns the initial conditions .",
    "the results of johansson apply for step initial conditions where every site to the left of the origin is occupied whereas every site to the right is empty . based on their work on the polynuclear growth model prhofer and spohn",
    "@xcite formulated a conjecture for the fluctuations of the flux for tasep in the case of a general initial step profile with arbitrary constant particle densities @xmath6 and @xmath7 to the left resp .",
    "right of the origin . in sect .",
    "[ t8.1 ] we explain this conjecture that has recently been fully established by ben arous and corwin @xcite .",
    "most remarkably , in a series of papers @xcite-@xcite c. tracy and h. widom were able to extend some of these results to general asep .",
    "it should be pointed out that their proof is based on the bethe ansatz and does not use any of the nice but very special combinatorial identities that were crucial in the argument of johansson .",
    "furthermore we provide in sect .",
    "[ universality ] pointers to the recent literature regarding spatio - temporal correlations for ( t)asep ( sect .",
    "[ t8.2 ] ) , interacting particle systems beyond ( t)asep ( sect .",
    "[ t8.3 ] ) , fluctuation results for the kpz equation ( sect .",
    "[ t8.4 ] ) , and physical experiments where kpz behavior can be observed ( sect .",
    "[ t8.5 ] ) .",
    "we conclude the paper with a few remarks on integrability and universality .",
    "the most fundamental concept of statistical physics is the distinction between _ microstates _ and _ macrostates _ in the description of systems with many degrees of freedom . to fix ideas ,",
    "consider a classical @xmath3-particle system ( say , a gas in a box ) described by a hamilton function @xmath8 of position variables @xmath9 and momenta @xmath10 .",
    "particles move in a region @xmath11 of volume @xmath12 .",
    "then a _ microstate _ is simply a point @xmath13 in phase space , whereas a _ macrostate _ will be defined for the purposes of these lectures as a measure @xmath14 parameterized by a set of _ macroscopic _ state variables ( in short _ macrovariables",
    "@xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 is a function on phase space and @xmath17 denotes the canonical liouville measure .",
    "examples of macrovariables are energy , density , temperature or pressure .",
    "the macrovariables parametrizing the macrostate @xmath18 could have a dependence on space and time , but to be useful they should be chosen such that they are slowly varying .",
    "this singles out in particular the conserved quantities of the underlying @xmath3-particle system as candidates for macrovariables .",
    "the mapping from the microstate @xmath13 to the macrovariables @xmath15 is many - to - one , and the measure @xmath14 gives the probability to find the system in a particular set of microstates @xmath13 under the constraint that the macroscopic state is described by @xmath15 . in principle , the time dependence ( if any ) of @xmath16 is induced by the classical hamiltonian dynamics of the microstate variables @xmath13 , but in practice well - chosen macrovariables are often found to satisfy autonomous evolution laws , such as the equations of hydrodynamics .",
    "the derivation of macroscopic evolution equations from microscopic hamiltonian dynamics is the goal of _ kinetic theory_. a ( much simplified ) version of this problem will be addressed below in sect .",
    "[ hydro ] .    in this perspective , _ equilibrium states _ are a subclass of macrostates which are attained at long times by a system that is isolated or in contact with a time - independent , spatially uniform environment .",
    "characteristic properties of equilibrium states are that    * the macrovariables @xmath15 are time - independent and spatially homogeneous , and * there are no macroscopic currents ( e.g. , of mass or energy ) .",
    "the two most important examples of equilibrium states are the following :    * in an _ isolated _ system the energy @xmath19 is conserved , the appropriate macrovariables are @xmath20 and the equilibrium state is the measure induced by the liouville measure on the energy shell @xmath21 .",
    "this is known in physics as the _ microcanonical _ measure . * in a system at _ constant temperature _",
    "@xmath22 particles exchange energy with the walls of the box @xmath23 in such a way that the mean energy is fixed .",
    "the appropriate macrovariables are then @xmath24 and the equilibrium state is of the form @xmath25 , \\;\\;\\ ; \\beta = 1/t,\\ ] ] known as the _ canonical _ measure .",
    "having roughly characterized equilibrium states , we may say that _",
    "states arise whenever the conditions for the establishment of equilibrium are not fulfilled . as such",
    ", this definition is about as useful as it would be to define some area of biology as the study of non - elephants",
    ". we can be somewhat more precise by making a distinction between    * _ systems approaching equilibrium .",
    "_ by definition , the macrostate of such a system is time - dependent .",
    "in addition , systems in this class often become spatially inhomogeneous ; an important and much studied case are systems undergoing phase separation @xcite . * _ nonequilibrium stationary states ( ness ) . _",
    "these systems are kept out of equilibrium by external influences .",
    "they are stationary , in the sense that macroscopic state variables are time - independent , and they may or may not be spatially homogeneous . in any case",
    "they are characterized by non - vanishing macroscopic currents .",
    "examples for ness are    * _ heat conduction .",
    "_ in a system with boundaries held at different temperatures there is a stationary energy current proportional to the temperature gradient ( _ fourier s law _ ) .",
    "* _ diffusion .",
    "_ in a system coupled to particle reservoirs held at different densities there is a mass current proportional to the density gradient ( _ fick s law _ ) . *",
    "_ electric conduction .",
    "_ here particles are charged and move under the influence of a constant electric field .",
    "the particle current is proportional to the field strength ( _ ohm s law _ ) .    among these three examples ,",
    "the first two can be further characterized as _ boundary driven _ , in the sense that the ness is maintained by boundary conditions on the quantity that is being transported ( heat , mass ) , whereas the last example illustrates a _ bulk - driven _ ness maintained by an external field acting in the bulk of the system .",
    "ness are the simplest examples of nonequilibrium states . nevertheless , their description in the framework of classical hamiltonian mechanics is conceptually subtle and technically demanding ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the main reason is that a hamiltonian system under constant driving inevitably accumulates energy .",
    "in order to allow for the establishment of a steady state , dissipation has to be introduced through the coupling to an external reservoir , that is , a system with an infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "these difficulties can be avoided by starting from _ stochastic _ microscopic dynamics . while less realistic on the microscopic level , stochastic models provide a versatile framework for addressing fundamental questions associated with the behavior of many - particle systems far from equilibrium .",
    "the class of models of interest here are known in the probabilistic community as _ interacting particle systems_. these are lattice models with a discrete ( finite or infinite ) set of states associated with each lattice site and local interactions .",
    "we focus specifically on exclusion processes , which are introduced in the next section .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the notion of equilibrium states in statistical physics , as outlined above , is much more restrictive than the usage of the corresponding term in most areas of mathematics , where an _ equilibrium _ is commonly understood to be any time - independent solution of some deterministic or stochastic time evolution .",
    "thus ness are equilibria in the mathematical sense . in sect .",
    "[ markov ] we will give a precise definition of what distinguishes physical equilibria from other time - independent states in the context of continuous time markov chains .",
    "the simple exclusion process was introduced in 1970 by frank spitzer @xcite .",
    "particles occupy the sites of a @xmath26-dimensional lattice , which for the purposes of this discussion will be taken to be a finite subset @xmath27 .",
    "the particles are indistinguishable , which implies that a microstate or configuration of the system is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 ( 1 ) if site @xmath30 is vacant ( occupied ) .",
    "the dynamics can be informally described as follows ( for a detailed construction see @xcite ) :    * each particle carries a clock which rings according to a poisson process with unit rate ( i.e. , the waiting times between rings are exponentially distributed ) .",
    "* when the clock rings the particle at site @xmath30 selects a target site @xmath31 with probability @xmath32 and attempts to jump there .",
    "* the jump is performed if the target site is vacant and discarded otherwise ; this step implements the _ exclusion interaction _ between particles and enforces the single occupancy constraint @xmath29 or 1 .",
    "together these rules define the exclusion process as a continuous time markov chain on a finite state space ; some general properties of such chains will be discussed in the next section .",
    "_ interactions _ ( beyond the exclusion interaction ) can be introduced through the dependence of the jump matrix @xmath33 on the configuration @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , _",
    "inhomogeneity _ associated with sites or particles can be introduced by letting the waiting times and the jump matrix depend explicitly on the particle positions or the particle labels , see @xcite .",
    "we next restrict the discussion to the one - dimensional case with nearest neighbor hopping and without inhomogeneities or explicit interactions . then @xmath35 informally , the particle attempts to jump to the right with probability @xmath36 and to the left with probability @xmath37 .",
    "the following cases are of interest :    * @xmath38 defines the _ symmetric simple exclusion process _ ( ssep ) .",
    "we will see below that this is really an equilibrium system .",
    "however , when defined on a finite lattice of sites @xmath39 and supplemented with boundary rates @xmath40 which govern the injection @xmath41 and extraction @xmath42 of particles at the boundary sites @xmath43 and @xmath44 , this model provides a nontrivial example for a boundary - driven ness @xcite . *",
    "@xmath45 defines the _ asymmetric simple exclusion process _ ( asep ) .",
    "when considered on the one - dimensional ring ( a lattice with _ periodic boundary conditions _ ) the system attains a bulk - driven ness in which there is a non - vanishing stationary mass current .",
    "this is the simplest realization of a _ driven diffusive system _ @xcite .",
    "+ note that the boundary conditions are crucial here . on a finite lattice with closed ends , which prevent particles from entering or leaving the system , an _ equilibrium",
    "_ state is established in which the bias in the jump probability is compensated by a density gradient ; this is the discrete analog of a gas in a gravitational field , as described by the barometric formula .",
    "another possibility is to consider a finite lattice with open ends at which particles are injected and extracted at specified rates @xcite .",
    "this leads to a ness with a surprisingly complex structure , see @xcite for review . *",
    "@xmath46 ( or 0 ) defines the _ totally asymmetric simple exclusion process _",
    "( tasep ) .",
    "in contrast to the case of general @xmath36 , this process can also be formulated in discrete time @xcite : in one time step @xmath47 , all particles attempt to move to the right ( say ) simultaneously and independently with probability @xmath48 $ ] ; moves to vacant sites are accepted and moves to occupied sites discarded .",
    "such a discrete time dynamics can not be defined for @xmath49 , because it would lead to conflicts when different particles attempt to simultaneously access the same vacant site .",
    "+ for @xmath50 the discrete time tasep ( _ dtasep _ ) reduces to the continuous time process in rescaled time @xmath51 , while for @xmath52 it becomes a deterministic cellular automaton which has number 184 in wolfram s classification @xcite .",
    "the case of general @xmath53 has been studied mostly in the context of vehicular traffic modeling @xcite .",
    "+ note that in terms of the waiting time picture sketched above , the discrete time dynamics corresponds to replacing the exponential waiting time distribution by a geometric distribution with support on integer times only .",
    "the exponential and geometric waiting time distributions are the only ones that encode _ markovian _ dynamics @xcite .",
    "the waiting time representation will play an important role in the exact solution of the dtasep presented below in sect.[tsec : c ] .      before discussing some specific properties of exclusion processes",

    "the transition probability satisfies the evolution equation @xmath64 which is known as the _ master equation _ in physics @xcite and as the _ forward equation _ in the theory of stochastic processes @xcite . here",

    "to see this , consider the total transition rates for all processes leading into or out of a given configuration @xmath34 .",

    "the invariant measure of the dtasep on the ring is _ not _ uniform .",

    "an important goal in the study of stochastic interacting particle systems is to understand how deterministic evolution equations emerge from the stochastic microscopic dynamics on large scales @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the ( much harder ) problem of deriving hydrodynamic equations from the newtonian dynamics of molecules in a gas or a fluid .",

    "the first explicit demonstration of this idea was presented by prhofer and spohn in a series of papers @xcite , where an alternative and independent route linking ulam s problem to growth models was established .",
    "the starting point is the one - dimensional polynuclear growth model ( png ) , an interacting particle system on the real line , in which particles ( antiparticles ) move deterministically at unit speed to the right ( left ) , annihilate upon colliding , and are created in pairs according to a two - dimensional poisson process in space and time @xcite . via the random set of particle creation events",
    "the model can be mapped onto the problem of the longest increasing subsequence of a random permutation , which in turn provides a link to the tracy - widom distribution @xcite . for the case of a droplet growing from a seed ( case iii of sect .",
    "[ kpz_conjecture ] ) , prhofer and spohn show that the resulting fluctuation distribution is identical ( under the rescaling prescribed by kpz theory ) to that obtained by johansson for the dtasep .    moreover , by imposing suitable boundary conditions @xcite and symmetry relations @xcite on the set of poisson points , the cases of flat and rough initial conditions ( case i and ii of sect .",
    "[ kpz_conjecture ] ) can be handled as well @xcite .",
    "for the flat initial condition ( case i ) the fluctuations are governed by the goe distribution @xmath439 , while for the rough initial condition ( case ii ) a new distribution @xmath440 emerges which so far does not have an interpretation in terms of random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "the three distributions are depicted in fig .  [ 3functions](a ) .    since the fundamental works of johansson , prhofer and spohn the field has developed rapidly , and it is impossible to do justice to the new results in the framework of these lecture notes . in the following subsections",
    "we therefore restrict ourselves to briefly outlining the most important directions of research , providing the interested reader with a few key references along which recent advances can be traced .",
    "based on the universality hypothesis , prhofer and spohn translated the results obtained for the png model into a conjecture for the fluctuations of the particle current through the origin for the tasep with a general step initial condition ( [ step ] ) , where particles are placed to the left ( right ) of the origin according to a bernoulli measure with density @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) @xcite . the fluctuation phase diagram in the plane of the boundary densities",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ 3functions](b ) .",
    "the overall features of the diagram can be understood from hydrodynamics .",
    "first , the johansson result obtained at @xmath441 , @xmath442 is seen to extend throughout the region @xmath250 . as explained in sect .",
    "[ kpz_conjecture ] , this reflects the fact that the density profile near the origin is independent of the boundary densities in this case . for @xmath443 and @xmath444 the application of the hydrodynamic formulae ( [ wave ] ) [ for @xmath445 and ( [ shockspeed ] ) [ for @xmath446 show that the density at the origin becomes @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . in these cases",
    "the intrinsic current fluctuations are masked by the initial fluctuations drifting across the origin , leading to simple gaussian statistics ( regions marked g in the diagram ) .",
    "the line @xmath447 , @xmath448 , is special , because there the shock speed ( [ shockspeed ] ) vanishes and the density at the origin shifts randomly between @xmath6 and @xmath7 . as a consequence",
    ", the current is distributed as the maximum of two independent gaussian random variables ( denoted by g@xmath449 in the figure ) .",
    "similarly , along the lines @xmath450 , @xmath451 , and @xmath452 , @xmath453 , the distribution is that of the maximum of two independent variables drawn from @xmath439",
    ". finally , at the point @xmath454 we have case ii behavior governed by the distribution @xmath440 .    a proof of the prhofer - spohn conjecture for the tasep was recently presented by ben arous and corwin @xcite ( see also @xcite for earlier partial results ) .",
    "moreover , in a remarkable series of papers tracy and widom have been able to generalize these results to the ( partially ) asymmetric exclusion process @xcite .",
    "the generalization is highly nontrivial , because the asep for general @xmath36 is not a determinental process @xcite , and it requires a novel set of techniques based on the bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "we have seen in sect .",
    "[ kpz_conjecture ] that the essence of the kpz conjecture is the universality of height fluctuations when viewed on the appropriate scales defined by the height rescaling ( [ heightscaled ] ) and the correlation length ( [ correlation_length ] ) . in other words , once the average growth shape has been subtracted , one expects that the rescaled fluctuations @xmath455 converge for @xmath368 to a universal stochastic process @xmath456 , whose single - point distribution is one of the random matrix distributions discussed above .",
    "the process @xmath456 was first explicitly characterized by prhofer and spohn for the png - model in the droplet geometry ( case iii of sect .",
    "[ kpz_conjecture ] ) , who named it the _ airy process _ @xcite .",
    "subsequently sasamoto identified the analogous process for the case of flat initial conditions ( case i ) @xcite . in line with",
    "the nomenclature used to designate the corresponding single - point distributions ( @xmath341 for case iii and @xmath439 for case i ) , the two processes are now called airy@xmath457 and airy@xmath458 processes , respectively @xcite . whereas the airy@xmath457 process has a natural interpretation in the random matrix context as the motion of the largest eigenvalue in gue matrix diffusion ( dyson s brownian motion ) , the corresponding relation does not hold for the airy@xmath458 process @xcite .",
    "the corresponding process for initial conditions with stationary roughness ( case ii ) was studied in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in recent work ferrari and",
    "collaborators have extended the analysis to include correlations between height fluctuations at different times @xmath57 and @xmath459 . as for the scaling of the height fluctuations themselves",
    ", the characteristics of the hydrodynamic equation play a special role for the decay of correlations .",
    "whereas the decay along generic space - time directions is governed by the correlation length ( [ correlation_length ] ) , which is of order @xmath248 , along the characteristics the decorrelation time at time @xmath57 is set by @xmath57 itself , which implies a much slower decay @xcite .",
    "this is in accordance with kpz phenomenology , which predicts that such correlations should decay as @xmath460 with a universal autocorrelation exponent @xmath461 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the scaling exponents of single - point height fluctuations introduced in sect .",
    "[ kpz_conjecture ] , the autocorrelation exponent depends explicitly on the growth geometry : for a flat initial condition ( case i ) @xmath462 , whereas for a curved cluster ( case iii ) @xmath463 @xcite .",
    "the results described so far in this section were based on a small set of exactly solvable models , the ( t)asep s and the png model . on the other hand ,",
    "kpz universality is expected to hold for a much broader class of interacting particle systems and growth models which is limited only by the requirement of local , stochastic transition rules and a nonlinear dependence of the particle current ( or growth rate ) on the particle density ( or surface slope ) [ see sect .  [ kpz_conjecture ] ] .",
    "it is therefore gratifying that the class of models for which kpz universality has been rigorously established  mostly in the sense of finding the exact scaling exponents governing the order of fluctuations  has been greatly expanded in recent years .",
    "this has required the development of new techniques that are purely probabilistic in nature and do not rely on the specific analytic structure of the exactly solvable models .",
    "the first result of this type was obtained in @xcite for the hammersley process , an exlusion - type process in continuous space which is closely related to the ulam problem .",
    "similar methods were subsequently applied to a variety of interacting particle systems @xcite , including a class of zero range processes with general jump rates that have a non - decreasing , concave dependence on the number of particles @xcite .",
    "this constitutes a major step on the way to proving kpz universality in the broadest sense .",
    "ironically , although tremendous advances in the analysis of different representatives of the kpz universality class were achieved over the past decade , the one - dimensional kpz equation ( [ kpz ] ) itself remained rather poorly understood .",
    "we noted already that the kpz equation is mathematically ill - posed because of the highly singular white noise term , and some regularization is needed to make it amenable to rigorous analysis .",
    "this can be done by spatial discretization or by constructing the equation through a scaling limit from an asymmetric exclusion process with weak asymmetry @xcite .",
    "both approaches have recently been used to prove the correct order of fluctuations in the kpz equation @xcite as well as refined universality in the sense of the tracy - widom distribution @xcite .",
    "thus it has finally been established , as it were , that the kpz equation belongs to its own universality class .    in another line of work an independent , non - rigorous approach to establishing",
    "tracy - widom universality has been developed which is based on applying the replica method to the path weight @xmath221 in the hopf - cole transformed equation ( [ z(x , t ) ] ) . in this approach one",
    "computes moments @xmath464 with respect to the stochastic force @xmath192 , which results in a problem of @xmath180 bosonic , quantum - mechanical particles interacting through an attractive @xmath197-function potential @xcite .",
    "while the ground - state energy and wave function of this quantum system been known for a long time , the recent works @xcite have succeeded in summing over the full spectrum of excited states of the many - body hamiltonian .          despite the wide applicability of the kpz theory to a large class of stochastic growth models , experimental signatures of kpz scaling in the real physical world",
    "have proven to be surprisingly elusive .",
    "early efforts focused on the investigation of growth - induced ( two - dimensional ) surface roughness of crystals and thin solid films @xcite .",
    "however , detailed consideration of the physical processes governing such growth experiments has revealed that they typically operate in regimes where kpz asymptotics is practically out of reach @xcite . to date ,",
    "the most thoroughly studied experimental system that displays kpz scaling is the slow , flameless combustion of paper . by imaging and analyzing the one - dimensional smoldering front ,",
    "the @xmath413-scaling of fluctuations @xcite as well as the non - gaussian shape of the corresponding probability distribution @xcite were demonstrated .",
    "very recently , a new experimental system involving different phases of driven , turbulent liquid crystal films became available , in which the refined universality predictions of the theory can be tested with unprecedented precision @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ kazumasa ] we show a series of snapshots of the growing turbulent droplet along with the experimentally determined distribution of shape fluctuations . under the rescaling prescribed by kpz theory ,",
    "the predicted universal gue distribution is seen to emerge from the data without any adjustable parameters .",
    "the central model discussed in our paper is the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) .",
    "this model has two features that motivate our choice .",
    "firstly , it belongs to the class of stochastic interacting particle systems that are useful in the study of transport phenomena in nonequilibrium systems .",
    "we are particularly interested in the description of fluctuations around the mean behavior which is governed by a deterministic evolution equation . in general",
    "it is difficult to obtain such detailed information , mainly because the interactions between the particles destroy stochastic independence and the classical central limit theorem can not be applied .",
    "however , and this is the second feature , tasep is an exactly solvable model and the fluctuations can be analyzed by a series of beautiful and non - obvious observations .",
    "we have seen by explicit calculation that the fluctuations of the flux are described by a formula that is structurally the same as the formula for the fluctuations of the largest eigenvalue of matrices from the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) .",
    "this provides one explanation for the much celebrated link to random matrix theory .",
    "there are also links to the theory of integrable systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) that we have not explained at all and that we mention here only in order to give an indication why tasep is sometimes called an integrable model , even though there is no differential equation to integrate in sight .",
    "a common feature of integrable systems is that their delicate mathematical structure immediately breaks down if the model is changed ever so slightly .",
    "one may think that this limits the interest in the corresponding results .",
    "however , the recurring experience with integrable systems has been , that even though the method of proof is not applicable if the model is changed , the results may persist . in our context",
    "a nice example of this principle of universality is the recent work of tracy and widom where it is shown by very different methods that a number of results for tasep also hold for asep .",
    "universality results are also available for large classes of matrix ensembles ( see @xcite and references therein ) . despite these results ,",
    "the question of universality is a subtle one as can be seen for example from the correlations of the fluctuations ( cf .",
    "@xcite and sect .",
    "[ t8.2 ] ) .",
    "it remains a great challenge to understand the realm of validity of the various laws that have been established for the specific integrable models .",
