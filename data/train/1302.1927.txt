    "all solutions depicted in figures [ figure3 ]  [ figure2 ] take the same parameters ( @xmath81 @xmath229 ) and @xmath250 .",

    "blocks of balls emerge several times but disappear in distant sites .",

    "@xmath255 $ ] ( for all @xmath108 ) , each block appears only one time and the solutions express the well known soliton solutions for this system .",
    "this type of solution is also a compressed representation for the state with regularly - positioned blocks of balls .",
    "however , this compressed solution is easily rewritten from the non - compressed ( well - known ) one , i.e. , it is not a new solution .    of course , we can consider the case where the @xmath256 are semi - infinite . for such cases",
    ", the corresponding block appears in a pattern for sufficiently large @xmath179 but never for sufficiently small @xmath179 ( or vice versa ) .",

    "in this paper , we have discussed properties for a class of multi - variable quadratic functions and we have proven that these functions solve the ultradiscrete kdv equation .",
    "we have also proposed a new type of solutions by restricting parameters , for example , multi - periodic solutions .    in our previous papers @xcite , @xcite , we proposed a recursive representation of soliton solutions for the ultradiscrete soliton equations including the ultradiscrete kdv equation .",
    "this representation can be considered as a transformation from a soliton solution to another one , that is , a transformation between two states in the same dynamics  the standard bbs , with infinite and open boundary condition .",
    "however , the recursive representation ( [ vertexop ] ) can not be regarded as transformation between two  standard \" forms of solutions to pbbs , because of the shift of the parameter @xmath80 between @xmath61 and @xmath83 . in other words , when we obtain a standard form by applying the recursive form ( [ vertexop ] ) repeatedly from the vacuum solution @xmath90 , the intermediate states are not standard forms except for some special cases ( for example when all @xmath81 are equal ) . it should be noted that relation ( [ vertexop ] ) is an extension of a recursive representation of soliton solutions . when restricting @xmath259 $ ] , we can omit the term of @xmath260 in ( [ vertexop ] ) by replacing @xmath261 because of @xmath262 for @xmath263 .",
    "the representation presented here is suitable for only analyzing the standard bbs .    as seen in the proof of theorem [ mainthm ] , it is important to consider the state of @xmath65 , which corresponds to each state of the bbs .",
    "especially , the case ( ix ) corresponds to the interaction of solitons . in @xcite , it was sufficient to consider only two cases , interacting or not , to describe the dynamics of the ultradiscrete toda molecule equation .",
    "however , for the ultradiscrete kdv equation , we also have to consider an additional case   injecting \" balls .",
    "the reason for this complexity results from the introduction of coordinates @xmath179 for boxes to represent the box and ball dynamics .",
    "it is also known that the bbs has waves called  backgrounds \" which can take various value and travel at speed @xmath139 and arbitrary initial states consist of solitons and backgrounds .",
    "cauchy problems can be exactly solved by virtue of an ultradiscrete analogue of the inverse scattering method @xcite .",
    "however , our approach in this paper can not be applied to states that include backgrounds , as it depends strongly on good combinatorial properties of the solitons .",
    "we also note that the discussion in the previous sections becomes much easier in the case @xmath255 $ ] ( for all @xmath108 ) because we consider only limited cases . specifically",
    ", we do not need to employ proposition [ negative ] , or most of theorem [ relt ] .",
    "therefore , we can present an induction free discussion , such as proposed in @xcite .",
    "we believe that discrete convexity plays a very important role for the @xmath264-functions of the ultradiscrete systems . in this paper however , we only used convexity for some propositions which are not so essential .",
    "the quadratic function ( [ deff ] ) is certainly convex and has good combinatorial properties .",
    "however , we can not obtain good properties of the solution @xmath61 itself .",
    "we also note that the independent variables @xmath178 and @xmath179 in ( [ deftau ] ) can be extended to real values , but @xmath67 in ( [ deff ] ) can not .",
    "the discreteness for @xmath67 is considered to be essential .",
    "it is expected that a direct relationship between these notions and fundamental properties of integrable systems such as the plcker relations , and can be expressed in the language of discrete convex analysis .",
