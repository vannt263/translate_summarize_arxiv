    "contrary to the phase - attractive case , time - evolution of the phase - repulsive networks does not always exhibit exponential relaxation , and directly depends on the network topology  @xcite . to illustrate this",

    "they also exhibit large variations within each group with the same @xmath2 , which indicates that the total network frustration strongly depends on both topology and @xmath2 .",
    "the network group with @xmath51 links ( networks 61 - 80 ) exhibits the largest variation in frustration values depending on topology ; it is also the last group where a fully stretched state with @xmath40 is obtainable .",
    "other groups with medium @xmath2 ( from @xmath52 to @xmath53 ) display the same trend of topology  frustration relationship , despite containing different number of networks .",
    "some groups also include many networks with similar topologies that all have the same value of @xmath28 .",
    "we first examine the networks with a unique frustration state focusing on the @xmath51 group . in fig.[fig-4 ] we show the networks 61 and 80 which display minimal and maximal @xmath28-values in this group , respectively @xmath40 and @xmath54 .",

    "in contrast to this , networks 70 and 74 have similar @xmath28-values despite having rather different topologies .",
    "two networks show very different organization of containing the frustration : while network 70 distributes it over 8 links , network 74 confines it into only 2 links , while completely stretching the other 7 .",
    "network 74 includes two 4-diamonds , which in this case display the same frustration pattern as if they were isolated .",
    "each topology has its own way of managing the frustration , that depends on its particularities such as symmetry or modularity .",
    "next we study the examples of networks with multiple frustration states . in fig.[fig-5 ] we show all 11 of them , visualized in both states and identified by their numbers as described above ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig-3 ] ) . for each frustration state",
    "we report the @xmath28-value , along with the fraction of ip leading to it ( in parenthesis ) .",

    "both states are stable , but the more squeezed one @xmath55 occurs for a smaller fraction of ip ( only 14% ) .",
    "this is to say that both states are stable fixed points ( sinks ) for the dynamical system eq.eq-2 with 6-ring topology , but the @xmath40 state has a bigger basin of attraction .",
    "network 35 is a 6-ring with an additional link inside : two frustration states differ in distributing the frustration between these two subnetworks .",

    "their dynamics is a competition between a 4-ring and two 3-rings in escaping the frustration .",
    "the @xmath56 state of network 55 exhibits a discrete degeneracy : opposite pairs of links in 4-ring can swap their @xmath27-values without changing @xmath28 , while the @xmath57 state shows a continuous degeneracy , similar to 4-clique .",
    "the remaining multistable networks display similar patterns : the difference between two states generally lies in the competition between two network s structural elements in escaping the frustration by attempting to stretch to the maximal attainable phase difference . the choice of ip pre - defines the final state",
    ". the states with lower @xmath28-values are usually more preferred .",
    "the exception to this is network 79 : its higher @xmath28 state appears more frequently , despite the lower @xmath28 state involving a uniform distribution of @xmath27-values over all links .",
    "two @xmath28-values are typically close , although not always ( network 11 ) .",
    "additional stable states are in principle possible for some networks , but with extremely small basins of attraction , which makes them very difficult to observe .",
    "each of the above networks was tested for @xmath58 ip , and no third stable state was found .",
    "relaxation of the six - node networks displays the same exponential and power - law convergence patterns observed earlier ( fig.[fig-2 ] ) .",
    "power - law relaxation , testifying about the non - equilibrium processes on the network , is typically found on the network such as 74 ( fig.[fig-4 ] ) , which concentrate their entire frustration into a few completely squeezed links ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "interestingly , we revealed various power - law slopes for some links in those networks , that indicate different squeezing strengths exerted by the rest of the network , which is a direct consequence of their specific topologies  @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to consider the distributions ( over ip ) of initial total frustration @xmath28 for various networks , since they reflect their topological symmetries . in fig.[fig-6 ] ( top panel ) we show the distributions of @xmath28-values at time @xmath59 for networks 54 , 11 and 61 ( cf .",

    "the clustering of frustration states is another property of phase - repulsive dynamics that reflects the network topological details .",
    "note that this classification seems not to be directly correlated with the values of @xmath74 and @xmath76 : for instance , states @xmath98 and @xmath96 are far from each other despite having almost the same @xmath28-values .",
    "below we investigate the transitions between the frustration states on the 20-node network induced by the random perturbations of the network dynamics . to this end",
    "we modify the eq.eq-2 by adding the kick term : @xmath100 which acts at time @xmath101 by independently perturbing the dynamics of each node  @xcite .",
    "for each kick and each node , we randomly choose the kicking strength @xmath102 from a gaussian distribution centered at zero with standard deviation 2 , and the phase - shifts @xmath103 uniformly from @xmath104 .",
    "the network is prepared at time @xmath101 in state @xmath75 , after which the kick is applied . upon perturbation ,",
    "the network settles into a new state @xmath92 .",
    "this procedure is repeated @xmath49 times for each starting state @xmath75 , and the transitions @xmath105 are recorded .",
    "we denote with @xmath93 the fraction of random kicks leading from the state @xmath75 to the state @xmath92 .",
    "the matrix of transitions is reported in fig.[fig-12]b , where the scale shows the values of @xmath93 .",
    "the matrix is of course non - symmetric , since it is easier to induce the transitions from a higher to a lower @xmath28 state than vice versa .",
    "similarly , the transitions from a more preferred into a less preferred state are more common than the inverse transitions . in general , each state @xmath75 appears to have more and less preferred states @xmath92 into which it jumps .",
    "the obtained transition rates seem to reflect the clustering of the states according to the matrix of hamming distances shown in fig.[fig-12]a : the high @xmath28 states prefer to jump into lower @xmath28 states that belong to their own cluster . for instance",
    ", while all states jump into @xmath77 and @xmath94 ( with various ratios ) , only some states jump into @xmath95 , such as members of its cluster @xmath96 and @xmath79 .",
    "interestingly , among the very few transitions occurring from a lower into a higher @xmath28 state , most start from @xmath77 , while all others occur within a given cluster .",
    "a special role is played by the transitions that do not change the frustration state , i.e. @xmath106 , which are the diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath93 in fig.[fig-12]b .",
    "they are indicators of the robustness of a given state against the perturbations .",
    "we show the values of @xmath85 in fig.[fig-9]b for comparison with the corresponding @xmath76 in fig.[fig-9]a .",
    "the ratios of @xmath85-values only partially reflect the ratios of @xmath76-values : while @xmath77 and @xmath94 are the most robust states , higher @xmath28 states are more robust than expected , in particular @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the value of @xmath76  fraction of ip leading to @xmath75 ( basin of attraction ) , can be seen as the `` width '' of the potential hole defining @xmath75 .",
    "similarly , the value @xmath85 can be understood as the `` depth '' of the potential hole , as it indicates how strong perturbation is needed to jump out of @xmath75 .",
    "the comparison of fig.[fig-9]a and fig.[fig-9]b reveals that depths and widths of the states are not completely correlated : low @xmath28 states are wide and relatively deep , while many high @xmath28 states are only somewhat shallower despite being much narrower .",
    "note that the selection of the kicking strengths is done appropriately to allow for these properties to be observed .",
    "very strong perturbations would erase the memory of starting state @xmath75 , and all transitions would follow the same probabilities as if starting from random ip .",
    "finally , we examine the uniqueness of the network frustration profile ( shown in fig.[fig-9]a ) in relation to the network topology .",
    "we implement the link mutation scheme as follows : one node of the original network and one of its links are chosen at random .",
    "the link is then re - wired to a different ( randomly chosen ) node , making sure that the network stays connected .",
    "the resulting network differs from the original one only in a single link , so it is still `` topologically close '' to it .",
    "we compute the statistics of @xmath74 and @xmath76 for many mutation examples : the profile always drastically differs from the original profile from fig.[fig-9]a . to illustrate this , we show in fig.[fig-13 ] the original profile ( black ) , together with three examples of profiles obtained for networks with a single link mutation .",
    "a ) , along with three different profiles obtained for three examples of mutated network ( see text for details ) . ]",
    "the first of them has 20 states , while the second one has only 4 ; the third profile has the most preferred state different from the lowest @xmath28 one .",
    "it appears that even a single link mutation , which only marginally changes the topology , yields a dramatic change in the number and the properties of the frustration states .",
    "this extreme sensitivity of multistability to the topology again testifies about the intricate relationship between them ; it appears that the frustration profile is in general unique for large networks .",
    "this can facilitate the reconstruction of the phase - repulsive networks from the dynamical data , in which context various methods are already in use  @xcite .",
    "we studied the collective dynamics of identical kuramoto oscillators with phase - repulsive interactions on non - directed complex networks .",
    "various network sizes and topologies were considered : all 112 connected six - node networks were systematically examined , in addition to a preferential attachment grown 20-node network . in opposition to the phase - attractive case ,",
    "our model involves dynamical frustration resulting from the tendency of linked oscillator pairs to attain the maximal difference of @xmath21 between them , which is not always possible due to the network s topological complexity .",
    "we showed that each network has its characteristic total frustration @xmath28 , which largely depends on its size and topology .",
    "moreover , certain networks display multiple frustration states in relation to different initial conditions , which can be classified into clusters . transitions between states also reflect topological details and cluster organization .",
    "as we finally showed , the profile of frustration states appears to be a unique `` fingerprint '' for each network , which is associated with methods of detecting the network structure from dynamical data  @xcite .    in the presence of noise our model",
    "is expected to exhibit less frustration states ; shallow states such as @xmath79 in 20-node network will immediately become unstable",
    ". with increase of noise strength more states will lose stability , finally reaching the point where only a single state will remain accessible .",
    "this state will thus be the unique final dynamical state for a phase - repulsive network .    for networks with the ring topology the @xmath28 value",
    "is directly related to the ring s parity .",
    "recall from fig.[fig-1 ] that 2-node network and 4-ring have @xmath40 , while 3-ring has @xmath57 . to systematically study this ,",
    "we show in fig.[fig-14 ] the @xmath28-values of rings as function of number of nodes @xmath0 .",
    "rings with even @xmath0 always have the lowest @xmath28 value @xmath40 ; on the other hand , rings with odd @xmath0 are always frustrated , but their lowest @xmath28-value approaches zero .      with increase of @xmath0",
    ", rings display a growing number of multiple frustration states , starting with 6-ring ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig-5 ] ) .",
    "multiple @xmath28-values exhibit a periodic pattern with @xmath0 .",
    "the range of attainable @xmath28-values shrinks with increase of @xmath0 , approaching zero at the limit @xmath110 , where the ring topology approaches that of a chain .",
    "the relationship between frustration and parity is associated with the methods of detecting network _ motifs _",
    " overrepresented subnetworks with specific topologies  @xcite . some methods of searching for network rings are already in use  @xcite . since link frustration @xmath27 contains local network information , it could be in principle used for motif detection . however , this will crucially depend on the way motif is embedded in the network  both 4-diamond and 4-clique ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig-1 ] ) contain 3-ring as motif , but its @xmath27-values are different from those found on isolated 3-ring .",
    "one could also seek to generalize the idea of parity in the context of networks and find a common topological property for all networks with @xmath40 .",
    "another immediate question revolves around the number of frustration states in relation to the network connectivity ( number of links @xmath2 ) . to examine this we construct erds - rnyi random graphs with @xmath111 nodes , taking multiples of 10 for @xmath2 between @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( @xmath114 )  @xcite . for each @xmath2-value",
    ", we construct 100 different random graph realizations , and record the total number of observed states after 200 runs ( phase - repulsive dynamics is implemented as previously ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig-15 ] : biggest numbers of states ( @xmath115 ) most often occur on sparse networks around @xmath116 .",
    "sparse networks also exhibit the largest range of possible number of states depending on the topology , and seem always to have no less than 5 states .",
    "with increase of @xmath2 , networks typically display between 1 and 30 states , which does not substantially change even for very big @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "too sparse networks have even less states .",
    "this result might relate to the sparse connectivity observed in many biological and technological networks  @xcite , and emphasize the dynamical properties of sparse topologies .",
    "this also indicates the optimal range of network connectivity for modeling complex multistable systems . the 20-node network studied in section [ s - transitions ]",
    "is also sparse .",
    "a further question regards the design of networks with minimal or maximal total frustration .",
    "we showed in figs.[fig-3]&[fig-4 ] that a network with a fixed number of links may have very different @xmath28-values depending on its topology .",
    "it would be interesting to examine the topological differences between large networks with fixed @xmath2 having minimal and maximal @xmath28 .",
    "picturing @xmath28 as an elastic potential energy contained in the network , this model may indicate the design algorithms for construction of maximally squeezed ( or stretched ) elastic networks .",
    "similar question refers to the networks with minimal or maximal number of states , which might be of interest in modeling multistable complex systems ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig-15 ] ) .",
    "future generalizations include networks with non - identical oscillators , which are expected to exhibit an even wider spectrum of frustration states , including multirhythmicity  @xcite .",
    "the interaction function @xmath117 from eq.eq-1 was here taken @xmath16 , although other choices of odd @xmath117 might be interesting .",
    "repulsive dynamics on directed and weighted networks is still poorly understood .",
    "the stability of the fixed points of dynamical system eq.eq-2 can also be investigated analytically , using the network laplacian defined as @xmath118  @xcite .",
    "drawing conclusions about network multistability by examining @xmath119 might allow more detailed and systematic insights .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to study the properties of the laplacian eigenvalues in relation to the network relaxation patterns ( cf .",
