    "there has recently been considerable progress in the understanding of the nonperturbative physics of string compactification",
    ". a fairly realistic model which would be very nice to understand would be the heterotic string compactified on a  threefold as this leads to an @xmath2 theory in four dimensions . here",
    "we will deal with the more modest model of a heterotic string compactified on a k3 surface to yield an @xmath2 theory in six dimensions .    starting with the work of @xcite",
    "it was realized that the structure of the heterotic string on a k3 surface could be related to the geometry of a  threefold . in particular",
    "that the type iia string on this  space was dual to the heterotic string compactified on a product of a k3 surface and a 2-torus .",
    "recall that the heterotic string requires a bundle structure for its compactification and so this product of k3 and a torus also comes equipped with a bundle .    by a process known as f - theory @xcite one can analyze only the parts of the  threefold , @xmath3 , that are relevent to the k3 part of the compactification and ignore the 2-torus part . in order to do this",
    ", @xmath3 must be in the form of an elliptic fibration with section @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a complex surface . for a precise statement of this",
    "see @xcite .",
    "this may be viewed in two ways .",
    "firstly one may take the area of the @xmath6 to be large and switch off any wilson lines around it and watch how @xmath3 degenerates .",
    "alternatively one may perform a fibre - wise mirror map and replace the type iia theory with a type iib string compactified on @xmath5 , where points in @xmath5 corresponding to `` bad fibres '' are identified with d - branes embedded in the space . either way , f - theory promises to yield a fairly complete understanding of the entire moduli space of heterotic strings on a k3 surface .",
    "since we are able to probe the moduli space so well , we should ask where the interesting points might be . an obvious place to look",
    "is where the underlying k3 surface itself degenerates to an orbifold .",
    "this , afterall , has been where the interesting physics lives when one compactifies a type iia or iib string on a k3 surface @xcite .",
    "it turns out that a simpler question to answer concerns when the bundle data on the k3 surface degenerates .",
    "this has no analogue for the type ii string on the k3 surface .",
    "the most obvious type of degeneration of a bundle is that of the `` point - like instanton '' .",
    "that is , where the curvature of the bundle is concentrated in an infinitesimal region of the base space .",
    "the study of such objects in heterotic string theory began with witten s paper @xcite .",
    "here it was argued that for the @xmath0 heterotic string on a smooth k3 surface a point - like instanton induces massless vector multiplets enhancing the gauge symmetry by @xmath7 . factors .",
    "] this was suggested on general grounds , from the quaternionic nature of the moduli space of hypermultiplets and pictured in terms of dirichlet 5-branes from the dual type i string theory .",
    "when @xmath8 point - like instantons coalesce at the same point in the k3 surface it was argued that the gauge symmetry is enhanced by @xmath9 .    in the context of point - like instantons ,",
    "the @xmath10 heterotic string appears , at first sight , to be a quite different animal . from duality to m - theory @xcite , it was argued in @xcite that point - like instantons induce peculiar `` tensionless strings '' and new moduli in tensor supermultiplets which allow one to move off in a new direction in moduli space corresponding to a new massless tensor multiplet in the theory .",
    "this is far from the end of the story for point - like instantons however .",
    "what if the underlying k3 surface is singular and a point - like instanton sits right at the singularity ?",
    "this may well provide new behaviour .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give an example of such an instanton in the context of the @xmath0 heterotic string and explore some of its rich properties .",
    "there are two approaches to nonperturbative analysis of the heterotic string by duality .",
    "one method , which we use here , is f - theory , which may be viewed as finding a type ii dual .",
    "the rival method is that of using duality to the type i string , in particular by using orientifold methods @xcite .",
    "one should note that one may directly relate these two approaches to each other of course @xcite .",
    "the orientifold approach has proven very powerful in its ability to find explicit spectra for given models  see , for example , @xcite .",
    "indeed , the subject of massless tensors associated to the @xmath0 heterotic string was analyzed in this context in @xcite .",
    "we wish to attempt to completely classify heterotic string theories on a k3 surface which contain the original ten - dimensional @xmath0 as part of their unbroken gauge symmetry .",
    "this will lead us to the new instanton .",
    "in general one should expect the f - theory approach to give a much better coverage of the moduli space of theories than the orientifold approach .",
    "this is because the orientifold approach necessarily focuses on points in the moduli space corresponding the theories which are the global quotient of some other theory .",
    "one may also probe an infinitesimal region around this point by `` twisted marginal operators '' .",
    "f - theory on the other hand phrases questions in terms of elliptic fibrations . since any smooth deformation of an elliptic",
    "threefold is also an elliptic threefold one might at first think one can probe the entire moduli space of a given theory . while this is almost true , current understanding of f - theory only treats enhanced gauge symmetry from the point of view of degenerate fibres .",
    "there is another potential contribution from the `` mordell - weil group '' .",
    "this arises when the fibration has an infinite number of sections .",
    "we will ignore this latter possibility .",
    "it is not clear whether or not orientifold techniques could reproduce the results in this paper but it would be an interesting question to answer .",
    "we will present the classical geometry of this new instanton in section [ s : bun ] and relate it to the `` generalized second stiefel - whitney class '' as introduced by berkooz , leigh , polchinski , schwarz , seiberg , and witten @xcite .",
    "this will allow us to build our new `` hidden obstructer '' point - like instanton in section [ s : ghol ] which has nonzero generalized second stiefel - whitney class but manages to not break any of the primordeal @xmath0 gauge group .    in section [ s : f ] we build the f - theory picture of the new instanton which allows us to determine its nonperturabtive physics .",
    "the main result is the appearance of an @xmath11 enhanced gauge symmetry and a massless tensor . in section [ s : eq ]",
    "the f - theory picture is tied to known results about the @xmath10 heterotic string and to the gimon - polchinski models .    in section",
    "[ s : ph ] we show how to transform our new instantons into witten s simple instantons and _ vice versa_. this will also show that four simple instantons coaleced at an orbifold point in the k3 surface induce a massless tensor .    in section [ s : co ]",
    "we tackle the question of what happens when the two types of instantons hit each other .",
    "large spectra of gauge symmetries and hypermultiplets appear .",
    "finally we include an appendix which reviews some properties of elliptic threefolds that we require .",
    "let us review the notion of a _ generalized second stiefel - whitney class _ following the work of berkooz et al @xcite . consider a smooth @xmath12-bundle , @xmath13 , on a smooth k3 surface , @xmath14 .",
    "how can we express the topology of this bundle ? consider a 2-sphere , @xmath15 , within @xmath14 with a curve , @xmath16 , around its equator . an element , @xmath17 , of the holonomy of @xmath13 may be found by parallel transport around this curve .",
    "view @xmath15 as the union of its northern hemisphere , @xmath18 , with its southern hemisphere , @xmath19 . from the curvature , @xmath20 , of @xmath13",
    "we may then determine @xmath21 thus @xmath22 for some integer , @xmath23 .",
    "thus @xmath24 appears as an element of @xmath25 .",
    "this quantity will depend on the topology of @xmath13 but it may be that different values of @xmath23 specify the same topological class . to see how this works , consider the transition functions around @xmath16 from the northern hemisphere to the southern hemisphere as a map from @xmath16 into @xmath12 . in order that @xmath13 be homotopically nontrivial we require that the image of @xmath16 lie in a nontrivial element of @xmath26 .",
    "we may apply this construction to every homology 2-cycle within @xmath14 .",
    "we arrive at the result that a natural topological invariant of a @xmath12-bundle on @xmath14 is given by a homomorphism from @xmath27 to @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath28 is trivial then the universal coefficients theorem @xcite says that this group of homomorphisms is isomorphic to @xmath29 .",
    "there are two very familiar examples of this invariant .",
    "first if @xmath13 is the principle bundle of a holomorphic vector bundle then @xmath30 , for some @xmath31 . since @xmath32",
    "we have our invariant is simply an element of @xmath25 .",
    "this is the _ first chern class _ , @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath13 is the principle bundle of a real vector bundle then @xmath34 .",
    "since @xmath35 we have an object in @xmath36 .",
    "this is the _ second stiefel - whitney class _ , @xmath37 .",
    "we are interested in the case @xmath38 .",
    "clearly @xmath39 and so we are in a situation analogous to the second stiefel - whitney class .",
    "following @xcite we denote this @xmath40 and consider it to be a `` generalized second stiefel - whitney class '' .",
    "it will be convenient to represent @xmath41 as a 2-cycle rather than a 2-cocycle .",
    "dual to @xmath25 is @xmath27 in the usual way",
    ". we may then take @xmath27 to be dual to itself by poincar duality .",
    "thus we may take the dual of the dual of an element of @xmath36 as an element of @xmath42 .",
    "when seen this way , @xmath41 , as an element of @xmath43 , may be viewed as @xmath44 where `` @xmath45 '' represents the intersection number .",
    "we will simply use a dot to represent this natural inner product in @xmath27 from now on",
    ".    we will be particularly interested in the case where the k3 surface , @xmath14 , is a _",
    "kummer surface_. that is , when it has been obtained as the blow - up of the orbifold @xmath46 in the usual way .",
    "the kummer surface gives a natural set of elements in @xmath27 .",
    "these are    1 .   the image of the six 2-cycles in the @xmath47 under the quotient map .",
    "the sixteen 2-spheres that appear as the exceptional divisors under blowing up .",
    "although these 22 elements may be used as a basis for @xmath48 , they are not correctly normalized to form a basis for @xmath27 .",
    "that is , they generate only a finite - index sublattice of @xmath27 .",
    "this sublattice is called the _",
    "kummer lattice_. @xmath27 is even self - dual , whereas the matrix of inner products on the generators of the kummer lattice has determinant not equal to one .",
    "let us use @xmath49 , to denote the sixteen exceptional divisors .",
    "since @xmath50 by the usual arguments ( see , for example , @xcite ) , then @xmath51 can not be an element of @xmath27 for any integer , @xmath52 .",
    "having said that , certain sums of @xmath53 will be multiples of elements in @xmath27 .",
    "this partially accounts for why @xmath54 are not good generators for @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath55 where @xmath56 is either 0 or 1 .",
    "one may then show that @xmath57 will be _ twice _ an element of @xmath25 if the following is true .",
    "the 16 exceptional divisors come from the 16 fixed points of the @xmath58 action on @xmath47 .",
    "the latter sixteen points naturally form the vertices of a hypercube .",
    "consider every two - dimensional face of the hypercube .",
    "each such face will contain four @xmath59 s and thus can be associated with four @xmath56 s .",
    "the sum of these four @xmath56 s must be an even number .",
    "a simple solution is to set all @xmath56 to zero , which is trivial , or to set all @xmath56 to one .",
    "the other possibilities correspond to having eight @xmath56 s equal to zero and eight @xmath56 s equal to one in suitable combinations .    in section 4.1 of @xcite a picture of an instanton with @xmath60",
    "was given locally for an open neighbourhood of one of the exceptional divisors .",
    "this was given in terms of the curvature of the bundle which could be given compact support near the exceptional divisor .",
    "one may try to treat a @xmath0-bundle as if it were a @xmath61-bundle simply by viewing the transition functions as elements of @xmath61 rather than @xmath0 . as such we may try to build a bundle in the vector representation .",
    "let the curvature of this resulting bundle be @xmath62 .",
    "one may then show that @xmath63 for some integer , @xmath23 .",
    "thus @xmath41 can violate the quantization condition ( [ eq : c1 ] ) and obstruct the existence of a vector representation  just as @xmath64 obstructs a spin structure .",
    "if @xmath59 is the exceptional divisor in question then the instanton of @xcite satisfies @xmath65 and thus obstructs a vector structure over @xmath59 .",
    "we will call this instanton a `` @xmath59-obstructer '' .",
    "a @xmath59-obstructer can be seen to satisfy @xmath66 .",
    "since the curvature of a @xmath59-obstructer is meant to arise from local geometry , @xmath41 should be proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "since @xmath50 , we have @xmath67    now let us fit the local @xmath59-obstructer picture into the global geometry of the k3 surface , @xmath14 .",
    "it is clear that a single obstructer is not a valid configuration since @xmath41 does not lie in integral homology .",
    "we may consider a situation where we place a single obstructer over more than one exceptional divisor . now",
    ", if our set of exceptional divisors satisfies the kummer lattice condition above then we are in business .",
    "the solution considered in @xcite was to put an obstructer at all sixteen sites and so @xmath68 which is in integral homology .",
    "when considering a compactification of a heterotic string on a bundle , @xmath69 , an important piece of information about @xmath13 is its _ global holonomy _ , @xmath70 .",
    "let @xmath71 be the `` primordial '' gauge group , i.e. , @xmath10 or @xmath0 , of the heterotic string in ten dimensions .",
    "when compactified on @xmath13 , this will be broken to the _ centralizer _ of @xmath72 .",
    "that is , any element of @xmath71 which commutes with all of @xmath70 will remain a symmetry after compactification .",
    "there are two contributions to the global holonomy group , @xmath70 .",
    "firstly there is the local holonomy generated by the curvature of @xmath13 .",
    "secondly there is the contribution from non - contractable loops from @xmath73 of the base space of @xmath13",
    ".    we will be most interested in the case where the global holonomy group is trivial and thus all of the primordial gauge symmetry remains in the lower - dimensional compactified theory .",
    "we need to make both the local holonomy and the contribution from @xmath74 trivial .    we know from the work of @xcite how to make the local holonomy trivial .",
    "since this comes from the curvature of the bundle , we need to squeeze all of the region of the nonzero curvature into points over the base space .",
    "this limit is called `` point - like instantons '' . of course , we havent really justified that the paths which happen to exactly pass through the point where a small instanton lives do nt pick up holonomy but the evidence is considerable @xcite that string theory really does allow one to ignore such paths .",
    "once we have shrunken all instantons down to zero size , we need only worry about non - contractable loops breaking the gauge group . actually we should consider loops that are non - contractable _ after _ the points within @xmath75 where the point - like instantons live have been removed since we are required to ignore paths which pass through such points .",
    "let us consider the case where @xmath75 is a k3 surface .",
    "since a k3 surface is simply connected , we need only worry about non - contractable loops produced by removing the locations of point - like instantons .",
    "if the instanton happens to sit at a smooth point inside the k3 surface then the open neighbourhood of the instanton , minus the point where it sits , may be retracted onto @xmath76  which is simply connected .",
    "thus , a point - like instanton at a smooth point in a k3 surface breaks non of the primordial gauge group . for the @xmath0 heterotic string ,",
    "such point - like instantons are precisely the ones discovered by witten @xcite .",
    "we will denote such point - like instantons `` simple '' .    in the case that the k3 surface is a kummer surface at an orbifold limit",
    ", we have a singularity locally of the form @xmath77 .",
    "if the instanton happens to be sat right on this singular point , then the neighbourhood retracts onto the lens space @xmath78 .",
    "since @xmath79 equals @xmath58 we now have the possibility that the point - like instanton breaks part of the primordial gauge symmetry .",
    "as shown in @xcite this breaking of the gauge symmetry by @xmath74 effects is intimately connected to @xmath41 of the instanton .",
    "let us review this fact .",
    "consider blowing up the orbifold slightly so that we have an exception 2-sphere , @xmath59 , in a small open neighbourhood of the k3 surface .",
    "we may also put the lens space @xmath78 in this open neighbourhood , surrounding the 2-sphere .",
    "we show this in figure [ fig : lens ] .",
    "now , the lens space , @xmath80 , may be viewed as an @xmath81-bundle over the 2-sphere , @xmath59 .",
    "we may then use the leray spectral sequence ( see example 15.15 in @xcite ) to write the cohomology of @xmath80 in terms of that of @xmath59 .",
    "the important point is that there is an isomorphism @xmath82 this maps the topological class of bundles over @xmath59 as measured by @xmath41 into the class of bundles over @xmath80 given by @xmath83 .",
    "the generator of @xmath84 may be associated to the generator of @xmath85 .",
    "this follows from the universal coefficients theorem @xcite and the fact that @xmath86 is pure torsion .",
    "let us call this latter generator , @xmath16 .",
    "we show @xmath16 as a non - contractable loop in figure [ fig : lens ] .",
    "if @xmath66 then the bundle is nontrivial . the only way the bundle on @xmath80 may be nontrivial is if the holonomy element generated by @xmath16 is nontrivial .",
    "thus the global holonomy of the instanton is precisely measured by @xmath41 .    as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath58 subgroup of @xmath0 generated by @xmath16 is unique , up to endomorphisms .",
    "it is not the central @xmath58 in @xmath0 and actually breaks the primordial gauge group down to @xmath87 .",
    "that is , _ a point - like instanton in the form of a @xmath59-obstructer breaks @xmath0 to @xmath87 .",
    "_    this is nt what we want however .",
    "we want to see if we can leave the entire @xmath0 unbroken .",
    "there is a very simple way of producing a bundle with @xmath60 and yet keeping the primordial @xmath0 intact .",
    "consider the case where @xmath88 now we have @xmath89 .",
    "that is , the bundle over @xmath59 , and hence @xmath80 , is now topologically trivial .",
    "the holonomy around @xmath16 will be trivial and so @xmath0 remains unbroken when @xmath59 is blown down to a point .",
    "let us call this the hidden-@xmath59-obstructer .",
    "at first sight it looks like we have constructed something rather trivial but consider the case where we have precisely one curve , @xmath59 , in the k3 surface over which we put the hidden obstructer .",
    "then as @xmath59 is not twice an element of @xmath36 we really do have a nontrivial value for @xmath41 .",
    "following our discussion of the kummer lattice in the previous section , the situation for hidden obstructers is somewhat the opposite as for the previously discussed non - hidden obstructers :    * non - hidden obstructers must appear in multiples of eight so that the associated curves add up to twice an element of the picard lattice . *",
    "hidden obstructers must _ not _ appear in such multiples of eight since they would then form a trivial bundle .",
    "let us recap the trick we have used here to find an instanton with nontrivial @xmath41 which manages to keep the entire @xmath0 unbroken .",
    "take , say , one exceptional @xmath90 , call it @xmath59 , and set @xmath91 .",
    "this value of @xmath41 is trivial is far as @xmath59 is concerned since the self - intersection of @xmath59 is even .",
    "there will be another curve @xmath92 dual to @xmath59 , for which @xmath93 and so @xmath41 is nontrivial over this curve .",
    "now go to the limit where we blow down @xmath59 .",
    "we may put the support of the curvature near @xmath59 as shown in @xcite and so the curvature becomes zero everywhere except inside the point - like instanton .",
    "thus , all that matters for global holonomy are the non - contractable loops around the lens space surrounding @xmath59 .",
    "as we have shown , this is trivial .",
    "it is important to notice that @xmath92 is _ not _ blown down during this process and so does not build a lens space which would pick up global holonomy .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that a single obstructing instanton locally contributes one to the second chern class of the bundle . to build our hidden obstructer we essentially double the value of @xmath62 in ( [ eq : s32 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath94 goes as the square of the curvature , we see that we multiply the second chern class by four .",
    "that is , _ the hidden obstructer contributes four to the second chern class_.    we thus know the two possibilities for producing compactifications of the @xmath0 heterotic string which preserve the @xmath0 gauge symmetry :    1 .",
    "point - like instantons at smooth points in the k3 surface which have instanton number ( i.e. , contribution to @xmath94 ) one and @xmath95 .",
    "point - like instantons stuck at orbifold points in the k3 surface which have instanton number four and @xmath60 .",
    "to understand nonperturbatively how string theory behaves on our new instantons we need to find a dual picture .",
    "this is provided by f - theory .",
    "recall that f - theory associates a  threefold , @xmath3 , to a heterotic string on a k3 surface @xcite . for f - theory to work",
    ", @xmath3 must be in the form of an elliptic fibration @xmath4 .",
    "one may regard the heterotic string on the k3 surface as dual to either the type iib string on @xmath5 with some d - brane insertions or , alternatively , to some special large radius limit of the type iia string on @xmath3 .",
    "either way , the non - perturbative physics of the heterotic string becomes encoded in the elliptic fibration , @xmath4 .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "in particular , we will use the notation from @xcite and assume a knowledge of many of the results in section 6 of that paper .",
    "we would like to completely classify all heterotic string compactifications on a k3 surface which lead to a gauge symmetry containing @xmath0 in the perturbatively - understood part of the gauge symmetry .",
    "the only assumption we will make ( subject to a few caveats outlined in @xcite ) is that none of this gauge symmetry arises from the mordell - weil group .",
    "# 1*f*_#1 # 1^*_#1 we wish to understand theories which at least begin as a perturbatively - understood heterotic string theory .",
    "we thus want to begin with one tensor multiplet and , as such , we assume @xmath5 is of the form of a hirzebruch surface @xmath96 .",
    "the hirzebruch surface is a @xmath97-bundle over @xmath98 with a natural zero section , @xmath99",
    ". we will denote the class of the fibre , @xmath100 .",
    "we will call such fibres , `` @xmath100-curves '' , to avoid any confusion with the fibres of @xmath3 as an elliptic fibration . to obtain an @xmath101 term in the gauge algebra we require a line of @xmath102 fibres in @xmath5 . to make this @xmath101 part of the perturbatively - understood symmetry we put it along a section of @xmath96 .",
    "let us assume it is the zero section , @xmath99 .",
    "we may do this without loss of generality so long as we do _ not _ impose @xmath103 .    to make the group precisely @xmath0 , it was shown in @xcite that one required @xmath3 to have precisely two global sections , as an elliptic fibration .",
    "this forces a factorization of the weierstrass form of the elliptic fibration : @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are functions over @xmath96 and @xmath107 is the discriminant .",
    "the @xmath102 condition forces @xmath108 to vanish to order @xmath109 along @xmath99 .",
    "denote @xmath110 one may then show that @xmath111 must vanish to order 8 along @xmath99 and @xmath112 vanishes to order 2 .",
    "let us use upper case letters to denote the divisors in @xmath96 associated to the various functions above .",
    "the condition imposes @xmath113 let us split off from @xmath114 and @xmath115 the parts giving the @xmath102 along @xmath99 : @xmath116 with @xmath117 defined similarly .",
    "now , to make sure that the fibres along @xmath99 are generically nothing worse than @xmath102 , neither @xmath118 nor @xmath119 should contain any more of @xmath99 .",
    "this means that the intersection numbers @xmath120 must be nonnegative .",
    "thus @xmath121 .",
    "let us treat the remainder of the discriminant , given by @xmath118 and @xmath119 in turn .",
    "@xmath118 is simply @xmath122 copies of @xmath100 .",
    "generically this will mean it is @xmath122 parallel lines along the @xmath100 direction .",
    "as @xmath123 contains @xmath124 , this will produce lines of @xmath125 fibres .",
    "thus , the gauge symmetry is enhanced nonperturbatively by @xmath122 @xmath7 terms .",
    "these are precisely witten s simple point - like instantons of @xcite .",
    "if @xmath8 of these instantons are brought together , @xmath8 lines of @xmath125 will merge to form a line of @xmath126 .",
    "as explained in @xcite , monodromy turns the @xmath127 gauge algebra one might first associate to this into an @xmath9 gauge algebra .",
    "one can potentially have monodromy whenever a curve in the discriminant , whose associated gauge algebra may admit nontrivial outer automorphisms , collides with another component of the discriminant .",
    "whether or not there is monodromy can be determined purely in terms of the local geometry of the collision , and with what type of curve it collided . in our case",
    "we have a transverse collision of a line of @xmath102 fibres with a line of @xmath126 fibres .",
    "one may show that such a collision induces no monodromy in the @xmath102 fibre but has a @xmath58 action in the @xmath126 fibre .",

    "this causes the khler cone to contract , relative to that of @xmath96 , but nothing has changed topologically .",
    "this equivalence between hirzebruch surfaces is used to show the equivalence of the @xmath201 model and the @xmath202 model as in @xcite .",

    "the jumping khler cone of the hirzebruch surface is transfered to the threefold whose khler cone also shrinks over this special sub - family .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that jumping khler cones could only happen in smooth threefolds if the algebraic class that jumped into existence for special values of the complex structure was an `` elliptic scroll '' .",
    "that is , an elliptic curve times a rational curve .",
    "thus , this rational curve is a @xmath205-curve within the threefold . within the base of an elliptic fibration",
    "therefore , the only curve which is allowed to jump into existence is a @xmath193-curve , which would come from the hirzebruch surface @xmath203 . we appear to have shown that the only equivalence allowed between models is the @xmath201 to @xmath202 equivalence .",
    "we may obtain the rest of the equivalences by relaxing the constraint that the elliptic threefold be smooth .",

    "we are studying the  threefold has a curve of @xmath206-type singularities inducing the @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "it is certainly singular .    given this equivalence between  threefolds , there is no contradiction between @xmath41 equivalence classes and f - theory equivalence classes",
    ".    now let us turn our attention to the connection between the hidden obstructer theories we have described into terms of f - theory and other models in the same @xmath41 class which break at least part of @xmath0 .",
    "we focus on the gimon - polchinski models of @xcite .",
    "as explained in @xcite , we expect these models to all be in the f - theory class with @xmath201 .    to see this simply deform @xmath112 of ( [ eq : m1m2 ] ) so that it no longer vanishes along @xmath99 .",
