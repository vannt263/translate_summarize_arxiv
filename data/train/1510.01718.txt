    "the random - field ising model ( rfim ) is a paradigmatic model for describing the effect of quenched disorded on the critical behavior of systems belonging to a variety of fields,@xcite from physics and physical chemistry to econophysics .",
    "it is also notorious for being one example where perturbation theory , _",
    "i.e. _ , an expansion around a gaussian reference theory and the associated perturbative renormalization group , appears to fail completely .",
    "indeed , perturbation theory predicts to all orders that the critical behavior of the rfim in dimension @xmath2 is identical to that of the pure ising model in dimension @xmath3 , a property known as dimensional reduction.@xcite however , the result is wrong in low dimensions , as rigorously shown for @xmath4.@xcite    we found an explanation for this dimensional reduction breakdown by means of the nonperturbative functional renormalization group ( np - frg).@xcite within the np - frg , the breakdown of dimensional reduction , and the associated spontaneous breaking of an underlying supersymmetry,@xcite are attributed to the appearance of a strong enough nonanalytic dependence , a `` cusp '' , in the dimensionless renormalized cumulants of the random field at the fixed point .",
    "the np - frg predicts that such a cusp is present at the zero - temperature fixed point that controls the critical behavior of the model@xcite when the spatial dimension is lower than a nontrivial critical value , @xmath5 , whereas only weaker non - analyticities appear when @xmath6 . in consequence",
    ", dimensional reduction is broken below @xmath7 but is valid above.@xcite ( we recall that the upper critical dimension of the rfim is @xmath0 . )    inspired by the related problem of an interface in a random environment,@xcite we also related this cuspy dependence of the cumulants and correlation functions to the presence of `` avalanches '' , which are collective phenomena present in disordered systems at zero temperature.@xcite in equilibrium , such `` static '' avalanches describe the discontinuous change in the ground state of the system at values of the external source that are sample - dependent .",
    "avalanches take place on all scales at the critical point , but whether or not they induce a cusp in the _ dimensionless _ renormalized cumulants of the random field at the fixed point depends on their scaling properties , and more specifically on the fractal dimension @xmath8 of the largest typical avalanches at criticality compared to the scaling dimension of the total magnetization.@xcite the difference between these two dimensions correspond to a new exponent @xmath9 that determines whether cuspy perturbations are irrelevant ( @xmath10 ) around the cuspless fixed point ( see also below).@xcite the computation of @xmath9 via the np - frg shows that indeed @xmath10 in the rfim for @xmath6.@xcite    in this paper , we come back to the perturbation theory and show how to take into account the effect of the avalanches within its framework . of course this is possible only so long as the cuspless fixed point exists , which basically means above @xmath7 . in a nutshell ,",
