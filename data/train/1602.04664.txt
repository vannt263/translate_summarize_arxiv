    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce a rheological characterization of a peculiar class of models generalizing with infinite discrete spectra of retardation and relaxation times the classical maxwell body .",
    "the corresponding creep and relaxation memory functions are expressed in laplace domain as suitable ratios of modified bessel functions of contiguous order @xmath0 . in time domain these functions are shown to be expressed by dirichlet series ( that is infinite prony series ) so that the corresponding creep compliance and relaxation modulus turn out to be monotonic functions .",
    "these functions are characterized by infinite discrete spectra of characteristic times related to the zeros of bessel functions of the first kind .",
    "the plan of paper is as following . in section 2",
    "we revisit the essential notions of the linear theory of uni - axial viscoelasticity .",
    "the survey will be carried out by adopting the representations of the basic stress - strain relations in the laplace transform domain , as it is common in linear viscoelasticity .",
    "in particular , we will outline the role of the so - called memory functions to characterize the rate of creep and relaxation by using the mathematical notions of completely monotonic functions .    after this introductory discussion , in section 3 we analyse a general class of fluid - like models ( depending on a parameter @xmath2 ) that provides an interesting generalization of the classical maxwell model . for this purpose",
    "we provide the expressions of the laplace transforms of the memory functions as ratios between of two modified bessel functions of contiguous orders .",
    "the memory functions are then shown to be complete monotonic functions of time , expressed in terms of dirichlet series . finally , by a suitable time integration , we derive the corresponding creep compliance and the relaxation modulus ( the so - called material functions ) , so providing a full characterization of the whole class of our viscoelastic models . due to the relation of these viscoelastic models with the bessel functions ,",
    "we agree to refer them to as _ bessel models_.    in section 4 , for the bessel models we compute the asymptotic representations of the memory functions and of the corresponding material functions for short and long times .",
    "we show some instructive plots of the numerical results in order to outline the time range of validity of the asymptotic representations .",
    "we observe that the creep and relaxation properties of our models are consistent with those of a standard maxwell model for large times . on the other hand , these models are compatible with a fractional maxwell model of order 1/2 , for short times .    finally , in section 5 we complete the paper with concluding remarks and hints for future research .",
    "according to the linear theory , a viscoelastic body can be considered as a linear system with the stress ( or strain ) as the excitation function ( input ) and the strain ( or stress ) as the response function ( output ) . in this respect , the response functions to an excitation expressed by the heaviside step function @xmath3 are known to play a fundamental role both from a mathematical and physical point of view .",
    "we denote by @xmath4 the strain response to the unit step of stress , according to the _ creep test _ and by @xmath5 the stress response to a unit step of strain , according to the _ relaxation test_.    the functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 are usually referred to as the _ creep compliance _ and _ relaxation modulus _ respectively , or , simply , the _ material functions _ of the viscoelastic body . in view of the causality requirement",
    ", both functions are vanishing for @xmath8 .",
    "the limiting values of the material functions for @xmath9 and @xmath10 are related to the instantaneous ( or glass ) and equilibrium behaviours of the viscoelastic body , respectively . as a consequence , it is usual to denote @xmath11 the _ glass compliance _",
    ", @xmath12 the _ equilibrium compliance _ , and @xmath13 the _ glass modulus _ @xmath14 the _ equilibrium modulus_. as a matter of fact , both the material functions are non  negative with @xmath15 _ non decreasing _ and @xmath7 _ non increasing_.    denoting by @xmath16 and @xmath17 the uniaxial stress and strain , respectively , and under the hypotheses of sufficiently well behaved causal histories , in most cases the constitutive equations can be written in the following forms @xmath18 being of convolution type , equations ( [ stress - strain ] ) can be conveniently treated by the technique of laplace transforms so they read in the laplace domain @xmath19 from which we derive the _ reciprocity relation _ @xmath20 due to limiting theorems for the laplace transform , we deduce that @xmath21 with the convention that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are reciprocal to each other . the causal functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 are referred as the _ rate of creep ( compliance ) _ and the _ rate of relaxation ( modulus ) _ , respectively ; they play the role of _ memory functions _ in the constitutive equations ( [ stress - strain ] ) .",
    "assuming @xmath26 and @xmath27 , that is restricting our attention to viscoelastic models exhibiting instantaneous elasticity it is convenient to consider the memory functions scaled with their corresponding initial values : @xmath28 these functions are here required to be completely monotonic ( cm ) functions , that is they are non  negative , non - increasing functions for @xmath29 with infinitely many derivatives alternating in sign . as outlined by several authors ,",
    "see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , the condition of completely monotonicity is sufficient for the physical acceptability and realizability of the models since it ensures , for instance , that in isolated systems the energy decays monotonically as expected from physical considerations . for mathematical details on cm functions",
    "we refer the interested reader to the excellent treatise @xcite",

    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] because of the reciprocity relations ( [ reciprocity ] ) and the above equations , the laplace transforms of the memory functions are interrelated as follows @xmath31    according to their behaviour for large times the viscoelastic models can be considered solid - like ( finite creep and relaxation ) and fluid - like ( infinite creep and complete relaxation ) , see e.g. @xcite . as a consequence for fluid - like",
    "models we have @xmath32 we note the the simplest model of this type is the classical maxwell body characterized by a single time constant @xmath33 @xmath34 more generally , the fluid - like models exhibit continuous ( or discrete ) time spectra that we write as @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "it is worth to remark that we can recover the memory functions for the maxwell model by setting in eqs .",
    "( [ time - spectra ] ) : @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the dirac generalized function .",
    "physically , the mathematical representations ( [ time - spectra ] ) imply that any processes in linear viscoelasticity can be generally considered as a continuous ( or discrete ) superposition of elementary ( that is exponential ) relaxation processes .",
    "in this section we discuss a generalization of the fluid - like model proposed by giusti and mainardi in @xcite based on modified bessel functions of order @xmath41 in the laplace domain . indeed , turning to modified bessel functions of contiguous order @xmath2",
    ", we propose a suitable generalization of the memory functions related to the rate of creep and relaxation in the laplace domain .",
    "consequently , by inversion , we compute both memory functions and the corresponding material functions in the time domain for this class of viscoelastic models that we have agreed to call _ bessel models_.      consider a linear viscoelastic model characterized by a _ rate of creep function _",
    "@xmath42 defined , in the laplace domain , as @xmath43 now , the laplace transform of the corresponding _ rate of relaxation function _",
    "@xmath44 is related to @xmath45 as follows @xmath46 as it is required by the general relation ( [ psi - phi ] ) between the two memory functions .",
    "taking into account the recurrence relations for the modified bessel functions of the first kind @xmath47 , @xmath48 we immediately get the expression for the laplace transform of the _ _ relaxation memory function _ _",
    "@xmath49 , @xmath50    let us first focus on the laplace transform of the _ rate of creep _",
    "@xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_lt_psi ] ) .",
    "we can obtain the rate of creep in the time domain by inverting the laplace transform @xmath51 . to do this we apply the bromwich theorem , @xmath52 where with @xmath53 we denote the so called bromwich contour .",
    "now , it is easy to see from the power series of modified bessel functions of the first kind : @xmath54 that the function @xmath51 is single valued and has a simple pole in @xmath55 .",
    "indeed @xmath56 where we have made use also of the known property of the gamma function @xmath57 .",
    "furthermore , it is straightforward to see that @xmath51 has infinite simple poles in @xmath58 , where @xmath59 represents the @xmath60th positive real root of the bessel functions of the corresponding order @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath63 having renamed @xmath64 with @xmath65 and recalled the known relation @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , the non - vanishing simple poles for the laplace transform of the rate of creep are given by @xmath67    now , we can safely compute the bromwich integral ( [ bromwich ] ) by means of the residues theorem , @xmath68 where @xmath69 , for @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "thus , we have to distinguish two cases : + if @xmath72 , then @xmath73 this result is obtained after a few passages hereafter outlined .",
    "@xmath74 above we have used the property that if @xmath75 is a zero of the modified bessel function @xmath76 , then we have , @xmath77 as we deduce from the general identity for modified bessel functions , see e.g. @xcite , @xmath78 otherwise , if @xmath79 , in view of eq.([eq_s_zero ] ) @xmath80 hence , the memory function is given by @xmath81 where @xmath59 is the @xmath60th positive real zero of @xmath82 and @xmath29 is the time .    as a consequence , it can be easily noticed that the time representation of the rate of creep @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ dirichlet_2 ] ) is a _",
    "dirichlet series_. in particular , the series in eq . ( [ dirichlet_2 ] ) is absolutely convergent for @xmath29 .",
    "however , we omit the details of this proof that can be easily deduced following the procedures displayed in @xcite and @xcite .    proceeding in strict analogy with the above discussion",
    ", one can easily find an explicit form for the relaxation memory function @xmath49 .",
    "indeed , we find that @xmath83 which is a dirichlet series absolutely convergent for @xmath29 , where @xmath84 is the @xmath60th positive real zero of @xmath85 analogously with the discussion above for @xmath42 .",
