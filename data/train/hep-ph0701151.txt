    "among the remaining unknowns in neutrino physics , resolving the neutrino mass hierarchy may be one of the key importance to our understanding of physics of neutrino masses and the lepton flavor mixing @xcite . given the significance of the problem , it is natural that many methods are proposed for determining the mass hierarchy .",
    "the most conventional one would be to do neutrino and antineutrino comparison in long - baseline ( lbl ) accelerator based oscillation experiments @xcite . because of the difference in how the matter effect interferes with the vacuum oscillation effect it can signal the sign of @xmath3 , and hence the mass hierarchy .",
    "other less conventional ideas include the methods using atmospheric neutrinos @xcite , @xmath4 and @xmath5 disappearance channels @xcite , supernova neutrinos @xcite , and neutrino - less double beta decay @xcite .",
    "these lists of references can not be complete , and some of the other relevant references are quoted therein .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss yet another way of determining the neutrino mass hierarchy by a neutrino oscillation disappearance experiment using _ a single neutrino flavor _ in vacuum whereas in previous works  @xcite the method required the use of two different disappearance channels close to the first oscillation maximum .",
    "the possibility that the neutrino survival probability in vacuum can be sensitive to the neutrino mass hierarchy was first suggested in @xcite using reactor neutrinos in the context of high-@xmath6 large mixing angle ( lma ) solar neutrino solution .",
    "it was also pursued recently in the hanohano project using a fourier transform technique @xcite .",
    "we present here a complete formulation and physics understanding of the new method to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "this method utilizes the feature that the atmospheric-@xmath7 scale oscillation `` interferes '' with the solar-@xmath7 scale oscillation in a different way depending upon the mass hierarchy .",
    "we first carefully re - formulate the difference as an advancement or retardation of the phase of the atmospheric - scale neutrino oscillation relative to the solar - scale oscillation ; for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 disappearance probabilities , the atmospheric oscillation is continuously advanced ( retarded ) for the normal ( inverted ) hierarchy .",
    "since the core of the problem exists in extracting long wavelength solar oscillation out of the two short wavelength atmospheric scale oscillations due to @xmath10 and @xmath3 , it is the critical matter to identify which quantity to be held fixed in defining the mass hierarchy reversal from the normal to the inverted , or vice versa . to our understanding , the only known appropriate quantity to hold is the effective neutrino mass squared difference @xmath11 ( see eq.([eqn : dmsqee ] ) ) , the one which is actually observed in @xmath4 ( or @xmath0 ) disappearance measurement at the first few oscillation maxima and/or minima @xcite .",
    "we find it important to have the proper formalism because otherwise the sensitivity to the mass hierarchy resolution can be significantly overestimated .",
    "then , we point out that an experiment using the resonant @xmath0 absorption reaction @xcite enhanced by mssbauer effect recently proposed by raghavan @xcite gives the first concrete realization of the idea .",
    "( see @xcite for earlier proposals of mssbauer enhanced experiments . )",
    "because of the monochromaticity of the @xmath0 beam from the bound state beta decay @xcite , the phase advancement or retardation of atmospheric - scale neutrino oscillation is detectable after 20 or more oscillations if the source and the target are made sufficiently compact in size .",
    "the unique feature of this method is the use of this ultra - monochromatic neutrino source thereby sidestepping the very high energy resolution requirement requested with reactor or accelerator neutrinos .    a concrete plan for the experiment may be as follows ; in the first stage the atmospheric @xmath11 must be accurately measured in a way described in @xcite by a measurement at @xmath1210 m baseline .",
    "as we will see , the precision of the measurement must reach sub - percent level in order for this method to work .",
    "then , in the second stage relative phase advancement or retardation of the atmospheric - scale neutrino oscillation must be detected by moving the detector to @xmath12350 m , this is just beyond the solar - scale oscillation distance for 18.6 kev neutrinos .",
    "based on this plan we give a detailed estimate of the sensitivity to the resolution of the mass hierarchy .    upon finishing the above measurement",
    ", it is natural to think about the continuation of the experiment by moving the detector to distances tuned for precision measurement of the oscillation parameters relevant for solar neutrinos , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we also give a detailed estimate of the accuracy for the determination of these parameters .",
    "it is notable that a resonant @xmath13 absorption experiment could allow to make precise measurements of _ all mixing parameters _ that appear in the @xmath14 oscillation channel : @xmath15 , @xmath2 , @xmath1 , the effective atmospheric @xmath16 and the neutrino mass hierarchy .    in sec .",

    "( [ pee ] ) , we have beating because the frequency of the two waves in ( [ pee ] ) with @xmath30 and @xmath31 differ by the frequency associated with the @xmath34 characterized by the solar @xmath1 scale , which is smaller by a factor of @xmath35 compared to the atmospheric @xmath36 scale .",
    "one can decompose the superposed waves into the beating low frequency wave and the high frequency wiggles within the beat . here ,",
    "unlike the case addressed in most textbooks of basic physics , the amplitude of the two frequencies is different .",
    "therefore , to tell which of the high frequencies has a larger amplitude , one has to determine whether the phase of the high frequency wiggles advances or retards as the wave evolves .",

    "<S> the neutrino mass hierarchy can be determined , in principle , by measuring a phase in the disappearance oscillation probability in vacuum , without relying on the matter effect , using a single channel . </S>",
    "<S> this phase is not the same for the normal and inverted neutrino mass spectra . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we give a complete description and physics understanding of the method . </S>",
    "<S> the key feature of the method is to detect advancement ( normal ) or retardation ( inverted ) of the phase of the atmospheric - scale oscillation relative to the solar - scale oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that this method can be realized with the recently proposed resonant @xmath0 absorption reaction enhanced by mssbauer effect . </S>",
    "<S> the unique feature of this setup is the ultra - monochromaticity of the observed @xmath0 s . because of this feature the phase advancement or retardation of atmospheric - scale neutrino oscillation is detectable after 20 or more oscillations if the source and the target are made sufficiently compact in size . </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative estimate of the sensitivity to mass hierarchy resolution is given . </S>",
    "<S> we have also examined how a possible continuation of such experiment can be carried out in order also to achieve high precision ( few % ) determination of the solar - scale oscillation parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    </S>",
