    "both of the cdf and ddetectors , are undergoing major upgrades in run ii , which will start in march , 2001 . the tevatron will deliver approximately 2 fb@xmath2 integrated luminosity to each experiment , a factor of 20 more than the run i data samples .",
    "this will provide a unique opportunity for both experiments to search for the higgs boson in the mass range of 110 to 200 gev until new lhc data arrives . at the same time",
    ", a wide range of other physics topics will be present . among",
    "these we expect to study various rare decays of @xmath1 mesons , search for cp violation and @xmath3 oscillations . in this note",
    "we discuss various aspects of standard model ( sm ) higgs production and @xmath1 physics in run ii .",
    "details of the ddetector can be found elsewhere @xcite . here",
    ", we briefly summarize the main features of the detector relevant for higgs and @xmath1 physics .",
    "the heart of the ddetector is a silicon tracking system ( smt ) , which consists of six barrel segments with a disks in between and three more disks located at each end of the tracker .",
    "the barrel and disks are based on 50 @xmath4 pitch silicon microstrip detectors , providing spatial resolution @xmath5 . at each end of this system",
    "the two large disks are placed in order to increase @xmath6 coverage .",
    "the smt system is enclosed in fiber tracker ( cft ) .",
    "they represent a complete robust tracking system of the detector .",
    "ddetector will allow us to have momentum resolution at the level of @xmath7 for low @xmath8 tracks with quite high tracking efficiency for charged particles at @xmath9 .",
    "vertex reconstruction resolution is expected to be @xmath10 in ( @xmath11 ) plane for primary vertices and for secondary vertices it is expected to be @xmath12 in the ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath13 in the @xmath14 planes , respectively . a major upgrade of the muon system together with central and forward scintillators will allow us to trigger charged tracks .",
    "electron and muon identification will be possible in the central and forward regions .",
    "the cdf detector has similar capabilities such as a new silicon and central outer trackers , plug calorimeter , muon chambers , and data acquisition system .",
    "owing an additional silicon layer near the beam pipe , a time of flight system , they are expect to have slightly better vertex reconstruction resolution @xcite .",
    "in the standard model , higgs bosons are expected to be produced in gluon fusion or in conjunction with a @xmath15 or @xmath16 boson .",
    "the expected cross sections at the tevatron are shown in fig .",
    "[ higgs_cs ] @xcite .",
    "although the gluon fusion mode is expected to be largest contributor to higgs boson production , it will be overwhelmed by the huge qcd background .",
    "therefore pay most attention to the @xmath17 and @xmath18 production modes .",
    "the higgs boson will mainly decay into @xmath19 and @xmath20 final states for the mass range below and above 135 gev , as shown in fig .",
    "[ higgs_br ] @xcite .",
    "in the low mass range , @xmath21 gev , in 90% of the cases the higgs will decay into a @xmath19 pair giving a @xmath22 final state where the leptonic decay of the @xmath15 or @xmath16 will serve as a trigger .",
    "the high-@xmath8 lepton ( @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) trigger is expected to use in selection of @xmath25 mode where @xmath26 .",
    "we assume that such a trigger will be efficient for leptons with @xmath27 gev .",
    "also a large amount of missing transverse energy @xmath28 gev is expected .",
    "two @xmath29-tagged central jets are expected to survive in the `` loose '' and `` tight '' selection cuts . the main background for this mode will be @xmath30 and @xmath31 decays . for the @xmath32 final state",
    "the selection criteria are based on missing transverse energy from the escaping neutrinos and two distinct @xmath29-jets . here",
    "the main backgrounds come from @xmath33 and @xmath34 events . for the @xmath35 final state , the trigger threshold for final leptons",
    "could be reduced to @xmath36 gev .",
    "the invariant mass of two outgoing leptons should be consistent with @xmath16 boson mass .",
    "two separate @xmath29-jets are also required in this case .",
    "the main background will come from real @xmath16 s produced in conjunction with @xmath19 pairs , or from @xmath15 s decaying hadronically .",
    "finally , for the @xmath37 case , the expected background from qcd events is expected to be unreduceable .",
    "the cross sections of di - jet and four - jet events are expected to be of the order of @xmath38 and @xmath39 pb , respectively .    for the mass range , @xmath40 gev , where the higgs boson produced in conjunction with a vector bosons",
    ", it will mainly decay into @xmath41 states denotes a @xmath42 boson of either on- or off - mass - shell . ] with subsequent decay @xmath43 .",
    "for this case selection criteria requires two leptons with @xmath36 gev having the same charge and two separate jets with @xmath44 gev and at least @xmath45 gev @xmath46 .",
    "the main background in this case is @xmath47 production .",
    "also it is possible to consider tri - lepton final states produced in @xmath48 chain .",
    "the main attraction of this case is a small background .",
    "one could find the best combination of trileptons and fit their invariant masses to be consistent with @xmath49 and @xmath50 final states .",
    "nevertheless we do not expect much to gain from this channel due to its small branching fraction .",
    "in the case of gluon fusion production of the higgs boson the four possible combinations are allowed : @xmath51 for the @xmath52 channel we expect to have a large background from @xmath20 , @xmath31 , @xmath34 , and @xmath53 production .",
    "it can be reduced requiring two leptons with @xmath36 gev and @xmath6 constrain .",
    "one could possible use a transverse and a `` cluster mass '' mass constrains and perform likelihood analysis , see @xcite .",
    "the rest of the two final states can be considered using proper cut for outgoing leptons and requiring two distinct jets .    among various analyses underway in both collaborations ,",
    "the most promising ones are based on a neural networks technique .",
    "various sets of kinematic variables is used to discriminate signal from background . among them",
    "are transverse momentum of the isolated lepton , its pseudorapidity , the missing transverse energy of the event , the invariant mass of the final @xmath19-pair , and the separation between the @xmath29-tagged jets , the lepton and the first @xmath29-tagged jet , and between the lepton and the second @xmath29-tagged jet .",
    "one of the important tasks is to find the best possible @xmath29-tagging efficiency and mass resolution which are expected to be at the level of 55 - 60% and 10% , respectively .",
    "it looks like that it will be impossible to choose a golden channel , and that success in a higgs search will require a combination of all possible channels .",
    "the details of various techniques as well as latest results for higgs search can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and/or under web @xcite . as a result of preliminary analyses ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ higgs_exp ] the integrated luminosity delivered per experiment which would be required to either exclude the sm higgs at the level of 95% or to make a discovery at the @xmath54 and @xmath55 levels .",
    "the wide bands in the plot represent the calculated threshold plus uncertainties in the @xmath29-tagging efficiency , background rate , mass resolution , and other effects .",
    "as the plot shows , in order to cover the full possible spectrum of higgs mass allowed at tevatron energies , the total integrated luminosity should be extended up to 30 fb@xmath2 per experiment . even though a combination of all channels as well as the data from both experiments are needed , new approaches and robust reconstruction algorithms",
    "will also be required .",
    "the weak decays of @xmath56 and @xmath57 mesons play crucial roles in the study of cp violation effects both within and beyond the standard model .",
    "the ckm @xcite matrix elements , determined from various @xmath1 decay channels , can be represented in the wolfenstein parameterization @xcite as a set of four parameters @xmath58 .",
    "the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 are known with good accuracy @xcite : @xmath61 the @xmath62 and @xmath63 parameters can be extracted mostly from four processes : cp violation in the neutral kaon system , oscillations of @xmath64 and @xmath65 mesons , and charmless semileptonic @xmath29 decays .",
    "the last three of these are the subject of great interest in the run ii @xmath1 physics program .",
    "the expected luminosity of the tevatron , @xmath66 @xmath67s@xmath2 , in run ii will lead to a huge rate of @xmath19 production , @xmath68 events / year .",
    "this enormous statistics will allow us to study various @xmath1 decays modes , search for cp violation and @xmath3 mixing .",
    "primary interest will focus on the study of cp - violation , and related constraints on @xmath69 from @xmath57 mixing .",
    "oscillations in @xmath1 system occurs because of high - order corrections , as shown in fig .",
    "[ bb ] .",
    "the light and mass eigenstates , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , are different from the cp eigenstates @xmath72 and @xmath73 : @xmath74 unlike the kaon system , the mass difference @xmath75 is the key feature of the physics",
    ". many analyses of @xmath76 oscillations have been performed by several collaborations and their results have been combined to give @xcite : @xmath77 . for the case of @xmath65 mesons , due to their large mass difference @xmath78 , the @xmath65 oscillation frequency",
    "is thought to be much higher then the well measured @xmath64 one .",
    "existing data , mostly from cern experiments , exclude small values of the mixing parameter @xmath79 , @xmath80 at the 95% cl @xcite .",
    "various decay modes of @xmath65 mesons are under investigation by the dcollaboration . among them",
    "@xmath81 the final data sample will be determine by the quality of the track and secondary vertex reconstruction algorithms .",
    "final states of @xmath1 s are expected to be fully reconstructed and tagged by the charge of the lepton and reconstructed charm meson and/or kaon .",
    "the initial state required for a @xmath57 mixing search can be tagged in one of two possible ways , either by applying same - side tagging or opposite - side tagging techniques . using the good smt resolution",
    ", we can tag @xmath1 decays using displaced secondary vertices or tracks with large impact parameters . for a 10% @xmath1 reconstruction efficiency and with 12% of @xmath57 having @xmath82 gev and @xmath83 for all final state particles ,",
    "we expect approximately 2500 reconstructed events . we will be sensitive for @xmath84 .",
    "a new limit for @xmath85 can be establish using the well - known relation : @xmath86 where theoretical uncertainties are included in the quantity @xmath87 @xcite : @xmath88 the cdf detector is expected to obtain a better constrain on the @xmath79 parameter . using their time - of - flight system , @xmath89 separation at the level of @xmath90 and opposite kaon tagging , they expect to reach @xmath91 @xcite",
    ".    a second major component of the @xmath1 physics studies will be a cp violation search in @xmath1 decays .",
    "it is well known that an asymmetry in the @xmath1 system is generated if both decay amplitudes are nonzero and if the weak decay phase , @xmath92 , is different from the mixing one , @xmath93 .",
    "defining mass eigenstates as @xmath94 and @xmath95 we have the following definition of @xmath93 and @xmath92 : @xmath96 experimentally , we need to look for the asymmetry of the final state , @xmath97 : @xmath98 and try to measure the quantity @xmath99 . here",
    "the dilution factor @xmath100 is defined via the correct tag probability @xmath101 and together with efficiency @xmath102 defines the tag s effectiveness , @xmath103 ; where the mixing factor @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the uncertainties on @xmath106 : @xmath107,\\ ] ] are defined as @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the number of reconstructed events .",
    "the three major blocks in @xmath106 comes from @xmath110 mixing , @xmath111 , final decay fraction @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 mixing , @xmath115 .",
    "flavor tagging efficiency will play a crucial role in final purity of the samples .",
    "we have summarized it in table [ flavortag ] .",
    ".[flavortag ] flavor tagging efficiencies for both cdf and ddetectors based on knowledge from run i and mc studies @xcite .",
    "[ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     all numbers are based on our knowledge from run i and mc studies . as can be seen from the table our tag effectiveness will not exceed 10% .",
    "the golden mode is expected to be the decay of @xmath116 which is quite easy to trigger when @xmath117 .",
    "the following cuts can be applied in this case : @xmath118 gev for muon tracks , @xmath119 gev and @xmath120 . we expect to have approximately 40000 @xmath121 and 20000 @xmath122 events with statistical errors dominating the systematics . for the time - independent analysis ,",
    "assuming 2 fb@xmath2 integrated luminosity , @xmath123 , and a tag effectiveness @xmath124 , our expectation leads to @xmath125 for the case of @xmath126 and @xmath127 for the @xmath128 channel . with 20 fb@xmath2",
    "we will go down to @xmath129 .",
    "such precision , together with other measurements , will tune the position of the unitary triangle in the @xmath130 plane and help us better understand the sm parameters .    among other possibilities a large area of @xmath1 physics",
    "can be covered in run ii : individual hadron masses and lifetimes ( @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath57 , @xmath133 ) search for @xmath134 meson ( @xmath135 ) search for rare b - decays ( @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 ) , and a non - sm cp violation search via the @xmath140 channel , but they are out of topic of this discussion .",
    "as we have shown , the forthcoming run ii at the tevatron collider is expected to give us a unique opportunity to study various exciting aspects of the sm , such as higgs search and cp violation .",
    "thanks to the huge effort from many people , the dand cdf detectors are on the final road and ready to start collecting data in march 2001 .",
    "the main improvements in run ii that make us optimistic for the physics are based on increased integrated luminosity , at least factor of 20x more then in run i , and major upgrades of both detectors . for both goals , higgs search and @xmath1 physics , the main gains will come from @xmath29 identification and from the @xmath19 invariant mass measurement .",
    "now our focus is concentrated on building a robust , reliable reconstruction algorithm , in order to fully explore the detector capabilities .",
    "preliminary studies by the higgs search working group show that there is no golden channel in the analysis , and in order to be successful , we need to combine all data and all decay modes from both experiments .",
    "initial luminosity of the tevatron , 2 fb@xmath2 , will allow us to explore higgs mass at the level of lep2 , but with 10 fb@xmath2 , we will be able to exclude at 95% c.l .",
    "an sm higgs up to @xmath141 gev and with 20 fb@xmath2 we could see its evidence at the level of 3@xmath142 .",
    "dand cdf will significantly contribute to @xmath1 physics in run ii .",
    "the main focus of our attention will be the @xmath57 oscillation search and cp violation .",
    "several different modes are under investigation .",
    "we expect to improve the lower limit on the @xmath79 parameter up to a level of 20 ( d ) and 60 ( cdf ) and extend our knowledge about the unitary triangle by measuring @xmath106 with an accuracy of 0.01 - 0.05 .",
