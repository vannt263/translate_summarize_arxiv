    "heart is a remarkably reliable machine whose function is to pump the blood as required by the organism .",
    "an important part of its work is the orderly propagation of electrical signal , that is the wave of excitation passing through cardiac muscle , which subsequently triggers its ordered contraction .",
    "abnormalities of the excitation wave propagation , known as arrhythmias , are precursors of sudden cardiac arrest and other life - threatening pathologies .",
    "this paper focuses on mathematical analysis of arrhythmogenic conditions associated with cardiac tissue recovery from acute ischemia , also known as _",
    "reperfusion arrhythmias_. such recovery can be more dangerous then ischemia itself and often leads to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death  @xcite .",
    "reperfusion can be spontaneous ( relief of coronary spasm , dislodging of a thrombus ) or externally imposed ( antithrombolitic therapy , angioplasty ) .",
    "it can also occur on a microscopic scale during ischemia itself as a result in shifts in microcirculation  @xcite . as of today",
    ", the exact mechanisms of reperfusion arrhythmias remain poorly understood .",
    "this is because the inner layers of ischaemic boundary are inaccessible for live visualization on a spatial scale required to distinguish behaviour of individual cells .",
    "therefore , in order to understand how the abnormal activity spreads from single cells to the bulk of cardiac tissue , we and others had to rely on either _ in vitro _  experimental preparations or on computer modeling .",
    "our work builds on the experimental data acquired from monolayers of cardiac myocytes under conditions that mimicked the ischaemic boundary  @xcite , and the results of direct numerical simulations that closely matched these experimental observations  @xcite .",
    "the _ in silico _ modelling provided an explanation to several experimental findings , including the dependence of drift of boundary - bound spirals on their chirality , pin - drift - pin type of spiral tip motion and the effect of boundary movement on spiral detachment  @xcite .",
    "the rotating waves of activity to be discussed in this paper , occur on a much smaller spatial scale as compared to classical cardiac reentry  @xcite , see  figure  [ microscopic ] .",
    "specifically , we are focusing on a dynamically and spatially changing set of conditions which can occur within a thin layer of cells sandwiched between intact healthy tissue and the recovering ischaemic areas .",
    "myocytes within such layers can become spontaneously active as a result of calcium overload and/or local noradrenaline release .",
    "the impact of intrinsic myocyte heterogeneity on network behaviour is markedly enhanced due to decrease in electrical coupling between the cells .",
    "it gets even more complicated as the physicochemical factors that create the boundary , such as low ph , lack of oxygen , hyperkalemia , noradrenaline , move in space due to the dynamic nature of reperfusion . altogether",
    "the moving boundary , heterogeneous substrate , steep gradient of coupling and self - oscillatory activity of individual cells can give rise to a rich network behaviour discussed in our previous paper  @xcite .",
    "a continuous generation of mini - reentries from individual ectopic sources occurs within the least coupled cells layers , and then the activity spreads towards the better coupled layers of the boundary  [ 8 ] .",
    "this scenario was suggested by our experiments in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and was later supported and expanded upon using the _ in silico _  approach . yet , numerical modelling of cellular behaviour has its limitations , and there is a need to understand how much of the phenomena observed in the simulations are generic and how much of it depends on the specifics of the model . further still , cardiac tissue is three - dimensional , whereas our experiments and simulations reported previously were conducted using two - dimensional cell networks .",
    "extrapolation of the two dimensional data into three dimensions requires additional theoretical understanding .    in the present paper ,",
    "we use an asymptotic theory of spiral and scroll waves drift together with the recently developed numerical technique to compute the response functions of spiral waves @xcite to provide theoretical analysis of our experimental and numerical data .",
    "we then use this theoretical framework to predict behaviour of the scroll waves in an ischaemic border zone in 3d , where such experiments are not currently feasible .",
    "finally we confirm theoretical 3d predictions by numerical simulations of cell network behaviour .",
    "specifically , we address the following questions :    1 .   in both experiments and numerical simulations ,",
    "spiral waves were not static within the border zone .",
    "what determines the components of the drift velocity , and why the spiral cores can be dragged together with the moving border zone ? 2 .",
    "in both experiments and numerical simulations , the drift of the spirals was interrupted by their `` pinning '' to clusters of cells .",
    "we have shown numerically that these can be cell clusters of either elevated or suppressed excitability .",
    "what is the mechanism of such pinning ? 3 .",
    "in both experiments and numerical simulations , the episodes of spiral drift and pinning alternated . what is the mechanism by which pinning can give way to further drift ?",
    "one of arrhythmogenic scenarios proposed in  @xcite involved pinning of a spiral wave to a local heterogeneity which persists long enough until the border zone passes and the spiral gets into the better coupled tissue .",
    "is this scenario viable in 3d ?",
    "the mathematical model mimicking the conditions when tissue recoveres from acute ischaemia , and its experimental foundations are described in detail in our previous works  @xcite and references therein . to capture the complexity of pathophysiological conditions associated with reperfusion arrhythmias",
    ", we use a simplified kinetic model of individual cells , and enrich it by adding individual cell heterogeneity , different course of recovery of cell coupling and excitability , and spatial arrangement of conditions on the boundary of ischemic tissue . the importance of the latter three factors , cell heterogeneity , individual cell excitability and cell - to - cell coupling , for the cardiac network behaviour was studied in our previous paper  @xcite .",
    "the arguments and experimental evidence presented there suggest that from the network / tissue perspective , it is not very important exactly how these properties are altered . in this paper , we model a tissue recovering from acute ischaemia as a three - layered slab made of a heterogeneous mix of cells , subject to a vertical gradient of average cell excitability and a vertical gradient of cell - to - cell coupling strength .",
    "the 2d and 3d versions of the model are illustrated in  figure  [ schematic ] . in terms of the parametric diagram described in  @xcite and shown in  figure  [ diagram ]",
    ", the bottom layer corresponds to the parametric region iv .",
    "it has low excitability and weak coupling which result in the quiescent state where propagation is not possible .",
    "the outer layer with high excitability and strong coupling is in the parametric region v of the digram , corresponding to the quiescent state where wave propagation is possible .",
    "the middle , or transitional , layer is sandwiched between inner and outer layers , so , from bottom to top , it starts in region iii ( high excitability and weak coupling resulting in spontaneous fragmented waves ) and then via a gradual increase in coupling strength proceeds to region v ( high excitability , strong coupling , quiescent state where wave propagation is possible ) characteristic of the upper layer .",
    "the layers are not static but move downwards through the slab , which represents the reperfusion , or wash - out , of the agents affecting the relevant tissue properties . depending on type of reperfusion",
    ", blood flow can recover within seconds ( cases of resolved coronary spasm , spontaneous dislodging of thrombi , angioplasty ) or within minutes ( cases of changes in coronary flow due to gradual accumulation of metabolites or pharmacological interventions ) .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of moving border zone can vary in a rather wide range , from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "we select the values of the border zone speed that produce interesting effects .",
    "we assume that the cells are arranged in a rectangular grid of @xmath2 ( in 2d ) or @xmath3 ( in 3d ) cells connected to each other via ohmic resistances .",
    "properties of the cells and resistivities of the contacts are varied in time an space .",
    "the cells are assumed to have linear size of @xmath4 which serves as a space scale to endow the voltage diffusivity and other space - related quantities with suitable dimensionality .",
    "the cells are connected to the nearest neighbours , so an internal cell has four contacts in 2d and six contacts in 3d .",
    "the excitable dynamics of cells is described by the beeler - reuter - pumir  @xcite ( brp ) model of a neonatal cardiac myocyte .",
    "the brp model is based on the generic beeler - reuter  @xcite model of a cardiac myocyte , which contains an explicit , albeit simplified , description of individual ionic currents , and was slightly modified to match the ionic currents reported for neonatal cardiac cells used in our experiments  @xcite .",
    "the complete set of the brp model equations is given the appendix ; here we only outline the modifications .",
    "the affected equations are @xmath5 , \\nonumber\\\\        { i_{ext}}&= & \\nabla\\left ( { d}(z , t ) \\nabla { v}\\right ) .",
    "{ \\label{eq : brp}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last equation in  ( [ eq : brp ] ) is written , for brevity , as the continuous limit , whereas actual calculations of the inter - cellular currents were discrete , as described in more details in the appendix .",
    "the coupling strength between the cells is represented by the voltage diffusion coefficient @xmath6 , and some of the values of @xmath7 we use here are too low to hold the continuous limit of the ( [ eq : brp ] ) . note that as far as the continuous limit is concerned , the voltage diffusivity @xmath7 is the only quantity in the model related to space , so while within this limit , all results are easily rescaled from one value of @xmath7 to another .",
    "the maximum permeability of the fast inward current @xmath8 is 60% of the standard ( 2.4 vs 4 ) , and that of the slow inward current , @xmath9 , is 50% of the standard ( 0.045 vs 0.09 ) .",
    "we also have altered the balance between inward and outward currents by inhibiting the inward potassium rectifier current , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "suppression of @xmath10 to @xmath11 of the standard value mimics its smaller contribution reported for neonatal cardiomyocytes  @xcite as compared to the original beeler and reuter values for adult ventricular cells  @xcite .",
    "we use this supressed value of @xmath10 ( @xmath12 ) for the bottom layer of the ischemic slab . in the upper layers ,",
    "further suppression , represented by the factor @xmath13 , @xmath14 , enhances excitability . for high enough values of @xmath15 ,",
    "this leads to spontaneous firing of individual cells ,  makes them automatic  @xcite . in  @xcite we considered @xmath15 values that led to the _ in silico _",
    "network behaviour closely matching the behaviour of neonatal cardiomyocyte layers .",
    "the excitability of the latter cells was increased using beta - adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol  @xcite and ischaemia - reperfusion protocol  @xcite .",
    "compared to  @xcite , here we only consider a narrow range of values of @xmath15 , where phenomena interesting for our present study are observed . in our previous paper",
    "@xcite , parameter @xmath16 varied in space and time and it was essential that it covered both excitable and automatic regimes , so it was called both `` automaticity '' and `` excitability '' . here",
    "we concentrate mostly on the events happening in the excitable regime ( @xmath17 , within the range of intermediate coupling values , or region v in the parametric space , shown in  figure  [ diagram ] ) , hence for brevity we mostly refer to parameter @xmath15 as `` excitability parameter '' or simply `` excitability ''",
    ". it should be kept in mind , however , that due to the above ambiguity , this usage may differ from the meaning of `` excitability parameter '' in other studies .",
    "heterogeneity of individual cells excitability is described as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the gaussian distributed uncorrelated random variable with unit dispersion , and parameter @xmath20 represents the intensity of heterogeneity .",
    "space - time variations of @xmath7 and @xmath21 are defined as @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the coordinate across the boundary , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the limits of the steepest part of the coupling gradient , @xmath27 is the diffusion coefficient in the upper , well - coupled layer , @xmath28 corresponds to the bottom , uncoupled layer , and @xmath29 is the highest level of excitability within the slab .",
    "we used the boundary width @xmath30 in all simulations .",
    "parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 vary linearly in time , @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the recovering ischaemic tissue is modelled as layers with imposed excitability and coupling profiles as shown in  figure  [ schematic ] .",
    "specifically , we are modelling experimental conditions when previously severely uncoupled ischaemic areas are reperfused with agents which elevate cell excitability",
    ".    finally , we also made simulations with deliberately arranged parametric distributions not exploiting random number generators .",
    "the details of those are given where the results are described .",
    "the asymptotic theory of spiral and scroll dynamics under small perturbations  @xcite is formulated for the `` reaction - diffusion '' system of partial differential equations ( pdes ) , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a column - vector of the reagent concentrations , @xmath37 is a column - vector of the reaction rates , @xmath38 is the matrix of diffusion coefficients , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 or @xmath41 ) is the vector of coordinates , and @xmath42 is some small perturbation of the right - hand side , @xmath43 . for the beeler - reuter - pumir model , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 $ ] , @xmath47 and @xmath48 otherwise .",
    "the theory assumes that spiral wave solutions to equations  ( [ eq : rds ] ) for @xmath40 are stationary rotating , not meandering .",
    "this is indeed satisfied for brp model for all @xmath15 values considered .",
    "mathematically , the assumption means that a spiral wave solution to ( [ eq : rds ] ) for @xmath40 in the @xmath49-plane has particular dependence on space and time , so it rotates around a center of rotation @xmath50 with angular velocity @xmath51 and fiducial phase @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 are polar coordinates centered at @xmath55 .",
    "a spiral wave can of course rotate in either direction ; we assume @xmath56 for clockwise rotation .    in presence of a small perturbation , @xmath57",
    ", a spiral wave preserves the pattern , only slowly changing its frequency and location of the core .",
    "it actually behaves as a localised object , only sensitive to perturbations affecting its core .",
    "the localised sensitivity to perturbations is mathematically expressed in terms of the spiral wave s response functions , that is the critical eigenfunctions of the adjoint linearised operator , which are essentially nonzero only in the vicinity of the core and exponentially decay with distance from it .",
    "knowledge of the response functions allows quantitatively accurate prediction of spiral waves drift due to small perturbations of any nature , which makes the response functions a property that is as fundamental for spiral waves as mass is for matter . in particular , the @xmath55-drift velocity ,  the velocity of the drift of the position of the core of the spiral , is defined , in the first order in @xmath58 , by an integral of the perturbation @xmath59 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the complex coordinate of the instant spiral centre , inner product @xmath62 stands for the scalar product in functional space , @xmath63 function @xmath64 is perturbation @xmath59 of the right - hand side in ( [ eq : rds ] ) , re - written in the @xmath55-centered corotating frame of reference @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the polar angle in the corotating frame of reference , and @xmath67 is the time measured in terms of the spiral rotational phase .",
    "the kernel @xmath68 of this integral is the ( translational ) response function which characterizes the unperturbed spiral wave solution ( [ eq : sw ] ) and can be calculated numerically together with it .",
    "given the dependence of the perturbation @xmath64 on the current position of the spiral @xmath69 , equation  ( [ eq : forces - trans ] ) is a closed system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) for the coordinates of the instant centre of rotation of the spiral wave .",
    "a more detailed exposition of the theory and description of the method of calculating the response functions are given in  @xcite .",
    "in the present study we use the same method with the modifications relevant to the brp model , which has @xmath70 as opposed to simplified @xmath71 models considered in  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ rf ] shows density plots for the spiral wave , @xmath72 , and its response functions , @xmath73 , in brp model for @xmath74 ; for other values of @xmath15 the plots look qualitatively similar .",
    "the important property is that all components of the response functions are large only in the core of the spiral and quickly decay beyond it .",
    "scroll waves are three - dimensional analogues of spiral waves .",
    "they rotate around curves called _ filaments _ , as spiral waves rotate around points called centres . in general ,",
    "scroll filaments are not fixed in space but move , typically on a slow timescale relative to the rotation period .",
    "hence , in addition to whatever dynamics 2d spiral waves might have , scroll waves exhibit additional dynamics associated with filament motion  @xcite .",
    "working in frenet coordinates , the motion may be conveniently expressed in terms of the velocities @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the normal and binormal directions , respectively , at each point along the filament .",
    "motion along the tangential direction is of no physical significance and is equivalent to reparametrization of the filament .",
    "then , the motion equation for the filament , in the assumption of small filament curvature , @xmath77 , and slowly varying phase , has the form  @xcite @xmath78 where omitted are terms representing effects of the perturbations of the right - hand sides , if any ( which may be of the same order as that shown ) , and higher - order terms . the complex coefficient @xmath79 in the equation  ( [ eq : fil - motion ] ) is calculated using the same response functions as for the underlying spiral wave , as @xmath80 and the positive sign of @xmath81 means movement towards the local centre of curvature .",
    "following @xcite , some publications use the notation @xmath82 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the real component @xmath83 has special importance : if @xmath84 , the overall length of the filament becomes shorter with time , and if @xmath85 , the filament lengthens with time , as long as the asymptotic description remains valid .",
    "hence this coefficient is sometimes called _ filament tension _ of the scroll wave .",
    "the coefficient @xmath86 is the _ binormal drift coefficient _ and describes the drift of a scroll ring filament perpendicular to the plane of the ring , or more generally , the velocity component orthogonal to the local plane of the filament .

    "we shall now use the superposition principle to analyse the 2d drift of a spiral wave subject to a combination of forces caused by a smooth gradient of diffusivity , a smooth gradient of the excitability parameter @xmath15 and a localised inhomogeneity in parameter @xmath15 . in a system of reference with the origin at the centre of the disk inhomogeneity , @xmath153 , the equation of motion for a complex coordinate of spiral wave rotation centre @xmath69 is @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the force induced by the localised inhomogeneity and @xmath156 is the constant dragging force due to the smooth gradient of parameter @xmath15 and/or the diffusivity gradient .",
    "we use polar coordinates for the instant centre position , @xmath157 , and also set @xmath158 where @xmath159 and @xmath160 are the magnitude and direction of the gradient force .",
    "further , we separate the radial and azimuthal components of force @xmath155 , @xmath161 .",
    "then , the equations of motion in the two real dynamic variables are @xmath162 an equilibrium in the system ( [ eq : pin - grad-2 ] ) may be observed at a radius @xmath150 satisfying @xmath163 it is easy to see that equilibria will not exist , that is , the smooth gradient force will definitely tear a spiral off from the localized inhomogeneity , if @xmath164 that is , if the gradient force exceeds the maximal force of interaction with inhomogeneity , including both radial and azimuthal components ( see also @xcite where a special case with @xmath165 was considered ) .        following ( [ eq : equil ] ) , for every @xmath166 there are at least two equilibria at different values of @xmath150 .",
    "note that @xmath166 can happen at either sign of @xmath167 ,  both for attracting and repelling inhomogeneities .",
    "standard calculations give that an equilibrium at a distance @xmath168 from the inhomogeneity will be stable in linear approximation if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied simultaneously : @xmath169 the stability conditions ( [ eq : stability ] ) can be easily checked graphically , and the graphs of the two functions involved are shown in figure  [ pin - g ] .",
    "these conditions require that both functions should be increasing at @xmath170 . the first inequality does not depend on the sign of @xmath171 , and it therefore demands that @xmath168 is smaller than the position of the maximum of @xmath172 ( the blue dashed curves ) . for the second inequality",
    "the situation is more complicated as it depends on the sign of @xmath171 . for the case",
    "@xmath152 ,  repelling inhomogeneity with excitability higher than @xmath134 , the second stability condition demands that the position of the equilibrium is to the right of the minimum of @xmath173 , which is shown by the solid red curve . for both values of @xmath134 shown in figure  [ pin - g ] , and also for all @xmath134 in between , as we have checked ,",
    "this is incompatible with the first condition , as the red minimum always happens to the right of the blue maximum . for @xmath151 ,  attracting inhomogeneity with excitability lower than @xmath134 around it , the second stability condition demands that the position of the equilibrium should be to the left of the red minimum , which is a requirement that is weaker than the first condition , as all points to the left of the blue maximum are also to the left of the red minimum .",
    "so , in our model there can not be a stable equilibrium near a repelling inhomogeneity , but only near an attractive inhomogeneity .",
    "intriguingly , if the relative position of the two extrema was different ,  the red minimum was to the left of the blue maximum , it would create a paradoxical possibility of a stable equilibrium occuring due to interaction with a repelling inhomogeneity .",
    "we are not aware of any reasons why this could not happen in some models , but it does not happen in our present model in the range of parameters that we are interested in .        thus , these theoretical predictions based on the response functions of the vortices suggest that stable pinning of a spiral wave in our model may be to lowered - excitability sites only , while in the experimental and simulations described in @xcite the pinning to inhomogeneities of either sign was observed .",
    "we have a closer look at this seeming contradiction below .",
    "firstly , the pinning observed in experiments and simulations was not permanent but temporary .",
    "an explanation for that could be that the pinning persisted only until the gradient force exceeded the tear - off threshold ( [ eq : tear - thresh ] ) .",
    "however , it is also possible that the pinning was temporary because it was really a slow - down near an unstable equilibrium in the vicinity of a repelling inhomogeneity .",
    "panel ( a ) in figure  [ pin - unpin ] reproduces the tip trajectory in a ` pinning' event from @xcite , revealing that it was actually only a temporary stall between two fast - drift episodes .",
    "panel ( b ) illustrates that this sort of stalling is easily reproduced in deliberately arranged simulations and is well described by the ode model  ( [ eq : pin - grad ] ) .",
    "secondly , a certain mutual allocation of repelling heterogeneities may cause ` permanent ' pinning , again until the parameters change .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ pin - unpin](c ) .",
    "there are two identical repelling inhomogeneities .",
    "for the given initial position of the spiral wave , if only the lower inhomogeneity was present , the drift would proceed along a trajectory similar to that in panel ( b ) .",
    "however this drift is disallowed by the presence of the upper repelling inhomogeneity , hence the spiral stops at a point of equilibrium of three forces : the constant dragging force and the two repulsion forces from the two localized repelling inhomogeneities .",
    "panel ( d ) in figure  [ pin - unpin ] is given for completeness , to illustrate the more straightforward case of pinning in the vicinity of an attracting inhomogeneity .",
    "it is worth noticing a simple phenomenological difference between pinning to a repulsive inhomogeneity and to an attractive one : for the former , the spiral wave stops _ in front _ of the inhomogeneity , and for the latter , _ behind _ it .",
    "there are several factors responsible for the quantitative discrepancies seen in figure  [ pin - unpin](b  d ) between the theoretical predictions for the trajectories of the spiral drift and the trajectories obtained from direct numerical simulations : large value of @xmath171 affecting the applicability of the asymptotic theory , the crudeness of the cell structure affecting the behaviour of the direct simulations as compared to the continuous limit , and also the finite @xmath113 used in simulations as compared to the small-@xmath113 limit assumed in the theory .",
    "however , the theoretical trajectories and those obtained from direct numerical simulations are in good qualitative agreement , so the asymptotic theory works really well for this complicated arrangement , despite all the simplifications made .    naturally , with the random distribution of heterogeneity , as present in the experiments and the numerical simulations of the ischaemic border zone , all of the above scenarios with pinning to inhomogeneities of either sign could take place from time to time . in some experiments",
    "the pinning locations subsequently became sources of ectopic waves of excitation and therefore were associated with points of higher excitability . in other experiments , the pinning locations never produced the ectopic waves , which suggested that the pinning inhomogeneity had the lowered excitability .",
    "understanding that there are different mechanisms of pinning to attractive inhomogeneity with lowered excitability and to a ( group of ) repelling inhomogeneity(s ) with elevated excitability provides an explanation for these seemingly contradicting experimental observations .",
    "the asymptotic theory of spiral and scroll drift is valid for pdes , describing continuous media",
    ". the theory might not be applicable if the discreteness of the cell structure is significant when the diffusivity is small .",
    "thus our findings here are purely empirical , based on direct numerical simulations .",
    "the role of discreteness in 2d dynamics was extensively analysed in @xcite so here we concentrate on 3d aspects .",
    "the effect of dicreteness is to a certain extent similar to that of heterogeneities ,  it can hinder the drift caused by the smooth parametric or diffusivity gradient .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ ft ] , where we present simulations of 2d curvature - induced ( electrophoretic ) drift , for different values of diffusivity at @xmath174 and positive @xmath100 . as can be seen from figure  [ alp - graphs](a ) , at @xmath174 @xmath175 ,",
    "so @xmath176 is negative which corresponds to the drift in the negative @xmath102 direction in figure  [ ft ] .    it can be seen that in figure  [ ft ] , in line with continuous limit predictions , as diffusivity decreases , so does the spatial scale of the spiral tip trajectory .",
    "further still there is another effect which has an entirely discrete nature : as diffusivity becomes too small , the drift of the spiral stops altogether .",
    "panel ( b ) indicates that there is a range of diffusivities at which the longitudinal component of the drift ( which corresponds to the filament tension @xmath142 and is smaller in absolute value than the lateral component , see figure  [ alp - graphs](a ) ) , ` freezes out ' , while the lateral component is still observed , so the drift proceeds along the vertical grid line .    note",
    "that change of filament tension due to relatively small discreteness is a generic feature of excitable media , and has been reported in fitzhugh - nagumo  @xcite and barkley  @xcite models .",
    "another important effect of the tissue discreteness is due to the role of microscopic heterogeneities of parameter @xmath15 , defined by equation  ( [ eq : heterogeneity ] ) , in the generation of ectopic foci and breakup of excitation waves . in presence of the microscopic heterogeneity , @xmath177 , a macroscopically homogeneous tissue , with @xmath178 , @xmath179 in ( [ eq : dzt ] ) and ( [ eq : alpzt ] ) , may either show spontaneous focal sources or be quiescent depending on particular combination of @xmath7 , @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "the critical curves in the @xmath180 plane , separating the automatic and exctiable regimes ( corresponding to the zones iii and v in  figure  [ diagram ] and transition between them ) , are shown in figure  [ parport ] , for 2d and 3d cases .",
    "we obtained the 3d curve from direct simulations on a thin three - dimensional grid of @xmath181 cells at @xmath182 .",
    "the transition curve obtained from 2d simulations , as in @xcite , is shown on the same graph for comparison .",
    "one can see that position of the 3d transitional curve is elevated compared to the 2d transitional curve .",
    "this elevation is due to the fact that every cell in 3d is connected to more neighbours , which increases the load on the automatic cells surrounded by non - automatic environment .",
    "therefore , in 3d it takes more automaticity to overcome the coupling with the quiescent neighbours , so in 3d simulations the same regimes are observed at different values of parameters @xmath21 and @xmath7 than in 2d simulations .",
    "we performed numerical simulations of the 3d tissue slab with diffusivity and excitability profiles shown in  figure  [ bubbles](c ) .",
    "the lower layer contained fully uncoupled cells with excitability @xmath12 .",
    "this layer corresponded to the region iv in  figure  [ diagram ] , `` a quiescent state where wave propagation is not possible '' . to reveal the above described effects of tissue discreteness , we performed simulations using three different sets of parameters @xmath7 , @xmath21 and @xmath20 defining properties of the upper layer .",
    "we used @xmath183 in all cases .",
    "the first , `` toy '' set of parameters ( figures  [ bubbles ] and [ scrolls ] ) was @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 . at the small @xmath186",
    "the number of cells getting above @xmath187 line will be small , resulting in further elevation of the 3d transitional curve compared to the @xmath182 shown in figure  [ parport ] .",
    "therefore , the upper layer with this set of parameters @xmath7 , @xmath21 and @xmath20 still corresponded to the region v `` a quiescent state where wave propagation is possible '' , which ensured a transition from what is described as region iii `` fragmented ectopic waves '' within the middle layer to region v in the top layer .",
    "the value @xmath188 was below the physiologically meaningful range , so simulations with the smaller @xmath7 were more of a mathematical excercise , which allowed however , due to the smaller spatial scales involed , to perform a relatively detailed study despite the computational expences of the three - dimensional model .",
    "the principal conclusion was then tested with the more physiologically relevant set of paramers .",
    "the two `` more realistic '' sets of parameters ( figure  [ large - d ] ) were @xmath189 , @xmath182 , with either @xmath190 or @xmath191 , both corresponded to the region v `` a quiescent state where wave propagation is possible '' ( below the critical line in  figure  [ parport ] ) , which also ensured the transition from region iii to region v within the middle layer .",
    "this sets of parameters were `` more realistic '' in terms of the value of diffusivity more relevant to physiologically meaningful range .",
    "figure  [ bubbles ] presents a simulation with the `` toy '' set of parameters in a box size @xmath192 cells and a relatively slow border speed of @xmath193 .",
    "panel ( a ) shows small ectopic sources giving rise to multiple ectopic `` bubbles '' in 3d , also shown in cross - sections from the model s cube of cells in figure  [ bubbles](b ) .",
    "the wavefronts from multiple smaller ectopic sources fused into larger wavefronts which were spreading toward the upper , better coupled layers of the border zone .",
    "no scroll wave activity is observed in the upper zone . when the transitional border zone has passed down ,",
    "the cube is left without ectopics and all activity is ceased .",
    "figure  [ bubbles](c ) illustrates the probability of the spirals escape as a function of the speed of the border in a thin 3d grid of cells .",
    "when the border moves too slow , it tends to `` drag '' the spiral waves with it , so none penetrate into the outer zone , as was the case in the simulation shown in panels ( a , b ) .",
    "when the border speed is too high , then again no spiral waves are observed in the better coupled upper layer , as they do not have enough time to develop .",
    "so , as can be seen from the far right graph in figure  [ bubbles](c ) , the escapes are possible when the transitional middle layer moves faster than a typical velocity of a spiral wave drift , but slower than the conduction velocity ( both speeds are measured for the conditions of suppressed coupling which can be found in the border zone ) . in particular , the maximal number of spirals was observed at the border speed of @xmath194 .",
    "a snapshot half way through a simulation with @xmath195 , with a few spirals that have already penetrated the outer zone , is shown on the leftmost panel .",
    "as we noted earlier , in reality the border zone speed may vary in a very broad range .",
    "simple escape into the well - coupled upper layer is not enough for the scrolls to cause fibrillation in 3d .",
    "scroll waves are typically born as `` scroll rings '' with closed filaments .",
    "as shown above , in our model , negative filament tension is predicted by the theory for the smaller values of excitability parameter @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , the effects of filament tension of either sign can be obstructed by the discrete structure of the model tissue , which is particularly essential in the conditions of the suppressed coupling .",
    "figure  [ scrolls ] presents a simulation with the `` toy '' set of parameters in a box size @xmath192 cells and a higher border speed of @xmath195 , when moving border zone led to generation of multiple scrolls which stayed in the medium after the zone was gone ( see also the supplementary video  ` fig12.mpg ` ) .",
    "figure  [ scrolls](a ) shows the top view of the 3d box at four selected instants . to a viewer",
    "this will appear as small ectopic sources developing into larger spiral waves .",
    "figure  [ scrolls](b ) reveals the underlying 3d waves as they would look on the side faces of the box .",
    "the 3d scrolls originate deep within the poorly coupled layers of the ischaemic tissue and are spreading upwards as the border zone moves downwards .",
    "figure  [ scrolls](c ) shows in transparent colors the wavefronts of these newly born scrolls .",
    "finally , figure  [ scrolls](d ) shows scroll filaments visualized as phase singularities defined as the points where simultaneously @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "the dense cloud of the singularities corresponds to the area where the microscopic heterogeneities cause multiple wavebreaks .",
    "some of them develop into fully fledged scroll waves , which do not collapse and spread through the whole network of cells to instigate persistent , self - supporting fibrillatory activity .",
    "note that at the value of @xmath15 used here , the filament tension is positive , and the scrolls in the upper layer would tend to collapse were it not for the effect of the medium discreteness which according to  figure  [ ft](c , d ) is very essential at this artificially low value of @xmath184 .",
    "this simulation shown in  figure  [ scrolls ] confirms the main conclusion based on the two - dimensional tissue culture experiments and simulations  @xcite .",
    "that is that the key factors of the ischaemic border zone , such as the gradient of coupling strength together with the microscopic heterogeneity and macroscopic gradient of excitability , generate organizing centres of sub - millimeter scale , which then penetrate into the bulk of the well coupled tissue , where the re - entry reaches macroscopic scales .",
    "this main conclusion is supported and reinforced by simulations at larger , more realistic values of @xmath7 , shown in figure  [ large - d ] ( see also the supplementary video  ` fig13.mov ` ) .",
    "stronger coupling results in stronger effective averaging of the microscopic heterogeneities .",
    "hence , for the more realistic 3d similutions , we have increased both the coupling strength @xmath7 and the microscopic heterogeneity @xmath20 . at this bigger @xmath27 value ,",
    "the filament tension is already essential , as evidenced by figure  [ ft](a ) .",
    "we have chosen two values of @xmath15 which correspond to a negative and a positive tension of the generated vortex filaments ( cf  figure  [ alp - graphs](a ) ) . the upper row in figure",
    "[ large - d ] shows results of simulations with a negative filament tension ( @xmath198 ) . in this simulation ,",
    "the scroll that penetrated the bulk of the tissue has persisted after the ischemic border zone had disappeared . on the contrast , the lower row in figure  [ large - d ] shows that for @xmath74 , when the scrolls in the upper layer had a positive filament tension , they did not persist , but moved together with the moving border zone .",
    "continuation of the simulation figure  [ large - d](b ) led to complete elimination of all activity ( not shown ) .",
    "all that is in full agreement with what could be expected from the predictions of the asymptotic theory .",
    "we have considered the quantitative predictions of the asymptotic theory for the forces acting on rotating waves of activity that can form within a recovering ischaemic border .",
    "the direct numerical simulations with deliberately arranged conditions confirmed the theoretical predictions for the evolution of the vortices .",
    "now , we can answer the specific questions posed in the introduction as follows .    1 .   _ `` in both experiments and numerical simulations , spiral waves were not static within the border zone .",
    "what determines the components of the drift velocity , and why the spiral cores can be dragged together with the moving border zone ? ''",
    "_ * the theoretical analysis of the acting forces shows that regions with suppressed excitability @xmath15 are attracting for spirals , both if applied as a smooth gradient , or as a localized heterogeneity .",
    "conversely , if the upper layer of the boundary layer has a higher excitability , it tends to repel spirals .",
    "this implies dragging the cores of the newly born re - entries by the moving transitional border zone down towards the bottom layer with the lowered excitability , and preventing them from escaping into the upper layer and ultimately into the normal tissue with higher excitability .",
    "* at the relatively low values of excitability @xmath15 in the upper layer corresponding to @xmath199 , the spirals are repelled from the transitional border layer into the better coupled upper layer with higher diffusivity .",
    "this case corresponds to the simulation with @xmath198 shown in figure  [ large - d](a ) . in this simulation ,",
    "the newly born scroll penetrated the bulk of the tissue and persisted even after the recovering border zone ceased to exist .",
    "+ at the relatively high values of excitability @xmath15 in the upper layer corresponding to @xmath200 , a gradient of diffusivity drives spiral waves towards areas of smaller diffusivity ,  towards the poor coupled bottom layer .",
    "this case corresponds to the simulation with @xmath74 shown in figure  [ large - d](b ) . in this simulation ,",
    "the newly born scroll filaments never managed to get far into the upper layer , where the positive filament tension further helped to complete their elimination .",
    "+ hence , a relatively high excitability in the upper layer will suppress the transition to fibrillatory - like state for _ two _ reasons : the gradient of excitability will prevent the cores of spirals or filaments of scrolls from escaping into the more excitable outer zone ; and at higher excitability , the gradient of coupling will also drag them away from the better coupled outer zone .",
    "`` in both experiments and numerical simulations , the drift of the spirals was interrupted by their `` pinning '' to clusters of cells .",
    "we have shown numerically that these can be cell clusters of either elevated or suppressed excitability .",
    "what is the mechanism of such pinning ? ''",
    "* the theoretical analysis shows that a combination of acting forces generated by smooth gradients of tissue properties and a localized inhomogeneity in excitability parameter @xmath15 may lead to temporary or permanent pinning of drifting spirals .",
    "the chances of pinning depend on the trajectory of the drifting spiral and geometry of the heterogeneity , and it may happen at either sign of the inhomogeneity (  locally increased or decreased excitability ) .",
    "* there is more than one mechanism of pinning .",
    "apart from pinning to an attracting inhomogeneity , the drift can also be stopped by a certain spatial arrangement of repelling inhomogeneities . even if `` permanent '' pinning is not achieved , a temporary pinning still may be observed for some finite time if the trajectory of the spiral core passes near an unstable equilibrium .",
    "there is also a theoretical possibility of `` orbital motion '' which however is not realized in the present model at interesting values of parameters .",
    "`` in both experiments and numerical simulations , the episodes of spiral drift and pinning alternated .",
    "what is the mechanism by which pinning can give way to further drift ? ''",
    "_ * correspondingly , there is more than one mechanism of unpinning .",
    "one is that due to the border zone dynamics , parameters of the tissue may change in such a way that gradient - induced force exceeds the tear - off threshold .",
    "the other is that the spiral wave core drifts away from the pinning site because its position there was unstable in the first place .",
    "`` one of arrhythmogenic scenarios proposed in  @xcite involved pinning of a spiral wave to a local heterogeneity which persists long enough until the border zone passes and the spiral gets into the better coupled tissue .",
    "is this scenario viable in 3d ? ''",
    "_ * in 3d , in addition to whatever dynamics 2d spiral waves might have , scroll waves exhibit additional dynamics associated with the motion of filament , and characterized by the _ filament tension _ and the _ binormal drift coefficient_. in the considered tissue model , the filament tension is small compared to the binormal drift coefficient , and changes sign in the relevant range of excitability parameter .",
    "this means that scroll waves that managed to escape into the well coupled upper zone , might not necessarily immediately collapse . *",
    "the scroll filaments that managed to stay until the tissue is recovered , may not collapse but survive , if the filament tension is negative .",
    "these filaments may subsequently generate scroll wave turbulence .",
    "note a nontrivial coincidence following from the asymptotic theory : excitability of the upper layer at the lower range of parameter @xmath15 ensures the negative filament tension and hence is a condition of survival of scrolls in that zone , and it also ensures that the specific force caused by the coupling gradient repells the scrolls into the upper , better coupled layer .",
    "so here we have a _",
    "third _ reason a relatively high excitability in the outer layer is `` anti - arrhythmic '' : at higher excitability , the scrolls in the outer layer are less likely to survive due to 3d effects . *",
    "further , there are some features revealed by the 2d simulations which are beyond direct applicability of the asymptotic theory .",
    "that is the effect of the dicreteness of the medium , which particularly matters at low values of diffusivity .",
    "the discretness of the medium can arrest the drift of spiral cores , and when applied to 3d scrolls , the filaments can freeze as long as their curvature is not too high , and the `` filament tension '' component of their drift freezes sooner than the `` lateral binormal drift '' component . therefore ,",
    "the scroll filaments that managed to stay until the tissue is recovered , may not collapse but survive , as their filament tension is frozen due to low diffusivity . in that case of",
    "the `` frozen '' , zero filament tension , the regime might rather look like a persistent tachycardia similar to the pinned 2d spiral regime .",
    "to summarize , we explored a biophysically plausible mechanism as to how ectopic beats and spreading scrolls of abnormal activity can be generated from the recovering boundary of acutely ischaemic tissue .",
    "complex boundary behaviour in heterogeneous cell network was modeled with certain assumptions and simplifications , extensively discussed in our previous publications  @xcite .",
    "with all the assumptions and limitations , the following combined conclusions can be made based on the _ in vitro _  and",
    "_ in silico _  data from our previous publications and the current study",
    "first , the data suggested that the combination of the two gradients (  the spatial gradient in cell - to - cell coupling and the temporal gradient in excitability / automaticity ) ensured that somewhere within the border zone there was a region where multiple ectopic sources were continuously being formed .",
    "they were highly localized focal points of activity , with activation spreading only to a few surrounding cells .",
    "number of ectopic sources and specific window of conditions when they occured were affected by the degree of the network heterogeneity .",
    "secondly , the data argued that if the ectopically active layer was sufficiently wide and/or the overall cell automaticity rose , ectopic sources developed into target - like waves . if coupling gradient and automaticity levels remained spatiotemporally fixed , the pattern of target - like sources persisted and no spiral activity was observed . however , when cell automaticity rose and/or border zone moved in space , the propagation patterns became non - stationary .",
    "this led to multiple wavebreaks resulting in spiral generation activity .",
    "the spiral waves typically demonstrated start - stop drifting behaviour , as a result of competing forces between pinning force due to local heterogeneity and a gradient - induced directional drift .",
    "the likelihood of a spiral escape into the better coupled upper tissue zone depend on the speed at which the border zone moves in space .",
    "our extrapolation of 2d events into 3d is more theoretical , as tissue culture experiments similar to those described in  @xcite are not feasible in 3d .",
    "still , this extrapolation has shown that the border zone can give rise to 3d analogues of spirals , the scroll waves .",
    "if a scroll wave escapes into a better coupled tissue it will not necessarily cause fibrillation , because the scroll wave with positive filament tension have tendency to collapse .",
    "however , our simulations have shown that this collapse of newly generated scrolls is not inevitable and , instead , scroll filaments can stabilise or , in case of negative filament tension , expand and multiply leading to a fibrillation - like state .    in this study , we considered the asymptotic theory s quantitative predictions for the forces acting on a cardiac re - entry , and causing its drift , in the vicinity of the ischaemic border zone .",
    "the theoretical predictions allow to tell apart and highlight different mechanisms of arrythmogenesis by the ischaemic boder zone in three - dimentiontional settings .",
    "the direct numerical simulations with deliberately arranged conditions confirmed the theoretical predictions for the drift .",
    "we fully realize that in vivo , the above considered scenarios will be affected by multiple additional factors .",
    "these might include excitability kinetics different from the simplified generic model we used here , presence of highly excitable purkinje fibers , macroscopic myofiber orientation , coronary vessels , fibrous or fat deposits , transmural differences in myocytes metabolic activity and their sensitivity to ischaemia . yet , with all its limitations , this study represents one of the first attempts to theoretically explore a very complex set of highly arrhythmogenic conditions that can occur on the boundary of the recovering ischaemic tissue .",

    "<S> abnormal electrical activity from the boundaries of ischemic cardiac tissue is recognized as one of the major causes in generation of ischemia - reperfusion arrhythmias . here </S>",
    "<S> we present theoretical analysis of the waves of electrical activity that can rise on the boundary of cardiac cell network upon its recovery from ischaemia - like conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the main factors included in our analysis are macroscopic gradients of the cell - to - cell coupling and cell excitability and microscopic heterogeneity of individual cells . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between these factors allows one to explain how spirals form , drift together with the moving boundary , get transiently pinned to local inhomogeneities , and finally penetrate into the bulk of the well - coupled tissue where they reach macroscopic scale . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic theory of the drift of spiral and scroll waves based on response functions provides explanation of the drifts involved in this mechanism , with the exception of effects due to the discreteness of cardiac tissue . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , this asymptotic theory allows an extrapolation of 2d events into 3d , which has shown that cells within the border zone can give rise to 3d analogues of spirals , the scroll waves . </S>",
    "<S> when and if such scroll waves escape into a better coupled tissue , they are likely to collapse due to the positive filament tension . </S>",
    "<S> however , our simulations have shown that such collapse of newly generated scrolls is not inevitable and that under certain conditions filament tension becomes negative , leading to scroll filaments to expand and multiply leading to a fibrillation - like state within small areas of cardiac tissue . </S>"
