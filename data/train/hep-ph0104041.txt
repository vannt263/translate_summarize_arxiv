    "the standard model of particle physics , described by the gauge group su(3)@xmath7su(2)@xmath7u(1 ) is one of the most successful physical theories ever . nonetheless , the standard model is theoretically unsatisfying for a number of reasons .",
    "for instance , the instability of the weak scale against radiative corrections has motivated the study of numerous theories , including technicolor , supersymmetry and theories with additional dimensions .    while the gauge hierarchy may be the most compelling motivation for new physics , there are additional reasons to consider theories with further structure .",
    "it was long ago realized that the gauge group of the standard model could be embedded into a simple group @xcite .",
    "the appeal of this idea was substantiated by measurements of electroweak observables which suggested that the values of the standard model gauge couplings unify at a scale @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "as data became increasingly precise , it became apparent that the simplest grand unified theory ( gut ) , minimal su(5 ) , predicted a value for @xmath9 that was incompatible with observation .",
    "however , the combination of supersymmetry and grand unification @xcite has met with great success in predicting @xmath9 @xcite . for these supersymmetric theories , the gut symmetry must be broken at a somewhat higher scale , @xmath10 .",
    "one smoking gun signal of grand unification is proton decay , which arises from dimension six operators generated by exchange of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 gauge bosons , and , in supersymmetric theories , from dimension five operators generated by colored higgsino exchange @xcite . in supersymmetric guts , the dimension six operators typically do not lead to observable proton decay , but the dimension five operators do , and place strong limits on these theories @xcite .",
    "recently ref .",
    "@xcite studied the dimension five proton decay and found that even large masses for the first - two generation sparticles can not save minimal supersymmetric su(5 ) .",
    "they found that successful gauge coupling unification requires that the higgs triplet mass fall in the range @xmath11 .",
    "however , even with decoupling of the superpartners , the limit from proton decay was shown to require @xmath12 .    while additional field content may generate threshold effects to rectify this , in this paper we propose an alternative possibility .",
    "we will embed a unified gauge theory into five dimensions in which gauge and higgs fields propagate in the additional dimension .",
    "we will show that if the gut is broken on a brane at a high scale ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath0 , the planck scale of the five - dimensional theory ) , the wave functions of the gauge fields and higgs triplets can develop an approximate node on the brane , suppressing proton decay operators arising from their exchange .",
    "we will show that the running above the compactification scale is not only consistent with , but is in fact equivalent to ordinary four dimensional logarithmic unification with the compactification scale identified as the mass of the higgs triplet .    in doing so , we reformulate the question of the @xmath13 hierarchy because the breaking occurs at the fundamental scale of the theory ( which , in general , is still larger than @xmath14 ) . in its place",
    "we require a somewhat large hierarchy @xmath15 between the planck and compactification scales .",
    "the traditional gut scale , @xmath16 , is a derived scale in this framework : there is no new physics there .",
    "because of the @xmath4 breaking of the grand unified group on the brane , we will also easily understand deviations from su(5 ) predicted relationships among yukawa couplings .",
    "we consider a 5d supersymmetric su(5 ) theory with the fifth dimension compactified on an @xmath17 orbifold ( in section [ sec : so(10 ) ] we will consider the possibility of larger gauge groups ) .",
    "the bulk exhibits n=1 supersymmetry in five dimensions , which translates into an n=2 supersymmetry in four dimensions .",
    "the fields that propagate in the bulk are contained in a gauge supermultiplet and two higgs hypermultiplets transforming as @xmath18 and @xmath19 under su(5 ) . under the 4d n=1 supersymmetry preserved after the orbifold compactification ,",
    "the gauge supermultiplet decomposes into a vector superfield @xmath20 and an associated chiral adjoint @xmath21 .",
    "the two hypermultiplets yield four chiral multiplets @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "( @xmath22 and @xmath25 transform as @xmath18 under the su(5 ) , while @xmath23 and @xmath24 as @xmath26 . ) under the orbifold @xmath27 , which flips the sign of the fifth coordinate ( @xmath28 ) , the various superfields transform as @xmath29 which leaves zero modes only for the mssm fields and their gut counterparts .",
    "the @xmath17 orbifold has fixed points at @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we take chiral matter to be localized to the @xmath31 fixed point , along with an adjoint chiral superfield @xmath32 .",
    "the su(5 ) symmetry is broken by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath32 , which we assume to have the form @xmath33 we imagine that this breaking occurs at or near the five - dimensional planck scale @xmath0 , which we assume to be much larger than the conventional gut scale of @xmath16 .",
    "we will refer to the @xmath31 fixed point as the gut - breaking brane .",
    "bulk fields even under the orbifold @xmath27 can couple directly to the fields on the gut - breaking brane .",
    "for instance , the higgs fields can couple to the chiral matter fields @xmath34 and @xmath35 as @xmath36 in the superpotential .",
    "we also take there to be a bare higgs mass term , @xmath37 , as well as higgs coupling to the gut breaking , @xmath38 , in the superpotential . while it would be interesting to study standard solutions to the doublet - triplet splitting problem in this framework",
    ", we will not endeavor to do so here .",
    "rather , we will simply tune these two contributions against one another so that the su(2 ) doublets @xmath39 @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xmath42 are nearly massless , while the colored triplets @xmath43 @xmath40 and @xmath44 @xmath42 end up with a large mass term @xmath45 .",
    "note that @xmath46 is a dimensionless parameter since @xmath43 and @xmath44 are bulk fields and have dimension @xmath47 .",
    "here , @xmath46 arises as a sum of terms ( with higher order terms potentially relevant in the strongly coupled theory ) .",
    "in addition to the bare mass term , the @xmath48 term contributes .",
    "the natural size of this operator is restricted only by perturbativity , with an upper bound @xmath49 suggested by naive dimensional analysis in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "once the gauge symmetry is broken , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons acquire brane - localized masses through the interaction @xmath50 where @xmath51 indexes the broken generators of the group and @xmath52 is the 5d gauge coupling , with mass dimension @xmath53 .",
    "if we were to decompose each @xmath1 and @xmath2 bulk vector field in a naive kaluza - klein ( kk ) basis , we would estimate that the zero modes have mass @xmath54 .",
    "such an estimate incorrectly assumes that the gauge boson wave functions do not change appreciably in the presence of the large localized mass term . to find the correct spectrum we must solve the differential equation @xmath55 which leads to kk masses @xmath56 given by @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "for @xmath59 this equation gives a spectrum whose low - lying levels are approximately @xmath60 ( with @xmath61 ) , whereas the usual kk spectrum is @xmath62 .",
    "we see that the kk tower has been shifted up one half unit .",
    "this is easy to understand intuitively .",
    "the gauge field picks up a mass of @xmath63 if it does not avoid the brane .",
    "if it avoids the brane entirely , it does not `` see '' the mass term , and picks up a smaller mass of @xmath64 from a nontrivial profile of the wave function in the extra dimension .",
    "the localized mass term acts merely to dynamically assign the boundary condition that the wave functions should vanish at the gut - breaking brane .",
    "the boundary condition is not absolute , of course , so that the spectrum is not precisely spaced according to @xmath65 .",
    "the value of the wave function at the gut - breaking brane goes as @xmath66 , and there are corrections to the mass which go like @xmath67 . modes with masses near or above the scale @xmath68 become essentially degenerate with the ordinary kk tower , @xmath69 .",
    "we have not broken supersymmetry , and thus the gauginos corresponding to the broken su(5 ) generators have an identical spectrum .",
    "the kk towers for the gauge fields are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum]a . for each unbroken su(3)@xmath7su(2)@xmath7u(1 ) ( 3 - 2 - 1 ) generator there is a massless vector multiplet and massive vector multiplets at @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and so on . for each broken ( @xmath73 ) generator",
    "there is a tower of massive vector multiplets whose low levels are offset from those of the 3 - 2 - 1 tower by @xmath74 , but whose higher levels relax into alignment with the 3 - 2 - 1 tower .",
    "although in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum]a this transition to degeneracy has already been achieved at @xmath75 , for the parameters of interest in our model , the relaxation will actually occur much more gradually , over the span of @xmath76 kk levels .",
    "note that for each @xmath73 massive vector multiplet but one there is a corresponding 3 - 2 - 1 massive vector multiplet .",
    "the remaining one is paired with the _ massless _ 3 - 2 - 1 vector multiplet , indicating a larger total number of states in the @xmath73 tower relative to the 3 - 2 - 1 tower .",
    "these excess states are the eaten goldstone degrees of freedom from the @xmath32 multiplet .",
    "this means that above the scale @xmath77 the kk towers of gauge fields contributing to the renormalization group ( rg ) running are completely su(5 ) symmetric except that one chiral adjoint for each 3 - 2 - 1 vector multiplet is missing .",
    "these missing degrees of freedom are provided by the physical @xmath32 fields which remain after the goldstone components of @xmath32 are eaten by the @xmath73 gauge multiplets .",
    "therefore , above the scale @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( the mass of physical @xmath32 fields ) , the spectrum contributing to the running is completely su(5 ) symmetric .",

    "since the two terms are both proportional to @xmath197 , we see that the higgs contribution to the differential running in 4d ( which takes place entirely below @xmath192 ) is emulated in 5d with the proper choice of compactification scale . had the differential running due to the higgs multiplets turned off right at @xmath74 , we would simply identify @xmath198 . because we find a small amount of differential running above @xmath74 , we instead identify @xmath199 .",
    "we expect small additional corrections to this quantity from further finite one - loop effects , but the precise value @xmath200 is not important : what matters is that , given any value of @xmath192 that leads to a successful prediction of @xmath9 in the 4d theory , there is a value for @xmath70 ( @xmath201 ) such that the total differential running due to higgs loops in the 5d theory will be the same as in the 4d theory .",
    "having chosen this value for @xmath70 , @xmath193 arises entirely from loops of gauge and physical @xmath32 fields : @xmath202 where the first term comes from the ordinary 4d running below @xmath74 , and two terms in the curly bracket represent the contributions from gauge kk towers and physical @xmath32 fields , respectively ( for the parameterization of the gauge contribution , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta ] ) ) .",
    "we find that this has the same form as eq .",
    "( [ eq:4dunif ] ) , with the required identification @xmath203 note that @xmath204 under @xmath205 , where @xmath206 is some mass scale which is a function of @xmath70 and @xmath78 , so that the quantity in the left - hand side has a well - defined value which is a function of @xmath207 and @xmath142 .",
    "( @xmath78 is the scale at which the differential running almost ceases in the 5d theory . )",
    "we see that _ the form of differential running above the higgs triplet mass in minimal su(5 ) is precisely what arises from threshold effects in the case of the five dimensional theory .",
    "_ this holds irrespective of whether the step - function approximation of fields in the rg running is very good or not .",
    "for instance , had we used the full one - loop calculation as in ref .",
    "@xcite , all gauge contributions would still be proportional to @xmath208 . at one loop ,",
    "the structure of unification is equivalent to that of minimal su(5 ) . that this model can successfully yield @xmath185 is no more nor less remarkable than in four - dimensional unified theories .",
    "the remarkable feature is that the grand unified group is broken `` maximally '' , at a scale well above the masses of the lightest @xmath1 and @xmath2 gauge bosons .",
    "this feature changes the predictions of the theory , as we will see in sections [ sec : protondecay ] and [ sec : yukawas ] .",
    "let us make one final comment regarding the differential running of the couplings . in a sense , its logarithmic ( as opposed to power law ) behavior is natural .",
    "the power law evolution is characteristic of the bulk ( _ i.e. _ , five dimensional ) nature of the gauge coupling .",
    "in contrast , the su(5 ) breaking occurs strictly on a brane . simply by lorentz invariance",
    ", the brane breaking can not contribute to the bulk coupling , but instead should just generate a brane contribution to the gauge kinetic term .",
    "consequently , we would not _ a priori _ have expected the effects of this su(5 ) breaking to exhibit a power law behavior .",
    "now that we have shown the direct correspondence between the differential running in our model to that of ordinary minimal su(5 ) , we can determine the scale at which successful unification occurs .",
    "in other words , given a compactification scale @xmath101 , we can find the values of @xmath142 and @xmath209 that give @xmath9 correctly .",
    "the allowed compactification scales are already known : these are related to the allowed values of @xmath210 in minimal su(5 ) by @xmath211 .",
    "then we need only to find the values of @xmath142 and @xmath209 for which eq .",
    "( [ eq : connect ] ) holds .",
    "these values are indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : allowedscales ] for compactification scales between @xmath212 and @xmath213 ( corresponding to @xmath214 gev and @xmath215 gev ) . for these compactification scales ,",
    "the 5d planck scale @xmath0 is @xmath216 gev , and fig .",
    "[ fig : allowedscales ] shows that the gut - breaking scale can be at or near this scale and the unification of three gauge couplings can be attained below @xmath0 depending on the parameters of the model . or @xmath78 is above the 5d planck scale , the gauge unification is not completed in a field theoretic regime . in this case ,",
    "our field theoretic treatment is not fully trustable above @xmath0 and would have some uncertainties coming from the cutoff scale physics . ] in the parameter region where the field theoretic unification works , the ratio of the cutoff to the compactification scales is @xmath217 , and no gauge or yukawa couplings become nonperturbative below the cutoff scale .",
    "thus , our one - loop treatment of the running is well justified .",
    "we also find that @xmath209 must be somewhat smaller than @xmath0 in this parameter region .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that the theory is more or less strongly coupled at the scale @xmath0 to have @xmath4 yukawa and gauge couplings in 4d ; if the theory is strongly coupled at @xmath0 , @xmath209 is naturally @xmath218 , since the superpotential giving the vev of @xmath32 scales like @xmath219 .",
    "even then , however , the @xmath32 couples to the other fields in the combination of @xmath220 , so that various operators feel order one gut breaking , since @xmath221 .",
    "therefore , we treat as if @xmath32 has a vev of order @xmath0 in the following discussions , although all the arguments also apply in the strongly coupled case , @xmath218 .",
    "we finally comment on effects from brane operators like @xmath222 where @xmath223 and @xmath224 is the field strength superfield .",
    "although it is possible that these operators are somehow suppressed at the cut - off scale , from effective field theory point of view it is generically expected that they are present with order one coefficients .",
    "they give tree - level splitting of three gauge couplings for su(3 ) , su(2 ) and u(1 ) , and could affect the previous analysis of the gauge coupling unification . in particular , since we are considering @xmath225 , one might think that they give @xmath4 correction to @xmath9 .",
    "however , we can expect that the effect of these operators are actually smaller by making the following observations .",
    "as an example , let us first consider the extreme case where all the interactions are strongly coupled at the scale @xmath0 .",
    "then , the operators involving the field strength superfield scale as @xmath226,\\ ] ] where @xmath227 is an @xmath4 quantity .",
    "( strictly speaking , @xmath227 must be somewhat smaller than 1 so that all higher dimensional operators involving @xmath228 do not equally contribute and make the theory unpredictable . ) on integrating over @xmath229 , the zero - mode 4d gauge couplings @xmath230 are given as @xmath231 here , the first and second terms are su(5)-preserving and su(5)-violating contributions , respectively .",
    "since we know that @xmath232 , we have to take @xmath233 in this strongly coupled case .",
    "this shows that the su(5)-violating contribution coming from brane operators is suppressed by a factor of @xmath234 in this case .",
    "in fact , the theory is not truly strongly coupled at the scale @xmath0 in the realistic case discussed in previous sections so that the one - loop treatment of gauge coupling evolutions is reliable .",
    "nevertheless , the above argument applies more generically ; the su(5)-violating brane contribution is small relative to the su(5)-preserving bulk contribution due to the large volume factor @xmath235 .",
    "thus , the correction to @xmath9 is expected to be small .",
    "we will not discuss possible effects of the brane operators further , and assume that they are negligible in the subsequent discussions .",
    "one of the key signals of grand unification is proton decay . @xmath1 and @xmath2 gauge boson exchange generates dimension six proton decay operators in the low energy theory , and higgsino triplet exchange generates dimension five operators .",
    "one might expect that since the particles appear at a scale @xmath236 , this will be the suppression scale of the proton decay operators .",
    "one interesting possibility offered by this framework is that _ the rate of proton decay is not constrained by gauge invariance to be related to the strength of gauge and yukawa interactions in the usual way . _",
    "we have already noted that the dangerous particles have wave functions at the @xmath31 fixed point that are small compared with those of their 3 - 2 - 1 or doublet counterparts . on the other hand",
    ", there is a tower of states that can mediate proton decay , and we must sum each contribution . in this section ,",
    "we investigate proton decay operators generated by exchanges of @xmath237 gauge bosons and colored higgsinos , and show that the present model can satisfy the constraints coming from experimental lower bounds on the proton lifetime .",
    "dimension six proton decay operators arise from the exchange of @xmath1 and @xmath2 gauge bosons .",
    "the coupling of these bosons to fields on the brane is suppressed by a factor @xmath238 .",
    "comparison with four - dimensional theories can be made by replacing @xmath239 where @xmath151 are the masses of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 gauge boson kk modes .",
    "these masses satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : gaugespectrum ] ) , which allows us to approximate the sum as @xmath240 thus , the `` effective mass '' of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons is @xmath241 . for @xmath209 at or near the five dimensional planck scale , this will typically be larger than @xmath184 , although it is not required to satisfy experimental constraints .",
    "in any case , despite the fact that the lightest @xmath1 and @xmath2 gauge bosons have masses of only @xmath242 gev , it is easy to satisfy proton decay constraints coming from dimension six operators in this model .      dimension five operators come from integrating out the higgsino triplets .",
    "again , we make connection with the four dimensional theory by finding an effective triplet higgsino mass by taking the whole sum over kk modes . here",
    "we make the replacement @xmath243 where @xmath126 are the masses of the colored higgs kk modes , given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : higgsspectrum ] ) . using this spectrum",
    ", we obtain the sum @xmath244 thus , proton decay from dimension five operators is suppressed by a factor @xmath245 compared to the compactification scale . in ordinary minimal su(5 ) , proton decay limits require @xmath246 gev , so for a compactification scale of @xmath247 , we would need a @xmath46 parameter of ten to adequately suppress proton decay operators .",
    "this leaves open the possibility that proton decay could be observed in future experiments .",
    "however , for larger @xmath46 detection becomes increasingly unlikely .",
    "in addition to the ordinary yukawa couplings between the higgs and matter fields on the brane , there can be derivative couplings of the conjugate higgs fields to the matter fields as well .",
    "these operators such as @xmath248 can lead to proton decay .",
    "of course , coefficients @xmath249 and @xmath250 of these operators are not related to the usual yukawa couplings , @xmath251 and @xmath252 , by su(5 ) , so that their actual significance is unknown .",
    "furthermore , there is an ambiguity in what we mean by the derivative of the conjugate field , which is not differentiable at the point @xmath31 .",
    "however , using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : higgsinoeqs1 ] ) and ( [ eq : higgsinoeqs2 ] ) , we can rewrite the coupling as @xmath253 where the summation over @xmath254 arises from rewriting the @xmath255-function as a sum of the kk mode .    while we can compute proton decay diagrams involving these vertices , it is now apparent that such diagrams have a strong dependence on how we cut off the sum of the kk mode . if the cutoff is done near the fundamental scale , these diagrams can , at least in principle , give comparable contribution to those involving the usual yukawa couplings . however , it is not entirely clear what the cutoff for these diagrams should be . in the case where the brane is dynamical ,",
    "the summation in the above operators are cut off at the scale of the brane tension @xcite . for couplings at the orbifold fixed point , which is not dynamical and can not fluctuate",
    ", it is unclear whether the cutoff is the fundamental scale or a lower scale , such as the radion mass .    for our purposes here",
    ", we will not address these issues further . since we can not _ a priori _ know the size of the couplings of these operators and their flavor structure , estimating the resulting proton decay rate is already very uncertain .",
    "however , it is possible that such operators may provide an opportunity for detectable dimension five proton decay in the near future .",
    "so far , we have a framework that looks like ordinary su(5 ) except with suppressed proton decay .",
    "while the breaking occurs at a scale near the 5d planck scale @xmath0 , the @xmath237 gauge bosons are much lighter .",
    "still , in a very real sense , the breaking of su(5 ) is `` maximal '' , which can manifest itself in deviations from su(5 ) expectations .",
    "we here consider the effects of such maximal gut breaking on the fermion yukawa couplings .    in the minimal su(5 ) , one important prediction is the unification of the yukawa couplings",
    ". a successful prediction of the theory is the unification of the bottom and @xmath256 yukawa couplings at the gut scale @xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that the su(5 ) relations fail in the lighter first - two generations . for instance , an su(5 ) relation @xmath257 fails by a factor of ten",
    ". terms to the yukawa couplings @xcite . ]    in ordinary 4d su(5 ) gut , it has been suggested that the operators involving the @xmath32 field can correct this discrepancy @xcite .",
    "however , this mechanism does not work in most theories where the fermion mass hierarchy is explained by the froggatt - nielsen mechanism @xcite . in this mechanism ,",
    "the matter fields carry generation dependent flavor u(1 ) charges and the various yukawa couplings are generated through the u(1 ) breaking spurion .",
    "this is an attractive mechanism in that it not only suppresses the first - two generation yukawa couplings but also suppresses dangerous tree - level dimension five proton decay operators .",
    "however , having employed this mechanism , the gut - breaking operators involving @xmath209 can modify su(5 ) mass relations only by an amount suppressed by a factors of @xmath13 , which is too small to accommodate order one deviations suggested by the observed quark and lepton masses .",
    "field @xcite . ]    in the present model , on the other hand , there is no suppression of higher dimensional operators involving gut - breaking effects , since @xmath209 is near the cut - off scale @xmath0 . in this sense , fields living on the gut - breaking brane",
    "see the gut broken maximally , and their yukawa couplings need not respect the su(5 ) symmetry .",
    "thus , the failure of su(5 ) to describe @xmath258 seems quite natural . in this framework , however , the success of the @xmath259-@xmath260 unification must be viewed as an accident , unless there is a reason why the coupling of @xmath32 to the third generation is somewhat suppressed .",
    "up to this point , we have restricted our attention to a scenario with su(5 ) gauge group , but it is interesting to consider larger gauge groups .",
    "one possible difference comes from additional matter fields required by larger gauge groups .",
    "for instance , in so(10 ) there is an additional state , right - handed neutrino .",
    "if this additional field acquires a mass around the cut - off scale @xmath261 from so(10 ) breaking , then there will be a running effect between @xmath101 and @xmath261 which is not so(10 ) universal .",
    "it is , however , important that this does not affect our previous analyses ; the 3 - 2 - 1 unification still works as in section [ sec : diffrunning ] even in the case of so(10 ) .",
    "the additional higgs states do not contribute to differential running above @xmath101 , and the threshold effects are proportional to 3 - 2 - 1 @xmath262-functions .",
    "this means that we can have larger gauge groups broken all the way to 3 - 2 - 1 around the cut - off scale . in the so(10 ) case , this may result in too large right - handed neutrino masses to give an appropriate mass scale for atmospheric oscillations @xcite through see - saw mechanism @xcite . then , we may need somewhat small coefficient in front of the operator which gives right - handed neutrino masses or have to resort to other ways to generate neutrino masses within supersymmetric models , for instance , though @xmath263-parity violation @xcite or supersymmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the possibility that the standard model gauge group is merely a subgroup of a larger , simple group is an attractive one .",
    "unfortunately , the simplest version of supersymmetric su(5 ) predicts proton decay at rates incompatible with experiment .",
    "we have demonstrated that the incorporation of just one new ingredient  an additional dimension in which gauge and higgs fields propagate  brings about crucial changes relative to ordinary guts .",
    "the couplings of the lightest @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons are no longer directly linked through gauge symmetry to those of the lightest 3 - 2 - 1 bosons , and the couplings of the lightest higgs triplets are no longer directly linked to those of the higgs doublets .",
    "the strong breaking of the gut symmetry `` pushes away '' the wave functions of these states , suppressing the generated proton decay below experimental limits , all while retaining _",
    "ordinary , logarithmic unification_. such features seem special to a five dimensional theory , incapable of reproduction in simple four dimensional theories .",
    "the presence of extra dimensions of this size has been motivated previously as a means to resolve the supersymmetric flavor problem @xcite .",
    "our gut - breaking picture can nicely fit into this framework of supersymmetry - breaking mediation .",
    "for instance , if supersymmetry is broken at @xmath30 fixed point by @xmath264-term vev of singlet or non - singlet field , it naturally realizes the scenarios of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the incorporation of our gut picture within these scenarios may give interesting signatures , since we now have one more piece of information about parameters of the model ; the compactification radius is determined by the gauge coupling unification .",
    "we leave an investigation of detailed phenomenology for future work",
    ".    to summarize , the framework we have described is very simple , but can describe various observed features such as gauge coupling unification , lack of unification in yukawa couplings , the absence of proton decay , and so on",
    ". it will be interesting to add non - minimal structure to the model as a means of deriving experimental signatures .",
