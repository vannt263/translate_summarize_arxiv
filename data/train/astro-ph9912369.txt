    "the antennae ( ngc  4038/4039 ) are a pair of disk galaxies in an early stage of merging which contain numerous massive super star clusters ( sscs ) along their spiral arms and around their interaction region ( @xcite ) .",
    "the molecular gas distribution peaks at both nuclei and in the overlap region ( @xcite ) , but the gas is not yet undergoing a global starburst typical of more advanced mergers ( @xcite ) .",
    "star formation in starbursts appears to occur preferentially in sscs .",
    "we chose to observe the antennae because their proximity permits an unusually detailed view of the first generation of merger - induced sscs and their influence on the surrounding interstellar medium .",
    "the infrared space observatory ( iso ) @xmath19 m image showed that the hot dust distribution is similar to that of the gas , but peaks at an otherwise inconspicuous point on the southern edge of the overlap region ( @xcite ; see @xcite ) .",
    "this powerful starburst knot is also a flat - spectrum radio continuum source ( @xcite ) and may be associated with an x - ray source ( @xcite ) .",
    "we imaged the region around this knot , and discovered a bright compact star cluster coincident with the mid - ir peak .",
    "we obtained moderate - resolution ( r @xmath5 ) k - band spectra of both the obscured cluster and the ngc  4039 nucleus .",
    "nirspec is a new facility infrared ( @xmath20 m ) spectrometer for the keck - ii telescope , commissioned during april through july , 1999 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has a cross - dispersed cryogenic echelle with r @xmath21 , and a low resolution mode with r @xmath22 .",
    "the spectrometer detector is a 1024 @xmath23 1024 insb aladdin focal plane array , and the ir slit - viewing camera detector is a 256 @xmath23 256 hgcdte picnic array .",
    "we observed the antennae with nirspec during the june 1999 commissioning run .",
    "figure  [ scam ] shows the hst and iso image of @xcite together with nirspec slit - viewing camera ( scam ) images at 2 @xmath4 m ; the scam images reveal that the mid - ir iso peak is a bright ( k @xmath24 ) compact star cluster located 20.4 east and 4.7 north of the k - band nucleus .",
    "this cluster is associated with a faint ( v @xmath25 ) red ( v@xmath3i @xmath26 ) source ( # 80 in @xcite ) visible with space telescope ( whitmore & zhang , private communication ) .",
    "we obtained low resolution ( r @xmath27 ) @xmath28 m spectra through a @xmath29 slit at pa=77@xmath30 located on the obscured star cluster and the nucleus of ngc  4039 , for a total integration time of 2100 s. we reduced the data following the standard procedure , described in more detail by @xcite .",
    "reduced spectra are shown in figures  [ cluster ] and [ nucleus ] .",
    "the cluster spectrum is characterized by strong emission linesagilbert / antennae . ] and a continuum ( detected with snr @xmath31 ) dominated by the light of hot , blue stars and dust .",
    "the nebular emission lines are slightly more extended than the continuum , and the h@xmath32 emission is even more extended .",
    "this suggests a picture in which hot stars and dust are embedded in a giant compact h  ii region surrounded by clumpy ( see  3.2 ) clouds of obscuring gas and dust whose surfaces are ionized and photodissociated by fuv photons escaping from the star cluster .    for a distance to the antennae of 19 mpc ( h@xmath33=75 km s@xmath34 mpc@xmath34 , 1= 93 pc ) ( @xcite ) , we find that the cluster has m@xmath35 .",
    "we estimate the screen extinction to the cluster by assuming a range of ( v@xmath3k)@xmath36 as expected from starburst99 models ( @xcite ) , and that a@xmath37 a@xmath38 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we find a@xmath39 mag , which implies m@xmath40 , adopting a@xmath41 ( which is confirmed by our analysis of the recombination lines in  3.1 ) .",
    "we can use the intrinsic brightness along with the lyman continuum flux inferred from the de - reddened br@xmath42 flux ( @xmath43 erg s@xmath34 @xmath44 ) , q(h@xmath45 photons s@xmath34 , to constrain the cluster mass and age . using instantaneous starburst99 models",
    "we find a total mass of @xmath46 m@xmath8 ( with @xmath47 o stars ) for a salpeter imf extending from 1 to 100 m@xmath48 , and an age of @xmath6 myr .",
    "this age is consistent with the lack of photospheric co and metal absorption lines from red supergiants and other cool giants , which would begin to contribute significantly to the 2 @xmath4 m light at an age of @xmath49 myr ( @xcite ) .",
    "the cluster s density is then about 115 m@xmath8 pc@xmath10 for stars of 0.1@xmath3100 m@xmath8 within a half - light radius of @xmath50 pc .",
    "this density is 30 times less than that of the lmc ssc , r136 ( within a radius of 1.7 pc , assuming a salpeter proportion of low - mass stars ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus the antennae cluster may be a complex of clusters rather than one massive cluster .",
    "the cluster spectrum features a variety of nebular lines that reveal information about the conditions in and around the gas ionized gas by the cluster , which in turn allows us to constrain the effective temperature of the ionizing stars .",
    "we detected pfund series lines from pf  19 to pf  38 , which allow us to infer the extinction across the k window .",
    "we display the pfund fluxes relative to that of br@xmath42 in figure  [ pfund ] , where filled symbols give fluxes for the blends pf 28+h@xmath32 2@xmath31 s(0 ) and pf 29 + [ ] .",
    "they fall well above the other points , which follow closely the theoretical expectation for intensities relative to br@xmath42 ( solid curve ) with no reddening applied , for a gas with n@xmath51 cm@xmath10 and t@xmath52 k ( @xcite ) . excluding the two known blends , the best - fit foreground screen extinction is a@xmath53 mag ( dashed curve ) , assuming the extinction law of @xcite and evaluated at 2.2 @xmath4 m .",
    "we consider this an upper limit on a@xmath54 because a close look at the spectrum shows that the points above the dashed line in figure  [ pfund ] for pf 22@xmath324 at 2.404 , 2.393 , and 2.383 @xmath4 m may also be blended or contaminated by sky emission , implying a lower a@xmath54 and a much better fit to the theory .",
    "hence the majority of the extinction to the cluster is bypassed by observing it in k band .    the ratios of [ ] 2.146 @xmath4 m and 2.243 @xmath4 m lines to [ ] 2.218 @xmath4 m are nebular density diagnostics , consistent with a fairly high density , n@xmath55 cm@xmath10 .",
    "( see @xcite for more detail . )",
    "the line ratios can be used to infer nebular temperature t@xmath56 , and are fairly insensitive to n@xmath56 .",
    "we find the ratio 2.1128 + 2.1137 @xmath4m/",
    "2.0589 @xmath4 m = 0.052 @xmath57 0.003 , which for n@xmath56=10@xmath58 cm@xmath10 is consistent with t@xmath59 k ( @xcite ) .",
    "however this is much hotter than typical nebular temperatures , and may indicate some non - nebular contribution from hot stars to the line emission .",
    "the 2.0589 @xmath4m / br  @xmath42 ratio is an indicator of the t@xmath60 of hot stars in regions ( @xcite ) , although it is sensitive to nebular conditions such as the relative volumes and ionization fractions of he@xmath61 and h@xmath61 , geometry , density , dustiness , etc .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite studied h and he excitation in a sample of starburst galaxies and regions . for starbursts they found evidence for high - t@xmath60 ,",
    "low - n@xmath56 ( @xmath62 @xmath44 ) ionized gas from 2.0589 @xmath4m / br  @xmath42 ratios of 0.22 to 0.64 .",
    "the ultra - compact regions were characterized by higher ratios ( 0.8@xmath30.9 ) and higher densities , @xmath63 10@xmath58 cm@xmath10 . the cluster has a flux ratio of 0.70 , a value between the two object classes of @xcite .",
    "assuming the line emission is purely nebular , this ratio is consistent with a high - density ( 10@xmath58 cm@xmath10 ) model of @xcite ( also indicated by the [ ] emission ) , and implies t@xmath64 k for the assumed model parameters .",
    "the cluster has properties more like those of a compact region than a diffuse one .",
    "it appears to be a young , hot , high - density region , one of the first to form in this part of the antennae interaction region .",
    "the spectrum shows evidence for almost pure uv fluorescence excited by fuv radiation from the o & b stars ; the strong , vibrationally excited 1@xmath30 , 2@xmath31 & 3@xmath32 h@xmath32 emission has t@xmath65  k and t@xmath66 , 1600 , and 1800 k , respectively , and weak higher - v ( 6@xmath34 , 8@xmath36 , 9@xmath37 ) transitions are present as well .",
    "the h@xmath32 lines are extended over @xmath67  pc , about twice the extent of the continuum and nebular line emission , so a significant fraction of the fuv ( 912@xmath31108  ) light escapes from the cluster to heat and photodissociate the local molecular ism .",
    "we compared the photodissociation region ( pdr ) models of @xcite with our data by calculating reduced @xmath68 .",
    "models with high densities ( n@xmath69 cm@xmath10 ) , moderately warm temperatures ( t @xmath70 to 1500 k at the cloud surface ) , and high fuv fields ( g@xmath71 times the mean interstellar field ) can reasonably fit the data .",
    "figure  [ chisq ] shows @xmath68 contours for all models projected onto the n@xmath72g@xmath33 plane .",
    "the best - fit draine & bertoldi model is n2023b , which has n@xmath73 = 10@xmath74 cm@xmath10 , t = 900 k , and g@xmath75 .",
    "we fit 22 h@xmath32 lines , excluding 3@xmath32 s(2 ) 2.287 @xmath4 m because it appears to be blended with a strong unidentified nebular line at 2.286 @xmath4 m found in higher - resolution spectra of planetary nebulae ( @xcite ) .",
    "the weak high - v transitions are all under - predicted by this model , and appear to come from lower - density gas ( n@xmath76 cm@xmath10 ) exposed to a weaker fuv field ( g@xmath77 ) .",
    "the ortho / para ratio of excited h@xmath32 determined from the relative column densities inferred from 1@xmath30 s(1 ) and s(0 ) lines is 1.62@xmath570.07 .",
    "this is consistent with the ground state v=0 h@xmath32 being in lte with ortho / para ratio of 3 if the fuv absorption lines populating the non - lte excited states are optically thick ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the best - fit pdr models have temperatures that are comparable with t@xmath78 in the lowest excited states .",
    "if the extent of the h@xmath32 emission indicates that the mean - free path of a fuv photon is @xmath16 pc , then @xmath79n@xmath80 = 3 cm@xmath10 for a galactic gas - to - dust ratio , while in the pdr(s ) n@xmath73 = 10@xmath81 cm@xmath10 .",
    "this implies that the molecular gas is extremely clumpy , which is consistent with the range of densities inferred from the detection of anomalously strong v = 8@xmath36 h@xmath32 emission .",
    "the highest surface brightness mid - ir peak in the iso map of the antennae galaxies is a massive ( @xmath8210@xmath83 m@xmath8 ) , obscured ( a@xmath14 ) , young ( age @xmath6 myr ) star cluster with half - light radius @xmath63 32 pc , whose strong fuv flux excites the surrounding molecular ism on scales of up to 200 pc .",
    "the cluster spectrum is dominated by extended fluorescently excited h@xmath84 emission from clumpy pdrs and nebular emission from compact regions . in contrast",
    ", the nearby nucleus of ngc  4039 has a strong stellar spectrum dominated by cool stars , where the only emission lines are due to shock - excited h@xmath32 .",
    "these observations confirm the potential of near - infrared spectroscopy for exploration and discovery with the new generation of large ground - based telescopes .",
    "our ongoing program of nirspec observations promises to reveal a wealth of information on the nature of star formation in star clusters .",
