    "the multi - time correlation function is then defined as @xmath23 for the @xmath15 model , and similarly for the @xmath16 model , for which we denote the correlation function as @xmath24 . then there",

    "that model can be also considered as one of nonintersecting paths on the interval , but with periodic rather than absorbing or reflecting boundary conditions . for that model",
    "it was shown that the correlation kernel could be expressed in terms of a system of orthogonal polynomials with respect to a discrete gaussian weight , and that it converged to the _ tacnode kernel _ and the _ pearcey kernel _ in different scaling limits .",
    "the result was a formula for the tacnode kernel which involved certain solutions to the flaschka  newell lax pair for the painlev ii equation .",

    "the dependence of the models @xmath15 and @xmath16 on the total time @xmath31 is described heuristically as follows .",
    "since all particles are forced to begin and end at the lower wall , if the total time @xmath31 is small then the particles will not have time to approach the upper wall at @xmath32 , and the model is very close to a model of nonintersecting brownian bridges on the half - line @xmath33 . on the other hand , if @xmath31 is large enough then the particles will reach the barrier at @xmath32 around some critical time @xmath34 and the asymptotic limiting density of particles fills the entire interval @xmath2 $ ] throughout the time interval @xmath35 $ ] before beginning to return to the origin .",
    "these two cases are separated by a critical total time @xmath36 , and it can be shown as in @xcite that this critical value is @xmath37 . therefore , as in @xcite we separate the @xmath15 and @xmath16 models into three cases : subcritical ( @xmath38 ) , critical ( @xmath39 ) , and supercritical @xmath40 , see figure [ fig : global_picture ] .",

    "the even and odd pearcey processes are special cases of a more general family of determinantal processes which depends on a real parameter @xmath122 , and arises as a scaling limit in a model of nonintersecting ( squared ) bessel paths .",
    "we refer to this family as the _ hard - edge pearcey process_. the single time version of this kernel for general @xmath123 was first derived by desrosiers and forrester @xcite in the context of random matrix theory , and by kuijlaars , martnez - finkelshtein , and wielonsky @xcite from nonintersecting squared bessel paths .",
