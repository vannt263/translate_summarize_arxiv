    "ngc 4151 ( z=0.00332 ) is a well - studied seyfert 1.5 galaxy .",
    "it is known to be extended in soft x - rays from einstein and rosat observations @xcite .",
    "the nature of the extended x - ray emission was postulated to be either thermal emission from a collisionally ionized plasma or scattered nuclear flux . @xcite",
    "modeled the asca spectrum by 3 components : an absorbed power law plus reprocessed emission from a warm absorber and an extra scattered component .",
    "variability was observed in the column density of the warm absorber .",
    "spectral complexity from unresolved emission lines and ionized absorption edges has been seen in the residuals of power - law fits to the spectra of many seyfert galaxies .",
    "recent observations with chandra have revealed narrow absorption and emission lines in the spectra of seyfert 1 galaxies ngc 5548  @xcite and ngc 3783  @xcite .",
    "these two sources are dominated by continuum emission from the central source , so absorption lines are more prominent than emission lines . on the other hand ,",
    "the nucleus of ngc 4151 is highly absorbed , giving a good view of its narrow emission line region .    in this paper",
    "we present chandra high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) observations of ngc 4151 .",
    "we identify and measure a large number of narrow emission lines in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the high spectral resolution provided by hetgs allows us to study the ionization , temperature , and kinematics of the x - ray emitting regions .",
    "we discuss the association of the extended x - ray emission with the narrow - line region , and interpretations of the multiple x - ray emitting components in the spectrum .",
    "we observed ngc 4151 for 48 ks on 2000 march 5 with chandra hetgs  @xcite , at a roll angle of @xmath2 .",
    "the dispersion directions of the high energy grating ( heg ) and the medium energy grating ( meg ) made acute angles of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , with the direction of the extended x - ray emission . since the source has appreciable extent along the dispersion direction ( see below ) , the spectral and spatial dimensions are mixed .",
    "spectral extractions and reductions were performed using ciao and idl .",
    "we used extraction windows of @xmath5 width in the cross - dispersion direction , which were centered on the nucleus of the 0-order image .",
    "the windows included most of the flux from the extended source .",
    "we then summed the plus and minus orders of the spectra .",
    "the flux calibration of hetgs is currently accurate to 10% for energies @xmath6 kev and 20% for @xmath7 kev .",
    "the wavelength calibration was tied to an hetgs observation of capella which was reduced in an identical manner to ngc 4151 ( using ciao , v. 2.0@xmath8 , 2000 august 6 ) . in this way we determined that velocities must be corrected by @xmath9 km s@xmath10 to remove a systematic wavelength calibration error that exists in standard - processed data .",
    "this error is currently attributed to an error in the ccd pixel scale , due to thermal contraction .",
    "corrected velocities are reported in table 1 .",
    "marginally redshifted x - ray narrow emission lines have been reported for ngc 5548  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath11 km s@xmath10 ) and ngc 3783  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath12 km s@xmath10 ) .",
    "these redshifts may be owing to similar wavelength calibration errors .",
    "ngc 4151 was in a low flux state during our observation , with @xmath13 photons s@xmath10 @xmath14 @xmath10 at 2  .",
    "we show the first order heg and meg spectra in figure 1 . above 6    ( below 2.1 kev ) , the spectrum is dominated by emission lines .",
    "table 1 gives a list of the identified emission lines , their fluxes , and velocities relative to the galaxy rest frame .",
    "we compare the hetgs 0-order x - ray ( 0.4 - 2.5 kev ) image of ngc 4151 to an optical [ o iii ] 5007 image from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) ( fig .",
    "2 ) . there is a good , but not exact correspondence between the structure of the optical and soft x - ray emission regions .",
    "the x - ray emission has a similar extent ( @xmath15  kpc ) and orientation ( pa@xmath16 ) to the optical narrow - line region ( nlr ) .",
    "most ( 70% ) of the soft x - ray emission is resolved by chandra ; the rest comes from an fwhm@xmath17 nucleus .",
    "the hard x - ray emission ( e@xmath182.5 kev ) is consistent with a nuclear point source .",
    "the spatial profiles of the narrow emission lines are extended ( figure 3 ) .",
    "we show three lines , from three different ionization states : o vii ( f ) , o viii ly@xmath8 , and fe i k@xmath8 .",
    "all three lines have similar spatial profiles to the 0-order soft x - ray image , and can be traced out to a distance of @xmath19  pc from the nucleus .",
    "hetgs is rather insensitive to relativistically broadened fe k@xmath8 emission .",
    "@xcite fit asca observations of fe k@xmath8 with broad ( @xmath20 kev ) and narrow components having equivalent widths of @xmath21 ev and @xmath22 ev , respectively .",
    "we find an equivalent width of @xmath23 ev for narrow fe i k@xmath8 with the heg .",
    "the narrow core of the line is unresolved , with fwhm@xmath24 km / s .",
    "the spectrum of ngc 4151 is hybrid , with line emission coming from both photoionized and collisionally ionized plasmas .",
    "there are several strong indications of a photoionized component .",
    "first , we see narrow radiative recombination continua ( rrcs ) from n vii , o vii , o viii , ne ix , and ne x. we estimate half widths ( at 37% peak flux ) for the rrcs which range from 1 - 4 ev , corresponding to temperatures of @xmath25 k. to have such a low temperature and contain such high ionization states , the plasma where the rrc originates must be dominated by photoionization .",
    "the ratio of the o vii forbidden to resonance emission lines ( @xmath26 ) is also consistent with photoionized plasma @xcite .",
    "in addition , relatively strong @xmath27 transitions of n vi , ne ix , and mg xi are indicative of photoionization  @xcite . the strength of o , ne , mg , and si k - shell emission lines and relative weakness of fe l - shell lines are additional characteristics of a photoionized plasma  @xcite .      except for o vii ,",
    "the he - like lines have a small @xmath28 ratio , which means that collisional ionization is important .",
    "the ne ix lines have @xmath29 .",
    "a ratio @xmath30 is expected for a photoionized plasma , and @xmath31 for a collisionally ionized plasma with @xmath32 k. there is clearly a mixture of line emission from both types of plasma .",
    "we note that fluorescent excitation by the continuum and resonance scattering may lead to enhancement of resonance lines under special circumstances  @xcite .",
    "however , we would expect these processes to equally effect the o vii and other he - like resonance lines , which is not the case .",
    "the ly@xmath8 lines of o viii , ne x , and mg xii also have a large contribution from collisionally ionized plasma .",
    "the o viii ly@xmath8 line is much stronger than the o viii rrc , while a ratio near unity is expected for a pure photoionized plasma .",
    "we find that @xmath33 of the o viii ly@xmath8 emission comes from the hot plasma component of the nlr .",
    "similarly , @xmath34 of the ne x ly@xmath8 emission comes from this component .",
    "a large fraction of the mg xii ly@xmath8 flux must also have a collisional origin , since the mg xii rrc ( 6.32  ) is not even detected .    from the range of formation temperatures of the collisionally augmented lines",
    ", we deduce that there is plasma in the temperature range @xmath35 k. the nondetection of s xvi emission ( 4.73  , @xmath36 photons @xmath14 s@xmath10 ) is partly owing to the strong continuum at that wavelength .",
    "however , the detection of fe xxv ( @xmath37 k ) suggests that hotter gas is present .",
    "a more thorough analysis will be necessary to derive the volume emission measure vs. temperature distribution of the hot plasma .",
    "we characterize the continuum emission from ngc 4151 with the sum of two absorbed power laws .",
    "the hard continuum ( @xmath38 kev ) has a photon index @xmath39 and normalization @xmath40 photons kev@xmath10 @xmath14 s@xmath10 at 1 kev , absorbed by a neutral column of @xmath41 @xmath14 . the observed 2 - 10 kev flux is @xmath42 ergs @xmath43 .",
    "the soft continuum ( @xmath44 kev ) has a photon index of @xmath45 and normalization @xmath46 photons kev@xmath10 @xmath14 s@xmath10 at 1 kev , absorbed by a galactic column of @xmath47 @xmath14 .",
    "we deduce that there is strong absorption of the hard nuclear flux by a cloud which does not occult the bulk of the soft x - ray emitting nlr .",
    "@xcite observed a 2 - 10 kev flux of @xmath48 ergs @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 @xmath14 with asca .",
    "the hard continuum was harder and a factor of @xmath52 times fainter during our observation , but @xmath53 was similar",
    ". however , we note that poor statistics for energies above 7 kev in our data may bias the fit value for @xmath54 .",
    "@xcite also found variations in @xmath53 with asca on a time scale of 6 months , which suggests that absorption is taking place on a spatial scale much smaller than the nlr .",
    "the soft continuum of ngc 4151 has a much steeper photon index than the hard continuum ( 3.1 vs 0.4 ) .",
    "this argues against thomson scattered emission as the source of the soft continuum , unless the intrinsic nuclear continuum steepens drastically below 3 kev .",
    "thermal bremsstrahlung and blended fe l emission lines are therefore the most likely sources of the soft continuum .      the locations and velocity field of optically emitting clouds in the nlr of ngc 4151 have been mapped in detail by  @xcite , and are consistent with a biconical outflow from the nucleus .",
    "integrated long - slit spectroscopy of the central @xmath55 of the nlr gives a blueshift of -90 km s@xmath10 and a line width ( fwhm ) of 460 km s@xmath10 for the [ o iii ] 5007 line @xcite .",
    "the blueshifts and blue asymmetry of the optical lines are likely owing to obscuration of the far cone by dust .",
    "the unblended x - ray emission lines have an ( unweighted ) mean blueshift of @xmath56 km s@xmath10 with respect to the galaxy rest frame , as measured from its stellar spectrum .",
    "this is consistent with the velocity of the optical nlr .",
    "since the x - ray line widths are affected by spatial broadening , we can only get an upper limit to their velocity widths from the widths of the low energy lines .",
    "o vii ( f ) has an apparent width ( gaussian fwhm ) of @xmath57 km s@xmath10 , which equals the widths of the optical lines .",
    "it is interesting that the x - ray emission region is more extended in the front ( sw ) cone than the back cone ( fig .",
    "2 ) , suggesting that the soft x - rays from the back cone are obscured , like the optical emission .",
    "the similar spatial extent of the x - ray and optical emission line regions ( figs .",
    "2,3 ) and their similar kinematics are strong evidence that they are closely linked .",
    "x - ray emission from the nlr demonstrates that high energy processes are important in this region , at distances of 70 - 800 pc from the galactic nucleus .",
    "for the first time , there is direct evidence for at least 2 distinct gas phases in the extended nlr of a seyfert galaxy .",
    "one of the phases is cool ( @xmath1 k ) and photoionized , while the second is hot ( @xmath0 k ) and collisionally ionized .",
    "in addition , there is a large range in ionization of the photoionized region , as demonstrated by o i - o iii in the optical - uv spectrum and o vii in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "there are also strong k@xmath8 lines from neutral species in the x - ray spectrum , including fe i , si i , and mg i. detailed modeling will be necessary to determine the volume emission measure vs. ionization distribution of the photoionized component .",
    "a wide range of ionization is derived from photoionization models of the nlr of the circinus galaxy  @xcite , and might be explained by a radial gradient in the nlr density .",
    "a large percentage ( @xmath58 ) of the narrow fe i k@xmath8 emission comes from the extended nlr ( fig .",
    "this is contrary to the popular idea that the narrow emission comes primarily from a parsec scale torus .",
    "the remaining unresolved emission , which has an equivalent width of @xmath59 ev , may very well come from a torus .",
    "unlike ngc 5548 @xcite , there is no evidence for doppler broadening of the narrow fe i k@xmath8 line in ngc 4151 .",
    "it has been suggested that a hot , inter - cloud medium is necessary for pressure confinement of the nlr clouds  @xcite .",
    "the hot plasma we detect in our x - ray spectrum may form this medium .",
    "we derive volume emission measures for the thermal contribution to the ne x and o viii ly@xmath8 lines of @xmath60 @xmath61 , assuming @xmath62 , and line emissivities for solar abundances from @xcite .",
    "@xcite derive a half - opening angle of @xmath63 from kinematic models of the optical nlr .",
    "if the thermal x - ray line emission comes from a uniformly filled ( @xmath64 ) bicone in the central @xmath65 of the galaxy , then the mean plasma density is @xmath66 @xmath61 and the pressure is @xmath67 @xmath61 k. pressure equilibrium between the hot and cool phases of the x - ray nlr would then require a density of @xmath68 @xmath61 for the cool phase .",
    "the optical nlr clouds at @xmath69 have a density @xmath70 @xmath61 and a pressure of @xmath71 @xmath61 k  @xcite , much lower than what we find closer to the nucleus .",
    "however , we know that the spatial profile of the nlr flux is centrally peaked .",
    "a density profile of @xmath72 would account for the larger pressure of the nucleus than the extended nlr , assuming constant temperature .",
    "estimates of the pressure can be improved by modeling the density distribution to match the spatial profiles of the x - ray emission .",
    "a possible alternative is that the hot plasma is confined to shocks between the nl clouds and the host galaxy ism . in that case ,",
    "its filling factor @xmath73 would be much lower , and its density and pressure much higher than calculated above .",
    "the x - ray emission we observe in the chandra image has a clumpy morphology which follows the optically emitting clouds .",
    "this may be partly owing to emission from a shocked component .",
    "there is evidence for deceleration of the nl clouds at a radius of about @xmath55 from the nucleus  @xcite , perhaps from interaction with the ism .",
    "the power of chandra hetgs to elucidate the nature of the x - ray emission from active galactic nuclei is demonstrated by high resolution spectra and images of ngc 4151 . direct emission from the nucleus",
    "is highly absorbed .",
    "strong , narrow x - ray emission lines are seen from the spatially resolved nlr of ngc 4151 .",
    "the narrow radiative recombination continuum features and the o vii @xmath28 ratio are consistent with photoionization from the hard nuclear x - ray source .",
    "there is also narrow line emission from a hot , collisionally ionized component in the extended nlr .",
    "this may come from the long - sought intercloud medium or shocked plasma .",
    "in addition , we find strong narrow fe i k@xmath8 emission from the extended nlr .",
    "the composite nature of the nlr indicates that both photoionization and collisional heating are important . the extent and kinematics of both x - ray photoionized clouds and hot thermal plasma match those of the optical nlr , showing that they are closely connected .",
    "we also suggest that the narrow x - ray emission lines seen in some other seyfert galaxies may come from the nlr , and may be interpreted in the light of these ngc 4151 observations .",

    "we also thank the referee , kim weaver , for many helpful comments .",
