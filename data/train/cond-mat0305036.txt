    "there are over hundred different types of dunes that have been classified by geomorphologists according to their shape and size @xcite .",
    "dunes can be found in deserts , in coastal areas , on the sea - bottom @xcite , and even on mars @xcite .",
    "although no general theoretical model has been developed up to now to explain this wide variety of dune shapes , it is well known that the dune morphology is mainly determined by the amount of available sand and by the behavior of the wind over the year .",
    "the simplest type of dunes occurs when there is not very much sand , and when the direction of the blowing wind does nt change with time .",
    "these dunes have a crescent - like shape and are called `` barchans '' . since the pioneering work of bagnold in 1941 @xcite , several field measurements led to a good understanding of barchan dunes .",
    "in particular , it has been observed that these dunes move without changing their shape with a velocity which is inversely proportional to their height @xcite .",
    "fields with hundreds of barchans are found for instance in peru @xcite , namibia @xcite and marroco @xcite . in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "a two - dimensional model to describe the collective motion of barchan dunes has been presented , which was able to reproduce the same kind of spatial correlations between the dunes as in real dune fields .",
    "as the sand availability becomes larger , parallel dunes perpendicular to the wind direction , which are called `` transverse dunes '' , arise for a wind blowing steadily from the same direction .",
    "ensembles of transverse dunes , with crest to crest distances ranging from a few meters to over 3 km , are found to cover about 40% of all terrestrial sand seas , being common in the northern hemisphere @xcite , and also dominating the sand landscape on mars @xcite .",
    "the last few years have seen an increasing interest in the investigation of the geomorphological aspects and the evolution of transverse dunes @xcite . in spite of this effort ,",
    "very little is known about these dunes , and several phenomena are still not well understood , as for example the effect of coalescence between dunes with different velocities @xcite .",
    "this work reports on a simple one - dimensional model for the evolution of transverse dunes in a field , which reproduces the observation that these dunes have generally the same height and velocity of propagation .",
    "this is independent on the initial configuration of the field and on coalescence effects between close dunes with different velocities . in our model",
    "each dune is considered to have zero width and infinite length , but a variable height , which determines the associated propagation velocity and that also controls the interaction between neighbouring dunes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", the model is presented ; the results for both cases with and without coalescence are discussed in section 3 ; conclusions are made in section 4 .",
    "we consider a set of @xmath0 dunes distributed along the @xmath1 axis , each one with a variable height @xmath2 , but zero width .",
    "the dunes are allowed to move in the @xmath1 direction with a velocity @xmath3 given by : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the position of the @xmath6th dune , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is a constant phenomenological parameter that contains information about the wind speed , the grain size , etc .",
    "the behavior of the sand flux on a dune field is crucial to the evolution of the field dynamics , as interactions between dunes strongly depend on the sand transport among them . for a dune that migrates shape invariantly through sand avalanches on its slip face , the sand flux @xmath9 over the dune behaves as @xmath10constant , where @xmath11 is the height profile of the dune . for the model studied in this paper",
    ", we consider the height @xmath2 of the dune at the position of the crest , and set for the @xmath6th dune : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is our second phenomenological parameter , again depending on wind speed , grain size , etc .",
    "note that equation ( [ eq : phi ] ) means that the rate of sand transport over the crest is larger for the bigger dunes than for the smaller ones . as a consequence , exchange of sand",
    "is expected between neighbouring dunes with different heights , as a bigger dune tends to loose sand more rapidly than a smaller one .    to model the inter - dune interaction ,",
    "we first observe that for a two - dimensional slice of a dune , the mass of sand in the dune , or equivalently , its area @xmath14 , increases with the height of the dune as @xmath15 . on the other hand ,",
    "the amount of sand transported depends on the difference between the sand fluxes on the crests of the neighbouring dunes , i.e. if @xmath16 is the volume change for the @xmath6th dune during a time interval @xmath17 , then @xmath18 .",
    "thus , we write : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the third parameter of our model that depends on the shape of the dune , and the last factor on the right side ensures that more sand is transported from the larger dune to the smaller one .",
    "as in a real transverse dune field , we set the sand influx to point in the positive wind ( @xmath1 ) direction and assume it to be constant .",
    "we call the sand influx @xmath21 , which can be seen as an effective dune fixed at the position @xmath22 , with a constant height @xmath23 . equations ( [ eq : v ] ) , ( [ eq : phi ] ) and ( [ eq : dh / dt ] ) are repeatedly iterated , which gives the time evolution of the dune field .",
    "we studied the evolution of a set of @xmath0 dunes with initial positions @xmath24 and heights @xmath25 , for different configurations with @xmath26 , as shown in figure 1 . in the first group of simulations",
    "( i ) , the dunes are equally spaced along the @xmath1 axis at @xmath27 , and have the same heights @xmath28 ( figure 1(a ) ) . in the second group ( ii ) , we take random values for the heights @xmath25 chosen from a homogeneous distribution between 0 and 1 , but still the dune spacing is regular ( figure 1(b ) ) . and in the third group ( iii ) ,",
    "both the values for the heights and the positions of the dunes along the @xmath1 axis are chosen randomly ( figure 1(c ) ) .",
    "the trajectory of the dunes along the @xmath1 axis and the changes in their heights are shown as a function of the time in figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) respectively , for particular realizations corresponding to each one of the initial states i , ii and iii .",
    "the values of the phenomenological parameters are @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and the sand influx is chosen to be @xmath32m / year @xmath33cm / min . in the simulations , each iteration corresponds to @xmath34 year . as can be seen from these figures , after a certain number of iterations @xmath35 , all dunes reach the same height @xmath36 m , and consequently the same velocity @xmath37m / year , independently on the initial configuration .    in the discussion above",
    ", the distances between the dunes were large enough that their relative order was the same during the whole evolution of the field .",
    "however , if a smaller , faster migrating dune is very closely behind a larger , slower one , they can reach the same position after some finite time .",
    "dune coalescence has been studied for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which a critical distance @xmath38 between two neighbouring dunes was considered , below which they collide and become one single dune . in our one - dimensional model ,",
    "we set @xmath39 . for simplicity , dune coalescence",
    "is implemented here through the emergence of a single dune , with height @xmath40 .",
    "consequently , the number of dunes @xmath0 in the field decreases by unity , whenever two dunes coalesce .",
    "the main plot of figure 3 shows the variable @xmath41 for a set of @xmath42 dunes with random values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath27 .",
    "the values of @xmath21 and of the parameters @xmath8 , @xmath13 and @xmath20 are the same as in figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) , but now their distances in the initial state are much smaller .",
    "the number of dunes as a function of time for the realization in this figure is shown in the upper - left - hand - corner inset .",
    "note that this number decreases monotonically until the last coalescence between dunes has occured , and the final number of dunes , @xmath43 has been reached . as we can see from the bottom - right - hand - corner inset , coalescence of dunes",
    "does nt modify the result that the dunes in the field do all have the same height in the final state .",
    "dunes with positions @xmath24 and heights @xmath25 at @xmath27 . in ( a )",
    "the dunes are equally spaced , and have the same height @xmath44 ( group i ) .",
    "dunes in group ii still have regular spacing but random heights ( b ) , while in group iii , both the positions and heights are random ( c ) . ]",
    "dunes along the @xmath1-axis as function of time , for each of the realizations shown in figure 1 .",
    "the evolution of the heights of the dunes for each case is shown in ( b ) .",

    "see text for details . ]     for a set of @xmath47 dunes with coalescence for the values of the parameters used in figure 2 .",
    "the number of dunes as a function of the time , @xmath48 , is shown in the upper - left - hand - corner inset of this figure . from the bottom - right - hand - corner inset",
    ", we can see that dune coalescence does nt change the fact that all dunes have the same height for @xmath49 . ]    for a given distribution of dunes in the field at @xmath27 , the number @xmath50 of dunes in the final state tends to be larger for smaller values of the parameter @xmath8 , the other parameters @xmath13 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 being fixed .",
    "this is because @xmath8 controls the velocity of the dunes , and coalescence is more frequent in a field with faster dunes . in the same way ,",
    "the closer the dunes are in the initial state , the more they are going to coalesce on average . as an example , we show in figure 4 the behavior of @xmath50 as a function of the length @xmath51 of the system , i.e. the initial distance between the first dune and the last one in the field , for a set having a fixed number of @xmath52 dunes , using the same values of the phenomenological parameters as in figure 1 .",
    "as we can see in this figure , the smaller ( larger ) the value of @xmath51 , the more ( less ) the dunes tend to coalesce .",
    "the statistical error bars are obtained from different realizations of dunes with random heights and positions at time @xmath27 .",

    "the full line corresponds to the fit using the equation @xmath59 $ ] , with @xmath55 and @xmath60 m . ]    in figure 5 , we show for three different values of @xmath51 the corresponding curves @xmath61 , averaged over five realizations of @xmath58 , as a function of time @xmath62 .",
    "the values of @xmath51 shown are @xmath63 m ( circles ) , @xmath64 m ( triangles ) and @xmath65 m ( squares ) .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to a straight line in a linear - log fit to the curve corresponding to @xmath63 m .",
    "we can observe that @xmath61 decays approximately logaritmically with time , independently on @xmath51 .",

    "curves corresponding to averages over different initial realizations of the type iii @xmath67 of a set of @xmath52 dunes , which are let to evolve with coalescence .",
    "the curves correspond to @xmath63 m ( circles ) @xmath64 m ( triangles ) and @xmath65 m ( squares ) , where @xmath51 is the distance between the first dune and the last one in the initial state of the field .",
    "time is plotted on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the dashed straight line is a guide to the eye meant to fit to the curve for @xmath63 m ( circles ) . ]",
    "as all dunes attain the same height @xmath68 for @xmath69 , the time to reach the final state depends on the strength of the sand flux in the field , @xmath21 .",
    "a plot of @xmath70 as a function of @xmath21 for the initial configuration i of figure 1a is presented in figure 6 . as we can see from this figure , @xmath70 scales after a transient interval of variation in @xmath71 : @xmath72",
    "i.e. the closer the value of @xmath21 to @xmath73 , the more rapidly the system will reach the final state . from equation ( [ eq : dh / dt ] )",
    ", we see that the phenomenological parameter @xmath20 controls the rate of sand transport between neighbouring dunes .",
    "we have found that the number of iterations to reach the final state decreases as @xmath74 , which in fact is independent on the initial height @xmath44 of the dunes .     to reach the final state , on the relative sand flux @xmath75 for the initial configuration i shown in figure 1(a ) .",

    "we presented a simple one - dimensional model for a transverse dune field which reproduces the observation that the dunes in a field attain approximately the same heights and velocities .",
    "the fact that our results do not depend on the initial configuration of the field and on the details of coalescence effects between dunes is of particular interest , since the genesis of dune fields is still not understood by geographers and geologists . of course",
