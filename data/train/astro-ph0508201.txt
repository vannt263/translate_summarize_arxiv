    "as primordial density fluctuations grow through gravitational jeans instability within cdm - like models , the web - like distribution of dark matter strongly influences the clustering of baryonic matter on large scales ( @xcite ) .",
    "after the epoch of hydrogen reionization , the hydrogen gas present in this baryonic component is highly ionized , leaving only a small fraction of the gas as neutral atoms in photoionization equilibrium within the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "this distribution of neutral hydrogen is observable as the forest of absorption lines in the spectra of high redshift qsos ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "helium-4 is the second most abundant nuclide in the universe after hydrogen , with a mass fraction of @xmath1 ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . following the onset of reionization , the structures responsible for the absorption seen in the forest should also be observable as discrete absorption lines at the rest - frame wavelength of @xmath2   ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the development of space - based uv - capable observatories in the 1990s led to the first detection of a possible gunn - peterson trough in the spectrum of @xmath3 by @xcite using the faint object camera on the _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_. higher resolution studies of the same spectrum using the goddard high resolution spectrograph and the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on the _ hst _ , as well as spectral observations of @xmath4 @xmath5 using the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ , have all demonstrated a strong correlation between resolved absorption features and those seen in the forest , confirming theoretical predictions .",
    "absorption from in the igm has so far been detected in six qso spectra ; @xmath6 @xmath7 , ( @xcite ) , @xmath8 @xmath9 , ( @xcite ) @xmath4 @xmath5 , ( @xcite ) , @xmath10 @xmath11 , ( @xcite ) , @xmath3 ( @xcite ) and most recently @xmath8 @xmath12 , ( @xcite ) . the higher redshift absorption measurements ( @xmath13 ) exhibit a patchy distribution , with regions of high opacity interspersed by voids .",
    "this observation , coupled with the steady decline in the opacity at lower redshift , along with measurements of the igm temperature ( @xcite ) , the evolution of the forest effective optical depth ( @xcite ) and measurements of the c  @xmath14/si  @xmath15 ratio ( @xcite ) , has led to the suggestion that the final stages of the reionization epoch may have occurred around @xmath16 .    in tandem with the observations ,",
    "detailed models of the igm have been developed to examine the forest from a theoretical perspective ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the forest is of particular interest as it is a sensitive probe of the low density igm ( @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , the ratio of to column densities , @xmath17 , provides a constraint on the spectrum of the metagalactic uv background ( uvb ) between @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath19 .",
    "measurements of @xmath21 indicate a wide spread of values , from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , implying that the metagalactic radiation field exhibits inhomogeneities at the scale of @xmath24 mpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is also some evidence for an anti - correlation between @xmath21 and the density of the absorbers ( @xcite ) .",
    "semi - analytical models ( @xcite ) suggest that a soft uvb with a significant stellar contribution is required to reproduce the high opacity regions ( @xmath25 ) , while the observed opacity gaps ( @xmath26 have been attributed to hard sources near the line - of - sight creating pockets of highly ionized helium .",
    "the small - scale variations in @xmath21 could also be attributed to a spread in qso spectral indices ( @xcite ) , local density variations ( @xcite ) , finite qso lifetimes ( @xcite ) , intrinsic absorption within the nuclei of active galaxies ( @xcite ) or the filtering of qso radiation by radiative transfer effects ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the exact nature of these fluctuations and their interpretation is unclear .    in this paper",
    "we use realistic and forest spectra , constructed from state - of - the - art hydrodynamical simulations of a universe , to test the reliability of using line profile fitting techniques to infer the uvb softness parameter , defined as the ratio of the and metagalactic ionization rates , @xmath27 .",
    "we obtain improved estimates of the uvb softness parameter and its uncertainty using published estimates of the and forest opacity .",
    "we concentrate on the redshift range @xmath28 where the fluctuations of the mean opacity are still moderate and reionization is probably mostly complete . finally , we make a detailed comparison between the observed fluctuations in the column density ratios of corresponding and absorption features measured by @xcite ( hereinafter z04b ) and those expected due to fluctuations in a metagalactic ionization field dominated by emission from qsos and hot gas in collapsed haloes ( @xcite ) respectively",
    ".    the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the method we use for obtaining the uvb softness parameter from our simulations is described in section @xmath29 . in section",
    "@xmath30 we present a simple model for uvb fluctuations .",
    "we discuss our line profile fitting method and compare the uvb softness parameter inferred directly from our simulations to the value obtained from the column density ratio @xmath21 in section @xmath31 . in section",
    "@xmath32 we explore the effect of uvb fluctuations on the measured column density ratio .",
    "our constraints on the uvb softness parameter are given in section @xmath33 , along with a discussion of implications for the sources which contribute to the uvb .",
    "we summarise and conclude in section @xmath34 .",
    ".simulations used for our resolution and box size study . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , the uncertainty in the adopted values for @xmath35 and @xmath36 must be considered .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in @xmath35 by binning the 1@xmath37 measurement errors of @xcite as described in section @xmath38 .",
    "we use the error bars shown in figure  [ fig : tau ] to estimate the uncertainty in our assumption for the effective optical depth .",
    "these have been computed using the fluctuating uvb model due to qsos described in section  [ sec : toymodel ] ; the lower and upper error bars correspond to the @xmath39 and @xmath40 percentiles of @xmath41 taken from each set of @xmath42 spectra at the relevant redshift .",
    "an additional uncertainty of @xmath43 per cent is added to take into account the marginal convergence of the simulations . the final error budget for @xmath44 at @xmath45 $ ] is summarised in table  [ tab : errors ] .",
    "the dominant uncertainty is the measurement of the effective optical depth .      in figure",
    "[ fig : softness ] we compare the results of our analysis of the average softness parameter inferred from observed and effective optical depths with the uvb model of madau et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ( hereinafter mhr99 ) and other observational estimates of @xmath44 .",
    "the dotted and dashed curves show the softness parameter of the updated uvb models of mhr99 ( see @xcite for a detailed description ) for qsos alone and qsos plus young star forming galaxies ( ysfgs ) .",
    "typically @xmath46 for qso dominated uvb models ( @xcite ) , although if there is a wide range in qso spectral indices a qso dominated uvb could be as soft as @xmath47 ( @xcite ) .",
    "due to their softer spectra , ysfgs only provide a significant boost to the uvb amplitude at the photoelectric edge , so that typically one expects @xmath48 for a uvb with contributions from qsos and ysfgs .",
    "our results for the spatially uniform uvb model agree very well with the softness parameter of the updated mhr99 model with contributions from qsos and ysfgs . at the lowest redshift @xmath49",
    "there is some indication that the mhr99 model may slightly overpredict the softness parameter .",
    "note that the mhr99 uvb model also assumes a spatially uniform background , allowing a fair comparison .",
    "our analysis thus adds to the growing evidence that the amplitude of the uvb at the photoelectric edge can not be accounted for by qso emissivities alone ; a substantial contribution from ysfgs seems to be required ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "note , however , that as discussed before , uv fluctuations will play a significant role in altering @xmath44 on local scales , especially at @xmath50 .",
    "some regions of low opacity are obviously subject to a harder ionizing radiation field , producing values of @xmath44 outside our error range .",
    "similarly , overdense regions which are optically thick to ionizing photons can be subject to a softer radiation field .",
    "the spatial fluctuations also affect the average ionization rate and thus the inferred average softness parameter .",
    "the dot - dashed curve in figure  [ fig : softness ] shows the average softness parameter obtained from our model of a spatially fluctuating uvb due to qso emission .",
    "the average softness parameter inferred for the spatially fluctuating ionization rate is systematically smaller ( @xmath51 dex ) than that obtained for a spatially uniform uvb .",
    "this is because in regions close to qsos , corresponding to voids in the forest , raising the ionization rate further will not decrease the effective optical depth to a great extent once the local optical depth is already low . the average ionization rate will thus be biased low if a uniform background is assumed .",
    "this effect is also found for uvb fluctuations at the hydrogen ionization edge ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "we also plot the data of z04b and @xcite in figure  [ fig : softness ] .",
    "the logarithmic mean of the softness parameter calculated from the z04b column density measurements is shown by the filled circles with error bars .",
    "the median value in each bin is indicated with an open square .",
    "we have only used data where both the and components have measured column densities ; the analysis of our artificial spectra using voigt profile fitting indicates that these measurements should recover the uvb spectral shape well for the line - of - sight considered , with the median providing a better estimate of @xmath44 .",
    "the results of z04b agree very well with our analysis for a fluctuating ionization rate .",
    "note that the results of z04b can not be compared directly to the predictions of the mhr99 model which assumes a spatially uniform uvb .",
    "we have used state - of the art hydrodynamical simulations to obtain improved measurements of the spectral shape of the ionizing uv background from the and forest and to investigate the origin of the large spatial fluctuations observed in the to column density ratio .    using artificial absorption spectra",
    "we have shown that the softness parameter of the uv background can be accurately inferred from the column density ratio of and absorption lines obtained by applying standard voigt profile fitting routines .",
    "uncertainties in the identification of corresponding and absorption and errors in the determination of the column densities contribute little to the large fluctuations observed in the and column density ratio , although one should be cautious of extreme values of @xmath21 .",
    "these fluctuations must be due to genuine spatial variations in the spectral shape of the uvb . a model where the ionization rate fluctuates due to variation in the number , luminosity and spectral shape of a small number of qsos reproduces the observed spatial variations of the and column density ratio , as well as the observed anti - correlation of the column density ratio with the density .",
    "this is in good agreement with previous suggestions that the observed forest spectra at @xmath0 probes the tail end of the reionization of by qsos .",
    "the large fluctuations observed in the and column density ratio argue strongly against a significant contribution of emission by hot gas to the ionization rate at @xmath28 .",
    "we further obtain new constraints and error estimates for the mean softness parameter of the uvb and its evolution using the observed effective optical depth of the and forest .",
    "we find that the inferred softness parameter is consistent with a uvb with contributions from qsos and ysfgs within our uncertainties .",
    "the dominant contribution to the uncertainty on @xmath44 comes from the effective optical depth .",
    "our results for the mean softness parameter add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that a uvb dominated by emission from qsos alone can not reproduce the observed effective optical depth of the forest in qso spectra .",
