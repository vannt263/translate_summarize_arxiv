    "an extremely useful mathematical framework for dealing with continuous symmetries is the theory of lie groups and lie algebras . in the context of quantum optics ,",
    "the use of group theory has been very prominent ever since the discovery of the coherent states of electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "the usual coherent states are the unitarily displaced vacuum state of the harmonic oscillator . the unitary displacement is effected by the displacement operator @xmath2 given by @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 being the creation and annihilation operators respectively .",
    "each coherent state is characterized by a complex number @xmath6 and the state is expressed in terms of the fock ( number ) states as @xmath7 the algebra relevant to these states is the heisenberg - weyl algebra @xmath1 , generated by the operators @xmath5 , @xmath4 and the identity operator @xmath8 .",
    "these three operators form a closed algebra as @xmath9=i$ ] .",
    "( the heisenberg - weyl algebra can be extended to @xmath10 by including the number operator @xmath11 and the algebra is still closed . )",
    "it turns out that the states @xmath12 are eigenstates of @xmath5 , one of the elements of the algebra .",
    "such eigenstates are algebraic coherent states .",
    "states obtained , as in eq.([cseqn ] ) , by an unitary transformation are said to be group - theoretic coherent states or coherent states in the sense of perelomov .",
    "the most notable feature of coherent states is their overcompleteness and it is mathematically expressed as @xmath13 the integration is over the entire complex plane and the integration measure @xmath14 is @xmath15 .    the two - photon operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 and the number operator @xmath11 form a closed algebra which is idential to the well - known su(1,1 ) algebra of three operators @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 which satisfy @xmath21=\\pm k_{\\pm } \\hspace{1 in } [ k_+,k_-]=-2k_0.\\ ] ] in the case of two - photon operators , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are identified with @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "the algebraic coherent states for this realization are the even and odd coherent states @xcite .",
    "the group - theoretic coherent are the squeezed vacuum and first excited states@xcite .",
    "it is , however , possible to realize su(1,1 ) algebra with deformed single - photon operators @xcite . here",
    ", deformation implies that the generators are multiplied by an operator - valued function of the number operator .",
    "consider the holstein - primakoff realization @xmath25 the deforming operator is @xmath26 .",
    "the casimir invariant for this realization is @xmath27 .",
    "the operator realizations indeed satisfy the su(1,1 ) algebra for all values of @xmath28 , but they are not two - photon operators . here",
    "@xmath28 is a constant and we set it equal to @xmath29 in the following discussion .",
    "the algebraic coherent states , defined as the eigenstates of @xmath20 , for this realization are @xmath30 the normalization constant @xmath31 is @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the bessel function of second kind of order zero @xcite .",
    "these coherent states correspond to the `` discrete '' representation where the parameter @xmath28 is 1/2 .",
    "in general , @xmath28 can be either integer or half - integer for discrete representation .",
    "eigenstates of deformed annihilation operators are termed `` nonlinear coherent states '' as they can be thought of as the coherent states of an oscillator with energy - dependent frequency@xcite .",
    "the group - theoretic coherent states are constructed as @xmath34 the parameter @xmath35 is a function of @xmath36 and the relation is @xmath37 .",
    "the two realizations of su(1,1 ) algebra , one in terms of two - photon operators and another in terms of deformed single - photon operators , are useful in solving the intensity - dependent jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) @xcite . the two - photon realization of su(1,1 )",
    "algebra is relevant if the interaction between a single - mode cavity field and a two - level atom is described by @xmath38 the operators @xmath39 are the raising and lowering operators for the two levels of the atom . for holstein - primikoff realization ( with @xmath40 ) , the relevant interaction is @xmath41 the interaction describes single - photon processes with nonlinear coupling between the atom and the field .",
    "the later case has been extensively studied in the context of jcm which exhibits complete periodicity in population inversion of atomic levels and fields with infinite statistics @xcite .",
    "a more general case of interaction is @xmath42 in the absence of nonlinear coupling , obtained by setting @xmath43 , this hamiltonian describes the usual jcm . in the following section we consider operators which are relevant for the hamiltonian given in eq.([jcmk ] ) . in the next section",
    ", it is shown that the operators satisfy the @xmath1 or su(1,1 ) algebra depending on whether @xmath44 is zero or unity .",
    "we construct coherent states for the algebra satisfied by the operators in the above hamiltonian and study the properties of the states as a function of @xmath44 .",
    "the overcompleteness of the states are proven for both the algebraic and group - theoretic coherent states .",
    "properties such as energy fluctuations , quadrature squeezing are studied . in section iii",
    ", we introduce nonsymmetric set of operators to realize @xmath1 algebra and study the relevant coherent states .",
    "we introduce an additional parameter @xmath44 ( nonnegative and less than or equal to unity ) in the symmetric set of operators defined in eq . ( [ su11 ] )",
    "such that the su(1,1 ) realization is obtained when @xmath45 .",
    "the symmetric set of operators is @xmath46 these operators are closed under commutation , and we have @xmath47=\\pm k a_{\\pm } \\hspace{1 in } [ a_+,a_-]=-2a_0.\\ ] ] the casimir invariant of this closed algebra is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 stands for anticomutation of the two operators .",
    "successive eigenvalues of the casimir operator differ by @xmath44 .",
    "two important limiting cases of the above commutation relations are when @xmath44 takes the values zero and unity respectively . in the former case",
    ", the algebra reduces to the heisenberg - weyl algebra @xmath1 and in the later case it becomes the su(1,1 ) algebra .",
    "thus , the algebra can be thought of as interpolating between the su(1,1 ) and @xmath1 algebras .",
    "the fact that one algebra can be obtained from another algebra is known as `` contraction '' and the procedure to go from su(1,1 ) to @xmath1 is known@xcite .",
    "what we have presented here is a _ realization _ of an algebra which has @xmath1 and su(1,1 ) as the limiting cases .",
    "the algebraic coherent states for the algebra are defined by @xmath50 and the number state expansion is @xmath51 the states are normalizable for all values of @xmath6 and the normalization constant @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 the symbol @xmath54 is pochammer notation for the product @xmath55 and @xmath56@xcite . as expected , in the limit of @xmath44 becoming zero the states @xmath57 become the usual coherent states @xmath12 .",
    "now , we prove the completeness relation for the states @xmath58 @xmath59 . when @xmath43 the states are the usual coherent states and they are overcomplete ( refer eq.[cscomplete ] ) .",
    "we need to show that @xmath60 for some suitable integration measure @xmath61 .",
    "this problem naturally leads to the _ problem of moments _ wherein it is required to construct a probability distribution from the knowledge of its moments@xcite . substituting the number state expansion in eq.([alcohex ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ alcohoc ] ) , the lhs of the later equation becomes @xmath62 on substituting @xmath63 and setting @xmath64 , the completeness relation becomes @xmath65 for the equation to be valid , the condition is @xmath66 with @xmath67 .    by comparing with the standard formula @xcite @xmath68",
    "we infer @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the modified bessel function of order @xmath71@xcite .",
    "thus , the states @xmath57 provide a resolution of identity .",
    "the inner product between two states , say @xmath57 and @xmath72 , is @xmath73 the states corresponding to two different values of @xmath6 are not orthogonal and hence the states @xmath57 are overcomplete .",
    "the uniqueness of the weight function @xmath74 is guaranteed if the moments @xmath75 @xmath76 satisfy the sufficient condition @xmath77 for the present case the moments are given by eq.([moments ] ) and they satisfy the sufficient condition .",
    "therefore , the weight function @xmath74 is unique .",
    "recently , a variety of coherent states have been constructed based on the solution of moments problem using the tabulated inverse mellin transforms@xcite .",
    "any harmonic oscillator state @xmath78 can be expanded in terms of the overcomplete set of states @xmath57 as @xmath79 the function @xmath80 is @xmath81 , the projection of the state @xmath78 on the eigenstates of @xmath82 . in the space of functions @xmath83 ,",
    "the generators @xmath82 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are represented as @xmath86    the two limiting cases of @xmath57 are the coherent states @xmath12 and the states @xmath87 corresponding to @xmath44 becoming zero and unity respectively .",
    "thus , the states corresponding to other values of @xmath44 interpolate between the two limiting cases .",
    "the term `` interpolating states '' seems appropriate as the properties of the states are intermediate between those of the limiting cases .",
    "for instance , the coherent states are poissonian , meaning that the variance and mean of the number distribution are equal .",
    "the single - photon su(1,1 ) coherent states are sub - poissonian , _",
    "i.e. _ , the variance is less than the mean for their number distribution .",
    "the states corresponding to arbitrary @xmath44 ( @xmath88 ) are also sub - poissonian . a quantitative measure for the deviation from poissonian behaviour is the @xmath89 parameter@xcite , defined as @xmath90 in fig .",
    "1 the variation of @xmath89 as a function of @xmath44 is shown as a function of @xmath91 for different values of @xmath44 .",
    "the states @xmath57 are sub - poissoanin for @xmath92 .",
    "the algebraic coherent states exhibit squeezing in both the field quadratures , namely , @xmath93 for the coherent states @xmath12 the uncertainties in @xmath94 and @xmath95 are same as those of the vacuum state . in the case of @xmath57 ,",
    "the squeezing in the @xmath94 quadrature increases with both @xmath6 and @xmath44 .",
    "the dependence is depicted in figs .",
    "2a-2d where the variation of @xmath96 with @xmath6 is shown for various values of @xmath44 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the uncertainty profiles are symmetric under @xmath97 .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the symbol @xmath98 stands for the expectation value in the states @xmath57 . in terms of the operators @xmath5 and @xmath4 , the uncertainty in @xmath94 is @xmath99 and that in @xmath95 is @xmath100 when @xmath101 , where @xmath102 , we have @xmath103 and @xmath104 the transformation @xmath97 corresponds to @xmath105 .",
    "substituting in eqs .",
    "[ delx]-[delp ] the transformed expressions for the expectation values of @xmath5 , @xmath4 and @xmath11 and setting @xmath105 , we see that the uncertainties in @xmath94 and @xmath95 for the state @xmath106 are same as those of the state @xmath107 .",
    "thus , the quadrature uncertainties for the states defined on the upper - half of the @xmath6-plane yield contain the values for the states defined on the lower - half also .",
    "another interesting transformation is @xmath108 , which corresponds to rotation by @xmath109 . under this transformation",
    "the expression for @xmath110 for the state @xmath57 goes over to that of @xmath111 for the state @xmath112 .",
    "the discussion implies that the knowledge of variance in one of the quadratures for all values of @xmath6 gives also the magnitude of the fluctuation in the other quadrature .",
    "the uncertainty profile for the @xmath95-quadrature is same as that of the @xmath94 , except for a rotation of @xmath109 about the axis labeled @xmath96 .",
    "the symmetries exhibited in the uncertainty profiles are not restricted to the states @xmath57 .",
    "they are generic to any state @xmath113 , characterized by a complex number @xmath6 , which has the number state expansion @xmath114 the coefficients @xmath115 are real .",
    "the states @xmath57 are nonclassical as they exhibit squeezing in the quadratures and exhibit sub - poissonian photon statistics .",
    "hence the wigner function should become negative somewhere on the complex plane .",
    "the wigner function , obtained using the method given in ref .",
    "@xcite , is given by @xmath116 we have plotted the wigner function for the state @xmath117 which exhibits squeezing in @xmath94 quadrature ( see fig .",
    "as expected , there are valleys of negative values of the wigner function .      the group - theoretic coherent states for the algebra of operators defined in eq.([gensu11 ] )",
    "are constructed by the action of the unitary operator @xmath118 on the vacuum state @xmath119 . denoting these states as @xmath120 , where the suffix @xmath95 stands for `` perelomov state ''",
    ", we have @xmath121 to get the number state expansion for the rhs of the above equation , we use the following disentangled form , derived using the method described in @xcite , for the unitary operator , @xmath122,\\nonumber\\\\ \\delta & = & -\\beta^*.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above expressions , @xmath123 and @xmath124 are respectively the modulus and argument of @xmath6 . in the limit of @xmath125 ,",
    "the above expression reduces to the familar form @xmath126 .    the disentangled form of @xmath118 , as given eq . ( [ disent ] ) , gives the number state expansion @xmath127 the states are normalizable for all values of @xmath6 as @xmath128 for any @xmath6 .",
    "the disentangled form implies that the states can as well be obtained by the action of @xmath129 on the vacuum state @xmath130 and normalizing the resultant state .",
    "of course , this is possible only for the vacuum state as @xmath82 annihilates the vacuum and @xmath131 introduces an overall phase . in the limit of @xmath132 ,",
    "the states become the well known phase states@xcite .",
    "the inner product of @xmath133 with @xmath134 is @xmath135^{1\\over 2k } ( 1-k\\beta^*\\beta')^{-{1\\over k}}.\\ ] ] the resolution of identity by the states @xmath120 is written as @xmath136 the range of integration is restricted to a disc of radius @xmath137 in the complex @xmath138-plane .",
    "if we use the relation @xmath139 , the finite range of integration in the @xmath138-plane goes over to integration over the entire @xmath6-plane .",
    "the resolution of identity enables us to write an arbitrary state @xmath78 in terms of @xmath140 as @xmath141 in which we have used the definition @xmath142 . in the space of @xmath143 , the operators of the algebra are    @xmath144    in the limit of @xmath125 , the differential operator realizations of the interpolating algebra in the respective spaces , namely hilbert space of composed of functions @xmath145 and @xmath146 , yield @xmath147 and @xmath148 and @xmath149",
    "this is to be expected as the algebraic and group - theoretic coherent states are the same in the limit of vanishing @xmath44 .",
    "the representation space contains the entire functions @xmath150 .",
    "the group - theoretic coherent states are always super - poissonian ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "we have shown in fig .",
    "4 the @xmath6-dependence of the @xmath89 parameter .",
    "quadrature squeezing has also been studied for these states .",
    "as the states @xmath152",
    "are normalizable only for @xmath153 , we have studied the squeezing for @xmath138 lying within the unit circle .",
    "the figures 5a-5d give the uncertainty in @xmath94 as a function of @xmath138 for @xmath154 respectively . as in the case of algebraic coherent states @xmath57 , the uncertainty profiles exhibit symmetry when @xmath97 .",
    "also , the corresponding profiles for @xmath95 can be obtained by rotating the figures 5a-5d by @xmath109 about the @xmath155-axis .",
