    "the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in fe - based materials attaining t@xmath6 as large as 109k @xcite , has lead to a huge up surge of research for further discovery of such new materials @xcite .",
    "seven years after its discovery , while a clear consensus on the mechanism of superconductivity has not yet been reached , understanding on the structural , magnetic transitions and their mutual influences on superconductivity remain central issue of frontier research @xcite .",
    "a large number of undoped fe - based materials show spin density wave ( sdw ) magnetic state whose transition temperature coincides with that of the structural transition ( which gets separated through doping as well as pressure ) .",
    "both the transitions being second order in nature , can have a conflict with landau theory of phase transition unless there would be a precursor transition at higher temperatures . according to landau theory , occurrence of two simultaneous transitions",
    "may be purely coincidental , mutually independent , or one of the transitions be first order type or there must be a precursor to one of the transitions at a higher temperature .",
    "what is that precursor ?",
    "origin of the structural transition is not purely lattice driven but an electronic one ; the orbital ordering of fe d@xmath0 and d@xmath1 orbitals @xcite is the primary reason for structural transition . among some of the normal state properties ,",
    "transport in `` preferred '' direction has been observed unambiguously in many experiments ",
    "inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) @xcite , scanning tunnelling microscope , impurity @xcite , resistivity @xcite , optical conductivity @xcite , angle resolved photo electron spectroscopy @xcite and so on .",
    "overall , origin of such phenomena is related to the breaking of four - fold rotational ( c@xmath7 ) symmetry of the tetragonal phase known as nematicity  the precursor . whether the origin of nematic phase is spin driven or orbital driven",
    "is far from being settled .",
    "the nematic phase is observed in fese materials , that has structural transition at 90 k but no trace of long - range magnetic order @xcite indicating nematicity is orbital fluctuation driven @xcite .",
    "however , observation of an additional c@xmath7 phase deep inside the orthorhombic ( c@xmath8 ) phase in ba@xmath9na@xmath10fe@xmath8as@xmath8 close to the suppression of magnetic spin density wave ( sdw ) order favours magnetically driven nematic order @xcite .",
    "role of nematic phase as regards to the mechanism of superconductivity or symmetry of cooper pair wave function is not straight forward @xcite but the fact that spin fluctuation leads to s@xmath11 superconductivity @xcite whereas the orbital fluctuation leads to s@xmath12 superconductivity in fe - pnictides @xcite are established and magnetism competes with superconductivity @xcite .",
    "there are also evidences of nematic order in the pseudogap phase of the other class of high temperature cuprates superconductors which are known to be strongly correlated materials @xcite . on the other hand , 122 family of fe - based superconductors",
    "are generally considered as weakly correlated systems .",
    "therefore , the study of nematicity in fe - based superconductors is of fundamental importance .",
    "possible origins of nematic phase are well described in @xcite as ( a ) structural distortion , ( b ) charge / orbital order , ( c ) spin order . whatever be the nematic order parameter it must couple linearly to the orthorhombic distortion @xcite .",
    "nematicity introduces electronic anisotropy leading to two different nesting vectors which in turn leads to two competing spin density wave ( sdw ) instabilities ( z@xmath13 o(3 ) symmetry breaking ) @xcite .",
    "coupling of the orbital order to sdw and vice versa has been used as inputs in ginzburg - landau formalism which provides qualitative understanding of nematic phase . a clear first principles understanding on whether there is any direct coupling between the magnetic ( sdw ) and orbital order in fe - pnictides is absent till to date",
    " is the main aim of this work .",
    "we show through electronic structure calculation that the electronic orbital ordering locally breaks the in - plane symmetry and generate two non - equivalent @xmath2 , @xmath3 directions .",
    "in particular , we show that below structural transition ( orthorhombic phase ) there is a strong orbital anisotropy along the @xmath14 and @xmath15 polarizations ; the band at x is dominantly fe - d@xmath0 derived whereas that at y , fe - d@xmath1 derived respectively .",
    "this feature reproduces correctly experimental angle resolved photo electron spectroscopy ( arpes ) observation @xcite .",
    "this is the root cause of orbital ordering in bafe@xmath16ru@xmath10as@xmath8  we show that the temperature dependence of the orbital ordering at x(y ) point reproduces exactly that of orthorhombicity parameter ( hence structural transition ) . thus structural transition is primarily electronic in origin and phonons can not be a primary order parameter for nematicity . whereas the temperature dependence of the same at @xmath17 point is very weak ( nearly independent of temperature )",
    "as observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "interestingly , zhang et al . , @xcite observed that the orbital splitting ( ordering ) at @xmath17 point ( in case of fese ) persists beyond structural transition temperature and argued that as against ferro - orbital ordering . in order to have a complementary first principles understanding over the experimental and other studies @xcite we introduce magnetic interaction through tuning integrated spin density defined as , i@xmath18=@xmath19(n@xmath20 ( r ) -n@xmath21 ( r))d@xmath22r . in presence of finite integrated spin density i@xmath18 , spin selective orbital ordering",
    "are observed .",
    "due to electronic orbital anisotropy ( see fig . [ bs ] ) the sdw state may be viewed as a superposition of two sdw states .",
    "this is because of two reasons , ( i ) nesting wave vector that connects nested parts of fermi arcs along the @xmath23 and @xmath24 directions are different ; ( ii ) overlap of fe - d@xmath25 with d@xmath1 and d@xmath0 is different ( below structural transition ) causing anisotropic charge and spin density fluctuations . tuning i@xmath18 causes further perturbation to the underlying sdw as well as splits the spin degeneracy of energy bands .",
    "this magnetic interaction couple with orbital ( charge ) fluctuations causing further orbital anisotropy .",
    "remarkably , this later effect is observable only in the orthorhombic phase and _ not _ in the tetragonal phase",
    ". this would be experimentally verifiable by arpes in presence of weak zeeman field . in presence of i@xmath18",
    "we evaluate thermal variations of orbital ordering at different high symmetry points .",
    "we show that the magnetic interaction couples to the zone centre orbital ordering very strongly where as it has a substantial effect on the corner zone orbital fluctuation .",
    "these observations support the claim by zhang @xcite , fernandes @xcite of magnetic origin of nematic phase .",
    "finally , we show that the orbital occupancies of all the five d - orbitals of fe show temperature dependencies below structural transition .",
    "this indicates to the fact that nematic order parameter may not simply be defined as ( n@xmath4-n@xmath5 ) but charge fluctuations from other orbitals also need to be considered , for example , the thermal variation of ( n@xmath4-n@xmath5)+(n@xmath26-n@xmath27 ) also follows orthorhombicity ( see inset fig .",

    "this will put constraints on many theoretical and experimental works so far .",
    "first principles density functional theories can produce exact solutions of the many electron schrdinger equation if exact electronic density is being used as input .",
    "various modern x - ray diffraction techniques _",
    "e.g_. , synchrotrons radiation source etc . that determines crystallographic information at different external perturbations are essentially result of diffraction from various atomic charge densities ( bragg s diffraction ) .",
    "considering experimentally determined structural parameters at different temperatures as input thus in turn provides temperature dependent densities in our first principles calculation .",
    "these input structural parameters are kept fixed through out the calculation for a fixed temperature .",

    "the main effect on the electronic structure from finite temperature is the underlying crystal structure , and the average crystal structure at finite temperature can usually be reliably determined from the diffraction experiment at a given temperature .",
    "this method is somewhat superior to other similar methodology , like molecular dynamics simulation ( md ) . through md simulation",
    "one finds temperature dependent lattice parameters and then use standard t=0 dft method using gga exchange potential ( see for example , @xcite ) .",

    "one of the shortcomings of the density functional theory ( dft ) under generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for calculating electronic structures of fe - based scs is that it fails to reproduce accurate experimental z@xmath33 @xcite .",
    "this conflict arises due to strong magnetic fluctuation associated with fe based compounds @xcite .",

    "we simulate electronic structures for both the phases , low temperature orthorhombic phase with anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) as well as spin density wave ( sdw ) ordering and high temperature paramagnetic tetragonal phase .",
    "in low temperature orthorhombic phase , along with non magnetic structures various spin configurations have been employed among which the lowest energy configuration is considered for electronic structure calculation .",

    "super - cell method is a computationally expensive method adopted to mimic finite percentage of doping at a particular site .",
    "let s say e.g , for 5% doping at the fe site one needs to build a super - cell ( bigger unit cell ) that contains 20 fe atoms ; then 1 of the fe atoms are replaced by ru atom ( say ) . in the present case",
    "however , a super - cell containing 16 fe atoms ( total 40 atoms ) are taken out of which one is replaced by a ru ( shown in fig.[sc ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to 6% ru doping which is close to the experimental situation .",

    "therefore , lifting of degeneracy of the d@xmath1 , d@xmath0 bands at the @xmath17 and x points , as the temperature is lowered below structural transition temperature is a consequence of the fact that their occupation probabilities become different ( _ i.e _ , partial densities become unequal ) .",

    "furthermore , both the structural and magnetic transitions are 2nd order in nature in case of underdoped ru-122 system .",
    "therefore , study of temperature dependence of orbital fluctuation from first principles is of genuine interest . in fig.[oosc ] orbital occupancies of d@xmath1 orbital ( n@xmath4 ) modifies significantly with temperature compared to the other d orbitals specially d@xmath0 and d@xmath25 ( but they also do show substantial temperature dependence ) .",

    "the nematic order essentially grow as orbital order which is responsible for orthorhombic transition .",
    "therefore , this result may be interpreted as the first principles evidence of the fact that if orbital fluctuation is the primary order responsible for nematicity , then it is proportional to the orthorhombicity parameter @xcite .",
    "this is one of the inputs of all the theories involving ginzburg landau formalism . as already mentioned towards the end of theoretical method section that the method of calculation of occupation probabilities of u effected orbitals remains same as that of the ref .",

    "this method is a simple extension of standard lsda formalism where total energy as a function of moment can be obtained .",

    "almost all the d - orbitals show substantial charge fluctuations in the orthrhombic phase , indicating that the actual definition of nematic order parameter may be more complicated . the nematic order parameter is found to show temperature dependence close to the onset of magnetic fluctuation , obtained rigorously through evaluation of stoner factor . when magnetic fluctuations are enhanced , the orbital fluctuations are also enhanced and vice versa establishing their couplings .",
    "spin - polarised orbital ordering revealed from this work would be experimentally observable .",
