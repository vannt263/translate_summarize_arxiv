    "dwarf galaxies are the most numerous constituents in the universe and outnumber giant galaxies . in the prevailing hierarchical structure formation scenario ( e.g. , white & rees 1978 ; white & frenk 1991 ) , they play key roles as building blocks from which larger structures such as giant galaxies are formed .",
    "although most dwarf galaxies contain old stellar populations ( grebel 2000 ; grebel & gallagher 2004 ) , a general trend occurs in the evolution of galaxies in that more massive galaxies are formed at higher redshifts which is known as the `` downsizing '' effect ( cowie et al .",
    "1996 ; smail et al .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate how they evolved over the age of the universe .",
    "extensive and epoch - making observations of local group dwarf galaxies using the hubble space telescope ( hst ) markedly improved our knowledge of their evolutionary process .",
    "these observations have revealed their intriguing star - formation histories , which has been succinctly summarized as `` no two local group dwarfs have the same star - formation history '' ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "however , the achilles heel of hst is its small field of view . in the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy , coleman et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2005 ) found `` lobed '' substructures , which are suggested to represent a disrupted merging companion dwarf galaxy located at @xmath7 core radii from the center and outside the tidal radius .",
    "evidence for the existence of substructures is also suggested by both photometric and dynamical analyses for ursa minor ( kleyna et al .",
    "1998 ; wilkinson et al . 2004 ) , draco ( wilkinson et al . 2004 ) , and sextans ( kleyna et al . 2004 ; walker et al . 2006 ) .",
    "extended halo structures are also found in several close companion dwarf spheroidals of the milky way ( ursa minor , palma et al .",
    "2003 ; carina , majewski et al . 2005 ; sculptor , westfall et al .",
    "2006 ) , and their origin is often related to the tidal influence of the milky way . regarding stellar populations , da costa et al .",
    "( 1996 ) first pointed out that leo  ii , and  i and sculptor show a significant radial gradient in hb morphology . since then many dwarf spheroidal galaxies have been reported to show radial gradients of stellar populations in the sense of a central concentration of young and metal - rich populations versus more extended metal - poor and old populations ( martnez - delgado , gallart & aparicio 1999 ; saviane , held & bertelli 2000 ; harbeck et al . 2001 ; tolstoy et al .",
    "2004 ) . however , some exceptions exist , such as leo  i ( held et al .",
    "2000 ) and carina ( smecker - hane et al .",
    "1994 ; harbeck et al 2001 ) , although a mild radial gradient was reported for carina ( koch et al .",
    "all these results demonstrate that even small dwarf galaxies , often described as simple systems , contain such complex structures inside .",
    "hence , it is important to explore the whole galaxy from this perspective . a combination of good image quality , depth , and a wide field of view is required for such purposes .",
    "one of the best facilities for conducting such observations is suprime - cam on the 8.2-m subaru telescope .",
    "we therefore carried out a wide - field imaging survey for the local group dwarf spheroidal galaxy leo  ii .",

    "the stellar content of leo  ii was studied extensively by mighell & rich ( 1996 ) using wfpc2 on hst .",

    "they also noted that leo  ii started forming stars about 14@xmath91 gyr ago and formed most of its stellar population during the succeeding 7@xmath91 gyr , with a typical star having formed about 9@xmath91 gyr ago . a more recent study ( koch et al .",
    "2007 ) showed that the mean metallicity of leo  ii is -1.74 based on the measurement of the calcium triplet for 52 red giants .",
    "these investigators also estimated individual ages , and derived a wide age range ( 2 - 15 gyr , the same spread as found by bosler et al .",
    "2004 ) and an essentially flat age - metallicity relation . dolphin ( 2002 ) reanalyzed the hst data and derived the star - formation history of leo  ii .",
    "he claimed that the mean metallicity ( @xmath8}=-1.13 $ ] ) is higher than the estimates of mighell & rich ( 1996 ) and bosler et al .",

    "( 2005 ; fig.2 ) , and according to their identification , most of the brighter blue hb stars are variable stars cataloged by siegel & majewski ( 2000 ) .",
    "we examined the spatial distribution of these stars and found no particular maldistribution ( concentrated or uniform distribution ) .",
    "we note that the contamination from galactic stars is not severe compared to other milky way satellite galaxies ( e.g. , sextans , draco , and ursa minor ; see harbeck et al .",

    "the stars that deviate less than @xmath90.075 mag ( corresponding to 2.3@xmath44 ) in @xmath45 color from the mean rgb sequence are classified as rgb stars .",

    "we set the faint limit of the rgb at @xmath46 to avoid contamination from foreground stars and unresolved background galaxies , as well as to be free from the completeness correction .",
    "the rgb stars were subdivided into bright and faint rgb stars at the hb level ( @xmath47 , mighell & rich 1996 ) .",
    "we compared the mean rgb sequence with those of galactic globular clusters m  15 , ngc  6397 , m  2 , and ngc  1851 taken from da costa & armandroff ( 1990 ) in fig .",

    "the mean rgb sequence of leo  ii lies in between ngc  6397 and m  2 , suggesting that the mean metallicity of leo  ii would be between -1.91 and -1.58 if an old stellar population as galactic globular clusters is assumed .",
    "this value is consistent with those derived spectroscopically by bosler et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and koch et al .",

    "a likely cause of this could be the difference in the size of the survey field and will be discussed further in sect .",

    "we counted the number of stars in each stellar component ( i.e. , bright and faint rgb , blue and red hb ) in an annular area of @xmath48 and divided this by the area of the annulus to derive the number density .",
    "the characteristic radius @xmath49 for an annulus is defined as , @xmath50 in fig .",
    "[ fig : radprof ] the radial profiles for each stellar component are plotted as a function of the characteristic radius .",

    "[ tab : radprof ] .",
    "we fitted the radial profile for each stellar component with the king profile and listed the best - fit parameters in tab .",
    "[ tab : king ] .",
    "the core and tidal radii calculated for all rgb stars are 2.76 arcmin and 8.63 arcmin , respectively , and are consistent with those derived by irwin & hatzidimitriou ( 1995 ) .",
    "bright rgb stars are slightly more concentrated than faint rgb stars in terms of the core radius .",
    "this is also confirmed by a cumulative number fraction plot shown in the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : radprof ] .",
    "we calculated the ks probabilities that two different stellar components had the same spatial distribution .",
    "the probabilities are less than 1% except for the pair of bright rgb and red hb stars ( 76.3% ) .",
    "the king profile fitting for bright rgb stars is achieved for @xmath51 arcmin , as suggested by the best - fit tidal radius of 9.22 arcmin , and the number density of bright rgb stars shows the shallower slope for @xmath52 arcmin and a probable drop at @xmath53 arcmin .",
    "a similar trend is also seen for faint rgb stars , and the change in the slope occurs at @xmath54 arcmin ( c.f . , the best - fit tidal radius of 8.51 arcmin ) , although the number density may reach the field level at @xmath55 arcmin .",
    "the field contamination is estimated in the following way .",
    "ratnatunga & bahcall ( 1985 ) calculated the number of field stars with different colors toward the direction of leo  ii .",
    "the number of field stars with @xmath56 and @xmath57 is estimated to be 0.14 arcmin@xmath58 based on their table .",
    "considering that the color of @xmath59 corresponds to a k0v star and hence , @xmath60 , and that most field stars are redder than @xmath61 , we expect 0.14 arcmin@xmath58 field stars in the color range of @xmath62 .",
    "we therefore estimated that 0.0165 arcmin@xmath58 field stars are in our bright rgb selection criteria ( @xmath57 and @xmath63 ) .",
    "we also estimated the number of field stars using the sdss dr5 archive data ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "the bright rgb selection criteria were determined on the basis of the ( g , i ) color - magnitude diagram of leo  ii and the number of stars within the criteria in the nearby field of leo  ii ( 1 degree from leo  ii ) was determined .",
    "the estimated field contamination is 0.0226 arcmin@xmath58 , which is consistent with that determined above .",
    "we therefore conclude that the number of field contaminations for the bright rgb stars is @xmath64 arcmin@xmath58 and that stars located at @xmath53 arcmin are likely to be dominated by the field population . adopting this field contamination number , we suggest that the shallower slope of the radial profile found for @xmath65 arcmin is real . the field contamination for faint rgb stars",
    "is expected to be smaller than @xmath64 arcmin@xmath58 because of the smaller magnitude coverage of the selection criteria , but contamination from background compact galaxies that are misclassified as stars may occur .",
    "the sdss data are too shallow to be used for estimating the field contamination . if stars found for @xmath53 arcmin consist of such a mixture of field contamination and the background compact galaxies as implied from the analysis for the bright rgb stars , the shallower slope found for @xmath66 arcmin is also suggested to be real .",
    "to further investigate the details of the extra - tidal structure , we made a smoothed surface brightness map for the entire survey field as follows .",
    "stars regarded as rgb or hb stars were listed and gaussians of 1 arcmin kernel multiplied by the luminosity of each star was placed at the position of each star .",
    "they were then coadded to obtain a smoothed surface brightness map .",
    "this operation makes hidden faint structures clearer .",
    "[ fig : densmap ] is the resuling smoothed surface brightness map .",
    "the isosurface - brightness contour of the bright part of the galaxy is almost circular , but it becomes more complicated at a lower surface brightness . the most remarkable feature of fig .  [ fig : densmap ] is the diffuse knotty structure prominent in the eastern part of the galaxy ( @xmath67 = -11 , @xmath68 1 ) . the knot is more than five times more luminous than the position located at the same distance from the center at the opposite side of the galaxy , although the mean surface brightness is quite faint ( @xmath5 31 mag / arcsec@xmath58 ) .",
    "the knot contains four bright rgb stars in @xmath69 arcmin@xmath2 area and the expected field contamination number is 0.4 , indicating that the knot is 99.92% significant above the field population on the basis of poisson statistics .",
    "the extent of this knot is about 4 arcmin ( 270 pc in physical size ) with a width of 2.5 arcmin ( 170 pc ) , and it is small compared to the main body of leo  ii .",
    "the magnitude of this knot was estimated to be @xmath70 by summing up luminosities of 15 stars found in the knot region that are brighter than @xmath46 .",
    "the value is close to the magnitude of the least luminous globular cluster .",
    "the knot must be more luminous because we neglected a contribution from underlying faint stars , and could be more luminous if it is indeed extended farther to the east ( out of our survey field ) , or if the main part of it is already merged with the main body of leo  ii .",
    "it is possible that the substructure is a small globular cluster that is being disrupted and merging into the main body of leo  ii .",
    "the other possibility is that the knot is composed of stars stripped from the main body of leo  ii .",

    "in brief , the hb morphology indicates a distribution in the color of hb stars .",
    "it is often parameterized as @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the numbers of blue and red hb stars , respectively , and @xmath17 is the number of stars lying on the rr lyr instability strip .",
    "intensive investigation on the hb morphology of globular clusters has shown that it depends primarily on metallicity in that less metal - rich systems show a bluer hb morphology , but it is also influenced by the _",

    "the hb morphology is thus a key measure in studying the properties of stellar populations and the variation in the hb morphology within a galaxy is often investigated ( e.g. , harbeck et al .",

    "they showed that the hb morphology index is approximately constant out to @xmath77 arcmin but the fraction of blue hb stars increases beyond @xmath77 arcmin .",

    "koch et al . ( 2007 ) support this suggestion although they did not detect any considerable metallicity or age gradient in leo ii .",
    "the trend of a centrally - concentrated red hb distribution is also observed in many dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the local group ( majewski et al .",
    "1999 ; harbeck et al . 2001",

    "our results support the idea that the radial gradient of the hb morphology is common to dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "for the outer part of the galaxy ( @xmath79 arcmin ) , the hb morphology index looks almost constant at @xmath80 , and the value is larger than that at the inner part ( @xmath81 arcmin ) .",
    "this means that blue hb stars are more numerous , implying that the stellar population in the outer region is less metal - rich and/or older than those in the inner part .",
    "we investigated the color distribution of the rgb stars . in an analogy to the hb morphology index , we used the rgb color index for the analysis , defined as @xmath82 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the numbers of stars that deviate less than 0.075 mag bluer and redder from the mean rgb sequence , respectively ( see also fig .",

    "the color index is distributed around zero at any radius except for the center where red rgb stars seem to be numerous .",
    "this fact gives a reasonable explanation for the color difference of the mean rgb sequence between this study and the redder mean rgb color of mighell & rich ( 1996 ) .",
    "since their survey was limited to a small area ( 4.44 arcmin@xmath2 ) at the galaxy center , they inevitably sampled red rgb stars , which are numerous at the center , and hence obtained a redder mean rgb color .",

    "this is consistent with the results of mighell & rich ( 1996 ) , who noted the wide age spread ( @xmath90gyr ) for the stellar population at the center .",
    "the color distribution becomes more concentrated to @xmath91 for @xmath92 arcmin .",
    "this would imply that the stellar population for @xmath92 arcmin is more homogeneous compared to that for @xmath93 arcmin ..",
    "mighell & rich ( 1996 ) derived the age distribution of the stellar population in the center of the galaxy on the basis of the magnitude distribution of subgiant branch ( sgb ) stars .",
    "[ fig : cmfea ]  ( c ) focuses on the color - magnitude diagram around the bottom of the rgb and the turn - off point .",
    "the green lines represent padova isochrones for ages 5 , 10 , and 15 gyr and metallicity z=0.0004 ( girardi et al .",
    "as shown in the figure , the isochrones are almost parallel to the @xmath45 axis ( i.e. , constant @xmath17 magnitude ) at the sgb ( @xmath94 ) , indicating that the magnitude at a fixed @xmath45 color can be translated to age .",
    "the difference in metallicity also affects the shape of the isochrone , but small differences in metallicity ( e.g. z=0.001 , shown as magenta lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmfea ]  ( c ) ) do not change the shape significantly .",
    "since it is unlikely that metal rich population ( @xmath95 ) dominates the stellar population in leo  ii as suggested by the shape of mean rgb sequence , we can estimate the age distribution using the magnitude distribution of sgb stars .",
    "we examined the magnitude distribution of stars with @xmath96 and @xmath97 , which we call sgb .",
    "the region in the color - magnitude diagram is shown as a cyan box in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmfea ] ( a ) and ( c ) .",
    "a difficulty , however , occurs in applying this method to our data ; the error in color becomes larger than the width of the selection criteria , @xmath97 , for @xmath98 .",
    "this increases the uncertainty in the number estimation of sgb stars fainter than @xmath99 .",
    "nevertheless , we were able to obtain a clue as to the age distribution in the following way .",
    "the key lies in the brighter sgb stars ( @xmath25 ) , which indicate the presence of a younger stellar population .",
    "we can estimate what fraction of the total stellar population the young population accounts for by comparing the number ratio of bright sgb stars to faint rgb stars with a theoretical calculation .",
    "we therefore investigated the number ratio of sgb stars to faint rgb stars as a function of the radius .    to derive the number of sgb stars",
    ", the incompleteness of the detection and contaminations from unresolved background galaxies and the foreground stars must be properly corrected .",
    "we estimated the incompleteness for every 0.5 mag grid in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 bands and for 1 arcmin in radius using real images as explained in sect .",
    "[ sec : obs ] .",
    "[ fig : comp_mag ] shows the completeness as a function of magnitude in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 bands at different radii ( @xmath100 = 0 , 2.5 , 5.0 , 10.0 arcmin ) . with this incompleteness table in hand ,",
    "the incompleteness at a given @xmath17 magnitude , color ( i.e. , @xmath18 magnitude , once @xmath17 magnitude is given ) , and radius is estimated by a linear interpolation .",
    "the numbers of sgb stars are corrected for incompleteness calculated above . to estimate the number of contaminations , we regarded stars found at @xmath101 as contaminations , and the magnitude distribution of ( incompleteness - corrected ) contaminations with @xmath97 were fitted to the 4th order polynomials as , @xmath102 . to derive the number of sgb stars in a given annulus ,",
    "the contamination number function @xmath103 multiplied by the area of the annulus wa subtracted from the incompleteness - corrected number .",
    "the number ratios of sgb stars to faint rgb stars are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sgfrgbratio ] as a function of the radius . in the figure ,",
    "the number ratios are plotted separately for bright sgb stars ( @xmath104 , filled squares ) and intermediate sgb stars ( @xmath105 , open triangles ) .",
    "note that @xmath104 and @xmath105 populations roughly correspond to @xmath106 gyr and @xmath107 gyr populations , respectively .",
    "we noted that the number ratios for both bright and intermediate sgb stars increase toward the center of the galaxy .",
    "the slope is steeper for intermediate sgb stars .",
    "the number ratio can be calculated theoretically for a stellar population of fixed age and metallicity using padova isochrones and the initial mass function .",
    "we adopted salpeter s form for the initial mass function .",
    "the calculation shows that the number ratios for bright sgb stars ( @xmath104 ) range @xmath108 for z=0.0004 population stars .",
    "if a stellar population is dominated by a z=0.0004 population , the number ratio should be close to the value .",
    "the number for a z=0.001 population ranges @xmath109 .",
    "although the calculated values are different according to the adopted metallicity , the number ratios at any radius are well below all the calculated values .",
    "this indicates that a population younger than 4 gyr is not a dominant population , although it certainly resides in the galaxy center .",
    "the existence of a stellar population as young as 2 gyr reported by bosler et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and koch et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also supports our finding .",
    "the increase in the number ratio at the galaxy center suggests that ( 1 ) the fraction of the young population is higher at the center than at the periphery , ( 2 ) the metallicity of the young population is higher at the center than at the periphery , or ( 3 ) a combination of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .    for intermediate sgb stars ( @xmath105 ) ,",
    "the calculated number ratios range @xmath110 and @xmath111 for z=0.0004 and z=0.001 populations , respectively .",
    "the number ratio is @xmath112 at the center and @xmath113 within 3 arcmin from the center , indicating that an intermediate age population ( @xmath114 gyr ) is dominant at the galaxy center .",
    "this is consistent with the finding by mighell & rich ( 1996 ) and dolphin ( 2002 ) that a considerable stellar population younger than 8 gyr occurs at the center of leo  ii .",
    "however , the number ratios of both bright and intermediate sgb stars become small as the radius increases , indicating that the stellar population at the outskirts of the galaxy is deficient in young population , i.e. , most of the stars are older than 8 gyr .",
    "the stellar population in the outskirts of the galaxy ( @xmath115 ) was shown to consist of mostly older stars ( @xmath6 8 gyr ) .",
    "if metal abundance is nearly homogeneous , such an old population must form a narrow color distribution at the rgb , which is confirmed by a concentrated distribution in @xmath45 color of faint rgb stars as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : frgbchist ] .",
    "a comparison of padova isochrones with the color distribution of rgb stars in the outskirts suggests low - metal - abundance populations ( between z=0.0004 and z=0.001 ) in the outskirts if ages of @xmath116 gyr are assumed . the larger hb morphology index ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hbmorph ] ) also supports an old population with low metal abundance .",
    "we conclude that the dominant population in the outskirts of the galaxy is an old population with low metal abundance .",
    "the stellar population at the center of the galaxy , however , shows a variety of age .",
    "it is necessary to include stars younger than 10 gyr , but a young population with low metal abundance , for example , @xmath117 10 gyr and z=0.0004 population , is excluded since the isochrone would not trace the rgb distribution .",
    "therefore , a higher metal abundance ( z @xmath12 0.001 , possibly z @xmath12 0.004 for very young population ) is suggested .    from the foregoing results ,",
    "leo  ii is suggested to have evolved as follows .",
    "leo  ii first started to form stars over the whole galaxy about 15 gyr ago with a modest ( probably low ) star - formation rate .",
    "star formation lasted for some time and the interstellar gas gained metals .",
    "then about 8 gyr ago , star formation began to cease from the outskirts and the star - forming region gradually became more concentrated to the center .",
    "the star - forming activity had dropped to @xmath5 0 by @xmath5 4 gyr ago , except for the center where a small population younger than 4 gyr occurs .",
    "hensler et al .",
    "( 2004 ) demonstrated the one - dimensional chemodynamical evolution of dwarf elliptical galaxies , and showed the interesting feature that the star - forming region shrinks as a galaxy evolves because of gas exhaustion in the galaxy .",
    "their simulation seems to outline the evolution of leo  ii fairly well , although it requires a refinement to fully explain our results . since a population gradient within a galaxy",
    "is also observed for several local group dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( e.g. , harbeck et al .",
    "2001 ) , a more refined chemodynamical model will be necessary to explain the population gradient in the future to clarify the evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "the origin of the knotty substructure found at the extended halo of leo  ii could be ( 1 ) a small globular cluster , which is disrupted and merged with the main body of leo  ii , ( 2 ) stars stripped from the main body of leo  ii , or ( 3 ) a foreground artifact .",
    "the properties of stellar populations such as hb morphology are almost the same between outside the tidal radius and at the outskirts of the main body , indicating that the knot would be dominated by old stars with low metal abundance .",
    "to further investigate the stellar population of the knot , we made a hess diagram from which field contaminations were statistically subtracted . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hess ] , although the field subtraction is not perfect , two significant concentrations of stars are observed around the red clump ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 ) and the turn - off point ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 ) like that seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : cmd ] .",
    "this suggests that the knot is likely to consist of a similar stellar population as that residing in the outskirts of leo  ii and the probability of ( 3 ) is low .",
    "however , based on this figure , it is still difficult to determine whether possibility ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) is more likely .",
    "if the second scenario is true , the tidal influence of the galaxy would be the most efficient mechanism to strip stars from the main body of leo  ii .",
    "indeed , many dwarf spheroidal galaxies such as draco and ursa minor are now known to host extra - tidal halo structures although they are closer to the galaxy and hence more influenced by the galactic tidal force .",
    "however , the present - day remote location of leo  ii from the galaxy raises the question of whether the tidal force of the galaxy is enough to strip stars from the main body of leo  ii .",
    "in addition , the fact that we do not detect any obvious extra - tidal structure at the opposite side of leo  ii is unfavorable for this scenario .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that tidally stripped stars are the origin of the knotty substructure . if the knot is indeed a result of the tidal stripping , it should be aligned to the direction parallel to the motion of leo  ii .",
    "therefore , measuring the proper motion of leo  ii would provide a clue to answering this problem , although it would still be quite challenging .",
    "the fact that no globular clusters are found to associate with less luminous dwarf spheroidals such as leo  ii does not support the first scenario for the origin of the knot .",
    "but it is possible that leo  ii formed together with a small number of globular clusters and we may be watching the disruption process of the last one that happened to survive until the recent past .",
    "it is interesting that kleyna et al .",
    "( 2003 ) demonstrated the survival of a substructure for a hubble time in a cored dark - matter halo .",
    "they suggested that the substructures found in ursa minor are the remnants of a disrupted stellar cluster and that ursa minor possesses a cored dark - matter halo .",
    "following their idea , we suggest that leo  ii may be another example of a galaxy with a cored dark - matter halo .",
    "recent numerical simulations suggest that dark halos of dwarf spheroidals are larger than previously thought , and hence , extra - tidal stars are gravitationally bound to the galaxies and are a part of the extended stellar halos ( hayashi et al .",
    "2003 ; mashchenko et al .",
    "the extended halo structure found in this study might be a structure bound to leo  ii according to the predictions of the simulations .",
    "we carried out a wide - field imaging survey of the local group dwarf spheroidal galaxy leo  ii in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 bands using suprime - cam on the 8.2-m subaru telescope .",
    "the survey covered an area of @xmath1 arcmin@xmath2 , far beyond the tidal radius of the leo  ii ( 8.63 arcmin ) .",
    "a total of 82252 stars was detected down to the limiting magnitude of @xmath3 , which is roughly 1 mag deeper than the turn - off point of the main sequence stars of leo  ii .",
    "our main conclusions are summarized below .    *",
    "the radial number density profile of bright rgb stars is shown to continue beyond the tidal radius ( @xmath122 arcmin ) .",
    "a change in the slope occurs near the tidal radius and the slope becomes shallower for @xmath52 arcmin .",
    "a hint of a drop is seen in number density at @xmath53 arcmin .",
    "a similar two - component profile is also observed for faint rgb stars . *",
    "a smoothed surface brightness map of leo  ii suggests the existence of a small substructure beyond the tidal radius , which is as large as globular clusters in luminosity ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "it could possibly be a disrupted globular cluster of leo  ii that had survived until the recent past .",
    "another possibility is that it is composed of stars stripped from the main body of leo  ii , although this is unlikely . *",
    "the hb morphology index shows a radial gradient in the sense that red hb stars are more concentrated than blue hb stars . such a trend",
    "is also observed in several local group dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "the hb morphology index implies that the stellar population in the outer part ( @xmath79 arcmin ) is more metal - poor and/or older than that in the inner part . *",
    "the rgb color index is almost constant at any radius except for the center , where a redder mean rgb sequence than ours was observed by mighell & rich ( 1996 ) .",
    "the color distribution of rgb stars around the mean rgb sequence shows a broader distribution at the center ( @xmath124 arcmin ) than the outskirts .",
