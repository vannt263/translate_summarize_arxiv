    "cataclysmic variables consist of a white dwarf primary and a late - type main - sequence companion star which is mass - losing by the roche - lobe overflow .",
    "the white dwarf accretes the mass from the secondary through an accretion disk in non - magnetic systems . in magnetic systems , however , either the formation of the disk is fully prevented , or the inner disk is truncated , depending on the magnetic fields of the white dwarf and the binary parameters . within the magnetosphere radius the mass falls along the magnetic field toward poles of the white dwarf , where radiations from x - ray to optical emission is originated .",
    "magnetic systems are divided into two classes of polars and intermediate polars ( ips ) .",
    "the polars are the systems with strong fields and a synchronously rotating white dwarf , and are soft x - ray sources .",
    "ips are ones with weaker fields and an asynchronously rotating white dwarf , and are hard x - ray sources .",
    "reviews for the magnetic systems are given by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",

    "gk per shows long outbursts that last for 2  months @xcite .",
    "remaining 5 ips show rather short outbursts .",
    "outbursts of xy ari @xcite and do dra @xcite are with amplitudes of @xmath2  mag and durations of @xmath3  d. tv col @xcite and v1223 sgr @xcite show very short low - amplitude outbursts that last only @xmath4  d. outbursts of ex hya have intermediate characteristics between the previous two types , that is , with amplitudes of @xmath5  mag and durations of @xmath6  d @xcite .",
    "outbursts of gk per are explained as inside - out outbursts by thermal instability in the disk , though the atypically large inner radius and mass transfer rate are required to fit the observed recurrence time and duration of outbursts @xcite .",
    "outbursts of xy ari and do dra rather resemble outbursts of dwarf novae and also explained as inside - out outbursts by disk instability @xcite .",
    "the recurrence time one order longer than the typical value is thought to be due to inner truncation of the disk @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the short - lived and low - amplitude outbursts of tv col and v1223 sgr are thought to be mass transfer outbursts @xcite .",

    "however , the existence of dwarf nova - like outbursts and the short orbital period allowed an alternative interpretation that it may be an su uma - type dwarf nova or wz sge - type stars @xcite . after the discovery , five outbursts were recorded ( vsnet - alert 1379 ,",

    "the pulse amplitude in flux scale continuously reduced as the system declined , but in magnitude scale it decreased once and increased again during the rapidly declining phase ( figure [ fig : spin_profile ] ) , that is , the declining rate of the pulse flux was slower than that of the total flux of the system . the pulse flux and the total flux roughly correspond to the accretion rate onto the white dwarf and the accretion rate through the outer region .",
    "the discrepancy of declining speeds of two accretion rates suggests the existence of a disk , rather than via ballistic accretion .",
    "@xcite suggested 81  min as the orbital period of ht cam from the radial velocity curves , but they could not reject 76  min and 86  min .",
    "their quiescent photometry showed no modulations with the period of @xmath2881  min .",
    "this indicates the low inclination of ht cam . in our observations , after the declining to quiescence , no modulations with the orbital period were observed , however , large - amplitude quasi - periodic modulations with the period of 86  min were observed during the declining phase of the outburst .",
    "these modulations are likely related to the orbital period .",
    "if the orbital period of ht cam is 81  min , our period is longer than it . during superoutbursts in su uma - type dwarf novae , modulations with a period a few percent longer than its orbital period ,",
    "called superhumps are observed @xcite .",
    "it is known that superhumps are detected regardless of the inclination of the system . however , in conjunction with the short duration of the outburst , we consider the 86-min unlikely represents the superhump period .",
    "this period more likely reflects the true orbital period among the aliases listed in @xcite .    in wz sge stars , a small sub - group of su uma - type dwarf novae with very short orbital periods of around 8090  min , modulations with orbital periods , called early superhumps , appear in the early stage of superoutbursts @xcite .",
    "early superhumps have double - humped plofile regardless of the inclination of the system . however , the averaged profile shown in figure [ fig:1st_night ] is not double - humped .",
    "thus the possibility that the modulations were early superhumps is excluded .",
    "the existence of the orbital modulations only during the outburst may be due to the changing aspect of a irradiated surface of the secondary star , an enhanced hot spot moving into and out of our line of sight , partial eclipse of the thickend and brightened disk , or a combination of them .",
    "the visual observations covering four years with fairly good density have detected 6 rather regular outbursts with an amplitude of @xmath29  mag and a duration of @xmath30  d. our observations on the 6th outburst of ht cam confirmed the short duration and rapid fading , perhaps slightly slower than rising .",
    "the outburst amplitude was @xmath31  mag , though its duration was very short .",
    "ex hya shows outbursts with a similar short duration of @xmath32  d and the amplitude of @xmath32  mag . @xcite",
    "mentioned that the outbursts of ex hya are mass transfer events rather than disk instabilities , due to the rarity and irregularity of the outbursts ( e.g. no outburst was observed in a period of more than 10 yr , however , in another period , two outbursts occurred with an interval of only 8  d ) , the declining rate , the increased equivalent widths of emission lines and the enhanced mass - transfer stream during the outbursts .",
    "however , the outburst profile , which shows rather slower declining at first and then very fast declining later , and the regularity of the outburst recurrence time of ht cam are similar to those of do dra . do dra shows outbursts with a duration of @xmath3  days and a recurrence time of 868  d @xcite .",
    "they are explained by disk instability as dwarf novae @xcite .",
    "the differences of ht cam from do dra are the shorter outburst duration within @xmath33  d , and the shorter cycle length of @xmath12  d. the recurrence time of ht cam is quite typical value among the dwarf novae , compared with those of two intermediate polars whose outbursts are likely explained by disk instabilities ( @xmath34  d of do dra as written above , and @xmath35  d or more of gk per ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are several dwarf novae that have recurrence times about or longer than @xmath12  d and show short outbursts about 35  d ( e.g. ht cas , ek tra , ir com ) .    @xcite calculated the effects of the inner disk truncation on the outbursts in the intermediate polars : the duration becomes shorter in both cases of mass transfer instability and disk instabilities , and for the outbursts by disk instabilities , the interval becomes longer if the outburst starts at the inside , however does not change if the outburst starts at the outer disk edge .    using this result",
    ", we can explain the outburst behavior of ht cam as follows .",
    "the outbursts are caused by disk instabilities starting at the outside , thus the recurrence time is comparable to those of dwarf novae , @xmath12  d. the short duration and the rapid decline of the outburst are due to the inner truncation of the disk .",
    "this is consistent with the rather short spin period indicating intermediate magnetic fields @xcite , and the discrepancy between the declining rates of pulse flux and total flux strongly suggesting the existence of the disk .",
    "we observed the cataclysmic variable ht cam in outburst which occurred on 2001 december 29 .",
    "we detected quasi - periodic oscillations in the light curve of the declining phase of the outburst whose center periods are calculated to be 8.56  min and 86.5  min .",
    "strong 8.56  min oscillations during the outburst are white dwarf spin pulses and the ip classification was confirmed .",
    "we identified the 86.5  min period as the orbital period of ht cam , which was determined as @xmath36  min by tovmassian et al .",
    "the rather short spin period indicates the magnetic field of ht cam is not so strong , and the discrepancy between the declining rates of pulse flux and total flux suggests the existence of the disk .",
    "additionally , we found that the intervals of the past six outbursts are the multiples of 150  d. the regularity of outbursts suggests that the outbursts on ht cam is caused by disk instabilities starting at the outer disk edge .",
