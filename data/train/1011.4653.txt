    "higher reidemeister torsion invariants are cohomology classes in the base of certain smooth manifold bundles which can sometimes be used to distinguish between different smooth structures on the same topological manifold bundle .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to determine which cohomology classes occur as higher reidemeister torsion invariants of exotic smooth structures on the same topological manifold bundle .",
    "we also determine to what extent the higher torsion distinguishes between different smooth structures on the same bundle .",
    "since the higher torsion is a sequence of real cohomology classes which are `` stable '' , it can only detect the torsion - free part of the group of stable smooth structures on topological bundles .",

    "therefore , these two invariants agree on the arc de triomphe construction and we only need to show that there are enough of these examples to generate a subgroup of the domain of finite index .    to prove this last statement we use theorem [ main result of giw ] above which is derived from the -version of smoothing theory and proved in @xcite .",
    "the latter result says that the group of isomorphism classes of stable exotic smooth structures on @xmath8 , when tensored with @xmath27 , is isomorphic to the direct sum of the real homology groups of the total space in degrees @xmath52 .",

    "the adt construction and the immersed hatcher handle construction ( section 2 ) are generalizations of a classical construction of hatcher ( reviewed in section 1 ) which produces exotic smooth structures on linear disk bundles .    just as",

    "we call this the _ immersed hatcher construction_. the reason that @xmath58 needs to be an immersion is because , following the proofs of lemmas [ first version of adt lemma ] and [ stratified deformation lemma ] , we see that @xmath56 is constructed from a fiberwise generalized morse function on @xmath8 and each morse critical point of @xmath75 of even index gives an element of @xmath56 mapping to @xmath76 .",
    "thus , we can not expect @xmath58 to be an embedding .    for fixed @xmath69 and @xmath77",
    "there are two kinds of hatcher handles which we call `` negative '' and `` positive '' hatcher handles . the attaching map for the negative hatcher handle @xmath78 can be deformed to be on top of the positive hatcher handle @xmath79 in such a way that they cancel as shown in figure [ adt figure ] .",

    "we denote by @xmath87 the group of deformation classes of stratified subsets @xmath80 of @xmath8 .",
    "the arc de triomphe construction thus gives a map @xmath88 which we show to be additive in proposition [ sd is a group ] .",
    "one of the key results ( lemma [ first version of adt lemma ] ) is that this map is rationally surjective , i.e. , its cokernel is finite . to prove this we use the computation of the homotopy type of the space of generalized morse functions @xcite which implies that there is a fiberwise generalized morse function @xmath89 whose singular set @xmath90 together with a suitable multiple @xmath91 its vector bundle data @xmath92 given by the second derivative of @xmath15 gives an element of @xmath87 which maps onto a spanning subset of the real homology group @xmath93 in the following diagram , this is expressed by saying that the curved mapping @xmath94 from @xmath95 to @xmath96 maps onto a spanning subset where @xmath97 is the map ( subsection [ ss312 ] ) which sends @xmath98 to the image in @xmath40 of the poincar dual of the normalized chern character ( def .",

    "so , it suffices to show that @xmath103 , i.e. , that this diagram commutes .",
    "this is the statement of lemma [ th adt=2ch ] .    finally , we come to the stratified deformation lemma [ stratified deformation lemma ] which is used to prove that every adt construction can be deformed into an immersed hatcher construction .",
    "this crucial lemma allows us to compute the higher -torsion invariant and show that they agree with the other invariant @xmath104 on the same collection of exotic smooth structures as those given by the adt construction .",
    "the main theorems then follow as we have outlined above .",
    "the arc de triomphe construction uses `` stratified subsets '' of the bundle @xmath8 with coefficients in @xmath47 . in the case",
    "when @xmath8 is a closed manifold , these are defined to be closed oriented @xmath28-submanifolds @xmath105 , where @xmath45 , so that the restriction of the projection map @xmath0 to @xmath81 has only _",
    "fold singularities_. these are points at which @xmath12 is given , in local coordinates , by @xmath106 then @xmath81 becomes the union of two submanifolds @xmath107 and @xmath108 where @xmath107 , resp .",
    "@xmath108 , is the closure of the set of all points at which @xmath109 is nonsingular and orientation preserving , resp .",

    "( gmf ) on @xmath8 is a smooth map @xmath112 with the property that @xmath15 has only morse and birth - death singularities on the fibers .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the vertical derivative of @xmath15 , as a section of @xmath10 , is transverse to the zero section and that the singular set is a stratified subset of @xmath8 .",
    "then @xmath107 , resp .",
    "@xmath108 , is the closure of the union of all morse critical points of @xmath15 of even , resp .",
    "odd , index and @xmath113 is the set of degenerate critical points of @xmath15 .",
    "the coefficient map @xmath114 is given by the hessian of @xmath15 at each critical point .",
    "( see @xcite . )",
    "using the fact that @xmath47 is rationally equivalent to @xmath46 , we can lift a nonzero multiple of the coefficient map to @xmath47 .",
    "( take the direct sum of the corresponding vector bundle over @xmath81 with itself several times . )",
    "the main theorem of @xcite is that the space of gmfs on a single manifold @xmath1 has the @xmath33 homotopy type of @xmath115 .",
    "thus a fiberwise gmf is equivalent to a section of a bundle with that fiber and a standard homotopy theoretic argument proved in corollary 2.2.2 of @xcite implies that the corresponding stratified sets with coefficients lifted to @xmath47 will represent ( a multiple of ) any element of @xmath116 .",
    "the adt construction produces the exotic smooth structure corresponding to this homology class using this stratified set .",
    "our key result ( theorem [ intro : key result ] above ) can be interpreted as saying that the relative higher -torsion is equal to the relative higher -torsion if we define the latter to be the poincar dual of the image of the relative smooth structure class in the homology of the base .",
    "this proposed definition agrees with the following recent theorem of badzioch , dorabiala , klein and williams @xcite but the two results do not imply each other , even if the definitions were known to agree , since the absolute higher torsion (  or ) is not always defined .",
    "[ thm of bdkw ] suppose that @xmath41 is a smooth unipotent bundle ( definition [ defn : unipotent ] ) .",
    "then , for all @xmath26 , the degree @xmath117 smooth -torsion invariant of @xmath8 is proportional to the -torsion : @xmath118 for some nonzero real number @xmath119 depending only on @xmath120 .",
    "dwyer , weiss and williams originally defined their higher smooth torsion in the case where the action of @xmath121 on the homology of the fiber @xmath1 is trivial .",
    "this definition was later extended by badzioch , dorabiala and williams @xcite to the unipotent case where @xmath122 has a filtration by @xmath123-submodules so that the associated graded module has a trivial action of @xmath123 . in @xcite badzioch ,",
    "dorabiala , klein and williams show that this extended theory satisfies the axioms for higher torsion given in @xcite .",
    "since these axioms characterize exotic higher torsion invariants up to a scalar multiple , the formula @xmath124 above holds for all smooth unipotent bundles .",
    "the relation between theorem [ thm of bdkw ] and our second main theorem [ intro : key result ] is very roughly as follows . given two smooth structures @xmath125 on the same unipotent bundle @xmath41 , the two difference torsion invariants are defined and equal to the difference between the absolute torsions of @xmath125 : @xmath126 @xmath127 this is proved in @xcite for the case of @xmath128 and should be fairly straightforward to prove in the case of @xmath129 if the relative -torsion is defined correctly .",
    "therefore , theorem [ thm of bdkw ] implies that these difference torsions are proportional in the case when the bundles are unipotent .",
    "our theorem [ intro : key result ] could be interpreted as giving a conceptual definition of the higher -difference torsion in terms of -smoothing theory , showing that it is equal to the higher -difference torsion defined using morse theory .",
    "we believe that our version of -difference torsion ( defined as the poincar dual of the image of @xmath130 in @xmath131 ) is equal to @xmath132 . by our theorem [ second main theorem ] , this would be equivalent to showing that the proportionality constant in the theorem of badzioch , dorabiala , klein and williams is equal to 1 : @xmath133 so that @xmath134 ! however , we do not attempt to prove this here .",
    "when the fibers are closed even dimensional manifolds , the theorem above still holds by corollary [ second main theorem : even case ] .",
    "however , the relative higher torsion class @xmath37 is equal to zero in that case : @xmath135 since @xmath136 depends only on the vertical tangent bundle of @xmath8 over @xmath3 by @xcite and @xmath17 has the same vertical tangent bundle as @xmath8 by definition of tangential homeomorphism .",
    "this leads to the following conjecture .",
    "the stable smooth structure class vanishes when the fiber is a closed oriented even dimensional manifold : @xmath137 in other words , rationally stably , there are no exotic smooth structures on manifold bundles with closed oriented even dimensional fibers .    theorem",

    ". then we will cut apart the set @xmath108 by deleting a tubular neighborhood of each interior simplex @xmath825 starting with the lowest dimension @xmath826 .",
    "let @xmath827 be a vertex in the interior of @xmath108 .",
    "near @xmath827 we embed the ribbon @xmath828 and we will perform the deformation completely inside of this ribbon .",
    "( @xmath826 ) the desired stratified deformation is given in example [ eg : mushroom ] but with the labels @xmath829 reversed and with @xmath830 . in words",
    ", we create a @xmath28-lens above the point @xmath827 ( above means in the direction of the vector field @xmath657 of remark [ rem : vertical vector field ] ) together with the coefficient map sending the entire @xmath28-lens to @xmath831 .",
    "this is the @xmath738 part of example [ eg : mushroom ] .",
    "then we attach the mushroom and cancel the portion of @xmath108 around @xmath827 as in the @xmath739 picture of the example . remembering that we have reversed @xmath829 we see that the new @xmath108 is the disjoint union of @xmath832 ( the `` top '' of the mushroom ) and the old @xmath108 with a disk shaped hole cut out around @xmath827 .",
    "in other words , we have _ removed _ a neighborhood of @xmath827 from the old @xmath108 .",
    "( @xmath833 ) next , take a 1-simplex in @xmath108 .",
    "since we have attached mushrooms on the two endpoints , the picture of this 1-simplex is as follows .",
    "since @xmath81 is @xmath28-dimensional , we have the product with @xmath834 in a small neighborhood of the 1-simplex where the endpoints stay inside the stems of the mushrooms planted on the endpoints .",
    "we focus attention to a small neighborhood of the 1-simplex in @xmath108 ( ignoring the @xmath108 tops of the old mushrooms ) .",
    "then , on the two @xmath107 segments ( @xmath835 ) we plant two new mushrooms ( with @xmath836 tops ) and perform the deformation in figure [ fig : deleting an edge ] .",
    "when one of the endpoints of the 1-simplex lies on the boundary of the original set @xmath108 , we will not have a mushroom and the figure above is not quite accurate in that case .",
    "however , we will still have a @xmath107 segment which meets the boundary of @xmath108 along @xmath113 and we can still perform this deformation ( plant two mushrooms ) and figure [ fig : deleting an edge ] will be accurate in this case .",
    "when we plant the two new mushrooms , a new @xmath108 component @xmath663 diffeomorphic to @xmath837 is created .",
    "this is contained in @xmath838 .",
    "when we do the deformation indicated , we attach a solid @xmath28-handle to this to form a contractible subset of the new @xmath81 containing the new component of @xmath108 ( which is now homotopy equivalent to a wedge of two @xmath504 spheres , but with each sphere filled in with a @xmath28-disk @xmath839 ) we also extend the coefficient map by using the values of @xmath99 on the old 1-simplex in @xmath108 at the bottom of the figure .",
    "this old 1-simplex is now at the bottom of a 1-lens and this can be cancelled by the deformation obtained by rotating the lens since the top of lens and the bottom of the lens have matching coefficient maps .",
    "the result is that the set @xmath108 is changed by the deletion of the 1-simplex . in more standard language",
    ", this last step performs surgery on a circle @xmath840 embedded in @xmath81 so that half the circle is in @xmath107 and half is in @xmath108 .",
    "this second half is the 1-simplex which has been `` eliminated . ''",
    "suppose by induction that the @xmath842 skeleton of @xmath108 has been removed where @xmath841 .",
    "let @xmath843 be what remains of one of the original @xmath77-simplices of @xmath108 .",
    "then @xmath843 has boundary @xmath844 .",
    "part of this boundary comes from the original boundary of @xmath108 and the other part comes from the inductive procedure .",
    "there are remnants of mushrooms from previous steps in the construction and we need to avoid them and use only those structures which exist in all parts of the boundary of @xmath845 .",
    "since @xmath81 is @xmath28 dimensional , this disk sits in @xmath846 .",
    "the next step in the deformation is given by planting the product of @xmath847 with a mushroom of dimension @xmath848 .",
    "the picture is the same as figure [ fig : deleting an edge ] .",
    "so , we do not redraw it .",
    "however , we give a new interpretation of the same figure .",
    "take the left hand figure in figure [ fig : deleting an edge ] .",
    "this is a planar figure which is now being spun around the middle vertical axis over all @xmath849 .",
    "the tops of the mushrooms , which are given locally by @xmath739 in example [ eg : mushroom ] , become diffeomorphic to @xmath850 . for all @xmath851 ,",
    "we replace these mushrooms with the @xmath852 picture from example [ eg : mushroom ] and spin around @xmath847 .",
    "this gives a stratified set over @xmath853 which contains a new components @xmath854 diffeomorphic to @xmath855 .",
    "however , with the tops of the mushrooms we get @xmath856 .",
    "the deformation ( passing from left to right ) in figure [ fig : deleting an edge ] is to be carried out only for @xmath857 close to the origin in @xmath858 otherwise the points indicated with spots are not in the picture and , again , we use the value of the coefficient map on the @xmath77-simplex in @xmath108 to extend the value of @xmath99 to the top of the new @xmath77-lens that we have formed .",
    "this deformation performs surgery on a @xmath842 sphere in @xmath81 which lies in @xmath113 on the boundary of @xmath859 .",
    "this changes @xmath859 into a @xmath28-disk .",
    "so , the new component of @xmath108 is contained in a contractible subset of @xmath81 .    on the right hand side of figure",
    "[ fig : deleting an edge ] we have an @xmath77-lens which can be eliminated by example [ eg : k - lens ] since the value of @xmath99 on top and bottom match by construction .",
    "this performs surgery on an @xmath77-sphere in @xmath81 which meets @xmath108 is an @xmath77-disk which is the remains of the @xmath77-simplex which we are trying to eliminate .",
