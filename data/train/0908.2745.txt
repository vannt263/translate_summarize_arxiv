    "in @xcite , rasmussen defined a homomorphism on the smooth concordance group of knots @xmath3    @xmath4    which he showed had the property that    @xmath5    where we write @xmath6 for the smooth @xmath7-ball genus ( or _ slice genus _ ) of @xmath1 .",
    "the starting point for this paper is the following theorem of rasmussen s @xcite :    [ raspos ] for positive knots @xmath1 ( that is , knots which admit a diagram with no negative crossings )    @xmath8    the point being that in the case of positive knots @xmath1 , the computation of @xmath2 is a triviality and agrees with twice the genus of an obvious candidate for a minimal - genus slicing surface ( namely the one obtained by pushing the seifert surface given by seifert s algorithm into the @xmath7-ball ) .",
    "the invariant @xmath2 is equivalent to all the information contained in @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the perturbed version of standard khovanov homology first defined and studied by lee @xcite .",
    "there is a spectral sequence with @xmath11 page being the standard khovanov homology of a knot @xmath1 and @xmath12 page being the bigraded group @xmath13 and many efforts to compute @xmath14 for knots other than for positive knots have made use of the existence of spectral sequences ( for some nice examples see @xcite ) .",
    "however , since it is known that @xmath15 for @xmath16 , to define @xmath2 only requires knowledge of the partial chain complex    @xmath17    where @xmath0 is a diagram of @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , since explicit representatives for a basis of @xmath9 are known at the chain level , one only needs to know the map    @xmath18    for a positive diagram @xmath0 , @xmath19 .",
    "this is what made theorem [ raspos ] a trivial corollary once the properties of @xmath14 were established .    by studying this map",
    "we obtain a diagram - dependent upperbound @xmath20 for @xmath2 .",
    "we also give an error estimate @xmath21 for this upperbound .",
    "the resulting lowerbound @xmath22 for @xmath2 improves upon previously known rudolph - bennequin - type inequalities .",
    "we give a list of particular cases where @xmath23 vanishes and so @xmath20 necessarily agrees with @xmath2 .",
    "the following results are stated for knots , since the rasmussen invariant is most familiar in this setting .",
    "some results however admit a generalization to links ( via the definition of @xmath14 for links as found for example in @xcite ) .",
    "we discuss this in section [ linksection ] .",
    "our results concern an easily - computable number @xmath24 which is defined from an oriented knot diagram @xmath0 . postponing an explicit description of how to compute @xmath20 until definition [ maindefn ] ,",
    "we begin by giving some results .",
    "[ upperbound ] @xmath25    of course , we must remember that @xmath26 depends only on the isotopy class of the knot represented by @xmath0 , whereas the same is not true of @xmath20 . hence in order for the bound of theorem [ upperbound ] to be a good bound , we should expect to be forced to give some restrictions on diagrams @xmath0 :    [ posandneg ] the bound of theorem [ upperbound ] is tight for positive diagrams @xmath0 and for negative diagrams @xmath0 .",

    "then if @xmath29 is any word in the @xmath30 letters    @xmath31    and @xmath32 is a knot diagram which is the closure of the @xmath33-stranded braid represented by @xmath29 , then we have    @xmath34    we note that knots admitting such a braid presentation are known to be fibered @xcite , so in particular not every knot admits such a presentation .    [ alternating ]",
    "let @xmath0 be an alternating diagram of a knot .",
    "then we have    @xmath35    propositions [ posandneg ] , [ braid ] , and [ alternating ] are each consequences of theorem [ trees ] for which we need a few definitions . given a diagram @xmath0 we write @xmath36 for the oriented resolution .",
    "we form a decorated graph @xmath37 , known as the seifert graph of @xmath0 , as follows :    we start with a node for each component of @xmath36 .",
    "each crossing in @xmath0 , when smoothed , lies on two distinct components of @xmath36 ; for each positive ( respectively negative ) crossing of @xmath0 we connect the corresponding nodes by an edge decorated with @xmath38 ( respectively @xmath39 ) .",
    "note that @xmath37 by itself is not enough to recover the full khovanov chain complex of the diagram @xmath0 , but if we added extra data of an ordering of the edges at each node , we would be able to recover the full complex .    from @xmath37 we now form two other graphs :    we form a subgraph @xmath40 ( respectively @xmath41 ) from @xmath37 by removing all edges of @xmath37 decorated with a @xmath38 ( respectively @xmath39 ) .    [ maindefn ] we define the number @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the writhe of @xmath0 .    [ errordefn ]",
    "we define the number @xmath44    then we have    [ trees ] if @xmath45 then @xmath46 .",
    "in fact we can say more :    @xmath47    theorem [ trees ] enables us to improve on previously known easily - computable combinatorial lower bounds for the slice genus .",
    "we have :    [ benny ] @xmath48    which is stronger than the rudolph - bennequin inequalities as proved in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( for a nice discussion see @xcite ) .    of propositions",
    "[ posandneg ] , [ braid ] , and [ alternating ] .",
    "this is just a matter of checking that the condition @xmath45 of theorem [ trees ] holds in each case .",
    "this is only a non - trivial check for the case of @xmath0 being alternating .",
    "suppose @xmath0 is an alternating diagram .",
    "the complement of the oriented resolution @xmath36 is a number of regions of the plane .",
    "if @xmath0 is not the trivial diagram , there is a unique way to associate to each region either a @xmath38 or a @xmath39 such that only positive ( respectively negative ) crossings of @xmath0 occur in regions associated with a @xmath38 ( respectively @xmath39 ) and such that adjacent regions have different associated signs .",
    "see figure [ alt ] for an example .",
    "then each region with associated sign @xmath38 ( respectively @xmath39 ) corresponds to exactly one component of @xmath41 ( respectively @xmath49 ) . since there is one more region than there are circles of @xmath36 ( or equivalently nodes of @xmath37 ) we must have @xmath45 .     .",
    "we indicate which crossings are positive and which negative . on the right of the figure",
    "is the oriented resolution @xmath36 on which we indicate how to uniquely associate @xmath38 or @xmath39 to each component of the complement of @xmath36.,title=\"fig:\",width=355,height=480 ]    we note that proposition [ alternating ] gives a combinatorial formula for the rasmussen invariant of an alternating diagram .",
    "it is known @xcite that the rasmussen invariant of an alternating knot agrees with the signature of the knot , and there is also known @xcite a combinatorial formula for the signature of an alternating diagram .",
    "proposition [ alternating ] gives an equivalence between these two results .",
    "there is a nice topological interpretation of @xmath50 which is useful in computing it by hand :    form a graph @xmath51 which has a node for each component of @xmath49 and a node for each component of @xmath41 .",
    "each circle in @xmath36 is a member of exactly one component of @xmath49 and exactly one component of @xmath41 ; for each circle in @xmath36 let @xmath51 have an edge connecting the corresponding pair of nodes .",
    "then @xmath52 , the first betti number of @xmath51 .",
    "this follows from the connectedness of @xmath51 so that we have    @xmath53    just prior to posting on the arxiv , we heard from tomomi kawamura @xcite that she has independently obtained several of the results in this paper , using entirely different methods .",
    "we thank tetsuya abe and cornelia van cott for their comments on an earlier draft of this paper .",
    "we assume familiarity with the definition of the khovanov chain complex defined from a knot diagram @xmath0 , and with rasmussen s paper @xcite . we write @xmath54 for lee s perturbed chain complex with complex coefficients ( where the tqft is induced from the frobenius algebra @xmath55/(x^2 - 1)$ ] ) , with the @xmath56 representing the quantum filtration :",
    "@xmath57    and the superscript @xmath58 denoting the homological grading :    @xmath59    similarly we write @xmath60 for the homology of the chain complex @xmath61 .",
    "there is a distinguished subspace of @xmath62 which i shall write as @xmath63 ; @xmath36 being the oriented resolution of @xmath0 and @xmath64 being a shift in the quantum filtration by the writhe of @xmath0 . here",
    "one can think either of @xmath65 as being lee s tqft functor or of @xmath66 as being the perturbed khovanov homology of the ( @xmath67-crossing ) diagram @xmath36 .    by lee @xcite we know that    given a knot diagram @xmath0 with orientation @xmath68 , there exist @xmath69 such that @xmath70 furthermore , the homology @xmath60 is 2-dimensional and supported in homological grading @xmath71 with @xmath72 , [ { \\mathfrak{s}}_{{\\overline}{o } } ] > $ ] .",
    "there is an explicit description of these generators at the chain level :    [ generators ] the orientation @xmath68 on @xmath0 induces an orientation on @xmath36 . for each circle @xmath73 in @xmath36",
    "we give a invariant which is the mod 2 count of the number of circles in @xmath36 separating @xmath73 from infinity , to which we add @xmath67 ( respectively @xmath74 ) if @xmath73 has the counter - clockwise ( respectively clockwise ) orientation .",
    "we label @xmath73 with @xmath75 ( respectively @xmath76 ) if the invariant is @xmath67 ( respectively @xmath74 ) @xmath77 .",
    "this determines an element @xmath78 , @xmath79 being given in the same way using the opposite orientation @xmath80 on @xmath0 .",
    "we know that , in rasmussen s notation , @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the filtration grading of the highest filtered part of @xmath83 to contain @xmath84 $ ] ( or equivalently @xmath85 $ ] - this interchangeability is taken as understood from now on ) .",
    "this is the same as the filtration grading of the highest filtered part of @xmath86 containing @xmath84 $ ] .",
    "it follows that    [ ronen ] let @xmath87 be the projection onto the vector space summand . then    @xmath88    where @xmath89 is the filtration grading in @xmath90 of the highest filtered part containing @xmath91 $ ] .",
    "@xmath92 +    ( of theorem [ upperbound ] ) given a knot diagram @xmath0 with orientation @xmath68 , we write @xmath93 , @xmath94 for the number of positive , negative crossings of @xmath0 respectively so that the writhe @xmath95 . form the diagram @xmath96 by taking the oriented resolution at each of the positive crossings .",
    "note that diagram @xmath96 is also oriented with writhe @xmath97 .",
    "suppose there are @xmath98 components @xmath99 of @xmath96 ( where we mean components as a subset of the plane , so that the standard 2-crossing diagram of the hopf link would be considered as a single component , for example ) and suppose that @xmath100 has @xmath101 crossings for @xmath102 .",
    "we observe that , up to quantum filtration shift by @xmath103 , the map    @xmath104    can be identified with the map    @xmath105    this latter map is in fact @xmath106 where    @xmath107    is the @xmath108th differential in the chain complex @xmath109 and    @xmath110    is the identity map .",
    "inductively on @xmath111 we observe a canonical identification    @xmath112    now @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is either the element @xmath115 or @xmath116 where we use @xmath117 to stand for the induced orientation on the oriented resolution of @xmath100 .",
    "this is because the mod 2 invariant associated to each circle @xmath118 via definition [ generators ] differs by @xmath67 or @xmath74 from the invariant associated to @xmath119 via definition [ generators ] , and it is the same difference for all circles of @xmath120 .",
    "suppose the number of components of @xmath120 is @xmath121 .",
    "we observe that @xmath122 is the highest filtered part of @xmath123 to be non - zero and is @xmath74-dimensional .",
    "therefore by lemma 3.5 @xcite , @xmath124 $ ] has filtered degree less than or equal to @xmath125 in @xmath126 .",
    "we compute for @xmath89 in lemma [ ronen ] :    @xmath127    hence we have    @xmath128    ( of theorem [ trees ] ) given an oriented knot diagram @xmath0 , let @xmath129 be the mirror image of @xmath0 .",
