    "instead , they make the weaker assumptions that the experiment could have been performed @xmath9 times and that there was nothing special about the experiments actually performed .",
    "these assumptions , together with the observation about colored balls above , can be shown to imply that there exists a distribution @xmath8 such that @xmath10 \\approx \\int dm(\\lambda )    p_\\lambda[a_1]\\cdots p_\\lambda[a_k ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e. , the probability distribution @xmath11 $ ] behaves _ as if _ the experiments really were independent and there really were some objective prior @xmath8 .",

    "the possible states of @xmath0 particles are the conditional probability distributions @xmath18 $ ] that obey a _ no - signalling _ property , which ensures that the reduced state on a subset of the particles is always well - defined .",
    "our main result is that the joint state @xmath19=p[a_1 \\cdots a_k|x_1 \\cdots x_k]$ ] of @xmath2 particles randomly chosen from @xmath0 particles  or equivalently , the state of the first @xmath2 particles of a permutation - invariant state of @xmath0 particles  can be approximated by a convex combination of identical and independent conditional probability distributions , @xmath20 \\approx \\int dm(\\lambda ) p_\\lambda[a|x]^{\\times k }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and that the error in the approximation is bounded by @xmath21 in the appropriate distance measure , where @xmath22 is the number of different possible measurements .",

    "our result generalizes the finite de finetti theorem of diaconis and freedman , who proved for classical probability distributions ( @xmath25 ) that the error in the approximation is no more than @xmath26  @xcite  .",
    "the analogous bound within our framework is @xmath27 . restricting to _ adaptive _ measurements on individual particles , we are able to improve this bound to @xmath28  @xcite . ] .",
    "this paper is motivated by recent work on finite _ quantum _ de finetti theorems , i.e. , statements of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the @xmath2-particle reduced density matrix of a permutation - invariant density matrix of @xmath0 particles with state space of dimension @xmath31 , where the error is at most @xmath32 in the trace distance  @xcite   is permutation - invariant if @xmath33 for all permutations @xmath34 . ] .",
    "in fact , it is necessary that the error depends on @xmath31  @xcite , and so the quantum de finetti is not useful in applications where @xmath31 can not be bounded .",

    ", attempts have been made to lift the assumption of a fixed ( finite ) local dimension  @xcite . since quantum de finetti theorems",
    "are necessarily dimension - dependent , they can not be used in this setting . although our theorems do not directly lead to security proofs either , we regard them as a first step towards this goal .",
    "we also prove a finite quantum de finetti theorem for separable @xmath35 : in this case there is an approximation of the form in eq .   with error @xmath26 , _ independent _ of the dimension .",
    "we do not , however , know whether our techniques can be extended to prove the finite quantum de finetti theorem in full generality .",
    "the issue is that our theorem concerns conditional probability distributions that arise from measuring quantum states and not the quantum states themselves . if we take , for example , a tomographically complete set of measurements , the representation described in eq .",
    "will in general contain distributions @xmath23 $ ] that can not be obtained by performing the tomographic measurements on quantum states .",
    "one can , however , apply the argument of  @xcite to obtain the infinite quantum de finetti theorem and indeed an infinite de finetti theorem for any physical theory in what is known as the _ convex sets framework _",
    "@xcite ( see  @xcite for the details ) .",
    "another application of our work is to the study of classical channels .",
    "fuchs , schack and scudo have used the jamiolkowski isomorphism to transfer the infinite quantum de finetti theorem ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 )  @xcite to quantum channels  @xcite . since",
    "a conditional probability distribution can be viewed as a classical channel with probability distributions as input and output , our results also provide a de finetti theorem for classical channels .    _",
    "outline._our first task is to define an appropriate distance measure on states of @xmath2 particles in probabilistic theories , in order to quantify the error in eq .  .",
    "the distance between states should bound the probability of distinguishing them by measurement , and so we need to be clear about what measurement strategies are allowed .",
    "one possibility , which we explore in  @xcite , is to restrict to strategies where each of the @xmath2 particles is measured individually .",
    "but when the conditional probability distributions arise from making informationally complete local measurements on entangled quantum states , the resulting distance measure fails to bound the trace distance between the quantum states .",
    "in the next section we show how to define a ` good ' distance measure in which all noncontextual measurements are allowed , including all joint quantum - mechanical measurements .",
    "we then state and prove our results . in the last section",
    ", we explain the origin of the distance measure , the convex sets framework , which allows us to conclude with an open question on finite de finetti theorems in this more general setting .",
    "when we measure a quantum system , the probability of obtaining an outcome @xmath38 depends on which measurement @xmath39 we choose to perform on the system . it is usual to describe a quantum system using the formalism of density matrices , hilbert spaces , and so on , but we can also describe the system by specifying a conditional probability distribution @xmath14 $ ] , where we write @xmath40 $ ] for the distribution of measurement outcome @xmath41 given that measurement @xmath16 is performed   with effects @xmath42 ( satisfying @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) on a system in state @xmath46 , then the distribution of the measurement outcome @xmath41 is given by @xmath17 = { \\mathsf{tr}}\\left(\\rho e_{x , a}\\right)$ ] . ] . while a classical system can be described using an _ unconditional _ probability distribution , the same is not true for a quantum system , since measuring a quantum system disturbs it , eliminating our ability to make a second , incompatible , measurement on the same system .",
    "we are therefore motivated to describe the state of an abstract system ( not necessarily obeying quantum theory ) using a conditional probability distribution @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "we view the conditional probability distribution @xmath14 $ ] as the output distribution of a measurement that has been performed on system @xmath41 .",
    "alternatively , one can view @xmath14 $ ] as a channel that produces an output distribution @xmath40 $ ] on input @xmath16 . for this reason we refer to the measurement setting @xmath16 as the _ input _ and the measurement result @xmath15 as the _ output_. generalizing from conditional probability distributions of one system",
    ", we shall consider a conditional probability distribution @xmath18=p[a_1\\cdots a_n|x_1 \\cdots x_n]$ ] , which describes an abstract system composed of @xmath0 subsystems , which we call particles .",
    "we need to be able to describe the state of a subset @xmath47 of the particles . taking the marginal of a conditional probability distribution",
    "@xmath18 $ ] yields a conditional distribution @xmath48 $ ] , where the outputs at the particles in @xmath49 depends on the inputs at all @xmath0 sites . in order to trace out the particles that are not in @xmath49 entirely , rather than just the outputs obtained from measuring them , we need another notion , that of a conditional probability distribution being _ no - signalling_.    a conditional distribution @xmath18 $ ] is _ no - signalling _ if for all subsets @xmath50 with complements @xmath51 @xmath52 { \\mathrel{\\mathop:}=}\\sum_{a_{\\bar{{\\mathcal{i } } } } }",
    "p[a^n = a^n|x^n = x^n]\\ ] ] is independent of @xmath53 for all @xmath54 and all @xmath55 .",
    "the terminology derives from the following fact : if we divide the @xmath0 parties into two groups , @xmath49 and @xmath56 , then , provided @xmath18 $ ] is no - signalling , it is impossible for the group @xmath49 to send a signal to the group of @xmath56 just by changing their inputs .",
    "not all conditional probability distributions are no - signalling ; for example , @xmath57 = [ a_1=x_2][a_2=x_1]$ ] ( where @xmath58 $ ] is @xmath59 if @xmath60 is true and @xmath61 otherwise ) is signalling .",
    "we note that any conditional probability distribution that arises from making local measurements on a quantum state is no - signalling .",
    "the no - signalling requirement is the minimal assumption necessary to ensure that state of any subset of particles is well - defined .",
    "the goal of this paper is to approximate by product distributions a no - signalling conditional probability distribution on @xmath2 particles arising from a symmetric conditional probability distribution on @xmath0 systems , so we need to introduce a notion of distance for conditional probability distributions .",
    "this distance measure should generalize the classical variational distance , which is equal to the maximum probability of distinguishing two probability distributions , and the quantum trace distance , which is equal to the maximal probability of distinguishing two quantum states . in order to define a _ trace distance _ for no - signalling conditional probability distributions we therefore need to determine what measurement strategies",
    "can be used to distinguish two conditional probability distributions .",
    "in fact , there are three natural sets of measurement strategies for conditional probability distributions , each of which induces a distance measure on conditional probability distributions .",
    "we will work with the largest of these sets giving the strongest notion of a distance , for if we can show that two conditional probability distributions are almost indistinguishable using a particular set of measurements , it will trivially follow that they are also almost indistinguishable when only a subset of those measurements is allowed .",
    "let us start by introducing the three sets .",
    "an _ individual measurement _ is a distribution @xmath62 $ ] on the inputs that maps the conditional probability distribution to the unconditional probability distribution @xmath63 = p[a^k|x^k]p[x^k]$ ] .",
    "such a measurement can be carried out by measuring each subsystem individually .",
    "note that individual measurements also make sense if we drop the condition that @xmath18 $ ] is no - signalling . since we restrict to no - signalling conditional probability distributions ,",
    "a larger class of measurements is possible and indeed needed for applications .",
    "suppose the conditional distribution @xmath64 $ ] is no - signalling .",
    "we start by writing @xmath65&=p[a_1|x_1x_2=x_1x_2]p[a_2|a_1,x_1x_2=x_1x_2]\\\\ & = p[a_1|x_1=x_1]p[a_2|a_1,x_1x_2=x_1x_2],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we made use of the no - signalling principle , eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) , in the second line .",
    "this provides an operational means to sample from @xmath66 $ ] : we first sample @xmath67 from the distribution @xmath68 $ ] , then sample @xmath69 from @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "the important point is that a no - signalling conditional probability distribution can provide the output on system 1 before specifying which input is chosen for system 2 .",
    "therefore the following _ adaptive measurement _ on @xmath64 $ ] is possible : input @xmath71 , obtain @xmath67 , and choose an input @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is an arbitrary function .",
    "such a strategy can lead to a higher probability of distinguishing two no - signalling conditional probability distributions , compared to individual strategies   and define @xmath74 = \\frac12\\ , [ a_1 + a_2   = x_1 \\and x_2 \\pmod 2].$ ] this distribution is known as a nonlocal box  @xcite and one can easily check that it is no - signalling .",
    "we wish to distinguish this distribution from the distribution @xmath75 $ ] , defined by @xmath76 = \\frac{1}{2}\\ , [ a_2=1].$ ] ( this is an unconditional product distribution where the first bit is random and the second bit is always one . ) for every setting of @xmath71 and @xmath77 , @xmath78 = 1/2 $ ] , and thus @xmath79 and @xmath80 can not be perfectly distinguished by making a measurement on both systems in parallel .",
    "but if we allow adaptive strategies , then we can distinguish @xmath79 and @xmath80 perfectly .",
    "for instance , set @xmath81 and then set @xmath82 , so that we have @xmath83 and it follows that @xmath84 = 1 $ ] . since @xmath85=0 $ ] , we conclude that we can distinguish @xmath79 and @xmath80 perfectly . ] .    as in most of the paper",
    "we draw intuition from quantum - mechanical correlations .",
    "it is a well - established fact that the distinguishability of quantum states depends on whether individual or adaptive measurement strategies are considered . in the quantum case ,",
    "furthermore , it is possible to apply a joint measurement to all @xmath2 systems at once , a class of measurement which strictly contains adaptive measurements and can lead to strictly higher distinguishability . _ quantum data hiding _ is an important application of this phenomenon  @xcite .    in defining joint operations on no - signalling conditional probability distributions ,",
    "we essentially wish to allow all possible measurements whose outcomes behave like probability distributions .",
    "motivated by this , we think of a no - signalling conditional probability distribution @xmath19 $ ] as a vector in a real @xmath86-dimensional space and consider linear functions from this space to a real @xmath87-dimensional space .",

    "clearly , individual and adaptive strategies belong to the set of general measurements , but it includes strictly more strategies , too .",

    "not all conditional probability distributions can be obtained by making local measurements on quantum states .",

    "effects are also functions mapping states to probabilities , and these functions should be affine so that they are compatible with preparing convex combinations .",

    "the complication is that the space @xmath199 is a banach space but not a hilbert space and there are multiple ways to define a norm on the tensor product space , consistent with the norm on @xmath199 .",
