    "over last two decades , optical whispering - gallery - mode ( wgm ) microresonators ( or microcavities ) @xcite with high quality factors and small mode volumes have promised lab - on - a - chip applications ranging from fundamental physics to various photonic devices , such as nonlinear optics @xcite , cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite , cavity optomechanics @xcite , low - threshold microlasers @xcite and highly sensitive optical biosensors @xcite . in these applications ,",
    "traditionally light is coupled into the wgm microcavities by evanescent couplers , such as prisms @xcite , tapered fibers @xcite and angle - polished fibers @xcite , which have been validated to be highly efficient . in all of these coupling configurations ,",
    "the microcavities are typically separated from the couplers by a distance of subwavelength because the evanescent fields of wgms extend over a very short range . the use of the evanescent couplers , however , is not suitable in some important applications .",
    "for example , a higher - index - material microcavity @xcite can not be efficiently excited by the tapered fiber due to phase mismatching .",
    "in addition , the external couplers degrade high - q factors ( defined as @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the photon frequency and @xmath2 is its intracavity lifetime ) in the case of the over - coupling regime , and they are not convenient in low - temperature chambers .",
    "it has been demonstrated that wgms in a specially designed deformed cavity can be directly excited by a free - space optical beam @xcite .",
    "this direct free - space coupling is of importance because it is robust and requires less rigorous experimental condition than the evanescent couplers mentioned above .",
    "this efficient free - space coupling originates from breaking of rotational symmetry in deformed microcavities , which produces a highly directional emission assisted by the dynamical tunneling , different from the isotropic nature of a circular wgm cavity @xcite .",
    "according to the time reversion , _",
    "i.e. _ , the reversibility of light path , free - space beams at certain positions are expected to couple into the high - q modes via chaotic modes when they are on resonance .",
    "so far , this type of free - space coupling technique has been demonstrated experimentally to reach a resonant efficiency exceeding @xmath3 @xcite . a straightforward method to characterize",
    "free - space coupling is to study its transmission property , _",
    "e.g. _ , transmission spectrum . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the dynamical tunneling properties between the chaotic modes and the regular modes in detail , and predict transmission spectra of the free - space coupling by employing a quantum scattering theory .",
    "it is found that the spectrum can behave asymmetrically as fano - like lineshape @xcite , in good agreement with our recent experimental observation @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we present the mechanism of dynamical tunneling - assisted coupling , and introduce a quantum scattering theory to predict a general transmission in free space .",
    "it is found that the free - space transmission spectrum includes the contribution from both the off - resonance background and the on - resonance modulation . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we study the off - resonance background transmission in the absence of the high - q regular mode , corresponding to the unperturbed scattering .",
    "the off - resonance background transmission spectrum shows periodic modulations , which is in good agreement with both the numerical simulation and experimental results . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , the on - resonance transmission spectra are studied in detail .",
    "it is revealed that they depend strongly on ( i ) the additional phase when light travels in chaos trajectories and ( ii ) the rate of dynamical tunneling .",
    "section  [ phys ] rigourously explains the chaotic states and the coupling strength , with which we deduce the condition of highest excitation efficiency .",
    "section  [ sec5 ] further investigates the kam barriers which is predominant in the dynamical tunneling process .",
    "section  [ summary ] is a short summary of the paper .",
    "and @xmath4 are the polar coordinates in the cavity plane .",
    "red arrow denotes the laser beam .",
    "inset : false color illustration a resonant mode distribution obtained with wave simulation .",
    "the two black arrows denote the dominantly directional emission toward 180@xmath5 far - field direction .",
    "the strength outside the cavity is magnified for a clear show.,width=283 ]    without loss of generality , here we consider a two - dimensional deformed cavity made of silica with refractive index @xmath6 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which has the boundary defined in polar coordinates as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent size and deformation parameters , respectively .",
    "cavity shape parameters are set as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 . when @xmath14 , a highly directional far - field universal pattern of high - q modes has been predicted @xcite and demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "this emission characteristic is clearer by plotting the near - field pattern , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "it can be seen that the two major emission positions are at @xmath15,and @xmath16 , corresponding to refractive escape from counter - clockwise ( ccw ) and clockwise ( cw ) modes , respectively .",
    "thus , we expect with a time reversed way , an excitation beam focused on the primary emission position at @xmath15 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , can eventually excite the cw resonant modes . to quantitatively study this chaos - assisted process",
    ", we use a quantum scattering theory to model the transmission , from which the coupling characteristic of the high - q modes can be obtained .    before studying the transmission spectrum , we first present the mechanism of dynamical tunneling - assisted coupling .",
    "poincar surface of section ( psos ) provides a simple and intuitive way to model the ray dynamics in deformed microcavities by recording the angular position @xmath4 and the incident angle @xmath17 of the rays , similar to billiards in quantum chaos . except for an integrable ellipse - shaped cavity",
    ", the deformed microcavity has a mixed phase space including three types of structures : kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) tori , islands , and chaos sea , corresponding to quasi - periodicity , periodicity , and chaos motion of ray trajectories @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "kam tori separate the psos into disjoint regions . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , high - q modes are usually localized in the regular regions bounded by a kam torus @xcite .",
    "for such a localized high - q mode , the excitation by a free - space beam is primarily attributed to two channels : ( i ) _ angular momentum tunneling _ and ( ii ) _ dynamical tunneling via chaos _",
    "it has been demonstrated that the dynamical tunneling dominates , since the lifetime of photons that refract into the deformed cavity greatly increases along chaotic trajectories @xcite .    .",
    "the orange dotted line stands for a kam torus .",
    "( b ) and ( c ) are normalized husimi projection of the resonant mode and the excitation state , respectively.,width=264 ]    in the system consisting of a microcavity and unbounded medium outside , the state @xmath18 which describes the electromagnetic field excited by the incident beam satisfies stationary schrdinger equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 stands for the system hamiltonian .",
    "as mentioned above , not only chaotic modes but the regular mode can also be excited by an appropriate free - space beam thanks to the dynamical tunneling .",
    "this can be demonstrated by plotting the husimi projection @xcite of the excitation state @xmath21 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) .",
    "thus @xmath21 can be expanded as a linear combination of chaotic mode @xmath22 and regular mode @xmath23 @xcite , with the form @xmath24 throughout this paper , we use regular mode and chaotic mode to describe uncoupled states , and dynamical tunneling is the interaction between an uncoupled regular mode and uncoupled chaotic modes .",
    "the system hamiltonian satisfies    @xmath25    here @xmath26 and @xmath1 are the frequencies of the resonant regular mode and the incident light , respectively .",
    "the coupling coefficient between @xmath22 and @xmath27 , governed by the dynamical tunneling , is described by @xmath28 .",
    "the decay rate @xmath29 consists of the intrinsic loss and the chaos - assisted tunneling loss . in detail , the intrinsic decay rate @xmath30 is attributed to radiation , material absorption and scattering losses in the cavity , while the chaos - assisted decay rate @xmath31 describes tunneling into the chaotic modes other than @xmath32 .",

    "( [ aw ] ) , @xmath50 describes the excitation probability by the free - space beam , from which we can deduce that the fwhm ( full width at half maximum ) of the regular mode is expressed as @xmath51 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath52 remains unchanged when the free - space coupling efficiency changes @xcite , which is distinct with the fiber taper coupling .",
    "finally , the transmission spectrum is calculated as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a suitable transmission operator connecting @xmath55 and @xmath34 , and @xmath56 describes the probability of transmitted signal @xcite . to get a more general expression , we introduce a dimensionless frequency detuning defined by @xmath57 and the ratio @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , the transmission is simplified to @xmath59 represents the crucial lineshape parameter of the transmission spectrum @xmath60 , taking the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 . to give a clear understanding ,",
    "we consider two extreme cases .",
    "\\(i ) in classical mechanics where dynamical tunneling is forbidden , the regular mode can not be excited .",
    "thus there is no interaction between the regular mode and the chaotic mode ( @xmath63 ) , and the coefficients @xmath64 as well as @xmath65 . in this case the transmission spectra yields to @xmath66 which can be regarded as the unperturbed scattering . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we will discuss the unperturbed scattering , which is of much concerning about the lineshape near resonance .",
    "\\(ii ) when the intrinsic loss of regular mode is negligible and the regular mode is fully excited by a phase conjugation wave of its emission pattern , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( or namely , ` complete excitation ' , which will be discussed specifically in sec .",
    "[ phys ] ) , the transmission yields a standard fano resonance @xmath69",
    "we now investigate the background scattering in the absence of the high - q regular mode .",
    "it has been reported that non - resonant pumping in deformed microcavity can be well modeled by ray dynamics @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the unperturbed transmission is studied in wave optics , and it results from the interference between two components , according to the schema shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) : ( i ) the direct transmitted amplitude @xmath70 , and ( ii ) the dissipated amplitude @xmath71 via diffusing inside the cavity . to give a clear picture of the interference",
    ", we apply transmission matrix , and the amplitudes are indicated by @xmath72 the intracavity fields @xmath73 and @xmath74 are related by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a coefficient including the loss and the phase change in a round trip .",
    "the transition matrix element is then given by @xmath77 here @xmath71 and @xmath78 can be understood as the equivalent amplitude and phase difference of forward - emitted field from the cavity , respectively .",
    "hence , the unperturbed transmission takes the form @xmath79 in a wide frequency width the phase difference @xmath78 can be simplified as @xmath80 with @xmath81 representing the equivalent chaotic path length of the light inside the cavity .",
    "thus the transmission spectrum shows periodic modulations in good agreement with numerically simulated transmission , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) . in experiment",
    ", we focus the incident beam on the periphery of a deformed microtoroid with the principle radius @xmath82 @xmath83 , and the waist of the beam is about @xmath84 @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig3](c ) reveals that the experimentally detected transmission also oscillates periodically .",
    "note that the narrow fluctuations in the transmission are due to the fabry - perot oscillations between two lens . from experimental results",

    "the phase shift between the two amplitudes varies from 0 to @xmath87.,width=283 ]    we turn to the study of the on - resonance transmission .",
    "it is noted that the direct excitation probability of high - q regular modes via evanescent field is negligible due to angular momentum mismatch , so that the amplitude of @xmath88 in eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) has minor contribution of the transmission . in this case",

    "( [ gaussianq ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) , the on - resonance transmission can be deduced . in the following , we will show that the lineshape of the transmission spectrum is determined by @xmath92 , which primarily depends on @xmath78 , while the modulation depth relies on the relative coupling strength described by @xmath93 .",
    "figures [ fig4](a)-[fig4](h ) plot calculated transmission spectra against the phase difference @xmath78 , which experience symmetric lorentz absorption dips , asymmetric fano - like lineshapes and symmetric electromagnetically - induced - transparency ( eit)-like peaks as @xmath78 varies from @xmath94 to @xmath95 . from fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , the transmission is a result of interference between two components : the direct transmitted light and the emitted light from the cavity , and @xmath78 actually describes the phase difference between them .",
    "interestingly , the on - resonance transmission appears a symmetric dip on the background where the two components constructively interfere ( @xmath96 in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) ) , while it switches to an eit - like peak when they destructively interfere ( @xmath97 in fig .",
    "[ fig4](e ) ) .",
    "this is because when on resonance , the chaotic modes refractively excited by the incident beam can couple to the regular mode via dynamical tunneling , which results in a phase shift as energy couples back to the chaotic modes .",
    "hence , although the background components constructively ( destructively ) interfere , such counteraction adds a destructive modulation to the chaotic modes , reflecting a dip ( peak ) on the transmission .",
    "as discussed above , the fano - resonance transmission spectra can be regarded as the modulation of the high - q mode on the off - resonance background .",
    "such modulation depends strongly on the coupling strength @xmath43 between the chaotic modes and the regular mode according to eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) .",
    "here we study the two special cases : eit - like lineshapes and lorentz dips .",
    "as shown in the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) , the modulation of the regular mode to the transmission spectrum is minor when @xmath98 . in this case , the excitation probability is extremely low .",
    "as @xmath93 decreases ( _ i.e. _ , the dynamical tunneling is enhanced ) , the height of the eit peak increases monotonically , where the off - resonance backgrounds are lifted to the same level . when the loss described by @xmath99 is negligible compared with the coupling strength @xmath43 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath68 , the eit peak reaches its maximum .",
    "similarly , fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) shows that the dynamical - tunneling - induced dips become more obvious by enhancing the tunneling , as expected .",
    "ghz and @xmath86 , and with @xmath93 varying from 0 to 60 , for ( a ) eit - like lineshape and ( b ) lorentz - like lineshape .",
    "the background is set to the same level for each graph.,width=294 ]    at the beginning of sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we have presented the chaotic mode @xmath22 . in this section , we will further investigate the meaning of the chaotic mode and the coupling strength to a regular mode @xmath35 .",
    "to study this case in a general way , we expand the chaotic mode as a linear combination of an orthogonal set at a certain frequency . using @xmath100",
    "to represent the normalized @xmath101-th orthogonal mode , we have @xmath102 where @xmath103 stands for the corresponding weight . from the coupled mode theory ,",
    "we obtain @xmath104 here @xmath105 and @xmath106 represent the electric field of @xmath107 and @xmath35 , respectively , with @xmath108 being the coupling strength between them .",
    "thus , the equivalent coupling strength @xmath109 is derived as @xmath110 then the reduced coupling strength between @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be obtained as @xmath111 , according to eq .",
    "( [ kappa ] ) .    once the high - q regular mode @xmath35  is excited , it can dynamically tunnel into all the chaotic modes including both @xmath112 and @xmath33 .",
    "since the chaotic modes are continuum , with first markov approximation , this tunneling can be considered as a spontaneous decay process of the regular mode , described by the coefficient@xmath113 thus the decay rate into @xmath114 is @xmath115 hence , to optimize the free - space coupling efficiency , according to cauchy inequality , the coefficients @xmath103 satisfies @xmath116 under this condition , it is found @xmath117 . neglecting the intrinsic loss @xmath118 induced by scattering and material absorption , we have @xmath119 , which means the incident light is exactly a time - reversed way of the emission light from the regular mode @xmath35 .",
    "it is also in agreement with the second extreme case discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , that the ` complete excitation ' condition requires the incident light as the phase conjugation wave of the emission pattern .",
    "finally , we discuss how the kam tori , behaving as barriers @xcite , can result in a phase shift in dynamical tunneling .",
    "this phase shift is crucial to give rise to the fano resonance . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , kam tori separate the phase space into disconnected regions , between which transport is forbidden classically , but permitted in quantum mechanics @xcite , known as dynamical tunneling . to evaluate the barrier effect",

    "without loss of the physics , we investigate the orbits in a circular microcavity .",

    "the solid and the dashed curves correspond to the cases of silica ( n=1.45 ) and gaas ( n=3.3 ) microcavities , respectively .",
    "( b)-(c ) husimi projections of the excitation state inside the cavity at non - resonant frequency with the deformation parameter @xmath9 of the cavity setting as @xmath128 and @xmath129 , respectively .",
    "these two figures are plotted in the same scale .",
    "orange dotted curves and red solid lines denote kam tori and critical - refraction lines.,width=264 ]    extending @xmath120 to the range of positive real numbers , from the classical relation @xmath130 and the non - relativity approximation @xmath131 , the effective potential of the orbits takes the form @xmath132 the effective potentials for different meterials ( silica and gaas ) are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) .",
    "thus , an photon at critical refraction line @xmath133 has the same potential as a free - space photon , in agreement with the fresnel s law .",
    "the difference in the potentials of various orbits leads to tunneling .    in deformed microcavities ,",
    "kam tori are the residue of these invariant orbits , and they perform as barriers in quantum mechanics . by plotting the humisi projection of cavities of different deformations shown in figs .",
    "[ fig6](b)-(c ) , we can find that the transportation to high - q modes are governed by the kam tori .",
    "our simulation also reveals that more light can be localized in the cavity with a larger deformation , thus leading a higher probability to couple into regular high - q modes .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented the dynamical tunneling - assisted coupling mechanism to interpret how a free - space laser beam excites the high - q modes in deformed microcavities .",
    "the deformed microcavity has a mixed phase space , where the high - q regular modes lie in regular regions .",
    "lifetime of photons refracting into the cavity increases due to chaotic trajectories , which contributes to the enhanced excitation of regular modes via _ chaos - assisted dynamical tunneling_. a quantum scattering theory is employed to describe the picture and to obtain the free - space transmission spectra .",
    "unlike evanescent coupling with a waveguide where the transmission spectra behave symmetrically , this model predicts three types of transmission , _",
    "i.e. _ , asymmetric fano - like , symmetric eit - like and lorentz dip lineshapes , depending on the phase difference related to the fluctuation of background transmission",
    ". it is found that the fano resonance is attributed to the phase shift occurring in the dynamical tunneling into classical - forbidden regions .",
    "our results provide a general method to evaluate the coupling strength between the chaos and the regular mode from the transmission spectra , which can be further extended to the quantitative study of the dynamical tunneling process .",
