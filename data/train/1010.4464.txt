    "the relative change in the magnetization direction of the free layer with respect to the pinned layer is translated to a time - varying voltage via the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) . currently , the power transducing yield of an oscillating vortex in the nanocontact configuration is greater than that of uniform ferromagnetic modes , due to the nearly complete rotation of the magnetization translated by gmr .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a pivotal result from both theory and experiment  @xcite is the quasi - linear frequency tunability with the current .",
    "the present theoretical understanding is that an almost fixed trajectory is maintained while the vortex gyrates under distinct currents .",
    "we have studied this orbital stability in a previous work  @xcite , employing a microwave interferometer to insert mhz - modulated currents ( @xmath3 ) into the device and hence study the resulting vortex dynamics .",
    "the agility , i.e. , the shortest time it takes for the vortex to hop and stabilize from one frequency to another was found to be below a maximum upper bound value of @xmath4 , comparable to the agility of state of the art voltage - controlled oscillators  @xcite .",
    "studies on the ability of modulating nanocontact stos are necessary assessments for a more compatible integration with the current silicon complementary metal - oxide semiconductor industry . for instance , by rapidly swapping the magnetic vortex motion between two well - defined frequencies is a major asset for developments on telecommunication devices operating at the low frequency regime .    here , we investigate the implementation of a frequency shift keying ( fsk ) modulation scheme of a vortex - based nanocontact oscillator over a large current range . upon the mhz - current modulation the vortex experiences two distinct current states yielding largely separated frequencies . for currents modulated at low pulse repetition frequencies ( prf ) ,",

    "increasing the prf leads to a richer spectra , and it is no longer that easy to identify the two different gyration modes at first sight . the transition occurs for a prf of @xmath0 ( fig .  [ fig : three]c ) , when @xmath48 .",
    "sidebands are now well separated from the main peaks @xmath20 and @xmath22 , and appear as multiplets . an even stronger distortion is observed for higher values of prf , at which almost the entire spectra get flooded with sidebands , as in panel  [ fig : three]d for a prf of @xmath49 .",
    "remarkably , now the current is changed as rapidly as every @xmath50 , which corresponds to merely ten full gyrations of the vortex around the nanocontact .",

    "under the influence of a small prf value  * ( b ) * , such as @xmath24 , the main mode splits in @xmath20 and @xmath22 branches that can be clearly resolved in frequency with an average peak - to - peak separation of @xmath37 . for a high prf value as @xmath49 in  * ( d ) *",
    "the frequency separation is no longer clear and the spectra becomes saturated with multiplets from generated sidebands .",
    "the transition for the frequency resolution occurs for a prf of @xmath0 in  * ( c)*. [ fig : three ] ]",
    "the discussion of the experimental spectra requires a brief analysis of the expected spectrum of a frequency shift keyed vortex oscillator . in the ideal case",
    ", the frequency transition would be infinitely abrupt at the current changes and it would be continuous in phase . in practice , we observe the transition being strongly dependent on how fast the vortex is modulated , i.e. , a relation between the prf and linewidths @xmath39 and @xmath40 .      when @xmath52 , @xmath40 , the phase memory is not preserved between each of the oscillating half - period .",

    "these two conditions are satisfied for a prf of 5 mhz,(fig .",
    "[ fig : three]b ) . in such case , each power spectral density should consist of the sum of two individually - symmetric sets of sidebands ( multiplets ) .",
    "each multiplet has the following features :    * the multiplets are essentially triplets centered around @xmath20 and @xmath22 , with sidebands at @xmath63 , @xmath20 and @xmath64 ( idem for @xmath22 ) , with intensities @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath65 ; * there are no sidebands at @xmath67 and @xmath68 , as well as , for every even number of @xmath69 ( idem for @xmath22 ) . *",
    "the next sideband peaks are at @xmath70 ( idem for @xmath22 ) with @xmath71 , but they carry such a small power of @xmath72 that they should hardly be observable .    these expectations can be compared with experimental spectra ( fig .",
