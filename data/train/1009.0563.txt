    "the thinner slabs can still give us the repulsive force but at smaller distance , e.g. , for @xmath84 , a repulsive force appears when @xmath127 . in other words , if we want to demonstrate the casimir force experimentally , @xmath126 thickness slab is enough to observe all the phenomena , assuming the validity of the emt , which is doubtful for such short distances , and no microstructure effect . @xcite",
    "[ 29 ] presents a test of the effective medium approximation ( ema ) for chiral metamaterials ( as also used in this present paper ) against numerical calculations that include the microstructures .",
    "a numerical proof was presented @xcite that the effective homogeneous approximation breaks down when the separation distance between the two plates becomes comparable to the size of the unit cell of the chiral metamaterial making the two plates . on the contrary ,",
    "we have shown in the present manuscript and in our previous work [ 10,11 ] , that chirality makes a repulsive contribution to the casimir force .",
    "our proof @xcite is based on the constitutive equations connecting the maxwell vectors ; these equations are definitely valid in the regime @xmath128 , where @xmath36 is the unit cell size of the chiral metamaterial , @xmath129 is the thickness of the plates , and @xmath0 is the separation between the plates . by making @xmath36 small enough , we can satisfy the double inequality @xmath130 , where @xmath99 is a separation distance , such that the casimir force is appreciable including the chiral repulsive contribution to it .",
    "we have shown in the present paper that the combination of plates of finite thickness with appropriate background substantially facilitates the satisfaction of the double inequality .",
    "thus we argue that , because the present manuscript and ref . [ 29 ] consider very different situations , there is no contradiction whatsoever between the two , as explained in detail below .",
    "previously it has been shown @xcite that two semi - infinite , homogeneous , and isotropic chiral media separated by a finite - thickness vacuum slab will experience a repulsive casimir force between one another  or at least a significant reduction of the attractive casimir force  at small separations if the chirality of the embedding media becomes large enough .",
    "it has been speculated , that such chiral materials could at least , in principle , be implemented by chiral metamaterials in the homogeneous effective medium limit ( i.e. , where the ema is valid ) . the major contribution to the casimir force comes from frequencies and wave vectors of order of magnitude comparable to the inverse separation of the chiral media ; it is in this region at least where the implementation of the chiral metamaterials should allow ema .",
    "now , from here chiral casimir repulsion has been further investigated in at least two directions :    \\(i ) assume an existing chiral metamaterial structure with a given unit cell size ; it has been investigated to what extent a repulsive contribution to the casimir force can be found ( in simulations ) for a discreet metamaterial .",
    "this is the topic of ref .",
    "[ 29 ] where only a minimal repulsive contribution to the casimir force was found at separation much larger than the unit cell size of the metamaterial  a regime where also the repulsive contribution in the analytical calculation of homogeneous semi - infinite media would become negligible .",
    "not surprisingly , for separations comparable in order of magnitude to the unit cell size of the metamaterial , it was determined the discrete interactions between the constituents of the metamaterials dominate the force and no chiral repulsion could be observed because the metamaterials do not behave anymore as homogeneous media at the relevant frequencies and wave vectors .",
    "theoretically , this problem could be easily corrected by just making sure the structural length scale , i.e. the assumed unit cell size , is small compared to the separation maintaining the validity of the ema at the relevant frequencies and wave vectors . of course ,",
    "in reality this could be a problem because there are current practical limits to the nano - fabrication of the metamaterial structures ( e.g. , for repulsion at 1 m separation the structural length scale of the metamaterial should be well below 100 nm to ensure homogeneous effective medium behavior ) .",
    "the effect of finite thickness was not studied in [ 29 ]  the media were just chosen thick enough to behave as if they where in fact semi - infinite .",
    "\\(ii ) in this manuscript we follow a very different direction .",
    "we keep the assumptions of homogeneous isotropic chiral media and investigate the question how a finite thickness of the semi - infinite chiral media , terminated by air or metal , will affect the sign and magnitude of the casimir force as well as its scaling with the separation between the media .",
    "we consider the homogeneity and isotropy of the chiral materials as given ; hence , the implementation by any to - be - designed chiral metamaterial as a technical problem that can be considered independently .",
    "we believe this investigation provides valuable information about the physical interplay between casimir repulsion and attraction brought about by these boundary conditions and is relevant , if an effectively homogeneous metamaterial implementation is fabricated .",
    "so , in summary , the present work and ref . [ 29 ] do not contradict each other but shed light on the possibility of a repulsive or reduced magnitude casimir force from different angles .",
    "we believe the approach taken and results presented here are independent of ref . [ 29 ] , not a mere extension of previous work [ 10,11 ] , and provide new results for finite - thickness effective medium slabs .",
    "the discussion of scaling of the casimir force with separation for the different regimes of thin versus thick finite chiral media slabs , the observation of stable equilibrium points , and the discussion of the effects of different terminations / substrates are unique and important results presented in this manuscript .    finally , the research reported in this manuscript is in no way `` invalidated '' by the results reported in ref . [ 29 ] .",
    "this previous publication [ 29 ] only asserts that once the separation between the chiral media implemented by chiral metamaterials becomes comparable to the structural length scale of the metamaterials , discrete interactions become dominant and the repulsive casimir force component expected form homogeneous chiral media ceases to exist .",
    "theoretically , the repulsive component to the casimir force should still exist at any given separation between the chiral media , if only the structural length scale is chosen small enough to ensure validity of the ema at the relevant frequencies and wave vectors as explained above .",
    "here , we give a physical explanation regarding the casimir force behaviors shown above : for large distances , the main contribution to the casimir force comes from the frequencies @xmath131.@xcite since @xmath132 is small , the main contribution region comes from low frequencies . for the low frequency waves , the finite thickness of the slab is much less than the wavelengths ; therefore , the effective optical parameters of the slab / substrate approach those of the substrate .",
    "if the substrate is vacuum , the effective optical parameters of the finite slab approach to those of vacuum ; therefore , the casimir energy of the finite slab with no substrate decreases faster than the traditional casimir force between two semi - infinite media . therefore , for the casimir force between a semi - infinite drude metal and a finite slab without substrate , the @xmath0 dependence for large @xmath0 is @xmath1 ; and for the casimir force between two identical finite chiral slabs without substrate , the @xmath0 dependence is @xmath3 .",
    "this behavior of the @xmath0 dependence is the same as that in the ordinary slabs.@xcite if the substrate is drude metal , the effective optical parameters of the finite slab / substrate for large distances approach to those of drude metal ; therefore , at very large distances , every force approaches to that of the interaction between two semi - infinite drude metal media , i.e. , it is always attractive force at large distance . for short distances",
    ", @xmath132 is large .",
    "the main contribution region will come from high frequencies ( short wavelengths ) .",
    "the influence of the substrate on the finite slab will be small .",
    "therefore , for short distances the slab / substrate system tends to behave as a semi - infinite slab .",
    "the interesting behavior appears at intermediate distances for the drude / magnetic slab / drude system ( see figs .",
    "1(c ) and 1(d ) ) where the repulsive character of the drude / slab subsystem competes with the attractive subsystem drude / drude .",
    "that is why the magnetic slab with a drude metal substrate can give us the equilibrium point at the intermediate distance .",
    "we repeat that for short distances , @xmath132 is large . hence , the influence of the substrate on the finite slab will be small .",
    "therefore , the finite slab can be considered as a semi - infinite object . as a result",
    ", every curve goes to the same value at very small distances .",
    "a similar conclusion was given in ref .",
    "a similar equilibrium point behavior to that shown in the inset of fig.1(c ) can also be obtained between two dielectric slabs , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , sandwiching another liquid @xmath8 and satisfying the condition of @xmath9 . for the case of two chiral slabs without substrate ,",
    "the attractive contribution for large distances ( i.e. , for low frequencies ) is smaller than that of semi - infinite chiral media due to the vacuum substrate , while the repulsive forces at short distances , i.e. , for high frequencies almost do not depend on the thickness @xmath2 ; therefore , it is easier to obtain the repulsive force , when the latter appears at short distances .",
    "thus for the force between two chiral slabs with drude metal substrate , because the repulsive contribution comes at very short distances , i.e. , for high frequencies , the finite - thickness slab does not influence the repulsive casimir force too much until @xmath4 .",
    "in this paper , we used the extended lifshitz theory to study the repulsive casimir force between a semi - infinite drude metal and a finite magnetic slab with or without substrate . for no substrate",
    ", we found that at the large distances , the @xmath0 dependence of the force is @xmath1 ; for the drude metal substrate , an equilibrium point appears at intermediate distances .",
    "the thickness of the slab can tune the position of this equilibrium point .",
    "we also study the repulsive casimir force between two identical chiral slabs with and without substrate . for no substrate",
    ", we found that the finite slabs repel each other at short distances , while for large distances the @xmath0 dependence of the attractive force is @xmath3 .",
    "for the drude metal substrate , we found that the finite thickness of the slab @xmath2 does not influence the repulsive force at short distances too much until @xmath4 .",
