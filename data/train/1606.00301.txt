    "<S> topological mechanics and phononics have recently emerged as an exciting field of study . here </S>",
    "<S> we introduce and study generalizations of the three - dimensional pyrochlore lattice that have topologically protected edge states and weyl lines in their bulk phonon spectra , which lead to zero surface modes that flip from one edge to the opposite as a function of surface wavenumber .    mechanical lattices with a perfect balance between the number of degrees of freedom and the number of constraints ( springs ) with unit cells of appropriate internal geometry exhibit zero - frequency modes at boundaries even though they have very few if any zero modes in their bulk  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the topological origin of these zero modes was explained in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : origandgenlattice ] . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the bulk phonon spectrum of these lattices exhibit lines of topologically protected zero modes , analogous to lines of touching bands in line - node semimetals @xcite and gyroid photonic crystals @xcite , that cause the number of protected surface modes to undergo discontinuous jumps as a function of surface wavenumber .    in 2@xmath0 gkls , </S>",
    "<S> there exist classes of conformations in which all of the bulk vibrational modes , except for the zero - wavevector acoustic modes , have a finite frequency . these fully  gapped \" systems fall into topological classes distinguished by topological invariants characterizing their reciprocal - space band structure . </S>",
    "<S> topological zero - frequency edge modes arise from an interplay between this bulk topological structure and the local mismatch in the number of degrees of freedom and constraints , so that given the bulk topological invariants and the local structure of the surface termination , it is possible to predict the number of zero - frequency modes localized at a surface . in gkls , </S>",
    "<S> the transition between topologically distinct phases is marked by the existence of a line in the brillouin zone along which normal - mode frequencies vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> this line of zero modes is a consequence of the existence of straight lines of bonds , which we call straight filaments , that carry a state of self stress ( sss ) in which the bonds are under tension but site forces vanish . </S>",

    "<S> three - dimensional gpls have a richer structure than two - dimensional gkls . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , like gkls , they exhibit gapless bulk modes associated with localized ssss : arrays of parallel lines of ssss ( straight filaments )  four in the undistorted pyrochlore lattice aligned along the tetrahedral edges  have associated planes of zero modes in reciprocal space aligned perpendicular to the array filaments , and flat planes of self - stress have associated perpendicularly aligned lines of zero modes in reciprocal space . as in the gkl , </S>",

    "<S> there are lines of bulk zero modes in reciprocal space that are protected by an integer topological invariant defined on a path that encircles them . </S>",
    "<S> these are the analog of weyl lines that exist in electronic @xcite and photonic  @xcite systems . </S>",

    "<S> we generalize the pyrochlore lattice by allowing the basis sites to deviate from their original reference positions . in the undeformed pyrochlore lattice , there are 6 sets of straight filaments , built from the bonds on the 6 edges of the tetrahedra , that carry ssss . </S>",

    "<S> any central - force elastic network consisting of periodically repeated unit cells with @xmath34 sites and @xmath35 bonds is governed by the generalized calladine - maxwell theorem  @xcite @xmath36 at each wavevector @xmath37 in the bz . </S>",
    "<S> it relates the number @xmath38 of zero modes , whose displacements do not stretch bonds , and the number @xmath39 of ssss , in which bonds under tension exert no net forces on sites , to the invariant properties @xmath34 and @xmath35 of the unit cell . </S>",
