    "numerous planetary systems have been discovered that consist of two or more planets with masses of a few earth masses ( ) , orbiting in the same plane within @xmath15 of the central star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some properties of such systems are reviewed by @xcite .",
    "a particularly well - studied example is the  system , with a central solar - type star ( age @xmath16 ) and six orbiting planets with semi - major axes ranging from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "their radii , measured through transit observations from the _ kepler _ spacecraft , are @xmath19@xmath20 earth radii ( ) , placing them in the super - earth / sub - neptune size range .",
    "estimates of their masses have been obtained from transit timing measurements ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) ; for the five inner planets , the values range from @xmath21 to @xmath22 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all of these inner planets have densities that are substantially less than that of a rocky planet , implying that they could each be composed of a heavy - element core surrounded by a gaseous envelope . in the cases of planets",
    "c , d , e , and f , these envelopes are most likely composed of hydrogen and helium , in roughly solar proportions , while b s envelope could be composed either of  or  steam ( @xcite  @xcite ; ) .",
    "the estimated mass fractions of these envelopes range from @xmath23% in the case of b to @xmath24% for e .",
    "however , their volumes are substantial and play an important role in determining the observed planet radii .    one of the main issues pertinent to the understanding of this system is the formation history of the planets . while it is generally assumed that these planets formed by core - nucleated accretion @xcite , the formation location is not well established .",
    "several studies have proposed that planets in systems of this type formed in situ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and analytic estimates of the envelope - to - core mass ratio in the relevant mass range have also been made @xcite .",
    "other simulations support the alternative _ ex situ _ assumption , that is , that the planets formed farther out in the disk and , during or after formation , migrated inward to their present positions through interactions with the protoplanetary disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the physical mechanisms involved in the process of orbital migration via disk - planet tidal interactions are reviewed by @xcite and @xcite .    while the in situ model has been favored because the terrestrial planets in the solar system presumably formed in this way , the migration ( or ex situ ) model has been favored because of the difficulties in forming planets in situ in the very inner regions of disks @xcite , well inside the orbit of mercury in the solar system .",
    "however , a significant argument against the ex situ picture is that in a multiple system , if the planets had undergone convergent migration , they would be expected to have been captured into mean - motion resonances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while in fact most of the systems observed by kepler do not appear to be in resonance . @xcite",
    "discuss a mechanism , involving an instability in resonances , that would allow the planets to move through resonances ; therefore , migration is not ruled out .",
    "@xcite revisit this problem and conclude that although the instability in resonances is indeed possible , the time spent by a planet pair in resonance exceeds by a considerable amount the time during which the planets are out of resonance .",
    "thus , they argue that the @xcite process does not solve the problem that most kepler planet pairs are not in resonance . however , there are other mechanisms that could move planets out of resonance , including dissipative effects @xcite , stochastic effects during migration @xcite , tidal effects caused by planet - wake interactions @xcite and the effects of small eccentricities in the planetary orbits @xcite .",
    "moreover , the highly complex orbital architecture of compact multiple systems , as in the case of , may indeed require a migration - based formation scenario @xcite . nevertheless , there are still many other uncertainties in the theory of planet - disk interactions , as discussed in more detail by @xcite and @xcite , leading to legitimate questioning of whether the theoretical processes of planet formation with migration can explain the mass distribution as well as the orbital period distribution of super - earth / sub - neptune planets @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there are several difficulties with the picture of in situ formation of super - earths / sub - neptunes .",
    "first , even if the planets did form by this process , they still would be subject to orbital decay .",
    "if migration is included in simulations of in situ super - earth formation @xcite , the semi - major axis distribution of planets does not agree with the distribution observed by kepler .",
    "agreement is possible only if orbital migration is suppressed .",
    "second , for the specific case of the  system , a very high surface density of solid material in the inner disk is required , well above that of the minimum - mass solar nebula and even above that of minimum - mass extrasolar nebulae @xcite . this problem may be alleviated if it is assumed that solid material migrates inwards from the outer disk , in the form of either protoplanetary cores @xcite , planetesimals @xcite , or small pebbles @xcite , and collects at the appropriate locations .",
    "third , kepler data show an excess of planet pairs just exterior of the 2:1 and 3:2 mean - motion resonances , compared to the pairs just interior to these resonances @xcite , which is not easily accountable by in situ formation .",
    "fourth , it has often been assumed that in the inner disk the temperatures are too high for an appreciable concentration of solid material to exist .",
    "in fact , the simple assumption that the ratio of sound speed to orbital speed , i.e. , the ratio of disk scale height to radial distance , @xmath25 , is @xmath26 at @xmath27 gives a temperature of about @xmath28 for a solar - mass central star . however , this objection is not necessarily significant .",
    "many disk models give cooler temperatures at @xmath29@xmath30 .",
    "the evolving two - dimensional models of @xcite give mid - plane temperatures in the inner disk of about @xmath31 at an age of @xmath32 years , with cooling at later times .",
    "the models of @xcite give even cooler temperatures in the disk interior at these distances .",
    "this paper considers all the observed planets in the system and asks whether they formed in situ or ex situ , i.e. , including orbital migration . in spite of the difficulties mentioned above , both of these possibilities remain viable options .",
    "detailed formation and evolution models are numerically simulated for both scenarios with the same or very similar physical assumptions used in the construction of the planet models . in both cases ,",
    "the simulations are advanced to an age of @xmath33 , where the computed masses , radii , and semi - major axes are compared with observations .",

    "+    the envelope opacity arises from the combined contributions of dust , atoms , and molecules .",

    "is assumed to have an upper bound @xmath36 , the accretion radius , defined by @xmath78 where @xmath38 and @xmath37 are the hill and bondi radius , respectively .",
    "the limiting envelope radii , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , were estimated from first principles by means of three - dimensional ( 3d ) calculations of the flow dynamics around planets in disks @xcite .    at early stages of evolution ,",
    "the planet is `` in contact '' with the disk ( the so - called _ nebular _ stage ) , and the density and temperature at the top of the envelope are taken as the local disk values . during the nebular stage , gas is added to the envelope in order to restore the condition @xmath81 ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "once this condition can no longer be maintained , the envelope contracts inside @xmath36 , entering a _ transition _ stage , which coincides with the run - away gas accretion phase if the gas accretion rate is sufficiently large .",
    "in fact , the gas accretion rate of the envelope , @xmath50 , is limited by the maximum rate at which the disk can deliver gas to the planet s vicinity .",
    "if tidal perturbations by the planet are negligible , the disk - limited accretion rate can be described in terms of simple analytical arguments @xcite . if tidal perturbations are not negligible , the problem becomes highly complex and depends on the interplay among viscous torques , tidal torques , and close - range flow dynamics around the planet .",
    "disk - limited accretion rates were derived from 3d hydrodynamics high - resolution calculations , as described in @xcite , extending the parameter space covered by the fitting functions reported therein to include a larger disk viscosity range .",
    "it is important to stress that @xmath50 can not exceed the disk - limited accretion rate , and there are instances in which this limit sets in during the nebular stage of evolution .",
    "the boundary conditions applied at @xmath41 during the transition stage are discussed in @xcite .    eventually , the disk s gas around the planet s orbit is dispersed , typically via photo - evaporation by stellar radiation , gas supply ceases , and the planet enters the _ isolation _ stage .",
    "note that the process of gap formation in the disk by tidal torques alone , under typical disk conditions of viscosity and temperature and for planetary masses up to several times jupiter s mass ( @xmath82 ) , does not lead to isolation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "during the isolation stage , standard photospheric boundary conditions are applied at @xmath41 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the equilibrium temperature is such that ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the albedo @xmath89 is taken as a constant equal to @xmath29 . in equation  ( [ eq : teq ] ) ,",

    ", a distinction can be made between isolation from the disk s gas and from the disk s solids .",
    "isolation from the planetesimals disk occurs when the migration speed @xmath90 and @xmath91 , or when the solids surface density at the planet s location becomes very small .",
    "isolation from the solid disk occurs prior to isolation from the disk s gas or shortly thereafter .",
    "however , the consequences of this delay are negligible .",
    "thus , when a planet enters the isolation phase , it is basically isolated from both the disk s gas and solids .    during all stages ,",
    "if @xmath92 , mass is gradually removed from the envelope . in a more realistic context , during the nebular and transition stages , an inflated planet would lose unbound mass hydrodynamically , carried away by the surrounding disk flow @xcite .",
    "this mechanism of mass loss is different from those operating during the isolation stage ( see section  [ sec : gl ] ) . as a result of gas loss , while @xmath34 is a monotonic function of time , @xmath49 and @xmath42 may not be .",
    "accretion of solids is treated as in @xcite .",
    "all solids accreted by the planet are assumed to sink to the core , in a condensed form , and increment the core mass . as originally derived by @xcite , the accretion rate of solids can be written as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the effective cross section for planetesimal capture of the planet , @xmath95 is the solids surface density at the planet s orbital radius , @xmath48 , @xmath96 is the planet s orbital frequency , and @xmath53 is the ratio of the gravitational to the geometric cross section @xcite , known as the gravitational enhancement factor .",
    "further details can be found in ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the accretion rate in equation  ( [ eq : dotmc ] ) neglects the contribution of the dust entrained in the accreted gas ( @xmath97% by mass ) .",
    "the planetesimal radius is assumed to be @xmath98 , although smaller planetesimals were also tested .",
    "a planetary embryo accreting planetesimals at a fixed orbital radius will deplete an annular region around its orbit of full width about equal to @xmath99 , at which point the condensed core becomes detached from the planetesimals disk . in these calculations ,",
    "the secular evolution of planetesimals is neglected and therefore , once detached , the core reaches its final mass @xmath100 which neglects the contribution of the envelope mass to @xmath38 and is hence appropriate when @xmath101 .",
    "the situation is more complex for a migrating planet , since the depletion rate of solids in the disk tends to be initially slower than the migration rate through the disk .",
    "hence , the planet cuts a swathe through the solids disk , which deepens as @xmath102 reduces , eventually detaching itself .",
    "the final mass of the core in this case is more difficult to predict , as it depends on both the accretion and migration history . during the long isolation stage , a planet",
    "may be subjected to stochastic impacts , which may alter the core and envelope mass and the planet s orbit if the impactors are sufficiently massive .",
    "this possibility is not considered here .    as mentioned above ,",
    "solids sink to the top of the core .",
    "this process releases energy in the envelope , affecting the local energy budget , but not the local chemical composition of the envelope .",
    "these calculations consider accretion of hydrated , partly hydrated , and anhydrous planetesimals , depending on the local disk temperature .",
    "rocky planetesimals may reach the core nearly intact if they are large enough ( they may be held together by their own gravity ) or if the ram pressure does not exceed their compressive strength ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "ice - rich planetesimals are more easily disrupted or entirely ablated in the envelope because the critical temperature of  is only @xmath103 , a value reached in relatively shallow layers of the envelope ( their mass is nevertheless assumed to sink to the core ) .",
    "an important part of the calculation is represented by the capture of planetesimals , which determines self - consistently the cross section @xmath94 in equation  ( [ eq : dotmc ] ) , and by their interaction with the planet s envelope , which determines depth - dependent mass and energy deposition rates .",
    "this part is based on the protocols described in @xcite , enhanced with an improved integration algorithm of the planetesimals trajectories @xcite . in brief , a number of trajectories with a varying impact parameter ( @xmath104 ) are integrated through the envelope .",
    "the largest impact parameter for which the body hits the core surface , breaks up , or is entirely ablated provides the radius for planetesimal capture and hence the cross section @xmath94 . at this point ,",
    "an additional series of trajectory integrations is performed , with an impact parameter up to the capture radius , to record the ablation history and the fate of the body as a function of the impact parameter .",
    "this collective information provides the mean energy and mass deposition rates in each envelope layer .",
    "the methods outlined above apply to both in situ and ex situ calculations .",
    "the basic difference is that the boundary conditions at @xmath41 change over time in ex situ models , whereas in situ calculations allow only for a linear decline with time of the gas surface density at @xmath41 . in ex situ models ,",
    "the surface density @xmath4 in equation  ( [ eq : dotmc ] ) also varies as a function of the distance from the star and of the disk temperature .",
    "additionally , ex situ models use stellar properties from stellar structure models of solar - type stars to compute the equilibrium temperature ( equation  ( [ eq : teq ] ) ) , the mass - loss rate during isolation ( equation  ( [ eq : mexuv ] ) ) , and the irradiation temperature of the disk ( equation  ( [ eq : tirr ] ) ) .",

    "the results predict a radius within @xmath109% of the earth radius , @xmath110 .",
    "the radius @xmath35 is then used as an inner boundary condition for the  envelope .",
    "ex situ formation calculations allow for accretion of planetesimals whose composition varies as a function of time and distance from the star . at disk temperatures below @xmath111 , the planetesimals are ice - rich , @xmath112% by mass ( @xmath113% silicates and @xmath114% iron ) .",

    "the mass fractions of iron , silicates , and ice are linearly interpolated in temperature between @xmath116 and @xmath115 .    since the composition of the condensed core may vary during the evolution of ex situ models , as the composition of accreted solids changes , detailed calculations of the core structure are performed .",

    "thermal effects ( in -rich cores ) may be relatively important for the determination of @xmath35 during the early stages of the isolation phase ( @xmath637 , see figure  [ fig : rciso ] ) .",
    "however , at an age of @xmath0 , the differences in @xmath35 between thermal and isothermal cores of the simulated  planets are small , typically @xmath638% in most cases and somewhat less than @xmath364% for c. assessing the impact of thermodynamics for the case of b is more difficult , because the expected steam envelope is not modeled .",
