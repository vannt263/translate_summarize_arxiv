    "when the system exhibits a stepwise motion , it should overcome an energy barrier . to reach the top of the barrier the system absorbs some amount of heat from the two heat baths and",

    "[ fig : qrql - shematic ] ) . in equilibrium",
    ", of course , no net heat transfer occurs between the baths on average .",
    "but if we take the ensemble averages of the heat transfer for the individual steps classifying the rightward and the leftward steps , nonvanishing heat transfer between the two baths can survive .",
    "we find that a single rightward step carries heat @xmath61 and a leftward step carries @xmath62 on average . in equilibrium ,",
    "the rightward and the leftward stepwise motions occur with the equal probability and the relation @xmath63 holds , which consistently leads to vanishing of net heat transfer between the two heat baths . in general , nonvanishing values of @xmath53 are obtained @xcite , because it comes from left - right asymmetry of the system .",
    "next , consider the case where a small external force @xmath9 is applied under the iso - thermal condition @xmath64 . from the measurement of @xmath31 and @xmath41",

    "we have observed @xmath68 for sufficiently small @xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : jq - jp](a ) ) .",
    "this implies that the characteristic heat @xmath67 associated with the stepwise motion in the linear region is the characteristic heat @xmath53 at the equilibrium states .",

    "we can rewrite the reciprocity coefficients as @xmath77 using the rate constant @xmath78 for the barrier - overcoming process of the stepwise motion in equilibrium , where @xmath51=@xmath79 .",
    "this form clearly demonstrates that the characteristic heat brought by the barrier - overcoming process results in the reciprocity coefficients .",
    "in this section , we show that the expressions ( [ eqn : reciprocal ] ) of the reciprocity coefficients are valid in a class of feynman s ratchet attached to two heat baths . in this class of systems , we can generally define particle flow @xmath31 and heat flow @xmath41 between the two baths and those temporal quantities @xmath80 and @xmath81 . the reciprocity coefficients are written with the time correlation function in equilibrium states @xcite as @xmath82 where @xmath29 denotes ensemble average .",

    "a system functions as a heat pump if it can absorb energy from a cooler heat bath and dissipate it to a hotter one .",
    "the present system can function as a heat pump when the conditions @xmath101 are valid .",
    "the former inequality means that the heat flow @xmath41 between the two heat baths is against temperature gradient @xmath44 .",
    "the latter means that energy is absorbed from one of the heat bath while dissipated to the other , i.e. , @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 .    for the linear response region with small @xmath9 and @xmath44 , the conditions ( [ eqn : pump ] )",
    "are reduced to @xmath105 which is satisfied in the bright shaded area in @xmath9-@xmath44 plane of fig .",

    "@xmath33 is vanishing in the linear order of @xmath9 and @xmath44 because @xmath106 , which means that the second inequality in ( [ eqn : pump ] ) always holds .    for larger values of @xmath9 and @xmath44 , nonlinear effects ( e.g. nonvanishing @xmath107 ) are not negligible and the region where the system can work as a heat pump is reduced .",
    "for instance , for large values of @xmath9 with @xmath64 , we obtain @xmath38 and @xmath39 as is seen in fig .",

    "adjusting the strength of the applied force within this confined area of parameters , we can choose the energy absorption rate from a cooler heat bath .",
    "the rate is maximum at @xmath108 in the present system ( refer fig .",
    "[ fig : f - deltat ] ) . ) and @xmath109 give a good estimation of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which result in maximum energy absorption rate from a cooler heat bath at @xmath110 . ] the direction of the heat transfer can also be controlled by the direction of the applied force .",
    "the rightward mechanical force induces the absorption of heat from @xmath1 and the dissipation to @xmath0 ( i.e. @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) , and vice versa for the leftward force ( @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) .    with this heat pump",
    ", we can cool an object to the temperature limited by the conditions ( [ eqn : pump ] ) optimizing the applied force .",
    "if we need to achieve lower temperature , we should construct a proper structure combining multiple pumps .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that heat transfer can be controlled by a mechanical force .",
    "we clarified the conditions for the mesoscopic system to function as a heat pump based on the study of the linear response regime and numerical simulations in fully nonequilibrium .",
    "these results are consistent with the results obtained in a discretized solvable model for feynman s ratchet @xcite .",
    "the langevin dynamics adopted in this study suggests an intuitive picture based on the barrier overcoming processes and associated heat transfer @xmath53 .",

    "this estimation can be applied to other models of heat pump , e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the form of the reciprocity coefficient @xmath117 implies that the present heat pump works effectively in small energy scales where barrier - overcoming processes are governed by thermal fluctuations .",
    "this is typically realized in molecular scales .",
    "the pump is not efficient in very low temperatures where the barrier - overcoming event rarely occurs",
