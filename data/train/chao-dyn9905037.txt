    "exact solutions to physical problems are rare . in most cases one has to resort to approximate solutions . in quantum mechanics the wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb )",
    "method , along with perturbation theory , is probably the most common method used to obtain approximate solutions , ( for reviews see  @xcite ) .",
    "the wkb method is a formal @xmath0 expansion for the wave function , that expresses its rapid oscillations in the semiclassical limit . using this expansion combined with an appropriate boundary condition results in an approximate quantization condition .",
    "therefore , high order approximations for the wave function can be used to improve the accuracy of the eigenvalues . a systematic way to obtain approximate quantum eigenvalues using wkb was developed first by dunham  @xcite , was improved by bender and coworkers  @xcite and is summarized in  @xcite . in some cases the resulting series for the eigenvalues converge to the exact ones , but generally the resulting expansion will be an asymptotic series .",
    "a surprisingly small number of papers were devoted to the accuracy of semiclassical methods , and even less for high orders or high dimensional systems .",
    "a naive estimate for the accuracy of semiclassical methods is that the leading semiclassical approximation is accurate to order @xmath0 and therefore the resulting error is of order @xmath1 .",
    "for example , substitution of the van vleck propagator into schrdingers equation will not solve the equation exactly , and a reminder of order @xmath1 will result  @xcite . the mean level spacing scales like @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the dimension of the system , thus the relative error scales like @xmath4 and the semiclassical method fails for high dimensional systems .",
    "the prefactor of the semiclassical error is important ( in particular for @xmath5 ) , since individual energies can be found semiclassically only if the error is less than the mean level spacing",
    ". for integrable systems the wkb expansion enables one to find analytic estimates for the error in the energies and this will be demonstrated for a class of such systems in this paper .",
    "in addition it may shed light also on the accuracy of the semiclassical approximation for other dynamical systems . the common argument for the failure of the semiclassical approximation for chaotic systems in @xmath6 and possibly for @xmath5 was recently challenged by primack and smilansky  @xcite . for chaotic systems energy",
    "is the only quantum number and this is the only identity of a level .",
    "the mean level spacing is determined by the smooth weyl term .",
    "this term can be determined for billiards to a high order in plancks constant @xmath0 .",
    "primack and smilansky introduced a method to evaluate the error in the energy levels resulting from the fact that oscillatory terms are known only to the leading order in @xmath0 .",
    "they concluded that the error in the evaluation of single levels compared to the mean level spacing diverges at most as @xmath7 in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "dahlqvist  @xcite estimated effects of diffraction for the @xmath5 sinai billiard and concluded that ignoring diffraction , as is done in the standard semiclassical approximation , may result in errors at least of the order of the mean level spacing .    here we will study the much simpler case of integrable systems when an expression for the energy levels can be obtained to arbitrary order in @xmath0 and the levels that are poorly approximated in the leading order of the semiclassical approximation can be characterized .",
    "an estimate for the error of the semiclassical quantization for the hyperspherical billiard , that is a generalization of the circle billiard , will be obtained .",
    "this billiard has been subjected to several works regarding the semiclassical accuracy .",
    "prosen and robnik explored the error for the energies of the circle billiard numerically  @xcite .",
    "they found that the mean error increases with the energy , and concluded that the semiclassical approximation fails in this simple system .",
    "boasman used the boundary integral method to find the quantization error for several billiards , including the circle billiard  @xcite .",
    "the error was found to be a small fraction of the mean level spacing for general two dimensional billiards . for the circle billiard he found that for most of the energies the semiclassical error is a constant , which is a small fraction of the mean level spacing . there were large errors for some eigenenergies ,",
    "the corresponding eigenfunctions were found to be affected by caustics , and it was stated that the fraction of these poorly approximated states decreases with energy .",
    "following earlier work of agam  @xcite we use a certain wkb expansion , keeping the classical quantities fixed , that gives identical quantization condition to the one obtained from the debye expansion of the bessel function .",
    "this expansion enables us to estimate the fraction of states where the error in the leading semiclassical approximation exceeds some value .",
    "the relation to caustics turns out transparent . for integrable systems",
    "this is a better measure then the mean error since some eigenenergies , that can be clearly characterized , may have extremely large errors .",
    "the reason is that for integrable systems , contrary to chaotic ones , there are other quantum numbers in addition to the energy .",
    "these help to characterize the groups of quantum eigenstates that are badly approximated in the leading order of the semiclassical approximation .",
    "the semiclassical expansion for the eigenvalues of the hyperspherical billiard to second order in @xmath0 is derived in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] , with the help of the standard semiclassical expansion , as well as the debye expansion of the bessel functions . in sec .",
    "[ section3 ] the density of eigenvalues where the semiclassical approximation is poor ( a term that is defined in that section ) is derived analytically and tested numerically .",
    "the results are summarized in sec .",
    "[ section4 ] and the implications for other systems are discussed .",
    "in this section the semiclassical quantization for the hyperspherical billiard will be developed up to second order in @xmath0 .",
    "first a short introduction to a systematic wkb expansion for one dimensional problems will be given .",
    "then the debye expansion for the bessel function will be used to derive the second order quantization condition .",
    "this derivation is much simpler than the derivation that uses a systematic wkb expansion . in order to verify that the quantization condition derived from the debye expansion of the bessel function is indeed a result of a semiclassical expansion a wkb series will be developed for the radial wave function .",
    "quantization of this series indeed gives the same quantization condition that was obtained using the debye series ( at least up to second order ) .",
    "a scheme for quantization using high order wkb expansion is known , at least for an ordinary differential equation such as the equations found for separable hamiltonians  @xcite .",

    "each turning point gives a simple zero of @xmath17 , and the contour integral for @xmath18 counts these zeros and results in the maslov index .",
    "all of the other odd terms are real , and usually without cuts in the complex @xmath19 plane .",
    "thus these terms will not contribute to the quantization condition  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the quantization condition becomes @xmath20 where m is the maslov index to be evaluated later ( for the simple problem with two turning points , @xmath21 is just @xmath22 , the number of zeros of @xmath17 ) .",
    "the fact that only even terms contribute to the quantization makes this quantization method efficient since the correction to the eigenvalues will be smaller by @xmath1 instead of @xmath0 .",
    "this will motivate us transform the radial differential equation to a form without a first derivative .",
    "the specific problem that will be studied in this work is the d dimensional hyperspherical billiard , namely a free particle inside a d dimensional ball ( @xmath23 ) with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "generalized spherical coordinates will be most convenient to solve the schrdinger equation .",
    "the d dimensional hamiltonian reduces to the laplacian operator @xmath24 with the boundary condition @xmath25 on the wave functions .",
    "the generalized angular momentum operator is @xmath26 and its eigenvalues are @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the radial and angular variables can be separated as @xmath28 . for the hyperspherical billiard",
    "the radial schrdinger equation is @xmath29    the exact solution can be easily obtained using the fact that the radial equation  ( [ radialeq ] ) can be reduced to the bessel equation of order @xmath30 , namely @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the solutions are @xmath35 , the bessel functions of the first kind of order @xmath30 , and the quantization condition is : @xmath36 this result is exact .",
    "the dimensionless variables @xmath37 will be introduced for simplicity .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath38 .    in order to make contact with the semiclassical expansion it is useful to introduce a large order expansion of the bessel function since for small @xmath0",

    "semiclassical quantization , using the debye expansion , is performed in orders of @xmath0 , by requiring that the wave function will have a zero at @xmath45 , order by order in @xmath46 .",
    "thus to the second order the quantization condition is : @xmath47    first we solve for the first order condition and correct it perturbatively . define @xmath48 as the leading order solution .",
    "it satisfies @xmath49 the second order solution can be expanded around the first order one : @xmath50 .",
    "the term @xmath51 is of the order @xmath46 and therefore small . substituting in  ( [ debye2 ] )",
    "one finds @xmath52 this last expression can be given in terms of the first order solutions @xmath53 or the second order ones since the difference is of higher order in @xmath46 .",
    "the last step is to rewrite the first order condition as @xmath54 .",
    "this results in @xmath55 this is the second order semiclassical quantization condition .",
    "for every pair of quantum numbers @xmath56 one can solve for @xmath57 and obtain @xmath58 .",
    "since the quantization condition is determined by only two quantum numbers , the problem behaves like a system of two degrees of freedom , if one chooses to ignore degeneracies .",
    "the reason for denoting this quantization condition as a second order one will become clear shortly .",
    "we turn now to apply the systematic semiclassical expansion to  ( [ radialeq ] ) .",
    "our goal is to show that the quantization condition that was obtained from asymptotic expansion of bessel functions coincides with the one obtained from a wkb expansion .",
    "this equation has a first order derivative and therefore does not have the form of the one dimensional schrdinger equation  ( [ oned ] ) . to exploit",
    "the formal wkb expansion described above one has to eliminate the first order derivative from the equation .",
    "substitution of @xmath59 in  ( [ radialeq ] ) leads to the following equation for @xmath60 @xmath61 \\phi ( r ) = e \\phi ( r ) .",
    "\\label{nofirsteq}\\ ] ]    thus after this substitution the resulting equation will be similar to that of a system with one degree of freedom and the wkb method will give better results .",
    "the angular momentum that appears in this equation is the semiclassical one ( see  ( [ nodimen ] ) and app .  [ appa ] ) , as opposed to the exact angular momentum @xmath62 as will be explained in what follows .",
    "these differ by an extra term that vanishes in the limit @xmath63 .",
    "that gives one some freedom in defining the semiclassical variables .",
    "thus , for example , we can define the limit as @xmath63 while @xmath64 and @xmath65 are constants .",
    "this prescription for the semiclassical limit is problematic , since the form of the resulting leading order wave function near zero and at infinity differs than from the one of the exact wave function .",
    "this problem is known for the spherical case ( @xmath66 ) , where the exact angular momentum is replaced by the semiclassical one , a modification introduced by langer  @xcite . for the @xmath3 dimensional generalized angular momentum",
    "the analog is the replacement of @xmath67 by @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , we define the semiclassical limit as the limit where @xmath8 while @xmath64 and @xmath69 are constant .",
    "the difference between these definitions of the angular momentum vanishes in the limit @xmath8 . as a result",
    ", we will apply the wkb approximation to the following equation @xmath70 using the expansion  ( [ expansion ] ) for the wave function we find that the recursion relation  ( [ recursion ] ) changes to @xmath71    the first order contribution to the quantization is obtained from the @xmath72 order of  ( [ newrecursion ] ) @xmath73 .",

    "( [ nodimen ] ) ) is the ratio between the radius of the billiard and the minimal distance of the classical orbit from the origin , or the radius of the caustic .",
    "therefore , if z is close to @xmath74 then the state is more affected by caustics and the semiclassical approximation deteriorates .",
    "the reason is that the wave function of these states is close both to the caustic and to the hard wall where the pure semiclassical approximation fails .",

    "the hyperspherical billiard exhibits a high degree of symmetry .",
    "therefore there are only two quantum numbers , @xmath110 , that determine the quantization condition . as a result ,",
    "if levels are not weighted by their degeneracies the density of the degenerate energy levels is quasi two dimensional .",
    "consequently , if the number of states that are affected by caustics is small than one can use wkb to determine single energy levels .",

    ", the spectrum can be constructed by adding the contributions from different angular momenta .",
    "it is important to understand that when we sum over @xmath30 the energy is kept fixed , thus we actually sum over the different quantum states @xmath114 with energy near @xmath64 .",
    "if the sum is over all the possible values of @xmath30 then one is counting all the possible states and will get the total density of states . if one wants to sum only the states that are badly approximated one should sum only the states that satisfy the condition @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is a measure for the maximally allowed error . from  ( [ eq : diffe ] ) it is clear that @xmath117 is monotonically decreasing with @xmath57 . to find the density of badly approximated states one sums only values of @xmath30 satisfying this inequality . replacing the restricted sum @xmath118 by an integral and changing variables to @xmath119 , leads to    @xmath120    the resulting density of badly approximated states is @xmath121 .",

    "the density of badly approximated states does not change with the energy ! !",
    "thus , the probability that a state is badly approximated by the wkb method does not depend upon the energy of the state .",
    "it is important to notice that this expression is useful only in the limit @xmath122 . when @xmath123 the connection between the allowed error and @xmath116 is not accurate since the various terms in the debye series are of comparable magnitude and the expansion can not be terminated",
    "indeed , when all of the states are included , ( for @xmath124 any state is considered to be badly approximated ) , the density of all the states is @xmath125 , as expected since this is the total density of states according to the weyl formula in two dimensions ( the double degeneracy of states with positive and negative angular momentum quantum numbers is ignored here ) .    to verify these results we computed the first 125336 exact and semiclassical levels in the d=4 dimensional hyperspherical billiard numerically .",
    "a convenient set of units is @xmath126 .",
    "the error in each eigenvalue was computed directly from comparison between the exact energy levels computed from  ( [ exactquan ] ) and their semiclassical approximation computed from  ( [ sem ] ) .",
    "a set of @xmath116 values was chosen .",
    "each value of @xmath116 defines a semiclassical error by  ( [ eq : diffe ] ) , with @xmath127 .",
    "then , the density of states with error larger than this semiclassical error was computed by counting the number of such states in an energy interval which is much larger than the mean level spacing but small enough not to smear any possible energy dependence .",
    "this number is just the density of badly approximated states times the width of the energy interval . for each @xmath116 the density of badly approximated states",
    "was found to be constant when the energy was changed , as expected from  ( [ baden ] ) .",
    "the value of this density was compared to the density predicted by  ( [ baden ] ) , and is presented in  fig .",
    "[ fig : figu1 ] .",
    "the approximation  ( [ baden ] ) was found to be excellent .",
    "4.in 3.5 in    it was found that using the fact that the system is integrable and the knowledge of its degeneracy , we can treat the spectrum of the hyperspherical billiard as two dimensional .",
    "the density of badly approximated states was calculated and was found to be energy independent contrary to a previous statements  @xcite . only in the limit where the angular momentum is negligible there are no large errors in quantization , since the system is effectively one dimensional .",
    "the accuracy of the semiclassical approximation was studied for the hyperspherical billiard .",
    "the approximation was found to fail for energies corresponding to states that are localized on such tori , that the caustic is close to the wall . as the caustic approaches the wall the region in space where the semiclassical approximation for the wave function is justified shrinks , and the quality of this approximation deteriorates .",
    "the semiclassical approximation for eigenvalues can be arbitrary bad ( for @xmath128 , in our case ) .",
    "for this reason the average semiclassical error is meaningless since it may be dominated by few large contributions .",
    "it is much more reasonable to calculate the fraction of badly approximated states , namely the fraction of states where the semiclassical error exceeds some value .",
    "the density of such states was found to depend only on one parameter that measures the ratio between the angular momentum and its maximal possible classical value for a given energy ( the parameter was denoted by @xmath116 , and the regime where the semiclassical approximation fails is @xmath129 ) .",
    "the semiclassical error  ( [ eq : diffe ] ) depends only on @xmath57 and not on the energy .",
    "therefore we concluded that the density of poorly approximated eigenvalues characterized by @xmath116 is independent of energy .",
    "the semiclassical approximation does _ not _ improve as the energy increases , contrary to common belief ( stated for example in  @xcite ) .",
    "lazutkin found that convex billiards have tori of the kam type along the boundary .",
    "he also proved that it is possible to use a wkb like method to obtain approximate solutions and energy levels on these tori  @xcite .",
    "for these states there is a caustic near a hard wall and we expect that the energy levels will be badly approximated .    for integrable systems",
    "there are symmetries and the situation where degeneracies exist is quite typical . since the symmetries are respected by the semiclassical approximation also the degeneracies are preserved and the levels of the semiclassical approximation have the same degeneracy as the exact ones .",
    "therefore it is meaningless to compare the semiclassical error to the mean level spacing that is inversely proportional to the total number of energy levels .",
    "it is much more meaningful to consider the error within each group characterized by some symmetry and therefore by an additional quantum number .",
    "since the existence of quantum numbers in addition to energy and of caustics are generic for integrable systems we expect some of the results found in this work to be generic for such systems .",
    "it is expected that the semiclassical approximation will fail for well defined groups of states and the fraction of such states , rather than the mean semiclassical error is a good measure of the quality of the semiclassical approximation . to our understanding in general the density of badly approximated states may depend on energy , contrary to the situation in the present work",
    ". the characterization of this dependence should be the subject of further studies .",
    "the results of this work may be relevant for mixed systems , for quantum states that are localized in the regular regions .",
    "for chaotic systems and for the chaotic component of mixed systems , there are no caustics and the wave functions usually spreads over all the chaotic region .",
    "the energy is the only identity of an eigenstate",
    ". therefore the results of this work may not be of direct relevance for such systems and the mechanism for the destruction of the semiclassical approximation is different there .",
    "some corrections to the trace formula for chaotic systems may be of a similar origin .",
    "alonso and gaspard computed the correction to the gutzwiller trace formulae for billiards  @xcite .",
    "the correction is complicated but some of its parts have geometrical meaning .",
    "one term is proportional to the sum @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the chord length .",
    "another contribution is proportional to @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the radius of curvature of the wall and @xmath134 is the angle between the orbit and the normal to the wall at the incident point . when a caustic is close to a hard wall the typical chord length will be small and also @xmath135 .",
    "thus the correction to the leading order contribution of periodic orbits will diverge and the semiclassical quantization may fail . therefore we expect that semiclassical methods will give poor results for contributions of orbits that are adjacent to a hard wall . for chaotic systems , because of ergodicity a typical orbit will not have a large fraction of chords near the wall of a billiard therefore this correction will not be dominate .",
    "one can expect that in such systems the semiclassical error will fluctuate around some average without extreme deviations .",
    "as is clear from the present work the situation will be different for integrable and mixed systems .",
