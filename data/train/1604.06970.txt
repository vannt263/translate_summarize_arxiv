    "human activity recognition comprises a range of open challenges and is a very active research area @xcite , spanning topics from visual recognition of individual behavior @xcite , pairwise interactions among individuals participating in different roles in a joint activity @xcite , coordinated sequences of actions as expressions of planned activity @xcite , and multiple groups of individuals interacting across broad time scales . in this paper",
    ", we address the last of these , presenting a framework for automatically constructing an interpretation of high - level human activity structure as observed in surveillance video , across multiple , interleaved instances of activities .",
    "we assume that lower - level visual processing provides high quality tracks of individuals moving through the scene .",
    "our goal is to construct accurate descriptions of the events in the video at different levels of granularity , based on the tracks alone .",
    "we develop a probabilistic generative model that combines multiple features that to our knowledge have not been previously incorporated into a single framework for joint inference . to wit : ( 1 ) activities have _ composite structure _ with _ roles _ representing semantically distinct aspects of the overall activity structure .",
    "( 2 ) activities are described _ hierarchically _ and _ recursively _ , entailing _ multiple levels of granularity _ both in time and membership .",
    "( 3 ) arbitrarily sized groups of actors participate in activities and fulfill roles .",
    "( 4 ) hierarchical descriptions and temporally changing groupings consist of the _ best joint explanation _ of the full set of individual trajectories , as found via posterior probabilistic inference .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section , we review prior research , with a focus on work modeling group membership , hierarchically structured activities , and the identification of roles . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we present our probabilistic generative model . in section",
    "[ sec : inference ] we present an mcmc sampling framework for performing joint inference using the model . in section  [ sec : experiments ] we evaluate the model on synthetic and real - world data from the virat @xcite and ucla aerial event @xcite video data sets , demonstrating the model s expressive power and effectiveness .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of future work .",
    "a number of researchers have proposed models that distinguish the different roles that individuals play in a coordinated activity @xcite .",
    "these models capture the semantics of activities with component structure",
    ". it can be difficult to scale role identification in scenes with an arbitrary number of individuals , in particular while properly handling identification of non - participants @xcite .",
    "a consequence of our joint inference over role assignments and groups is that our model naturally distinguishes and separates participants of different activities playing different roles .",
    "considerable work has been devoted to developing more expressive models in which activities are decomposed into hierarchical levels of description , across different spatial and temporal granularities .",
    "some prior models account for a specific number of hierarchical levels of description , with up to 3 levels being a popular choice @xcite .",
    "other models permit a potentially greater number of levels of activity description , but the activity hierarchy is fixed prior to inference @xcite . in only a few cases , including our model , are the levels of activity description assessed during inference @xcite .",
    "a third branch of work has been devoted to modeling activities not just among individuals , but involving groups of actors . in some models ,",
    "activities include groups , but interactions are still considered between individuals within groups @xcite .",
    "other models allow for activities to be performed between groups themselves @xcite .",
    "still others , including our model , take group activity modeling a step further , allowing for arbitrary numbers of participants in groups , provided they satisfy group membership criteria while performing the activity @xcite .    two recent papers , one by @xcite and one by @xcite , come closest to accommodating the combination of features in our model .",
    "both have developed methods for simultaneous inference of group structure with roles in hierarchically structured activities .",
    "one key difference between the two is that the former , like our model , can flexibly accommodate multiple levels of activity description in the course of inference , while the latter is restricted to two fixed levels of description during inference ( one for group activities , and the other for their member roles ) .",
    "a crucial difference with our approach is that we consider the possibility of detecting multiple occurrences of the same type of activity description in a scene , and these descriptions are integrated into a single probabilistic joint model in order to influence inference of the overall activity structure .",
    "while activities described in @xcite have hierarchical component structure with roles , their model does not accommodate more than one top level activity ( i.e. assault , meet , robbery , etc . ) occurring during the course of the video , nor changes in group membership by individuals over such high - level activities .",
    "we present a probabilistic generative model describing how coordinated activities by groups of individuals give rise to the observed physical trajectories of the actors involved . in section [ sec : terms ] we introduce some terminology .",
    "then , in section [ sec : representation ] we give precise definitions of the representations employed by our model for activities , groups , activity sequences , and spatial trajectories .",
    "next , in section [ sec : topology ] , we define the factors in the joint probability distribution that comprise the generative model .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : specific - activities ] we define the specific activities that are used to model the scenes that we use for evaluation in section [ sec : experiments ] .",
    "_ activities _ are optionally composed of other activities .",
    "for example , the canonical meet activity in our model consists of multiple participating groups , each of which must move - to the location of the meeting , unless they are already there , and then possibly wait ( stand ) until one or more other groups arrive .",
    "engaging in a move - to activity requires the group to carry out a sequence of walk and run activities .",
    "the semantics of a walk or run is , in turn , characterized by the group s physical trajectory in space .",
    "a scene is described as an _ activity tree _ , which has a recursive structure , much as a syntactic tree describes the recursive phrase structure of a natural language sentence , but with an added temporal component .",
    "an example of such a tree is depicted in figure  [ fig : ex - tree ] .",
    "we refer to the more abstract , `` nonterminal '' activities that are defined in terms of other activities as _ intentional _ , and the `` leaf '' activities that are defined in terms of observable movement as _",
    "_ participants _ in an intentional activity are divided into _ subgroups _",
    ", each of which plays a particular _ role _ with respect to the parent activity .",
    "carrying out a particular role entails engaging in a sequence of subactivities , each of which may be physical or intentional . in intentional activities",
    ", the group may be decomposed further into smaller subgroups , each with their own role in the subactivity , and so on .",
    "the _ sequence _ of subactivities performed by participants in a role is constrained ( either deterministically or stochastically ) according to the dynamics associated with the role . in cases where a role in a parent activity may be realized as a sequence that includes the same activity type as the parent , the structure is recursive , and allows for arbitrary nesting of activities at different time scales .",
    "for example , in figure [ fig : example ] , a group of individuals participating in a meet activity performs a sub - meet of their own .",
    "physical activities are associated with _ group trajectories _ , which are coupled either via shared membership or when an intentional activity requires their coordination .",
    "an individual , @xmath0 , has an observed trajectory that is generated as a sequence of connected sub - trajectories , one for each physical activity in which @xmath0 participates , and which is constrained to be near the respective group trajectory .",
    "an example of an observed set of individual trajectories is shown in figure [ fig : ex - trajs-3 ] .",
    "an important feature of our model is that group trajectories are not explicitly represented during inference .",
    "the assertion that there is some group trajectory induces correlations among the individual trajectories of the members , but we average over all possible group trajectories ( marginalizing them out ) when computing the posterior probability of a description .",
    "this allows activity descriptions with different numbers of groups to be compared based on the posterior probabilities of their activity trees alone , without needing to deal with probability densities with different numbers of dimensions .",
    "formally , an activity is a tuple @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is an activity label ( e.g. , walk ) , and @xmath3 are the start and end time of the activity , respectively .",
    "the simplest activities are _ physical _ activities , e.g. , walking , running and standing , which directly constrain the motion of a group of individuals over an interval of time . for example",
    ", a run activity is expected to yield trajectories with speeds corresponding to typical human running .",
    "we denote the set of physical activity labels by @xmath4 . similarly , _",
    "intentional _ activities include meet and move - to .",
    "we denote the set of intentional activity labels by @xmath5 .",
    "the complete set of activities is denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "the set of participants in activity @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "we let @xmath9 , the size of the group .",
    "this set is partitioned into subgroups , @xmath10 , where the number @xmath11 of subgroups is bounded only by the number of individuals , @xmath12 , in the group . when specifying the probability model , it is convenient to work instead with the indicator variables , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 indicates which of the @xmath11 subgroups participant @xmath0 is affiliated with . note that @xmath15 contains exactly the same information as the partition . in the following description ,",
    "we omit the subscript @xmath7 for readability .",
    "each subgroup within activity @xmath7 performs a _ sequence _ of subactivities . for example",
    ", a subgroup in a meet might perform a sequence of two subactivities : first , move - to a designated meeting location , and then stand in that location while meeting with other subgroups , who may have also approached that location .",
    "alternatively , one of the subgroups could be involved in a side meeting , with further subgroups that approach and merge with each other before their union merges with another subgroup of the top - level meet .",
    "figure  [ fig : example ] provides such an example .",
    "the sequences of subactivities performed by subgroups are governed by _",
    "roles_. each subgroup @xmath16 is assigned a role from a set @xmath17 defined by the parent activity @xmath2 .",
    "roles govern the dynamics of the sequence of subactivities that each group carries out , via a set of parameters associated with that role .",
    "the parameters for role @xmath18 specify what the allowable activities are in the activity sequence of a group carrying out that role , as well as hard or soft constraints involving what order the activities occur in .",
    "the subgroup of the example meet activity above would be assigned the role of approacher , which prescribes a move - to followed by a stand . in this case the constraint on the order of subactivities is deterministic , with the only degrees of freedom being the times at which transitions take place .",
    "these constraints can be represented by a markov chain with a degenerate initial distribution and a transition matrix with only one non - zero off - diagonal entry per column .",
    "more general initial and transition distributions will give rise to softer constraints on activity sequences .      ultimately , each physical activity , realized over the interval @xmath19 $ ] , is associated with a _ group trajectory _ , denoted by @xmath20 , which is a 2 by @xmath21 array specifying a 2-dimensional position on the ground plane for each time index between @xmath22 and @xmath23 inclusive .",
    "the group trajectory represents the central tendency of the members individual trajectory segments during the interval @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "since individual @xmath0 s path depends on the sequence of activities it participates in , each individual trajectory @xmath24 consists of segments , @xmath25 , consecutive pairs of which must be connected at _ transition points _ , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes the start of segment @xmath28 and the end of segment @xmath29 .",
    "we now describe the generative process for activities .",
    "the high - level process has three steps : ( 1 ) recursive expansion of intentional activities , ( 2 ) generation of group trajectories for the set of physical activities , and ( 3 ) generation of individual trajectories conditioned on the group assignments and group trajectories .",
    "in the first step of activity generation , each intentional activity gives rise to one or more child activity sequences : one for each subgroup of participants involved in the parent activity .",
    "each child sequence is assigned a role , based on the parent activity type .",
    "subgroups and role assignments occur jointly .",
    "the choice of role governs the sequence of activities that the subgroup engages in , by specifying a markov transition function .",
    "each segment of an activity sequence may be a physical activity or another intentional activity .",
    "each intentional activity in the sequence is recursively expanded until only physical activities are generated . as a working example for this stage of the process",
    ", we consider the meet activity at node 1 , at the root of the tree in figure  [ fig : ex - tree ] .",
    "node 1 has two child sequences corresponding to the two subgroups involved in the meeting , both carrying out the approacher role .",
    "one of those child sequences consists of just a single move - to activity , while the other consists of two activities : a meet , followed by a move - to . in general , a special top - level root activity , a `` free - for - all '' ( ffa ) , comprises all actors and has a duration over the entire video .",
    "all other activities are children of the root ffa .",
    "( to simplify the example tree in figure  [ fig : ex - tree ] , we removed the parent ffa . ) the details of this tree expansion are given in `` '' , below .",
    "we make a conditional independence assumption by supposing that the contents of a parent activity fully specify the distribution of possible child sequences , and that child sequences are conditionally independent of each other given their parent .",
    "since child sequences can contain other intentional activities , activity generation is a recursive process , which bottoms out when no intentional activities are generated .    in the second step of the generative process",
    ", group trajectories are generated for each physical activity .",
    "this process must satisfy two constraints : ( a ) physical activity trajectories that share members and that border in time must be spatially connected ; and ( b ) groups that need to physically interact as co - participants in an intentional activity , such as a meet , must have trajectories that intersect at the appropriate points in time . due to these constraints",
    "it is not feasible to generate group trajectories conditionally independently given the activity tree .",
    "instead they are generated jointly according to a global gaussian process with a covariance kernel that depends on the activity tree in such a way as to enforce the key constraints .",
    "the details of this process are given in `` '' , below .",
    "for the example tree in figure  [ fig : ex - tree ] , four group trajectory segments are needed , one for each physical activity leaf node . since walk activity 9 is part of a meeting in which its participants must meet with the participants in walk activity 7 , the group trajectories for 7 and 9 must end in the same location . similarly , walk 4 must end where stand 5 is located .    in the final step of the generative process",
    ", the individual trajectories are realized , conditioned on the set of group trajectories . here , conditional independence is possible , with each individual s trajectory depending only on the sequence of group trajectories for physical activities in which that individual is a participant .",
    "this process is detailed in section `` '' .",
    "let @xmath30 be a parent intentional activity , where @xmath31 indexes the set of activities .",
    "its participant set @xmath32 ( by relabeling , we assume that @xmath33 ) is divided into subgroups , where the @xmath0th participant of @xmath34 is assigned to group @xmath35 , and the distinct realized groups are numbered @xmath36 through @xmath37 .",

    "subgroup @xmath16 is assigned role @xmath41 , and we define @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath16th subgroup , which has participants @xmath43 and role @xmath44 , produces an activity sequence according to the stochastic process associated with @xmath44 , which has parameters @xmath45 , a markov transition function , and @xmath46 , an initial activity distribution .",
    "denote the resulting sequence by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the number of jumps generated by the process , and the @xmath49 are activity tuples , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 .",
    "figure [ fig : activity ] illustrates the graphical model of this production .     of participants of activity",
    "@xmath34 is partitioned into groups @xmath52 via the indicator vector @xmath53 .",
    "each group is assigned a role , @xmath44 , and performs an activity sequence @xmath54 , @xmath55 . ]    to summarize , the grouping , role assignment , and child activity sequences within activity @xmath34 are generated according to @xmath56 , which factors as @xmath57 where we define @xmath58 .",
    "we assume that roles are assigned independently , so that @xmath59",
    ". additionally , we model the partition of @xmath32 into subgroups using a chinese restaurant process ( @xmath60 ) , whose concentration parameter @xmath61 depends on the activity label .",
    "that is , we let @xmath62 be the @xmath60 mass function with parameter @xmath61 .",
    "each segment @xmath63 of @xmath64 that is an intentional activity is expanded and its members are subdivided recursively according to , replacing @xmath34 with @xmath63 and @xmath32 with @xmath43 . once all expansions contain exclusively physical activities , the recursion has bottomed out .",
    "the resulting tree consists of all intentional activities @xmath65 , all physical activities , @xmath66 , and , for each intentional activity @xmath67 , its membership partition @xmath53 , role assignments @xmath68 , and subgroup activity sequences @xmath69 .",
    "we denote this complete tree by @xmath70 , whose prior distribution is @xmath71      the leaves of the activity tree are all physical activities , each of which is associated with a group trajectory . in general , the endpoints of different group trajectories are _ not _ independent ( given @xmath70 ) , since they may be constrained to start or end at the same location .",
    "consequently , we define a joint distribution on all of the group trajectory endpoints , and , conditioned on their endpoints , we treat their interiors as independent .    we model the interiors as realizations of gaussian",
    "processes @xcite with the squared - exponential kernel function .",
    "this results in trajectories that are generally smooth , but flexible enough to allow for different kinds of motion .",
    "we use different scale parameters @xmath72 depending on the activity @xmath73 , which determines the rate of change of the trajectory .",
    "we specify dependencies among the set of trajectory endpoints by first defining an undirected weighted graph @xmath74 over the endpoints .",
    "we use this graph to construct a constraint matrix over transition points by interpreting the sum of the weights on the shortest path between two nodes as distances .",
    "we then apply a positive semidefinite isotropic covariance kernel point - wise to the distance matrix to transform the distances into covariances .",

    "abusing notation slightly , we will write @xmath76 and @xmath77 for both the endpoints of a group trajectory and the corresponding node in @xmath74 .",
    "we introduce three kinds of edges on @xmath74 : temporal , transitional , and compositional .",
    "two nodes are connected by a _",
    "temporal _ edge when they belong to the same physical activity .",
    "the start of an activity , @xmath76 , is connected to the end of another activity , @xmath78 , by a _ transitional _",
    "edge when they correspond to the same moment in time and the corresponding activities share at least one participant .",
    "finally , two endpoints are connected by a _",
    "edge if they correspond to the same moment in time and have a common ancestor that specifies they must coincide , e.g. , in a meet activity , all participants must _ end _ in the same location .",
    "all transitional and compositional edges have weight ( or `` distance '' ) zero , corresponding to the constraint that the connected edges must correspond to the same trajectory position .",
    "the weight assigned to temporal edges is a function of the time elapsed during the intervening physical activity and the @xmath79 associated with the activity label ( e.g. , `` slower - moving '' activities having lower weights , corresponding to a stronger dependence between the positions of their endpoints ) .",

    "we first define performance counts in terms of an individual at a frame , then compute overall counts and associated performance measures .    for an individual @xmath0 at frame @xmath28 ,",
    "let @xmath152 be the set of individuals which have the same label as @xmath0 in @xmath70 .",
    "define @xmath153 similarly for @xmath150 .",
    "the set of false positives for @xmath0 is @xmath154 , the set of false negatives is @xmath155 , the true positives are @xmath156 , and the true negatives are @xmath157 , where @xmath158 is the set of all individuals .",
    "we follow a similar approach when evaluating grouping performance . for person @xmath0",
    ", we compare the groups to which @xmath0 belongs in @xmath150 and @xmath70 at each frame @xmath159 .",
    "since the two trees could have different depths and topologies , it is not necessarily clear which groups should be compared with which ; however , every individual is part of exactly one physical activity group at each frame , as well as one highest level node .",
    "consequently , we only compare groups at these two levels of the tree , without penalty for difference in activities within a level .",
    "thus once we determine the group associated with person @xmath0 at frame @xmath159 at the physical ( resp .",
    "highest ) activity level of each tree , we compute the score as before .      the performance of our algorithm is summarized in tables [ tab : act - label ] and [ tab : group - performance ] .",
    "table [ tab : act - label ] shows the activity labeling precision and recall on the two synthetic scenes ( synth1 and synth2 ) , a video sequence obtained from the virat dataset , and four different video sequences from the ucla aerial event dataset ( uaed ) . in table",
    "[ tab : group - performance ] we see the performance as measured by our grouping evaluation metric described above .    .activity labeling results for synthetic videos synth1 and synth2 , and the virat and ucla aerial event datasets .",
    "each table shows precision , recall , and f1 for each activity .",
    "see section [ sec : evaluation ] for details . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we extracted four video sequences from the ucla aerial event dataset ( uaed ) .",
    "more specifically , we searched for subsequences of videos which featured properties like activity nesting , groups interchanging members , etc .",
    "the result is four video sequences of roughly @xmath160 frames each .",
    "as we can see in table [ tab : act - label ] , which shows the overall precision and recall scores , for all four videos , our algorithm performs reasonably well across all activities .",
    "note the relatively low recall score of the meet activity , which is due in large part to one very long missed meet in the third video sequence .",
    "similarly , table [ tab : group - performance ] shows that our algorithm performs well at finding groups of individuals at both the physical and intentional activity levels .",
    "we have presented a probabilistic generative model of complex multi - agent activities over arbitrary time scales .",
    "the activities specify component roles between groups of actors and accommodate unboundedly deep recursive , hierarchical structure .",
    "the model accommodates arbitrary groups participating in activity roles , describing both between - group and between - individual interactions .",
    "physical and intentional ( higher - level description ) activities explain hierarchical correlations among individual trajectories . to our knowledge ,",
    "no existing model of track - based activity recognition provides this expressiveness in a joint model .",
    "the modeling framework is naturally extensible .",
    "we are currently undertaking several extensions , including ( 1 ) developing additional activities , including following , exchanging items , and interacting with vehicles and building entrances , ( 2 ) adding prior knowledge about the spatial layout of the scene that naturally constrains what activities are possible , such as roads , sidewalks , impassible buildings , and other spatial features that influence behavior in order to improve both accuracy and speed by reducing the search space , ( 3 ) using our model as a prior for a 3d bayesian tracker @xcite , and ( 4 ) connecting natural language to activity descriptions as our model accommodates activity descriptions across multiple events , tracking individual participation throughout , providing opportunities for building natural language narratives about activities at different levels of granularity .",
