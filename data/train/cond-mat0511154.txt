    "sub - critical rupture occurs when a material is submitted to a stress lower than a critical threshold .",
    "it is known since the early work of zhurkov or brenner @xcite that sub - critical rupture can be thermally activated . however , prediction of the lifetime , i.e. the time it takes for a sample to break under a given load , has proved difficult when the material is heterogeneous .",
    "in addition , although there have been several theoretical attempts to predict the lifetime for homogeneous @xcite and sometimes disordered @xcite elastic materials , there have been very few theoretical studies of the actual rupture dynamics in heterogeneous media when thermal activation is the driving mechanism @xcite .",
    "recently , this dynamics has been modelled for a single macroscopic crack in two - dimensional homogeneous elastic media taking into account stress fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this model has been successfully faced with experiments of crack growth in fax paper sheets even though this material is actually heterogeneous @xcite . in the present letter , we will take into account heterogeneity by introducing , in the thermal activation rupture model , disorder in the rupture thresholds .",
    "we will show that disorder slows down macroscopic crack growth contrary to previous results @xcite that show the rupture dynamics to be accelerated by disorder in the case of diffuse damage .",
    "@xcite , the model that describes sub - critical crack growth in homogeneous brittle media assumes that thermal fluctuations induce local stress fluctuations with time in the elastic material according to a gaussian distribution : @xmath3\\text{,}\\ ] ] with @xmath1 the temperature in square stress unit : @xmath4 , where y is the young modulus , @xmath5 the boltzmann constant and @xmath6 the thermodynamical temperature . in eq .",

    "we assume the volume @xmath9 to break if the fluctuating local stress @xmath8 becomes larger than a critical threshold @xmath10 .",
    "in the two - dimensional case where a single crack is loaded in mode @xmath11 ( uniaxial stress perpendicular to the crack direction ) , stress concentration makes almost certain that breaking occurs at the crack tip . actually , at the crack tip , linear elasticity predicts a divergence of the stress .",
    "however , the average elastic stress @xmath12 on a volume @xmath13 at the crack tip does not diverge and can be estimated as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the crack length and @xmath16 the applied stress .",
    "the local stress on the crack tip volume @xmath9 is submitted to time fluctuations according to eq .",

    ", the scale @xmath20 corresponds to the typical paper fiber diameter",
    ". however , paper is heterogeneous and distributions in fiber size , position or orientation introduce some disorder which has not been taken into account in this model .",
    "many brittle materials are heterogeneous at a mesoscopic scale . crack front roughness is one evidence for this heterogeneity . to introduce some disorder in the model",

    ", it is clear that , during its growth , the crack is faced , in statistical average , with the whole intrinsic threshold distribution of the material .",
    "the relevance of this simplification will be discussed in the last section .",
    "using the threshold distribution of eq .",
    "( [ distribution ] ) at the crack tip , a new expression for the statistical average of the inverse crack velocity can be written :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the crack velocity for the homogeneous case . here",
    ", the inverse velocity , @xmath33 , is weighted by the threshold distribution because the waiting time for the crack to grow by a fixed step @xmath20 is the statistical variable .",
    "assuming @xmath34 , the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ velocity2 ] ) takes significative values only for a range of @xmath10 such that : ( i ) @xmath35 and the integral can be truncated from @xmath12 to @xmath36 ; ( ii ) the energy barrier @xmath37 can be considered far larger than one so that an asymptotic development of the complementary error function can be introduced in eq .",

    "( [ velocity5 ] ) even if it is the result of approximate calculations .",
    "we will now go a step further in the analysis of our model by studying the rupture time dependence with the model parameters .",

    "the results presented in this letter differ from previous theoretical works on one - dimensional disordered fiber bundle model ( 1d - dfbm ) describing the influence of disorder on the fracturing process @xcite . in this model ,",
    "as long as the critical fraction of broken fibers is less than @xmath79 @xcite , the introduction of a threshold distribution actually accelerates rupture with an effective temperature larger than the thermodynamical temperature .",
    "the rupture process starts from the weaker fibers and progressively affects the stronger ones . as a result , the distribution of breaking thresholds is truncated from below by a front moving with time towards higher thresholds . because rupture can occur everywhere in the system ,",
    "this dynamics is non - local and the damage rate is given by how many fibers break at each time step .",
    "consequently , the effect of disorder is obtained by averaging the damage rate over the threshold distribution .",
    "this is not at all the process which occurs when a large crack propagates in a disordered system . here",
    ", the probability of breaking at the crack tip is greatly enhanced by stress concentration effects even for a large disorder .",
    "then , the rupture dynamics becomes local , and one needs to average over disorder the time to break the fiber at the crack tip , i.e. the inverse of the damage rate .",
    "finally , it is worth noticing that there are similarities between our model for crack growth predicting a super - arrhenius rupture time and the trap model introduced by bouchaud @xcite to describe dynamics in glassy systems .",
    "in our analysis , we assumed the crack to grow on a straight line even if roughness is experimentally observed for sub - critical cracks in heterogeneous materials .",
    "is this hypothesis relevant for crack growth in heterogeneous materials ?",
    "two viewpoints can be raised .",
    "one could think that roughness is due to the fact a crack , at each moment , grow in the direction where the material is the weakest . in this case , the crack , during its growth , will not experience the intrinsic threshold distribution of the material , but only a part of this distribution that corresponds mainly to the lowest thresholds .",
    "then , the distribution to be used in eq .",
    "( [ distribution ] ) is not the intrinsic threshold distribution of the material .",
    "but , one could also think that crack growth occurs in the direction where the stress intensification is the largest .",
    "statistically , the larger the stress , the higher the probability to grow in the corresponding direction .",
    "this idea is supported by recent theoretical and experimental works @xcite . in this framework where the crack tip stress distribution rules the roughness , it is fair to consider the intrinsic threshold distribution of the material to rule the crack growth .",
    "experimental reality is probably a compromise between the two competing mechanisms : growth governed by stress intensification and growth following the path through the weakest regions . in the case of a material with a mesoscopic structure , such as paper ,",
    "the crack tip is surrounded by a finite number of fibers so that the crack can grow only in a finite number of directions .",
    "the determination of the growth direction is clearly due the competition between stress intensification on each fiber compared to its toughness .",
    "it is worth noticing that crack tip structure complexity can create a complex stress distribution .",
    "consequently , the largest stress is not necessarily in the crack main direction so that roughness can appear even if the crack always grows in the maximum stress direction .",
    "some numerical work has been performed to illustrate a situation where the crack is allowed to `` choose '' between a finite number of growth directions .",
    "we model a two - dimensional elastic system as a network of springs forming a lattice .",
    "more details about the simulations are given in @xcite .",
    "the only discrepancies with the simulations presented there are the use of a hexagonal lattice instead of the previously used square lattice and the introduction of a rupture threshold distribution .",
    "[ l]@xmath8    we can see in fig .",
    "[ hexa ] , that the crack can actually `` choose '' between three directions ( so called upper , straight and lower directions ) at each step . in fig .",
    "[ growthpattern ] , a typical crack pattern after a thermally activated growth is presented .",
    "we can notice that the crack grows almost straight .",
    "actually , the stress intensification on the upper and lower springs is only about @xmath80 of the one of the straight spring .",
    "so , the crack will grow through the springs on the sides only if the rupture threshold of the straight spring is very large .",
    "this is only a rare event and we can say that the crack experiences essentially the intrinsic threshold distribution truncated of the very large thresholds only . in this simulation , the crack path is mainly ruled by stress intensification .",
    "[ l]@xmath65    experimentally , the number of fibers joining at the crack tip can be larger than three so that variations in stress intensification between fibers are probably smoother than in the simulation .",
    "no definitive conclusion on the growth process can be given because , depending on the considered material , one of the two competing mechanisms ( growth governed by stress intensification and growth following the path through the weakest fibers ) will dominate .",
    "the results presented in this letter hold essentially for media where the crack path is ruled by stress intensification .",
    "assuming the existence of thermal stress fluctuations in the material , we modelled sub - critical crack growth in disordered materials .",
    "the influence of material disorder on the growth of a single crack in two - dimensional brittle elastic material is described through the introduction of a rupture threshold distribution .",
    "analytical predictions of the crack velocity and material lifetime have been derived in agreement with direct numerical calculations .",
    "the conclusion is that the crack growth process is inhibited by disorder : velocity decreases and lifetime increases with the temperature of disorder @xmath2 . the influence of disorder is simply accounted for by introducing an effective temperature @xmath45 for thermodynamical temperatures above @xmath2 .",
    "hence , lifetime follows a super - arrhenius law .",
    "more experimental work is needed to confirm this super - arrhenius regime .",
    "in addition , the analogy with glassy systems suggests that the growth of a crack in a disordered material could also occur in a `` glassy '' regime , i.e. when @xmath41 ."
