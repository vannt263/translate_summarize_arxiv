    "one of the most intriguing features of qcd for massless quarks is its underlying conformal invariance , invariance under both scale ( dilatation ) and special conformal transformations  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the case of perturbative qcd , the running coupling @xmath0 becomes constant in the limit of zero @xmath1-function and zero quark mass , and conformal symmetry becomes manifest .",
    "in fact , the renormalization scale uncertainty in pqcd predictions can be eliminated by using the principle of maximum conformality ( pmc )  @xcite . using the pmc / blm procedure  @xcite , all non -",
    "conformal contributions in the perturbative expansion series are summed into the running coupling by shifting the renormalization scale in @xmath2 from its initial value , and one obtains unique , scale - fixed , scheme - independent predictions at any finite order .",
    "one can also introduce a generalization of conventional dimensional regularization which illuminates the renormalization scheme and scale ambiguities of pqcd predictions , exposes the general pattern of nonconformal terms , and allows one to systematically determine the argument of the running coupling order by order in pqcd in a form which can be readily automatized  @xcite .",
    "the resulting pmc scales and finite - order pmc predictions are both to high accuracy independent of the choice of initial renormalization scale . for example",
    ", pmc scale - setting leads to a scheme - independent pqcd prediction  @xcite for the top - quark forward - backward asymmetry which is within one @xmath3 of the tevatron measurements .",
    "the pmc procedure also provides scale - fixed , scheme - independent commensurate scale relations  @xcite , relations between observables which are based on the underlying conformal behavior of qcd such as the generalized crewther relation  @xcite .",
    "the pmc satisfies all of the principles of the renormalization group : reflectivity , symmetry , and transitivity , and it thus eliminates an unnecessary source of systematic error in pqcd predictions  @xcite .",
    "anti - de sitter space in five dimensions ( ads@xmath4 ) provides a geometric representation of the conformal group .",
    "one can modify ads space by using a dilaton factor in the ads metric @xmath5 to introduce the qcd confinement scale .",
    "although such a mass scale explicitly breaks the dilatation invariance of the equations of motion , the action can still be conformally invariant , as was first shown by v.  de alfaro , s.  fubini and g.  furlan ( daff )  @xcite in the context of one - dimensional quantum field theory ; i.e , the change in the mass scale of the potential can be compensated by the time scale in the action . however , this manifestation of conformal symmetry can only occur if the dilaton profile @xmath6 is constrained to have the specific power @xmath7 , a remarkable result which follows from the daff construction of conformally invariant quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "the quadratic form @xmath8 leads to linear regge trajectories  @xcite in the hadron mass squared .",
    "a remarkable holographic feature of dynamics in ads space in five dimensions is that it is dual to hamiltonian theory in physical space - time , quantized at fixed light - front ( lf ) time  @xcite .",
    "for example , the equation of motion for mesons on the light - front has exactly the same single - variable form as the ads / qcd equation of motion ; one can then interpret the ads fifth dimension variable @xmath9 in terms of the physical variable @xmath10 , representing the invariant separation of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 at fixed light - front time .",
    "as discussed in the next sections , this light - front holographic principle provides a precise relation between the bound - state amplitudes in ads space and the boost - invariant lf wavefunctions describing the internal structure of hadrons in physical space - time .",
    "the resulting valence fock - state wavefunction eigensolutions of the lf qcd hamiltonian satisfy a single - variable relativistic equation of motion analogous to the nonrelativistic radial schrdinger equation . the quadratic dependence in the quark - antiquark potential @xmath13 in the light - front schrdinger equation ( lfse )",
    "is determined uniquely from conformal invariance , whereas the constant term @xmath14 is fixed by the duality between ads and lf quantization , a correspondence which follows specifically from the separation of kinematics and dynamics on the light - front  @xcite .",
    "the lf potential thus has a specific power dependence  in effect , it is a light - front harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "it is confining and reproduces the observed linear regge behavior of the light - quark hadron spectrum in both the orbital angular momentum @xmath15 and the radial node number @xmath16 .",
    "the pion is predicted to be massless in the chiral limit  @xcite - the positive contributions to @xmath17 from the lf potential and kinetic energy is cancelled by the constant term in @xmath18 for @xmath19 the derived running qcd coupling displays an infrared fixed point  @xcite .",
    "the construction of daff retains conformal invariance of the action despite the presence of a fundamental mass scale .",
    "the ads approach , however , goes beyond the purely group - theoretical considerations of daff , since features such as the masslessness of the pion and the separate dependence on @xmath20 and @xmath15 are consequences of the potential derived from the holographic lf duality with ads for general @xmath20 and @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "the quantization of qcd at fixed light - front time  @xcite ( dirac s front form ) provides a first - principles hamiltonian method for solving nonperturbative qcd .",
    "it is rigorous , has no fermion - doubling , is formulated in minkowski space , and it is frame - independent . given the boost - invariant light - front wavefunctions @xmath21 ( lfwfs ) , one can compute a large range of hadron observables , starting with structure functions , generalized parton distributions , and form factors .",
    "it is also possible to compute jet hadronization at the amplitude level from first principles from the lfwfs  @xcite .",
    "a similar method has been used to predict the production of antihydrogen from the off - shell coalescence of relativistic antiprotons and positrons  @xcite .",
    "the lfwfs of hadrons thus provide a direct connection between observables and the qcd lagrangian .",
    "solving nonperturbative qcd is thus equivalent to solving the light - front heisenberg matrix eigenvalue problem .",
    "angular momentum @xmath22 is conserved at every vertex .",
    "the lf vacuum is defined as the state of lowest invariant mass and is trivial up to zero modes .",
    "there are thus no quark or gluon vacuum condensates in the lf vacuum the corresponding physics is contained within the lfwfs themselves  @xcite , thus eliminating a major contribution to the cosmological constant .",
    "the simplicity of the front form contrasts with the usual instant - form formalism .",
    "current matrix elements defined at ordinary time @xmath23 must include the coupling of photons and vector bosons fields to connected vacuum - induced currents ; otherwise , the result is not lorentz - invariant .",
    "thus the knowledge of the hadronic eigensolutions of the instant - form hamiltonian are insufficient for determining form factors or other observables .",
    "in addition , the boost of an instant form wavefunction from @xmath24 to @xmath25 changes particle number and is an extraordinarily complicated dynamical problem .",
    "it is remarkable fact that ads / qcd , which was originally motivated by the ads / cft correspondence between gravity on a higher - dimensional space and conformal field theories in physical space - time  @xcite , has a direct holographic mapping to light - front hamiltonian theory  @xcite .",
    "the ads mass parameter @xmath26 maps to the lf orbital angular momentum .",
    "the formulae for electromagnetic  @xcite and gravitational  @xcite form factors in ads space map to the exact drell - yan - west formulae in light - front qcd  @xcite .",
    "thus the light - front holographic approach provides an analytic frame - independent first approximation to the color - confining dynamics , spectroscopy , and excitation spectra of the relativistic light - quark bound states of qcd .",
    "it is systematically improvable in full qcd using the basis light - front quantization ( blfq ) method  @xcite and other methods .",
    "in the limit of zero quark masses the longitudinal modes decouple from the invariant lf hamiltonian equation @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "the generators @xmath29 , @xmath30 , are constructed canonically from the qcd lagrangian by quantizing the system on the light - front at fixed lf time @xmath31 , @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "the lf hamiltonian @xmath33 generates the lf time evolution with respect to @xmath31 , whereas the lf longitudinal @xmath34 and transverse momentum @xmath35 are kinematical generators .",
    "it is advantageous to reduce the full multiparticle eigenvalue problem of the lf hamiltonian to an effective light - front schrdinger equation which acts on the valence sector lf wavefunction and determines each eigensolution separately  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , diagonalizing the lf hamiltonian yields all eigensolutions simultaneously , a complex task . the central problem for deriving the lfse becomes the derivation of the effective interaction @xmath36 which acts only on the valence sector of the theory and has , by definition , the same eigenvalue spectrum as the initial hamiltonian problem . in order to carry out this program",
    "one must systematically express the higher fock components as functionals of the lower ones .",
    "this method has the advantage that the fock space is not truncated , and the symmetries of the lagrangian are preserved  @xcite .",
    "the light - front hamiltonian for qcd can be derived directly from the qcd lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "the result is relativistic and frame - independent .",
    "the @xmath37 lf fock state wavefunction for a meson can be written as @xmath38 thus factoring the angular dependence @xmath39 and the longitudinal , @xmath40 , and transverse mode @xmath41 . in the limit of zero quark",
    "masses the longitudinal mode decouples and the lf eigenvalue equation @xmath42 takes the form of a light - front wave equation for @xmath43  @xcite @xmath44 \\phi_{j , l , n}(\\zeta^2 ) = m^2 \\phi_{j , l , n}(\\zeta^2),\\ ] ] a relativistic _ single - variable _ lf schrdinger equation .",
    "this equation describes the spectrum of mesons as a function of @xmath16 , the number of nodes in @xmath10 , the total angular momentum @xmath20 , which represent the maximum value of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and the internal orbital angular momentum of the constituents @xmath47 .",
    "the variable @xmath9 of ads space is identified with the lf boost - invariant transverse - impact variable @xmath10  @xcite , thus giving the holographic variable a precise definition in lf qcd  @xcite .",
    "for a two - parton bound state @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the longitudinal momentum fraction and @xmath50 is the transverse - impact distance between the quark and antiquark . in the exact qcd theory @xmath36 is related to the two - particle irreducible @xmath37 green s function .",
    "the potential in the lfse is determined from the two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) @xmath51 greens function .",
    "in particular , the higher fock states in intermediate states leads to an effective interaction @xmath52 for the valence @xmath53 fock state  @xcite .",
    "a related approach for determining the valence light - front wavefunction and studying the effects of higher fock states without truncation has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    unlike ordinary instant - time quantization ,",
    "the light - front hamiltonian equations of motion are frame independent ; remarkably , they have a structure which matches exactly the eigenmode equations in ads space .",
    "this makes a direct connection of qcd with ads methods possible .",
    "in fact , one can derive the light - front holographic duality of ads by starting from the light - front hamiltonian equations of motion for a relativistic bound - state system in physical space - time  @xcite .",
    "recently we have derived wave equations for hadrons with arbitrary spin starting from an effective action in ads space  @xcite .",
    "an essential element is the mapping of the higher - dimensional equations to the lf hamiltonian equation found in ref .",
    "this procedure allows a clear distinction between the kinematical and dynamical aspects of the lf holographic approach to hadron physics .",
    "accordingly , the non - trivial geometry of pure ads space encodes the kinematics , and the additional deformations of ads encode the dynamics , including confinement  @xcite .    a spin-@xmath20 field in ads@xmath54",
    "is represented by a rank @xmath20 tensor field @xmath55 , which is totally symmetric in all its indices . in presence of a dilaton background field",

    "the effective mass @xmath63 , which encodes kinematical aspects of the problem , is an _ a priori _ unknown function , but the additional symmetry breaking due to its @xmath9-dependence allows a clear separation of kinematical and dynamical effects  @xcite . the dilaton background field @xmath56 in ( [ seff ] ) introduces an energy scale in the five - dimensional ads action , thus breaking conformal invariance .",
    "it vanishes in the conformal ultraviolet limit @xmath64 .",
    "a physical hadron has plane - wave solutions and polarization indices along the 3 + 1 physical coordinates @xmath65 , with four - momentum @xmath66 and invariant hadronic mass @xmath67 .",
    "all other components vanish identically .",
    "the wave equations for hadronic modes follow from the euler - lagrange equation for tensors orthogonal to the holographic coordinate @xmath9 , @xmath68 .",
