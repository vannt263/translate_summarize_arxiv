    "the derivation of the transport properties of one - dimensional ( 1d ) models from the underlying microscopic dynamics is a long - standing problem in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "an especially relevant ( and vexed ) question is : what conditions are required for heat conduction to obey fourier s law ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) ? among the various 1d models , harmonic chains are the most convenient for analytical treatment and have been intensively studied over many decades .",
    "the protracted research efforts have led to the conclusion that fourier s law does not hold in 1d harmonic chains with isotopic uncorrelated disorder  @xcite , unless the baths are endowed with special spectral properties  @xcite .",
    "the interest in this topic was significantly heightened after experiments provided evidence of anomalous heat conduction in carbon and boron - nitride nanotubes  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for a review of recent experimental works ) .",
    "as shown by matsuda and ishii  @xcite , in finite harmonic chains with uncorrelated isotopic disorder most normal modes undergo anderson localisation and practically do not contribute to heat transport .",
    "the situation is different for low - frequency modes , because their localisation length exceeds the size of the chain ; these modes are essentially extended and carry energy across the system . in a random chain of @xmath1 sites there are about @xmath4 low - frequency delocalised modes  @xcite ; their form depends crucially on the boundary conditions .",
    "taking into account these facts , one can compute the heat flux with the help of the matsuda - ishii formula . after dividing the result by the temperature gradient",
    ", one eventually obtains that the conductivity scales as @xmath5 with @xmath6 for free boundary conditions and @xmath7 for fixed boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "the conductivity coefficient @xmath0 , therefore , depends on the size of the system : this implies that fourier s law can not hold , because its validity rests on @xmath0 being an intensive quantity .",
    "this phenomenon , known as anomalous heat transport , occurs in random harmonic chains with _ uncorrelated _ isotopic disorder .",
    "significant changes of the behaviour of the thermal conductivity can be expected , however , when disorder exhibits spatial correlations .",
    "in fact , as made clear by the intensive research of the past fifteen years ( see  @xcite and references therein ) , the localisation properties of the eigenstates of low - dimensional systems can be strongly modified by imposing specific correlations to the disorder .",
    "most studies of 1d models with correlated disorder have been focussed on the localisation of electronic states and electromagnetic or spin waves ; less attention has been devoted to the effects of correlated disorder on the heat conduction in harmonic chains . among the works centred on this topic",
    ", one should mention the analysis done in  @xcite , where the authors numerically studied the diffusion of a localised energy input in random harmonic chains with long - range disorder correlations . in ref .",
    "@xcite the sequence of random masses was obtained using the spectral method for the generation of a fractal brownian motion .",
    "the same model was analysed in  @xcite , where the structure of the normal modes and of the phonon spectrum was studied .    rather than focussing on long - range disorder correlations , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors considered the effects of exponentially decaying correlations .",
    "they found that correlations of this kind lead to greater high - frequency phonon transmittance for short chains and to an increased thermal resistance for long chains .",
    "the impact of specific long - range correlations was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was shown how to delocalise a finite fraction of the vibrational modes in high - frequency regions of the phononic spectrum . in this way one can obtain random chains with conductivity roughly proportional to the system size , i.e. , @xmath8 with @xmath9 , as occurs for harmonic chains without disorder .    the previous works on random chains with correlated disorder did not establish the conditions required for the onset of normal heat conduction , but their results suggested that fourier s law might be recovered by imposing specific correlations to the isotopic disorder . in this paper",
    "we show that this intuition is indeed correct and we present an approach which allows us to recover fourier s law in 1d chains by controlling how @xmath0 scales with the chain length @xmath1 .",
    "our idea goes as follows . instead of using correlations to delocalise mid - to - high frequency modes ,",
    "we now employ them to produce significant alterations of the fraction @xmath10 of low - frequency extended modes . in this way , by means of appropriate correlations , we can modify the scaling of the conductivity with the system size .",
    "in particular , we show that , for fixed boundary conditions , specific long - range correlations can produce a size - independent conductivity , thereby ensuring the validity of fourier s law even in 1d harmonic chains . for free boundary conditions one does not obtain an intensive conductivity , but",
    "other long - range correlations can make the conductivity scale with the size of the chain as @xmath2 , with @xmath3 positive but arbitrarily small .",
    "we consider a 1d harmonic chain of @xmath1 atoms with nearest - neighbours interactions and the same elastic constant @xmath11 throughout the chain .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian has the form @xmath12 here @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively represent the momentum and the displacement from the equilibrium position of the @xmath15-th atom of mass @xmath16 , while @xmath17 stands for the tridiagonal force - constant matrix with elements @xmath18 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the first and the last rows of @xmath17 determine the dynamical equation of the atoms at the extremities of the chain ; their forms depend on the chosen boundary conditions . in the case of free boundary conditions the extreme atoms interact only with their single nearest neighbour , so that the first and last rows of the force matrix are @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "for fixed boundary conditions , the outermost atoms of the chain are coupled with springs of elastic constant @xmath11 not only to their nearest neighbours , but also to external walls of infinite mass .",
    "correspondingly , one has @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "isotopic disorder enters the model  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) via random atomic masses @xmath16 which fluctuate around a common average value @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ avmass ] ) and in what follows the symbol @xmath26 denotes the average over realisations of the isotopic disorder .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath27 for the fluctuation of the @xmath15-th mass with respect to the average @xmath28 .",
    "the strength of disorder is characterised by the variance of the fluctuations @xmath29 which we assume to be finite .",
    "another key ingredient is the normalised binary correlator @xmath30 whose specific form will be defined below according to the desidered properties of the thermal conductivity .",
    "we stress that we do not need to assume the usual weak - disorder condition , @xmath31 . in the present work we are interested solely in the behaviour of the low - frequency modes , since only these modes come into play . for this reason eqs .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) and  ( [ bincor ] ) represent a sufficient description of the statistical properties of the random masses .",
    "we remark that our model is characterised by isotopic disorder .",
    "one can consider also chains with random spring constants rather than random masses .",
    "however , the model with random masses is more appropriate for the study of thermal transport , since the isotopical doping is more feasible experimentally , see ref .",
    "it should also be noted that random springs endow the model with off - diagonal disorder , whereas random masses generate purely diagonal disorder , which is mathematically easier to deal with .    to study heat transfer , the extremities of the chain",
    "must be coupled to two heat baths of given temperatures @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in the literature",
    "several models have been used for the baths .",
    "two examples are : the langevin representation , adopted in the casher - lebowitz model  @xcite , and the semi - infinite harmonic chain  @xcite .",
    "recently , a generalised langevin scheme was also considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , demostrating the role of the spectral properties of the baths in shaping the transport properties of the chain . to make our approach more transparent , in this work we use the time - honoured langevin representation of the baths .",
    "we would like to stress , however , that our results are equally valid for oscillators baths , as can be shown with the use of the formalism introduced by dhar  @xcite .    in the langevin scheme",
    "the action of the baths is mimicked by adding to the dynamical equations of the first and of the last atom an extra force composed of a dissipative term ( proportional to the speed of the atom ) and of a gaussian white noise @xmath34 .",
    "the dynamical equations of the chain thus take the form @xmath35 \\\\ & + & \\displaystyle \\delta_{nn } \\left [ \\xi_{+}(t ) -\\lambda \\frac{{p}_{n}}{m_{n } } \\right ] \\end{array } \\label{dyneq}\\ ] ] with @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in eq .",
    "( [ dyneq ] ) , @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent independent gaussian white noises with zero average , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 we use the symbol @xmath42 to represent the average over different realisations of the thermal noises . as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ dyneq ] ) and  ( [ noise_corr ] ) , both baths are coupled with the same constant @xmath43 to the chain .    as is well known , in harmonic chains the heat flux is given by the sum of the modal fluxes .",
    "in the stationary regime and for weak coupling of the chain to the baths , the total flux is given by the matsuda - ishii formula  @xcite @xmath44^{2 } \\left [ e_{n}^{(i ) } \\right]^{2 } } { m_{n } \\left [ e_{1}^{(i ) } \\right]^{2 } + m_{1 } \\left [ e_{n}^{(i ) } \\right]^{2 } } \\label{mi_formula}\\ ] ] where the symbols @xmath45 represents the @xmath15-th component of the @xmath46-th displacement eigenvector , as defined by the equation @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ displ_ev ] ) , @xmath48 is the rescaled force - constant matrix with elements @xmath49 and the chain eigenfrequencies are labelled in ascending order : @xmath50 .",

    "one has @xmath57 with @xmath58 . in what follows",
    "we will use the short - hand notation @xmath59 .    when disorder is added , the normal modes suffer anderson localisation , provided that the size of the chain is sufficiently large .",
    "we remark that the effective random potential felt by the @xmath46-th mode is given by @xmath60 taking into account eqs .",
    "( [ mass_fluct ] ) and  ( [ sigma ] ) , it is easy to see that the effective potential  ( [ eff_pot ] ) has zero average , @xmath61 , and variance @xmath62 we restrict our attention to the low - frequency modes , identified by the condition @xmath63 for these modes the effective random potential is weak , as can be seen by considering that the deterministic part of the diagonal term in eq .",
    "( [ dyneq1 ] ) is much larger than the random potential  ( [ eff_pot ] ) .",
    "in fact , when condition  ( [ low_freq ] ) is satisfied , one has @xmath64 note that condition  ( [ low_freq ] ) ensures that the relation  ( [ weak_eff_dis ] ) holds even if @xmath65 .    for the low - frequency modes one can use the hamiltonian map approach described in  @xcite and obtain the following expression for the inverse localisation length @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ lyap ] ) the factor @xmath67 represents the power spectrum of the random sequence @xmath68 , i.e. , @xmath69    following  @xcite , we can now use formula  ( [ lyap ] ) to estimate the number @xmath70 of extended modes . in a finite chain ,",
    "a mode can be considered extended if its localisation length @xmath71 exceeds the chain length @xmath1 , i.e. , if the condition @xmath72 is satisfied . because low - frequency modes experience weak disorder , their eigenfrequencies stay close to the corresponding values for an homogeneous chain and one can still use eq .",

    "( [ deloc_cond ] ) the approximate expression @xmath73 with @xmath74 .",
    "condition  ( [ deloc_cond ] ) , supplemented by eq .  ( [ freq ] ) , leads to the conclusion that the number @xmath75 of extended modes is obtained by solving the equation @xmath76",

    "( [ mi_formula ] ) by taking into account that the main contribution is due to the @xmath70 extended modes , and that they have essentially the same form of those of an ordered chain . in this way , for @xmath77 one obtains @xmath78 for fixed boundary conditions and @xmath79 for free boundary conditions . dividing the heat flux by the temperature gradient , one eventually arrives at the result that the conductivity scales as @xmath80    for uncorrelated disorder @xmath81 and with eq .",
    "( [ exten_modes ] ) we recover the well - known result  @xcite @xmath82 substituting this result in eq .",

    "these remarkable results were established in the early 1970s by several authors  @xcite and led to the crucial conclusion that fourier s law _ can not _ hold in 1d disordered chains . since then",
    ", this discovery has been the subject of an intense debate ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyse whether spatial correlations of the disorder can produce an intensive conductivity and thus lead to normal heat conduction .",
    "we also want to explore the possibility to have other scaling laws for @xmath0 as a function of @xmath1 . to proceed in this direction",
    "one has to understand first how specific correlations of the isotopic disorder can change the number of low - frequency extended states and , therefore , alter the scaling behaviour of the conductivity .",

    "( [ low_freq_ps ] ) into the condition  ( [ deloc_cond ] ) , one obtains that the number of extended modes becomes @xmath89 with @xmath90 since @xmath86 , the values of @xmath91 are restricted to the interval @xmath92 . after substituting the result  ( [ ext_modes ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ kappa_scaling_law ] ) , one can conclude that the conductivity obeys the power law  ( [ power_law_scaling ] ) with scaling exponent @xmath93 equal to @xmath94 eq .",

    "it shows how disorder correlations can change the scaling of the conductivity with the size of the chain .",
    "two special cases stand out for their interest .",
    "for fixed boundary conditions , one can consider the value @xmath95 in eq .",
    "( [ low_freq_ps ] ) .",
    "this implies that the power spectrum decreases linearly with the frequency in the limit @xmath96 ; the corresponding binary correlator  ( [ bincor ] ) decays with a power - law @xmath97 for @xmath98 . from eq .",
    "( [ kappa_scaling ] ) , it is easy to see that for @xmath95 the scaling exponent of the conductivity vanishes , so that the conductivity becomes independent of the size of the chain , @xmath99 .",
    "the physical mechanism behind this result is easy to understand . for @xmath95 ,",
    "the inverse localisation length  ( [ lyap ] ) scales as @xmath100 rather than being a quadratic function of the frequency as in the case of uncorrelated disorder .",
    "therefore , the number of extended modes is _ increased _ due to the chosen correlations , and one has @xmath101 instead of @xmath102 .",
    "the increase of summands in eq .",
    "( [ jfixed ] ) compensates the @xmath103 scaling of the displacement eigenvectors and produces an intensive conductivity .",
    "therefore , fourier s law emerges in the asymptotic regime , i.e. , for @xmath77 .    for free boundary conditions ,",
    "a case of physical interest corresponds to a power spectrum _ diverging _ for @xmath96 as @xmath104 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath105 , with @xmath3 being a small but positive parameter . in this case",
    "the correlation function decays extremely slowly over large distances : @xmath106 for @xmath98 .",
    "the choice @xmath105 implies that the localisation length scales as @xmath107 in the low - frequency region .",

    "this reduction of the extended modes leads to the result @xmath110 since condition  ( [ normalisation ] ) requires @xmath111 , one can not exactly obtain a normal conduction for free boundary conditions by manipulating the low - frequency behaviour of the power spectrum .",
