    "the problem of counting the number of ways in which a given permutation can be factored into a given number of transpositions is of perennial interest in algebraic combinatorics .",
    "usually , one considers this problem in the presence of constraints on the factors , e.g. that they should be transpositions of a certain type , or should collectively generate a certain group , etc . by varying these constraints ,",
    "one obtains enumeration problems which enjoy surprising connections with other branches of mathematics .",
    "the earliest enumerative study of transposition factorizations was carried out by hurwitz @xcite in the nineteenth century .",
    "motivated by a problem from enumerative algebraic geometry , namely the counting of almost simple ramified covers of the sphere by other riemann surfaces , hurwitz published an explicit formula for the number of _ minimal transitive factorizations _ of an arbitrary permutation into transpositions .",
    "there are two constraints in the hurwitz factorization problem : `` minimality , '' which requires that the number of transpositions used should be as small as possible , and `` transitivity , '' which requires that the factors should act transitively on the points @xmath0 hurwitz s formula for the number of minimal transitive factorizations of a permutation @xmath1 of cycle type @xmath2 is @xmath3 as a particularly beautiful special case , hurwitz s formula yields that the number of factorizations of a full cycle in @xmath4 into @xmath5 transpositions is @xmath6 the number of trees on @xmath7 labelled vertices .",
    "this case of hurwitz s formula was independently rediscovered and popularized by dnes @xcite .",
    "the general hurwitz formula was independently rediscovered by goulden and jackson @xcite , to whom the first rigorous proof is due .",
    "a key feature of the hurwitz factorization problem is centrality : the number of minimal transitive factorizations of @xmath8 depends only on the cycle type of @xmath9 this remains true for transitive factorizations of arbitrary length .",
    "a different choice of constraints leading to a non - central factorization problem was considered by stanley @xcite , who initiated the study of what he termed _ reduced decompositions_. these are minimal factorizations in which the transpositions allowed to be used as factors are the coxeter generators @xmath10 reduced decompositions are also referred to as _ sorting networks _ because of their relation to the bubblesort algorithm familiar to computer scientists .",
    "they could also be called _ minimal coxeter factorizations_. the enumeration of reduced decompositions is complicated by its non - centrality , and has spawned its own extensive literature , see @xcite for a beautiful introduction .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of random reduced decompositions is the subject of an intriguing set of conjectures due to angel et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the coxeter factorization problem naturally fits into a wider class of constrained factorization problems , in which the factors are chosen from a specified set of transpositions which generate @xmath11 a second example from from this class was considered by pak @xcite , who initiated the study of _",
    "star factorizations_. these are factorizations in which the transpositions allowed to be used as factors have the form @xmath12 for example , the unique minimal star factorization of @xmath13 is @xmath14 thanks to recent work of irving and rattan @xcite , goulden and jackson @xcite , and fray @xcite , the combinatorics of star factorizations is now completely understood .",
    "recently , gewurz and merola @xcite posed the problem of enumerating transposition factorizations under a constraint on the order of the factors .",
    "a factorization @xmath15 of @xmath1 into a product of @xmath16 transpositions is called _ primitive _ if @xmath17 i.e. if its factors appear in weakly increasing order with respect to the larger element in each .",
    "for example , @xmath13 can be factored into a product of two transpositions in three ways , @xmath18 but only the first two of these factorizations are primitive .",
    "gewurz and merola obtain the interesting result that the number of primitive factorizations of the cycle @xmath19 into @xmath5 transpositions ( i.e. the number of minimal primitive factorizations ) is the catalan number @xmath20 this result should be considered in tandem with hurwitz s @xmath21-count of unrestricted factorizations of @xmath22    in this extended abstract prepared for fpsac 2010 , we will give an overview of the authors ongoing work on the enumeration of primitive factorizations .",
    "first we study minimal primitive factorizations , and obtain an analogue of hurwitz s formula , i.e. an explicit formula which counts minimal primitive factorizations of an arbitrary permutation ( theorem [ thm : minimaltype ] and corollary [ cor : minimaltotal ] below )",
    ". then we present a link between the primitive factorization problem and jucys - murphy elements .",
    "this connection explains the centrality of the primitive factorization problem , and allows us to use character theory to enumerate primitive factorizations of a full cycle into any number of transpositions ( theorem [ thm : centralfactorial ] below ) .",
    "finally , we discuss a surprising connection between the primitive factorization problem and the theory of matrix models : generating functions enumerating primitive factorizations may be expressed as integrals over groups of unitary matrices against the haar measure ( theorem [ thm : matrixintegral ] below ) .",
    "it turns out that these integrals are of independent interest and have a long history in mathematical physics .",
    "any primitive factorization of @xmath8 into @xmath16 transpositions has the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a weak @xmath25-part composition of @xmath26 we will say that the above factorization is of type @xmath27 if the frequencies @xmath28 coincide with the parts of @xmath29 after reordering . for example , there are three primitive factorizations of @xmath30 of type @xmath31 namely @xmath32    let us now enumerate minimal primitive factorizations by type .",
    "let @xmath33 denote the set of all weakly increasing sequences @xmath34 of @xmath16 positive integers such that @xmath35 for @xmath36 and @xmath37 it is not difficult to show that @xmath38 given a partition @xmath39 one may introduce a refinement @xmath40 of the catalan number by declaring @xmath40 to be the number of sequences in @xmath33 of type @xmath41 then , by definition , @xmath42 these refined catalan numbers have previously been studied by haiman @xcite and stanley @xcite in connection with parking functions , and are known explicitly : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the multiplicity of @xmath45 in @xmath41 finally , given a pair of partitions @xmath46 , introduce the set of sequences of partitions @xmath47 thus sequences in @xmath48 are obtained by breaking parts of @xmath49 in such a way that , after sorting , one obtains @xmath41 if @xmath48 is non - empty , then @xmath29 is said to be a refinement of @xmath50    [ thm : minimaltype ] let @xmath1 be a permutation of reduced is the partition obtained by subtracting one from the length of each of its cycles .",
    "thus the size of the reduced cycle type of @xmath8 is the length of a minimal factorization of @xmath8 into transpositions . ]",
    "cycle type @xmath51 , and let @xmath29 be another partition of @xmath26 the number of primitive factorizations of @xmath8 of type @xmath29 is @xmath52    as an example , consider the permutation @xmath53 this permutation has reduced cycle type @xmath54 so the length of a minimal primitive factorization of @xmath8 is eight . by theorem [ thm :",
    "minimaltype ] , the number of minimal primitive factorizations of @xmath8 of type @xmath55 is @xmath56    the proof of theorem [ thm : minimaltype ] is bijective , and we refer the reader to our full - length article @xcite for details . as a corollary of this result",
    ", we obtain an elegant formula which counts the total number of minimal primitive factorizations of an arbitrary permutation .",
    "gewurz and merola s result is recovered as the case @xmath57 of this corollary .",
    "[ cor : minimaltotal ] let @xmath1 be a permutation of non - reduced cycle type @xmath58 the total number of primitive factorizations of @xmath8 into @xmath59 transpositions is @xmath60",
    "we will now give an algebraic explanation of the fact that the primitive factorization problem is central .",
    "let @xmath61 $ ] denote the group algebra of the symmetric group , and @xmath62 its center .",
    "the center is a commutative algebra with canonical basis @xmath63 consisting of the conjugacy classes of @xmath64 for this reason we call @xmath62 the _ class algebra_.    let @xmath65 denote the algebra of symmetric functions over @xmath66 we define a specialization @xmath67 as follows",
    ". for @xmath68 put @xmath69 thus @xmath70,$ ] with @xmath71 the elements so defined are called _ jucys - murphy elements_. they were introduced independently by jucys @xcite and murphy @xcite .",
    "these simple elements have many remarkable properties , some of which we will make use of here . diverse applications of the jucys - murphy elements are found in the work of okounkov @xcite and okounkov and vershik @xcite .",
    "although @xmath72 for @xmath73 the jm elements do belong to the gelfand - zetlin subalgebra of @xmath61.$ ] this is the maximal commutative subalgebra of @xmath61 $ ] generated by the class algebras @xmath74 where @xmath75 are embedded in @xmath61 $ ] in the canonical way .",
    "this is clear , since @xmath76 is by definition the difference of an element of @xmath77 and an element of @xmath78 consequently , the jm elements commute with one another , and we may define the alphabet @xmath79 and evaluate symmetric functions on this alphabet .",
    "it is a remarkable result of jucys that , for any @xmath80 @xmath81 thus symmetric functions of jm elements are central , and we have the _ jm specialization _ @xmath82    the jm specialization gives a very clean proof of the centrality of the primitive factorization problem .",
    "let @xmath83 denote the complete homogoneous symmetric function of degree @xmath84 i.e. @xmath85 the sum of all degree @xmath16 monomials in the variables @xmath86 then , by jucys result , @xmath87 and we may write @xmath88 for some coefficients @xmath89 on the other hand , we have that @xmath90 thus , for any permutation @xmath1 of cycle type @xmath91 we have that @xmath92 in other words , the combinatorial problem of counting primitive factorizations is equivalent to the algebraic problem of resolving @xmath93 with respect to the canonical basis of the class algebra @xmath94 more generally , for any partition @xmath29 one may consider the resolution @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the monomial symmetric function of type @xmath41 we then have , for any @xmath97 @xmath98",

    "we already know that the number of minimal primitive factorizations of @xmath111 i.e. those consisting of @xmath5 transpositions , is the catalan number @xmath112 we will now solve the problem when the number of transpositions used is allowed to be arbitrary .",
    "as we will see momentarily , this problem has an unexpectedly simple and beautiful solution .",
    "let @xmath113 be an indeterminate , and form the generating function @xmath114 this generating function is an element of the algebra @xmath115 $ ] of single - variable formal power series with coefficients in the class algebra @xmath94 by jucys character expansion result , we have @xmath116 where the last line follows from the generating function @xmath117 for the elementary symmetric functions .",
    "note that this computation shows that the generating function @xmath118 is actually a _ rational _ function over @xmath94    now , given @xmath119 in order to obtain the generating function @xmath120 we simply take the corresponding traces of the conjugacy class @xmath121 in each irreducible representation , to obtain a rational function over @xmath122 @xmath123 up until this point , the partition @xmath124 has been generic , but now we restrict to the special case @xmath125 the partition of @xmath7 with a single part .",
    "a classical result from representation theory informs us that the trace of @xmath126 in an irreducible representation can only be non - zero in `` hook '' representations : @xmath127 now , the content alphabet of a hook diagram may be obtained immediately , @xmath128 so that @xmath129 for example , if @xmath130 this is a rational function of the form @xmath131 thus , as an irreducible rational function , @xmath132 has the form @xmath133 where @xmath134 are some constants to be determined momentarily .    before finding the above coefficients ,",
    "let us consider the generating function @xmath135 the coefficients in this generating function are complete symmetric functions evaluated on the alphabet @xmath136 of square integers .",
    "reason dictates that they ought to be close relatives of the stirling numbers @xmath137 the stirling number @xmath138 has the following combinatorial interpretation : it counts the number of partitions @xmath139 of an @xmath140-element set into @xmath141 disjoint non - empty subsets .",
    "stirling numbers are given by the explicit formula @xmath142 the numbers @xmath143 are known as _ central factorial numbers_. the central factorial numbers were studied classically by carlitz and riordan , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* exercise 5.8 ) for references .",
    "they have the following combinatorial interpretation : @xmath144 counts the number of partitions @xmath145 of a set of @xmath140 marked and @xmath140 unmarked points into @xmath141 disjoint non - empty subsets such that , for each block @xmath146 if @xmath45 is the least integer such that either @xmath45 or @xmath147 appears in @xmath146 then @xmath148 central factorial numbers are given by the explicit formula @xmath149    now let us determine the unknown constants @xmath150 by the above discussion , the generating function @xmath132 has the form @xmath151 on the other hand , by the results of the previous sections , @xmath152 consequently , we must have @xmath153 and we have proved the following result .",
    "[ thm : centralfactorial ] for any @xmath154 the number of primitive factorizations of @xmath19 into @xmath155 transpositions is @xmath156 where @xmath144 denotes the carlitz - riordan central factorial number .",
    "equivalently , we have the generating function @xmath157",
    "finally , we come to what is perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the primitive factorization problem : its connection with matrix models .",
    "the theory of matrix models has its origins in an area of mathematical physics known as quantum field theory , see @xcite for a solid introduction . for our purposes ,",
    "the following grossly oversimplified description of matrix model theory suffices :    1 .",
    "pick an interesting subset @xmath158 of the space @xmath159 of all @xmath160 complex matrices .",
    "2 .   put an interesting probability measure @xmath161 on @xmath162 3 .",
    "select an interesting random variable ( measurable function ) @xmath163 4 .",
    "compute the expected value @xmath164 of the random variable @xmath165 ( possibly after rescaling ) as a power series in @xmath166 @xmath167 5 .",
    "realize that the coefficients @xmath168 occurring in the above perturbative expansion have an interesting combinatorial interpretation .",
    "this informal discussion is meant to convey the impression that , from a combinatorial perspective , matrix integrals may sometimes play the role of generating functions .",
    "it sometimes happens that a traditional generating function is difficult to obtain , but that by running the above steps in reverse one can concoct a matrix integral which encodes a sequence of interest",
    ". furthermore , some matrix models have special features that are very useful , and these features can be used to extract combinatorial information in the generating function spirit .",
    "for example , it might be that an integral of interest can be exactly evaluated , thereby yielding an explicit generating function for the sequence it encodes ( see @xcite for a famous example ) .",
    "even if this is not the case , it often happens that matrix integrals interact well with more advanced analytical tools , such as orthogonal polynomials or integrable systems of differential equations ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and this may again yield insight into combinatorial structure .",
    "let us present a matrix model for primitive factorizations .",
    "for our space of matrices we select the group @xmath169 of @xmath160 complex unitary matrices .",
    "since @xmath169 is compact , it carries a unique left and right translation invariant probability measure , the haar measure @xmath170 which we take for our probability measure of interest .",
    "now we will select an interesting random variable , or rather class of random variables , @xmath171 it would certainly be nice if we could compute the expected value @xmath172 of any polynomial function of the entries of @xmath173 and @xmath174 since we can approximate a large class of functions on @xmath169 by polynomials in matrix coefficients ( think stone - weierstrass / peter - weyl ) . by linearity of the integral , it suffices to consider the case where @xmath175 is a monomial .",
    "furthermore , an easy argument using the invariance of the haar measure shows that the expected value of such a monomial will be zero unless @xmath175 is of equal degree in the entries of @xmath173 and @xmath176 ( think integrals of the form @xmath177 over the unit circle @xmath178 ) .",
    "thus we need only consider integrals of the form @xmath179 where the lowercase @xmath180 s are matrix elements and @xmath181 are functions .",
    "integrals of this form are called _",
    "@xmath7-point correlation functions _ of matrix elements .",
    "they are actually of considerable interest in mathematical physics @xcite and free probability theory @xcite .",
    "it is known that , provided @xmath182 the computation of the @xmath7-point functions can be reduced to the computation of `` permutation correlators '' @xmath183 finally , recall that we have defined @xmath184 and that this quantity can be non - zero only for @xmath16 of the form @xmath185 therefore let us introduce the notation @xmath186 it is not unreasonable to think of @xmath187 as a combinatorially motivated analogue of the usual hurwitz number @xcite @xmath188 obtained by replacing the transitivity constraint with the primitivity constraint .",
    "unfortunately , we will not be able to say much about the proof of this result here .",
    "suffice to say that that theorem [ thm : matrixintegral ] arises from two points of view regarding the orthogonal projection of @xmath191 onto the commutant @xmath192 the first point of view involves the permutation correlators and the second involves understanding the element @xmath193 in the left - regular representation of @xmath61;$ ] the equivalence of the two is , in a sense , a manifestation of the schur - weyl duality between the representation theories of @xmath4 and @xmath194 we refer the interested reader to our articles @xcite for further details regarding the proof of theorem [ thm : matrixintegral ] , and its applications .",
    "let us conclude with the following comparison of unrestricted and primitive factorizations of a full cycle : @xmath195 }          \\bigg { ( } \\frac{\\sinh z/2}{z/2 } \\bigg{)}^{n-1 } \\\\",
