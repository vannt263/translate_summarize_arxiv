    "to what extent can a ` nearly collisionless ' @xmath0-body system such as a nonneutral plasma or a charged particle beam be modeled by a smooth density distribution and a smooth bulk potential , either statistically or at the level of individual orbits ?",
    "in particular , is there a well defined @xmath2 continuum limit ?",
    "the idealisation of a smooth potential is extremely convenient , both conceptually and computationally .",
    "however , as noted , _",
    "e.g. , _ by beam dynamicists  @xcite , it is not completely clear when  or if  such an idealisation is justified .    even assuming that there is a well - defined continuum limit , how large must @xmath0 be before the continuum approximation is justified ? and to what extent can residual discreteness effects be modeled in the context of a fokker - planck description ?",
    "the conventional fokker - planck description  @xcite@xcite was formulated to extract statistical properties of orbit ensembles and distribution functions over long time scales , assuming implicitly that the bulk potential is regular . to what extent ,",
    "then , can langevin realisations  @xcite of a fokker - planck equation yield reliable information about individual orbits over comparatively short time scales , particularly if the orbits are chaotic ?    this is an issue of practical importance for systems like high intensity charged - particle beams . in older , low intensity beams ,",
    "the contribution of the space charge to the total potential is comparatively minor compared to the confining magnetic field , but in high intensity beams the space charge can become extremely important . to what extent , then , is one justified in idealising the space charge by a smooth density distribution that generates a smooth macroscopic potential ?",
    "e.g. , _ really legitimate to ignore discreteness effects entirely in a bunch comprised of @xmath10 protons with a transverse emittance of a few microns ?",
    "the situation is especially suspect in that experience with ` nearly collisionless ' self - gravitating systems  @xcite indicates that the continuum limit must be subtle .",
    "one believes that , for @xmath2 , orbits in an @xmath0-body system will in fact converge towards characteristics in the corresponding smooth potential .",
    "however , @xmath0-body orbits evolved in a density distribution corresponding to an integrable potential are typically ` very chaotic ' with large positive lyapunov exponents even though the integrable characteristics have vanishing lyapunov exponent !    for flows in smooth potentials , it is straightforward to distinguish macroscopically between phase mixing associated with regular versus chaotic orbits  @xcite . in particular , chaotic flows tend to mix exponentially fast , whereas regular flows only mix as a more modest power law in time .",
    "will this distinction persist in @xmath0-body systems ?",
    "one might , _",
    "e.g. , _ worry that if @xmath0-body orbits corresponding to integrable characteristics have large positive lyapunov exponents , ` regular ' flows comprised of such orbits would exhibit behaviour resembling chaotic phase mixing in smooth potentials ! understanding the bulk properties of phase mixing in @xmath0-body systems is important , _",
    "e.g. , _ in light of recent grid code simulations  @xcite indicating that chaotic phase mixing may be responsible for ` anomalous relaxation ' observed in charged - particle beams , including the university of maryland ` five beamlet ' experiment  @xcite",
    ".    a complete resolution of these issues will require an analysis of ` honest ' ( _ i.e. , _ direct summation  @xcite ) numerical integrations for systems comprised of very large particle number @xmath0 , which is not yet practical .",
    "however , considerable insight may be derived by considering the simpler case of orbits and orbit ensembles evolved in ` frozen-@xmath0 ' systems , _",
    "i.e. , _ time - independent @xmath0-body systems generated by randomly sampling a specified smooth density distribution . in particular , by comparing orbits in such frozen-@xmath0 systems with characteristics with the same initial condition evolved in the corresponding smooth potential , one can quantify the extent to which , as a function of @xmath0 , @xmath0-body orbits and smooth potential characteristics actually coincide .",
    "such is the objective of this paper .",
    "section ii focuses on the behaviour of orbits and orbit ensembles in frozen-@xmath0 realisations of two simple potentials , one integrable and the other almost completely chaotic .",
    "the principal conclusions here are ( i ) that there is a well - defined macroscopic convergence towards the continuum limit , both for individual orbits and for orbit ensembles , and ( ii ) that discreteness effects can be extremely well - mimicked by gaussian white noise in the context of a fokker - planck or langevin description .",
    "section iii considers the more realistic ` thermal equilibrium model '  @xcite , well known from beam dynamics . for appropriate choices of parameter values ,",
    "this model admits  @xcite large measures of both regular and chaotic orbits , so that one encounters a new feature  @xcite , namely transitions between regular and chaotic behaviour triggered by discreteness effects . as for the simpler models considered in section",
    "ii , one observes clear distinctions between regular and chaotic phase mixing , although discreteness effects , again well modeled by a fokker - planck description , can be surprisingly important . even when @xmath0 is large , individual orbits can exhibit frequent changes in behaviour corresponding macroscopically to transitions between regularity and chaos ; and the scaling implict in a fokker - planck description suggests that , for chaotic orbits , _ even a total particle number as large as @xmath11 may not be large enough to justify a continuum limit . _",
    "section iv focuses on lyapunov exponents and the meaning of chaos in @xmath0-body systems .",
    "the principal conclusion here is that two distinct ` types ' of chaos can be present in the @xmath0-body problem , characterised by _ two different sets of lyapunov exponents associated with physics on different scales . _",
    "close encounters between particles trigger _ microchaos _ , a generic feature of the @xmath0-body problem , which leads to large positive lyapunov exponents @xmath8 . if , however , the bulk smooth potential is chaotic , one also encounters _ macrochaos _ , which is again characterised by positive , albeit typically much smaller , lyapunov exponents @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath0-body realisations of integrable systems remain chaotic , even for large @xmath0 , in the sense that @xmath8 does not decrease towards zero for @xmath2 . despite this",
    ", however , microchaos becomes progressively less important macroscopically in that the _ range _ of this chaos , _",
    "i.e. , _ the scale on which the microchaos - driven exponential divergence of nearby orbits terminates , decreases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "section v summarises the principal conclusions and speculates on potential implications .",
    "the computations described in this section were performed for two models which , albeit not representative of ` real ' equilibrium systems , are of significant pedagogical value in illustrating the nature of the continuum limit . in particular , since one model is integrable and the other almost completely chaotic , it is simple to identify separately how discreteness effects impact regular versus chaotic orbits , an issue that becomes more difficult in ` realistic ' systems which admit a complex coexistence of both regular and chaotic orbits .",
    "_ model 1 .",
    "_ a constant density triaxial ellipsoid , for which @xmath12 with @xmath13 for @xmath14 , this corresponds to a space - charge potential @xmath15 with @xmath16 a constant and frequencies @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 related to the axis values @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 in terms of incomplete elliptic integrals . the system was assumed confined by an external potential @xmath23 .",
    "it follows that , in the continuum limit , each charge evolves in an integrable time - independent potential of the form ( modulo a constant ) @xmath24 attention focused primarily on the parameter values @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , which , assuming units for which @xmath28 , implies  @xcite that @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "it follows that the orbital time scale @xmath32 .",
    "because this potential is integrable , one knows that , in the continuum limit , only regular phase mixing is possible .",
    "however , the situation is even more exceptional : because of the harmonic character of the potential , _",
    "i.e. , _ the fact that the force is linear , every charge will orbit with the same frequencies so that , in the absence of discreteness effects , there can be no systematic phase mixing and no emittance growth in an initially localised clump . _ all emittance growth associated with this potential must be attributed to discreteness effects . _",

    "_ perturbing model 1 by introducing a spherically symmetric , attractive spike of charge near the origin , which yields a modified potential @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "attention here focused on a central charge @xmath35 , which leads to a potential for which , for orbits restricted energetically to @xmath14 , _ the phase space is almost completely chaotic _  @xcite .",
    "( the bulk properties of the potential are insensitive to the precise value of @xmath36 for @xmath37 or so ; but most of the chaos is lost for much larger values of @xmath36 . )",
    "frozen-@xmath0 charge density distributions of the form @xmath38 were generated by randomly sampling the smooth density distributions @xmath39 .",
    "these correspond to @xmath0-body potentials @xmath40 which incorporate a tiny softening parameter @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "unless otherwise stated , all figures in this paper were generated from integrations with @xmath42 .",
    "orbits were integrated in frozen-@xmath0 realisations with @xmath43 using a variable time step scheme that conserved the energy of each charge to at least one part in @xmath44 .",
    "estimates of the largest ( finite time ) lyapunov exponent  @xcite were obtained in the usual way by simultaneously tracking the evolution of a small initial perturbation , periodically renormalised at fixed time intervals @xmath45 .",
    "the efficacy of phase mixing was tested by generating localised clumps of 1600 initial conditions sampling a phase space region of size @xmath46 and evolving these into the future in both the smooth potential and the corresponding @xmath0-body potential ( 7 ) .",
    "the resulting orbital data were analysed to compute emittances @xmath47 as well as the total @xmath48    the degree to which individual @xmath0-body orbits did , or did not , ` look highly irregular ' was quantified by computing the _ orbital complexity _",
    "@xcite of their fourier spectra .",
    "this entailed determining for each orbit the quantities @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , defined as the minimum number of frequencies required to capture a fixed fraction @xmath52 of the power in each direction , and then assigning a total complexity @xmath53 in order to obtain a reasonably sharp fourier spectrum , orbital data were typically recorded at intervals @xmath54 , a time corresponding to less than 1% of a typical orbital period .      in the continuum limit ,",
    "initially localised clumps characterised by the integrable potential ( 4 ) exhibit no systematic tendency to disperse .",
    "because each orbit executes harmonic motions with the same three frequencies , the charges remain close together , returning to their original @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , after periods @xmath58 , @xmath59 , an @xmath60 .",
    "discreteness effects break this exact periodicity and trigger a systematic spread .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 1 , which exhibits the @xmath61 and @xmath62 coordinates of the same 1600 orbit ensemble with @xmath63 at five different times , allowing for frozen-@xmath0 backgrounds with @xmath64 and @xmath65 . for @xmath64 ,",
    "this dispersal is comparatively rapid , the charges having spread to sample the entire allowable configuration space within @xmath66 , a time corresponding to only 10 orbital periods or so . for the larger system with @xmath65 ,",
    "the dispersal is considerably slower , requiring a time @xmath67 , roughly four times larger , to achieve a comparable spread .",
    "the situation is very different for the potential ( 5 ) , for which , even in the continuum limit , the particle phase space is almost completely chaotic . in this case",
    ", one observes exponentially fast chaotic phase mixing in the smooth potential , and allowing for discreteness effects only accelerates the process .",
    "this is evident from figure 2 , which exhibits the @xmath61 and @xmath62 coordinates for a 1600 orbit clump , again with @xmath63 , evolved in frozen-@xmath0 realisations with @xmath64 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , as well as ( in the right hand column ) the smooth potential . even for the smooth potential ,",
    "a time @xmath70 is sufficient for particles to sample most of the energetically accessible phase space .",
    "the visual impression that the chaotic clump disperses far more rapidly can be quantified by computing the emittance @xmath71 as a function of time .",
    "the left hand column of figure 3 exhibits @xmath72 for the same ensemble of initial conditions used to generate figure 1 , now allowing for frozen-@xmath0 backgrounds with @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and and @xmath77 . for the smallest value of @xmath0",
    "it is not completely clear whether @xmath71 grows exponentially or as a power law in time .",
    "however , for @xmath78 , the growth is distinctly subexponential .",
    "indeed , the data for @xmath78 are well fit by an emittance growth law @xmath79 where @xmath80 extrapolating to the limit @xmath2 yields the expected result that there can be no systematic emittance growth .",
    "the left hand column of figure 4 exhibits analogous results for the initial conditions used to generate figure 2 , now plotted on a logarithmic scale , allowing for @xmath81 , @xmath74 , @xmath76 , @xmath82 , and , in the bottom panel , the smooth potential .",
    "it is evident that , for the smooth potential , @xmath83 exhibits a roughly linear growth during the interval ( say ) @xmath84 , corresponding to an exponential growth in emittance .",
    "this is hardly surprising .",
    "the fact that individual orbits in the clump are chaotic implies that they should diverge exponentially so that , at least for small @xmath85 , one would expect @xmath71 to grow exponentially at a rate comparable to the value of a typical ( finite time ) lyapunov exponent @xmath9 for the smooth potential . for this ensemble ,",
    "the mean exponent for the interval @xmath86 assumed the value @xmath87 , which corresponds to the slope of the dashed line in panel ( i ) .",
    "allowing for discreteness effects clearly accelerates the rate of chaotic phase mixing .",
    "for the two smaller values of @xmath0 , @xmath88 and @xmath74 , the growth again appears exponential , albeit at a larger rate ; but for the systems with @xmath68 and @xmath82 the evolution is clearly more complex .",
    "indeed , a careful examination of the data for these two cases suggests strongly that the evolution can be decomposed into two largely distinct exponential phases , the former characterised by a growth rate @xmath89 and the latter by a slower rate @xmath90 .",
    "this is consistent with the analysis to be presented later in section iv , which indicates that two sorts of chaos can act in @xmath0-body systems , large scale _ macrochaos _ characterised by a lyapunov exponent @xmath9 and shorter range _ microchaos _ characterised by a lyapunov exponent @xmath91 .",
    "( for very small @xmath0 , the microchaos also acts on macroscopic scales , thus overwhelming any observational effects associated with the much weaker macrochaos : hence the ( near-)absence of the second exponential phase in panels ( a ) and ( c ) ! ) the data summarised in figure 4 are consistent with a second exponential phase with @xmath92 the form of which will be motivated in section iid .",
    "the results derived here for model 2 which , in the continuum limit , corresponds to a chaotic potential , are likely generic for bulk density distributions corresponding to a chaotic potential . however ,",
    "the results for model 1 are special in that there is no systematic emittance growth in the continuum limit . if , as one would expect in a ` real ' system , the bulk potential exhibits at least some anharmonicities , regular phase mixing will trigger linear emittance growth even in the continuum limit . in this case , allowing for discreteness effects will again accelerate the growth of emittance , but the exact form of this enhanced growth can be more complex , even though it will again be subexponential .",
    "section iii will exhibit additional examples of how discreteness can accelerate emittance growth for both regular and chaotic clumps .",
    "the preceding indicates that , as @xmath0 increases , orbit ensembles evolved in frozen-@xmath0 backgrounds more closely resemble orbit ensembles with the same set of initial conditions evolved in the corresponding smooth potential .",
    "this does not , however , necessarily imply that individual orbits also converge towards characteristics in the smooth potential .",
    "to what extent , then , is it true that , as @xmath0 increases , individual trajectories come to more closely resemble smooth potential characteristics ? the most obvious  and compelling  check is visual : do frozen-@xmath0 orbits ` look like ' smooth potential characteristics when @xmath0 becomes sufficiently large ? as a simple , and extreme , example , consider a constant density spherical system without a central spike where , in the continuum limit , @xmath93 reduces to an isotropic harmonic oscillator potential ; and select an initial condition which , in the smooth potential , corresponds to a circular orbit .",
    "results derived from integrations of such an initial condition in different frozen-@xmath0 systems are exhibited in figure 5 , which shows representative frozen-@xmath0 orbits generated for particle number varying between @xmath81 and @xmath69 , along with the smooth potential orbit .",
    "for the four smallest values of @xmath0 , there is no obvious hint that the orbit ` should ' be circular or that there ` should ' be a net sense of circulation , although there _ is _ a crude visual sense that , as @xmath0 increases , the orbit becomes ` less tangled . '",
    "however , for @xmath68 one starts to discern a clear sense of net circulation , for @xmath94 the orbit has clearly become centrophobic ( thus suggesting that angular momentum is at least approximately conserved ) , and for @xmath69 the orbit arguably resembles a ` distorted ' or precessing circular orbit .",
    "as is illustrated in figure 6 , the visual impression that the orbit is becoming more nearly circular can be corroborated by constructing the fourier spectra of the orbital data .",
    "for the three smallest values of @xmath0 , the quantity @xmath95 is obviously broad band , although there is a peak at or near the circular frequency associated with the smooth potential orbit . for @xmath96 and @xmath76",
    "the peak becomes appreciably sharper , and for @xmath94 and @xmath82 one sees only slight irregularities in the spectra which translate into the visual appearance of precession .",
    "the conclusion is obvious : as @xmath0 increases , frozen-@xmath0 orbits come to more closely approximate the smooth orbit , both visually and in terms of their power spectrum .",
    "analogous results obtain for more generic initial conditions evolved in this and other integrable potentials .",
    "convergence of orbits in terms of their fourier spectra is important in justifying straightforward applications of nonlinear dynamics to many - body systems interacting via long range forces .",
    "many physical phenomena in many - body systems , including accelerator modes  @xcite , modulational diffusion  @xcite , and resonant relaxation  @xcite , are attributed to resonant couplings between , _",
    "e.g. , _ the natural frequencies of individual regular orbits and the frequency or frequencies associated with some perturbation .",
    "however , such applications can only be justified if the ` real ' @xmath0-body orbits have frequencies that adequately approximate the frequencies associated with characteristics in the smooth potential .",
    "the degree of irregularity exhibited by individual orbits can be quantified by computing fourier complexity , as defined in eq .",
    "the results of one such investigation are summarised by the curves with diamonds in figure 7 , which exhibit @xmath97 , the mean number of frequencies required to capture 95% of the total power , for collections of 100 initial conditions evolved in frozen-@xmath0 backgrounds with different @xmath0 .",
    "( the triangles will be discussed in the following subsection . ) in each case , the initial conditions were integrated for a time @xmath98 , with orbital data recorded at fixed intervals @xmath54 .",
    "the data were then fourier analysed using an _ fft _ solver to translate a set of @xmath99 points into a set of @xmath100 fourier amplitudes .",
    "the upper panel was generated for orbits in the integrable model 1 , the lower panel for the strongly chaotic model 2 . in each panel ,",
    "the solid curve represents the mean complexity computed in the unperturbed smooth potential .",
    "error bars were computed by dividing the 100 initial conditions in half and analysing each half separately .",
    "it is evident that , in both cases , @xmath97 is a decreasing function of @xmath0 which converges towards the continuum value for @xmath2 . for smaller values of @xmath0 ,",
    "the regular and chaotic ensembles have comparable complexities , although the regular ensemble is slightly less ( @xmath101 ) complex .",
    "however , for larger values of @xmath0 there are clear distinctions between the regular and chaotic ensembles , the chaotic ensembles for @xmath102 being nearly twice as complex as the regular ensembles .",
    "indeed , for other choice of regular models the complexity can be even lower : the fact that the smooth potential complexity in panel ( a ) is as large as it is reflects the fact that the regular orbits used to generate this figure were relatively complex ` box ' orbits , with the topology of lissajous figures , which , even in the continuum limit , require two or three frequencies in each direction to capture as much as 95% of the power .",
    "if instead @xmath97 is computed for an ensemble of initial conditions corresponding to circular orbits , the complexity converges towards a continuum limit with @xmath103 .",
    "conventional wisdom holds that discreteness effects can be idealised as friction and gaussian ( nearly ) white noise in the context of a fokker - planck description  @xcite .",
    "taken literally , this suggests that individual @xmath0-body orbits can be well - mimicked by langevin simulations .",
    "however , it is not completely clear to what extent this is really true .",
    "the original derivation of the fokker - planck equation ( and most if not all of its tests ) restricted attention to the statistical properties of orbit ensembles or distribution functions over comparatively long time scales , assuming implicitly that the bulk potential in which the particle evolves is nonchaotic .",
    "can the friction / noise paradigm describe correctly short time behaviour and/or the behaviour of individual orbits , especially in a chaotic potential ? granted the validity of a fokker - planck description , a simple rule connects @xmath0 to the strength of the friction and noise . assuming that the noise is characterised by a temperature per unit mass @xmath104 comparable to the magnitude of the particle energy , the coefficient of dynamical friction @xmath105 defines an energy relaxation time @xmath106 .",
    "however , an evaluation of the fokker - planck coefficients in a binary encounter approximation leads to the prediction that @xmath107 , with @xmath108 the coulomb logarithm .",
    "given the assumption of a nonneutral plasma , the treatment of @xmath6 must necessarily be somewhat heuristic  @xcite .",
    "however , there is a general agreement that @xmath6 should scale as some power of @xmath0 , so that @xmath3 , and hence the diffusion constant @xmath4 , should satisfy @xmath109 the obvious question , then , is whether frozen-@xmath0 simulations with specified @xmath0 can be well - mimicked by langevin simulations with @xmath110 .",
    "two practical issues arise in testing this prediction .",
    "the first is that , because of the limited range of @xmath0 that can be explored , it is impractical to test the subdominant @xmath111 dependence : for @xmath112 or so , the very notion of a bulk potential fails ; for @xmath113 computations become prohibitively expensive .",
    "one must instead restrict attention to testing the simpler scaling relation @xmath114 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath115 for some constant @xmath116 .",
    "the second point is more serious .",
    "the usual langevin equation reads  @xcite @xmath117 where @xmath118 represents a dynamical friction .",
    "@xmath119 represents gaussian white noise , which is characterised completely by its first two moments : @xmath120 and @xmath121 with @xmath122 the diffusion constant entering into a fokker - planck description . by choosing @xmath104 to equal",
    "the initial energy one can ensure that the average energy of the orbits remains unchanged .",
    "such an equation is clearly unsatisfactory here .",
    "energy is conserved absolutely for frozen-@xmath0 orbits , so that one must also impose energy conservation on any scheme which aims to mimic its effects .",
    "( for very small @xmath105 , energy remains almost conserved for very long times",
    ". however , comparatively small @xmath0 should correspond to relatively large @xmath105 , which implies large changes in energy and , as such , significant changes in the phase space regions accessible to the noisy orbit . ) for this reason , the noisy integrations described here were performed using a modified energy - conserving noise  @xcite .",
    "this entailed ( 1 ) eliminating the dynamical friction altogether , ( 2 ) again imparting random kicks as in eq .  ( 17 ) , but ( 3 ) renormalising the modified velocity at each time step by an overall factor , _",
    "@xmath123 , with @xmath124 so chosen that @xmath125 .",
    "modulo this complication , the noise was integrated using a standard algorithm  @xcite based on a fourth order runge - kutta integration scheme with fixed time step @xmath126 .",
    "the integrations were performed for @xmath127 , it having been confirmed that the statistical effects of the noise were insensitive to the precise value of @xmath126 for @xmath128 .    at the level of orbit ensembles , as probed by the emittance and other bulk moments , the results of frozen-@xmath0 simulations are in fact extremely well - mimicked by langevin simulations , at least for comparatively large @xmath0 .",
    "the degree to which this is true can be inferred by contrasting the right and left hand columns of figures 3 and 4 . as discussed already , the left hand columns of figures 3 and 4 exhibit , respectively , time - dependent emittances for models 1 and 2 , allowing for several different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the right hand panels exhibit data generated from langevin integrations of the same initial conditions , allowing for amplitudes @xmath105 satisfying eq .",
    "( 15 ) with @xmath129 , so that , _ e.g. , _ @xmath69 corresponds to @xmath130 . for the smallest values of @xmath0 ( and hence the largest values of @xmath105 )  corresponding to panels ( a ) and ( b ) in figure 3 and panels ( a ) - ( d ) in figure 4 , the agreement is not all that good .",
    "however , for larger particle number ",
    "@xmath78 for the regular system and @xmath131 for the chaotic system  , the agreement is obviously quite good .",
    "the bottom right hand panel in fig .  4 was generated for orbits evolved with a considerably smaller value of @xmath105 , namely @xmath132 , this corresponding to the largest noise amplitude that does _ not _ alter appreciably the emittance growth observed in the smooth potential . to the extent that the scaling of eq .",
    "( 15 ) is in fact correct for @xmath133 , the fact that larger values of @xmath105 have an appreciable effect on emittance growth implies that , even over an interval as short as @xmath66 , corresponding to @xmath134 orbital time scales @xmath7 , one requires @xmath135 to justify a continuum limit ! _ even though the collisional relaxation time scale @xmath136 , discreteness effects can be important in a system with @xmath137 on a time scale as short as @xmath138 . _",
    "as is evident from figure 7 , this agreement also extends to the level of individual orbits .",
    "as described already , the diamond curves in this figure were derived from frozen-@xmath0 integrations .",
    "the other curves , constituted of triangles , were generated from exactly the same initial conditions , now integrated , however , in the smooth potential while being subjected to energy - conserving gaussian noise with @xmath139 and variable @xmath105 .",
    "to the extent that conventional fokker - planck theory is correct , one would anticipate a correspondence between @xmath0 and @xmath105 of the form given by eq .",
    "the noisy points in figure 7 were in fact identified with the frozen-@xmath0 points assuming the validity of the scaling ( 15 ) with @xmath140 . the obvious fact ,",
    "then , is that , given this identification , the curves @xmath141 and @xmath142 rather nearly coincide . _ even at the level of the complexity of individual orbits , frozen-@xmath0 orbits can be well - mimicked by noisy orbits with _",
    "@xmath143 const .",
    "granted that discreteness effects can be mimicked by gaussian white noise , the scaling relations ( 11 ) and ( 13 ) are easily understood . at least for a harmonic potential ,",
    "it is straightforward to derive analytic solutions to the langevin equation ( 16 ) for moments like @xmath144 or @xmath145  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it is easily seen that the fokker - planck equation associated with eq .",
    "( 16 ) implies that the clump emittance satisfies @xmath146 assuming , however , that the initial emittance is extremely small , at early times one can approximate that @xmath147 ; and , to the extent that the growth time is long compared with the characteristic crossing time , one can average over oscillations to set @xmath148 , with @xmath149 the initial energy .",
    "it then follows that , for early times , @xmath150 combining eq .",
    "( 19 ) and the analogous formulae for @xmath151 and @xmath152 with the scaling relation @xmath153 leads immediately to eq .  ( 11 ) .",
    "the same diffusive @xmath154 behaviour also arises for @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "a somewhat more heuristic argument can account for the scaling ( 13 ) associated with a chaotic potential .",
    "if the initial emittance @xmath157 , it is clear that , in the absence of discreteness effects , @xmath72 would continue to vanish identically : two smooth integrations of the same initial condition will not yield divergent orbits , even if the orbits are chaotic .",
    "however , discreteness effects act to ` kick ' two nearly coincident orbits apart , at which point they will tend to diverge at a rate set by the lyapunov exponent @xmath9 associated with the bulk potential . assuming , however , that the ` kicks ' are random , their effects will scale as @xmath158 rather than @xmath105 ; but combining this with eq .",
    "( 15 ) implies that  @xcite @xmath159 eq .",
    "( 13 ) follows since @xmath71 scales as @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "consider now a more realistic example , the thermal equilibrium model  @xcite , which , in the continuum limit , admits large measures of both regular and chaotic orbits  @xcite .",

    "chaotic orbits are far more susceptible to low amplitude noise than are regular orbits . _ presuming again that the scaling relation ( 15 ) holds , this implies that _ for the case of chaotic orbit ensembles , the continuum limit can not be justified for @xmath202 .",

    "iii a. accordingly , in studying the dynamics of beams with moderate space charge , one may not be able to assume the validity of the continuum limit with complete confidence , even for a system in equilibrium",
    ". the situation may be even more problematic for a beam that is significantly out of equilibrium , since the resulting time - dependent potential would be expected to generate a larger population of chaotic orbits  @xcite .      at very low energies , where the total potential is nearly harmonic , all smooth potential orbits are regular , so that discreteness effects can only act to deflect frozen-@xmath0 orbits from one regular trajectory to another .",
    "however , at higher energies the smooth potential admits a complex coexistence of regular and chaotic orbits .",
    "this implies the possibility that discreteness effects can deflect frozen-@xmath0 orbits from regular to chaotic characteristics and vice versa  @xcite . of obvious interest",
    "then is how fast , as a function of @xmath0 , such transitions occur .",
    "for example , an accelerator designer relying on the vlasov equation and an analysis based on a smooth , macroscopic potential would neglect these microscopic transitions and their corresponding impact on chaotic mixing .",
    "thus the physics of collective relaxation and global emittance growth would be improperly modeled and the results , at least in principle , would be suspect .",
    "the consequences of such an omission depend on the problem at hand , but one might expect them to be especially severe for nonequilibrium beams where chaotic dynamics is likely to be more prevalent  @xcite .    if one selects a localised ensemble of initial conditions corresponding to regular orbits in the smooth potential and integrates these initial conditions into the future , discreteness effects will , if sufficiently strong , eventually trigger transitions from regularity to chaos .",
    "that such transitions actually occur can be determined by a visual inspection of individual frozen-@xmath0 orbits which can be observed to become abruptly ` more irregular ' in appearance .",
    "if , moreover , large numbers of transitions occur over very short times , this can make the emittance associated with an initially localised ensemble , which ought to grow as a power law in time , exhibit instead a more rapid , roughly exponential , increase .    however , an accurate determination of the relative fraction of the orbits which are still regular requires a more careful analysis .",
    "this was done by recording the phase space coordinates of individual frozen-@xmath0 orbits at various times @xmath203 , and evolving these into the future in the smooth potential to determine whether the resulting smooth potential characteristics were still regular or whether instead they had become chaotic .",
    "the most straightforward fashion in which to determine whether the orbits are chaotic would have been to compute an estimate of the largest ( finite time ) lyapunov exponent .",
    "given , however , that the potential can not be expressed in terms of elementary functions , this would have proven extremely expensive computationally .",
    "for that reason , distinctions between regularity and chaos were based instead on the computed _ complexities _ of the characteristics . as discussed elsewhere ( _ e.g. , _ @xcite , @xcite , and references cited therein )",
    ", such a criterion typically coincides almost exactly with more conventional criteria based on lyapunov exponents .",
    "presuming that the system is ergodic and that discreteness effects are sufficiently strong that they can in principle convert any orbit from regular to chaotic , and vice versa , it would seem clear what such an analysis ought to reveal .",
    "( 1 ) at sufficiently late times , independent of @xmath0 the relative fraction of chaotic orbits generated from any initial ensemble should ( to within statistical uncertainties ) coincide with the relative measure of chaotic orbits on the constant energy hypersurface , _",
    "i.e. , _ to the relative volume of the chaotic portions of the constant energy hypersurface .",
    "( 2 ) assuming , however , that discreteness effects are more important for smaller @xmath0 , the time required to converge towards this asymptotic value should be an increasing function of @xmath0 .",
    "as @xmath0 increases , transitions should become more rare .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "10 , which summarises computations with particle number between @xmath76 and @xmath204 , this expectation was in fact confirmed . for frozen-@xmath0 systems with number as small as @xmath68 ,",
    "nearly 40% of the orbits in an initially regular ensemble had become chaotic within a time @xmath205 , a time corresponding to only @xmath206 , and the relative measure @xmath207 of chaotic orbits appears to have asymptoted towards a time - independent value by @xmath66 .",
    "the relative measure of chaotic orbits for computations with @xmath94 grew more slowly in time ; but , by @xmath196 , the relative measure had again approached a value @xmath208 . for larger values of @xmath0",
    ", @xmath207 remains a monotonically increasing function of time , but transitions are sufficiently rare that one does not approach an equilibrium population within a time as short as @xmath209 .",
    "as @xmath0 increases , frozen-@xmath0 orbits come to more closely resemble smooth potential characteristics generated from the same initial condition , both visually and in terms of their fourier spectra .",
    "one might therefore expect that , at least for a regular , _",
    "nonchaotic , smooth potential , the value of the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath8 should decrease with increasing @xmath0 and converge towards zero for @xmath2 .",
    "such , however , is not the case .",
    "rather , as is also true for gravitationally interacting systems of particles  @xcite , for both regular and chaotic orbits the value of @xmath8 is comparatively insensitive to @xmath0 ; and there are even indications that @xmath8 might _ increase _ with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "figure 11 exhibits the value of the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath8 as a function of @xmath0 for a single initial condition evolved in frozen-@xmath0 integrations with softening parameters varying between @xmath42 and @xmath210 .",

    "each point was generated by integrating the same initial condition used to generate figures 5 and 6 for a total time @xmath212 in 10 different frozen-@xmath0 realisations of model 1 . in the continuum limit",
    "this initial condition corresponds to an integrable circular orbit with vanishing lyapunov exponents ; and , as was evident from figure 5 , the frozen-@xmath0 orbits for larger @xmath0 look much more regular in appearance than do the orbits with smaller @xmath0 . despite this , however , at least for the smallest values of @xmath211 , @xmath8 does not decrease with increasing @xmath0 . as probed by @xmath8 ,",
    "orbits with @xmath81 and @xmath44 are comparably chaotic !    however , for larger values of @xmath211 , @xmath8 _ does _ decrease with increasing @xmath0 . that this should be the case is easily understood . because the bulk potential is integrable , the chaos must at some level be associated with close encounters between nearby charges ; but introducing a softening parameter _ de facto _ ` turns off ' encounters on scales shorter than @xmath211 .",
    "if the charge density is sufficiently large that encounters with separation @xmath213 become common , the simulation will have artificially , and erroneously , reduced this source of chaos , yielding a smaller @xmath8 .    that the value of @xmath8 for nearly unsoftened frozen-@xmath0 integrations is insensitive to whether the smooth potential is regular or chaotic is illustrated in figure 13 , which exhibits @xmath8 as a function of @xmath0 for integrations with @xmath42 for the same initial condition integrated in both models 1 and 2 .",
    "that figure also emphasises another important point , namely that @xmath8 is typically larger than any lyapunov exponent @xmath9 associated with motion in the smooth potential by an order of magnitude or more . for this particular initial condition , @xmath214 whereas @xmath215 .    that @xmath8 should be insensitive to the choice of @xmath0 , at least for unsoftened simulations , might seem rather curious",
    "however , it is not hard to understand why this might be so for a @xmath1 force . given that the microchaos disappears completely in the continuum limit , it would seem clear that it must be associated with a sequence of ` random ' interactions between a ` test ' charge and a collection of ` field ' charges .",
    "however , this suggests that the lyapunov time @xmath216 associated with the growth of a small initial perturbation can be estimated by considering tidal effects associated with a pair of charges separated by a distance @xmath217 comparable to ( some fixed fraction of ) the typical interparticle separation @xmath218 .",
    "this tidal acceleration scales as @xmath219 with @xmath164 the magnitude of an individual charge . given , however , that @xmath220 , with @xmath221 the size of the system and @xmath170 a characteristic number density , and that @xmath222 , with @xmath223 the total charge , it follows that the time scale @xmath224 , and hence @xmath8 , should be independent of @xmath0 . as @xmath0 increases , the sizes of the individual charges and the cube of the typical interparticle separation both decrease as @xmath225 , so that the ratio is independent of particle number .",
    "a more careful argument  @xcite actually allows one to prove analytically that , in the absence of softening , @xmath8 can not decrease towards zero with increasing @xmath0 . for simple geometries , an analytic expression for the average value of the stability matrix entering into the definition of @xmath8",
    "can be formulated in terms of a @xmath226-dimensional integral .",
    "this integral can not be evaluated analytically , but one _ can _ derive rigorous bounds which ensure that the largest eigenvalue remains positive even for @xmath2 ; and , even more strikingly , monte carlo evaluations of the integrals suggests that @xmath8 should be a slowly _ increasing _ function of @xmath0 .",
    "in other words , viewed in terms of @xmath8 , orbits become more chaotic as @xmath0 increases , even though , for the case of a regular potential , they become more regular in appearance !",
    "@xcite    _ the obvious inference is that @xmath0-body lyapunov exponents @xmath8 do not provide a useful characterisation of the degree of chaos associated with an orbit , at least when that orbit is viewed macroscopically . _      that frozen-@xmath0 orbits have large positive lyapunov exponents @xmath8 , even for the case of an integrable potential , but that distinctions between regular and chaotic potentials are clearly manifested in the phase mixing of initially localised clumps would suggest that there are two different , and comparatively distinct , potential sources of chaos in the @xmath0-body problem .    on the one hand",
    ", one would expect _ microchaos _ , triggered by close encounters between individual charges , which is manifested only on very short scales , comparable to , or perhaps somewhat larger than , the typical interparticle spacing .",
    "this source of chaos should be generic to the @xmath0-body problem , irrespective of the form of the bulk potential , generating randomness qualitatively similar to what arises in pinball .",
    "on the other hand , there is also the possibility of larger scale _ macrochaos _ , which would be expected if and only if the bulk potential admits global stochasticity .",
    "if these expectations are in fact correct , two nearby initial conditions evolved in a frozen-@xmath0 realisation of any potential should diverge exponentially at a rate @xmath227 until their separation becomes somewhat larger than a typical interparticle spacing , at which point the microchaos would ` turn off . '",
    "if the bulk potential is regular , no other source of chaos could act and the two orbits would continue to diverge as a more modest power law . if , however , the bulk potential is chaotic , _ macrochaos _ would still act , resulting in a continued exponential divergence , albeit at a rate @xmath90 typically much smaller than @xmath8 . in this case , exponential divergence should be replaced by a power law divergence only once the separation has become macroscopic .",
    "this three - stage evolution for chaotic orbits is clearly illustrated in figure 14 , which exhibits data for frozen-@xmath0 simulations with @xmath94 , @xmath82 , and @xmath204 .",

    "figure 15 shows the analogue of figure 14 , now generated for regular initial conditions in the thermal equilibrium model .",
    "once again there is an initial exponential growth at a rate comparable to @xmath8 , but in this case there is no evidence of a second exponential phase .",
    "rather , the initial exponential phase is followed immediately by an interval of power law divergence .",
    "one other point , not obvious from these figures , is that the scaling with @xmath0 observed for the final power law phase is different for the regular and chaotic systems .",
    "for regular orbits , the phase space separation @xmath232 , like @xmath235 and @xmath237 , satisfies a linear growth law @xmath238 with @xmath239 for chaotic orbits , one finds that @xmath232 again grows linearly in time , but that the growth time @xmath240      the standard definition of lyapunov exponents implies that they probe the average rate of divergence for two nearby chaotic orbits in a single system .",

    "_    this means that lyapunov exponents also provide information about the degree to which characteristics generated in the smooth potential can be interpreted as providing a pointwise approximation to real frozen-@xmath0 orbits with the same initial condition , as well as the degree to which orbits in two different frozen-@xmath0 systems remain close to one another in a pointwise sense .",
    "this is important at a practical level . in a real experiment",
    "one may perhaps be able to ensure that a given @xmath0-body system constitutes ( nearly ) a fair sampling of some specified density distribution , but the details of the actual @xmath0-body distribution are likely inaccessible .",
    "of obvious interest , therefore , are the questions : to what extent will orbits in two different @xmath0-body systems coincide ? and to what extent do such orbits coincide with characteristics in the bulk potential associated with the smooth density distribution ?",
    "figure 16 exhibits the analogue of figure 14 , now generated by comparing the same 50 initial conditions evolved in two different frozen-@xmath0 systems .",
    "figure 17 compares orbits in a frozen-@xmath0 system with orbits in the smooth potential . in each case , the duration of the initial interval of especially fast exponential divergence is significantly reduced , but the second interval with divergence at a rate @xmath90 is still conspicuous .",

    "viewed macroscopically , there is a precise sense in which , as @xmath0 increases , trajectories in frozen-@xmath0 systems converge towards characteristics in the corresponding smooth potential . for very small particle number , @xmath242 or so , the notion of an average bulk potential fails and orbits in frozen-@xmath0 systems are very different from smooth potential characteristics . in particular , the usual distinctions between regularity and chaos that exist in a smooth potential seem completely lost .",
    "@xcite however , for larger @xmath0 one begins to observe clear distinctions between orbits evolved from initial conditions which , in the continuum limit , correspond to regular versus chaotic orbits .",

    "there is presumably a maximum time over which it is safe to ignore these transitions .",
    "the critical point , then , as is evident from fig .",

    "the meaning of ` chaos ' in the @xmath0-body problem is necessarily somewhat subtle .",

    "short range _ microchaos _ , associated with close encounters between individual charges , is a generic feature of the @xmath0-body problem , independent of the form of the bulk potential .",
    "however , there is also the possibility of larger scale _ macrochaos _ which arises if and only if , in the continuum limit , the bulk potential admits chaos . the important point , then , is that these two distinct sources of chaos can be characterised separately by different sets of lyapunov exponents .",

    "it is possible to extract estimates of both @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "finally , it should be noted that , as applied to the @xmath0-body problem , the smooth potential lyapunov exponent @xmath9 does not simply quantify the average divergence of two nearby trajectories in a single frozen-@xmath0 simulation .",
    "it also quantifies the rate at which a frozen-@xmath0 trajectory will diverge from a smooth potential characteristic with the same initial condition and the rate at which orbits with the same initial condition diverge in different frozen-@xmath0 simulations , two quantities which , in some settings , could be even more important physically .",

    "<S> this paper summarises an investigation of discreteness effects and the continuum limit for time - independent , nearly collisionless @xmath0-body systems of charged particles interacting via an unscreened @xmath1 force , allowing for bulk density distributions corresponding to potentials that admit both regular and chaotic orbits . both for orbit ensembles and for individual orbits , for @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> there is a smooth convergence towards a continuum limit . </S>",
    "<S> at least for moderately large values of @xmath0 discreteness effects are extremely well modeled by gaussian white noise with energy relaxation time @xmath3 , and hence diffusion constant @xmath4 , consistent with the scaling @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the coulomb logarithm and @xmath7 a natural ` dynamical ' time scale , as predicted by a fokker - planck description . </S>",
    "<S> discreteness effects accelerate emittance growth for an initially localised ensemble of orbits ( ` clump ' ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , even allowing for discreteness effects one can distinguish clearly between orbits which , in the continuum limit , feel a regular ( nonchaotic ) potential , so that emittance grows as a power law in time , and chaotic orbits , for which the emittance grows exponentially . for sufficiently large @xmath0 , one can implement a clear distinction between two different ` kinds ' of chaos acting in @xmath0-body systems . </S>",
    "<S> short range _ microchaos _ , associated with close encounters between individual charges , is a generic feature of the @xmath0-body problem , giving rise to _ large positive lyapunov exponents @xmath8 which do not decrease with increasing @xmath0 even if the bulk potential is integrable . </S>",
    "<S> _ alternatively , there is the possibility of larger scale _ macrochaos _ , characterised typically by somewhat smaller lyapunov exponents @xmath9 , which will be present only if the bulk potential admits global stochasticity . </S>",
    "<S> conventional computations of the largest lyapunov exponent provide estimates of @xmath8 , leading to the oxymoronic conclusion that @xmath0-body orbits which look nearly regular and have sharply peaked fourier spectra are ` very chaotic . ' </S>",
    "<S> however , the ` range ' of the microchaos is set by the typical interparticle spacing which , as @xmath0 increases , becomes progressively smaller , so that , for sufficiently large @xmath0 , this microchaos , albeit very strong , is largely irrelevant macroscopically . </S>",
    "<S> a more careful numerical analysis allows one to derive estimates of both @xmath8 and @xmath9 . </S>"
