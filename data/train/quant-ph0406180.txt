    "quantum complexity theory has emerged alongside the first efficient quantum algorithms in an attempt to formalize the notion of an _ efficient _ algorithm . in analogy to classical complexity theory , several new quantum complexity classes have appeared .",
    "a major challenge today consists in understanding their structure and the interrelation between classical and quantum classes .",
    "one of the most important classical complexity classes is @xmath2 - nondeterministic polynomial time .",
    "this class comprises languages that can be _ verified _ in polynomial time by a deterministic verifier .",
    "the celebrated cook - levin theorem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) shows that this class has _",
    "complete _ problems .",
    "more formally , it states that sat is @xmath2-complete , i.e. , it is in @xmath2 and any other language in @xmath2 can be reduced to it with polynomial overhead . in",
    "sat we are given a set of clauses ( disjunctions ) over @xmath5 variables and asked whether there is an assignment that satisfies all clauses .",
    "one can consider the restriction of sat in which each clause consists of at most @xmath0 literals .",
    "this is known as the @xmath0-sat problem .",
    "it is known that 3-sat is still @xmath2-complete while 2-sat is in  , i.e. , has a polynomial time solution .",
    "we can also consider the max-@xmath0-sat problem : here , given a @xmath0-sat formula and a number @xmath6 we are asked whether there exists an assignment that satisfies at least @xmath6 clauses .",
    "it turns out that max-2-sat is already @xmath2-complete ; max-1-sat is clearly in .",
    "the class @xmath1 is the quantum analogue of @xmath2 in a probabilistic setting , i.e. , the class of all languages that can be probabilistically verified by a quantum verifier in polynomial time ( the name is derived from the classical class @xmath7 , which is the randomized analogue of @xmath2 ) .",
    "this class , which is also called @xmath8 , was first studied in @xcite ; the name @xmath1 was given to it by watrous @xcite .",
    "several problems in @xmath1 have been identified @xcite . for a good introduction to the class @xmath1 ,",
    "see the book by kitaev et al . @xcite and the paper by watrous @xcite .",
    "kitaev , inspired by ideas due to feynman , defined the quantum analogue of the classical sat problem , the local hamiltonian problem @xcite .",
    "an instance of @xmath0- can be viewed as a set of local constraints on @xmath5 qubits , each involving at most @xmath0 of them .",
    "we are asked whether there is a state of the @xmath5 qubits such that the expected number of violated constraints is either below a certain threshold or above another , with a promise that one of the two cases holds and both thresholds are at least a constant apart .",
    "more formally , we are to determine whether the _ groundstate _ energy of a given @xmath0-local hamiltonian is below one threshold or above another .",
    "kitaev proved @xcite that the 5- problem is @xmath1-complete .",
    "later , kempe and regev showed that already 3- is complete for @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is easy to see that 1- is in . the complexity of the 2- problem was left as an open question in @xcite .",
    "it is not hard to see that the @xmath0- problem contains the max - k - sat problem as a special case .",
    "variables by @xmath5 qubits and represent each clause by a hamiltonian .",
    "each hamiltonian is diagonal and acts on the @xmath0 variables that appear in its clause .",
    "it ` penalizes ' the assignment that violates the clause by increasing its eigenvalue .",
    "therefore , the lowest eigenvalue of the sum of the hamiltonians corresponds to the maximum number of clauses that can be satisfied simultaneously .",
    "] using the known @xmath2-completeness of max-2-sat , we obtain that 2- is @xmath2-hard , i.e. , any problem in @xmath2 can be reduced to it with polynomial overhead .",
    "but is it also @xmath1-complete ?",
    "or perhaps it lies in some intermediate class between @xmath2 and @xmath1 ?",
    "some special cases of the problem were considered by bravyi and vyalyi @xcite ; however , the question still remained open .    in this paper",
    "we settle the question of the complexity of 2- and show    [ thm : main_thm ] the 2- problem is @xmath1-complete .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the @xmath0- problem is in @xmath1 for any constant @xmath0 ( and in fact even for @xmath9 where @xmath5 is the total number of qubits ) .",
    "hence , our task in this paper is to show that any problem in @xmath1 can be reduced to the 2- problem with a polynomial overhead .",
    "we give two self - contained proofs for this .",
    "our first proof is based on a careful selection of gates in a quantum circuit and several applications of a lemma called the _ projection lemma_. the proof is quite involved ; however , it uses only elementary linear algebra and hence might appeal to some readers .",
    "our second proof is based on perturbation theory  a collection of techniques that are used to analyze sums of hamiltonians .",
    "this proof is more mathematically involved .",
    "nevertheless , it might give more intuition as to why the 2- problem is @xmath1-complete .",
    "unlike the first proof which shows how to represent any @xmath1 circuit by a 2-local hamiltonian , the second proof shows a reduction from the 3- problem ( which is already known to be @xmath1-complete @xcite ) to the 2- problem . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first reduction _ inside _",
    "@xmath1 ( i.e. , not from the circuit problem ) .",

    "similarly , they show that the model of adiabatic computation with @xmath11-local hamiltonians between nearest neighbor qubits on a @xmath11-dimensional grid is equivalent to standard quantum computation .",
