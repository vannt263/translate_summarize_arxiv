    "the gamma - ray emission of lgrbs and show almost no similarities apart for being detected by the same instruments .",
    "lgrbs are luminous ( @xmath2 erg / s ) , hard ( @xmath3 kev ) , highly variable and narrowly collimated with a typical duration of 10 - 100 s ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "are fainter by about four orders of magnitude ( @xmath4 erg / s ) , relatively soft ( @xmath5 kev ) , not highly beamed and show no significant temporal variability over their entire duration , which is often longer than 1000 s @xcite .    to date",
    "there are only four well observed , erg / s for which an associated sne was observed - llgrb / sn : 980425/1998bw , 031203/2003lw , 060218/2006aj and 100316d/2010bh . ] compared to hundreds of lgrbs . however , this is a result of their low luminosity , which limits the detection to a distance of @xmath6 mpc , compared to lgrbs which are seen through the entire universe .",
    "in fact , are much more common than lgrbs , and are the most abundant known relativistic explosions in the nearby universe @xcite .",
    "thus , are of special interest , both for the understanding of grbs and their connection to sne , and as sources of high energy non - electromagnetic signals , such as gravitational - waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , neutrinos ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and cosmic - rays(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    based on high energy emission alone there is no reason to assume that lgrbs and are related",
    "moreover , theoretical considerations show that the gamma - rays seen in can not be produced in the same environment where the gamma - rays in lgrbs are generated @xcite .",
    "it is therefore puzzling that these two apparently different grb types are both associated with very similar peculiar sne of the rare broad - line ic type ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these sne show no signs of h or he in their spectra , an indication of highly stripped progenitors .",
    "their ejecta have unusually high velocities for sne ( 10,000@xmath730,000 km / s ) , their peak luminosities indicate a relatively large amount of synthesized @xmath8ni , and the total kinetic energy carried by some of these sne is unusually high ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the similarity of the associated sne suggests that and lgrbs have similar progenitors and similar inner explosion mechanism .",
    "the natural question that arises is how similar explosions produce such different gamma - ray signals .",
    "here we approach this puzzle by analyzing the early ( first day ) optical / uv light curve of sn 2006aj , which is associated with 060218 , in order to study its progenitor structure .",
    "060218/sn 2006aj has the best early observational coverage out of the four well observed and their associated sne .",
    "it includes swift continuous gamma - ray , x - ray , uv and optical observations ranging from @xmath9 s after the explosion @xcite , many optical spectra starting less than two days after the explosion @xcite and radio observations starting a day after the explosion @xcite .",
    "in fact sn 2006aj has probably the most detailed early optical / uv photometric coverage out of the thousands sne observed to date .",
    "the unique feature of the optical / uv light curve of sn 2006aj is that it shows two peaks . using a recently developed method for the analysis of double - peaked sne",
    "@xcite we constrain the progenitor properties .",
    "these properties are then used to learn about the physics of and on their relation to lgrbs .",
    "the paper structure is as follows .",
    "[ sec : progenitor ] presents the analysis of the optical / uv light curve and the resulting constraints on the progenitor structure of 060218/sn 2006aj .",
    "these constraints strongly support the suggestion that are generated by shock breakouts (  [ sec : breakout ] ) .",
    "a unified picture for and lgrbs that naturally explain the similarities and differences between them is presented in  [ sec : unified ] .",
    "this picture provides a simple explanation to the unique velocity profile of sne associated with _ ll_grb (  [ sec : velocity ] ) .",
    "the implication of this picture for  neutrino and gravitational wave emission is discussed in  [ sec : nonthermal ] .",
    "figure [ fig : uvot_lc ] depicts the optical / uv light curve of sn 2006aj as taken from @xcite .",
    "it shows two peaks in the optical bands , at @xmath10 hr and @xmath11 days , where @xmath12 is time since first detection of the gamma - rays , estimated here as the explosion time .",
    "such double - peaked light curves are very rare among sne . in typical sne",
    "the light curve is dominated by one of two power sources : ( i ) the internal energy deposited by the sn shock , known as  cooling envelope emission \" , or ( ii ) the radioactive decay of @xmath8ni .",
    "each one of these power sources produces only a single peak in the optical and , in typical sne , the time scales of the maximal contribution to the optical light from each of the two sources are comparable .",
    "therefore , observed sn light curves usually contain only a single optical peak which is powered by the stronger power source at any given sne .",
    "this is cooling envelope in explosions of red supergiants , such as type ii - p sne , and @xmath8ni in explosions of more compact progenitors , such as type i and 1987-like sne .",
    "two peaks are observed in rare cases where at early time the emission is powered by the cooling envelope , which then decays sharply on a time scale comparable to that of the rising @xmath8ni contribution .",
    "this behavior requires an atypical progenitor structure of a compact massive core that is engulfed by extended low - mass material @xcite .",
    "the second peak in these cases is similar to the main peak of a typical @xmath8ni powered sne , and thus its properties provide an estimate of the total ejecta mass and of the @xmath8ni mass . in the case of sn",
    "2006aj the second peak is clearly powered by @xmath8ni and it shows a total ejecta mass of @xmath13 , out of which @xmath14 are @xmath8ni @xcite .",
    "the only natural source of the first peak in sn 2006aj is the cooling envelope phase of an extended mass ( see appendix [ app : firstpeak ] ) and thus its properties can provide a robust estimate of the radius and the mass of the extended material . here the results of @xcite are used to derive these constraints .",
    "( assuming a galactic reddening curve with @xmath15 ) , and a host galaxy reddening @xmath16 ( assuming a small magellanic cloud reddening curve ) . ]",
    "the mass of the extended material can be estimated from the time of the first peak , @xmath17 @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the light speed and @xmath20 is the velocity to which the extended material is accelerated by the explosion .",
    "spectroscopic observations limit @xmath21 c , the measured photospheric velocity at @xmath22 day @xcite . on the high end",
    "it is most likely that @xmath23 c , since at higher velocity the kinetic energy carried by @xmath24 would be larger than the kinetic energy deposited by the explosion in the massive core ( @xmath25 erg ; @xcite ) .",
    "the pre - explosion radius of the extended material , @xmath26 , can be estimated by the bolometric luminosity at the first peak .",
    "the colors before and during the first peak are very blue and they are constant in time @xcite , as expected if the observed bands are on the rayleigh - jeans part of a blackbody spectrum during that time ( i.e. , with temperature @xmath27 k ; see consistency check below ) .",
    "this implies that the total luminosity seen in uv during the peak , @xmath28 erg , is only a lower limit on the true bolometric luminosity , which may be significantly higher .",
    "since @xmath26 is linear in the bolometric luminosity @xcite , the available observations set a lower limit : @xmath29 this is consistent with the lack of color evolution at @xmath30 and the model prediction that temperature is dropping with time , reaching at the peak @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "thus , the optical / uv light curve of sn 2006aj indicates that its progenitor had a relatively compact core of several solar masses , surrounded by @xmath32 which is extended to a radius of a supergiant .",
    "this structure is very different than the typically expected structure of a fully h stripped progenitor , based on stellar evolution models , yet it must be very common in grb progenitors given that are more common than lgrbs .",
    "this progenitor structure has several far reaching implications for the physics of and their associated sne , which are discussed in the following sections .",
    "the thomson optical depth of the extended material is high , @xmath33 . as a result , the breakout of the shock driven by the explosion takes place at @xmath26 .",
    "radio observations show that the leading edge of the outflow is mildly relativistic @xcite , implying that the breakout must be at least at a mildly relativistic velocity , i.e. , @xmath34 c. since rate considerations indicate that the gamma - rays in are not strongly beamed @xcite and late sn spectroscopy and polarimetry show no signs of ejecta a - sphericity @xcite , the breakout is not expect to strongly deviate from a spherical symmetry . in that case the main characteristics of a mildly relativistic shock breakout signal , its luminosity , duration and typical photon energy , depend only on the breakout radius @xcite : @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 this is similar to the actual gamma - ray signal of 060218 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 s and @xmath40 kev @xcite and it fits very well to a breakout radius @xmath41 cm .",
    "thus , the combination of optical / uv and radio observations imply that a shock breakout signal is inevitable and that its properties are similar to the observed .",
    "as shock breakout also explains a large range of properties of the high energy emission from ( e.g. , smooth profile , spectral evolution , low beaming ; @xcite ) , this result practically implies that the entire gamma - ray signal in 060218 is generated by a mildly relativistic shock breakout , without any significant contribution from a relativistic jet .",
    "it also lends a very strong support for the suggestion that all are shock breakouts @xcite .",
    "if all progenitors have a similar structure to that of 060218 then it provides a natural solution to the puzzle why two explosions with similar inner workings produce such different gamma - ray signals .",
    "according to the standard model for lgrbs the burst is powered by a central engine that launches a highly collimated ultra - relativistic bipolar jet . in order to produce a lgrb",
    "the jet must first punch its way through the star and then expand freely at ultra - relativistic velocities to radii where generated gamma - rays can be seen by the observer . while the jet drills through the dense stellar matter its energy is dissipated and the engine must continue to supply power into the jet if it is to succeed punching through the star and produce the observed lgrb @xcite .",
    "thus , a necessary condition for the production of a lgrb is that the engine working time is long enough to allow the jet to drill through the star .",
    "observations indicate that a typical lgrb engine launches a jet at a typical isotropic equivalent luminosity of @xmath42 erg / s and a typical opening angle @xmath43 over a typical duration of @xmath44 s @xcite . the total energy carried by the jet , after correction for beaming , is @xmath25 erg . if the progenitor is a bare h stripped star of several solar masses and several solar radii it takes @xmath45 s for the jet to penetrate through the star ( see appendix [ app : jets ] ; @xcite ) , implying that the jet can successfully emerge from the star and that the collapse of such a progenitor can lead to a lgrb .        the picture",
    ", however , is very different if there is an additional extended envelope surrounding the massive core , similar to the one found here for 060218 .",
    "although the extended material mass is low its large radius makes it very hard for a jet to penetrate .",
    "in fact the time that the engine must work in order for the jet to drill through the entire extended mass is ( appendix [ app : jets ] ) : @xmath46 this time is considerably longer than the typical working time of a lgrb engine .",
    "thus , a collapse of the progenitor of 060218 and the formation of a lgrb engine at its center will not lead to an observed lgrb .",
    "instead , the launched jet , which penetrates the stellar core , is choked while still propagating in the extended material . the energy carried by the jet ( @xmath47 erg )",
    "is then deposited in the extended mass accelerating it to high velocity ( @xmath48^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left[\\frac{m_{ext}}{10^{-2 } m_\\odot}\\right]^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } $ ] ) and driving into it a strong shock .",
    "the shock accelerates further at the dropping density gradient near @xmath26 and upon breakout produces a .",
    "note that while the energy deposition is done by a narrow jet and is therefore highly aspherical , the shock upon breakout can be quasi - spherical .",
    "the reason is that the jet is choked long before it approaches @xmath26 and the resulting blast wave becomes much more spherical during its propagation before it breaks out at @xmath26 .",
    "a schematic sketch of the similarities and differences between and lgrbs according this picture is illustrated in figure [ fig : sketch ] .",
    "this scenario resolves yet another puzzle related to sne associated with  why is the kinetic energy in their fast moving ejecta is so high compared to other sne @xcite . in typical",
    "sne the explosion energy is all deposited at the center of the progenitor .",
    "this drives a shock that crosses first the bulk of the mass and then accelerates at the sharp density drop near the stellar edge .",
    "this acceleration dictates a certain relation between the kinetic energy carried by slow and by fast moving material , where @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "this relation is seen in regular sne , but not in where the fast moving ejecta carries much more energy than it predicts @xcite .",
    "for example , in sn 2006aj about @xmath50 erg are carried by the bulk of the mass at @xmath51 km / s @xcite . in a regular sne if a mildly relativistic ( @xmath52 km / s ) ejecta exist , the relation @xmath53 dictates that it should carry @xmath54 erg . instead , in sn",
    "2006aj radio observations indicate that the mildly relativistic material carries @xmath55 erg @xcite .",
    "this observed property of sn 2006aj is naturally explained by the picture of presented here . in this picture the energy in the slow moving material is deposited by the sn explosion mechanism at the center , while the observed @xmath56 erg in the fast moving material is deposited directly by a grb jet , thereby decoupling the amount of energy carried by each of the components .",
    "an intriguing implication of the arising picture is the prospects for future detection of non - electromagnetic signal from .",
    "the extreme energies and velocities involved in lgrb engines and jets make them a potential source of gravitational waves ( gw ) , neutrinos and high - energy cosmic rays .",
    "however lgrbs are very rare in the local universe and are typically seen at a distance @xmath57gpc . here",
    "we suggest that harbor the same engine as lgrbs , which produces similar ultra - relativistic jets .",
    "the propagation of an jet is similar to that of a lgrb jet within the massive core .",
    "after the jet breaks out of the core and into the extended envelope the envelope density is low , so the pressure in the cocoon does not affect the jet ( see appendix [ app : jets ] ) .",
    "thus , at any location that is far from the jet head the jet is unaware of the extended envelope .",
    "therefore , all the physical processes that take place during the formation of the engine , the launching of the jet and the jet propagation in lgrb also take place in up to the radius where jets are choked in their progenitors extended envelopes , namely @xmath58 cm .",
    "thus , the same emission generated by a lgrb engine and by its jet while it propagates up to a radius of @xmath58 cm are expected to be generated also by a .",
    "this includes photons , high energy particles ( cosmic - rays ) , neutrinos and gws .",
    "the extended envelope has a thompson optical depth @xmath59 and therefore photons and cosmic - rays can not escape through the extended envelope ( the cross - section for @xmath60 inelastic collision at @xmath61 tev energies is @xmath62 thomson ) .",
    "however , the envelope is transparent to neutrinos and gws .",
    "it is therefore worth considering the implications of the model presented here for neutrino and gw emission from , especially given that are more common than lgrbs .",
    "lgrbs are expected to be bright sources of high energy neutrinos ( @xmath63 ev ) .",
    "the most promising production site of neutrinos is internal shocks within the relativistic jet @xcite . at radii that are large enough @xmath64",
    "cm these shocks are collisionless and are therefore expected to efficiently accelerate protons ( at smaller radii the shocks are radiation mediated and no efficient particle acceleration is expected ; @xcite ) . at radii that are small enough , @xmath65 , the photon density is high enough to allow an efficient photo - pion production and thus a generation of high energy neutrinos .",
    "current measurements limit the neutrino flux from lgrbs to @xmath66 per flavor , where @xmath67 tev @xcite .",
    "this upper limit is comparable to recent estimates of the flux expected from lgrbs if particles are accelerated efficiently in internal shocks at radii of @xmath68 cm @xcite and it is about two order of magnitude lower than the measured diffuse neutrino flux @xcite .    in the picture presented here",
    "are expected to be a much stronger source of diffuse neutrino flux than lgrbs .",
    "first are more numerous .",
    "the local rate of , without correction for beaming , is @xmath69 , where beaming correction is expected to be relatively small , @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "this is compared to a lgrb local rate , uncorrected for beaming , of @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "beaming correction increases the true rate of lgrbs by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "thus , are more frequent than lgrbs by about an order of magnitude .",
    "second , the neutrino production of lgrbs depends on the fraction of high - energy protons that produce pions via interaction with the observed gamma - rays .",
    "this fraction , denoted as @xmath72 , depends strongly on the burst parameters and it vary between bursts . under optimal conditions the estimates are @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "in however , the jet is buried in an envelope that is optically thick to high - energy protons .",
    "thus , energy of protons that in lgrbs would have been released to the host galaxy as cosmic - rays is converted in large part to neutrinos via @xmath60 interactions .",
    "thus , assuming that a large fraction of the lgrbs neutrinos are generated at radii smaller than @xmath74 cm , are more efficient in producing @xmath75 tev neutrinos by about two orders of magnitude , and possibly more ( this is the product of the to lgrb rate ratio and @xmath76 ) .",
    "as high - energy protons are accelerate within the ultra - relativistic narrowly collimated jets , the neutrino signal is narrowly beamed as well . since the gamma - ray emission from is not highly beamed ,",
    "most of observed bursts are not expected to be accompanied by a neutrino signal .",
    "thus , will contribute to the diffuse flux but they are not suitable for a targeted point - sources search , similar to the search conducted for lgrbs @xcite .",
    "can be then the main source of the observed diffuse flux ?",
    "@xcite find that the sources of the diffuse neutrino flux produce a total energy output of @xmath77 in @xmath6 tev neutrinos and their volumetric rate , assuming transient sources , must be @xmath78 ( as inferred from the lack of neutrino clustering ) . assuming that each harbor a relativistic jet with a typical energy of @xmath79 erg the total energy output in such jets is @xmath80 .",
    "thus , if @xmath81 of this energy is converted to high - energy protons before the jet is choked ( i.e. , at radii @xmath82 cm ) then are producing the observed diffuse flux . assuming that the typical jet angle is @xmath83 the rate of for which the neutrino beam is pointed towards earth is @xmath84 consistent with the limit derived by @xcite",
    "thus , are certainly viable candidates for the origin of the observed extra - galactic neutrino flux !",
    "finally , if harbor the same engine and relativistic jets as lgrbs then they produce the same gw signals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a difference is that while lgrbs are always observed close to the jet axis , the line - of - sight to is typically away from that axis .",
    "the gw signal from the engine can be slightly stronger along the jet axis ( up to a factor of 1.6 compared to an average line - of - sight observer ) , if its origin is quadrupole mass inhomogeneity in a rotating disk @xcite .",
    "other axisymmetric gw sources in the engine , such as mass motions and neutrino emission , vanish along the axis and are strong at the equator @xcite .",
    "the signal from the jet acceleration is also anti - beamed and is strongest along the equator @xcite .",
    "thus , the off - axis viewing angle of typical is probably an advantage for gw detection .",
    "the main advantage of is their much higher rate .",
    "the volumetric rate of is larger by about an order of magnitude than that of all lgrbs , including those that are unobservable since their gamma - ray beam points away from the earth .",
    "if only lgrbs that points towards earth are considered then the rate is higher by almost three order of magnitude .",
    "this is important since targeted gw search for grbs ( e.g. , following a detection of gamma - rays ) is more sensitive than a blind search , increasing the detection volume by a factor of @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "the various predicted gw signals from the engine and the jet are expected to be detectable by future gravitational wave detectors up to a distance of @xmath6 mpc .",
    "the rate of lgrbs at that distance is too low to allow a reasonable probability for detection .",
    "however , about one take place every year within a distance of 100 mpc , making it a promising gw source for future detectors .",
    "this paper analyzes the first day optical / uv light curve of sn 2006aj/060218 finding that its progenitor has a compact core engulfed by an extended low - mass material .",
    "when the information on this structure is combined with the high velocities inferred from the radio emitting material , it implies that the shock breakout form the extended material must produce a gamma - ray signal that is consistent with the observed gamma - ray emission .",
    "this indicates that the gamma - rays in 2006aj/060218 are generated by a mildly relativistic shock breakout and it strongly supports the suggestion that the origin of all  high energy emission is a shock breakout .",
    "these results , which are directly based on the observations of sn 2006aj , naturally suggest a picture that unifies lgrbs and , explaining how two types of explosions that are so different in their gamma - ray signature produce very similar sne . in this picture lgrbs and are two manifestations of a similar core collapse process that leads to a similar sn explosion mechanism and a similar grb central engine , where the observational outcome depends only on the slight differences in the existence , or the lack of , a low - mass extended envelope .",
    "this model also provides a simple explanation to the peculiar velocity profile seen in sne that are associated with .",
    "it also implies that are more promising sources of high energy neutrinos and gws than lgrbs .",
    "are viable candidates as the source of the observed extra - galactic diffuse neutrino flux and are promising gw sources for the next generation gw detectors .    a final comment on the progenitor structure of sn 2006aj .",
    "while the sn light curve constrains @xmath24 and @xmath26 it does not strongly constrain its density profile .",
    "the only requirement is that most of the mass @xmath24 is concentrated near @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with any density profile @xmath86 where @xmath87 increases with radius at @xmath88 and decreases at @xmath89 .",
    "thus , we can not determine whether the inferred progenitor structure is in hydrostatic equilibrium or whether the extended material was thrown out to @xmath26 a short time before the explosion",
    ". the latter option may be more attractive given that no current stellar evolution model predicts a hydrostatic structure similar to that sn 2006aj for a fully h stripped star , while recently there are several lines of evidence that massive stars go through a strongly enhanced mass - loss episode a short time before they explode @xcite . yet",
    ", another intriguing speculation is that the progenitor is affected by a binary , or maybe even by a binary merger ( e.g. , along similar lines to those suggested by @xcite ) , that put the extended material at place a short time before the explosion .",

    "the analysis of the progenitor structure of sn 2006aj relies on the identification of the first optical / uv peak as a cooling envelope emission . here",
    "this identification is justified by considering known and speculated emission power sources in sne and grbs .",
    "the conclusion is that while cooling envelope emission provides a natural explanation for the first peak ( as discussed in length in @xcite ) , all other sources are either ruled out or are highly unlikely .    _",
    "cooling envelope : _ the energy source of cooling envelope emission is the shock that crosses the star and any surrounding mass , if it exists , in regions where the diffusion time is longer than the expansion dynamical time . in these regions the internal energy deposited by the shock",
    "is trapped by the gas and it cools adiabatically during the gas expansion , hence the term `` cooling envelope '' . as the outflow expands its optical depth drop and so does the radiation diffusion time to the observer , while the expansion time grows . in regions where",
    "the two time scales become comparable the radiation escapes to the observer . as discussed in @xcite this source of emission",
    "provides a natural explanation for the first optical peak observed on a time scale of @xmath61day in case of a double peaked sne .",
    "important supporting evidence for that in the case of sn 2006aj is the very blue color of the first peak and the fact that the colors do not vary with time , which indicates that the band that we observe are most likely on the rayleigh - jeans part of a blackbody spectrum .",
    "this is expected for cooling envelope emission , where the optical depth at the source is high and the radiation has enough time to achieve thermal equilibrium before it escapes , even if the outflow is fast , after the ejecta expanded considerably @xcite .    _ radioactive decay of @xmath8ni : _ this power source of energy , which dominates many sne light curves , deposits energy at the known decay rate of @xmath8ni , first to @xmath8co and then to @xmath8fe .",
    "the observed luminosity form @xmath8ni is the energy deposited by radioactive decay in `` exposed '' regions , from where radiation can escape over a dynamical time . since the total amount of mass in exposed regions depends on time and velocity , the evolution of luminosity generated by @xmath8ni for a given outflow is set by the fraction of @xmath8ni in that region @xcite .",
    "this sets , at any given time , a maximal luminosity that @xmath8ni can produce , which is the luminosity of an outflow that is composed purly of @xmath8ni .",
    "the exposed mass at the first peak is @xmath90 implying that the maximal contribution of @xmath8ni to the luminosity at this time is @xmath91 erg / s .",
    "this rules out @xmath8ni as the source of the first peak which show a luminosity @xmath92 erg / s .",
    "_ interaction ( afterglow ) : _ another power source seen in some sne is a continuous interaction with the circum - stellar medium . in grbs",
    "such interaction is the source of the afterglow .",
    "the difference between continuous interaction and cooling envelope emission is that in the former the shock takes place in a region with optical depth that allows for radiation to escape immediately over a dynamical time scale .",
    "thus , if the first peak is generated by interaction then its luminosity is limited by the instantaneous strength of the interaction .",
    "namely , the explosion ejecta must drive a strong shock into the circum - stellar medium at least up to @xmath10 hr , at which point either the interaction dies ( e.g. , due to a sharp drop in the circum - stellar density ) or the shock becomes radiatively inefficient .",
    "the radio emission at @xmath93 day is presumably generated by such interaction and it shows that the interaction shock is propagating at a velocity close to the speed of light @xcite .",
    "the interaction at this point is much too weak to account for the optical emission at this epoch , but assuming that at @xmath10 hr the interaction have been much stronger , could it then be the source of the optical / uv ? considering all the outcomes of the entire allowed phase space for interaction",
    "is beyond the scope of this paper , however several general considerations show that it is highly unlikely that interaction can produce the observed first optical / uv peak for two reasons - it predicts an optical / uv spectrum that is too red and an x - ray flux that is too bright compared to the observations .",
    "as the interaction shock is mildly relativistic its radius at the first peak is @xmath94 cm .",
    "the circum - stellar medium must be optically thin for thomson scattering at this radius , otherwise the mildly relativistic shock breakout would have been taken place at @xmath95 cm , resulting in a much brighter and longer signal in gamma - rays then observed ( equation [ eq : breakout ] ) .",
    "emission from optically thin mildly relativistic shocks are seen in late stages of grbs and in some sne . in these cases",
    "the shock is collisionless and it generates strong magnetic fields and accelerates electrons to a power - law distribution . as a result the dominant emission is synchrotron and the spectrum above the self absorption frequency ( which is typically in the radio or mm bands ) is a power - law that is spread over many orders of magnitude in frequency with a specific flux @xmath96 with @xmath97 .",
    "this is very different than the observed uv spectrum where @xmath98 , which requires the self - absorption frequency to be @xmath99 hz .",
    "however , even the highest possible circum - stellar density that is optically thin for thomson scattering at @xmath100 cm does not bring the synchrotron ( or free - free ) self - absorption frequency of a mildly relativistic shock into the uv .",
    "in addition , the synchrotron power - law spectrum also predicts an x - ray luminosity that is comparable or larger than the uv luminosity , regardless of the location of the self - absorption frequency . in reality at the time of the first peak the x - ray luminosity is fainter than the uv by two orders of magnitude .    _",
    "continuous central engine activity : _ the last power source that is often considered in grbs and sometimes also in sne is a continuous energy supply by a central engine , possibly an accreting black - hole or a long lived magnetar . the existence of such sources in sne is still rather hypothetical , while in grbs there is stronger evidence that the central engine can be active also on time scales of hour or days .",
    "nevertheless , the optical emission is highly unlikely to be powered this way .",
    "the reason is that the bulk of the sn ejecta mass , @xmath101 , lies between the center of the explosion and the observer .",
    "the photons observed in the first optical peak must be generated at larger radius than that of the bulk of the ejecta .",
    "if the energy from the central engine is deposited first in the @xmath101 ejecta it is converted to kinetic and thermal energy of the ejecta before radiated away after the ejecta optical depth drops , over time scale of weeks .",
    "thus , similarly to lgrbs , the energy generated by the central engine must  penetrate \" through the bulk of the mass before being dissipated to optical / uv photons .",
    "again , like in lgrbs , this may be done if the engine continuously launches relativistic jets .",
    "however , based on grb observations , the expected optical / uv / x - ray emission from relativistic jets suffers from the same problems of interaction emission . it usually show a power - law spectrum with @xmath102 , which does not fit the observed optical / uv spectrum and the faint x - ray emission .",
    "more importantly , a relativistic jet must open a cavity in the sn ejecta inducing strong spherical asymmetry in the slow moving material , which is ruled out by the lack of polarization and by the spectral line profiles seen in the sn nebular phase @xcite .",
    "the general physics of a relativistic hydrodynamical jet that propagates in a surrounding medium is described at length in @xcite . here",
    "we provide a brief outline of this system , focusing on the time that the engine must work for the jet to penetrate through the core and through the extended material . a jet that propagates in surrounding media forms a forward - reverse shock structure at its head .",
    "the high pressure plasma in the jet head spills sideways continuously as the jet propagates forming a hot cocoon that engulfs the jet .",
    "this cocoon may or may not collimate the jet , depending on the jet and the external medium properties . since energy is leaving the jet head into the cocoon continuously , the head propagation depends on a continuous supply of energy , which is injected into the head by the jet via the reverse shock .",
    "thus , in order for the jet to propagate a given distance the engine that launches the jet must work for a duration that is long enough so a fresh jet material will continue to cross the reverse shock during the entire propagation .",
    "thus , if the head propagates up to a distance @xmath103 at a velocity @xmath104 the jet working time must be : @xmath105 where the term @xmath106 includes the relative velocity between the relativistic jet and the head .",
    "this term is @xmath107 for a newtonian head , implying that the engine working time is simply the jet propagation time .",
    "however , if the head is relativistic then by the time that the engine stops working the head is at a distance @xmath108 from the center and the last jet element that was launched by the engine will catch up with the head only after @xmath109 . during that time",
    "the jet will continue to drive the head forward .",
    "thus , the engine working time needed for a relativistic head to propagate a distance @xmath103 is much shorter than @xmath110 .    the evolution of the jet is determined by finding the properties of the various components ( e.g. , head , cocoon , etc . ) of that system .",
    "the propagation velocity of the head is set by the balance of the jet luminosity per unit area into the head and the ram pressure of the ambient medium .",
    "it is therefore useful to define a dimensionless parameter which is the ratio between the energy density of the jet and the rest - mass energy density of the ambient medium @xcite @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the total jet luminosity , @xmath113 is the jet cross - section at the head and @xmath114 is the ambient medium density at the head location .",
    "the propagation velocity of the jet head is : @xmath115 thus , the head is relativistic when @xmath116 and newtonian for @xmath117 .",
    "the collimation of the jet depends also on the half opening angle at which the jet is launched , @xmath118 , where for @xmath119 the jet is collimated by the cocoon pressure .",
    "the jet collimation affects the value of @xmath113 and thus also the value of @xmath120 . for a given set of parameters @xcite obtain : @xmath121 where @xmath12 is the time since the jet launching started and @xmath114 is the external density near the jet head location .",
    "equations [ eq : beta_head ] and [ eq : ltilde ] together can be solved to find the jet location at time @xmath12 .",
    "the isotropic equivalent luminosity of a typical grb jet is @xmath122 erg / s and its opening angle is @xmath123 .",
    "the beaming corrected jet luminosity is then @xmath124 . in a massive ( @xmath125 ) and compact ( @xmath126 cm ) core",
    "the density is high and @xmath127 , resulting in a newtonian ( or at most a mildly relativistic ) collimated jet .",
    "thus , the engine working time must be comparable to the time needed for the jet to cross the core : @xmath128 here we used the approximation @xmath129 which is appropriate for newtonian heads .",
    "the density of the extended material is much lower than in the core . as a result , for a typical grb jet @xmath130 , resulting in an uncollimated relativistic jet .",
    "the minimal engine working time for a successful jet penetration is shorter than the extended material light crossing time , but it is still much longer than the time it takes the jet to cross the core : @xmath131 where we used the approximation for a relativistic head @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the head lorentz factor ."
