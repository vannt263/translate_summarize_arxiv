    "the main idea is to restrict @xmath12 to a domain where we understand how it acts  functions which vanish at the position of the scatterer and therefore do not  feel \" its presence .",

    "a simple computation of the adjoint @xmath33 shows that its domain is given by @xmath34 we have the following definition .",
    "the deficiency spaces of a symmetric densely defined operator @xmath35 are given by the kernels @xmath36 the deficiency indices of @xmath35 are defined as @xmath37 and @xmath38 . if @xmath39 , then we say that @xmath35 is essentially self - adjoint .",

    "the associated eigenfunctions are superpositions of laplacian eigenfunctions and vanish at @xmath26 and therefore do not feel the effect of the scatterer . in the present article",
    "we will only be interested in the new eigenvalues , which are solutions to , and the associated new eigenfunctions .",
    "two different quantisations appear in the literature on point scatterers , and we will follow the terminology used by shigehara et al . in the papers @xcite in referring to the two models as _ weak _ and",
    "_ strong _ coupling .",
    "the purpose of this section is to explain how these different quantisations arose in the literature and give a derivation of the strong coupling quantisation on a 2d torus .    in his famous paper on wave chaos in a singular billiard @xcite seba considered a point scatterer on a rectangle with irrational aspect ratio and dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "seba computed the spectrum of @xmath61 by solving the equation numerically and a plot of the level spacing distribution seemed to suggest level repulsion .    in 1994",
    "shigehara came to investigate this question and following careful numerical investigations he observed @xcite that the eigenvalue spacing distribution of the self - adjoint extension @xmath61 seemed to coincide with that of the laplacian , which according to the conjecture of berry and tabor @xcite is believed to be poissonian .",
    "shigehara observed that the apparent  weakness \" of the point scatterer in seba s quantisation could be corrected by adjusting the parameter @xmath89 in a suitable way as the eigenvalue @xmath90 tends to infinity .",

    "the situation is more complicated in 2 or 3d .",
    "a relation can be derived ( at a physical level of rigour ) from the scattering problem for a spherical scatterer ( cf .",
    "for instance @xcite ) by shrinking its diameter to zero .",
    "one obtains a relation which in contrast to the 1d case contains a logarithmic divergence in the spectral parameter @xmath90 @xmath94 for certain real constants @xmath95 , @xmath96 which depend on the domain .    so a fixed choice of @xmath89 corresponds to weak coupling , @xmath97 on the other hand a fixed physical coupling constant @xmath98 would require a renormalisation of the parameter @xmath89 , which means @xmath99 should be allowed to depend on @xmath90 as @xmath100 , @xmath101    the renormalisation condition is equivalent to a different quantisation condition for a point scatterer ( cf . for instance @xcite ) which only takes into account the physically relevant energies in the summation , @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the physical coupling constant .",

    "the analogous result was proved in @xcite for the standard 3d torus and general 3d tori which satisfy certain irrationality conditions .",
    "the proof of theorem [ wave function stats ] uses the explicit formula for the green s function and by approximating the green s function by a sum over a polynomial size interval the problem can be translated into a number theoretical problem about the well - spacedness of lattice points in thin annuli .    in a recent paper @xcite marklof and rudnick",
    "have shown that for rational polygons a full density of eigenfunctions of the laplacian equidistributes in position space .",
    "in particular their result applies to the square torus .",
    "their proof uses egorov s theorem .",
    "quantum ergodicity does of course not hold for the laplacian eigenfunctions on the torus .",
    "if one chooses an eigenbasis of plane waves , the eigenfunctions are obviously localised in momentum .",
    "it is an interesting question to ask if the presence of a ( weakly or strongly coupled ) point scatterer can change this .",
    "curiously , the answer depends on the arithmetic properties of the lattice @xmath70 .    for both a weakly and strongly coupled point scatterer it is possible @xcite to prove quantum ergodicity for @xmath153 and it is likely that one can generalise this to any rational lattice . on the other hand",
    "one can disprove quantum ergodicity in the irrational case . the failure of quantum ergodicity in the closely related case of the seba billiard ( which has an irrational aspect ratio ) was already conjectured by berkolaiko , keating and winn @xcite .    in @xcite keating , marklof and winn prove under assumptions on the spectrum ( which are consistent with the berry - tabor conjecture ) that there exists a positive density subsequence of eigenfunctions for the seba billiard ( weak coupling ) which become localised around two laplacian eigenfunctions .",
    "in particular it follows that this subsequence becomes localised in the high energy limit , therefore disproving quantum ergodicity .",

    "it would be interesting to prove this result without any assumptions on the spectrum . in the closely related case of a weakly coupled point scatterer on an irrational 2d torus the failure of quantum ergodicity",

    "* open problems : * _ what are the quantum limits for a point scatterer on the square torus in the weak and strong coupling regimes ?",
    "how about general rational and irrational 2d tori ?",
    "how about 3d tori ? _",
    "one of the main observations in seba s paper @xcite was level repulsion for a point scatterer in a rectangular billiard with dirichlet boundary conditions and irrational aspect ratio .",
    "seba computed the eigenvalues numerically and plotted the spacing distribution which did indeed reveal some form of level repulsion and he initially conjectured that the spacing distribution should coincide with that of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) in random matrix theory .",
    "as shigehara @xcite discovered later , level repulsion , as observed by seba , could only be expected in the strong coupling regime , where the extension parameter is normalised in a suitable way as the eigenvalue tends to infinity .",
    "it is likely that seba carried out a truncation of the spectral equation ( similar to the one in lemma [ truncation ] ) when performing the numerics , so effectively he calculated the eigenvalues for the strong coupling quantisation .",
    "based on careful numerics , shigehara predicted that one should recover poissonian level statistics in the weak coupling regime , as was expected for the unperturbed laplacian on an irrational rectangle .",
    "in other words , the effect of the scatterer in this regime was too weak to have an impact in the high energy limit . in 3d , however , the situation is very different .",
    "numerics suggest that the eigenvalues of a fixed self - adjoint extension obey intermediate level statistics , just as in the strong coupling regime in 2d @xcite .    in a 1999 paper @xcite bogomolny , gerland and",
    "schmit argued that the spacing distribution was close to a semi - poissonian distribution .",
    "the seba billiard thus belongs to an intermediate class of systems which shows a weaker form of level repulsion than chaotic systems .",
    "another example of such intermediate systems are flat surfaces with conic singularities .",
    "intermediate statistics have also been observed for certain families of quantum maps @xcite and near the transition point in the anderson model in 3d ( cf .",
    "@xcite , section 6 . 1 . 3 . ,",
    "p. 332 - 3 ) .",
    "there is also a recent paper by stckmann , kuhl and tudorovskiy @xcite which claims to revise the results of bogomolny , gerland and schmit in @xcite .",
    "the paper contains heuristic mathematical arguments and numerics which show a transition from level repulsion to poissonian spacing statistics for the seba biliard in the high energy limit .",
    "however , the quantisation condition used in @xcite can be shown to correspond to the weak coupling regime  as opposed to the strong coupling regime considered by bogomolny , gerland and schmit .",
    "the poissonian statistics observed in @xcite are therefore hardly surprising , as they were already predicted by shigehara in @xcite . a rigorous mathematical proof that the spacing distribution of a weakly coupled point scatterer coincides with that of the laplacian on the 2d torus is given in the paper @xcite and we will discuss this result and others below .",
    "there are many open questions regarding the spectral statistics of point scatterers on flat tori . even in the case of the unperturbed laplacian , little",
    "can be said rigorously .",
    "let @xmath157 and define @xmath158 if @xmath153 , we have the following asymptotic which is due to landau @xcite @xmath159 if @xmath70 is an irrational lattice , then the multiplicity of the laplacian eigenvalues is on average @xmath160 ( for a generic vector @xmath161 $ ] the other three choices are @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 ) .",

    "we have the following conjecture which is due to berry and tabor @xcite and is expected to hold for a generic classically integrable quantum system . we will only state it in the special case of flat 2d tori .",
    "this conjecture remains out of reach , even a proof of the existence of the spacing distribution is not available .",
    "however , some progress has been made with regard to the pair correlation function @xcite , in cases where the aspect ratio satisfies certain diophantine properties .",
