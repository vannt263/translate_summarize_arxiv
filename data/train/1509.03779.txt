    "glycine ( nh@xmath0ch@xmath0cooh ) , the simplest amino acid , has been identified in cometary @xcite and meteoritic samples @xcite , however it is not yet known whether the species is formed in these solid bodies , in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , or both . indeed , a detection in the ism has so far proven ellusive @xcite .",
    "although chemical models predict the formation of glycine in the ism , in low abundance ( see , e.g. @xcite and refs . therein ) , it has been difficult to observationally constrain them without a detection of the species .",
    "the relative likelihood of different possible formation routes can , however , be constrained by careful observation of the reactants used in the chemical models to form glycine .",
    "one pathway which has garnered significant interest is the formation of glycine through the reaction of hydroxylamine ( nh@xmath0oh ) , or its protonated and ionized derivatives , with acetic acid ( ch@xmath3cooh ) , a known interstellar molecule @xcite .",
    "ionization or protonation of nh@xmath0oh under interstellar conditions should be efficient @xcite , and subsequent laboratory work has demonstrated the formation of glycine from nh@xmath0oh and its ionized and protonated forms @xcite . although recent theoretical work has suggested that these gas - phase routes forming glycine through these reactions are inefficient under interstellar conditions @xcite , condensed - phase surface - mediated reactions remain a possibility , and observational constraints of the precursors are still desirable for the refinement of models .",
    "while acetic acid is readily - constrained , nh@xmath0oh has yet to be observed in the ism .    in recent years , laboratory work has shown that a number of pathways exist which result in efficient formation of nh@xmath0oh on grain surfaces .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the formation of nh@xmath0oh in h@xmath0o - nh@xmath3 ices after uv - irradiation .",
    "formation by successive hydrogenation of no has been shown to proceed efficiently , barrierlessly , and in high yield @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite demonstrated the efficient formation of nh@xmath0oh via oxidation of nh@xmath3 in ices with a low barrier to activation ( of order 1000 k ) .",
    "earlier modeling work by @xcite also suggested that nh@xmath0oh is formed in high abundance in interstellar ices , and is subsequently liberated into the gas - phase during the warm - up period of emerging hot cores and hot corinos in readily - detectable quantities .",
    "observational efforts by @xcite , however , failed to detect nh@xmath0oh toward a selection of such sources known to be rich in complex organic material ( e.g. sgr b2(n ) and orion - kl ) establishing upper limits of n@xmath9 .",
    "refinement of the @xcite model in subsequent work @xcite , as well as limiting modeling presented in the aforementioned laboratory studies , resulted in predicted gas - phase abundances in line with the upper limits established by @xcite . yet , with the inclusion of the h + hno @xmath10 hnoh pathway into the model , as described by the laboratory work of @xcite , condensed phase abundances of nh@xmath0oh again approach n@xmath11 , with gas - phase abundances of n@xmath12 .",
    "the @xcite model largely assumes that the release of nh@xmath0oh into the gas - phase is a gradual process dominated by the warm - up of the hot core .",
    "both the laboratory work and the models , however , predict nh@xmath0oh is initially formed in large abundance at very cold ( @xmath13 k ) temperatures and early in the evolution of these sources",
    ". thus , the most optimistic source for a detection of gas - phase nh@xmath0oh is one where the reservoir of condensed - phase nh@xmath0oh formed at low temperatures is liberated _ en masse _ into the gas - phase prior to release by thermal mechanisms .",
    "shocked regions displaying high degrees of molecular complexity likely represent this best - case scenario . in these regions ,",
    "complex molecules are formed efficiently in ices at low temperatures , but are not otherwise liberated into the gas - phase except by thermal desorption at much greater temperatures . when these ices are subjected to shocks ,",
    "however , the mantle is non - thermally ejected into the gas - phase , resulting in large abundances of relatively cool ( @xmath14 k ) , complex organic material ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most prominent of these regions is the young protostellar outflow l1157 .",
    "numerous recent studies report high degrees of molecular complexity arising from shocked regions within the outflow , which originates in cold , quiescent gas around the protostar ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .    here , we present deep searches for nh@xmath0oh using the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) at @xmath15 mm and the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) at @xmath16 mm toward the l1157 outflow .",
    "we report non - detections of nh@xmath0oh in both searches . in order to derive upper limits to the column density of nh@xmath0oh",
    ", we use transitions of ch@xmath3oh observed with the cso to constrain the kinetic temperature and density in the shocked gas using a radiative - transfer approach , and carma images of ch@xmath3oh to determine the size of the shocked gas .",
    "finally , we estimate upper limits to the abundance of nh@xmath0oh and discuss possible implications .",
    "l1157 is a dark cloud in cepheus located a distance of @xmath17250 pc @xcite , and contains a prototypical shocked bipolar outflow from a class 0 protostar .",
    "it has been the subject of great interest in the last twenty years , with numerous studies investigating the physical conditions within the source . due to the variety of methods used for these studies , direct comparisons between results",
    "is challenging .",
    "nevertheless , an overall picture does come into view , and this general description will be sufficient for the discussion presented here .    originating in the cold , quiescent gas ( @xmath18 k , @xcite ) surrounding the class 0 protostar l1157-mm ,",
    "the southern lobe of the accelerated outflow ( @xmath19 k , @xcite ) has undergone two major shocks , referred to as l1157-b1 and l1157-b2 .",
    "the b1 shock is younger and warmer ( @xmath172000 yr , @xmath20 k ) than the b2 shock ( @xmath174000 yr , @xmath21 k ) , and many complex chemical species are observed in enhanced abundance toward both shocks due to non - thermal desorption from grains @xcite . while the absolute values of these physical parameters vary somewhat within the literature , this qualitative picture and enhancement in chemical abundance is consistently reported .",

    "a similar argument using the co column density of @xmath162  @xmath5 for b2 found by @xcite also results in an h@xmath0 column density  of  @xmath17@xmath161  @xmath5 .",

    ", we again assume that nh@xmath0oh , if present in the gas phase , originates in the warm , shocked gas traced by the warm , dense ch@xmath3oh component .",
    "the spectra extracted from a 12  beam centered on these locations are shown in figure [ nh2ohcarma ] . while there is an unidentified feature at the frequency of the @xmath165 nh@xmath0oh transition , if this were truly nh@xmath0oh emission , the other transitions in the observed window would be of equal or greater intensity .",

    "is predicted to be strongest .",
    "as both b1 and b2 have densities higher than @xmath150 for this transition ( see table [ nh2ohparams ] ) , we again derive an upper limit to the column density assuming lte conditions .    following the same procedure as for the cso data ,",

    "in  [ results ] , we assumed that nh@xmath0oh , if present , would arise predominantly the warm , shocked regions b1 or b2 , rather than the molecular outflow .",
    "@xcite show that nh@xmath0oh is thermally liberated from their laboratory samples between 160  180 k , whereas for realistic interstellar ices and conditions , temperatures above @xmath17110 k are likely sufficient @xcite .",
    "both our non - lte fits , and the literature values discussed earlier have shown that temperatures in the targeted regions are below these thresholds , and thus a thermal mechanism for the desorption of nh@xmath0oh from grain surfaces in l1157 is unlikely . thus , non - thermal desorption in the shocks should be the dominant mechanism for nh@xmath0oh liberation , and any nh@xmath0oh emission should trace these shocked regions .",
    "the upper limit column densities established with the carma data are equivalent to those established by @xcite of @xmath174 @xmath5 .",
    "the limits established by @xcite , however , are beam - averaged column densities , whereas the carma measurements presented here provide a more well - constrained source size , and thus a more robust upper limit . nevertheless , the upper limits to relative abundance found here are significantly higher than those determined by @xcite of @xmath1710@xmath175 due to the low h@xmath0 column in the region .",
    "these low columns are common in other chemically - complex shocked regions as well , such as a host of galactic center clouds studied by @xcite ( @xmath176 @xmath5 ) , and other shocked outflows like bhr 71 ( @xmath177 @xmath5 ; @xcite ) .    yet , these regions likely represent the best - case scenario for a gas - phase detection of nh@xmath0oh .",
    "such a detection is critical to accurately constrain the application of laboratory results , which show nh@xmath0oh is a significant player in grain - surface nitrogen chemistry , to chemical models .",
    "the deep search presented here stretched the capabilities of the cso and carma to the limit ; searches deep enough to be sensitive to the relative abundances predicted by laboratory work and modeling are simply time - prohibitive on these types of instruments .",
    "the @xcite model , without the addition of the h + hno @xmath10 hnoh pathway , predicts peak condensed - phase nh@xmath0oh abundances of @xmath17@xmath178 , which , if liberated _ en masse _ in a shock , is a detectable population , but likely only with the sensitivity and spatial resolution of alma .",
    "the upper limits established here , however , are several orders of magnitude lower than both the condensed - phase and gas - phase populations predicted by the augmented model which includes this hydrogenation pathway .",
    "thus , our results demonstrate that further efforts are needed both in modeling and in the laboratory , to identify and fully - constrain both the formation and the destruction pathways for nh@xmath0oh .",

    "in the case of b1 , the shock is positioned off - center of the beam , making the emission more sensitive to fall - off effects that are not accounted for explicitly in the calculations .",
    "we therefore assume a factor of two uncertainty in source size to take both issues into consideration , which is reflected in @xmath183 .",
    "these result in net uncertainties of @xmath1732% in the absolute intensity of the observed transitions , with the largest contribution from the absolute flux calibration .",
