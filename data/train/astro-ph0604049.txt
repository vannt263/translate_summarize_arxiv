    "the dramatic increase in the number of surveys for planetary transits over the last five years has resulted in a wealth of high - precision stellar photometry @xcite .",
    "although primarily conducted to detect planetary transits , such surveys also produce data sets that allow for intensive investigation of stellar variability . especially useful",
    "are surveys of clusters , which can be used to characterize the variability content of the cluster .",
    "detections of eclipsing binaries can provide a check on the cluster s distance , as well as helping to characterize the mass - radius and mass - luminosity relationships .",
    "many surveys of clusters have already published data sets of high - precision photometry , finding low - amplitude variables , eclipsing binaries , and other pulsating stars .",
    "the pisces ( planets in stellar clusters extensive search ) project has observed clusters ngc 2158 and ngc 6791 @xcite .",
    "the explore / oc ( extrasolar planet occultation research / open clusters ) project has observed clusters ngc 2660 and ngc 6208 @xcite .",
    "other projects have observed or are observing ngc 7789 , 6819 , and 6940 @xcite , ngc 6633 @xcite , and ngc 6705 @xcite .    the survey for transiting extrasolar planets in stellar systems ( stepss ) @xcite concentrates on searching open clusters for planetary transits .",
    "searching for transits in clusters is advantageous as clusters have known metallicities , ages , and stellar densities , and are therefore good laboratories for determining the distribution of planets without varying those stellar and environmental properties . here",
    "we present an analysis of the observations of ngc 1245 to catalog the stellar variables in the cluster .",
    "see @xcite for a full discussion of the parameters of the cluster .",
    "ngc 1245 is a rich open cluster with an age of @xmath3 gyr .",
    "it has a metallicity slightly less than solar , [ fe / h ] @xmath4 .",
    "the cluster is at a distance of @xmath5 kpc , with distance modulus of @xmath6 .",
    "the core radius is @xmath7 arcmin ( @xmath8 pc ) .",
    "the total cluster mass is @xmath9 .",
    "all errors given above are systematic , and are larger than the statistical errors .",
    "the stepss project observed ngc 1245 over the course of 19 nights in october and november 2001 .",
    "the observations were obtained with the mdm 8k mosaic imager on the mdm 2.4 m hiltner telescope yielding a @xmath10 field of view with @xmath11 resolution per pixel . in total , the dataset consists of 936 @xmath12-band images with typical exposure times of 300 s. for the color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , several supplementary @xmath13 and @xmath14 band images were also obtained .",
    "none of the nights were photometric , and so a second series of observations was taken in february 2002 to calibrate the cluster photometry .",
    "we follow the procedure outlined in @xcite to generate light curves , which develops a new method for differential photometry given the demands of detecting transiting extrasolar planets ( @xmath15 mag precision ) .",
    "the main features of the method include allowing each star to have a unique comparison ensemble , minimization of the light curve standard deviation as a figure of merit , and full automation . applying this method yields light curves that have sub-1% precision for @xmath16 .    of the 6787 stars identified in the survey s field of view",
    ", we estimate @xmath1 belong to the cluster .",
    "this estimate comes from scaling and subtracting star counts from a control field on the outskirts of our field of view .",
    "figure [ fig : cmd ] shows the @xmath14 , @xmath17 cmd of the cluster field along with the best - fit isochrone from @xcite , derived from the theoretical isochrones of @xcite . given the cluster age , metallicity , distance , and reddening , the best - fit isochrone transforms an observed apparent magnitude into the stellar properties assuming the star is a cluster member . using the stellar mass as the independent variable , we determine the stellar mass which minimizes the @xmath18 distance between the apparent magnitude and the best - fit isochrone magnitudes in the @xmath19 passbands .",
    "a caveat for assigning stellar properties based on the cmd is the assumption that the detected stellar light arises from a single main - sequence cluster member .",
    "the stellar properties contain significant systematic errors if the object does not belong to the cluster or if a portion of the stellar light arises from an unresolved stellar companion .",
    "the physical properties for the variable sources detected in this study should be regarded with extra caution considering that most sources of variability result from the binary nature of an object @xcite and thus have a large probability for significant stellar companion contamination .",
    "one of the great challenges in determining variability with high precision photometry is the difficulty of distinguishing intrinsic variability from noise and systematic errors .",
    "common classes of variable stars demonstrate both large amplitude variations and periodic behavior , making them both easily detected and easily characterized . however , with the advent of surveys which observe thousands of stars with millimagnitude photometry , robustly detecting variations at low noise levels requires a variety of statistical selection criteria . some surveys , such as asas , the all sky automated survey @xcite , and ogle , the optical gravitational lensing experiment @xcite , have developed automated classification pipelines .",
    "many surveys , though , use a few simple statistical cuts to identify variable stars independent on the source or type of variability .",
    "our variability selection routine has three stages .",
    "first , we eliminate outlying measurements , and require a minimum number of remaining measurements .",
    "second , we compute three different statistics that describe the behavior of the lightcurve : the root - mean - square ( rms ) , the stetson @xmath20 statistic @xcite , and the aov periodicity statistic @xcite .",
    "we apply cuts on each of those values to select variable candidates .",
    "third , we visually inspect the lightcurves and images of the variable candidates to eliminate false positive candidates with variability due to blending effects from nearby objects or detector defects . in  [ sec : finalcuts ] , we describe two tiers of statistical cuts .",
    "the first , more stringent cut does not contain any false positives . a second , less stringent , cut with higher sensitivity contains lower amplitude variables , but also contains @xmath21 7% false positives , which are later eliminated through visual inspection .",
    "the first stage of the analysis removes statistically outlying photometric measurements .",
    "outliers are identified in the following manner : for each star we calculate the reduced chi - square light curve variability , @xmath22 where the sum is over @xmath23 observations , @xmath24 , with error @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the weighted average magnitude of the light curve , @xmath27 the @xmath28 statistic measures the degree to which a constant light curve model approximates the light curve data within the context of the measurement errors .",
    "light curves with intrinsic variability result in high @xmath18 values , denoting that a constant light curve model poorly represents the data . before eliminating outlying measurements ,",
    "we scale the errors by setting @xmath29 , thus enforcing @xmath30 . the error scaling allows the gaussian noise , systematic error , or intrinsic variability ( whichever noise source dominates the scatter in the light curve ) to set the scale for judging whether a measurement is a statistical outlier .",
    "this procedure can eliminate intrinsic variability that affects a small number of the measurements .",
    "this hampers our ability to detect large amplitude eclipsing binaries when only a single eclipse occurred during the observations .",
    "however , given our quantitative selection criteria and documented analysis techniques , these biases can easily be accounted for with a more detailed inspection of the data .    for each observation , we compute the deviation , @xmath31 .",
    "all photometric measurements with @xmath32 are eliminated .",
    "we perform three iterations of the above procedure for each light curve .",
    "the light curves with @xmath21750 measurements remaining typically result from false stellar detections near the cores of bright isolated stars and are discarded .",
    "we also eliminate light curves with rms @xmath33 mag , since no light curves with higher scatter show any kind of coherent intrinsic variability .      the stetson @xmath20 statistic @xcite provides our primary measure of the coherent intrinsic light curve variability .",
    "the statistic measures variability by weighting photometric variations that are correlated in time . a light curve with a steady change in brightness over a period of time results in a higher @xmath20 value than a curve with gaussian noise , even though both curves may have equal values for @xmath28 .",
    "the statistic is defined by @xmath34 where the observer defines @xmath23 pairs of observations with weights @xmath35 .",
    "we define observations as a pair when they are separated by less than 0.02 days .",
    "@xmath36 is the product of the normalized residuals of two observations @xmath37 and @xmath38 , constituting the @xmath39th pair , such that @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the `` relative error '' , defined as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the apparent magnitude of the star , @xmath44 is the error in the magnitude , and @xmath26 is the weighted mean magnitude of the star .",
    "following the choices of @xcite , we set @xmath45 for pairs of observations ( @xmath46 ) and @xmath47 for single observations ( @xmath48 ) , and we also multiply the final quality @xmath20 by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the total weight the star would have if it were measured on all images .    of the stars we observe ,",
    "the stetson statistic varies from @xmath51 for nonvariable sources , to @xmath52 for obvious variables . for objects with @xmath53",
    ", it can be difficult to demarcate a specific cut in @xmath20 to specify variability .",
    "we describe our choices for cuts on @xmath20 in  [ sec : finalcuts ] .      to select periodic variations , we apply the multiharmonic analysis of variances ( anova ) period - search algorithm described by @xcite .",
    "given a range of periods , the anova algorithm produces a likelihood statistic , @xmath54 , that returns the quality of fit for orthonormal polynomials to the light curve variability .",
    "since the observations occurred over a duration of 19 days , we run the anova algorithm over a period range of 0.1 days to 14 days , which we believe to be the variability periods that we could reasonably detect .",
    "one problem with applying the anova algorithm to ground - based observations is the appearance of significant light curve variability on the diurnal period and its aliases .",
    "the rise and set of the field of observation and the corresponding secular changing atmospheric path length and mechanical stresses on the telescope impart systematic errors in the light curve .",
    "our light curves display trends in the light curve variability as a function of seeing . in  [",
    "sec : membership ] we correct for these trends , but trends above the expected gaussian noise remain .",
    "we find signs of aliasing primarily at periods of 1/3 , 1/2 , 2/3 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 days .",
    "relying on the anova statistic alone results in many detections of low amplitude ( @xmath21 0.01 mag ) variables with periods at the diurnal period and its aliases .",
    "however , in combination with the stetson @xmath20 statistic ( see  [ sec : finalcuts ] ) these alias variables do not make it into the final variable object samples .",
    "there are several systematic effects that complicate the attempt to impose categorical cuts in @xmath20 and @xmath55 that result in a sample that includes all probable intrinsic variables and zero false detections .",
    "systematic errors in the light curve , such as blended objects , edge effects , detector defects , and detector saturation can artificially inflate @xmath20 and @xmath55 for non - variable sources .",
    "furthermore , such effects , along with poor photometry , can in some cases lead to lower @xmath20 and @xmath55 values for true variables , compared to perfect photometry .",
    "we conclude that the most useful evaluation of the variability in our sample is a two - tier selection , in which we identify stars with robust variability and zero false detections , and then a second tier of candidate variables with a less stringent selection and resulting in sample with some low contamination due to false detections .",
    "our first tier consists of stringent cuts on the @xmath20 and @xmath55 statistical values .",
    "we find that cuts of @xmath56 and @xmath57 yield an ensemble of 23 stars which are all clearly intrinsic variables .",
    "the first tier has zero contamination due to false positives .",
    "however , it misses a number of other clear variables that vary with lower amplitudes .",
    "we then conduct a visual inspection of the images of the remaining sources , and flag those that are near detector defects such as bad columns , diffraction spikes , bleed trails , etc .",
    "a second tier cut of @xmath58 and @xmath59 includes most stars in our sample that have coherently varying light curves and includes few false positives .",
    "this second cut contains 44 variable candidates , including all the first tier objects .",
    "visual inspection of the lightcurves and images of these stars enables us to eliminate three of the second tier stars due to detection effects , yielding a contamination rate of @xmath60 .",
    "based on a visual inspection of light curves , the contamination rate climbs rapidly for lower statistical cuts . upon visual inspection of stars",
    "that do not make the cuts , we do find two more field stars that show coherent , periodic variability at low amplitudes .",
    "we include these two stars in our field star sample .",
    "we show the light curves and photometric properties of the potential cluster members meeting both selection cuts in figures [ fig : p0 ] though [ fig : p4 ] .",
    "the plots for the field variables are in figures [ fig : p5 ] though [ fig : p10 ] . for each variable",
    "we show the unphased lightcurve in panel ( a ) for the full 19 days of the survey .",
    "in panel ( b ) we show the phased lightcurve of the variable , with two periods plotted . in the upper right corner",
    "is a finding chart showing the variable marked with white bars .",
    "the nearest detected object is marked with gray bars , and the light curve for the nearest object is shown in panel ( c ) , phased to the period of the variable .",
    "we show the phased lightcurve for the nearest source because some of the millimagnitude amplitude variables are visually blended .",
    "having an object nearby with similar blending complications that does not reveal variability confirms the intrinsic nature of the low amplitude variable .",
    "for completeness , we also show light curves in figure [ fig : low_vars ] for two objects that do not survive the second tier cuts , but visually demonstrate intrinsic variability .",
    "it should be noted that the dophot photometry detection software can not successfully identify every object in the images .",
    "objects that are too heavily blended , elongated , faint , saturated , etc . , do not make it through the photometry pipeline .",
    "therefore , the nearest object identified by the software may not be the nearest object to the variable . in most cases , however , the object identified as nearest is still close enough to the variable for the light curve comparison to be useful .",
    "we plot the properties of the potential cluster variables in table [ tab : mvars ] , and the field variables in table [ tab : fvars ] , with the two visually selected stars listed separately . for a variable to belong to the cluster it must have @xmath19 apparent magnitudes consistent with the cluster main sequence . for potential cluster members ,",
    "we give estimates for the stellar properties based on the cmd ( see  [ sec : membership ] ) , and we classify their variable types ( see  [ sec : vars ] ) if possible .",
    "both tables give magnitudes and positional data for all the variable stars .",

    "early f - type stars containing multiple frequencies with periods of 0.4 to 3 days and 0.01 to 0.1 mag v - band amplitudes typify the @xmath2 doradus class @xcite .",

    "the light curves for stars 70025 , 20196 , 20223 , and 20214 show evidence of @xmath2 doradus variability .",

    "these four objects have unique signatures that set them apart from the others . for a majority of cluster variables , only the fundamental and harmonics exist in the light curve , whereas for the four @xmath2 doradus candidates , multiple frequencies exist that are not integer fractions of the fundamental .",

    "each panel shows a single night s data and the lines represent models of the variability with successively increased number of frequencies as identified in the spectral analysis .",
    "the solid line shows the first detected frequency fit to the data , the long - dashed line gives a two - component fit , and the short - dashed line gives a three - component fit .",
    "figures [ fig : gdor1 ] and [ fig : gdor2 ] show the @xcite optimum spectra statistic of the light curve as a function of frequency in the lower parts of the figures .",
    "the panels show successive identification of the frequencies present in the light curve from top to bottom .",
    "if a confident frequency is present , the frequency and its amplitude is noted in the upper right hand corner of the panel .",
    "we confidently detect a frequency when it appears in all variants of the light curves which we explain next .",
    "when applying the spectral analysis to the cluster binary variables 60193 and 20534 , their high amplitude , short period , and regularity allows us to detect numerous frequencies which are all harmonics of the fundamental .",
    "however , in the original light curves , lower significance frequencies were found very close to the dominant frequency detected . for binary stars this frequency splitting can occur if spot patterns on the close binaries appear or vary .",
    "the frequency splitting can also occur if the exposure timing is not accurate , or as we discovered during this study , it can result from corrections to the light curves to reduce systematic errors .",
    "we find the procedure for removing the systematic trend in a light curve performs less than ideal in the presence of high amplitude variability .",
    "it slightly distorts the light curve enough to give rise to frequency splitting .",
    "the close frequency splitting is reduced when analyzing light curves without the seeing trend correction .",
    "in addition , the frequency splitting is further reduced by eliminating the last two nights of data .",
    "this suggests that the timing may be an issue over the baseline of observations .",
    "however , considering that the last two nights had some of the best seeing , it is not clear which of these two factors is the cause of the frequency splitting .",
    "overall , the cleanest spectral analysis  which detects only harmonics  for stars 60193 and 20534 occurs without the seeing correction and without the last two nights of data .",
    "thus , we define confidently detected frequencies in our @xmath2 doradus candidates as ones that are stable and detected in all variants of the light curves : the original light curves , light curves without the seeing correction , light curves without the last two nights of data , and light curves without the seeing correction and without the last two nights of data .",
    "in addition to the multiple frequencies confidently identified in these 4 objects that are not harmonically related , these objects also occupy the upper main sequence in the cmd as expected for the typical spectral type for @xmath2 doradus variables . the large circles in figure  [ fig : cmd ]",
    "designate their location in the cmd .",
    "however , the @xmath17 and estimated temperature for candidates 20214 and 20223 ( @xmath74 and @xmath75",
    "k ) are redward and cooler than the empirically determined cool - edge boundary for @xmath2 doradus variables as defined by @xcite ( @xmath17=0.38 ) .",
    "the empirical cool edge of @xcite agrees well with the theoretical @xmath2 doradus instability strip as given by @xcite ( @xmath76 k ) .",
    "alternatively , our effective temperatures may be systematically incorrect .",
    "the effective temperatures for these objects are estimated from the cmd and the best - fit cluster isochrone as described in @xcite .",
    "varying the metallicity of the cluster between -0.26@xmath77 \\leq$]+0.13 while minimizing age , distance , and reddening to yield a best - fit isochrone to the observed cmd , yields a maximum @xmath78 k for these two stars . reaching this high temperature requires an implausible @xmath79=+0.13 $ ] .",
    "thus , if objects 20214 and 20223 are confirmed as @xmath2 doradus stars they may represent the coolest known members of this class of variables .",
    "also , the @xmath2 doradus candidates discovered in this study may represent the oldest known members of this class of variables given the @xmath801 gyr age for ngc 1245 @xcite .    confirming the @xmath2 doradus variables will require follow up spectroscopy and simultaneous light curves in several passbands .",
    "however , alternative models for the variability can not reproduce the multiple frequencies that are not harmonically related .",
    "this is especially the case for objects 70025 and 20214 where we confidently detect three components @xcite .",
    "additionally , estimating the physical parameters of the stars from the best - fit isochrone we calculate the pulsation constant to range from -0.57@xmath81 - 0.39 for our candidates .",
    "these values are consistent with the confirmed @xmath2 doradus variables of @xcite .",
    "we used the strongest , first frequency detected when calculating the pulsation constant .    assuming these four objects are @xmath2 doradus variables , we are able to measure the fraction of cluster members exhibiting this type of variability .",
    "@xcite statistically determine the cluster membership by characterizing the background star counts as a function of apparent magnitude from a control field at the outskirts of the field of view .",
    "the cluster membership as a function of magnitude is shown as figure 9 in @xcite .",
    "there is an estimated 45.9 cluster members for ngc 1245 between 15.83@xmath8216.27 , the apparent magnitudes of our brightest and faintest @xmath2 doradus candidates .",
    "this corresponds to 2.88@xmath833.32 assuming a cluster distance modulus @xmath84 and extinction @xmath85 . if all four objects are confirmed as @xmath2 doradus variables , then",
    "8.7% of stars with properties similar to ngc 1245 in the above absolute magnitude range exhibit @xmath2 doradus variability .",
    "if none of the objects end up being @xmath2 doradus variables , then a null result implies @xmath86 ( 95% confidence ) of stars in this magnitude range exhibit @xmath2 doradus variability assuming we are 100% complete in detecting variability with amplitudes similar to the candidates .",
    "we have discovered 43 previously unknown variables in the field of ngc 1245 , of which 14 are potential cluster members .",
    "many of these variables are very low amplitude .",
    "our method for determining relative photometry allows us to achieve sub-1% precision for stars brighter than @xmath87 , enabling the characterization of such low amplitude variables .",
    "the techniques described in this paper can be readily applied to other long - term photometric data sets to determine the variability content of other surveys .",
    "we roughly characterize the variables potentially belonging to the cluster .",
    "the light curves for objects 20534 , 20176 , 60193 , 10462 , and 60303 contain strong evidence for binarity .",
    "object 10462 and 60303 are detached eclipsing binaries .",
    "if their membership in this cluster is confirmed , then the known ages and composition of these binaries offer opportunities for testing stellar models for cool stars .",
    "the light curves for objects 20196 , 70025 , 20223 , 20214 have evidence of multiple frequencies present and located near the main sequence turnoff .",

    "further exploration of parameter space may be necessary to fit these cool @xmath2 doradus candidates .",
    "alternatively , the variability for these four objects can result from rapid rotation coupled with unstable spot patterns on the surface .",
