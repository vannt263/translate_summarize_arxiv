    ", one needs to employ nonperturbative tecniques .    in this work we concentrate on mesons that can be described as strongly - bound states of one quark and one antiquark .",
    "the physics of mesons is a very active field of research , especially due to the vast amount of data currently being collected in experimental facilities such as the lhc , babar , belle , and cleo . in the near future",
    ", exciting results are also expected from jefferson lab ( gluex ) and fair ( panda).theoretical predictions are therefore important not only to guide the identification of new states  some of them with exotic non-@xmath0 content @xcite  but also to calculate other observables , such as form factors , decay rates , etc . , important for the study of the structure of mesons .    in the recent years , lattice qcd approaches have made impressive progress , providing us with a large amount of valuable predictions for physical observables  @xcite . at the same time , non - perturbative continuum methods ( for a good review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) have attracted attention with their potential of providing a deeper understanding of qcd in the infrared regime from information that can not be extracted from lattice data alone . very recently ,",
    "hamiltonian approaches with a phenomenological confinement obtained from light - front holographic qcd  @xcite and renormalization - group procedures for effective particles  @xcite have been used to study heavy quarkonium .",
    "our approach , the covariant spectator theory ( cst )  @xcite , is close in spirit to the dyson - schwinger/ bethe - salpeter ( dsbs ) formalism  @xcite .",
    "they both aim at a quantum - field - theoretical description where the one- and two - body dynamics are treated self - consistently . unlike dsbs , cst works directly in minkowski space .",
    "in addition , the two - body cst equation sums the infinite series of all ladder and crossed - ladder exchange diagrams more efficiently than the ladder bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) , due to important cancellations that occur when the mass of one of the constituent particles becomes large .",
    "it has been proven that , in a scalar theory and in the limit of the heavy mass tending to infinity , these cancellations even become exact , and that the cst equation therefore gives the exact result ( for more details , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "further virtues of the cst worth mentioning include :    * meson wave functions are given in terms of covariant vertex functions which have simple transformation properties under lorentz boosts .",
    "* cst equations are manifestly covariant , but nevertheless require only three - dimensional loop integrations . *",
    "the two - body cst equation reduces in the one - body limit to the dirac equation , and in the nonrelativistic limit to the schdinger equation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec:2 ] we introduce the formalism , in section  [ sec:3 ] we present the results and discussion , and in section [ sec:4 ] we conclude with a summary and an outlook .",
    "in order to derive the cst set of equations we start with the bse for the quark - antiquark vertex function @xmath1 with an irreducible interaction kernel @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the total four - momentum , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the external and internal relative four - momenta , respectively .",
    "the bse is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the dressed quark propagator depending on the individual four - momentum @xmath8 of quark @xmath9 .",
    "in the cst , the heavier quark , say quark 1 with mass @xmath10 , is on - mass - shell .",
    "this yields the cst equation for the vertex function @xmath11 , where 1cs `` or 1cse '' stands for one - channel spectator equation @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the 1cse results from the bse by keeping in the @xmath12-contour integration only the contribution from the residue of the positive - energy pole of the quark @xmath13 propagator .",
    "when all quark pole contributions are included in the @xmath12-contour integration this leads to a coupled set of cst equations , depicted diagrammatically in fig.[fig ] . for the heavy and heavy - light systems the 1cse is a good approximation  @xcite , as it retains the most important properties of the complete set of cst equations , i.e. manifest covariance , cluster separability , and the correct one - body and nonrelativistic limits .",
    "it is also a good approximation for equal - mass particles , as long as the bound - state mass is large and of the order of the sum of the quark masses .",
    "however , a property the 1cse does not maintain , in general , is charge - conjugation symmetry .",
    "therefore , states calculated with the 1cse are not expected to be c - parity eigenstates . in principle , this problem is easily remedied by using the set of two - channel cst equations inside the dashed rectangle of fig.[fig ] instead .",
    "the 1cse reads @xmath14 where @xmath15 or @xmath16 ; @xmath17 describes the momentum dependence of the kernel labelled @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the mass of quark @xmath9 , and @xmath20 .",
    "a `` @xmath21 '' over a four - momentum indicates that it is on - mass - shell .",
    "the kernel employed in our calculations with the 1cse consists of a covariant generalization of the linear ( l ) confining potential used in @xcite , a color coulomb ( coul ) , and a constant ( c ) interaction : @xmath22v_\\mathrm{l }   -\\gamma^\\mu_1 \\otimes \\gamma_{\\mu 2 } \\left [ v_\\mathrm{coul}+v_\\mathrm{c } \\right]\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : kernel}\\ ] ] the mixing parameter @xmath23 allows to dial between a scalar - plus - pseudoscalar structure , which preserves chiral symmetry as shown in  @xcite , and a vector structure , while leaving the nonrelativistic limit unchanged .",
    "the precise lorentz structure of the confining interaction is not known , and by fitting the @xmath23 parameter from the mesonic mass spectra , further information can be gained .",
    "early results favored pure scalar - plus - pseudoscalar confinement , and therefore we set @xmath24 in this work .",
    "the momentum - dependent structures of the interaction kernel are @xmath25,\\ ] ] @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "the three coupling strengths , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , are free parameters of the model .",
    "an analysis of the asymptotic behaviour for large momenta @xmath5 shows that we need to regularize the kernel .",
    "we use pauli - villars regularization for both the linear and the coulomb parts , which yields one additional parameter , the cut - off parameter @xmath31 .",
    "the results turn out not to be very sensitive to the choice of @xmath31 and we set @xmath32 .",
    "next we expand both the projector and the propagator of eq.([eq:1cs ] ) in terms of @xmath33-spinors ( @xmath34 ) , defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 are two - component spinors . introducing the notation @xmath37 for the spinor matrix elements of the interaction vertices and of the vertex function , respectively , we obtain @xmath38 multiplying eq .",
    "( [ eq:1cse3 ] ) from the left by @xmath39 and from the right by @xmath40 yields @xmath41 introducing the cst wave functions when quark 1 is on - shell , @xmath42 we can finally cast eq.([eq:1cs ] ) into the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",

    "this is remarkable , because pseudoscalar states ( the only ones used in the fit of model p1 ) are essentially pure @xmath60-waves and are not sensitive to spin - orbit and tensor forces .",
    "moreover , in pseudoscalar mesons the spin - spin forces act only in spin - singlet states and therefore can not be separated from the central forces .",
    "this means that no information about the spin - dependent interactions was used to constrain the kernel of model p1 . on the other hand , the scalar and vector states",
    "to which model psv1 was fitted _ are _ sensitive to the spin - dependent interactions and do constrain its parameters .",
    "the fact that both fits give essentially the same parameters and rms differences to the data means that the spin - dependent interactions are _ correctly predicted _ by the covariant kernel of model p1 .",

    "as expected , the relativistic components are tiny in heavy mesons , but become larger as the constituent quark masses decrease , reaching almost 10% for @xmath55 mesons , the lightest systems considered here .",
    "the momentum - space wave functions tend to be more spread out for heavier states , and as one decreases the mass of the lighter quark , the wave functions concentrate more in the region of low momenta .",
