    ", galaxy - galaxy lensing has been detected with high precision using various data sets , most of which contain millions of foreground - background galaxy pairs .",
    "these high - precision detections have allowed direct constraints to be placed on the nature of the dark matter haloes that surround the lens galaxies , as well as on the bias between mass and light in the universe ( see , e.g. , fischer et al .",

    "in other words , observations of galaxy - galaxy lensing by field galaxies have yielded a picture of luminous galaxies and their dark matter haloes that is broadly consistent with the expectations of galaxy formation in the context of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model .    despite the popularity of the spherically - averaged nfw density profile ,",
    "cdm haloes are not spherical .",
    "rather , cdm haloes are triaxial and the degree of flattening increases with halo viral mass ( e.g. , warren et al .",

    ", galaxy - galaxy lensing should be able to provide constraints on the shapes of the dark matter haloes of field galaxies , since a non - spherical weak lens will produce an anisotropic shear pattern .",
    "consider an isolated weak galaxy lens with a non - spherical dark matter halo ( i.e. , a halo that , in projection on the sky , has an elliptical surface mass density ) .",
    "for fixed source redshift and fixed angular distance from the lens , sources that are located closer to the major axis of the lens will experience greater shear than sources that are located closer to the minor axis of the lens .",
    "if the halo of the lens can be approximated as a singular isothermal ellipsoid with projected ellipticity @xmath6 , the shear experienced by sources nearest the minor axis of the lens will be @xmath7% that of the shear experienced by sources nearest the major axis of the lens ( see , e.g. , brainerd & blandford 2002 ) .",
    "although small , such an anisotropy in the galaxy - galaxy lensing signal should be observable provided that , in projection on the sky , mass and light are reasonably well aligned within the lens galaxies .",
    "weak lensing by galaxy clusters in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; e.g. , abazajian et al .",

    "( 2007 ) restricted their analysis to elliptical galaxies , the mean halo ellipticity and the significance of the result was found to increase somewhat .",
    "here we construct a series of monte carlo simulations in order to explore the theory of weak galaxy - galaxy lensing by non - spherical dark matter haloes . using these simulations",
    "we demonstrate that , in practice , it is challenging to _ interpret _ the results of an observational effort to detect anisotropic galaxy - galaxy lensing .",
    "this is because , in general , the observed signature of anisotropic galaxy - galaxy lensing is strongly affected by the fact that the central , `` lens '' galaxies have , themselves been weakly lensed . as a result , the observed symmetry axes of the central , lens galaxies differ from their intrinsic symmetry axes . in our work below we pay particular attention to the effects of multiple weak deflections on the galaxy - galaxy lensing signal . as was first pointed out by bbs ,",
    "galaxy - galaxy lensing is inherently a multiple deflection problem .",
    "that is , it is common for a source galaxy located at redshift @xmath18 to be weakly lensed by a galaxy located at @xmath19 .",
    "oftentimes these two galaxies are then subsequently lensed by another galaxy at redshift @xmath20 .",
    "in other words , the galaxy at @xmath21 serves simultaneously as a lens for the galaxy at @xmath18 and a source for the galaxy at @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , the galaxy at @xmath18 is lensed by two different foreground galaxies . neglecting such multiple deflections when modeling an observed galaxy - galaxy lensing signal will give rise to incorrect conclusions about the underlying properties of the haloes of the lens galaxies . for a detailed discussion of the frequency and relative strengths of multiple deflections in a deep galaxy - galaxy lensing data set ,",
    "the reader is referred to brainerd ( 2010 ) .    below , the haloes of the lens galaxies will be modeled as truncated singular isothermal ellipsoids .",
    "this choice is motivated by two considerations .",
    "firstly , the singular isothermal ellipsoid gives rise to a gravitational lensing shear that can be computed analytically ( e.g. , kormann , schneider & bartelmann 1994 ) .",
    "secondly , at the present time the observational galaxy - galaxy lensing data are not of sufficiently high quality to allow one to distinguish between singular isothermal ellipsoid haloes and those that are triaxial cdm haloes .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the basic theory of gravitational lensing by singular isothermal ellipsoids and we introduce a shorthand notation that we will use throughout the paper . in section 3",
    "we outline the construction of monte carlo simulations of galaxy - galaxy lensing by non - spherical haloes , where the locations and apparent magnitudes of the monte carlo galaxies are taken from a large observational data set . in section 4",
    "we present the signature of galaxy - galaxy lensing by non - spherical haloes that one should expect to obtain from a realistic observational data set . in section 5",
    "we explore the effects of galaxy - galaxy lensing on the images of relatively nearby galaxies ( i.e. , galaxies that are ordinarily be considered to be `` lenses '' but are not always considered to be `` sources '' ) . in section 6",
    "we construct a second suite of monte carlo simulations in order to determine the effect of multiple weak deflections on observations of anisotropic galaxy - galaxy lensing . in section 7",
    "we demonstrate that the effects of lensing of foreground galaxies on the observed signature of anisotropic galaxy - galaxy lensing can not be eliminated by selective rejection of either lens or source galaxies .",
    "we summarize our results and present our conclusions in section 8 .",
    "throughout , we will refer to the weak lensing of a background galaxy by a single foreground galaxy as a `` deflection '' , and we will adopt a flat @xmath23-dominated cosmology with @xmath24  km  sec@xmath25  mpc@xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "let us assume that the dark matter haloes of large , luminous galaxies may be fairly represented as truncated singular isothermal ellipsoids . since we are only concerned with the weak lensing regime , the adoption of a halo model that is singular ( as opposed to a model with a finite density core ) will have no effect on our results below .",
    "following kormann et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , the surface mass densities of the dark matter haloes are given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the line of sight velocity dispersion , @xmath30 is the axis ratio of the mass distribution as projected on the sky ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 is the truncation radius , @xmath33 is newton s constant , and @xmath34 is a generalized elliptical radius defined such that @xmath35 .",
    "here @xmath36 and @xmath37 are cartesian coordinates measured , respectively , along the minor and major axes of the projected mass distribution of the halo . in the limiting case of a round lens ( i.e. , @xmath38 ) , the total mass of the halo becomes @xmath39    the convergence ( @xmath40 ) and shear ( @xmath41 ) are the characteristic properties of a gravitational lens . in the case of truncated singular isothermal ellipsoid lenses ,",
    "the convergence is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the critical surface mass density , @xmath44 is the angular diameter distance of the lens , @xmath45 is the angular diameter distance of the source and @xmath46 is the angular diameter distance between the lens and the source",
    ". the real and imaginary components of the shear can be obtained straightforwardly from equations ( 63abc ) of kormann et al .",

    "again , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are cartesian coordinates measured along the minor and major axes of the lens , respectively . in order to maintain consistency with the notation of kormann et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , here we have used a polar coordinate system , centred on the lens , with radial coordinate @xmath49 and polar angle , @xmath50 , defined such that @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "it is clear from equations ( 4 ) through ( 6 ) that , unlike a circularly symmetric lens for which the magnitude of the shear depends upon the angular distance from the lens centre but not the azimuthal coordinate of the source , the shear due to an elliptical lens is a function of both the angular distance from the lens centre as well as the azimuthal coordinate of the source . at a given angular distance , @xmath53 , from the centre of an elliptical lens ,",
    "the magnitude of the shear is greatest for sources located nearest the major axis of the lens and least for sources located nearest the minor axis of the lens .",
    "hence , within a given radial annulus that is centred on the elliptical lens , sources whose azimuthal coordinates , @xmath50 , place them within @xmath54 of the major axis of the lens will experience a greater mean shear than sources whose azimuthal coordinates , @xmath50 , place them within @xmath54 of the minor axis of the lens . as a shorthand notation",
    ", we will refer to the magnitude of the mean shear experienced by sources whose azimuthal coordinates place them within @xmath54 of the minor axis of an elliptical lens as @xmath55 .",
    "similarly , we will refer to the magnitude of the mean shear experienced by sources whose azimuthal coordinates place them within @xmath54 of the major axis of an elliptical lens as @xmath56 ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "to quantify the effects of non - spherical dark matter haloes on the galaxy - galaxy lensing signal , we construct a series of monte carlo simulations . as a starting point for our simulations",
    "we use a set of modestly - deep , wide - field @xmath57-band images that were were generously donated to us by emilio falco .",
    "the images were obtained as part of the btc40 survey ( monier et al .",
    "2002 ) , which was carried out using the big throughput camera ( btc , tyson et al .  1992 ; wittman et al .",
    "1998 ) on the 4 m blanco telescope at the cerro - tololo interamerican observatory .",
    "the @xmath57-band exposures consist of 150 seconds per pointing , and each individual image covers an area of order one - quarter of a square degree .",
    "we selected a total of 13.8  deg@xmath58 of imaging data from the survey for our work , rejecting images that were obtained during poor photometric conditions or which exhibited poor tracking or poor focus .",
    "the data were calibrated , flat - fielded , and de - fringed as described in monier et al .",
    "object catalogs were created from the reduced @xmath57-band data using the sextractor package ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "additional details regarding the quality of the imaging , star - galaxy separation , cosmic ray rejection , point - spread function correction , and masking of cosmetic defects ( e.g. , large stellar blooms , diffraction spikes ) will be presented in a companion paper ( howell & brainerd , in preparation ) . in the companion paper",
    "we will also present an analysis of the observed galaxy - galaxy lensing signal in this data set .",
    "for the purposes of our present study , we are simply interested in using the btc40 galaxies as the framework for a set of monte carlo simulations of galaxy - galaxy lensing by non - spherical haloes .",
    "that is , here we will address the following question : given a data set like that obtained from the btc40 , what should one expect to observe for the galaxy - galaxy lensing signal if the dark matter haloes of the galaxies are non - spherical ?",
    "the information from the btc40 images that we use here consists solely of the centroids of the galaxies and their @xmath57-band apparent magnitudes .",
    "these , along with other quantities , are used as input parameters for our monte carlo simulations . also ,",
    "in order to ultimately match the data that will be presented in our companion paper , here we use only btc40 galaxies with @xmath59 . while the completeness limit of the data is somewhat fainter than @xmath60 , in practice the btc40 galaxies with @xmath61 are too small for accurate shape determinations .",
    "the observed shapes of the btc40 galaxies have been affected by the presence of a spatially - varying anisotropic point spread function .",
    "because of this , and because of the fact that shape determinations become increasingly noisy at faint flux levels , we do not use the observed shapes of the btc40 galaxies in our monte carlo simulations . instead ,",
    "in order to describe the shape of the luminous galaxy , each monte carlo galaxy is assigned an intrinsic image ellipticity , @xmath62 , that is drawn from the probability distribution derived by ebbels ( 1998 ) from 94 archival hst field survey images : @xmath63 .",

    "we assume that the projected shapes of the haloes of the btc40 galaxies are elliptical but , unlike hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and mandelbaum et al .",
    "( 2006b ) , we do not assume that there is a linear relationship between the shape of the luminous galaxy and the shape of its projected dark matter halo .",
    "while the assumption @xmath68 may have some validity for elliptical galaxies , it is definitely false for disk galaxies ( which make up a substantial fraction of the lens population )",
    ". agustsson & brainerd ( 2006 ) showed that the observed ellipticities of disk galaxies embedded within cdm haloes were largely uncorrelated with the ellipticities of their projected haloes ( see their figure  6 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that one always views a random projection of the dark matter halo on the sky .",
    "therefore , a high inclination angle for the disk ( which maximises the ellipticity of the luminous galaxy image ) does not , in general , correlate with a projection that maximises the projected ellipticity of the halo . in order to assign projected axis ratios , @xmath30 , to the haloes of our monte carlo galaxies ,",
    "then , we use the probability distribution obtained by agustsson & brainerd ( 2006 ) for the projected axis ratios of cdm galaxy haloes . the halo of each galaxy in our simulations is therefore assigned a value of @xmath30 that is drawn at random from this distribution ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "+    next we must make a choice as to how to orient the luminous galaxies within their dark matter haloes .",
    "the only symmetry axes that can be used in an observational data set to detect anisotropic galaxy - galaxy lensing are , of course , the symmetry axes of the luminous galaxies themselves .",
    "if mass and light are not reasonably well aligned within the lens galaxies , a detection of anisotropic galaxy - galaxy lensing is hopeless since we can not directly observe the orientations of the symmetry axes of the dark matter haloes .",
    "therefore , in our simulations we will assume that the intrinsic symmetry axes of the luminous galaxies and their dark matter haloes are aligned with each other .",
    "this assumption maximises the degree of anisotropy in the galaxy - galaxy lensing signal that one should expect to see and it presents a best case scenario for detecting the effect .",
    "neither spectroscopic redshifts nor photometric redshifts are available for the btc40 galaxies .",
    "therefore , we must assign redshifts to the galaxies in order to carry out our monte carlo simulations .",
    "following the prescriptions of bbs and wright ( 2002 ) , we adopt a redshift distribution of the form @xmath69}{\\gamma(3/\\beta ) z_0 ^ 3 } .",

    "( 1996 ) and lefvre et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and we then have @xmath71 .\\ ] ]",
    "lastly , we must assign velocity dispersions and truncation radii to the haloes of each of the monte carlo galaxies . to do this",
    ", we assume that the galaxies follow a faber - jackson or tully - fisher type of relationship and have constant mass - to - light ratio ( see , e.g. , bbs ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion , @xmath29 , of the halo of a galaxy with luminosity , @xmath72 , is then given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the velocity dispersion of the halo of an @xmath75 galaxy .",
    "the truncation radius , @xmath32 , of the halo of a galaxy with luminosity , @xmath72 , is given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the truncation radius of the halo of an @xmath75 galaxy .",
    "the luminosity of each monte carlo galaxy is obtained from its observed @xmath57-band apparent magnitude and the redshift , @xmath78 , that was assigned to the galaxy based on equation ( [ zdist ] ) above .",
    "accounting for the k - correction , we have @xmath79 where @xmath80 ( e.g. , bbs ) . for simplicity , we take @xmath81 , which is the mean slope of the spectral energy distribution between the johnson @xmath82-band and @xmath83-band from the caltech faint galaxy redshift survey ( cohen et al .",
    "1999ab ) .    for each monte carlo simulation",
    "then :    * a pair of characteristic parameters , @xmath84 , are adopted for the haloes of @xmath75 galaxies * each luminous galaxy is assigned its observed location on the image , as well as its observed @xmath57-band apparent magnitude * the image of each luminous galaxy is assigned an intrinsic shape , @xmath62 , using equation ( [ edist ] ) and its dark matter halo is assigned an axis ratio , @xmath30 , drawn from the projected halo shapes in agustsson & brainerd ( 2006 ) * each luminous galaxy is assigned a random intrinsic position angle , @xmath85 , ( i.e. , we assume that in the absence of gravitational lensing the galaxy images are uncorrelated ) and , since we also assume that mass and light are aligned in projection on the sky , the projected halo is assigned a position angle identical to the position angle of the unlensed luminous galaxy * each galaxy is assigned a redshift , @xmath78 , using equation ( [ zdist ] ) , and its luminosity relative to @xmath75 is obtained using equation ( [ luminosity ] ) * the dark matter halo of each galaxy is assigned a velocity dispersion , @xmath29 , and truncation radius , @xmath32 , based upon the luminosity of the galaxy within the halo and the scaling relations of equations ( [ veldisp ] ) and ( [ trunc ] )    each monte carlo simulation then proceeds by computing the weak lensing shear , @xmath86 , that is induced as light rays emanating from distant galaxies encounter the gravitational potentials of foreground galaxies .",
    "as we will see below , most of the distant galaxies with redshift @xmath87 are lensed by numerous foreground galaxies with redshifts @xmath88 .",
    "we define the intrinsic ( unlensed ) shape of each luminous monte carlo galaxy to be @xmath89 where @xmath90 in the intrinsic ( unlensed ) ellipticity of the galaxy image and @xmath85 is the intrinsic ( unlensed ) position angle .",
    "since we are dealing with the weak lensing regime , all lensing events may be considered to be independent ( e.g. , bartelmann & schneider 2001 ) and the final image shape of each lensed galaxy is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the shear induced by foreground lens galaxy , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 is the net shear due to all foreground lenses .",
    "the real ( @xmath95 ) and imaginary ( @xmath96 ) components of the shear are given by equations ( 4 ) through ( 6 ) above .",
    "computation of the net shear for each of the galaxies due to literally _ all _ potential foreground lens galaxies is extremely time - consuming and , from a practical standpoint , is unnecessary since foreground lenses that induce negligible shear ( say , @xmath97 ) can be neglected in comparison to foreground lenses that induce substantial shear ( say , @xmath98 ) . from brainerd ( 2010 ) , we know that source galaxies with a median redshift @xmath99 that have been lensed by a population of foreground galaxies with @xmath100 experience little shear due to lenses that are located at projected radii @xmath101 . scaling to the btc40 galaxies , we find that for @xmath102 the contribution to the net galaxy - galaxy lensing shear will be negligible .",
    "hence , in our monte carlo simulations we compute the net shear experienced by each btc40 galaxy due to all foreground galaxies that are located within a projected radius of @xmath103 , and we do not include any contribution to the net shear from lenses located at projected radii @xmath104 .    in the next section we will analyse the output of our monte carlo simulations in a manner that is similar to the way in which an observational galaxy - galaxy lensing data set is analysed . in the case",
    "that neither spectroscopic nor photometric redshifts are available for an observational data set ( as is the case for the btc40 data ) , one can make only a crude distinction between `` foreground '' and `` background '' galaxies using apparent magnitudes . from the probability distribution above ,",
    "we know that , on average , galaxies with bright apparent magnitudes tend to be located at lower redshifts than galaxies with faint apparent magnitudes ( though there is certainly a good deal of overlap ) .",
    "if we consider galaxies with @xmath105 , we find a median redshift of @xmath106 for our btc40 sample .",
    "if we consider galaxies with @xmath107 , we find a mean redshift of @xmath108 for our btc40 sample .",
    "these magnitude cuts therefore yield a rough division of our btc40 sample into 38,879 `` bright '' foreground ( @xmath105 ) objects and 225,518 `` faint '' background ( @xmath107 ) objects .",
    "the redshift distributions adopted for these objects are shown figure  3 .",
    "+    it is important to remember that in the monte carlo simulations , all galaxies with redshifts @xmath87 have been lensed by all other galaxies with redshifts @xmath88 that are located within a projected radius @xmath109 of the galaxy at redshift @xmath87 .",
    "we illustrate this in figure  4 , where we show an example of a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the image corresponds to a single ccd frame from the btc40 survey ( 0.25  deg @xmath110 0.25  deg ) , where the dots indicate the locations of galaxies with magnitudes @xmath59 and the lines indicate the directions on the sky of objects that have lensed the galaxies .",
    "that is , each line indicates the presence of a lens - source pair in the data ; however , for clarity of the figure we do not extend the lines to connect every source galaxy directly to all of its lenses .",
    "brown dots show the locations of bright , foreground galaxies ( @xmath105 ) and blue dots show the locations of faint , background galaxies ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "blue lines indicate that the lens is a faint , background galaxy .",
    "brown lines indicate that the lens is a bright , foreground galaxy .",
    "therefore , a blue line originating from a blue dot indicates that a faint , background galaxy has been lensed by another faint , background galaxy .",
    "similarly , a brown line originating from a blue dot indicates that a faint , background galaxy has been lensed by a bright , foreground galaxy .",
    "importantly , figure  4 shows that virtually all of the bright , foreground galaxies ( the brown dots ) have , themselves , been lensed multiple times .",
    "most of the bright , foreground galaxies have been lensed by other bright galaxies but they are occasionally lensed by a faint galaxy ( due to the overlapping redshift distributions of these objects ) .",
    "the majority of the lenses turn out to be faint galaxies simply because there are @xmath111 times as many faint galaxies per unit area as there are bright galaxies .",
    "+    it is clear from figure  4 that the vast majority of the galaxies have been lensed by more than one galaxy ; that is , multiple deflections are common for all of the galaxies in the monte carlo simulations .",
    "this statement is true independent of the values of the characteristic parameters adopted for the haloes of @xmath75 galaxies , @xmath112 ; however , the relative strengths of the individual deflections and their net effect on @xmath113 for each galaxy will , of course , be a strong function of the values of the characteristic parameters that are adopted ( see , e.g. , brainerd 2010 ) .",
    "here we use the output of the btc40 monte carlo simulations to compute the dependence of the mean tangential shear of the faint ( @xmath107 ) galaxies using the bright ( @xmath105 ) galaxies as the centres for the calculation .",
    "that is , we compute the signature of galaxy - galaxy lensing in the same way as is done for an observational data set in which apparent magnitude is used as the sole discriminator between `` foreground '' and `` background '' objects .",
    "we separately compute @xmath114 and @xmath115 , and we show the results in figures  5 - 7 for three different sets of characteristic parameters that were chosen to represent the haloes of @xmath75 galaxies . since galaxy - galaxy lensing is relatively insensitive to the radii of the dark matter haloes ( e.g. , bbs ; hoekstra et al .  2004 ; brainerd 2010 ) , we adopt a value of @xmath116  kpc for the haloes of @xmath75 galaxies . in figures  5 - 7",
    "we then vary the characteristic velocity dispersion , adopting values of @xmath117  km  sec@xmath25 ( figure  5 ) , @xmath118  km  sec@xmath25 ( figure  6 ) , and @xmath119  km  sec@xmath25 ( figure  7 ) .",
    "+    in order compute @xmath120 and @xmath121 we must first define what we mean by the symmetry axes of the bright galaxies .",
    "implicit in our definition of @xmath56 and @xmath55 is that the intrinsic ( unlensed ) symmetry axes are the symmetry axes of the projected dark matter halo ( e.g. , figure  1 ) .",
    "however , observers are not blessed with `` dark matter glasses '' that allow us to see the intrinsic symmetry axes . rather",
    ", in an observational data set , we must take the symmetry axes of the bright galaxies to be their _ observed _ symmetry axes , not their intrinsic symmetry axes .",
    "this is an important distinction since the observed symmetry axes of the bright galaxies may have been altered due to weak lensing by foreground galaxies ; see , e.g. , figure  4 .    in figures  5 - 7",
    "we compute @xmath120 and @xmath121 using both the observed symmetry axes ( circles ) and the intrinsic symmetry axes ( crosses ) of the bright , central galaxies .",
    "that is , the circles indicate the functions that we would expect to measure in an observational data set , while the crosses indicate the functions that we would obtain if we were able to observe the intrinsic ( unlensed ) symmetry axes of the bright , central galaxies . in the case of very low mass lenses",
    "( figure  5 ) , there is relatively little difference between the tangential shears that result from using the observed symmetry axes of the bright centres and those that result from using the intrinsic symmetry axes .",

    "that is , the observed signature of anisotropic galaxy - galaxy lensing by haloes of moderate mass is largely consistent with isotropic galaxy - galaxy lensing on scales @xmath124 . in the case of @xmath119  km",
    "sec@xmath25 , the observed function is actually _ reversed _ from the expected function ( i.e. , @xmath125 ) on scales @xmath126 .",
    "that is , the observed signature of anisotropic galaxy - galaxy lensing by high mass haloes could lead one to think ( falsely ) that mass and light are anti - aligned within the galaxies .",

    "in addition , an observation of @xmath125 is _ not categoric proof that mass and light are anti - aligned within the lens galaxies _ since the intrinsic symmetry axes of the luminous galaxies in the monte carlo simulations were taken to be aligned with the symmetry axes of their projected dark matter haloes .",
    "since we have allowed the bright , central galaxies that we have used to compute @xmath114 and @xmath115 to be lensed by foreground galaxies , the circles in figure  8 show the actual signature of galaxy - galaxy lensing by non - spherical dark matter haloes that one should expect to see in an observational data set ( i.e. , a data set in which the galaxies are all broadly distributed in redshift space ) .",
    "contrary to the usual expectation that @xmath114 should exceed @xmath115 over a wide range of angular scales , figure  8 shows that this is unlikely to be the case unless the haloes of @xmath75 galaxies have particularly low characteristic velocity dispersions ( @xmath117  km  sec@xmath25 ) . in section 6",
    "we will demonstrate that the results shown in figure  8 are caused primarily by the fact the observed symmetry axes of the bright , foreground centres have been altered from their intrinsic symmetry axes by weak lensing .",
    "figures  9 and 10 show schematic illustrations of what can occur in the situation that a given lens - source pair is , itself , lensed by a foreground mass .",
    "consider an intrinsically circular source galaxy that is located near the major axis of an elliptical lens galaxy .",
    "that is , the lens - source pair is in what one might call the `` @xmath128 configuration '' . after being sheared by the elliptical lens ,",
    "the image of the source galaxy is an ellipse with the major axis of its image oriented tangentially with respect to the major axis of the elliptical lens .",
    "this is illustrated by the blue ellipse in the top and bottom panels of figure  9 .",
    "now consider the effect on the image of the intrinsically circular source if a large mass ( i.e. , another galaxy ) is placed in the foreground of the original lens - source pair .",
    "if the additional foreground mass is located along the line that connects the centroids of the original lens - source pair , the net result for the image of the intrinsically - circular source is that it becomes _ more elliptical _ than if it had been lensed only once .",

    "now consider the effect if the foreground mass is placed such that its location is tangential to the line that connects the centroids of the original lens - source pair .",
    "the net result for the image of the intrinsically - circular source is that it will be _ less elliptical _ than if it had been lensed only once .",
    "this is illustrated by the red ellipse in the bottom panel of figure  9 .",
    "we see , therefore , that the inclusion of a second lens may either increase or decrease the net ellipticity of our distant , circular source over what we would have naively expected in the single - deflection case .",
    "+    0.5 cm    next let us consider the fact that not only will the introduction of an additional foreground mass alter the image of the distant , circular source galaxy , it will also alter the image of the original elliptical lens galaxy .",
    "again , consider the original lens - source pair to be in the @xmath128 configuration . if the foreground mass is placed along the line that connects the centroids of the original lens - source pair , the image of the elliptical lens becomes rounder than its intrinsic shape ( i.e. , since it is distorted tangentially with respect to the location of the foreground mass ) . in some finite number of cases where the intrinsic ellipticity of the image of the elliptical lens is very small and",
    "the shear due to the foreground lens is large , the post - lensing image of the elliptical lens may even have its observed symmetry axes reversed from its intrinsic symmetry axes . as a result , the distant , intrinsically circular source galaxy would appear to be in the @xmath129 configuration when , in fact , it is in the @xmath128 configuration ( e.g. , top panel of figure  10 ) .",
    "should the situation illustrated in the top panel of figure  10 occur , the mean tangential shear that one would obtain for sources located close to the _ observed minor axes _ of the elliptical lens will be greater than it ought to be .",
    "that is , the observed value of @xmath129 is boosted by the incorrect inclusion of sources that would have properly gone into the calculation of @xmath128 if one had known the orientation of the intrinsic symmetry axes of the elliptical lens .",
    "of course , this also results in the observed value of @xmath128 being reduced compared to its true value because the observed lens - source configuration has been `` misclassified '' compared to its intrinsic configuration .",
    "+    0.5 cm    next consider placing the foreground mass along a line that is tangential to the line that connects the centroids of the original lens - source pair .",
    "if the original lens - source pair is in the @xmath128 configuration , the image of the elliptical lens will have an increased ellipticity after being lensed by the foreground mass and it will not undergo a reversal of its symmetry axes ( i.e. , the lens - source pair remains in the @xmath56 configuration ) , but the final image of the source will be less elliptical than it would have been in the absence of the foreground lens . in the case that the lens - source pair is intrinsically in the @xmath129 configuration , however , a finite number of lenses with small intrinsic ellipticities may have their symmetry axes reversed by lensing due to the foreground mass ( e.g. , bottom panel of figure  10 ) .",
    "hence , the original lens - source pair would appear to be in the @xmath128 configuration , when , in fact , it is actually in the @xmath129 configuration . in this case , the intrinsically circular source is incorrectly put into the calculation of @xmath128 , and its net shear will be rather small because : ( i ) it is , in reality , located near the minor axis of the elliptical lens and ( ii ) after being lensed by the additional foreground mass , its image will be rounder than if it had been lensed solely by the original elliptical lens . both of these conspire to reduce the observed value of @xmath128 compared to its true value .    based upon relatively simple reasoning from figures  9 and 10",
    ", we may therefore expect that multiple deflections ( i.e. , the presence of more than one foreground lens ) could lead to a suppression of @xmath3 compared to what would would obtain if one knew the intrinsic symmetry axes of the bright centres .",
    "one might hope that in a sufficiently large data set the effects of foreground lenses on the original elliptical lens - source pair would cancel each other out .",
    "however , this is not necessarily going to be the case .",
    "galaxies span a broad range of redshifts ; hence , at fixed angular separation from a source , @xmath53 , two foreground lens galaxies with identical gravitational potentials will have different lensing strengths because they are located at different physical distances from the source . in the following sections we will explore the effect of galaxy - galaxy lensing on the images of the bright , foreground objects that are used as centres for the computation of the mean tangential shear of the faint , background objects .",
    "in addition , we will explore the effect of weak lensing of the central galaxies on the measured values of @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "all of our monte carlo galaxies with redshifts @xmath87 have been lensed by all other monte carlo galaxies with redshifts @xmath88 that are found within a radius of @xmath103 of the galaxy at @xmath87 .",
    "since the redshift distribution of the galaxies is broad , this means that many of the bright centres ( i.e. , those btc40 galaxies with @xmath132 ) correspond to galaxies that have , themselves , been lensed ( e.g. , figure  4 ) . at a given angular separation from a weak galaxy lens , galaxy - galaxy lensing may be considered to be a scalar shear .",
    "that is , although a source galaxy has a finite size on the sky , the shear due to a foreground weak galaxy lens is effectively constant across the image of the source . shown in figure  11",
    "is an illustration of the transformation of an ellipse ( i.e. , the intrinsic shape of a galaxy ) due to a scalar shear . the important things to note from this figure are that a scalar shear applied to an ellipse results in a change in the ellipticity as well as a change in the position angle .",
    "in addition , the original major and minor axes of the ellipse are no longer orthogonal after the transformation .     +    in the limit that the intrinsic ellipticity , @xmath62 , of an ellipse is large compared to the applied shear , @xmath133 , the transformation of the ellipse due to a scalar shear can be obtained straightforwardly from equations ( 39 ) and ( 40 ) of surpi & harari ( 1999 ) .",
    "let the ellipse have intrinsic axis ratio @xmath134 and intrinsic position angle @xmath135 . if we then take @xmath136 to be the angle between the major axis of the unlensed source ellipse and the vector that connects the centroids of the lens and the source ellipse , the resulting change in position angle of the source ellipse is @xmath137 and the square of the axis ratio of the transformed source ellipse",
    "is given by @xmath138 figure  12 shows the resulting change in position angle and ellipticity for ellipses with intrinsic ellipticity @xmath139 due to a 1% scalar shear ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "unsurprisingly , the smaller is @xmath90 , the greater is the change in position angle , and the maximum change in the position angle occurs for @xmath141 .",
    "in addition , the smaller is @xmath90 , the greater is the change in ellipticity .",
    "the maximum change in ellipticity occurs for the two extreme conditions : @xmath142 , resulting in an ellipse that is rounder than its intrinsic shape , and @xmath143 , resulting in an ellipse that is flatter than its intrinsic shape .",
    "in the previous section we demonstrated that , in the limit of small intrinsic ellipticities , the images of the galaxies that correspond to the `` bright centres '' in our galaxy - galaxy lensing analysis could be significantly affected by weak lensing by foreground galaxies under the right circumstances . that is , multiple weak deflections ( in which a lens - source pair is subsequently lensed by one or more foreground galaxies ) will affect not only the image of the original source , but they will also affect the image of the original lens . in this section",
    "we investigate the effect of such multiple weak deflections on measurements of @xmath130 and @xmath131 . here",
    "we wish to separate the effects of weak lensing due to non - spherical dark matter haloes from the effects of subsequent multiple weak deflections due to the haloes of foreground galaxies . to address this",
    ", we construct a set of constrained monte carlo simulations in which a lens - source pair that contains an elliptical lens is , itself , weakly - lensed by additional galaxies whose dark matter haloes are spherically - symmetric .",

    "an elliptical lens of fixed mass axis ratio , @xmath30 , is placed at the origin of the coordinate system . here",
    "@xmath30 is the axis ratio of the projected dark matter halo .",
    "the elliptical lens is assigned a random position angle and a redshift , @xmath144 , drawn from the redshift distribution adopted for the btc40 objects with apparent magnitudes @xmath105 .",
    "the elliptical lens is assigned an intrinsic , luminous galaxy shape drawn from equation ( 7 ) above , and the intrinsic position angle of the luminous lens galaxy is taken to be the position angle of its dark matter halo .",
    "a source galaxy is placed randomly along the horizontal axis of the coordinate system , such that it lies within a distance of @xmath145 of the elliptical lens .",
    "the source galaxy is assigned a fixed redshift , @xmath146 .",
    "next , a circle of radius @xmath147 , centred on the elliptical lens , is populated with additional galaxy lenses whose haloes are taken to be singular isothermal spheres ( sis ) .",
    "the number density of the sis lenses is matched to the observed number density of galaxies with apparent magnitudes @xmath105 in the btc40 data , and they are assigned random locations within the field . each sis lens is assigned a redshift based upon its apparent magnitude , again drawn from our adopted probability distribution .",
    "the elliptical lens is assigned a velocity dispersion , @xmath29 , and truncation radius , @xmath32 . for simplicity",
    ", the sis lenses are assigned a velocity dispersion equal to the velocity dispersion that is assigned to the elliptical lens . having assigned positions , redshifts , and gravitational potentials to all of the lenses , then ,",
    "the net shear experienced by the source is computed as the sum of the individual shears due to all lenses ( elliptical and sis ) with redshifts @xmath148 .",
    "in addition , the final image shape of the lens galaxy residing within the elliptical dark matter halo is computed using the net shear due to all foreground sis lenses ( i.e. , sis lenses with @xmath149 ) .",
    "the above procedure is repeated 20 million times for a fixed axis ratio , @xmath30 , of the halo of the elliptical lens , fixed values of @xmath29 and @xmath32 , and fixed source redshift , @xmath146 . for each new monte carlo realisation , a new intrinsic position angle and a new intrinsic image shape for the luminous galaxy within the elliptical lens halo",
    "are generated .",
    "that is , with each new realisation we randomly `` spin '' the elliptical lens and we assign its luminous galaxy a new intrinsic ellipticity .",
    "in addition , the elliptical lens is assigned a new redshift in each new realisation .",
    "thus , after many realisations , the redshifts of the elliptical lenses will span the entire range of redshift space that was adopted for btc40 galaxies with @xmath105 . for each new monte carlo realisation a new location for the source along the horizontal axis",

    "the symmetry axes used for the calculation are the intrinsic symmetry axes of the central elliptical lens . comparing the crosses to the circles we find that the introduction of foreground sis lenses does little to affect the ratio of the tangential shears when the intrinsic symmetry axes of the central elliptical lens are used for the calculation .    the squares in figures  13 - 15 show @xmath3 for the case that the source galaxies are lensed by both the central elliptical lens , as well as all foreground sis lenses .",
    "in addition , the central , elliptical lens has been lensed by all foreground sis lenses . here",
    "the symmetry axes used for the calculation are the _ observed _ symmetry axes of the central elliptical lens ( i.e. , the symmetry axes after lensing by the foreground sis lenses ) . from figures  13 - 15 , the degree to which the observed function , @xmath2 , is suppressed compared to what one would obtain using the intrinsic symmetry axes of the elliptical lens is a function of the velocity dispersion that is adopted .",
    "the lower is the velocity dispersion of the lenses , the less the observed function is suppressed .",
    "this is due to the fact that the frequency and strength of the multiple weak deflections are lower for lenses with low velocity dispersions than for lenses with high velocity dispersions ( see , e.g. , brainerd 2010 ) .",
    "in contrast , the ellipticity of the projected dark matter halo of the central elliptical lens has relatively little effect on the degree to which the observed function , @xmath3 is suppressed .",
    "( note that the vertical scales in figures  13 - 15 are very different from each other due to the fact that the more elliptical is the central elliptical lens , the greater is the anisotropy that it induces . )",
    "in an attempt to `` inoculate '' one s analysis of galaxy - galaxy lensing by non - spherical haloes against the above effects , one might consider simply rejecting bright centres with small image ellipticities from the calculation of @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "that is , one could hope to avoid the extreme situation where a lens - source pair that is truly in the `` @xmath56 '' configuration is swapped to the `` @xmath55 '' configuration due to the ellipticity of the image of the lens being very small ( and , hence , making it more susceptible to having its symmetry axes altered significantly by weak lensing due to foreground galaxies ) .",
    "naively , one might hope that the suppression of the observed function , @xmath2 , could be eliminated simply by choosing to compute the mean tangential shear using bright centres whose images are highly elliptical .",
    "in addition , in a search for the signature of anisotropic galaxy - galaxy lensing , one might be tempted to restrict the analysis to source galaxies that are very close to the symmetry axes of the bright centres that are used to calculate the mean tangential shear .",
    "that is , in all of the analyses above , @xmath130 and @xmath131 were computed using all sources whose azimuthal coordinates , @xmath50 , placed them within @xmath54 of the symmetry axes of the bright centres . at fixed angular separation from an elliptical lens , the maximal difference in the shear experienced by two sources will , of course , occur when one source is located along the minor axis of the lens and the other is located along the major axis of the lens .",
    "therefore , one might expect that if one narrowed the analysis region from @xmath54 to , say , @xmath161 or @xmath162 , it would be easier to detect anisotropic galaxy - galaxy lensing .    unfortunately , the situation is not that simple in either of these cases .",
    "weak lensing of the bright centres may make their resulting images either rounder or more elliptical than their intrinsic image shape ( i.e. , bottom panel of figure  12 ) .",
    "suppose that one chooses a minimum image ellipticity for the bright centres , and that the computation of @xmath120 and @xmath121 is performed using only those bright centres with observed ellipticity @xmath163 .",
    "some fraction of the bright centres whose intrinsic ellipticity truly exceeds @xmath164 will , by weak lensing by foreground galaxies , have their resulting images made rounder than their intrinsic ellipticity . as a result",
    ", some bright centres with intrinsic ellipticities that are larger than @xmath164 will , in fact , be rejected on because their observed ( post - lensing ) images have ellipticities smaller than @xmath164 .",
    "the number of such bright centres that are affected by this will vary with the magnitude of the shear that they experience .",
    "in addition to changing the ellipticity , weak lensing of the bright centres may rotate the orientations of their symmetry axes ( i.e. , top panel of figure  12 ) .",
    "if one simply tries to narrow one s analysis region relative to the symmetry axes of the bright centres , a problem will occur if the bright centres have been weakly lensed .",
    "any rotation of the symmetry axes of the bright centres causes the analysis region that one truly desires ( i.e. , the region that brackets the directions of the major and minor axes of the projected halo mass ) to be rotated with respect to the analysis region that one must actually use in practice ( i.e. , the region that brackets the directions of the observed major and minor axes of the image of the bright centre ) .",

    "we conclude , therefore , that in order to properly interpret any observed galaxy - galaxy lensing signal ( be it isotropic or anisotropic ) , it is vital that full , multiple - deflection monte carlo simulations be used .",
    "especially important is accounting for the fact that the images of the bright , foreground centres are likely to have been weakly lensed . if the effects of multiple deflections are not taken into account when interpreting an observed galaxy - galaxy lensing signal , there is a high probability that incorrect conclusions will be drawn about the nature of the haloes surrounding the lens galaxies .",

    "<S> the observed ratio of the mean tangential shears may be consistent with an isotropic signal ( despite the fact that the lenses are non - spherical ) , or it may even be reversed from the expected signal ( i.e. , the mean tangential shear for sources close to the observed minor axes of the lenses may exceed the mean tangential shear for sources close to the observed major axes of the lenses ) . </S>",
    "<S> these effects are caused primarily by the fact that the images of the lens galaxies have , themselves , been lensed and therefore the observed symmetry axes of the lens galaxies differ from their intrinsic symmetry axes . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the effects of lensing of the foreground galaxies on the observed function @xmath3 can not be eliminated simply by the rejection of foreground galaxies with very small image ellipticities , nor by simply focusing the analysis on sources that are located very close to the observed symmetry axes of the foreground galaxies . </S>",
