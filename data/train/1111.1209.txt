    "blazars are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) hosting supermassive black holes , with relativistic jets pointing along the line of sight to the observer .",
    "the small viewing angle of the jet makes it possible to observe strong relativistic effects , such as a boosting of the emitted power and a shortening of the characteristic time scales .",
    "blazars are typically identified through radio and optical surveys , being radio loudness , flat spectrum and compact morphology in the radio band , some degree of optical polarization , and fast , large amplitude variability their defining observational characteristics .",
    "close to the galactic plane ( @xmath3 ) , diffuse radio emission and confusion with local radio sources make candidate blazars difficult to select .",
    "heavy optical extinction due to interstellar dust @xcite further complicates spectroscopical identification of blazars at low latitudes .",
    "these observational challenges give us only a fragmentary knowledge of the blazar population in the galactic plane a region .",

    "gamma - rays do not suffer from significant absorption at low galactic latitudes .",
    "even if the gamma - ray diffuse emission is brighter close to the galactic plane , observations in the gamma - ray band have shown to be a successful tool to identify blazars located behind the galactic plane , which are heavily absorbed at other wavelengths .",

    "it combines a large effective area over a wide range of energies ( 100gev to 30tev ) with an energy resolution of 15 - 25% and an angular resolution of less that @xmath5 .",

    "rx  j0648.7 + 1516 is a rosat - detected x - ray source associated with a compact flat - spectrum radio source @xcite , located @xmath6 off of the galactic plane .",
    "having the typical characteristics of a radio - loud agn , no definitive optical identification was found in the literature , with several unsuccessful attempts to find an optical counterpart @xcite . _ fermi_-lat discovered a gamma - ray source associated with rx  j0648.7 + 1516 @xcite .",
    "the source was identified as a promising vhe candidate by the _",
    "fermi_-lat collaboration , and this information triggered veritas observations of the source .",
    "rx  j0648.7 + 1516 was observed with veritas between 4 march and 15 april 2010 ( mjd 55259 - 55301 ) , for a total exposure of 19.3 hours after rejecting data taking under poor weather conditions or with hardware problems . after event parameterization and background rejection ,",
    "an excess of 283 gamma - ray - like events from the direction of rx  j0648.7 + 1516 was found , corresponding to a significance of @xmath7 .",
    "figure  [ fig:0648-gamma ] shows the differential energy spectrum of the obtained signal , which can be parametrized by a power law of the form @xmath8 with @xmath9 @xmath10s@xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the excess event distribution of the signal is consistent with a point - like source and compatible within errors with the radio position of rx  j0648.7 + 1516 .",
    "a vhe light curve in 1-day bins does not show significant variability during veritas observations .",
    "the detection in the vhe band strongly suggests the source being a blazar , since most of the vhe - detected agns are of the blazar class . to test that hypothesis ,",
    "optical spectroscopy measurements were triggered after the veritas detection .",
    "two spectra were obtained with the kast double spectrograph on the 3-meter shane telescope at the uco / lick observatory ( see figure  [ fig:0648-opt ] ) .",
    "the optical spectrum shows ca h+k , g - band , na i and mg i spectral absorption features , compatible with the source being at a redshift of @xmath13 .",
    "these observations also provide a definitive optical identification of rx  j0648.7 + 1516 as a blazar .",
    "the fact that the absorption lines have equivalent widths @xmath14 indicate a blazar of the bl lac sub - class .",
    "after the public release of the 1st year of data accumulated by _ fermi _ , an analysis of the photons with highest energies collected by _ fermi_-lat was carried out inside the veritas collaboration in order to look for vhe gamma - ray candidates . in particular , photons with @xmath15gev recorded by _",
    "fermi_-lat during its first year of operations were binned in an all - sky map ( figure  [ fig : map ] ) .",

    "one of the few previously undetected hotspots was less than @xmath16 away from rgb  j0521.8 + 2112 : a radio - loud agn with significant x - ray emission located @xmath17 off of the galactic plane .",
    "veritas observations centered at the position of rgb  j0521.8 + 2112 were taken between 22 and 24 october 2009 ( mjd 55126 - 55128 ) , leading to the detection of a new vhe gamma - ray source : ver  j0521 + 211 @xcite .",
    "an excess with significance of @xmath18 was obtained during the first 230 minutes of exposure .",
    "veritas continued monitoring the new gamma - ray source and detected a high flux state in 22 november 2009 ( mjd 55157 ) , when ver  j0521 + 211 reached a peak flux @xmath19 times brighter than the discovery observations @xcite .",
    "a total exposure of 14.5 hours was selected integrating all the data accumulated between 22 october 2009 and 16 january 2010 ( mjd 55126 - 55212 ) , after rejecting data taken under poor weather conditions , or with hardware problems .",
    "a signal with significance of @xmath20 was obtained .",
    "the excess distribution of ver  j0521 + 211 is consistent with a point - like source and its location compatible with the radio position of rgb  j0521.8 + 2112 .",

    "there was no obvious affiliation for rgb  j0521.8 + 2112 prior to the veritas detection , other than rgb sources being generally radio - loud agns @xcite .",
    "gamma - ray loudness in agns is typically interpreted as doppler - boosted emission from a relativistic jet closely oriented towards the line of sight to the observer .",
    "therefore , the vhe detection of ver  j0521 + 211 strongly suggests a blazar - type agn .",
    "most vhe - detected agn are blazars ( 43 out of 47 ) , with the only exceptions being nearby fri radio galaxies . following the vhe detection , optical spectroscopy observations where performed at the 6.5-meter mmt telescope at the flwo .",

    "the successful identification of rx  j0648.7 + 1516 and ver  j0521 + 211 through their gamma - ray emission suggests that vhe observations can be a useful tool to identify blazars at low galactic latitudes , where classical blazar surveys conducted in the radio and optical bands suffer from source confusion and optical extinction .",
