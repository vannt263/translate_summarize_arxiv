    "ongoing radial - velocity surveys have uncovered @xmath7 exo - solar giant planets .",
    "their orbital characteristics are puzzling : many have eccentricities much higher than the planetary orbits in our solar system , and a large fraction reside very close to the host star .",
    "these orbits indicate either a formation scenario different from that which operated in our solar system , or a migration mechanism to bring the planets in from large distances .",
    "the object hd @xmath6b ( naef , latham & mayor , @xcite , hereafter nlm , period @xmath8 days , @xmath9 ) is a g5 star with [ fe / h ] @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . ]",
    "the focus of this article , has the highest eccentricity ( @xmath13 ) and the smallest pericentre distance ( @xmath14 ) among all known exo - planet candidates .",
    "is it possible to form such a system in - situ ? among the spectroscopic binaries contained in the batten catalog ( batten , fletcher & maccarthy @xcite ) , the only g - type binary that has a comparably small periastron distance ( @xmath15 ) is hd 27935 ( griffin , griffin & gunn , @xcite ) with @xmath16 .",
    "duquennoy , mayor & andersen ( @xcite ) reported a more eccentric system , the k - dwarf binary gl 586a , with @xmath17 and a periastron distance of @xmath18 .",
    "however , doubts exist as to whether the latter binary can be primordial . but assuming both systems are primordial , their presence empirically suggests that hd @xmath6b might have formed as a binary companion to hd @xmath6 .",
    "this hypothesis is currently untestable , the more so since the projected mass - ratio in this system is rather extreme .",
    "instead we ask the following question : can hd @xmath6b be formed in the cool outer part of a protoplanetary disk and then evolve into the current orbit via migration ?",
    "planet - planet scattering is one such possibility , assuming hd @xmath6 had or has multiple planets .",
    "ford , havlikova & rasio ( @xcite ) integrated the evolution of @xmath19 two - planet systems that are initially dynamically unstable .",
    "not a single close encounter produces a planet with @xmath20 .",
    "this rarity leads us to conclude that either the orbits of most observed exo - planets are results of planet - planet scattering , or that the hd @xmath6 system is not the result of such scattering .",
    "the leading hypothesis for planet migration involves gravitational interactions between the planets and the gas disks out of which they form ( goldreich & tremaine @xcite ; lin , bodenheimer & richardson @xcite ) . under certain circumstances planet - disk interactions",
    "may also excite the orbital eccentricity of the planet ( see , e.g. , goldreich & sari @xcite ) .",
    "if so , this may explain the orbital separation and eccentricity of the bulk of the systems discovered so far .",
    "these systems exhibit an eccentricity distribution that is roughly flat below @xmath21 and distinctly drops off around @xmath22 .",
    "it is believed that jupiter - mass planets can open up gaps in their natal gas disks with a fractional width @xmath23 reaching up to a similar value .",
    "this coincidence suggests that passage of an eccentric planet through the disk on either side of the gap tends to damp the planet s orbital eccentricity and to limit the maximum eccentricity planet - disk interaction produces to @xmath24 .",
    "however , hd @xmath0 stands out with @xmath1 .",
    "the origin of the orbit of hd @xmath6b becomes more perplexing if we consider tidal effects .",
    "assuming that the planet has a tidal dissipation efficiency similar to other known exo - planets ( quality factor @xmath25 , wu @xcite ) or to jupiter ( goldreich & soter @xcite , peale & greenberg @xcite ) and setting its true mass equal to the minimum mass , its radius to a jupiter radius , we find that a mere @xmath26 myrs ago , hd @xmath6b had an implausibly high eccentricity of @xmath27 .",
    "the age of the system is likely to be this old or older ; the stellar projected rotational velocity is low , @xmath28 , typical of old g - dwarves ; it is also chromospherically quiet .",
    "interestingly , there is a neighbor to this system , hd @xmath29 , a main - sequence companion @xmath30 au away .",
    "this prompts us to develop a theory in which the companion is responsible for the high eccentricity and small orbit of the planet .",
    "there are two ingredients in our theory .",
    "first , we assume that the planet was born on an orbit of a few au , and had an orbital plane inclined relative to the stellar binary plane .",
    "the remote stellar companion would induce an eccentricity oscillation in the planet s orbit via the kozai mechanism ( kozai@xcite ; see also discussions by holman , touma & tremaine @xcite , innanen , zheng , & mikkola , @xcite , and mazeh , krymolowski & rosenfeld @xcite ) .",
    "the second component is tidal circularization .",
    "the tides operate most effectively during episodes of high eccentricity in the kozai cycle .",
    "we rely on the dissipative tidal process to irreversibly draw the planet inward . combining the two processes",
    ", we can explain the current high eccentricity as well as the tight orbit .",
    "we refer to this planet migration scenario as ` kozai migration ' .",
    "eggleton , kiseleva & hut ( @xcite ) , kiseleva , eggleton & mikola ( @xcite ) , and eggleton & kiseleva - eggleton ( @xcite , eke hereafter ) , have developed this scenario to explain some hierarchical triple star systems .",
    "blaes , lee & socrates ( @xcite ) applied an analogous scheme ( gravitational radiation being the dissipation mechanism ) to hierarchical triple black holes in galactic centers . in this article",
    ", we adopt the formalism of eke in an attempt to produce a plausible life - history for hd @xmath6b (  [ sec : hd80606 ] ) .",
    "the story depends on the value of the tidal quality factor @xmath31 (  [ subsec : qvalues ] ) .",
    "the observational consequences of such a life - history follow in  [ subsec : secondplanet ] . in  [ subsec : tidalheight ] we discuss the tidal velocities induced at the stellar photosphere by the highly eccentric planet , and the possibility of observing such tides .",
    "nlm note the presence of substantial residuals to the keplerian fit in the hd @xmath6 system .",
    "the tidal velocities appear to be large , but not large enough to explain the observed velocity residuals .",
    "lastly (  [ subsec : othersystem ] ) , we assess the importance of kozai migration for other planetary systems where binary companions are also known to exist .",
    "the host star of hd @xmath6b is known to be a member of a common proper - motion binary with a companion ( hd @xmath29 ) that is similar to hd @xmath6 in both spectral type and metallicity .",
    "the two stars are separated by @xmath32 on the sky .",
    "unfortunately , it is hard to translate this into a linear dimension .",
    "the hipparcos distances for both stars are highly uncertain mas for hd @xmath6 and @xmath33 for hd @xmath34 .",
    "the large error bars are presumably due to mutual contamination ( see also nlm ) . ]",
    "this complicates an age determination with isochrone fitting .",
    "but if we enforce the constraint that the stars have reached the main - sequence , isochrone fitting yields a lower limit of @xmath35 pc on the distance , implying a projected binary separation of @xmath36 au at the current epoch",
    ". on the other extreme , requiring that the stars have not yet ascended the red giant branch yields a maximum distance of @xmath37 pc , and a projected separation of @xmath38 au . as noted above , the low @xmath39 and the chromospheric quietness of hd @xmath6 are typical of an old g - dwarf . in this article",
    ", we adopt a value of @xmath3 au for the binary semi - major axis ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the eccentricity is taken to be @xmath41 . and",
    "@xmath42 , respectively . ]",
    "we discuss the effects on the kozai migration when @xmath40 is increased . even at such a large distance , the companion star could significantly perturb the planet orbit as long as the two orbital planes are initially inclined to each other more than @xmath43",
    ". secular effects of the kozai type could then occur and produce large cyclic variations in the planet s eccentricity ( @xmath44 ) and relative inclination , as a result of angular momentum exchange with the companion orbit .",
    "effects on the companion orbit produced by the planet can be neglected , given the extreme ratio in the two orbits angular momenta ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) . under this approximation ,",
    "the z - component of the planet s angular momentum , @xmath47 , is conserved . here",
    "the z - axis is normal to the companion plane .",
    "as @xmath48 is not modified by secular perturbations , the kozai integral @xmath49 is conserved during the oscillations .",
    "minima in @xmath44 concur with maxima in @xmath50 , and _",
    "vice versa_. each kozai cycle lasts a time @xmath51 , or a few myrs .    a much slower process , tidal circularization , gradually removes energy from the orbit and draws the planet inward . an initially more highly inclined orbit ( larger @xmath50 )",
    "could reach higher eccentricity . and",
    "since the dissipation process depends sensitively on the nearest approach distance between hd @xmath6b and its host star , such an orbit would suffer stronger orbital decay and have shorter migration timescale .",
    "the key issue in kozai migration is therefore the initial value of @xmath50 . in ",
    "[ subsec : heuristic ] , we first estimate the minimum initial inclination required for migrating hd @xmath6b from an initial orbit of @xmath52 au and an initial eccentricity of @xmath53 , we then confirm this estimate numerically in  [ subsec : numerical ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : symbol ]      to estimate the minimum initial inclination , we note that while the kozai oscillation roughly conserves @xmath54 and @xmath48 during individual cycles , tidal circularization preserves orbital angular momentum ( @xmath55 ) during episodes of maximum eccentricity .",
    "the planetary spin is quickly ( pseudo-)synchronized with the orbital motion , while the star s synchronization time greatly exceeds the orbital circularization time .",
    "hence the planet s orbital angular momentum can not be absorbed into spin . since @xmath56 near maximum , conservation of @xmath57 translates into a constant periastron distance between maximum @xmath44 during the kozai cycles . in an orbit with a semi - major axis of @xmath4 au ,",
    "hd @xmath6b would have to reach an eccentricity as high as @xmath58 ( at some point during the kozai cycle ) in order to produce the currently observed periastron . adopting a minimum of @xmath59 during the kozai cycles ( see , e.g. , holman , @xcite ) , the kozai integral ( @xmath54 ) remaining constant yields @xmath60 for an initial @xmath61 .",
    "in other words , the two orbits had to be virtually perpendicular to each other when the planet formed .",
    "this conclusion is independent of the companion orbital separation .",
    "the planet in hd @xmath6b is not currently undergoing kozai oscillations ; the kozai mechanism operated only when the planet had a semi - major axis @xmath62 au . to see why , note that the torque exerted by the companion star on the planet has its value and direction dependent on the pericentre argument of the planet ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "if , however , this argument also precesses under other forces , the averaged kozai torque is reduced .",
    "general relativistic effects , tidal effects , and rotational quadrapolar bulges on the planet are mainly responsible for these extra precession .",
    "their rates are summarized here ( sterne @xcite , einstein @xcite ) , with definitions for the symbols listed in table 1 . ,    @xmath64    taking a kozai precession rate of @xmath65 ( holman , @xcite ) , and assuming that the planet is pseudo - synchronously spinning with the orbit ( @xmath53 ) , the relative precession rates are , @xmath66 if any of the above ratios exceeds unity , the kozai oscillation is destroyed . setting the first ratio to unity",
    ", we obtain a suppression radius @xmath67 au . currently , the kozai oscillations are strongly suppressed by these extra precessions",
    ". this conclusion does not affect the minimum inclination required for kozai migration .",
    "however , the suppression radius does depend on the companion separation : e.g. , it is reduced to @xmath68au if the companion semi - major axis is as small as @xmath69 au .",
    "we adopt the set of equations ( eq .",
    "[ 11]-[17 ] ) in eke ( also see eggleton , kiseleva & hut @xcite ) to describe the secular evolution of the planet orbit , as well as the spin of the host star and the planet .",
    "any change in the companion s orbit is ignored .",
    "physical effects described by these equations include : secular interactions , gr , tidal and rotational precession , and tidal dissipation .",
    "these equations are explicitly listed in appendix [ sec : ekeeqn ] .",
    "we integrate equations - starting from the following initial conditions : planet orbit @xmath70 au , @xmath53 , relative inclination @xmath71 ( slightly higher than the @xmath72 estimate in  [ subsec : heuristic ] because the actual minimum inclination is @xmath73 , not @xmath74 as we assumed ) , and periapse angle @xmath75 .",
    "values of the system parameters are listed in table 1 .",
    "the resulting orbital and spin information are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : eggleton_short ] as functions of time .",
    "initially , the planet undergoes kozai oscillation with each cycle lasting @xmath76 myrs .",
    "whenever @xmath44 evolves close to maximum , a small amount of energy ( but not angular momentum ) is removed from the orbit .",
    "both @xmath48 and @xmath44 are decreased , while @xmath77 remains roughly constant .",
    "this corresponds to a small kick to reduce @xmath44 whenever @xmath78 ( see fig . 3 of holman @xcite ) .",
    "the kozai integral slowly increases .",
    "this explains why the amplitude of @xmath44 oscillation shrink as the planet migrates inward ( top - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : eggleton_short ] ) .",
    "after about @xmath79 gyrs , the planet has reached an orbit with @xmath80 au , and the kozai oscillation is completely destroyed by gr precession . at this epoch",
    ", we find @xmath81 and @xmath82 . from this point on ,",
    "tidal circularization dominates the evolution , and the influence of the binary companion is negligible .",
    "the planet reaches an orbit of @xmath83 and @xmath84 au @xmath85 gyrs after its birth .",
    "a few notes are in order .",
    "we adopt a value of @xmath86 for the planet , and @xmath87 for the host star .",
    "we discuss the reasons for these choices in  [ subsec : qvalues ] . using them ,",
    "the planet s spin reaches synchronicity with the orbital frequency near periastron almost instantly , while the star s spin is hardly affected by tides ( see lower - right plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : eggleton_short ] ) .",
    "tidal circularization is dominated by dissipation in the planet over that in the star by a factor of @xmath88 .",
    "most of the dissipation , which conserves orbital angular momentum , occurs when the planet has been driven to maximum eccentricity by the companion star .",
    "the results do not depend on the value for the longitude of the ascending node .",
    "this is because in the quadrapole approximation for secular interactions , the companion orbit is effectively taken to be circular so there is no preferred axis in the binary plane .",
    "this also explains why the vertical angular momentum of the planet orbit ( kozai integral ) is conserved ",
    "there is a rotational invariance with respect to the @xmath89 axis .",
    "the results also do not depend on the value for the argument of pericentre , @xmath63 .",
    "kozai oscillations can cause either circulation or libration in the value of @xmath63 .",
    "3 of holman ( @xcite ) shows that the circulating solutions can reach higher @xmath44 and therefore should lead to shorter evolutionary timescale .",
    "however , for the initial conditions we adopted , the circulating and librating solutions essentially coincide and give rise to similar values for the maximum eccentricity .",
    "to migrate the planet from a distance larger than @xmath4au , one requires a higher minimum inclination so as to reach the same pericentre distance at maximum eccentricity . in comparison , this inclination hardly varies when the initial eccentricity of the planet is varied from @xmath90 to @xmath22 , this can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : eggleton_short ] .",
    "lastly , if the companion is further away than @xmath3 au , each kozai cycle lasts longer , and it takes a longer time for the planet to migrate to its current location . for instance , placing the companion at @xmath91 au , we find the planet should now be @xmath92gyrs old .",
    "a time - dependent tide raised on a celestial body , due to either its asynchronous rotation ( asynchronous tide ) or its eccentric movement ( eccentricity tide ) , can be dissipated , leading to synchronous spin or orbital circularization .",
    "the rate of dissipation is conventionally described by a dimensionless quality factor @xmath31 , the ratio between the energy in the tidal bulge and the energy dissipated per orbital period . for equilibrium tides , @xmath31 is related to the lag - angle between the tide - inducing object and the tidal bulge @xmath93 by @xmath94 .",
    "it is possible to adapt the @xmath31 description to dynamical tides , in which case the tidal energy refers to the energy in the ( non - existent ) equilibrium tidal bulge , and @xmath31 is obtained from the dissipation averaged over a range of tidal frequencies .",
    "back - reaction to the orbits by the gravitational moments of the tidal waves is ignored , a procedure strictly justifiable only when the damping time of the waves is shorter than the orbital period .",
    "however , secular effects of the tidal dissipation should be independent of this back - reaction .",
    "@xmath31 value has been estimated to be @xmath95 , with the actual value believed to be closer to the lower limit ( goldreich & soter @xcite , peale & greenberg @xcite ) , based on the resonant configuration of the galilean satellites . the physical origin of this @xmath31 value has remained elusive for a few decades .",

    "value of the host stars .",
    "the stars are typically slowly rotating so their tidal dissipation have the effects of both circularizing and eroding the planet orbit .",
    "this would fail to produce the observed circular orbits , if it is more important than dissipation in the planets .",
    "] this is striking as the exo - solar planets have different thermal environments , formation histories , and possibly interior compositions , than those of jupiter .",
    "the similar @xmath31 values provide an important clue as to the underlying dissipation mechanism .",
    "moreover , while the @xmath31 factor for jupiter pertains to the asynchronous tide , the one for exo - planets concerns the eccentricity tide .",
    "one may speculate that the quality factors for the different jovian - mass objects agree because all the objects rotate fast with periods comparable to or shorter than the tidal period .",
    "tidal dissipation in the host star of hd @xmath6b also contributes to circularization .",
    "what is the tidal @xmath31 factor appropriate for solar - type stars ?",
    "field solar - type binaries are observed to be circularized out to @xmath97 day orbits ( duquennoy & mayor @xcite ) .",
    "this would imply @xmath98 adopting an age of @xmath4 gyrs .",
    "these binary stars have presumably been synchronized , so this @xmath31 value is affiliated with dissipation of the eccentricity tide in rapidly spinning objects ( @xmath99 ) . for the evolution of planet orbits ,",
    "the @xmath31 value of relevance is that for the asynchronous tide in slowly rotating objects to which most host stars belong ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "it is not clear that @xmath99 is directly related to @xmath101 .",
    "what observational constraints could we put on @xmath101 ?",
    "short period planets can tidally spin up the star , at the cost of planetary orbital decay .",
    "assuming all host stars are sun - like and all exo - planets are jupiter - like , we obtain a lower limit of @xmath102 if all planets are to survive in their current orbit for another @xmath4 gyrs .",

    "taken at face value , this would imply @xmath105 .",
    "this contradicts our earlier statement that @xmath106 .",
    "these two results can be reconciled either by the imminent death of the shortest period planets , or by the possibility that @xmath103-boo has had only its surface convective layer synchronized with the orbit ( see goldreich & nicholson @xcite for a similar argument on massive stars ) .",
    "the latter possibility also makes it difficult to infer @xmath101 using the spin data of solar - type binaries .",
    "it is interesting to notice that among the three stars discussed by drake ( @xcite ) , @xmath103-boo likely has the thinnest convective envelope .",
    "unable to infer hard constraints on @xmath101 , we decide to adopt @xmath107 in our study . with this choice , dissipation in the planet",
    "is roughly @xmath108 times more important than dissipation in the star even for a planet as massive as @xmath109 .",
    "this choice has the advantage that unless the actual @xmath110 is much lower , the results presented here are not qualitatively affected .",
    "if there existed a second planet in the system , secular interaction between this planet and hd @xmath6b may destroy the kozai oscillations .",
    "kozai oscillations require that the precession caused by a second planet acting on hd @xmath6b s orbit be no larger than that produced by the companion star ( innanen , @xcite ) .",

[ [ eq : precession ] ] ) when @xmath52 au , we find that the mass of the second planet is constrained to a value that depends on its distance to hd @xmath6b .",

    "we consider one option : the tidal velocities induced by hd @xmath6b on the surface of the star .",
    "the stellar rotation is ignored in the following analysis .",
    "first , we assume that the star adjusts its hydrostatic equilibrium instantaneously according to the tidal potential of the planet at a radial separation @xmath131 ( the equilibrium tide picture ) , and estimate the corresponding tidal velocities .",
    "the maximum radial displacement at the stellar surface is roughly @xmath132 with the horizontal displacement being of a similar order .",
    "velocities associated with these displacements are simply estimated as @xmath133 , yielding a maximum line - of - sight velocity @xmath134 occurring within @xmath108 hours of the closest - encounter .",
    "this maximum requires conjunctions to coincide roughly with the line of periapse , as is the case in hd @xmath6 .",
    "we turn next to consider a more realistic description of the tidal amplitudes . the stellar response toward the time - varying potential is decomposed into a series of eigenmode oscillations , with the mode amplitudes maximized when the tidal forcing frequencies are in resonance with the mode frequencies ( the dynamical tide picture ) .",
    "if the planetary orbit is nearly circular , the dominant forcing frequency is @xmath135 . at an orbital period of @xmath136 days , this forcing resonantly excites gravity - modes of radial order @xmath30 .",

    "gravity - modes of radial orders @xmath139 become relevant and their resonant excitation give rise to much larger tidal velocities .",
    "a brief treatment of the dynamical tides is given in the appendix (  [ sec : dyntide ] ) .",
    "here we summarize our results .",
    "we adopt the standard solar model ( christensen - dalsgaard @xcite ) to calculate the eigenmode frequencies and damping rates .",
    "the response of the star depends sensitively on how close an orbital multiple lies around one such eigenmodes .",
    "the maximum response occurs when the frequency off - resonance ( @xmath140 ) is of order or smaller than the mode damping rate ( @xmath141 ) , giving rise to velocities of order @xmath108 to @xmath142 .",

    "this distinction suggests that planet migration in binaries may be induced differently from those around single stars , kozai migration being one such possibility . among the circled planets in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_period ] , we have only studied @xmath103-boo and 16 cygb .",
    "we found that @xmath103-boo , the most massive close - in planet , could have gone through kozai migration and later circularized , while there is no compelling evidence of kozai migration for 16 cygb , though it could currently be undergoing kozai oscillations ( holman ( @xcite ) .",
    "a binary companion may assist planet migration through other means , e.g. , exciting tidal waves in the proto - planetary disk and affecting angular momentum transport .",
    "these deserve further study .",
    "could some of the planets around currently single stars have undergone kozai migration followed by the subsequent disruption of the binary ?",
    "we consider this unlikely .",
    "the rate of kozai migration is limited by the tidal circularization process . for reasonable values of closest periapse distance",
    ", the latter process takes a few @xmath163 years or longer . by this age",
    "a typical stellar cluster has dispersed and the rate of stellar encounter has become negligible .",
    "however , it is possible that a planet s eccentricity was excited by kozai interaction with the binary companion before the latter was removed from the system . a simple estimate , however , finds that this may account for the observed eccentricity in at most @xmath164 of the known systems .",
    "it is striking that a companion star as remote as @xmath3 au can force a planet to migrate inward .",
    "kozai migration is a long timescale process and demands a clean planetary system in which no other planetary object exists .",
    "kozai migration can be responsible for the present orbit of hd @xmath6b only if the initial relative inclination is sufficiently high ( @xmath165 ) . assuming a population of similar triple systems with randomly distributed @xmath50 , @xmath166 of them could have gone through kozai migration .",
    "so on the strength of one object ( hd @xmath6b ) , one may speculate about the high density of triple stellar - planetary systems yet undetected .",
    "our prediction regarding the lack of a second planet in the system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gaussian_2ndplanet ] ) should be tested . in this regard ,",
    "we note the claim of the abnormally large residue velocities on the star .",
    "we investigated the possible association between these velocities and surface tidal waves excited by the highly eccentric planet .",
    "it seems unlikely that the latter can account for the former if the star has a structure like that of our sun . and",
    "if the system is indeed devoid of second planet , it raises issues as to how it is cleaned .",
    "zucker & mazeh ( @xcite ) pointed out that planets in binary systems and planets around single stars do not share the same period - mass distribution .",
    "the implications might be that binaries can cause planet migration  kozai migration being one of the more definite possibilities .",
    "hd @xmath6b s highly elongated orbit and strong tidal interaction combine to make it a possible target for direct detection .",
    "its current tidal luminosity ( which is likely to be converted into heat and radiated all through the orbit ) is @xmath167 , or @xmath168 mag dimmer than the parent star , at a maximum angular separation of @xmath169 ( assuming distance of @xmath170 pc ) .",
