    "landau s fermi - liquid ( fl ) theory@xcite can describe electronic properties of some correlated electron systems at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "in this theory , low - energy excitations are described by quasiparticles ( qps ) , i.e. electrons in a self - consistent field of surrounding electrons due to electron correlation .",
    "also , the interactions between qps , described by the landau parameters , are independent of temperature . due to these two properties ,",
    "the temperature dependences of physical quantities in low-@xmath4 region are governed by the temperature dependence of the fermi distribution function , and the corrections due to electron correlation , the mass enhancement and the fl correction , are independent of temperature . as a result ,",
    "thermodynamic or magnetic or transport quantities show the same temperature dependences as those of the free electron system in low-@xmath4 region , and the difference is the coefficient due to the mass enhancement or the fl correction or both .",
    "for example , the specific heat is proportional to @xmath4 , and the coefficient is renormalized by the mass enhancement ; the spin susceptibility is independent of temperature , and the coefficient is renormalized by the mass enhancement and the fl correction .",
    "the original landau phenomenological theory@xcite can be justified by microscopic perturbation theory with several imposed conditions@xcite .",
    "one of the basic assumptions , the one - to - one correspondence , becomes valid if the qp damping is much smaller than temperature considered ( i.e. , the qp lifetime , the inverse of the qp damping , is very long ) .",
    "actually , the single - particle spectral function near the fermi level becomes delta - function - type in the coherent limit [ i.e. , @xmath5 for all fermi momenta ] , @xmath6^{2}+\\gamma_{\\alpha}^{\\ast}(\\boldk)^{2 } } \\rightarrow     z_{\\alpha}(\\boldk)\\delta(\\epsilon-\\xi_{\\alpha}^{\\ast}(\\boldk)).\\label{eq : akw - fl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we consider only the coherent part , @xmath7 , where the self - energy is approximated as @xmath8 ; @xmath9 is @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the qp band index , @xmath12 is the qp energy , which is of the order of @xmath4 , @xmath13^{-1}$ ] is the inverse of the mass enhancement factor , and @xmath14 is the qp damping . since the delta - function - type spectral function is obtained for an exact eigenstate , the fl becomes an approximate eigenstate for momenta near the fermi level if the qp dampings at these momenta are much smaller than @xmath4 . in the fl theory",
    "the qp damping becomes small rapidly compared with decreasing temperature as a result of its @xmath15 dependence@xcite .",
    "in addition , the other basic assumption about the landau parameters becomes valid if the reducible four - point vertex functions and mass enhancement factor are independent of temperature@xcite .",
    "note , first , that the landau parameter is proportional to the product of the reducible four - point vertex function and the square root of the four mass enhancement factors@xcite ; second , that the four - point vertex function describes the multiple scattering of an electron and a hole@xcite ; third , that all reducible diagrams can be split into two parts by removing a pair of the single - particle green s functions , while all irreducible diagrams can not be done by using that removing@xcite .",
    "in contrast to successful description@xcite in the paramagnetic ( pm ) phase of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , landau s fl theory fails in describing electronic properties of other pm ruthenates near a magnetic quantum - critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "for example , in sr@xmath0ru@xmath2ti@xmath3o@xmath1 , located near an antiferromagnetic ( af ) qcp@xcite , the spin susceptibility shows the curie - weiss - like temperature dependence and the inplane resistivity , @xmath16 , shows the @xmath4-linear dependence@xcite , deviating from the fl - type @xmath15 dependence ; the characteristic wave vectors of this af qcp@xcite , @xmath17 and its symmetrically equivalent ones , are the same as the wave vectors of the most strongly enhanced spin fluctuation in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1@xcite . also ,",
    "in ca@xmath18sr@xmath19ruo@xmath1 around @xmath20 , located near a ferromagnetic qcp@xcite , the curie - weiss - like temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility and @xmath21 dependence of @xmath16 are observed@xcite .",
    "since such non - fl - like behaviors are observed in other systems near a magnetic qcp@xcite or a mott transition@xcite , where many - body effects generally become very important , these experimental facts@xcite indicate the necessity of both considering how the basic assumptions of landau s fl theory are violated and discussing many - body effects beyond landau s fl theory in a more elaborate theory .",
    "so far , there are two candidates for the origin of such non - fl - like behaviors .",
    "one is bad metal@xcite due to local correlation enhanced near a mott transition .",
    "if the low - energy excitations can be satisfactorily described by using only low - order taylor series of the self - energy in terms of frequency , the coherent part of the single - particle green s function plays dominant roles in discussing electronic properties .",
    "however , if there are some non - negligible contributions from the higher - order taylor series , the incoherent part also becomes important .",
    "such case is realized in a pm metallic phase near the mott transition due to the formation of the upper and lower hubbard peaks , arising from enhanced local correlation@xcite .",
    "since perturbation theory can treat the coherent part appropriately and its treatment of the incoherent part is insufficient@xcite , perturbation theory is unsuitable in the latter case . instead , the latter case can be well described in dynamical - mean - field theory ( dmft ) since the dmft can take account of the frequency dependence of the self - energy nonperturbatively@xcite .",
    "actually , several non - fl - like behaviors are obtained in the dmft near the mott transition as a result of the @xmath4-linear unrenormalized qp damping and the temperature - dependent mass enhancement factor@xcite . [ in this paper , i define the unrenormalized qp damping as the qp damping divided by the inverse of the mass enhancement factor . ]",
    "these results indicate the importance of nonperturbative effects of local correlation near the mott transition .",
    "note that hund s metal@xcite is classified as the bad metal since the non - fl - like behaviors in the hund s metal arise from local spin fluctuation enhanced near a mott transition , although there is a crucial difference between the hund s rule coupling dependence of the critical value of the intraorbital coulomb interaction for the mott transition at half - filling and non - half - filling@xcite .",
    "the other is nearly magnetic metal@xcite due to spatial correlation enhanced near a magnetic qcp .",
    "if a system is located far away from a magnetic qcp , all scattering processes are independent of temperature . however ,",
    "if the system approaches the qcp , several characteristic scattering processes of the qcp show the strong temperature - dependent enhancement@xcite .",
    "for example , in case near a stripe - type af qcp the scattering processes mediated by af spin fluctuations with @xmath22 and its symmetrically equivalent ones are strongly enhanced as decreasing temperature@xcite .",
    "such strong temperature - dependent enhancement leads to the strong temperature dependence of the reducible four - point vertex function whose momentum is characterized by the qcp .",
    "thus , the basic assumption of landau s fl theory about the landau parameters is violated only for the characteristic momenta of spin fluctuation enhanced near the qcp@xcite .",
    "also , the basic assumption about the qp damping is violated for the characteristic momenta due to the formation of hot spot , arising from enhanced spin fluctuation@xcite ; at the hot spot , the qp damping does not become much smaller than temperature considered . for example , in case near the stripe - type af qcp , the qp dampings at the momenta connected by the nesting vector @xmath22 and its symmetrically equivalent ones are more strongly enhanced than those at the other momenta due to the enhancement of the corresponding af spin fluctuations@xcite .",
    "these two violations suggest the necessity of discussing electronic properties near a magnetic qcp in the microscopic perturbation theory beyond landau s fl theory . actually , fluctuation - exchange ( flex ) approximation reproduces several non - fl - like behaviors due to the hot - spot structure of the qp damping or the curie - weiss - like temperature dependence of spin fluctuations or both@xcite . as explained in sect .",
    "2.3 , this approximation can take account of spatial correlation beyond a mean - field theory and describe electronic properties of a metallic phase at low temperatures for moderately strong electron correlation satisfactorily@xcite .",
    "in contrast to case near the mott transition , the dmft is inappropriate to describe electronic properties near a magnetic qcp since the dmft neglects spatial correlation completely@xcite .",
    "these results indicate powerfulness of the microscopic perturbation theory and the importance of temperature - dependent spatial correlation near a magnetic qcp .    with the backgrounds explained above , i studied electronic structure and magnetic and transport properties@xcite of ruthenates near and away from the af qcp in the flex approximation with current vertex corrections ( cvcs ) arising from the self - energy and maki - thompson ( mt)@xcite term for the @xmath23-orbital hubbard model on a square lattice and succeeded in reproducing several experimental results of sr@xmath0ru@xmath2ti@xmath3o@xmath1@xcite and sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1@xcite .",
    "thus , the non - fl - like behaviors@xcite in sr@xmath0ru@xmath2ti@xmath3o@xmath1 can be understood as the nearly magnetic meal near the af qcp .",
    "moreover , since the results away from the af qcp about the orbital dependence of the mass enhancement are in better agreement with the experiment@xcite in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 than those of the dmft@xcite , electronic properties of ruthenates at low temperatures except a few cases@xcite near the mott transition may be better described in the microscopic perturbation theory than in the dmft .    in this paper ,",
    "i review part of the above previous study@xcite and show some new results . in sect .",
    "2 , i explain the microscopic theory@xcite used for analyzing @xmath16 of some quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-@xmath24d ) pm ruthenates . in sect .",
    "3 , i show the results about many - body effects on @xmath16 of the ruthenates near and away from the af qcp in the flex approximation with the cvcs arising from the self - energy and mt term and compare these results with the results obtained in other cases where the cvcs are more simplified . in sect .",
    "4 , i summarize the results and draw some conclusions .    due to the limit of space ,",
    "i do not consider the aslamasov - larkin ( al ) cvc@xcite , which is the other cvc in the flex approximation ; its detailed derivation and effects are going to be discussed elsewhere@xcite .",
    "in this section , i explain an effective model of some quasi-@xmath24d ruthenates , briefly review the formal derivation of the resistivity of a multiorbital hubbard model in a pm metallic phase , and formulate the microscopic perturbation theory used to calculate the resistivity .",
    "the more detailed explanations about those derivation and formulation are going to be given elsewhere@xcite .    in the following ,",
    "i use the unit @xmath25 , set the coordinates @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 in the directions of the ru@xmath29o bonds of a ruo@xmath30 octahedral , and label the @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 orbitals as @xmath34 , @xmath24 , and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "i explain an effective model to describe electronic properties of some quasi-@xmath24d ruthenates without the rotation or the tilting of ruo@xmath30 octahedra@xcite .    before introducing the effective model ,",
    "i briefly explain several basic electronic properties .",
    "some ruthenates whose crystal structures are @xmath36-type such as sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1@xcite or @xmath37-type such as sr@xmath38ru@xmath0o@xmath39@xcite are categorized into quasi-@xmath24d @xmath23-orbital systems . for simplicity ,",
    "we focus on sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 ; the following properties remain qualitatively the same in other metallic ruthenates@xcite .",
    "first , the inplane resistivity is about @xmath40 times as small as the out - of - plane resistivity at low temperatures@xcite , and the almost cylindrical fermi surface ( fs ) is observed in the de haas - van alphen measurement@xcite .",
    "these indicate quasi-@xmath24d electronic conduction .",
    "moreover , according to several density - functional calculations@xcite in local - density approximation ( lda ) , conducting bands near the fermi level are formed by the antibonding bands of the ru @xmath23 and the o @xmath41 orbitals , and the @xmath23 orbitals mainly contribute to the density - of - states ( dos ) near the fermi level .",
    "since the topology of the fs obtained in the lda qualitatively agrees with experiments@xcite , the @xmath23 orbitals play dominant roles in discussing electronic properties at low temperatures .    with the above background",
    ", i assume that the electronic structure obtained in the lda@xcite for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is a good starting point to consider many - body effects beyond a mean - field approximation , and i use a @xmath23-orbital hubbard model on a square lattice as the effective model .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian is @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the energy dispersions , measuring from the chemical potential , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are intraorbital coulomb interaction , interorbital coulomb interaction , hund s rule coupling , and pair hopping term , @xmath51 is @xmath52 and @xmath53 is @xmath54 with the pauli matrices @xmath55 . since i do not consider the effects@xcite of the rotation and the tilting , we focus on electronic properties of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1@xcite and some doped sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1@xcite without these distortions .",
    "note that the rotation is present in ca@xmath18sr@xmath19ruo@xmath1 around @xmath20@xcite .",
    "whose parameters are chosen so as to reproduce the results in the lda@xmath56 for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1.,width=453 ]    by considering some symmetrically possible hopping processes and the difference between the crystalline - electric - field energies of the @xmath33 and @xmath57 orbitals , @xmath58 , we can construct the tight - binding model whose @xmath45 is given by @xmath59 and otherwise @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath46 is chosen so that the electron number per a site , @xmath61 , is fixed .",
    "for the actual calculations , @xmath46 is determined by the bisection method using @xmath62,\\label{eq : mu - int}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second term becomes zero without the interaction terms . here",

    "( [ eq : mu - int ] ) , we put the chemical potentials in @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 the same to reduce the numerical error arising from the cut - off frequency . to reproduce the electronic structure obtained in the lda@xcite , i set @xmath73 ( ev ) and @xmath74 . actually , we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] that the total bandwidth , the topology of each fs sheet , and the location of the van hove singularity of the @xmath33 orbital agree with the lda results@xcite : the total bandwidth is about @xmath75 ev ; the fs consists of the quasi-@xmath34d hole - like @xmath11 and electron - like @xmath76 sheets of the @xmath57 orbital and the quasi-@xmath24d electron - like @xmath77 sheet of the @xmath33 orbital , and the @xmath77 sheet is located nearer the inner sheet in @xmath78 or @xmath79 line than in the experiment@xcite ; the van hove singularity is located above the fermi level",
    ". also , the occupation numbers of the @xmath57 and the @xmath33 orbital , being @xmath80 and @xmath81 , are consistent with the lda values@xcite .",
    "then , i set @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , use @xmath47 as a parameter , and treat the effects of interactions in the flex approximation with the cvcs arising from the self - energy and mt term ; its detail is explained in sect .",
    "2.3 .    finally",
    ", we remark on suitability neglecting the spin - orbit coupling of ru ions for discussing many - body effects on the resistivity .",
    "a density - functional calculation@xcite for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 within local - spin - density approximation shows that the coupling constant is @xmath85 ev , and that the main effect on the electronic structure is the weak mixing between the bands of the @xmath57 and the @xmath33 orbital around @xmath86 and its symmetrically equivalent ones .",
    "this effect will not qualitatively change the results shown in sect .",
    "3 since this coupling constant is smaller than the main terms in @xmath87 and that weak mixing will lead to small changes of the momentum dependence and value of the spin susceptibility from those without the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "thus , i believe that neglecting the spin - orbit coupling is suitable for qualitative discussions about many - body effects on the resistivity .",
    "i briefly review the formal derivation@xcite of the resistivity of a multiorbital hubbard model in a pm metallic phase .",
    "we first derive an exact expression of the longitudinal conductivity , the inverse of the resistivity , in the presence of electron correlation within the linear - response theory@xcite .",
    "then , we rewrite this exact expression in terms of the four - point vertex function by using the three - point vector vertex function .",
    "due to difficulty solving the exact expression , we derive an approximate expression by using the most - divergent - term approximation introduced by liashberg@xcite .    to discuss the resistivity within the linear - response theory",
    ", we use the kubo formula@xcite for the longitudinal conductivity , @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) , in @xmath90-limit and @xmath91 with @xmath92 being the transport relaxation time@xcite , which is of the order of magnitude of the qp lifetime .",
    "namely , @xmath93 is given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is obtained by the analytic continuation of @xmath96 , @xmath97 with bosonic matsubara frequency , @xmath98 . here",
    "@xmath99 is @xmath100 , @xmath101 is the group velocity , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 is @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the reducible four - point vertex function .",
    "thus , the analytic continuation of @xmath103 is necessary to calculate @xmath93 .    before the analytic continuation of @xmath103 , i remark on the important physical meanings of @xmath106 and @xmath91",
    "the order of @xmath107 and @xmath108 is very important in discussing transport properties since the observable currents can be obtained by the dynamical and uniform field ( i.e. , @xmath106 ) but the static and non - uniform field ( i.e. , @xmath109 ) does not cause any observable currents due to the screening induced by the modulations of the charge distribution@xcite . also , the value of @xmath110 is very important since the adiabatic condition @xmath91 means the realization of local equilibrium due to the rapid relaxation compared with @xmath111 , a typical time scale of the field ; as a result of that relaxation , the electronic transports are governed mainly by the qps near the fermi level .",
    "for example , such importance of the inequality of @xmath112 is seen from the difference between the zero and the first sound@xcite .",
    "replacing @xmath113 and @xmath114 in eq .",

    "finally , i discuss applicability of the flex approximation with the cvcs arising from the self - energy and mt term .    first , the flex approximation is suitable to describe the electronic structure at low temperatures for moderately strong electron correlation . in a single - orbital hubbard model on a square lattice@xcite , the imaginary - time dependence of the single - particle green s function at several momenta in the flex approximation shows satisfactory ( but not perfect ) agreement with that in the quantum - monte - carlo calculation at @xmath47 being a half of the bandwidth ; the agreement becomes better near the af qcp than away from the af qcp .",
    "since the similar agreement will hold even in a multiorbital hubbard model on the same lattice and the flex approximation can treat the coherent part of the electronic spectrum satisfactorily@xcite , the electronic structure in metallic phases of the present model at low temperatures will be well described by the flex approximation at least qualitatively . actually , the flex approximation succeeded in reproducing the larger effective mass@xcite of the @xmath33 orbital than that of the @xmath57 orbital@xcite and its agreement with the experiment@xcite is better than the case of the dmft@xcite , as described in sect . 1 .",
    "in contrast , the flex approximation becomes unsuitable at high temperatures or near a mott transition for strong electron correlation .",
    "this is because local correlation plays important roles in such case@xcite and the effects of local correlation on the electronic spectrum are smeared out in the flex approximation@xcite .",
    "then , the magnetic properties at low temperatures for moderately strong electron correlation will be appropriately described by the flex approximation if the dominant correlation of the system is spin fluctuation whose largest contribution comes from a non - degenerate orbital .",
    "due to neglecting the vertex corrections to the susceptibilities , the enhancement of spin fluctuation arising from electron correlation is overestimated in the flex approximation compared with the enhancement of charge or orbital fluctuation . actually , in a two - degenerate - orbital hubbard model on a square lattice at small @xmath200 near an af qcp , the al vertex correction to the susceptibilities causes the enhancement of orbital fluctuation@xcite .",
    "however , i believe that in the present model the flex approximation is sufficient to describe the magnetic properties at least qualitatively since the @xmath33 orbital gives the largest contribution to spin fluctuation@xcite ; in this case , even if the mt and the al vertex correction to the susceptibilities are considered beyond the flex approximation , the magnetic properties will not qualitatively change and these corrections will modify the values of the susceptibilities since orbital fluctuation enhanced due to the al term does not dominate over spin fluctuation . actually , the strongest enhancement of spin fluctuation at @xmath201 in the flex approximation@xcite away from and near the af qcp agrees with the experiments in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1@xcite and sr@xmath0ru@xmath2ti@xmath3o@xmath1@xcite , respectively .    moreover , if the vertex corrections to the current arising from the self - energy and irreducible four - point vertex function due to electron correlation are added to the flex approximation , this method is suitable to describe the transport properties of a metallic phase due to low - frequency external field satisfying @xmath202 at low temperatures .",
    "in contrast to case of the vertex corrections to the susceptibilities , the vertex corrections to the current are essential for discussing the transport properties@xcite since the cvcs are vital to satisfy conservation laws and conservation laws play significant roles in transport phenomena .",
    "for example , the importance of the treatment holding conservation laws is known for a system without the lattice ( e.g. , the electron gas ) : only if the cvcs due to electron correlation are correctly taken into account , we can obtain the correct results such as the absence both of the resistivity@xcite and of the renormalization of the drude weight@xcite and electron cyclotron frequency@xcite .",
    "also , the cvcs due to electron correlation are important in a system with the lattice since these cvcs are necessary to obtain the correct effects of electron correlation on the transport coefficients in the presence of the umklapp scattering@xcite .",
    "another example showing the importance of the cvcs is the emergence of the curie - weiss - like temperature dependence of the hall coefficient near the af qcp due to the mt cvc in the flex approximation in the single - orbital hubbard model on a square lattice@xcite .",
    "in addition to the treatment holding conservation laws , the satisfactory treatment of the coherent part in the flex approximation is powerful to describe the transport properties of a metallic phase due to the low - frequency external field .",
    "this is because the dominant contributions to the response induced by that external field at low temperatures come from the contributions near the fermi level as a result of the energy derivative of the fermi distribution function in the response function .",
    "furthermore , this powerfulness of the flex approximation will hold even near a mott transition since it is shown in the dmft@xcite for a single - orbital hubbard model that the transport properties in @xmath91 are well described in the approximation where only the coherent part is considered .",
    "thus , the flex approximation with the cvcs arising from the self - energy and mt term is satisfactory to describe the transport properties of metallic phases of the present model at low temperatures .",
    "actually , this method@xcite near and away from the af qcp reproduced the temperature dependence of several transport properties of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1@xcite and sr@xmath0ru@xmath2ti@xmath3o@xmath1@xcite , as pointed out in sect . 1 .",

    "we see from figs .",
    "[ fig : fig5](a)[fig : fig5](c ) that the dominant contributions to the total of @xmath221 come from the component of the @xmath31 orbital , and that the component of the @xmath33 orbital is less than @xmath226 of the total .",

    "the hot spot causes the @xmath4-linear dependence of the average of the unrenormalized qp dampings for states along the fs@xcite , the origin of the @xmath4-linear @xmath16 near the af qcp is the hot - spot structure of the qp dampings of the @xmath57 orbital at momenta connected each other by the characteristic spin fluctuations of this af qcp .",
    "in summary , i reviewed many - body effects@xcite of @xmath16 of the quasi-@xmath24d pm ruthenates away from and near the af qcp in the flex approximation with the cvcs arising from the self - energy and mt term or with the cvc arising from the self - energy or without all the cvcs .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath16 away from and near the af qcp qualitatively agree with experiments of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1@xcite and sr@xmath0ru@xmath2ti@xmath3o@xmath1@xcite , respectively : in case away from the af qcp , the crossover between the @xmath4-linear and the @xmath15 dependence at about @xmath218 ev and the @xmath15 dependence at low temperatures are obtained ; in case near the af qcp , the @xmath4-linear dependence even at low temperatures is obtained . here",
    "the main effect of the ti substitution on the temperature dependence of @xmath16 is assumed to be pushing the system nearer the af qcp than sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "the obtained results reveal some important aspects of many - body effects on the resistivity of correlated electron systems .",
    "first , the overestimation of the value of @xmath16 in the relaxation - time approximation and the back - flow - like effect of the mt cvc on the value of @xmath16 are ubiquitous .",
    "it is also ubiquitous that the power of the temperature dependence of the resistivity is determined almost by the temperature dependence of the momentum- and orbital - dependent unrenormalized qp damping .",
    "the similar results have been obtained in a single - orbital hubbard model on a square lattice@xcite .",
    "moreover , the @xmath4-linear resistivity near the af qcp is similar to that obtained in those previous studies@xcite .",
    "however , i emphasize that the criticality of the resistivity , the power of its temperature dependence , does not always connect with the criticality of spin fluctuation enhanced near a magnetic qcp in multiorbital systems , while these are always the same in single - orbital systems .",
    "this characteristic property comes from the facts that the orbital whose unrenormalized qp damping is small mainly contributes to the resistivity , and that the main orbital of the characteristic spin fluctuation of a magnetic qcp has the large unrenormalized qp damping . since the momentum , the temperature , and the orbital dependence of the damping of a qp ( i.e. , the unrenormalized qp damping or the qp damping ) are overlooked in landau s fl theory and such momentum dependence is overlooked in the dmft@xcite , the obtained results highlight their importance in discussing the resistivity of correlated electron systems .",
    "i close this paper with several remarks about the remaining issues .",
    "first , it is necessary to study the transport properties of other ruthenates@xcite using the method i used and discuss the similarities and differences .",
    "in particular , the study for a quasi-@xmath24d ruthenate@xcite near a ferromagnetic qcp is highly desirable to understand the similarities and differences between many - body effects and role of each @xmath23 orbital near the af and the ferromagnetic qcp .",
    "furthermore , it is important to analyze the transport properties of @xmath35d ruthenates@xcite since comparison of the results in quasi-@xmath24d and @xmath35d ruthenates leads to a deep understanding of the dimensionality .",
    "other remaining issues are the applications to other correlated electron systems such as transition - metal oxides@xcite , organic conductors@xcite , cecoin@xmath230@xcite , and upt@xmath38@xcite since these studies are important to deduce ubiquitous properties of correlated electron systems and characteristic properties of multiorbital systems .",
    "then , it is intriguing to study the transport properties in a superconducting phase by extending the present method@xcite in a pm phase since in some cases@xcite the cvcs arising from not only spin fluctuations but also superconducting fluctuations play important roles . furthermore , another remaining issue is to clarify the role of each @xmath23 orbital in the thermal transport@xcite in the superconducting phase of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 on the basis of the method where the orbital dependence of the damping of a qp is satisfactorily considered .",
    "this is because the combination of my result@xcite and several previous studies@xcite suggest the existence of the difference between the main orbitals of the inplane transport and the superconductivity ; if this is correct , we should pay attention to the effects of the orbital - dependent damping of a qp on the thermal transport@xcite for correct understanding of the experimental results .",

    "<S> these indicate the importance of many - body effects beyond landau s fl theory . those effects in multiorbital systems have been little understood , although their understanding is important to deduce ubiquitous properties of correlated electron systems and characteristic properties of multiorbital systems . </S>",
    "<S> to improve this situation , i formulate the resistivity of a multiorbital hubbard model using the extended liashberg theory and adopt this method to the inplane resistivity of quasi - two - dimensional paramagnetic ruthenates in combination with the fluctuation - exchange approximation including the current vertex corrections arising from the self - energy and maki - thompson term . </S>",
    "<S> the results away from and near the antiferromagnetic quantum - critical point reproduce the temperature dependence observed in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 and sr@xmath0ru@xmath2ti@xmath3o@xmath1 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> i highlight the importance of not only the momentum and the temperature dependence of the damping of a quasiparticle but also its orbital dependence in discussing the resistivity of correlated electron systems . </S>"
