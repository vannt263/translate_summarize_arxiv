    "cosmological numerical simulations suggest that a large fraction of the baryonic matter should reside in intergalactic space in the form of a hot / warm intergalactic medium ( igm ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this hot / warm igm contains at least @xmath9 of the baryons predicted by the standard theory of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) at temperatures between @xmath10 to @xmath11 k. observationally little is known about this igm .",
    "recent observations of absorption lines ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) indicate that these -absorbers could be a significant `` baryon reservoir '' at low redshift .    detecting the x - ray absorption features in the x - ray spectrum of a distant quasar",
    "was first proposed by @xcite .",
    "they suggested that an intervening uniform , hot igm would introduce an `` absorption trough '' in the x - ray continuum spectrum of a distant quasar via the `` x - ray gunn - peterson test '' .",
    "absence of such an `` absorption trough '' would put constraints on the temperature , density and ionization states of the diffuse igm .",
    "@xcite extended this idea by including photoionization from the x - ray background radiation . by using numerical simulations @xcite explored the idea that a clumpy , highly - ionized igm concentrated in the gravitational potential caused by dark matter might introduce resonant absorption lines in the x - ray spectrum of a background quasar and denoted them as the `` x - ray forest '' , in analogy to the ly@xmath12 forest in the optical / uv bands .",
    "similar ideas were discussed by @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter fc ) .",
    "a rough estimation shows that even for the largest mass concentrated objects , such as clusters of galaxies , the maximum column densities of the absorption ions ( such as and ) are between @xmath13 - @xmath14 and the maximum equivalent width ( ew ) is far below @xmath15 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "all previous observations have been limited by the spectral resolving power .",
    "for instance , _ rosat _ and _ asca _ could not detect any spectral feature with an ew smaller than @xmath15 .",
    "however , the launch of the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory and _ xmm - newton _ make it possible to study the x - ray spectrum of a distant quasar with high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs , see @xcite ) on board _ chandra _ provides excellent spectral resolution with @xmath16 around @xmath17 .",
    "given such a energy resolution , it is possible to study the resonant absorption lines or edges produced by the hot igm in the x - ray spectrum of a distant quasar @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present observations of two high - redshift quasars : s5 0836 + 710 ( @xmath18 ) and pks 2149 - 306 ( @xmath19 ) . at redshift",
    "higher than @xmath20 , these two sources are the brightest ( s5 0836 + 710 ) and the second ( pks 2149 - 306 ) brightest known quasars in x - ray band . given such a high redshift , the light from the source traverses approximately @xmath21 of the universe , which greatly increases the possibility of being attenuated by the intervening systems .",
    "our primary goal is to find if the predicted `` x - ray forest '' is detectable with the _ chandra _ hetgs and if not , what are the limits of possible absorbers .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we describe the observations in  [ sec : co ] and the data reduction and analysis in  [ sec : da ] . in  [ sec : xcim ] we discuss the constraints on the igm , the last section is a summary . throughout the paper",
    "unless specifically mentioned , we use a hubble constant of @xmath22 .",
    "s5 0836 + 710 and pks 2149 - 306 were observed with the high energy transmission grating spectrometer on board _",
    "chandra_. detailed target information is listed in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "the observation of pks 2149 - 306 was broken into two parts , with approximately 18 hours between them .",
    "the hetgs produces a zero order image at the aim point of the focal plane detector , the acis - s array , with higher order spectra dispersed to either side ( for acis - s , see @xcite ) .",
    "the moderate energy resolution of the acis - s is used to separate the overlapping orders of the dispersed spectrum .",
    "the hetgs consists of two different grating assemblies , the high energy grating ( heg ) and the medium energy grating ( meg ) , and provides nearly constant spectral resolution ( @xmath23 for heg and @xmath24 for meg ) through the entire bandpass ( heg : @xmath25-@xmath26 , meg : @xmath27-@xmath28 ) .",
    "the acis - s array consists of 6 chips ( s0-s5 ) ; however , due to a temporary malfunction of a portion of the on - board readout electronics ( the fep problem , see _ chandra _ proposers observatory guide , or pog ) , only five chips could be used ( s1-s5 ) . due to the radiation - induced charge transfer inefficiency ( cti )",
    "the energy resolution of the four front - illuminated chips has become a function of the chips row number , with a better resolution near the read - out nodes .",
    "therefore , we moved the nominal aim point closer to the read - out nodes by about @xmath29 for s5 0836 + 710 and @xmath30 for pks 2149 - 306 to get better acis energy resolution .",
    "the resulting acis resolution is adequate to allow unambiguous separation of the spectral orders .",
    "data were analyzed with the standard pipeline for the _ chandra _ hetgs provided by the chandra x - ray center ( cxc ) .",
    "we use a combination of _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) v1.1 and custom routines in idl .",
    "the standard screening criteria were applied to the data .",
    "we selected photon events with _",
    "grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 and excluded those with energies above @xmath26 .",
    "we also removed hot columns and bad pixels in each ccd chip .",
    "figure 1 displays the zeroth - order images of both targets in a @xmath31 region .",
    "we have smoothed the images in figure 1 with a gaussian ( @xmath32 ) for visual clarity .",
    "both unsmoothed zeroth - order images are consistent with point sources and can be well fitted by a single gaussian with @xmath33 for s5 0836 + 710 and @xmath34 for pks 2149 - 306 .",
    "the light curves derived from the zeroth orders of both sources were constant to within statistics .",
    "s5 0836 + 710 was reported as having a one - side , superluminal radio jet @xcite at a position angle ( pa ) of @xmath35 .",
    "the jet has a length of at least @xmath36 , which is at the spatial resolving limit of the acis - s .",
    "the head of the jet is located between @xmath37 from center with an opening angle of @xmath38 .",
    "we examine this region in the zeroth order image and find that the @xmath39 upper limit of the flux from this region is @xmath40 of the total flux from the source .",
    "compared with @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the jets of 3c273 @xcite and pks",
    "0637 - 752 @xcite , respectively , we conclude that no x - ray jet was found during this observation .",
    "the observation of pks 2149 - 306 was separated into two parts and the zeroth order images show that the aim points of the two observations were shifted by approximately 2 pixels .",
    "we analyzed the two observations separately and summed them at level 2 of the cxc pipeline to get a combined spectrum .",
    "to fit both meg and heg spectra , we ignored the @xmath43 portion of the meg spectrum due to unmodelled systematic calibration errors of @xmath44 and fit the remaining part simultaneously with the heg spectrum .",
    "we present the fitted heg spectra in figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "the spectral model is a single absorbed power - law where the absorption cross section and metal abundances are from @xcite .",
    "table  [ t2 ] gives the best - fit parameters .",
    "all errors are quoted at @xmath45 confidence . for pks 2149 - 306 , since fits with @xmath46 as a free parameter do not converge , we fix @xmath46 at the galactic value .",
    "s5 0836 + 710 was previously observed by both _",
    "rosat _ and _ asca _ @xcite .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "spectra gave a photon index ( @xmath0 ) of @xmath47 or @xmath48 between @xmath20 and @xmath26 , with free @xmath46 or @xmath46 fixed at the galactic value , respectively .",
    "two _ rosat _ observations showed a steeper spectrum ( the photon indices are @xmath49 and @xmath50 between @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively ) .",
    "the photon index in this observation ( @xmath53 ) is consistent with that of _ asca _ but is flatter than the _ rosat _ result .",
    "we find excess continuum absorption ( above the galactic value , at @xmath54 ) .",
    "the galactic hydrogen column density is @xmath55 with an @xmath56 error of @xmath57@xcite .",
    "excess absorption was also found in _",
    "observation at @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "we see a decreasing of excess absorption of @xmath59 in a timescale of @xmath60 in quasar frame .",
    "it is still unclear the causes of the excess absorption ( instrinsic to the quasar or due to the intervening systems ) and its variation ( see discussions in , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the flux of s5 0836 + 710 decreased by a factor of approximately 2 between the two _ rosat _ observations , and the _ asca _ flux ( @xmath61 between 2 and 10 @xmath62 ) is consistent with the lower _ rosat _ flux .",
    "these observations show a flux approximately twice that seen with _",
    "which is consistent with the higher _ rosat _ flux .",
    "given the overlap of the _ chandra _ hetg and _ asca _ bandpass and the small instrumental calibration uncertainties of _ chandra _ , we conclude that the different flux levels are intrinsic to the quasar .",
    "pks 2149 - 306 was also observed by _ rosat _ and _ asca _ @xcite .",
    "the flux measured using _ asca _ between 2 and 10",
    "@xmath62 is @xmath63 and is about @xmath64 higher than our result .",
    "the photon indices measured using _ asca _",
    "( @xmath65 for detector sis and @xmath66 for detector gis ) are significantly higher than our value ( @xmath67 ) , which indicates spectral variability in this source .",
    "this source was also observed during the _ rosat _ all - sky survey , but the small number of counts precluded spectral fitting ; a rough comparison with _ asca _ also implies spectral variability @xcite .",
    "optically selected quasars can be divided into two categories according to their radio loudness : radio - loud quasar ( rlq ) or radio - quiet quasar ( rqq ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". both of the sources we observed are rlqs .",
    "previous observations by _ einstein _ ,",
    "_ rosat _ and _ asca _ showed that the two types of quasars have significantly different x - ray properties where typically rlqs have flatter power - law indices ( @xmath68 ) than rqqs ( @xmath69)(see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our observation are consistent with this finding , although the spectra we observed are significantly harder than the average .",
    "we are interested in any possible line features in the quasar spectra . to identify line features , we need a good measurement of the continuum .",
    "we use the above absorbed power law models for heg spectra . for meg spectra",
    ", we use the same models and fit the residuals with a 5-order polynomial to account for the remaining uncertainty in the calibration .",
    "this fitted continuum serves as a reference point for measuring line features .",
    "since the meg spectrum spans from @xmath70 to @xmath71 , the 5-order polynomial will affect spectral features larger than @xmath72 but will preserve narrow line features .",
    "the meg spectra for both sources are shown in figure  [ f3 ] .",
    "the bottom panel of each plot gives @xmath73 , and the two dotted lines within the @xmath73 plot correspond to @xmath1 level where @xmath74 is the square root of the observed counts in each bin .",
    "if the model fits the observation well , the counts in each bin should follow the poisson statistic , with a mean count from the fitted spectrum . to verify this",
    ", we calculate the poisson probability @xmath75 for each bin , where @xmath76 is the expect mean number and @xmath77 is the observed value .",
    "@xmath75 should uniformly distribute between @xmath78 and @xmath79 , given that the model fits the observed spectrum . in figure  [ f4 ] we show the cumulative distributions of @xmath75 for both quasars .",
    "we also show the cumulative distribution of the uniform distribution as the dotted line .",
    "we run a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test to test the null hypothesis that the both @xmath75 are uniformly distributed .",
    "the ks test shows that the null hypothesis is accepted at a significance level of @xmath80 for s5 0836 + 710 and @xmath81 for pks 2149 - 306 .",
    "a line feature should at least have a signal - to - noise ratio at or above @xmath1 level to be identified .",
    "figure  [ f3 ] shows that most of the bins are well distributed within the @xmath1 level .",
    "the two exceptions occur at around @xmath82 for s5 0836 + 710 , where @xmath83 , and at around @xmath84 for pks 2149 - 306 , where @xmath85 . assuming a poisson distribution for each bin",
    ", we ran @xmath86 monte - carlo simulations for both spectra and find that the probability for observing one bin with @xmath87 in one observation of s5 0836 + 710 is @xmath88 , and observing one bin with @xmath89 in one observation of pks 2149 - 306 is @xmath90 .",
    "so we conclude that no line feature is identified .",
    "iron emission lines have been detected in several high - redshift quasars with _ asca _ ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , no previous observation discovered any emission lines in these two sources , with the exception of @xcite ( y99 hereafter ) for pks 2149 - 306 , which we will discuss later . in _",
    "observations the upper limit on the equivalent width of an fe k@xmath12 emission line ( @xmath91 ) is @xmath92 for s5 0836 + 710 or @xmath93 for pks 2149 - 306 , respectively ( @xcite ; line measured in the observer s frame , with line width @xmath94 for an unresolved line ) .",
    "the fe k emission lines are located between @xmath95 and @xmath96 , ranging from neutral iron to helium or hydrogen - like iron . for both sources these lines are expected at energies around @xmath52 in the observer s frame , where the _ chandra _ hetgs has a large collecting area and high resolving power .",
    "no significant line feature was detected in the spectrum of either source at a @xmath39 level . in table",
    "[ t3 ] we list the upper limit equivalent width ( ew ) at two energies , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , for both meg and heg spectra for two assumed intrinsic line widths , @xmath94 and @xmath97 , respectively . the instrumental line response function is taken into account .",
    "since the _ chandra _ hetgs has better resolving power than _ asca _ , we can put a much tighter constraint on the equivalent width of the iron emission lines .",
    "we should emphasize that the low value of @xmath94 is adopted to calculate the theoretically low limit of detectable ew and since we have no constraint on the upper limit of the intrinsic line width , the ew limit could be worse by a factor of 2 if @xmath98 .",
    "y99 reported that they found a significant emission feature around @xmath99 in the _ asca _ spectrum of pks 2149 - 306 .",
    "they proposed that this line was blue - shifted fe - k emission with a bulk - motion velocity around @xmath100 ( head - on ) and a rest - frame ew of @xmath101 ( assuming an intrinsic line width of @xmath102 , errors are @xmath45 confidence ) .",
    "we do not detect any emission feature around @xmath99 at @xmath39 level in either heg or meg spectra , and set an upper limit of the ew as low as @xmath103 ( table  [ t3 ] ) . if we adopt the value of @xmath104 as used by y99 , the rest - frame ew limit is @xmath105 and still much smaller than @xmath106 , which is their @xmath45 confidence lower bound .",
    "a recent observation by _",
    "@xcite also addressed the existence of such a feature .",
    "x - ray resonant absorption lines are produced by highly ionized heavy elements .",
    "the detection of any absorption line depends on three factors : ( 1 ) the spectral intensity of the background quasar ; ( 2 ) the physical properties of the intervening absorbers , specifically , the ion column density and velocity dispersion ( both turbulent and thermal broadening ) ; ( 3 ) the instrumental properties , such as the resolving power and effective area .",
    "given that ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) are already known , we can constrain the properties of the absorbers . for demonstration",
    "we select the the spectrum of s5 0836 + 710 and calculate the expected signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) for and ( see figure  [ f5 ] ) , given the column density of and at different redshifts and velocity dispersions ( @xmath107 , in units of @xmath108 ) .",
    "two values of @xmath107-parameter , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , are adopted to bracket the typical velocity dispersions of hot gas associated with groups and clusters of galaxies . since the strongest resonance lines of and ,",

    "the detection of the x - ray resonant absorption lines is closely related to the overall baryon density ( @xmath6 ) and matter density ( @xmath5 ) in the universe . for a given level of metal enrichment , higher baryon density in general",
    "implies larger amounts of highly ionized metals and a higher possibility of detecting the x - ray absorption lines created by these metals in the spectrum of a distant quasar . on the other hand , as we predicted in @xcite , most of the high column density ions ( specifically , at column density higher than @xmath118 )",
    "are located in the collapsed , virialized objects , such as groups or clusters of galaxies , in the form of hot intracluster or intragroup gas ) from these filaments are generally too weak to be detectable with _",
    "chandra _ and even _ constellation - x_. ] . since @xmath5 governs the overall amplitude of the density fluctuations , changing @xmath5 will dramatically change the spatial density of virialized objects , and so the distribution of ions at high column density .    to investigate how @xmath6 and @xmath5 can affect the x - ray spectra of high redshift quasars , we calculate the x - ray forest distribution function ( xfdf , for details , see @xcite ; fc ) .",
    "the xfdf , @xmath119 , is defined as the number of absorption systems along the line of sight with a column density between @xmath120 and @xmath121 per unit redshift , where @xmath122 is the column density for ion @xmath123 . for a source at redshift @xmath124 ,",
    "the total absorption line number for ion @xmath123 , with a column density above a certain number @xmath125 is given by @xmath126 since the xfdf is determined by cosmological parameters , such as @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( see figures 2,3,4 of fc ) , by comparing the expected absorption line number ( @xmath127 ) with observations , we may set the constraints on these cosmological parameters .",
    "based on the _ chandra _ observations we set the upper limit of different ion column densities ( see section  [ sec : al ] ) , which gives @xmath125 in equation  ( [ eq : exp ] ) .",
    "the minimum detectable column density for is @xmath128 and for is @xmath129 .",

    "@xmath133 is the metal abundance relative to the solar value where @xmath133 = 1 indicates solar abundance , and we integrate equation ( [ eq : exp ] ) to @xmath134 for and to @xmath135 for .",
    "the poisson statistic shows that the probability of detecting less than one absorption line is @xmath136 given such an expectation .",
    "so with the current observations we are not able to constrain those cosmological parameters .",
    "this is also evidenced in fc .",
    "for example , in figure 7 of fc , even for the scdm model , the expected number of absorption lines with @xmath137 and @xmath138 is equal to or below one .",
    "this method illustrates the possibility of constraining the cosmological parameters by observing more x - ray bright quasars with longer exposure time .",
    "for example , if a quasar is brighter than s5 0836 + 710 by a factor of two , by increasing the exposure time to @xmath139 ksec , the minimum detectable column density for can be as low as @xmath140 .",

    "the poisson statistic shows that the probability of observing at least one line is @xmath8 if the expectation is three .",
    "this means by observing @xmath7 sources which are twice brighter than s5 0836 + 710 , we should have @xmath8 chance of detecting at least one absorption line with an exposure time of @xmath139 ksec .",
    "previous observations show that at low and moderate redshifts , there are several tens of quasars having a flux higher than @xmath147 between @xmath148 kev , or @xmath149 between @xmath150 kev ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . by increasing the number observations of bright quasars at low and moderate redshifts",

    "given such a low column density , we will detect as many as eight or ten absorption lines for a moderately luminous quasar at redshift of @xmath152 , respectively .",

    "for example , for the cmb predicted baryon density , the temperatures of the igm are constrained in a range with @xmath184 k : temperatures above this range are ruled out by the cmb spectrum , and at a temperature below this range the igm will produce strong distortion in the quasar spectrum . in figure",
    "[ f6]b we illustrate such a distortion in the meg spectrum of s5 0836 + 710 , based on a lcdm model .",
    "the dotted line represents the absorbed spectrum by an igm with @xmath179 at @xmath185 k and @xmath186 .",
    "given such an igm , the model severely deviates from the observed spectrum .    based on the _ rosat _ pspc observations of three high - redshift quasars , @xcite concluded that the x - ray opacity of a hot diffuse igm is too small to constrain the igm .",
    "for instance , they found that their x - ray gunn - peterson test did not constrain the igm temperature above @xmath187 k with @xmath188 and solar abundances ( figure 11 in their paper ) .",
    "our analysis indicates that the constraint can be improved significantly even with half - solar abundances , due to the high energy resolving power of _ chandra _ hetgs .",
    "our results are similar to their predictions with _",
    "chandra _ low - energy transmission grating spectrometer ( letg ) , based on a simulated observation of 3c 273 .",
    "however , due to the limitation of the small effective area , we are not able to constrain the igm with low metallicity based on current data . in future ,",
    "_ constellation - x _ will increase the effective area by two magnitudes over _ chandra _ hetgs and may eventually reveal the properties of the igm .",
    "in this paper we report the _ chandra _ observations of two high - redshift , radio - loud quasars , s5 0836 + 710 and pks 2149 - 306 .    1 .",
    "the photon index ( @xmath0 ) for s5 0836 + 710 is 1.39 , consistent with previous observations with _",
    "rosat _ and _ asca_. compared with previous observations , pks 2149 - 306 has a rather soft spectrum with @xmath189 .",
    "both photon indexes are consistent with the fact that rlqs have flatter spectra compared with rqqs .",
    "we also find excess continuum absorption ( above the galactic value ) in s5 0836 + 710 .",
    "the flux of s5 0836 + 710 is higher than in previous _ asca _",
    "observations and puts this source as one of the most luminous objects at high redshift .",
    "2 .   no significant absorption or emission feature is found in both sources at or above @xmath1 level .",
    "we put constraints on the possible emitters or absorbers .",
    "for example , fe k emission lines were found in several rlqs @xcite , although not as frequently as in rqqs .",
    "we put tight upper limits on ew , as low as @xmath2 in both sources .",
    "we do not find the emission feature reported by y99 in the spectrum of pks 2149 - 306 around @xmath99 .",
    "we also examine the possible intervening systems and give upper limits on the absorbers ion column density .",
    "we discuss the possibility of constraining the properties of the igm .",
    "we develop a method to constrain cosmological parameters based on the x - ray forest method . however , we are not able to set any meaningful constraints based on current data .",
    "the x - ray gunn - peterson test was also performed and we find that , by combining with the constraints from the cmb compton @xmath181-parameter , this method can be applied to constrain a uniform , enriched igm .",
