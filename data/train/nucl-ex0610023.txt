    "the study of peripheral interactions of light odd - even nuclei @xmath7li and @xmath0b in nuclear track emulsion can provide a ground for including tritons as clusters into the general pattern of multiple fragmentation of heavier nuclei @xcite .",
    "it is established that in the white  stars produced by relativistic @xmath7li nuclei in most peripheral collisions , the @xmath7li@xmath8 channel constitutes as high as 50% @xcite . in this way a dominant role a triton as a cluster with lowest separation energy ( 2.47 mev ) has been revealed for the case of relativistic @xmath7li nuclei . the present @xmath0b experiment is a logical continuation of the @xmath7li study aiming to establish the probabilities of the low threshold channels , namely , @xmath9 ( 8.67 mev ) , @xmath10 ( 11.22 mev ) , and @xmath11 ( 11.23 mev ) . in particular , it will allow one to verify whether exists a correlation between a channel threshold value , fragment number and composition , and the corresponding propability .",
    "the @xmath0b nucleus is a daughter one in the @xmath12 decay of its mirror nucleus @xmath0c having a very similar level structure . as application",
    ", the present study will provide a comparison ground to explore in future the @xmath13he role as a cluster in low threshold breakups of a @xmath0c nucleus : @xmath14 ( 7.54 mev ) , @xmath15 ( 9.22 mev ) , and @xmath11 ( 8.69 mev ) and to evalute a coulomb effects in a few - body fragmentation .",
    "a stack of br-2 photoemulsion layers , the dimensions and the thickness of which being 10@xmath1620 @xmath17 and 600 @xmath18 m , repectively , was exposured to a beam of @xmath0b nuclei accelerated to a momentum 2.75a gev / c at the jinr nuclotron .",
    "an example of the central interaction of relativistic @xmath0b in emulsion is given in fig .",
    "[ fig:111 ] .",
    "the @xmath0b beam was directed parallel to the long side of the emulsion plane .",
    "interactions were sought by viewing along the primary nucleus track . over the total viewed -track length of 7141.5 cm we found 542 interactions of @xmath0b with emulsion nuclei used in this analysis .",
    "in such a way , the mean free path was found to be @xmath19=(13.2@xmath200.6 ) cm .",
    "this value agrees well with the calculations by the geometric model .",
    "the relativistic fragment charge was determined by the method of counting the number of @xmath21 electrons on the fragment track .",
    "the results of the determination of the charges z@xmath3=3 - 5 by this method are given in fig .",

    "the emission angles for z@xmath222 are restricted in interval @xmath233@xmath24 , and the ones for doubly charged fragments to an interval @xmath255@xmath24 .",
    "the angles for singly charged particles were measured in an interval @xmath2515@xmath24 .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ( above ) shows that the angular distribution changes its shape at about @xmath26=6@xmath24 .",
    "this shape of the angular distribution may be due to the fact that the singly charged particles are a mixture of the particles of the two kinds : relativistic hydrogen isotopes and produced mesons the angular distributions of which are displaced relatively to one another . as momentum measurements show",
    "the distribution for singly charged fragments occupy a region @xmath236 - 8@xmath24 . basing on the momentum measurements ,",
    "the angular distribution shape and the estimation of the projectile fragmentation angle by the equation    @xmath27    a limiting angle for singly charged fragments was chosen to be @xmath26=6@xmath24 .",
    "in order to study @xmath0b cluster degrees of freedom use was made of the events in which the total charge of particles emitted within the fragmenting cone is equal to the charge of the projectile nucleus q=@xmath28z@xmath3 .",
    "such events were divided into two classes a and b. class a implies the breakup of a projectile not accompanied by the production of new particles , n@xmath29=0 . in their turn , the a class events can be subdivided into two groups : interactions without breakup of a target , n@xmath30=0 ( n@xmath30=n@xmath31+n@xmath32 ) or whitestars , and interactions accompanied by the breakup of a target , n@xmath338 , n@xmath32=0 in which the presence of several low - energy fragments is allowed .",
    "these group which posess close characteristics are united into common class in order to increase statistics .",
    "events of the class a are notable for a low energy transfered to the projectile which results mostly in violations of intrinsic intercluster bonds",
    ". therefore they are most interesting for the study of nuclear clustering .",
    "class b implies peripheral but violent interactions of nuclei . in the events of this class , there can exist newly produced particles with emission angles @xmath3415@xmath24 , as well as any quantity of the target fragments , n@xmath350 .",

    "this channel for whitestars produced in fragmentation of @xmath43b nuclei amounts to 65% .",

    "there was observed no li fragments , while in peripheral interactions ( b ) such events constitute 13% .",

    "the probability of observing a 4 + 1 topology in the @xmath43b@xmath44p+@xmath48be decay is found small ( 3% ) .",
    "even being limited with current statistics one may conclude that the 3-body decays with a charge configuration 2 + 2 + 1 fig .",
    "[ fig : aba11])play a leading role in peripheral breakups of @xmath0b as well as @xmath43b nuclei in spite of higher threshold values with the respect to the li+he mode ones",
    ". it may be noticed , that the both breakup patterns is indicative of an analogy with the 3-body dissociation @xmath49c@xmath443@xmath50 with one of @xmath50 particles substituted by a deuteron or triton @xcite .",
    "in order to study the basic @xmath0b fragmentation chahhel , @xmath28z@xmath3=2 + 2 + 1 the singly charged fragment momenta were measured by the coulomb multiple scattering method .",
    "the measurements enabled us to divide the singly charged fragments into protons , deuterons and tritons using the fact that the spectator fragments conserve the momentum per nucleon equal the primary one : @xmath51 .",
    "the results of measurements are given in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . as is seen , this method makes it possible to separate reliably the singly charged fragments by their mass .",
    "thus we had determined for this channel the ratio between protons , deuterons and tritons : n@xmath4:n@xmath5:n@xmath6=4:4:4 for @xmath0b breakup events and n@xmath4:n@xmath5:n@xmath6=17:5:1 for the @xmath0b peripheral interactions ( table [ tab:2 ] ) .",

    "a large part of fragment tritons in @xmath0b breakups ( about 1/3 ) testifies in favor of their existance as clusters weak internal bonds in @xmath0b which are easily get destroyed in violent interaction processes . besides , in 7 peripheral interactions ( 23% ) the momentum of singly charged particles was less than 1 gev / c , that is , they may be either newly produced particles , or scattered protons .",
    "thus , it is confirmed that the breakups of nuclei are more effective for the study of their cluster structure as compared with the violent interactions of nuclei .",
    "the events of the classes a and b in which the charge of the primary track was 5 and total charge in the fragmentation cone was @xmath28z@xmath3=6 were ascribed to the inelastic charge exchange events above a particle decay threshold of an excited @xmath0c@xmath53 nucleus .",

    "of these , 6 events belong to class a , in 5 events there is none of the particles but the above mentioned fragments , and two events belong to the class b. the fraction of such events is about 1.5% of all events found in the initial scanning of the interactions , that is , the mean free path for the charge exchange of @xmath0b to @xmath0c@xmath53 @xmath19 is equal to ( 0.89@xmath200.32 ) m.    c|c|c|c|c|c|c    n@xmath36  &  n@xmath37  &  n@xmath38  &  n@xmath39  &  n@xmath40  &  n@xmath41  &  n@xmath42   +  1  &  -  &  -  &  -  &  1  &  0  &  1 +  -  &  1  &  -  &  1  &  -  &  6  &  2 +  -  &  1  &  -  &  -  &  2  &  0  &  7 +  -  &  -  &  1  &  -  &  3  &  0  &  2 +  -  &  -  &  -  &  2  &  2  &  0  &  3 +    table [ tab:3 ] clearly demonstrate appearance of low - lying cluster modes when collision inelasticity has a minimal obsevability .",
    "the decay of @xmath0c nucleus into two particles with charges 4 and 2 can occur only in the @xmath0c@xmath54be+@xmath55he . in the events of the class",
    "a , there was found no inelastic charge exchange of @xmath0b to @xmath0c with a decay in other channels .",
    "however , in order to establish unabiguously the fact of the charge exchange it is required to carry out he momentum measurements . nevertheless , in distinction to the considered above @xmath0b case in table [ tab:1 ] there is indication in on more important role of 2-body dissociations of excited @xmath0c than 3-body ones - a class events with final state 3he were not observed ( table [ tab:3 ] ) .",
    "this obvious difference may be originated due to a higher coulomb barrier in a @xmath0c nucleus .",
    "this feature has to be verified in special @xmath0c study provided with emulsions exposured in a secondary beam of these nuclei produced in the charge exchange process @xmath0b@xmath56c .",

    ". already found @xmath0b collisions will allow us to improve our statistics by factor 4 - 5 to strengthen the conlclusions . nevertheless , in spite of rather limited statistics analyzed to the present time one can derive the important features of peripheral fragmentation of @xmath0b nuclei .",
