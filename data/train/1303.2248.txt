    "<S> we give a canonical procedure associating to an algebraic number @xmath0 first a hyperelliptic curve @xmath1 , and then a triangle curve @xmath2 obtained through the normal closure of an associated belyi function .    in this way we show that the absolute galois group @xmath3 acts faithfully on the set of isomorphism classes of marked triangle curves , and on the set of connected components of marked moduli spaces of surfaces isogenous to a higher product ( these are the free quotients of a product @xmath4 of curves of respective genera @xmath5 by the action of a finite group @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show then , using again the surfaces isogenous to a product , first that it acts faithfully on the set of connected components of moduli spaces of surfaces of general type ( amending an incorrect proof in a previous arxiv version of the paper ) ; and then , as a consequence , we obtain that for every element @xmath7 , not in the conjugacy class of complex conjugation , there exists a surface of general type @xmath8 such that @xmath8 and the galois conjugate surface @xmath9 have nonisomorphic fundamental groups .    using polynomials with only two critical values </S>",
    "<S> , we can moreover exhibit infinitely many explicit examples of such a situation . </S>"
