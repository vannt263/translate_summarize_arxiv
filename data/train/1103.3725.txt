    "in the quest for finding habitable worlds , the efforts to detect small planets are starting to pay off with the discovery of the first three transiting super - earths : corot-7b , gj1214b and kepler-10b .",
    "they exemplify the fruitful results of three different missions that have the potential to detect low - mass planets : the french - led corot mission ( @xcite ) , the mearth ground mission that surveys the nearest m dwarfs stars ( @xcite ) and the space mission kepler , that can detect planets as small as earth thanks to its unprecedented precision ( @xcite ) . in the next few years",
    ", the count for super - earths is expected to grow , especially from objects being measured by kepler . however , many of them will not have measured masses as kepler s targets are a challenge for the radial velocity telescopes observing the same field of view .",
    "we will have to wait for harps - nef ( @xcite ) to be built before measuring their masses .",
    "armed with masses and radii , and an appropriate internal structure model we can infer the composition of super - earths . owing to the degenerate character of the problem , there is no unique solution , and what we can infer is bounds to the composition .",
    "however , the very short period planets have an additional constraint , as their insolation values are very high making their atmospheres susceptible to escape .",
    "this is the case for the first three transiting planets , especially corot-7b and kepler-10b that have orbital periods of less than one day ! in addition",
    ", there is one hot transiting - only planet , kepler-9d , for which only the radius is known . despite the lack of information on its mass , the planet is also so irradiated , that it is possible to place some constraints on its composition .    in these proceedings",
    "i will describe what we have learned about the composition of each of the transiting low - mass planets , and use kepler-9d as an example to show what can be inferred for transiting - only hot super - earths .",
    "in contrast to the structure of the gaseous planets , which have very small cores compared to their fluid h / he envelopes , super - earths and to some extent mini - neptunes are mostly dominated by their rocky / icy cores , and their atmospheres play only a small role in terms of their bulk composition .",
    "this is why an internal structure model that takes into account the complexity of rock and ice structure , as seen in the terrestrial planets and icy satellites in our solar system , is the appropriate one for super - earths . despite having non - massive gaseous envelopes ( up to several earth - masses ) ,",
    "mini - neptunes call for a model that calculates correctly the temperature structure of the envelope , as it has a substantial effect on the density of water vapour and h / he .",
    "the results presented here were obtained by combining the internal structure model by valencia et al ( @xcite ) for the rocky / icy interiors with the internal structure model cepam ( @xcite ) for the gaseous envelope composed of h@xmath0o and/or h / he .",
    "while the former model has been applied and tested for super - earths and the solid planets in the solar system , the latter has been used successfully to model the giant planets in the solar system and in extra solar systems .",
    "the boundary condition at the solid - gaseous interface satisfies continuity in pressure and mass .",
    "@xcite discuss details of the combined model .",
    "corot-7b and kepler-10b are planets that share similar features : their radii , their period , the type of host star and perhaps their mass .",
    "their major differences are their age , and the uncertainty on their masses .",
    "corot-7 is a very active star , which makes the radial velocity data very noisy .",
    "several studies have suggested different values for the mass , with a combined uncertainty of @xmath1 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "however , three of the four studies suggest that the mass is compatible with a rocky composition .",
    "kepler-10b , on the other hand , has a well determined mass and an exquisitely well determined radius @xmath2 ( @xcite ) , thanks to the tight constraints on the star allowed by asteroseismology .",
    "the object is compact enough that a rocky composition is inferred .",
    "the range of possible rocky compositions vary mostly due to the amount of total iron the planet has , which is distributed mostly in the core and some in the mantle , unless the planet is undifferentiated . to span the range of rocky compositions we consider two unlikely extremes : a pure iron planet , and a planet devoid of any iron ( close to a moon - like composition ) ; and two compositions present in the solar system : earth - like ( 33% iron core , 67% silicate mantle , with an iron to silicate ratio of 2 ) , and a composition enhanced in iron similar to that of mercury ( 63% iron core , 37% silicate mantle ) .",
    "corot-7b s first mass @xmath3 ( @xcite ) and radius @xmath4 estimations ( @xcite ) made it a planet lighter than earth ( see figure 1 ) . with improved stellar parameters",
    ", the radius was revised to a smaller value of @xmath5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this more compact scenario made the planet more earth - like. subsequently , the mass of the planet has been intensely revised . while @xcite and @xcite both obtain larger values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , making the planet denser and compatible with a composition between earth - like and mercury - like",
    ", @xcite suggests a mass of only @xmath8 which can not be reconciled with a rocky composition .",
    "this low value can only be satisfied with significant amounts of volatiles .",
    "on the other hand , the mass and radius of kepler-10b is concordant with a composition between an earth - like and a mercury - like planet .",
    "thus , if we disregard @xcite suggested mass value for corot-7b , both planets appear to be almost identical in composition .",
    "this stresses the importance of establisthing the reliability of @xcite treatment to infer the mass of corot-7b .",
    "while we might be tempted at first to classify these planets as rocky based on their bulk densities and proximity to their host stars , only through a rigorous analysis on the likelihood of other compositions can we be sure that they are indeed telluric planets . to this effect , we considered planets with different amounts of water vapor or a hydrogen and helium mixture above an earth - like nucleus , combined with a simple analysis of atmospheric escape to determine if the timescales of evaporation of these envelopes are consistent with the ages of the planets ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the results .",
    "based on a simple hydrodynamic espace treatment the timescale of evaporation of water vapor is around a gigayear , while for h - he it is only a few million years .",
    "given the compact size of both planets , and the short timescale of evaporation , we can infer that there is no h - he in both kepler-10b and corot-7b , even with the low mass value suggested by @xcite .",
    "it is also clear that kepler-10b is too compact to allow for any significant water vapor , plus the fact that it is a much older planet ( at least 8 billion years old ) suggests the evaporation would have taken place for longer .",
    "therefore , it is safe to assume it is a rocky planet .",
    "o above an earth - like nucleus .",
    ", width=326 ]    for corot-7b , the timescale of evaporation of water vapor is of the same order of magnitude as the age of the system .",
    "thus , it is possible that water vapor has not evaporated completely from the planet . according to @xcite s estimate",
    ", corot-7b has at most a few tens of percents ( less than 40% ) of water vapor ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . for the larger mass values suggested by @xcite , and @xcite ,",
    "there is less than a few percents of water vapor . and for the mass values suggested by @xcite to have some water vapor , the solid nucleus beneath has to be significantly enhanced in iron with respect to an earth - like composition .",
    "+    .data for transiting super - earths and kepler-9d [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in contrast to corot-7b and kepler-10b , there is no ambiguity that gj 1214b has a volatile envelope .",
    "this planet has a radius that is about 1000 km larger than if it was made of pure ice , the lightest composition for a solid planet .",
    "the important question is the nature of this envelope . as a starting point",
    ", we consider planets that have different amounts of water vapor above an earth - like nucleus , up to a composition that is of pure h@xmath0o ( see fig .",
    "the boundary condition we used is based on the calculations by @xcite for the pressure - temperature of the atmosphere of this planet . for different compositions ,",
    "they obtain a value close to 1000 k at 10 bars . for this boundary condition",
    ", we find that gj 1214b can be made of 100% water vapor .",
    "however , this composition is unlikely .",
    "before water can condense out of the solar nebula , refractory material has to condense out .",
    "an upper limit to the ratio of water to refractory material can be estimated from the composition of comets , with a dust to gas ratio of 1 - 2 .",
    "therefore , given the fact that we expect some rocky material to be present in the composition of this planet , we also expect a component ligher than water .",
    "we propose this to be a hydrogen and helium mixture ( see @xcite for other suggestions ) .",
    "we calculate the maximum amount of h - he to be 8% by mass by adding varying amounts of refractory material in the form of an earth - like composition .",
    "an important note to make is that this result hinges on the boundary condition for the atmosphere that we chose . at this point",
    ", we are testing the sensitivity of this result .",
    "o above an earth - like nucleus .",
    "the pure - ice line shows that gj 1214b is a vapor planet .",
    ", width=326 ]    one advantage of characterizing gj1214b , is that the system is amenable to further for observations . in fact , two different groups have obtained transmission spectra to constrain the composition of the atmosphere at the millibar lever . while @xcite suggest that the composition is h - he , @xcite report a non - detection . to reconcile their results",
    ", the latter authors argue that they might be seeing hazes .    at first value , our result of an envelope with h - he making up to 8% by mass of the planet seems consistent with the results @xcite .",
    "if there is h - he at the 10 bar level and deeper , it is reasonable to expect some of it also at the millibar level , more so than water . to properly characterize gj1214b two things have to happen : the observations have to be reconciled in a coherent picture of what the composition is at the millibar lever , and then this has to be reconciled with the theory of the internal structure of the planet .",
    "early in 2011 , the kepler team announced more than 1000 planet candidates , most of them having only measured radii ( @xcite ) . even though there can not be any absolute inferences on the composition of a planet without a mass measurement , it is still possible to put limits on the amount of volatiles of the short - period planets that only have a radius measurement .",
    "an example is kepler-9d with a measured radius of @xmath9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is the smallest object orbiting kepler-9 at 1.59 days , in a system with two saturn - like planets in close resonance at 19.2 and 38.9 day periods ( @xcite ) . even though there is no confirmation from radial velocity observations , ( @xcite )",
    "have done a careful analysis to assess the likelihood of false positives from which they conclude that kepler-9d is most likely a planet .",
    "a maximum mass of 15 - 20 @xmath10 is estimated from a non - detection in the radial velocity measurements ( private communication with m. holman ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the radius range for kepler-9d and different mass - radius relationships .",
    "one advantage of the short - period planets is that if they have envelopes they are very hot and expanded , limiting the amount of volatiles present in the composition for a given radius constraint .",
    "this is exemplified by the flaring of the mass - radius curves for h - he compositions for planets with masses below 5 @xmath10 and to some extent of the h@xmath0o compositions for planets with masses below 2 @xmath10 .",
    "these planets do not have enough gravity to keep tightly bounded their very hot and expansive envelopes .",
    "this means that for kepler-9d we can rule out compositions with more than a few tens in 10000 parts of h - he by mass , and more than 50% water vapor content .    on the other hand , for this planet to be rocky , its mass would have to be more than 3 @xmath10 .",
    "larger masses would call for more iron content , with an earth - like composition corresponding to a mass range between 4 - 10 @xmath10 , a mercury - like composition to the range 7 - 15 @xmath10 , and a pure iron composition to the range 13 - 30 @xmath10 .",
    "the latter would be an unlikely composition , perhaps possible only after complete evaporation of a silicate mantle .",
    "thus , based on physical grounds , the absolute maximum mass for kepler-9d is 30 @xmath10 , although a more realistic upper limit is @xmath1115 @xmath12@xmath10 , when using mercury s composition as a proxy .",
    "o above an earth - like nucleus .",
    "four rocky compositions are shown varying in the amount of iron content : super - moon ( no iron ) , earth - like , mercury - like , to pure - iron planet ( see figure 1 for detailed description of compositions ) .",
    "the radius data for kepler-9d is shown in black . in grey ,",
    "the data for kepler-10b , corot-7b and gj1214b are reproduced for reference .",
    "see also related work in @xcite .",
    ", width=326 ]",
    "now that we have formally entered the era of super - earths with the first transiting such planets having measured masses and radii , we can start placing constraints on their composition . given the degenerate character of the problem , the first challenge is to differentiate the planets that are mainly solid ( rocky or icy ) from the ones that have non - negligible volatile envelopes ( more than a few percent by mass ) .",
    "this task plus the bias towards detecting short - period planets brings to light the importance of better understanding and modelling atmospheric escape , as these planets are highly irradiated by their host stars .",
    "any composition that allows for a volatile envelope has to be reconciled with the planet s history of mass loss .    from this initial small sample of low - mass planets , there are two robust although simple conclusions : kepler-10b is a rocky planet , while gj 1214b has a significant amount of volatiles ( better termed a mini - neptune ) . kepler-10b s composition ranges in iron content from an earth - like ( 67% silicate mantle + 33% iron core ) to a mercury - like ( 63% silicate mantle + 37% iron core ) composition .",
    "although it is clear that gj 1214b has a volatile envelope , it is unclear what the nature of of this envelope is , and especially if it is water vapor dominated or h - he dominated . from internal structure models ,",
    "the maximum amount of h - he possible is 8% by mass .",
    "in addition , the two reported observations on the scale height , and therefore the composition of the atmosphere ( at the millibar level ) seem contradicting .",
    "we stand to learn a lot about the mini - neptunes through a careful characterization of gj 1214b .",
    "on the other hand , the nature of corot-7b is controversial , given the large uncertainty on its mass .",
    "three of the four studies point towards a plausible rocky composition , and one forbids it . determining if this planet has a mass less than 4 @xmath10 is key , to classify it as a super - earth or a mini - neptune , with implications about its origin and evolution . in any case , we can rule h - he in the envelope given the relatively small size of the planet , and the short timescale of evaporation of such an envelope compared to the age of the system .",
    "lastly , even though it is impossible to characterize transit - only planets , we can still estimate the maximum mass of these planets and put constraints on their amount of volatile content ( especially for the hot ones ) .",
    "one example is kepler-9d , for which we find that a reasonable maximum mass based on physical grounds is 15 @xmath10 ( consistent with a non - detection given the precision of the radial velocity analysis ) , a maximum amount of water vapor at the 50% by mass level , and less than 0.1% of h - he .",
