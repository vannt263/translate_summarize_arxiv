    "the frequency band structure of artificial periodic dielectrics formally known as photonic crystals is the electromagnetic ( em ) counterpart of the electronic band structure in ordinary atomic solids .",
    "recently , a new analogy between electron and photon states in periodic structures has been proposed by raghu and haldane , @xcite namely the one - way chiral edge states in two - dimensional ( 2d ) photonic - crystal slabs which are similar to the corresponding edge states in the quantum hall effect .",
    "@xcite the photonic chiral edge states are a result of time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry breaking which comes about with the inclusion of gyroelectric/ gyromagnetic material components ; these states are robust to disorder and structural imperfections as long as the corresponding topological invariant ( chern number in this case ) remains constant .    in certain atomic solids , tr",
    "symmetry breaking is not prerequisite for the appearance of topological electron states as it is the case in the quantum hall effect .",
    "namely , when spin - orbit interactions are included in a tr symmetric graphene sheet , a bulk excitation gap and spin - filtered edge states emerge @xcite without the presence of an external magnetic field , a phenomenon which is known in literature as quantum spin hall effect .",
    "its generalization to three - dimensional ( 3d ) atomic solids lead to a new class of solids , namely , topological insulators .",
    "@xcite the latter possess a spin - orbit - induced energy gap and gapless surface states exhibiting insulating behavior in bulk and metallic behavior at their surfaces .",
    "apart from topological insulators where the spin - orbit band structure with tr symmetry defines the topological class of the corresponding electron states , other topological phases have been proposed such as topological superconductors ( band structure with particle - hole symmetry ) , @xcite magnetic insulators ( band structure with magnetic translation symmetry ) , @xcite and , very recently , topological crystalline insulators .",
    "@xcite in the latter case the band structure respects tr symmetry as well as a certain point - group symmetry leading to bulk energy gap and gapless surface states .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a photonic analog of a topological crystalline insulator .",
    "our model photonic system is a 3d crystal of weakly interacting resonators respecting tr symmetry and the point - symmetry group associated with a given crystal surface . as a result",
    ", the system possesses an omnidirectional band gap within which gapless surface states of the em field are supported .",
    "it is shown that the corresponding photonic band structure is equivalent to the energy band structure of an atomic topological crystalline insulator and , as such , the corresponding states are topological states of the em field classified by a @xmath0 topological invariant .",
    "the frequency band structure of photonic crystals whose ( periodically repeated ) constituent scattering elements interact weakly with each other can be calculated by a means which is similar to the tight - binding method employed for atomic insulators and semiconductors .",
    "photonic bands amenable to a tight - binding - like description are e.g. , the bands stemming from the whispering - gallery modes of a lattice of high - index scatterers @xcite the defect bands of a sublattice of point defects , within a photonic crystal with an absolute band gap , @xcite the plasmonic bands of a lattice of metallic spheres @xcite or of a lattice of dielectric cavities within a metallic host .",
    "@xcite in the latter case , the frequency band structure stems from the weak interaction of the surface plasmons of each individual cavity @xcite wherein light propagates within the crystal volume by a hopping mechanism .",
    "such type of lattice constitutes the photonic analog of a topological crystalline insulator presented in this work whose frequency band structure will be revealed based on a photonic tight - binding treatment within the framework of the coupled - dipole method .",
    "@xcite the latter is an exact means of solving maxwell s equations in the presence of nonmagnetic scatterers .",
    "we consider a lattice of dielectric cavities within a lossless metallic host .",
    "the @xmath1-th cavity is represented by a dipole of moment @xmath2 which stems from an incident electric field @xmath3 and the field which is scattered by all the other cavities of the lattice . this way the dipole moments of all the cavities",

    "the cavity resonances within the @xmath12-plane and along the @xmath13-axis can be spectrally distinct ; thus , around the region of e.g. , the cavity resonance @xmath14 within the @xmath12-plane , @xmath15 ( see appendix ) . in this case , one can separate the em response within the @xmath12-plane from that along the @xmath13-axis and eq .",

    "( [ eq : g_elem ] ) in a form appropriate for a slab geometry .",
    "the emergence of surface states depends critically on the surface termination of the finite slab , i.e. , for different slab terminations different surface - state dispersions occur ( if occur at all ) . namely , we assume a finite slab parallel to the ( 001 ) surface ( characterized by the @xmath56 symmetry group ) consisting of 80 alternating @xmath63 layers except the last bilayer which is @xmath64 , i.e. , the layer sequence is @xmath65 .",
    "the corresponding frequency band structure along the symmetry lines of the surface brillouin zone of the ( 001 ) surface [ see fig .  [ fig1](c ) ] is shown in fig .",
    "it is evident that there exist gapless surface states within the band gap exhibiting a quadratic degeneracy at the @xmath66-point . in this case",
    ", the corresponding doublet of surface states can be described by an effective theory @xcite similarly to the doublet states at a point of linear degeneracy ( dirac point ) .",
    "@xcite    we note that the equivalence of the green s tensor @xmath67 with the atomic hamiltonian of ref .   as well as the form of the time - reversal @xmath68 and ( geometric ) @xmath56-rotation @xmath69 operators for the em problem @xcite which are the same as for spinless electrons , allows to describe the photonic band structure with the @xmath0 topological invariant @xmath70 @xmath71 where for real eigenvectors of @xmath72 we have @xcite @xmath73/ { \\rm pf}[w({\\bf k}_{1 } ) ] \\label{eq : pf_frac}\\ ] ] and @xmath74 @xmath75 stands for the pfaffian of a skew - symmetric matrix , i.e. , @xmath76^{2}=\\det(w)$ ] .",
    "due to the double degeneracy of the band structure at the four special momenta points @xmath77 the frequency bands come in doublets .",
    "since frequency eigenvectors with different eigenfrequencies are orthogonal , all the inter - pair elements of the @xmath78-matrix are zero and the latter is written as : @xmath79 where @xmath80 are anti - symmetric @xmath81 matrices , @xcite i.e. , @xmath82 or @xmath83 , where @xmath84 in this case , @xmath85=w^{1}_{12 } w^{2}_{12 } \\cdots w^{n}_{12}=\\pm 1 $ ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath86 and @xmath87 which ensures the presence of gapless surface states .",
    "we note that the above analysis relies on the assumption of real frequency bands .",
    "the presence of losses in the constituent materials renders the frequency bands complex , i.e. , the bloch wavevector possesses both a real and an imaginary part .",
    "however , even in this case , one can still speak of real frequency bands if the imaginary part of the bloch wavevector is at least _",
    "hundred _ times smaller than the corresponding real part .",
    "this a common criterion used in calculations of the complex frequency band structure by on - shell electromagnetic solvers such as the layer - multiple scattering method @xcite or the transfer - matrix method",
    "a possible realization of the photonic analogue of topological insulator in the laboratory is depicted in fig .",
    "since our model system requires dielectric cavities within a homogeneous plasma , a lattice of nano - cavities formed within a homogeneous drude - type metal , e.g. , a noble metal ( au , ag , cu ) , would be the obvious answer .",
    "@xcite however , the plasmon bands are extremely lossy due to the intrinsic absorption of noble metals in the visible regime .",
    "a solution to this would be the use of an _ artificial _ plasmonic medium operating in the microwave regime where metals are perfect conductors and losses are minimal .",
    "artificial plasma can be created by a 3d network of thin metallic wires of a few tens of @xmath88 m in diameter and spaced by a few mm .",
    "@xcite a lattice of dielectric particles within an artificial plasma can be modelled with the presented tight - binding green s tensor .",
    "since the interaction among first and second neighbors within the same bilayer ( @xmath52 or @xmath53 ) should depend on the dipole orientation ( in order to preserve the @xmath56 symmetry ) , the dielectric particles in each layer are connected with cylindrical waveguiding elements ( different in each layer @xmath52 or @xmath53 - see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , between two successive bilayers there are no such elements since interactions between dipoles belonging to different layers should be independent of the dipole orientations ( s orbital - like ) .",
    "another advantage of realizing the photonic analog in the microwave regime is the absence of nonlinearities in the em response of the constituent materials since photon - photon interactions may destroy the quadratic degeneracy of the surface bands in analogy with fermionic systems .",
    "@xcite    finally , we must stress that a photonic topological crystalline insulator can be also realized with purely dielectric materials if the host medium surrounding the cavities is not a plasmonic medium but a photonic crystal with an absolute band gap : the cavities would be point defects within the otherwise periodic photonic crystal and the tight - binding description would be still appropriate .",
    "@xcite in this case , maxwell s equations lack of any kind of characteristic length and the proposed analog would be realized in any length scale .",
    "in conclusion , a 3d lattice of weakly interacting cavities respecting tr symmetry and a certain point - group symmetry constitutes a photonic analog of a topological crystalline insulator by demonstrating a spectrum of gapless surface states .",
    "a possible experimental realization would be a 3d lattice of dielectric particles within a continuous network of thin metallic wires with a plasma frequency in the ghz regime .",
    "this work has been supported by the european community s seventh framework programme ( fp7/2007 - 2013 ) under grant agreement no .",
    "228455-nanogold ( self - organized nanomaterials for tailored optical and electrical properties ) .",
    "the @xmath13-component of the polarizability need not be zero but can assume finite values as far as the frequency band stemming from the surface - plasmon resonance corresponding to the z - component is spectrally distinct ( no overlap ) with the bands stemming from the @xmath12-components of the polarizability .",
    "in this case , one can treat separately the two frequency bands ( doublet ) stemming from the xy - resonance from the band coming from the z - resonance ( singlet ) .",
    "the above requirements can be quantified as follows , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the width of the @xmath12-frequency bands ( in dimensionless frequency units ) .",
    "@xmath90 is obtained from the first term of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_tensor ] ) of the paper . to a first approximation",
    ", it is given by @xcite @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , the condition ( [ eq : app_1 ] ) is written as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the lattice constant in the @xmath12-plane .",
    "given that @xmath95 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : app_3 ] ) becomes @xmath96 from the above equation it is evident that for a given value of the dielectric anisotropy @xmath97 , one can always find a suitably large lattice constant @xmath22 such that eq .",
    "( [ eq : app_5 ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "the latter allows the easy engineering of the photonic analog of a crystalline topological insulator since there is practically no restriction on the choice of the ( uniaxial ) material the cavities are made from .",

    "( [ eq : g_tensor ] ) holds , the same equation is true for the width @xmath98 of the singlet frequency band ( resulting from the @xmath13-resonance ) .    _ numerical example_. suppose that the cavities are made from a nematic liquid crystal which is a uniaxial material .",
