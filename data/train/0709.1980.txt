    "in the last 10 years various neutrino experiments made it clear that neutrinos have masses and lepton flavors mix @xcite . though the measurement of the values of @xmath4 and the cp phase @xmath5 as well as determining the neutrino mass hierarchy still elude us , there exist an array of experimental plans and ideas to make the goal .",
    "if successful they will bring us a more or less complete picture of how neutrinos organize their mass spectrum and how lepton flavors mix .",
    "when it happens , then , we will really be entering into the era of precision measurement of lepton mixing parameters .",
    "an intriguing question is whether this will serve just for precision measurements of more or less known quantities , or could help us to discover new physics beyond the standard model which is amended to incorporate neutrino masses and mixing .",
    "it has been suggested since long time ago that neutrinos may have non - standard interactions ( nsi ) in addition to those dictated by the standard model of electroweak interactions  @xcite .",
    "if there exists an energy scale for new physics at the tev range , it is conceivable that it produces higher dimension operators which affect the way how neutrinos interact with matter , the point raised in @xcite .",
    "it was argued that such nsi possessed by neutrinos need not be subject to the stringent constraints that the charged leptons have to obey @xcite .",
    "the existing constraints on nsi for neutrinos are worked out in @xcite .",
    "if we follow naive dimensional counting with four fermi operators the order of magnitude of nsi is expected to be @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) for the energy scale of new physics @xmath14 of @xmath15 ( 10 ) tev @xcite .",
    "if we want to probe into such a tiny effect of nsi in the neutrino sector , extremely high sensitivities are required for experiments to detect deviations from the standard three flavor oscillations .",
    "a large number of papers in the literature is devoted to discuss nsi in various context including long - baseline accelerator experiments , the atmospheric and the solar neutrino observations , and supernova neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to discuss the discovery potential of nsi in a neutrino factory .",
    "as is well known , a neutrino factory  @xcite is an ultimate apparatus for precision measurements of the lepton mixing parameters .",
    "because of the capability of clean detection of muons including the charge identification , its sensitivity to @xmath4 is expected to go down to an extremely small value , somewhere in the range @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "then , it is natural to think about neutrino factory as a discovery machine for nsi .",
    "one of the key issues in the discussion of the discovery reach of nsi is that we have to guarantee , at the same time , the ability of accurately measure the lepton mixing parameters , especially @xmath4 and @xmath5 , is left intact .",
    "however , it is a difficult goal to achieve in particular when we go down to very small values of @xmath4 and nsi contributions .",
    "in fact , it is known that the presence of nsi can confuse the measurement of @xmath4 by mimicking its effect  @xcite . unless this problem is somehow solved , it is difficult to think about a neutrino factory as a sensitive hunting tool for nsi and at the same time as a viable apparatus for precision measurements of the lepton mixing parameters .",
    "we do overcome the confusion problem by our set - up .",
    "we consider a two detector setting with baselines at @xmath2 km and at @xmath3 km @xcite , which will sometimes be referred as the intermediate and the far detectors , respectively .",
    "comparing the yields taken by the two detectors is the key to resolve the confusion .",
    "these features will be demonstrated in secs .",
    "[ zero - input ] and [ nonzero - input ] .",
    "we must note , however , that it is only by keeping the solar @xmath17 terms that one can gain access to the cp phase @xmath5 which is crucial to resolve the muddle between @xmath4 and nsi .",
    "therefore , we keep the solar @xmath18 terms throughout our analytical and numerical treatment .    if the two detector setting is a special requirement for hunting nsi it would not be easy to implement it into the project . fortunately , it is _ not _ the case . it has been suggested  @xcite that combining measurements by detectors at two baselines , one at 3000 - 4000 km and the other at @xmath197000 km , is powerful enough to resolve the parameter degeneracy @xcite associated with the measurement of the lepton mixing parameters , a notorious obstacle to its precision determination .",
    "the power of the two detector setting has been confirmed also by more recent analysis @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ nsi ] , we present the general framework for probing nsi through neutrino propagation in matter by switching on two nsi contributions simultaneously and discuss some important points about nsi effects in the @xmath20/@xmath21 oscillation probabilities , the channels explored in this paper . in sec .  [ synergy ] , we elucidate the powerfulness of the strategy to look for nsi in a neutrino factory by combining the measurements of two identical detectors at different baselines .",

    "[ conclusion ] is devoted to our final concluding remarks . in appendix",
    "[ derivation ] , we give details on the derivation of the appearance probability @xmath20 in the presence of two nsi parameters .",

    "@xmath26 stands for a projection operator and is either @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",

    ", we consider the effect of nsi in neutrino propagation in matter .",
    "it is known that nsi can affect production and detection processes of neutrinos so that a complete treatment must involve also the latter two effects .",
    "however , we should note that the muon storage ring which we assume as a source of neutrinos is special as it is one of the cleanest .",
    "muon decay has been studied with great precision and room for nsi is smallest among the sources @xcite . because construction of the muon storage ring will require an intense muon source , we assume that the already tight constraints on nsi by muon decay would become much more stringent at that time . therefore , we believe that to neglect nsi in the production of neutrinos in fact gives a fair approximation , unless we go down to extremely small values of @xmath31 .    with regard to nsi at the detection this may be more debatable .",
    "however , we call the readers attention to the fact that upon construction of the neutrino factory the near detector sitting in front of the storage ring will give a severe bound on nsi @xcite",
    ". we also remark that even before that era several low energy neutrino experiments may be able to place equally severe constraints on nsi @xcite .",
    "the bounds from them are placed on the product of nsi at the source and the detection .",
    "but if the constraint on nsi by muon decays is strongly constrained , this will translate into a stringent bound on nsi at the detection .",
    "furthermore , since we compare two identical detectors , at the intermediate ( @xmath2 km ) and the far ( @xmath3 km ) location , the nsi effect at detectors tend to cancel .",
    "therefore , our approximation of ignoring nsi at the detection points may give a reasonable first approximation .",
    "to discuss the effects of nsi during neutrino propagation in matter we will use the effective coefficients @xmath31 as it is traditional in this field .",
    "they are defined as @xmath32 . where @xmath33 is the number density of the fermion species @xmath24 in matter .",
    "normalizing by the electron number density @xmath34 leads to a simple structure of the effective hamiltonian which governs the neutrino propagation in matter .",

    "we collectively denote their order of magnitude as @xmath59 under the hope that no confusion arises with the nsi elements @xmath6 .",

    "we notice that @xmath6 comes in via three different ways :    \\(a ) @xmath6 comes into the formula with its phase , @xmath65 , in the form @xmath66 together with the leptonic kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) phase @xmath5 in the mns matrix .",

    "we suggest an intuitive understanding of the fact that two phases come together when @xmath71 is switched off .",
    "the system without @xmath71 contains effectively only two generations of neutrinos and on physics ground the cp violating phase should be unique . therefore , the phase of @xmath6 and the km phase @xmath5 must come together . from this reasoning",

    ", we expect that confusions occur in the experimental settings for which ignoring the solar @xmath71 gives a fair approximation .",

    "these features are in fact observed for @xmath56 in @xcite .",
    "we note that the symmetry under simultaneous shift of @xmath76 and @xmath5 by the same amount but with opposite signs is a symmetry of the whole system at the magic baseline .",
    "we will see that this confusion shows up in our analysis .",

    "it is obtained by replacing @xmath117 by @xmath118 in the second line of eq .",

    "it explains the identical behavior of the probabilities with @xmath56 and @xmath95 seen in the second and the third upper panels in fig .",
    "[ bi - pmagic ] .",
    "the ellipse in these panels shrink approximately to a line because there is only @xmath121 dependence in the probability where @xmath122 denotes the phase of @xmath123 .",

    "[ bi - pmagic ] are unchanged even when @xmath122 is varied .",

( [ pemu_magic - etau ] ) . with the values of the parameters used ( e=30 gev , l = 7200 km , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 ) it can be estimated as @xmath127 , which is in perfect agreement with the length of the shrunk middle ellipse projected onto @xmath52 axis in fig .",
    "[ bi - pmagic ] .",
    "therefore , we have understood the qualitative features of the flat ellipse at the magic baseline as well as its size .",
    "we can also understand the reason why the effect of @xmath128 and @xmath96 are suppressed by deriving a similar formula which contains one of them in an analogous way as in appendix  [ derivation ] .",

    "the three representative values of @xmath106 used are also the same as in fig .",
    "[ bi - pmagic ] .",
    "we immediately notice several clear differences .",
    "first of all , the effect of @xmath5 is large at @xmath2 km for both cases with and without nsi , as indicated by the blue and the red lines ( with nsi ) and by the green ellipses as well as by wide span of the ellipses indicated by the orange region ( without nsi ) .",
    "the ellipses with nsi , except for the case with @xmath56 , are buried into this region .",
    "this is clearly the cause of the problem of confusion between @xmath4 and @xmath7 s one encounters when one tries to measure @xmath4 and @xmath5 allowing for nsi ; the system with @xmath7 s can mimic the one with different values of @xmath4 but without nsi . in fig .",
    "[ bi - p3000 ] the difference between the confused parameters and the genuine ones are small , apart from the @xmath56 case , because we take small values of @xmath7 s .",
    "it is also notable that the effect of the sign of the @xmath7 s is not quite visible , which is nothing but a consequence of the two - phase degeneracy as explained in sec .",
    "[ 2epsilon ] .",
    "( see sec .",
    "[ degeneracy ] for more about the degeneracy . )",
    "when we try to determine the values of @xmath7 s it is also a bad news because there can be a severe confusion between nsi and the standard oscillation effect with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we will see in secs .",
    "[ zero - input ] and [ nonzero - input ] that this confusion for @xmath7 determination is much severer than that in @xmath131 determination at @xmath2 km , which will be manifested as a complicated island structure in the allowed region . on the other hand ,",

    "[ bi - p3000 ] .",

    "these consideration naturally suggest the possibility of combining the intermediate and the far detectors to determine simultaneously nsi parameters at the same time measuring @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    the markedly different behavior of the bi - probability plots between the @xmath56 and @xmath95 systems at @xmath132 km can be traced back to the difference between the third terms in the analytic formulas ( [ penu-2nd_etau ] ) and ( [ penu-2nd_emu ] ) .",
    "we should note that the almost identical behavior between the systems with @xmath56 and @xmath95 at @xmath3 km , and the marked difference between them at @xmath85 km makes it interesting by itself to compare their sensitivities at these two baselines and when they are combined .",
    "we will see later that sensitivity to @xmath56 is essentially determined by the effect at @xmath2 km whereas that to @xmath56 is determined by the combination of @xmath2 km and 7000 km .",

    "but , it is nice to see that it actually occurs in the concrete two detector setting adopted in this paper .",
    "we want to make brief remarks on the conventional parameter degeneracy @xcite which would affect the sensitivity to the lepton mixing parameter .",
    "it might also affect the sensitivity to nsi through its effect to @xmath222 and @xmath5 .",
    "first of all , there is no @xmath119 octant degeneracy because @xmath119 is held fixed to @xmath172 in our analysis . with regard to the four - fold @xmath131 degeneracy duplicated by the unknown sign of @xmath223",
    "we have no hint for its existence in our analysis , apart from some limited cases at @xmath224 which might be affected by it .",
    "the reason for this observation is that the clone solutions have a significantly different value of @xmath5 from the true solution ( very roughly speaking @xmath225 ) , in both the intrinsic and the sign-@xmath223 degeneracies .",
    "nonetheless , from the figures we presented ( and also in all those not shown ) these is no such clone region .",
    "the reasons are : ( 1 ) the intrinsic degeneracy is resolved by the spectrum information , and ( 2 ) with long enough baselines the mass hierarchy is determined .",
    "therefore , we suspect that the conventional parameter degeneracy plays minor role , if any , in our sensitivity analysis , except for the one associated with @xmath119 which we do not consider in this work .",
    "in this section we try to summarize the sensitivities to nsi , @xmath4 and @xmath5 that can be achieved by a neutrino factory with the intermediate - far detector setting .",
    "however , in looking for ways to present the sensitivities , we recognized that the sensitivities depend very much on the input values of @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , we need to show the sensitivities as a function of both @xmath5 and @xmath4 simultaneously . in figs .",
    "[ epsilon - sens1]-[th13-sens ] we have presented the equi - uncertainty contours of a particular observable @xmath226 in the plane spanned by the input values of @xmath106 and @xmath5 .",
    "we have defined the uncertainty of measuring ( or constraining ) the observable @xmath226 as @xmath227 , except for the case of @xmath106 , where we give the fractional uncertainty , i.e. @xmath228 . for all cases we present the 2@xmath10 cl ( 2 dof ) contours .",
    "the sensitivity to the nsi parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be determined in the analysis of the 6 combinations of nsi elements we have examined in this work : @xmath202 , @xmath206 , @xmath201 , @xmath205 , @xmath229 and @xmath47 .",
    "therefore we need altogether 12 panels to fully present the sensitivities to the @xmath7 s , and 12 panels present the sensitivities to the standard oscillation parameters @xmath4 ( 6 panels ) and @xmath5 ( 6 panels ) .",
    "we show , for definiteness , the case the nsi parameters have zero ( vanishingly small ) input values .",
    "but , as we saw in sec .  [ nonzero - input ] , the results would not be so different even if we had taken non - zero input values for the nsi . prior to showing the sensitivity contours we wish to warn the readers ; some of the structures are due to the finite grid used in our calculation , so the precise shape of the contours may not be reliable .",
    "let us first look at figs .",
    "[ epsilon - sens1 ] and [ epsilon - sens2 ] where we show the sensitivity to the nsi parameters . roughly speaking , for",
    "the typical value @xmath230 the sensitivity to @xmath231 and @xmath56 are @xmath19 10 - 20% , 2 - 10% , 0.1 - 0.4% and 0.01 - 0.04% , respectively .",
    "as we have discussed in previous sections , the off - diagonal nsi parameters have a much more significant impact than that of the diagonal ones .",
    "we confirm here that in fact , they can be significantly more constrained by data .",
    "we observe that the sensitivity to the off - diagonal nsi parameters is basically not affected by the presence of another non - zero nsi contribution , whereas this is not true for the sensitivity to the diagonal elements .",
    "we suspect that this comportment may continue to be true even if more nsi parameters are switched on simultaneously .",
    "some of the features of these contours can be readily understood from the bi - probability plots in fig .",
    "[ bi - pmagic ] .",
    "for example , from panel ( b2 ) of fig .",
    "[ epsilon - sens1 ] and panels ( d2 ) and ( f1 ) of fig .",
    "[ epsilon - sens2 ] , we observe that the sensitivity to @xmath183 is best at @xmath232 and @xmath203 and worst at @xmath233 and @xmath104 .",

    "[ bi - pmagic ] , namely , the points in @xmath234 space corresponding to @xmath233 ( square ) and @xmath195 ( diamond ) with non - zero @xmath183 can be confused with that of the standard case without nsi effect ( orange strip ) .",
    "one can also understand that this behavior does not depend on @xmath4 .    despite the contours for @xmath94",

    "[ bi - pmagic ] that the best sensitivity should be for @xmath235 and worse for @xmath236 .",
    "this is also confirmed by panels ( a1 ) , ( b1 ) and ( c1 ) of fig .",
    "[ epsilon - sens1 ] .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath192 shows an intricate dependence on @xmath5 and @xmath4 as seen in fig .",
    "[ epsilon - sens1](a2 ) and figs .",
    "[ epsilon - sens2](d1 ) and ( e1 ) .",
    "the sensitivity is the worst at around @xmath237 and @xmath238 for @xmath239 , and at around @xmath240 for @xmath230 . at @xmath241 ,",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath192 has no significant dependence on @xmath5 .",
    "let us understand the cause of such complicated features .",
    "first of all , the sensitivity to @xmath192 is coming dominantly from the measurement at 3000 km , as indicted in figs .",
    "[ ee - em - mm - piby4 ] , [ ee - em - et-3piby2 ] and [ ee - em - mm-3piby2 - 0.0001 ] .",
    "then , it should be possible to understand the behavior at @xmath230 from the bi - probability plot give in fig.[bi - p3000 ] .",
    "this is indeed the case ; the upper middle panel of the bi - probability plot shows that the ellipses of positive and negative @xmath192 as well as the one without nsi overlap with each other at @xmath236 , and hence the sensitivity is worst at @xmath236 . the similar bi - probability plot for @xmath239 ( not shown ) indicates that a positive , negative , and zero @xmath192 ellipses meet at @xmath242 and @xmath243 .",
    "( precise values of the crossing point are at around @xmath244 and @xmath245 . ) at @xmath241 ( not shown ) there is no particular value of @xmath5 at which these ellipses overlap .",

    "we conclude that the difference between the sensitivities to @xmath5 with and without nsi is not dramatic .    on the other hand , regarding the sensitivity to @xmath100 , comparing the lower panel of fig .",

    "again we conclude that the impact of nsi in the determination of @xmath4 is not so striking .",
    "we have demonstrated in this paper that a neutrino factory equipped with an intense neutrino flux from a muon storage ring and two detectors , one located at @xmath2 km and the other at @xmath3 km , is powerful enough to probe into extremely small values of the nsi parameters .",

    "six different combinations of the two @xmath7 systems that can be obtained from the four nsi parameters , @xmath31 with @xmath254 being @xmath255 , @xmath256 , @xmath257 and @xmath258 , are analyzed under the assumption of ignoring the effects of nsi at the production and the detection of neutrinos .",
    "the sensitivities to off - diagonal @xmath7 s are excellent , @xmath259 and @xmath260 and while the ones for the diagonal @xmath7 s are acceptable , @xmath261 at 3@xmath10 cl and 2 dof .",
    "these sensitivities remain more or less independent of @xmath4 down to extremely small values such as @xmath224 .",
    "they seem also very robust in the sense that they are not very disturbed by the presence of another non - zero nsi contribution .",
    "the above characteristics of the sensitivities to nsi suggest that in our setting the off - diagonal @xmath7 s are likely the best place to discover nsi .",
    "we note that these results are obtained under the assumption of ignoring background as well as systematic errors in our analysis .",
    "according to our estimate , however , the effect of inclusion of them is limited to @xmath262% ( a factor of 2 ) or so for @xmath4 as small as @xmath194 ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "one of the most significant features of the results obtained in our analysis is that the presence of nsi _ does not _ confuses the precision measurement of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the favorite property arises from the synergy between the two detectors placed at the two different baselines ; the detector at the magic baseline is extremely ( reasonably ) sensitive to the off - diagonal ( diagonal ) @xmath7 s but lack sensitivity to @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "the intermediate detector at @xmath2 km _ is _ sensitive to @xmath5 , while lacking good sensitivity to @xmath7 s ( except in the case of @xmath56 ) .",
    "we have shown in sec .",
    "[ zero - input ] and [ nonzero - input ] that , when combined , the synergy between the two detectors has an enormous power to resolve the confusion between @xmath4 and nsi .",
    "moreover , the impact of the systematic errors on @xmath5 and @xmath4 is limited especially at small @xmath4 and at most @xmath1910%-20% level at @xmath263 .",
    "we believe that the results obtained in this paper open the door to the possibility of using neutrino factory as a discovery machine for nsi .    our analysis in this paper , however , has limitations of validity because we have assumed that the effects of nsi in production and the detection processes are negligible .",
    "it may be a self - consistent approximation when we discuss the @xmath95 system , assuming a very small @xmath95 , because its effect on muon decay is expected to be small .",
    "but , if we discuss the @xmath56 system it affects the production and the detection processes at one - loop level and all these effects have to be consistently dealt with . in this paper",
    "we are not able to address this point .",
