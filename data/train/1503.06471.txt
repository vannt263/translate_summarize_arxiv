    "the galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) g349.7@xmath00.2 has been long suggested to be on the edge of the milky way ( @xmath222 kpc ) , following the hi absorption measurements @xcite and the oh ( 1720 mhz ) maser observations @xcite .",
    "recently , based on a better understanding of the galactic center s structure and using the 1420 mhz radio continuum and 21 cm hi emission data sets from the southern galactic plane survey , @xcite estimated the distance of g349.7@xmath00.2 to be @xmath211.5 kpc .    in the radio waveband , the central spectral index value of @xmath10.47 @xmath4 0.06 suggests that g349.7@xmath00.2 is a shell - type snr .",
    "however , due to the enhancements towards the eastern and southern parts of its 25 diameter shell , it was found to be an unusual shell - type snr lacking a central cavity and a ring - like structure @xcite .    in x - rays , g349.7@xmath00.2 was first detected in the galactic plane survey of _ asca _ @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the _ asca _ data @xcite showed that the spectrum was well fit by a single - temperature non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) model and they estimated the age of g349.7@xmath00.2 to be @xmath22800 yr .",
    "@xcite analyzed the _",
    "chandra _ data of the whole snr as well as six spectral regions of the remnant .",
    "the spectrum of the whole snr was fit by two thermal components : a high - temperature plasma ( @xmath21.4 kev ) in nei with an enhanced si abundance and a low - temperature plasma ( @xmath20.8 kev ) in ionization equilibrium .",
    "unlike the whole snr spectrum , the spectra from individual snr regions were well fit with a single - temperature thermal model .",
    "observations also revealed a compact central object inside the snr shell , called cxou j171801.0@xmath1372617 .",
    "the x - ray morphology was found to be very similar to the radio morphology , thereby giving a hint of an expansion into a region with large density gradients as it is shown by the @xmath5co observations @xcite .",
    "five oh maser spots were found in the velocity range of 14.3 and 16.9 km s@xmath6 inside g349.7@xmath00.2 showing clear evidence of interaction between the snr and the molecular clouds ( mcs ) @xcite . the magnetic field at the brightest maser",
    "is measured to be 350 @xmath4 50 @xmath7 g @xcite .",
    "the velocities of these oh maser spots are in agreement with the velocity of the shocked mc @xcite and the velocity of the far 3 kpc arm @xcite .    molecular line transitions found at similar velocities of those of the oh masers and the shock - excited near - infrared h@xmath8 emission hints that the snr - mc interaction is happening toward the center of the snr @xcite . by looking at the co data and the results of the hi absorption analysis",
    ", @xcite concluded that the clouds with a velocity of 16.5 km s@xmath6 are behind g349.7@xmath00.2 and that they are shocked by the snr , where the interaction gives rise to near - infrared h@xmath8 emission and the oh maser emission .",
    "it has been suggested that all maser - emitting ( me ) snrs could be of the mixed - morphology ( mm ) class @xcite .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that the x - ray morphology of g349.7@xmath00.2 is not centrally peaked .",
    "it was suggested that this morphology can be explained by the projection effect model by @xcite , which assumes a shell - like evolution of an snr at the edge of an mc , where the ambient density gradient does not lie in the projection plane .",
    "so it is highly likely that the g349.7@xmath00.2 is expanding into a density gradient with an angle of @xmath245@xmath9 , rather than expanding along the direction of the density gradient .    in gamma rays ,",
    "mm snrs interacting with mcs were among the first snrs detected by the large area telescope ( lat ) on board _ fermi gamma ray space telescope _",
    "( _ fermi_-lat ) .",
    "the gamma - ray luminosities of mm snrs were found to be much higher than that of other detected snrs , i.e. @xmath210@xmath10@xmath110@xmath11 erg s@xmath6 for ic443 , w28 , w51c , w44 , w49b , and 3c391 @xcite .",
    "interactions of these mm snrs with mcs were clearly shown by the detection of 1720 mhz oh masers @xcite and near - infrared h@xmath8 and [ feii ] lines @xcite .    for g349.7@xmath00.2 , @xcite reported a @xmath210@xmath3 detection of gev gamma rays toward the position of g349.7@xmath00.2 from the data collected by _ fermi_-lat .",
    "no evidence of spatial extension was found and a power - law fit to the gamma - ray data gave a spectral index of @xmath12 = @xmath12.10 @xmath4 0.11 .",
    "the shape of the gamma - ray spectrum showed a steepening of the spectral index after a few gev .",
    "so , a fit to an exponential power - law function resulted in a slightly better fit with a cut - off energy of @xmath216.5 gev and spectral index of @xmath12 = @xmath11.74 @xmath4 0.37 . in tev energies , @xcite reported the detection of g349.7@xmath00.2 at 6.6@xmath3 and found the tev flux at roughly 0.7% of the crab nebula s gamma - ray flux with a spectral index of 2.8 @xmath4 0.27@xmath13 @xmath4 0.20@xmath14 .",
    "mm snrs interacting with mcs are primary targets for the detection of gamma rays of hadronic origin @xcite , where two gamma rays are produced from the decay of a neutral pion ( @xmath15 ) created in a proton - proton interaction while the snr shock passes through a dense molecular material .",
    "the gamma - ray spectra of these snrs fall steeply below 250 mev and at energies greater than 1",
    "gev they trace the parent proton energy distribution @xcite .",
    "in addition to the fact that g349.7@xmath00.2 is an me snr and shows a high gamma - ray luminosity ( @xmath210@xmath10 erg s@xmath6 ) in the gev energy range @xcite , there are other clues which may support the mm - nature of g349.7@xmath00.2 , namely , the gamma - ray spectrum being dominated by the hadronic emission component and the x - ray spectrum presenting overionized ( recombining ) plasma features .    in recombining snrs , the ionization temperature is higher than the electron temperature .",
    "this overionized plasma is a signature of rapid electron cooling .",
    "the existence of recombining plasma ( rp ) was discovered in ic443 and w49b during the x - ray studies of _ asca _ on six mm snrs @xcite . additionally , the x - ray imaging spectrometer , xis , @xcite onboard _ suzaku _",
    "@xcite has discovered strong radiative recombination continuum ( rrc ) features from the following mm snrs : ic443 , w49b , g359.1 - 0.5 , w28 , w44 , g346.6 - 0.2 , 3c 391 , and g290.1 - 0.8 @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite studied g349.7@xmath00.2 using _ suzaku _ data .",
    "they found that the spectrum of the whole snr was well described by two optically thin thermal plasmas : a low - temperature ( @xmath20.6 kev ) plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) and a high - temperature ( @xmath21.24 kev ) plasma in nei .",
    "the low temperature plasma has solar metal abundances suggesting that the emission is dominated by the interstellar material .",

    "the progenitor of the g349.7@xmath00.2 has exploded within a large ringlike co shell ( seen as the color - coded arc structure in figure [ figure_6 ] ) , a remnant of an older sn explosion containing denser clumps of mcs .",
    "the explosion probably happened within the inter - clump gas @xcite of the co shell , at a location between the edge of the co shell and an mc clump inside this shell . in our interpretation",
    "we assume that while the snr s shell was expanding , a small section of it broke out of the co shell boundary and entered the rarefied interstellar medium ( ism ) moving in a direction toward the observer .",
    "the x - ray morphology of g349.7@xmath00.2 is similar to the radio image consisting of a two - ring structure , where one ring is smaller and brighter than the other",
    ". the smaller ring might be the part of the snr shock front entering into a higher density region , an mc clump called as ` cloud1 ' by @xcite , and interacting with it .",
    "the shock of g349.7@xmath00.2 entering ` cloud1 ' was confirmed to be of type c , which allows oh 1720 mhz masers to form @xcite .",
    "the larger ring structure represents the snr shock expanding into the relatively less denser medium of the co shell .",
    "therefore , we calculated the proton density for two regions : one having a radius of 0@xmath23.015 corresponding to the inner smaller ring , and another one with a radius of 0@xmath23.022 representing the larger outer ring .",
    "the smaller ring radius was chosen such that it covers the highest number of x - ray counts ( shown with the innermost blue contour for @xmath33540 cts in figure [ figure_6 ] ) .",
    "this region coincides mostly with the e region of the snr selected in the x - ray analysis ( section 2.1.3 ) .",
    "the larger ring was chosen to include the x - ray contour representing the x - ray counts higher than 365 , where the w region is also partially covered .",
    "both rings are within the 10@xmath3 contours of gev gamma - ray ts distribution . to calculate the average proton density within the regions surrounded by these two rings",
    ", we first estimated the size of the emission regions to be @xmath23 and @xmath24.5 pc using the distance to the snr to be 11.5 kpc .",
    "then assuming a spherical geometry of the emission region , the proton density ( n ) corresponding to the inner and outer ring region was found to be 81 and 35 @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "to understand whether the leptonic or hadronic scenario is dominating the sed of g349.7@xmath00.2 , we started the multi - wavelength modeling assuming a bpl type of spectra for both the electron and proton distributions inside the source :    @xmath35    where e@xmath36 is the electron or proton energy and e@xmath37 is the spectral break energy with the spectral index changing from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "e@xmath40 is the maximum energy of electrons or protons . n@xmath41 and n@xmath42 are normalization constants .    for the multi - wavelength modeling we used the radio data @xcite and the gamma - ray data from _ fermi_-lat and h.e.s.s .",
    "the h.e.s.s .",
    "flux data points @xcite are shown in magenta color in figure [ figure_7 ] . during the fitting procedure we took e@xmath40 as 10 tev for protons and 2 tev for electrons .",
    "the value of e@xmath40 was chosen such that it would not cause the spectra of bremsstrahlung and inverse - compton ( ic ) overestimate the tev fluxes , when they are considered the dominant models for explaining the data .",
    "similarly , e@xmath40 for protons was chosen such that the hadronic model does not overestimate the tev fluxes .",
    "we first considered a purely leptonic model to explain the observed fluxes from radio wavelengths to gamma rays . in the case of leptonic model , bremsstrahlung and ic emission processes @xcite were used for explaining the gev@xmath1tev data .",
    "the total energetics of the electrons and protons need to be known to estimate the electron to proton ratio , defined as the ratio of dne / de and dnp / de at e = 10 gev , and the different model contributions .",
    "we first estimated the bremsstrahlung spectrum using a fixed value of ambient proton density .",
    "parameters of the leptonic model then were adjusted in such a way that the bremsstrahlung spectrum could explain the observed fluxes at gev@xmath1tev energies .",
    "these parameters then were fixed and they were used in computing the ic and synchrotron spectra of the leptonic model . to explain the observed radio fluxes , the magnetic field was adjusted to get radio synchrotron spectrum .",
    "using the same ambient proton density we estimated the hadronic contribution to gamma - ray spectrum resulting from the decay of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "secondly , we repeated a similar procedure for the case of ic process as the dominant model explaining the observed fluxes at gev@xmath1tev energies . and at last , we considered the @xmath43-decay model dominating among all the processes , which is a purely hadronic model @xcite .",
    "the parameters used for all three dominating processes are shown in table [ table_5 ] for the two ambient proton densities of 35 and 81 @xmath34 derived in section [ molen ] .",
    "[ table_5 ]    since the ambient proton density of 81 @xmath34 represents the interaction region corresponding to the smaller and brighter snr shell , including the five oh masers , the modeling results for this density will be important in terms of giving us clues about the proton spectrum .",
    "the best - fit parameters for the proton spectrum were obtained by a @xmath44-fitting procedure to the flux points .",

    "the best - fit gamma - ray spectrum resulting from the decay of @xmath15 is shown in the bottom panel of figure [ figure_7 ] with the red solid line .",
    "the estimated total energy can be written as w@xmath49 @xmath48 3.13 @xmath24 10@xmath50 erg , where @xmath51 is the effective gas number density for p - p collision .",
    "g349.7@xmath00.2 is an example of an me snr having an irregular shell that lacks central cavity in radio wavelengths @xcite , where the radio morphology is very similar to the one in x - rays . in both wavelengths",
    "the e side of the snr is brighter .",
    "the most likely explanation for g349.7 + 0.2 not exhibiting a typical mm morphology is because we are likely seeing this snr expanding into a density medium with a large density gradient of an angle of @xmath245@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the progenitor ( @xmath235@xmath140 m@xmath52 ) of g349.7@xmath00.2 possibly exploded within the ring - like co shell having an average density of 35 @xmath34 , where the location of the explosion may be between a dense mc clump and the boundary separating the co shell from the ism .",
    "the radio continuum morphology shows two rings , where the smaller ring representing the part of the shell expanding into the higher density medium of the mc clump .",
    "while this part of the snr shell might be expanding in the direction away from the observer , it is interacting with the mc clump producing 1720 mhz oh maser emission .",
    "the side of the snr shell expanding towards the observer , on the other hand , is moving into a less dense region inside the co shell and a smaller section of it might break out of the co shell into the ism .    the stellar wind of the progenitor forms a cie plasma in the dense circumstellar medium ( csm ) .",
    "when the blast wave breaks out of the dense csm and expands adiabatically into a cavity or into the rarefied ism , it causes rapid cooling and the formation of the rp @xcite .",
    "so , we would expect the electron cooling for g349.7@xmath00.2 to happen through the adiabatic expansion mechanism , when a part of the shell closer to the observer has expanded into a lower density co shell and then broke out into the rarefied ism .",
    "we searched for rrc in the _ suzaku _ data from the e and w regions of g349.7@xmath00.2 .",
    "however , we did not detect any rp features in their spectra .",
    "the total column density calculated from the atomic and molecular gas data was obtained from a circular region covering the x - ray remnant and it was found as n(total ) = 7.1 @xmath24 10@xmath31 @xmath26 , where @xmath53 value of the e and w regions ( table [ table_1 ] ) were found to be higher than the n(total ) value . the column density value calculated for the e region of g349.7@xmath00.2",
    "was found to be lower than the @xmath53 value for the w region , while the w region represents the portion of the snr shell expanding inside the co shell in other directions .",

    "analysis revealed the enhanced ejecta emission of si , ca , and fe in the e region pointing to the reverse shock produced by the snr - mc interactions .    to understand whether the dominating gamma - ray emission model for g349.7@xmath00.2 is leptonic or hadronic , we modeled all of the emission processes at gev energies individually .",
    "we have adjusted the model parameters to explain the observed fluxes such that we get a set of parameters for each different dominant process . however , some of the parameters estimated were either non - physical or inconsistent with the observed values . based on these parameters , we could get some insight into the emission mechanisms inside g349.7@xmath00.2 .    for the case of bremsstrahlung dominated model , the estimated electron to proton ratio was found to be much higher than the value ( @xmath20.01 ) observed on earth . in the case of ic process , we found that the number of ambient proton density has to be less than or equal to 0.1 , which is inconsistent with the measured proton density values reported in this paper .",
    "moreover , electron to proton ratio was found to be much higher than the observed value .",
    "therefore , both of these leptonic emission processes are insufficient to explain the observed gamma - ray fluxes .    in the case of hadronic model , we considered observed electron to proton ratio to be about 0.01 , and found that the hadronic model could explain the observed fluxes well without having any inconsistency in the model parameters .",

    "in order to explain the reported gev - tev gamma - ray flux of g349.7@xmath00.2 , @xcite estimated that the total proton energy is unreasonably large for an ambient proton density of 1.7 @xmath34 .",
    "as a result , they concluded that the tev gamma - ray emission possibly can not arise from the whole snr shell , but from a region where the snr is interacting with an mc .",

    "they also reported that a leptonic model is strongly disfavored when trying to explain the observed gamma - ray spectrum .",

    "finding rrc features and gamma rays dominated by the hadronic emission would strongly suggest that g349.7@xmath00.2 is an mm type snr .",
    "we found that g349.7@xmath00.2 has a gamma - ray spectrum , which is likely hadronic in nature , but lacks rp plasma .",
    "g349.7@xmath00.2 is expanding in a dense medium of mcs and emitting gamma rays by interacting with clumps of molecular material .",
    "we analyzed gev gamma rays from g349.7@xmath00.2 and found that the observed gamma - ray spectrum is likely hadronic in origin and is following the spectrum of parent protons , a bpl distribution with spectral index parameters of @xmath38 = 1.89 and @xmath39 = 2.42 and a spectral break at @xmath212 gev .",
    "this suggests that protons are accelerated to high energies , possibly at the region of snr shell interacting with the dense mc clump .",
    "although the best - fit location of the gamma - ray emission is slightly offset from the center of the x - ray remnant , it is closer to the e region .",
    "both the locations of the five oh masers and the whole e region of the x - ray remnant are within the 10@xmath3 contours of the gev gamma - ray ts distribution .",
    "the low breaking energy of the proton spectrum can be explained either by higher energy protons being already escaped through the crushed mc or the snr shell at the earlier evolutionary stages of the snr , or by the snr shock expanding in a dense medium being slowed down by this medium .",
    "we searched for rp in g349.7@xmath00.2 , whose mm - nature is still unclear , by studying the plasma structure of two of its regions using the _ suzaku _ data .",
    "we found that the plasma in the e region is in ionization equilibrium , while the plasma in the w region is in the nei state , showing that none of these regions are in the rp phase .",
