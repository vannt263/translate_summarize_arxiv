    "many dark energy models have been suggested to explain the recent acceleration of the universe , first indicated by snia observations @xcite .",
    "the nature of dark energy is one of the major problems in cosmology .",
    "theories in which gravity is modified as well as parametrizations of the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) @xmath18 , where @xmath11 is the pressure ( energy density ) of the dark energy , have been suggested @xcite . based on observations ,",
    "various constraints have been put on the eos for a variety of models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we begin by analyzing two interesting models that have been suggested for modifying gravity , which allow for a description of dark energy in terms of an effective eos .",
    "the first is the five - dimensional brane - world model ( bwm ) of defayet et al .",
    "@xcite , where gravity is modified by adding a five - dimensional einstein - hilbert action that dominates at distances which are greater than the crossover distance @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the planck mass and @xmath21 is a five - dimensional planck mass .",
    "the second model is the vacuum metamorphosis model ( vmm ) of parker and raval @xcite , which assumes the existence of a quantized non - interacting scalar field coupled to the ricci scalar curvature . in the vmm ,",
    "the quantum vacuum undergoes a phase transition at a redshift @xmath22 : from a zero value at @xmath23 to a non - zero value for @xmath24 .",
    "linder @xcite analyzed the linear growth of a density perturbation @xmath25 and the gravitational potential for both of these models , comparing them with the simplest linear parametrization of the dark energy eos as a function of @xmath10 : @xmath26 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are constants and @xmath10 is the cosmological scale factor .",
    "measurements of the present density fluctuations @xmath1 , derived from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies in the @xmath2cdm model , have been compared with those derived from the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) @xcite .",
    "it was found that their difference @xmath27 is no more than @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we recently showed that an agreement within @xmath0 ( i.e. , @xmath28 ) of the two sets of @xmath1 puts strong limits on a possible decay of the vacuum energy into cdm @xcite .",
    "here we make a similar analysis to show that the bwm and the vmm as dark energy candidates can be discarded , in the face of the present evidence that @xmath29 , the matter density @xmath3 and that the universe is flat , indicated by recent cmb data .",
    "we use the agreement to within @xmath0 of the present observed @xmath1 between the cmb and galaxy distribution ( gd ) data and the constraints from the gold snia data @xcite to restrict the parameters of the eos , @xmath26 .",
    "in particular , we analyze a model suggested by supergravity ( sugra ) @xcite , studied by linder @xcite and recently by solevi et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in @xmath30",
    "ii , we discuss the effect of dark energy on the linear growth of @xmath25 in the models : 1 )  the vacuum energy decay into cdm ; 2 )  the bwm and vmm ; 3 )  dark energy models parametrized by @xmath26 ; and 4 )  the sugra model .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section iii .",
    "the nature of dark energy is still unknown and there are many alternative models to explain it .",
    "one possibility is that instead of a constant vacuum energy , described by a cosmological constant , we have a vacuum energy which is decaying .",
    "other possibilities are models that modify gravity and phenomenological models that parametrize the dark energy eos in the form @xmath31 , setting values for @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in this section , all of the above models will be analyzed .",
    "for these models , the friedmann equation can be written in a general form in terms of an effective eos @xcite .",

    "the eos @xmath36 for the dark energy can be written as @xmath37    the linear growth of a density fluctuation , @xmath38 , depends on the eos .",
    "we define the growth factor @xmath39 , where @xmath40 , the cosmological scale factor , and @xmath41 is normalized to unity at @xmath42 , the recombination epoch . in terms of @xmath41",
    ", we have @xmath43\\frac{g^{\\prime}(a)}{a}+ \\frac{3}{2}\\frac{1-w(a)}{1+x(a)}\\frac{g(a)}{a^2}=0\\ , , \\label{ggrowth}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is defined as @xmath45    the linear mass power spectrum is proportional to @xmath46 and we define the deviation from the standard @xmath2cdm model by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the density fluctuation in the standard @xmath2cdm model . since @xmath46 derived from gd data differs from @xmath48 derived from the cmb anisotropies by no more than 10 per cent , the maximum value of @xmath49 is @xmath29 .",
    "we apply the above description to the following models used to explain the recent acceleration of the universe , suggested in the literature : a phenomenological vacuum energy decay model ; two models in which gravity is modified , bwm and vmm ; and the sugra model .      in a previous paper ,",
    "we put limits on the rate of a possible decay of the vacuum energy ( i.e. , the decay of the cosmological constant ) into cdm from the observed agreement , to within @xmath0 , of the @xmath1 derived from the cmb and the galaxy survey data @xcite .",
    "let us consider the vacuum energy decay model described , in a flat universe , by a power law dependence @xmath50 where @xmath51 . from conservation of energy and eq.([mainl ] ) , we have @xmath52\\ , , \\,\\label{rhopeeb}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 .",
