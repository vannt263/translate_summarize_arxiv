    "nevertheless , when analyzed in the context of physically motivated accretion flow models , they have resulted in dramatic constraints upon the spin orientation and magnitude @xcite .",
    "however , the absence of phase information introduces fundamental degeneracies in the orientation of the modeled image , and systematic uncertainties in the image structure generally .",
    "the importance of visibility phase information has been appreciated since the beginning of radio interferometry . in the context of vlbi",
    ", it has only been widely possible since the introduction of `` closure phases '' , and the associated development of self - calibration techniques ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "antennas there are only @xmath7 independent closure phases , and thus @xmath8 additional phases must be supplied to produce the full compliment of phase information .",
    "frequently , these are obtained via self - calibration techniques , a combination of non - linear algorithms in which the unknown phases are chosen such that the resulting image satisfies various physical constraints ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a detailed summary of self - calibration techniques ) . ] specifically , if @xmath9 is the visibility phase on the baseline between stations @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the closure phase associated with three stations is @xmath12 even a handful of closure phases are diagnostic of the underlying image structure , e.g. , the closure phases of a point source or gaussian flux distribution ( including asymmetric cases ) are identically @xmath13 , while that of an annulus may be either @xmath13 or @xmath3 , depending upon the particular baselines considered .",
    "more general flux distributions produce non - vanishing closure phases , indicative of the symmetry of the image .",

    "here , motivated by previous efforts to model the @xmath14-vlbi visibilities using physically motivated accretion models for sgr a * , we compute the closure phases implied by the radiatively inefficient accretion flow models and @xmath14-vlbi visibility amplitude fits presented in @xcite . by doing so we address three immediate questions :    1 .",
    "is the new closure phase estimate consistent with the accretion flow models we have considered in particular and radiatively inefficient accretion flow models generally ? 2 .",
    "what is the strength of the constraint placed upon physically motivated accretion flow models and the estimates of black hole spin by the measured closure phase ?",
    "what are the strength of the constraints that will possible in the near future as the eht develops ?    in section [ sec :",
    "cafcp ] we briefly describe the accretion models and how we compute the closure phases . in section [ sec : cwmv ] we compare the predicted closure phases with the measured values . in section",
    "[ sec : cpft ] we predict the closure phases for the eht and compare these with the estimated uncertainties of the eht . finally , we summarize our conclusions in section [ sec : c ] .",
    "we model sgr a * s accretion flow as a radiatively inefficient accretion flow , the details of which may be found in @xcite , and references therein , and thus we only summarize the model here .    sgr a * transitions from an inverted , presumably optically thick spectrum to an optically thin spectrum near millimeter wavelengths .",
    "this implies that near 1.3 mm sgr a * is only becoming optically thin , and thus absorption in the surrounding medium is likely to be important .",
    "this transition does not occur isotropically , happening at longer wavelengths for gas that is receding and at shorter wavelengths for gas that is approaching .",
    "therefore , properly modeling the structure and relativistic radiative transfer is crucial to producing high fidelity images .    for concreteness , as in @xcite",
    ", we follow @xcite and employ a model in which the accretion flow has a keplerian velocity distribution , a population of thermal electrons with density and temperature @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively , and a toroidal magnetic field in approximate ( @xmath24 ) equipartition with the ions ( which are responsible for the majority of the pressure ) , i.e. , @xmath25 in all of these , @xmath26 is the schwarzschild radius , @xmath27 is the cylindrical radius and @xmath28 is the vertical coordinate . inside of the innermost - stable circular orbit ( isco ) we assume the gas is plunging upon ballistic trajectories . in principle",
    "the plunging gas can still radiate , though in practice it contributes little to the overall emission due to the large radial velocities it develops . in the case of the thermal quantities",
    "the radial structure was taken from @xcite , and the vertical structure was determined by assuming that the disk height is comparable to @xmath27 .",
    "note that all of the models we employ necessarily have the spin aligned with the orbital angular momentum of the accretion flow .",
    "for the regions that dominate the @xmath29 emission , this assumption is well justified due to disk precession and viscous torques , though it may be violated at large distances .",
    "thermal electrons alone are incapable of reproducing the nearly - flat spectrum of sgr a * below @xmath30 .",
    "thus it is necessary to also include a nonthermal component . as with the thermal components ,",
    "we adopt a self - similar model for a population of nonthermal electrons , @xmath31 with a power - law distribution corresponding to a spectral index of @xmath32 and cut off below lorentz factors of @xmath33 ( consistent with * ? ? ?",
    "the radial power - law index was chosen to reproduce the low frequency spectrum of sgr a * , and is insensitive to the black hole properties due to the distant location of the long - wavelength emission .",
    "the primary emission mechanism at the wavelengths of interest is synchrotron radiation , arising from both the thermal and nonthermal electrons .",
    "we model the emission from the thermal electrons using the emissivity described in @xcite , appropriately altered to account for relativistic effects ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since we perform polarized radiative transfer via the entire complement of stokes parameters , we employ the polarization fraction for thermal synchrotron as derived in @xcite . in doing so",
    ", we have implicitly assumed that the emission due to thermal electrons is isotropic , which while generally not the case is unlikely to change our results significantly .",
    "for the nonthermal electrons , we follow @xcite for a power - law electron distribution , with an additional spectral break associated with the minimum electron lorentz factor . for both emission components the absorption coefficients are determined directly via kirchhoff s law .",
    "images are then produced using the fully relativistic ray - tracing and radiative transfer schemes described in @xcite and @xcite .    because @xcite neglected relativistic effects and assumed spherical symmetry , it is not directly applicable here .",
    "for these reasons , as in @xcite , the coefficients @xmath34 were adjusted to fit the radio spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of sgr a * ( see * ? ? ? * for details on the fitting procedure ) .",
    "we repeated this procedure for a large number of positions in the dimensionless spin - inclination ( @xmath35-@xmath36 ) parameter space , with @xmath37 corresponding to a maximally rotating kerr spacetime .",
    "we define @xmath36 such that models with @xmath38 are viewed along the spin axis , and thus the thick accretion disk viewed face - on .",
    "conversely , models with @xmath39 are viewed perpendicular to the spin axis , and thus the thick accretion disk is viewed edge - on . ] , producing a tabulated set of the coefficients @xmath34 at a large number of points throughout the @xmath35-@xmath36 parameter space . in all cases it was possible to fit the sed with extraordinary precision . from the tabulated values , the coefficients",
    "are then obtained at arbitrary @xmath35 and @xmath36 using high - order polynomial interpolation .    during the @xmath1-vlbi observations",
    "sgr a * s flux varied by roughly @xmath40 .",
    "we model this as a variable accretion rate , moving the electron density normalization up and down . in practice",
    ", we reduced the electron density normalization by an amount sufficient to produce a total flux of @xmath41 , and then multiplied the resulting images by a correction faction during the mm - vlbi data analysis . because the source is not uniformly optically thin ,",
    "this is not strictly correct , though this makes a small change to the images themselves .",
    "we produced 9090 images , with flux normalized as described above , at @xmath42 for each @xmath43 .",
    "we then produce models with arbitrary position angles , @xmath44 , by rotating the images on the sky . for this purpose",
    "we define @xmath44 as the position angle ( east of north ) of the projected spin vector .",
    "the intrinsic complex visibilities are obtained in the standard fashion : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the intensity at a given set of angular coordinates .",

    "here we consider two forms of @xmath50 : an isotropically distributed spin direction with a flat prior upon the spin magnitude , the same prior as that adopted in @xcite , and the posterior probability of a given spin , defined in @xcite , after fitting the @xmath1-vlbi amplitudes . we will refer to these as the `` isotropic '' and `` amplitude - fitted '' priors , respectively .",
    "interpolation errors associated with the finite density of points in the spin parameter space and the finite size of the imaged region , resulted in some small - amplitude saw - tooth features in the @xmath51 .",

    "all closure phase estimates we present are unique only up to a sign .",

    "it is immediately apparent that small closure phases are not generic . assuming the isotropic prior",
    ", fewer than 49% of the accretion flow models are consistent with the closure phase measurement .",
    "the inset in figure [ fig : day96cps ] bears this out ; while small closure phases are marginally preferred , a large closure phase island exists with a substantial likelihood of any phase being measured .",
    "the excluded models are not confined to a particular region in the spin parameter space , extending over a wide range of spin magnitudes , inclinations and position angles .",
    "thus , despite the large uncertainties , the measured closure phase has considerable diagnostic ability .    however , this changes dramatically when we restrict our attention to those models which are consistent with the @xmath1-vlbi amplitudes .",

    "the regions of high probability are confined to a narrow valley of low closure phases .",
    "hence , while accretion models generally are not necessarily consistent with the observed closure phases , the vast majority of those that were found to reproduce the visibility amplitudes _ are _ broadly consistent with the recent measurement . once the amplitude - fitted prior is adopted , the probability of finding a closure phase that is larger than @xmath82 falls to less than 3% .",
    "the amplitude - fitted models that violate the recent closure phase measurement are confined to the @xmath58@xmath57 significance regions , primarily at large spin magnitude and large negative position angles , where the closure phase is @xmath83 .",
    "this behavior is similar to that exhibited by annular models , in which the closure phase varies between @xmath13 and @xmath3 , depending upon the angular size of the annulus . as a result , improvements of factors of a few in sensitivity will allow closure phase measurements that can compete with the visibility amplitudes in their power to constrain the structure of sgr a*.    these conclusions",
    "are borne out by the closure phase probability distributions shown in figure [ fig : day96cps ] , computed with the amplitude - fitted prior .",
    "for these we show both times , which exhibit slightly different distributions , though in both cases the closure phases are dominated by peaks near @xmath84 and @xmath85 . the probability of measuring a closure phase within the allowed range exceeds 97% at both times .",
    "the closure phase of the model with the highest amplitude - fitted prior probability ( based upon the @xmath14-vlbi visibility amplitude ) is located at @xmath86",
    ". however , significant probabilities extend out to @xmath87 , and thus factor of few improvements in sensitivity necessarily result in a significant likelihood of detecting non - trivial closure phases .",
    "the development of the eht will be characterized by the inclusion of additional baselines and improvements in station sensitivity .",
    "thus , we also compute the closure phases along triangles including intermediate and large north - south baselines .",
    "figure [ fig : allcps ] show the probability distribution for closure phases on all triangles made with the smt , carma , hawaii , the lmt , and chile , as seen at 12:20 utc on day 96 of 2009 .",
    "closure phase distributions on other days and times are qualitatively similar . while the closure phase on the smt - carma - hawaii triangle is small , this is not generic .",
    "closure phases with magnitudes of @xmath88 are likely on five of ten triangles , including the smt - hawaii - chile and hawaii - chile - lmt triangles , for which the most probable model has closure phases comparable to @xmath89 ( shown by the red vertical lines in each panel)-@xmath57 region .",
    "this is not unexpected given the definition of the @xmath56-@xmath57 and @xmath58-@xmath57 regions , and does not indicate that the model with the highest posterior probability is inherently unlikely .",
    "these deviations are generally largest for large open triangles , associated with the intrinsically larger value and distribution of closure phases in these cases . ] .    more importantly , with improvements in the station sensitivity , arising from increases in bandwidth and the phasing together of multiple elements at individual stations , substantial improvements in the precision with which closure phases can be measured are possible .",
    "despite the small visibilities associated with the most probable model ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , on all baselines constructed from the five stations we consider , sgr a * is detectable on the typical atmospheric coherence time ( @xmath90 ) with snr exceeding unity . over the dynamical time",
    "scale of sgr a * , roughly @xmath91 , the uncertainty in the closure phase is reduced by an additional order of magnitude , resulting in the red , horizontal error bars in the individual panels of figure [ fig : allcps ] , ranging from @xmath92@xmath93 . in all cases",
    "this is much smaller than the presently allowed range of values , and provides sufficient precision to distinguish likely values from zero .",
    "the high precision with which closure phases may be measured in the near future , warrants a brief examination of their ability to help constrain the spin of sgr a*. to estimate this we consider the effects of including a single closure phase measurement on each of the various station - triangles discussed in section [ sec : cpft ] . in practice , where many closure phase measurements for each triangle are anticipated ,",
    "these are expected to be even more constraining .",
    "figure [ fig : cpspinlimits]a shows the posterior probability distribution obtained from analysing the 1.3mm - vlbi amplitudes alone , as a function of spin magnitude ( @xmath35 ) and inclination ( @xmath36 ) , after marginalized over the spin position angle ( @xmath44 ) due to this marginalization . ] . including the closure phase measurement reported in @xcite",

    "this allows us to compute the visibilities throughout the @xmath94-@xmath95 plane , obtain the snrs at each point , and thus infer both the expected closure phase , @xmath96 and the precision with which it may be measured , @xmath97 . based upon this",

    "we consider a handful of possible measurements that are relevant for upcoming observations .    improving the precision of the closure phase measurement on the smt - carma - jcmt triangle to @xmath101",
    "substantially improves the spin estimation in two respects .",
    "firstly , it would conclusively eliminate the @xmath3 degeneracy in the position angle resulting from fitting visibility amplitudes alone . secondly ,",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : cpspinlimits]c , it begins to significantly modify the 1-@xmath57 and 2-@xmath57 contours .",
    "thus , even with modest precisions , closure phase measurements can substantial improve black hole spin estimation in sgr a*.    for comparison with ongoing observations , we show in figure [ fig : cpspinlimits]d the constraints associated with closure phases measured with a phased hawaii , phased carma , smt , and apex , all with a @xmath102 bandwidth ( in contrast to the @xmath103 bandwidth assumed elsewhere ) . even without the substantial sensitivity improvements associated with large bandwidths and phasing up multiple alma antennas ,",
    "the resulting constraint is strengthened dramatically , in principle allowing a spin magnitude estimate with precision @xmath104 .",
    "the spin constraints associated with observations with a phased alma are shown in figure [ fig : cpspinlimits]e , at which point the allowed model parameter space becomes too small to resolve with the parameter sampling we employed .",
    "when the lmt is included ( figure [ fig : cpspinlimits]f ) , the allowed region is reduced to a single grid point in our model space ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 ) .",
    "whether such high precision spin estimation is possible in practice is almost certainly going to be limited by the systematic uncertainties in the modeling of the emission region .",
    "nevertheless , the constraining power of even a handful of closure phase measurements is clear .",
    "the measurement of mm - vlbi closure phases in sgr a * provide an independent , significant constraint upon the structure of the emission region .",
    "models based upon radiatively inefficient accretion flows do not generally have small closure phases , and thus are not generally consistent with the recently measured value on the smt - carma - jcmt triangle . as a consequence , even in the presence of large uncertainties",
    ", closure phases can place significant constraints upon the structure of sgr a*.    however , when only accretion flow models that fit the @xmath1-vlbi visibility amplitudes are considered , the probability of finding an excluded closure phase falls to less than 3% .",
    "hence , the vast majority of the acceptable models in @xcite are broadly consistent with all current @xmath1-vlbi constraints .",
    "this is surprising since the @xmath14-vlbi amplitudes and closure phase measurements provide independent constraints , and thus having fit the accretion models to the former there is no a priori reason to expect that they would be consistent with the latter .",
    "based upon the models that are consistent with the @xmath1-vlbi visibility amplitudes , we predict that the closure phase on the smt - carma - jcmt triangle during the time it was measured was between @xmath2 , with @xmath107 most preferred .",
    "improving the snr of mm - vlbi observations by a factor of a few , achievable by phasing up multiple carma antennas and employing the recently phased sites in hawaii , should allow detection of a non - zero closure phase on the smt - carma - jcmt triangle .",
    "note that this would eliminate the existing @xmath3 ambiguity in the orientation of sgr a*.    if sgr a * is well described by radiatively inefficient accretion flow models , currently acceptable closure phases on large triangles ( e.g. , smt - hawaii - chile and hawaii - chile - lmt ) can be as large as @xmath5 , and typical values on triangles which include long baselines of @xmath4 .",
    "future improvements in sensitivity associated with the near - term development of the eht will substantially increase the precision with which closure phases can be measured . on all triangles we considered ( constructed from the smt , carma , hawaii , the lmt , and chile ) the resulting precision should be sufficient to measure the deviations from @xmath13 .    improved closure phase measurements and baseline coverage result in dramatically improved constraints upon the spin of sgr a*. including a single antenna in chile ( e.g. , apex or a single alma dish ) produces spin estimates with precisions of roughly @xmath104 . with a partially phased alma station ,",
    "this improves to @xmath108 , and with the lmt is better than @xmath109 , at which point we fail to resolve the likely region . in the latter cases ,",
    "the spin estimation will almost certainly be limited by systematic uncertainties in the modeling of the emission region motivating the consideration of more sophisticated accretion and outflow models ."
