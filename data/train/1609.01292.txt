    "gravitational waves ( gws ) entered the limelight with the recent detection of gw150914 @xcite  soon followed by a second detection gw151226 @xcite  which not only constitutes the first observation of a black - hole ( bh ) binary system , but also marks a true milestone in gravitational physics .",
    "this breakthrough has opened a quantitatively new path for measuring bh parameters @xcite , testing einstein s theory of general relativity @xcite and probing extreme astrophysical objects and their formation history @xcite , and substantially broadens the scope of multi - messenger astronomy @xcite .",
    "gw modelling , however , finds important applications beyond the revolutionary field of gw astronomy . many fundamental questions in general relativity in @xmath3 and @xmath0 spacetime dimensions concern the stability of strong - gravity sources ( see @xcite and references therein ) in the context of cosmic censorship violation , the solutions significance as physical objects or expanding our understanding of the strong - field regime of general relativity .",
    "for instance , gw extraction from numerical simulations of rapidly spinning myers - perry bhs demonstrates how excess angular momentum is shed in order to allow the bh to settle down into a more slowly rotating configuration @xcite .",
    "gw emission also represents a channel for mass - energy loss in ultra - relativistic collisions that are studied in the context of the so - called tev gravity scenarios that may explain the hierarchy problem in physics ; for reviews see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of gw signals in the theoretical modelling of @xmath3 dimensional sources in the framework of general relativity has been increasingly well understood following seminal work by pirani , bondi , sachs and others in the 1950s and 1960s ; see e.g.  @xcite and @xcite for a review .",
    "applications are now routinely found in numerical and ( semi-)analytic calculations @xcite even though care needs to be taken when applied to numerical simulations on finite domains @xcite .",
    "the numerical study of solutions to einstein s equations has proven incredibly useful for understanding the behaviour of black holes and other compact objects .",
    "most recently , the application of numerical relativity in the generation of gravitational waveform templates for gw data analysis @xcite contributed to the above mentioned detection of gw150914 .",
    "the wave extraction techniques presently used in numerical simulations of astrophysical gw sources can be classified as follows : perturbative methods based on the formalism developed by regge , wheeler , zerilli and moncrief @xcite ; application of the quadrupole formula @xcite in matter simulations @xcite ; a method using the landau - lifshitz pseudo - tensor @xcite ; cauchy characteristic extraction @xcite ; and , probably the most popular technique , using the weyl scalars from the newman - penrose formalism @xcite . for a comparison of various of these techniques ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the calculation of gws in higher dimensional relativity requires generalization of these techniques to @xmath0 .",
    "the extraction of the gw energy flux from the landau - lifshitz pseudotensor has been generalized straightforwardly to higher dimensions in @xcite .",
    "an extension of the regge - wheeler - zerilli - moncrief formalism for perturbations of spherically symmetric background spacetimes is available in the form of the kodama and ishibashi ( ki ) formalism @xcite and forms the basis of the wave extraction techniques developed in @xcite .",
    "the main assumption there is that far away from the strong - field regime , the spacetime is perturbatively close to the tangherlini @xcite spacetime .",
    "the deviations from this background facilitate the construction of master functions according to the ki formalism which in turn provide the energy flux in the different @xmath4 radiation multipoles .",
    "even though both methods are in practice applied at finite extraction radius , their predictions have been found to agree within a @xmath5 error tolerance when applied to bh head - on collisions starting from rest in @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "recent years have also seen considerable progress in the understanding of the peeling properties of the weyl tensor ; see @xcite and references therein .    in particular , godazgar & reall @xcite",
    "have performed a decomposition of the weyl tensor in higher dimensions , and derived a generalisation of the newman - penrose formalism for wave extraction to @xmath0 .",
    "the numerical implementation of this formalism and probing the accuracy for a concrete example application is the subject of this paper .    for this purpose",
    ", we require a formulation of the higher dimensional einstein equations suitable for numerical integration . for computational practicality ,",
    "all higher dimensional time evolutions in numerical relativity have employed symmetry assumptions to reduce the problem to an effective `` @xmath7 + 1 '' dimensional computation where typically @xmath8 .",
    "this has been achieved in practice by either ( i ) imposing the symmetries directly on the metric line element @xcite , ( ii ) dimensional reduction by isometry of the einstein field equations @xcite or ( iii ) use of so - called _ cartoon _ methods @xcite . in our implementation",
    ", we use the latter method combined with the baumgarte - shapiro - shibata - nakamura @xcite ( bssn ) formulation of the einstein equations as expanded in detail in @xcite .",
    "the relevant expressions for the gw computation , however , will be expressed in terms of the arnowitt - deser - misner @xcite ( adm ) variables , and the formalism as presented here can be straightforwardly applied in other common evolution systems used in numerical relativity .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : notation ] we describe the notation used in the remainder of this work . in section [ sec : theory ] we recapitulate the key results of @xcite which sets up the formalism . in section [ sec : mc ] we put the formalism into a form compatible with the modified cartoon dimensional reduction of our simulations . in section [ sec : numerical ] we describe the numerical set up used in our simulations , analyse the energy radiated in bh collisions in @xmath1 and compare the predictions with literature results based on alternative wave extraction techniques .",
    "the key goal of our work is to extract the gw signal from dynamical , asymptotically flat @xmath9 dimensional spacetimes , i.e.  manifolds @xmath10 equipped with a metric @xmath11 , @xmath12 , of signature @xmath13 that obeys the einstein equations with vanishing cosmological constant @xmath14 here , @xmath15 is the energy momentum tensor which we assume to vanish in the wave zone , @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the ricci tensor and scalar , respectively , and we are using units where the gravitational constant and the speed of light @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , we define the riemann tensor and christoffel symbols according to the conventions of misner , thorne & wheeler @xcite .",
    "the adm space - time decomposition as reformulated by york @xcite writes the metric line element in the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 denote the lapse function and shift vector , respectively , and @xmath23 is the spatial metric that determines the geometry of hypersurfaces @xmath24 . for this choice of coordinates and variables , the einstein equations ( [ eq : einsteind ] ) result in one _ hamiltonian _ and @xmath25 _ momentum _ constraints as well as @xmath26 evolution equations cast into first - order - in - time form by introducing the extrinsic curvature @xmath27 through @xmath28 for a detailed review of this decomposition see @xcite .    in the remainder of this work",
    "we assume that the adm variables are available .",
    "the bssn formulation , for example , employs a conformally rescaled spatial metric @xmath29 , the rescaled traceless extrinsic curvature @xmath30 , a conformal factor @xmath31 , the trace of the extrinsic curvature @xmath32 and contracted christoffel symbols @xmath33 associated with the conformal metric .",
    "these are related to the adm variables by @xmath34    \\tilde{\\gamma}^{{{\\scriptscriptstyle{i } } } } = \\tilde{\\gamma}^{{{\\scriptscriptstyle{m}}}{{\\scriptscriptstyle{n } } } }    \\tilde{\\gamma}^{{{\\scriptscriptstyle{i}}}}_{{{\\scriptscriptstyle{m}}}{{\\scriptscriptstyle{n}}}}\\ , , &    \\label{eq : bssnvars}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the adm variables can be reconstructed straightforwardly at every time in the evolution . for other popular evolution systems such as the conformal z4 system @xcite or the generalized harmonic formulation @xcite the adm variables are obtained in similar fashion or directly from the spacetime metric components through eqs .",
    "( [ eq : admlineelement ] ) , ( [ eq : ek ] ) .    many practical applications of higher dimensional numerical relativity employ symmetry assumptions that reduce the computational domain to an effective three dimensional spatial grid using the aforementioned techniques .",
    "the reasons are two - fold : ( i ) the computational cost of simulations in @xmath35 dimensions massively increase with any dimension added and ( ii ) the @xmath36 rotational symmetry accomodates many applications of interest that can therefore be handled by relatively straightforward extensions of numerical codes originally developed for astrophysical systems in four spacetime dimensions .",
    "in general , the number of effective ( spatial ) dimensions can range inside @xmath37 , where @xmath38 corresponds to spherical symmetry , i.e.  @xmath39 isometry , and the other extreme @xmath40 corresponds to the axisymmetric case @xmath41 with rotational symmetry about one axis . as already detailed in @xcite , axisymmetry , i.e.  @xmath40 , represents a special case that imposes fewer constraints on the components of tensors and their derivatives and is therefore most conveniently handled numerically in a manner similar but not identical to the general case .",
    "we will discuss first in detail the case @xmath42 and then describe the specific recipe for dealing with @xmath40 .",
    "probably the most important situation encountered in practical applications is that of an effective @xmath43 dimensional spatial computational domain . whenever the expressions developed in the remainder of this work for general @xmath7 are not trivially obtained for the special choice @xmath43 , we shall therefore explicitly write down the @xmath43 version in addition to the general case .",
    "let us start by considering a spacetime with at least two rotational killing vectors which is the scenario discussed in secs .  2 and 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite . for convenience",
    ", we will employ two specific coordinate systems adapted to this situation .",
    "the first is a set of cartesian coordinates @xmath44 where middle latin indices without ( with ) a caret range from @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) , early latin indices run from @xmath47 , and rotational killing vector fields are presumed to exist in all planes spanned by any two of the coordinates @xmath48 .",

    "next , the components of the weyl tensor are projected onto the frame ( [ eq : tetrad ] ) and the leading order term in the radial coordinate is extracted . following @xcite , we denote this quantity by @xmath97 and its components are given by @xmath98 here @xmath99 denote a set of vectors forming an orthonormal basis for the unit metric @xmath90 on the @xmath13 sphere . in practice",

    "<S> gravitational waves are one of the most important diagnostic tools in the analysis of strong - gravity dynamics and have been turned into an observational channel with ligo s detection of gw150914 . aside from their importance in astrophysics , black holes and compact matter distributions have also assumed a central role in many other branches of physics . </S>",
    "<S> these applications often involve spacetimes with @xmath0 dimensions where the calculation of gravitational waves is more involved than in the four dimensional case , but has now become possible thanks to substantial progress in the theoretical study of general relativity in @xmath0 . here , we develop a numerical implementation of the formalism by godazgar & reall @xcite  based on projections of the weyl tensor analogous to the newman - penrose scalars  that allows for the calculation of gravitational waves in higher dimensional spacetimes with rotational symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we apply and test this method in black - hole head - on collisions from rest in @xmath1 spacetime dimensions and find that a fraction @xmath2 of the arnowitt - deser - misner mass is radiated away from the system , in excellent agreement with literature results based on the kodama - ishibashi perturbation technique . </S>",
    "<S> the method presented here complements the perturbative approach by automatically including contributions from all multipoles rather than computing the energy content of individual multipoles . </S>"
