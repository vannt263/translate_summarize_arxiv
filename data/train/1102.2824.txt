    "driven lattice gases represent perhaps the simplest models of interacting non - equilibrium systems that nevertheless display intriguingly complex features , and consequently have been carefully studied for many years now @xcite . since there exists to date no general theoretical framework to adequately capture and classify the macroscopic properties of non - equilibrium systems , simple paradigmatic models such as driven lattice gases have proven useful to gain a thorough understanding of at least certain models driven towards out - of - equilibrium stationary states , characterized by non - vanishing macroscopic ( probability , particle , or energy ) currents .",
    "let us briefly review the basic features of driven lattice gases with particle exclusion to provide a proper context for the present investigation . for",
    "the one - dimensional driven lattice gas with periodic boundary conditions , equal - time correlations have long been established to be trivial and governed by a simple product measure @xcite .",
    "its temporal evolution , in contrast , displays rich features , and is not easily accessible analytically .",
    "the bethe ansatz method was used to calculate the spectral gap at half filling which gives the value of the dynamic exponent @xcite .",
    "this approach was later generalized for arbitrary densities @xcite .",
    "the bethe ansatz also allows for calculation of conditional time - dependent probabilities for the lattice gas @xcite . yet time - dependent correlation functions have only been amenable to very limited general exact solutions most of which are tractable only for very small system sizes .",
    "the correlation functions are governed by non - trivial scaling laws even in the stationary state @xcite .",
    "it is well - understood that the large - scale behavior of the driven lattice gas in one dimension is governed in the coarse - grained continuum limit by the noisy burgers equation @xcite , and is also mappable to a surface growth model that belongs to the kpz universality class @xcite .",
    "the scaling form of the density - density correlation of the driven lattice gas has been derived and the associated scaling exponents calculated by means of renormalization group techniques @xcite .",
    "scaling functions have been computed by means of the mode - coupling approximation @xcite , exact numerical integration @xcite , and other analytical approaches @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we employ extensive large - scale monte carlo simulations to confirm the exactly known scaling exponents in one , two , and three dimensions .",
    "we will also compare our numerical data to different predictions for the scaling functions .",
    "in one dimension in particular , our monte carlo simulations yield a remarkably slow approach to the asymptotic scaling behavior , governed by an unusual form of the associated scaling function .",
    "non - stationary properties of the driven lattice gas in the physical aging regime are considerably less understood . for kpz surface growth",
    ", a renormalization group analysis demonstrated that the so - called initial slip exponent can be related to the dynamical exponent , and no additional singularities associated with the initial - time surface emerge @xcite .",
    "we find that similar scaling relations hold for driven lattice gases in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "in addition , for appropriate highly correlated initial conditions ( that in the growth model mapping correspond to a flat surface ) , we establish simple aging scaling in the non - stationary time regime @xcite .",
    "this is in accord with studies that showed simple aging as well for both the kpz surface growth model @xcite and its linear counterpart , the edwards ",
    "wilkinson model @xcite .",
    "a few exact results were found in the non - stationary regime , for small systems @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the following section",
    "we describe the models under investigation , comment on our monte carlo simulation specifics , define the relevant observables , and provide the dynamic scaling forms for the density - density ( and height - height ) correlation function . in section",
    "[ steady ] , we present our simulation results in the non - equilbrium steady state for the model , focusing on the behavior in one dimension .",
    "short time results for densities away from half filling yield charactaristic oscillations in the density - density correlation function .",
    "next finite - size scaling features are discussed in some detail .",
    "we generate the scaling functions from our simulation data and compare them to the accepted forms .",
    "the unusually slow relaxation of the local exponent of the density - density correlation function towards its asymptotic universal value is carefully investigated for the one - dimensional case , and contrasted with the much more straightforward behavior seen in higher dimensions .",
    "we conclude this section with a discussion of the effects of finite rather than infinite hopping bias .",
    "section  [ aging ] contains our simulation results for non - stationary properties of the driven lattice gas , starting from a correlated initial state , in one , two and three dimensions .",
    "we cast our results in the standard simple aging scaling form and compute the aging exponents by means of a simple scaling argument , which is _ a - posteriori _",
    "confirmed by our simulations .",
    "we study driven lattice gases with site exclusion on a @xmath0-dimensional square lattice of size @xmath1 with periodic boundary conditions , with a total number of @xmath2 particles @xcite .",
    "the exclusion constraint limits the site occupation number at a position @xmath3 on the lattice to the values @xmath4 .",
    "the particles may hop to nearest - neighbor lattice sites only if these are empty . in one dimension ,",
    "this model is referred to as the periodic asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) .",
    "we denote the probabilities of hopping `` forward '' and `` backward '' as @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . for @xmath7 ,",
    "no net particle current arises ; the system is then in equilibrium . for @xmath8 and",
    "hence @xmath9 , only unidirectional motion ( to the right ) is possible , and the model reduces to the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) .",
    "the generalization of the driven lattice gas model to higher dimensions @xmath0 is straightforward .",
    "after a single specific drive direction is selected , we define the hopping probabilities ( to empty sites ) along this direction to be @xmath10 and @xmath11 , while there is no hopping bias in the @xmath12 transverse dimensions , @xmath13 ( symmetric exclusion process , sep ) .    in one dimension , this lattice gas model can be mapped to a surface growth problem in the kpz universality class @xcite . to this end , one defines local ising spin variables @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the occupation number .",
    "the height variable at site @xmath3 is then given by the accumulated magnetization from the ( arbitrary ) reference point at site @xmath16 up to @xmath3 : @xmath17 particle exclusion restricts the local slope of the surface height profile to @xmath18 .",
    "this mapping allows us to directly relate observables such as correlation functions calculated for the surface growth model to those for our driven lattice gas model .",
    "we employ both standard metropolis and continuous - time monte carlo algorithms to study the driven lattice gas .",
    "the standard monte carlo algorithm @xcite starts with all particles placed at random positions .",
    "a particle is randomly selected , and then one of the @xmath19 directions for a potential nearest - neighbor hop is randomly chosen .",
    "a hop has a predetermined probability @xmath20 $ ] ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 is either @xmath10 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , or @xmath25 ) .",
    "a random number @xmath26 $ ] is picked ; if @xmath27 then hop @xmath28 is performed .",
    "particle exclusion is realized in this simulation by setting @xmath29 for any hop that attempts to move a particle into an occupied site .",
    "one monte carlo time step has passed once @xmath2 hopping attempts have been made .",
    "on average the algorithm thus attempts to hop each particle once per monte carlo time step . in dimensions",
    "@xmath30 , the hopping probabilities are asymmetric parallel to the drive ( if not mentioned otherwise we use @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) , and symmetric in the transverse directions @xmath33 . with the periodic boundary conditions , this prescription generates a ( fluctuating ) particle current along the drive direction .    for the one - dimensional system we employ the continuous - time monte carlo algorithm @xcite , which is initialized the same way as the standard monte carlo process .",
    "the crucial feature of this algorithm is that hops are never rejected ; they are simply performed at the correct rates .",
    "the probability for each possible hop @xmath28 from a given configuration @xmath34 of the system is @xmath22 .",
    "an active list is kept of all possible hops with @xmath35 , and the next hop is chosen by sampling the list .",
    "time is incremented by @xmath36 . for the driven lattice gas with exclusion",
    ", each site has an equal probability of being occupied , equal to the filling fraction or mean density @xmath37 ; e.g. , for a half - filled system the probability is @xmath38 .",
    "this algorithm eliminates all attempted hops that would be rejected due to exclusion .",
    "this is realized in the simulation as follows for the asep .",
    "two lists are maintained , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , one for the hops to the right and left with probabilities @xmath5 and @xmath41 , normalized by @xmath42 .",
    "a random number @xmath26 $ ] is generated .",
    "if @xmath43 , a hop to the right is performed , if @xmath44 we chose a hop to the left .",
    "note that we may only proceed in this manner because the list lengths @xmath45 of possible left and right hops are equal .",
    "a random integer @xmath46 $ ] is selected , and we correspondingly update the @xmath47th particle in the @xmath39 or @xmath40 list . the time counter is increased by @xmath48 which is calculated using the rates prior to the hop being performed .",
    "this continuous - time algorithm yields an efficiency enhancement of approximately a factor of @xmath49 , because only hops which can be performed are chosen , and consequently allows us to increase the effective simulation time by that factor also .",
    "we note that in the following , all distances and times will be measured in units of the lattice spacing and monte carlo steps ( mcs ) , respectively .",
    "our starting point is the two - time density - density ( connected ) correlation function ( cumulant ) , defined as @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes an ensemble average over ( many ) stochastic realizations . in the stationary state ,",
    "a periodic system becomes translationally invariant in both space and time .",
    "therefore the correlation function depends only on coordinate and time differences . defining the average density @xmath52",
    ", we then obtain @xmath53    for the driven lattice gas ( asep ) in the stationary state , it is well known that each possible particle configuration @xmath34 occurs with equal probability @xmath54 , namely the inverse of the number @xmath55 of possible states @xmath56 this independent - particle result remarkably remains valid even in the presence of on - site particle exclusion @xcite .",
    "however , if nearest - neighbor interactions were added , the stationary probabilities would depend on the particles relative positions .",
    "> from the simple product measure ( [ probc ] ) , we can readily obtain the equal - time stationary density - density correlation function @xmath57 .",
    "the probability to find a particle at a given site @xmath58 is just the average density @xmath59 , and given that site @xmath58 is occupied the density at a different site @xmath60 is @xmath61 , which yields @xmath62 .",
    "the sum now extends over configurations @xmath63 , which encompass all possible states of @xmath64 particles in the remaining @xmath65 sites , whose stationary probability @xmath66 is again given by eq .",
    "( [ probc ] ) .",
    "but the summation gives us a multiplicative factor @xmath67 , which is the number of possible configurations of the remaining @xmath64 particles placed in the remaining @xmath65 sites .",
    "hence we arrive at the simple result @xmath68 , and the equal - time correlation function becomes @xmath69 taking the thermodynamic limit @xmath70 while keeping @xmath59 constant , the correlation function ( [ etcorr ] ) vanishes for @xmath71 .",
    "however , in a finite system , eq .",
    "( [ etcorr ] ) yields a negative value @xmath72 reflecting the particle anti - correlations induced by site exclusion .",
    "a more interesting quantity to study is the two - time ( connected ) auto - correlation function @xmath73 , which in the stationary state can be written as @xmath74 .    in a finite one - dimensional system with periodic boundary conditions , i.e. , a ring with @xmath75 sites , another notable quantity is the velocity of a single `` tagged '' particle @xcite @xmath76 we have checked and confirmed this tagged particle velocity in our monte carlo simulations .",
    "note that @xmath77 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "since our numerical data are obtained in finite systems , the typical return time @xmath78 for a specific particle to traverse the entire ring and come back to its original site posits an upper limit to the argument @xmath79 for a meaningful analysis of the time - dependent auto - correlation function @xmath80 .",
    "we remark that the tagged particle velocity has to be carefully distinguished from the propagation speed of a collective density fluctuation @xcite @xmath81 which vanishes only at half - filling @xmath38 .      in the scaling limit ,",
    "the steady - state density - density correlations for the driven lattice gas with exclusion in @xmath0 dimensions are described by a general homogeneous function of the following form @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 represents an arbitrary real scale factor , and the subscripts @xmath84 and @xmath85 denote transverse and parallel directions with respect to the drive .",
    "the exponents @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the anisotropy and ( transverse ) dynamical exponents , respectively .",

    "the transverse spatial directions become obsolete , and with the exact renormalization group result @xmath102 we obtain @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
