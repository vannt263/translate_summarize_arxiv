    "trilayer graphene as a novel material has attracted considerable attention in recent years@xcite .",
    "trilayer and few layer graphene are interesting because they possess different and unique properties with respect to both single layer graphene and conventional semiconductors .",
    "for instance , bilayer@xcite and certain types of trilayer graphene@xcite are shown to have an electrically tunable band gap@xcite .",
    "this would make them good candidates for application in electronic industry where the control of the band gap is desirable to implement a chosen logic . on the other hand , plasma excitations in graphene structures@xcite and in general nanostructures made of graphene , semiconductors and/or metals are the subject of current interest of many researchers worldwide .",
    "the new emerging field called plasmonics@xcite and nanoplasmonics is concerned with the methods to confine plasmons and electromagnetic fields over dimensions on the order of or smaller than its wavelength .",
    "for instance , surface plasmons guided by graphene structures are shown to exhibit low losses and being tunable by gating and doping makes graphene an appropriate candidate to replace metal plasmonic devices@xcite .    in order to investigate the electron - plasmon interaction in more detail , the concept of a new quasiparticle named `` plasmaron ''",
    "was introduced which is in fact a bound state of a charge carrier with plasmons .",
    "coulomb interaction and plasmarons in both single layer graphene@xcite and bilayer graphene@xcite have been studied intensively .",
    "one of the reasons is that it was found experimentally that , in monolayer graphene@xcite the accepted view of a linear ( dirac - like ) spectrum does not provide a sufficiently detailed picture of the charge carrying excitations in this material .",
    "the motivation behind the interest in this kind of studies is that studying the physics of the interaction between electrons and plasmons may lead to the realization of plasmonic devices which merge photonics and electronics .",
    "the interest in similar phenomena in few layer graphene is equally high .",
    "coulomb interaction and electronic screening was probed in bilayer and multilayer graphene using angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) in ref .  .",
    "further plasmon dispersion was studied in multilayer graphene using high - resolution electron energy - loss spectroscopy in ref .  .",
    "recently , plasmarons and the quantum spectral function in bilayer graphene was investigated in ref .   theoretically , where the onset of a broad plasmaron peak away from the fermi surface was predicted .",
    "while the energy dispersion in graphene is linear in momentum , in trilayer graphene it can be cubic , hyperbolic and/or linear depending on the stacking order .",
    "the advantage of multilayer graphene over usual semiconductors is that its charge carrier density can be controlled by the application of a gate voltage over orders of magnitude and the charge carrier type can be changed from electrons to holes .",
    "furthermore , the band gap can be tuned to meet specific demands for device design .    in this work ,",
    "we use second order perturbation theory in order to take into account the electron - plasmon interaction which is cast into a field theoretical problem . in this way , one is able to calculate the correction to the band structure which comes as a consequence of the interaction of charge carriers with plasmons .",
    "the interaction is treated using the overhauser approach@xcite here applied to the two - dimensional electron gas in trilayer graphene .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ theory ] we present the theoretical model and derive the relevant expressions for the interaction and the coupling between electrons and plasmons in trilayer graphene . in the subsequent section , sec .  [ results ] ,",
    "the numerical calculations of the energy correction due to the interaction with plasmons are presented as a function of electron momentum and for various doping levels , i.e. charge carrier density . both stacking order _",
    "abc _ and _ aba _ were considered .",
    "the influence of the doping level is analyzed and discussed .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and present the conclusions in sec .",

    "if the relevant energies of interest in trilayer graphene are smaller than the interlayer hopping parameter @xmath4 , one may use the low energy limit . in this limit",
    ", the problem can be reduced to the effective two - band model and the corresponding hamiltonian reads@xcite @xmath5\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the fermi velocity .",
    "the eigenvalues of eq .",
    "( [ ham0 ] ) are known and read @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "structures made of graphene may exhibit and support quanta of collective charge excitations of the electron gas , i.e. plasmons , as a result of the restoring force of the long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "contrary to the case of conventional two - dimensional electron gas , the `` dirac plasma '' is manifestly of quantum nature@xcite .",
    "for example , in single layer graphene the plasma frequency is proportional to @xmath9 , and does not have a classical limit independent of the planck constant .",
    "the dynamic dielectric function within random phase approximation ( rpa ) is given by    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the dielectric constant of the material and is related to the one of the substrate .",
    "here @xmath12 is the free - particle polarizability and is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the degeneracy factor , @xmath15 is the fermi - dirac distribution , and @xmath16 is the volume of the system . here @xmath17 is the overlap between the states having momentums @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in the long wavelength limit @xmath20",
    "( i.e. @xmath21 ) one may expand the denominator@xcite and then keep the first term of the taylor series for both the difference in the fermi functions and the energies ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "further , the overlap integral @xmath17 is close to unity since the angle between @xmath18 and @xmath19 is almost zero .",
    "finally for the zero temperature case , the difference of the fermi functions will yield the factor @xmath23 .",
    "this leads to an approximate relation for the polarizability @xmath24 taking into account the energy - momentum relation , eq .",
    "( [ eigenener ] ) and upon inserting eq .",
    "( [ piapprox ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ dielpi ] ) one arrives at the plasmon dispersion relation @xmath25 the fermi wavevector can be calculated from the known relation @xmath26 which holds for all @xmath27d systems with isotropic energy dispersion .",
    "the excitations of the electron gas can be represented by a scalar field previously described by overhauser@xcite for the @xmath28d electron gas , but here modified for the @xmath27d electron gas .",
    "the correction to the electron spectrum are calculated in a similar way as for the polaron problem with the difference that a test charge interacts with plasmons .",
    "the interaction of an electron with plasmons was treated in our earlier work@xcite , and the interaction term of the hamiltonian is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are electron annihilation and creation operators , respectively . here",
    "the electron - plasmon interaction matrix element is@xcite @xmath32 the value of @xmath33 is determined using the @xmath34-sum rule applied to the case of interest .",
    "the derivation of the @xmath34-sum rule goes as follows .",

    "@xmath36 is the electron density operator , @xmath37    then , it is known that the relation @xmath38 holds for any commutator with the hamiltonian , @xmath39 $ ] .",

    "( [ nq ] ) , the sum rule reduces to @xmath45 here the quantity @xmath46 serves as a small dimensionless parameter in the electron - plasmon interaction , and takes the value of about or less than @xmath47 . on inserting eq .",
    "( [ vq4 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ vq1 ] ) one arrives at the following expression for the interaction matrix element @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the electron concentration .",
    "note that @xmath50 is not the bare plasmon frequency but is modified by the polarization of the electron gas . in order to investigate electron - plasmon interaction ,",
    "one should consider a test charge interacting with the plasmon modes .",
    "but this test charge introduces a change in energy as a result of its interaction with the dielectric . in order to determine",
    "the value of the plasmon frequency one needs the electron dielectric function .",
    "it can be shown that the static dielectric function within the random phase approximation can be approximated by the following relation@xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the screening wavevector@xcite and given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the density of states of the _ abc _ stacked trilayer graphene , @xmath55    here @xmath14 is the degeneracy factor that takes into account both spin and valley degrees of freedom .",
    "then , the actual plasmon frequency is given by@xcite @xmath56    now , using second order perturbation theory , the correction to the energy spectrum is given by    @xmath57    where @xmath58 stands for the principal value . here , the cut - off value for the momentum @xmath43 was taken to be @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the lattice constant .",
    "this formula correspond to non - degenerate rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory ( rspt ) . for certain values of the plasmon wavevector @xmath43",
    "a degeneracy occurs when @xmath61 , and one should employ improved wigner brillouin perturbation theory@xcite ( iwbpt ) .",
    "the main idea behind this method is to ensure enhanced convergence when the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ corre ] ) approaches zero , which is realized by adding the term @xmath62 ( @xmath63 is evaluated within rspt ) ,    @xmath64    this equation has to be solved self - consistently as @xmath65 appears on both sides of the equation .",
    "because of the isotropic nature of the spectrum , we have @xmath66 . in the next section the value of @xmath67 ( within iwbpt ) will be calculated numerically for concrete values of the doping level , permittivity and other material parameters .",
    "as has been pointed out elsewhere@xcite the plasmon excitation in graphene of the dirac sea remains pretty much well defined even when it penetrates the interband particle - hole continuum .",
    "this is the consequence of the fact that the transitions near the bottom of the interband particle - hole continuum have almost parallel wavevectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "thus , those transitions carry negligible charge - fluctuation weight .",
    "a similar conclusion holds for trilayer graphene . in practice ,",
    "the damping can be important for very large momentum @xmath68 , but then the contribution to the energy shift , i.e. to the integral in eq .",
    "( [ correiw ] ) , is small .      in this case",
    "multilayer graphene is stacked in the bernal type where the sites in the first and the third layer coincide .",
    "this kind of stacking is more common and can be realized by exfoliating natural graphite because it has virtually the same crystalline structure@xcite .",

    "the hamiltonian is written in the basis of orbital eigenfunctions @xmath73^{t}\\,,\\ ] ] where the indices correspond to the different sublattices ( _ a _ or _ b _ ) of the three layers .",
    "when the external potential is zero , @xmath74 , the two blocks in the hamiltonian correspond to a superimposed linear spectrum ( monolayer like ) and a hyperbolic one ( bilayer like ) near the dirac point .",
    "then , electrons in _ aba _ stacked tlg may propagate through two different modes , one monolayer - like and the other bilayer - like mode .",
    "the scattering between the two modes is not allowed as long as the mirror symmetry of the three layers remains conserved . as for the plasmons in trilayer graphene",
    ", one can envisage that the system in question is composed of monolayer and bilayer graphene and the dielectric function can then be written in the @xmath71 matrix form @xmath75 where @xmath76 here @xmath77 is the interlayer distance @xmath78 , while @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the polarizability of single and bilayer graphene , respectively . here",
    "we assume that to leading order there is no direct coupling between the two modes so that @xmath81 .",
    "upon inserting @xmath82 for single layer and @xmath83 for bilayer in eq .",
    "( [ dielmatr ] ) one can find the plasmon modes by determining the zeros of the dielectric function @xmath84 . here",

    "as can be seen , the shift increases with the electron momentum , and this dependence is more pronounced for lower electron concentrations .",
    "the increase with @xmath18 is more rapid than in the case of single layer graphene@xcite .",
