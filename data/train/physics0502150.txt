    "for more than two decades , there has been considerable interest in the investigation of the scaling behaviour on fractal models .",
    "the pioneering work @xcite on fractals introduced the concept of fractals and showed some relation between self - similar fractals and self - affine fractals .",
    "self - affine fractals @xcite constitute random and complicated structure and have been applied to a broader range of problems , such as the eden and ballistic deposition model @xcite , mountain heights , clouds , coast lines , and cracks . among other examples of many fractal models , the self - avoiding random",
    "walk , random resistor , polymer bonds , turbulences , chaotic motions can be mentioned @xcite , _",
    "etc_. specially , the real data from different financial markets show apparent multifractal properties @xcite .",
    "moreover , recently , financial analysis of foreign exchanges has became one of the outstanding topics in econophysics @xcite .",
    "many of these researches apply multifractal analysis framework as a basic framework . in universal multifractal framework ,",
    "the statistics of the data are fully described with some parameters , taking into account two complementary aspects of financial time series : the multiple scaling and the pareto probability distributions , which is a generic feature of multifractal processes @xcite .",
    "+ it has been shown that there are two main factors leading to multifractal behaviour of financial time series , nonlinear time correlations between present and past events and the heavy - tailed probability distributions of functions .",
    "based on ref .",
    "@xcite , for the stocks , the main contribution to multifractality comes from a broad distribution of returns while a long memory present in this kind of data contributes only marginally .",
    "it should be noted that the nature of correlations leading to the multifractal dynamics of the variations is strongly nonlinear and , curiously , can not be simply related to some well - known correlation type like a slowly decreasing volatility autocorrelation with an imposed daily pattern .",
    "for example , one even has to consider the nonlinear dependencies in the volatility itself in order to reveal how the temporal correlations contribute to multifractality in the stock market and foreign exchange data .",
    "+ in this paper , the rial - dollar exchange rate data is studied with the focus on their fractal properties .",
    "the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis is applied which is a well - established method of detecting scaling behaviour of time series . in section 1 ,",
    "theoretical backgrounds including mfdfa method , sources of multifractality , multifractality finger prints and strength of multifractality are reviewed .",
    "data are described in section 2 .",
    "numerical results are presented in section 3 and finally , conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) is a scaling analysis technique providing a simple quantitative parameter - the scaling exponent @xmath0-to represent the correlation properties of a time series @xcite .",
    "the advantage of dfa over many techniques are that it permits the detection of long - range correlations embedded in seemingly non - stationary time series , and also avoids the spurious detection of apparent long - range correlations that are an artifact of non - stationarity .",
    "additionally , the advantages of dfa in computation of @xmath1 over other techniques ( for example , the fourier transform ) are : +    * inherent trends are avoided at all time scales ; * local correlations can be easily probed .    to implement the dfa , let us suppose there is a time series , @xmath2 .",
    "the time series @xmath3 is integrated : @xmath4\\ ] ] where : @xmath5 next @xmath3 is broken up into @xmath6 non - overlapping time intervals , @xmath7 , of equal size @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath6 corresponds to the integer part of @xmath10 . in each box ,",
    "the integrated time series is fitted by using a polynomial function , @xmath11 , which is called the local trend . for order-_l _ dfa ( dfa-1 if @xmath12=1 , dfa-2 if @xmath12=2 , etc . ) , the _ l_-order polynomial function should be applied for the fitting .",
    "the integrated time series @xmath13 is detrended in each box , and calculated the detrended fluctuation function : @xmath14 for a given box size @xmath15 , the root mean square fluctuation is calculated : @xmath16^{2}}\\ ] ] the above computation is repeated for box sizes @xmath15 ( different scales ) to provide a relationship between @xmath17 and @xmath15 .",
    "a power law relation between @xmath17 and @xmath15 indicates the presence of scaling : @xmath18 .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 , called the scaling exponent or correlation exponent , represents the correlation properties of the signal : if @xmath19 , there is no correlation and the signal is an uncorrelated signal @xcite ; if @xmath20 , the signal is anticorrelated ; if @xmath21 , there are positive correlations in the signal . in the two latest cases ,",
    "the signal can be well approximated by the fractional brownian motion law @xcite .",
    "+ for a further characterization of data it is meaningful to extend eq .",
    "( 15 ) by considering the more general fluctuation functions @xcite .",
    "simply , it is achieved by averaging over all boxes to obtain the @xmath22th order fluctuation function @xmath23^{1/q},\\ ] ]    where , in general , the index variable @xmath22 can take any real values except zero .",
    "if the analyzed signal develops fractal properties , the fluctuation function reveals power - law scaling @xmath24 for large @xmath15 .",
    "the scaling exponents @xmath25 can be then obtained by observing the slope of log - log plots of @xmath26 vs.@xmath15 .",
    "the family of the exponents @xmath25 describe the scaling of the @xmath22th order fluctuation function . for positive values of @xmath22 ,",
    "@xmath25 exponents describe the scaling behaviour of boxes with large fluctuations while those of negative values of @xmath22 , describe scaling behaviour of boxes with small fluctuations @xcite . for stationary time",
    "series , the exponent @xmath27 is identical to the hurst exponent .",
    "thus the exponents @xmath25 are called as the generalized hurst exponents @xcite . for monofractal time series which are characterized by a single exponent over all scales",
    ", @xmath25 is independent of @xmath22 , whereas for a multifractal time series , @xmath25 varies with @xmath22 .",
    "this dependence is considered to be a characteristic property of multifractal processes @xcite .",
    "the @xmath25 obtained from mf - dfa is related to the renyi exponent @xmath28 by @xmath29 therefore , another way to characterize a multifractal series is the singularity spectrum @xmath30 defined by @xcite @xmath31 + 1,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 stands for the derivative of @xmath25 with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath0 is the h@xmath33lder exponent or singularity strength which characterizes the singularities in a time series .",
    "the singularity spectrum @xmath30 describes the singularity content of the time series .",
    "finally , it must be noted that @xmath25 is different from the generalized multifractal dimensions @xmath34 that are used instead of @xmath28 in some papers . while @xmath25 is independent of @xmath22 for a monofractal time series with compact support , @xmath35 depends on @xmath22 in that case .      generally , there are two different types of sources for multifractality in time series : ( i ) due to different long - range temporal correlations for small and large fluctuations , and ( ii ) due to fat - tailed probability distributions of variations .",
    "both of them need a multitude of scaling exponents for small and large fluctuations .",
    "two procedure is followed to find the contributions of two sources of multifractality and to indicate the multifractality strength : ( i ) shuffling , and ( ii ) phase randomization .",
    "shuffling procedure preserves the distribution of the variations but destroys any temporal correlations .",
    "in fact , one can destroy the temporal correlations by randomly shuffling the corresponding time series of variations .",
    "what then remains are data with exactly the same fluctuation distributions but without memory.the shuffling procedure consists of the following steps    * generate pairs @xmath36 of random integer numbers ( with @xmath37 ) where @xmath38 is the total length of the time series to be shuffled . * swap entries @xmath39 and @xmath22 .",
    "* repeat two above steps for @xmath40 times .",
    "( this step ensures that ordering of entries in the time series is fully shuffled . )    in order to study the contribution of the fat - tailed variations on the multifractality , the surrogate data are used .",
    "in fact , the non - gaussianity of the distributions can be weakened by creating the phase - randomized surrogates @xcite .",
    "the phase randomization steps are :    * take discrete fourier transform of time series . + * multiply the discrete fourier transform of the data by random phases .",
    "+ * perform an inverse fourier transform to create a phase randomized surrogates .",
    "phase randomization preserves the amplitudes of the fourier transform but randomizing the fourier phases .",
    "this procedure eliminates nonlinearities , preserving only the linear properties of the original time series @xcite .",
    "one can see that in the whole q - range the generalized hurst exponents @xmath25 can be fitted well by the formula @xmath41}{qln2}\\ ] ] which corresponds to @xmath42/ln2 $ ] .",
    "this formula can be obtained from a generalized binomial multifractal model @xcite . instead of choosing @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the hurst exponent @xmath45 and the persistence exponent @xmath27 could be chosen . from knowledge of two moments ,",
    "all the other momemts follow . here",
    "the formula is used only to show that the infinite number of exponents @xmath25 can be described by only two independent parameters , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "these two parameters can then be regarded as multifractal finger prints for a considered time series .      in the generalized binomial multifractal model",
    ", the strength of the multifractality of a time series can be characterized by the difference between the maximum and minimum values of @xmath0 , @xmath46 .",
    "when @xmath47 approaches zero for @xmath22 approaching @xmath48 , then @xmath49 is simply given by @xmath50 it must be noted that this parameter is identical to the width of the singularity spectrum @xmath30 at @xmath51 . the wider singularity spectrum the richer multifractality .",
    "the data which is analyzed are the time series of the daily closing exchange rate logarithmic variations ( that is , ln(p(t))/ ln(p(t+1 ) ) for the time period 24th september 1989 , to 15th november 2003 . so that our database consists of 4369 exchange rates and 4368 daily variations .",
    "the sources of this data is the central bank of the islamic republic of iran . in fig .",
    "1 a time series corresponding to daily values of the iranian rial - us dollar exchange rates in mentioned period is presented . a great increment in dollar price",
    "is seen about 16th may 1995 because of iranian government decision on lifting the ban on foreign exchanges price variations .",
    "the iranian government has managed to keep the exchange rate stable at around 8000 rials per us dollar ever since march 2000 .",
    "also , table 1 provides summary statistics of logarithmic variations of exchange rates .",
    ".[tb2]mean , standard deviation , skewness , and kurtosis of rial - dollar exchange rate variations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is seen that the strength of multifractality in rial - dollar exchange rate variations is very powerful .",
    "moreover , multifractalty strength in randomized data decreases specially in surrogate data based on values in table 2 . + in order to visualizing and better understanding the strength of multifractality for original , reshuffled and surrogate data , the singularity spectrum of series are shown in fig .",
    "both the widths of the @xmath30 spectra in each randomized data are much smaller than for the original one .",
    "this behaviour of the reshuffled time series confirms that the persistent autocorrelations play an important role in multiscaling of the price variations .",
    "but , the spectra for the surrogates are typically much narrower than for the reshuffled data which can be interpreted as an evidence of the influence of extremely large non - gaussian events on the fractal properties of the time series .",
    "the multifractal properties of the iranian rial - us dollar exchange rate logarithmic variations has been studied in this paper through multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis .",
    "it is shown that the time series for exchange rate variations exhibit the characteristics that can be interpreted in terms of multifractality . its degree expressed by e.g.",
    "the widths of the singularity spectra @xmath30 indicate a strong multifractality . moreover",
    ", although the most multifractality of the exchange rate variations data is due to different long - range correlations for small and large fluctuations , the shape of the probability distribution function also contributes to the multifractal behaviour of the time series ."
