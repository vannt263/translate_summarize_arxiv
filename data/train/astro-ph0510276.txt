    "recent mid - infrared interferometric observations @xcite were able to resolve the inner dust torus of the nearby ( 14.4 mpc ; @xcite ) seyfert 2 galaxy ngc1068 .",
    "the emission distribution along this torus showed a small hot source ( probably the accretion disk ) , surrounded by a parsec - scale warm dust structure .",
    "the hot source coincides with the bright h@xmath0o masers ( @xcite ) detected with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) .",
    "the maser emission seems to originate in a sub - keplerian rotating disk with inner and outer radius corresponding to @xmath10.65 and 1.1 pc respectively enclosing , within its inner radius , a black hole and an accretion disk of @xmath1 10@xmath2 m@xmath3 .",
    "the departure from keplerian motion has been attributed to the high mass of the accretion disk that dilutes the gravitational field of the black hole ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the continuum emission at sub - arcsecond scales revealed four components arranged in a jet - counterjet structure , with the core coinciding with the accretion disk position ( @xcite ) .",
    "the radio jet orientation changes monotonically with its distance from the core , bending towards the northeast direction . at larger scales , extended lobes",
    "are observed , with the northeast lobe having a conic shape , similar to the bow shock structure produced by jet - environment interaction @xcite .",
    "an interesting result from maser observations is that the maser disk is not completely aligned with the major axis of the accretion disk across all its extension ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , they reveal a maser distribution similar to a warped disk , with the inner parts almost perpendicular to the jet , but deviating from this configuration as the distance to the core increases .",
    "@xcite proposed a configuration in which the thin hot disk is perpendicular to the radio jet , while the misaligned maser disk points towards the parsec - scale dusty - torus .    in this work",
    "we investigate the possibility that both the bent jet and warped accretion disk are a consequence of the bardeen - petterson effect , which results from the misalignment between the angular momenta of the kerr black hole and disk . in @xmath4 2 ,",
    "we discuss the bardeen - petterson mechanism , used to calculate the time - scale for alignment between the two angular momenta . in @xmath4 3",
    "we present the physical parameters of the accretion disk of ngc1068 , as constrained by the observations found in the literature , and we use them to model the warping of the accretion disk due to the bardeen - petterson effect as a function of the alignment time - scale . in @xmath4 4 , we show how jet morphology can be used independently to estimate the alignment time - scale .",
    "conclusions are presented in @xmath4 5 .",
    "frame dragging produced by a kerr black hole causes precession of a particle if its orbital plane is inclined in relation to the equatorial plane of the black hole .",
    "the precession angular velocity @xmath5 due to the lense - thirring effect is given by ( e.g. , @xcite ) :    @xmath6     + where @xmath7 is the gravitational constant , @xmath8 is the light speed , @xmath9 is the radial distance from a black hole of mass @xmath10 and angular momentum @xmath11 , defined as @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the ratio between the actual angular momentum and its maximum possible value .    the combined action of the lense - thirring effect and the internal viscosity of the accretion disk forces the alignment between the angular momenta of the kerr black hole and the accretion disk .",
    "this is known as the bardeen - petterson effect @xcite and affects only the innermost part of the disk , because of the short range of the lense - thirring effect , while its outer parts tend to remain in its original configuration .",
    "the transition radius between these two regimes is known as bardeen - petterson radius @xmath14 , shown schematically in figure 1 ; its exact location depends mainly on the physical properties of the accretion disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "the time - scale for alignment can be calculated as ( e.g. , @xcite ) :    @xmath15     + where @xmath16 is the angle between the black hole spin axis and the direction perpendicular to the outer disk .",
    "the time derivative of @xmath11 has the form :    @xmath17     + where @xmath18 is the outer disk radius and @xmath19 is its differential angular momentum ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath20 is the disk angular velocity and @xmath21 is the surface density of the accretion disk integrated over its semi - thickness @xmath22 , derived following @xcite ( see also @xcite ) :    @xmath23     + where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the sound speed , defined as :    @xmath27     + where @xmath28 is the politropic index of the gas , which we have assumed equal to 5/3 .    a rough estimate of @xmath14 can be obtained comparing the time - scales for lense - thirring precession and warp transmission through the disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) that , on the other hand , will depend on how the warps are being communicated along it . if they are transmitted diffusively :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the viscosity acting on the direction perpendicular to the disk ; both parameters must be calculated at @xmath31 .",
    "if the time - scales for the warp and surface density evolution are similar @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the viscosity along the disk ; otherwise @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a function of the dimensionless viscosity parameter @xmath36 introduced by @xcite ; we adopted @xmath37 $ ] as derived by @xcite . assuming that the inner radius of the accretion disk is the marginally stable orbit @xmath38 , the viscosity @xmath33 can be written as :    @xmath39^{-1}\\left [   1-\\left(\\frac{r_\\mathrm{ms}}{r}\\right)^2\\frac{\\omega_\\mathrm{d}(r_\\mathrm{ms})}{\\omega_\\mathrm{d}(r ) }   \\right],\\ ] ]     + @xmath40 is the accretion rate , which is related to the bolometric luminosity @xmath41 through @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the eddington mass accretion rate and luminosity , respectively .    in the wave - like regime :    @xmath45    the transition from the diffusive to wave - like regime occurs at a radius @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the physical parameters of the black hole accretion disk system of ngc1068 were determined by @xcite and @xcite from the analysis of the maser line velocities ; they are presented in table 1 and were used in our calculations of the bardeen - petterson radius and the alignment time - scale .",
    "the maser velocities present signatures of sub - keplerian motion ;",
    "however , in equation ( 3 ) we used the relativistic keplerian angular velocity @xcite , since at the radius in which this assumption is not valid , the angular momentum @xmath47 becomes negligible .",
    "we assumed a power - law surface density distribution for the accretion disk @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the gravitational radius and @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath51 was determined from the mass of the disk @xmath52 , derived by @xcite and @xcite , integrating @xmath53 from the inner to the outer disk radius .",
    "the @xmath36-parameter was obtained from the expression @xmath54",
    "m@xmath55 yr@xmath56 given by @xcite .",
    "the accretion rate can be calculated from the bolometric luminosity @xmath57 , given the accretion efficiency @xmath58 , which depends on the black hole spin parameter @xmath13 .",
    "we used as lower limit for the bolometric luminosity @xmath59 erg s@xmath56 , as found by @xcite from the observed free - free emission , and the eddington luminosity @xmath44 as upper limit .",
    "the bardeen - petterson radius was obtained from either equation ( 6 ) or ( 8) , depending if it obeys the diffusive or wave regimes , respectively .",
    "the calculations were performed for the disk models a and b defined in table 1 , considering several values of the black hole spin and the extreme values of the accretion rate and @xmath36 parameter , the latter depending also on the spin value .",
    "the results show that the bardeen - petterson radius for ngc1068 depends weakly on the accretion rate , being limited by the variation of the black hole spin and @xmath36 parameters between 10@xmath60 and 10@xmath61 pc ( about 20 and 200 @xmath62 respectively ) as shown in left panel of figure 2 .    for the lower limit of the @xmath36 parameter and both black hole masses , @xmath63 when @xmath64 . for the upper limit of @xmath36 , @xmath65 for @xmath66 , turning gradually into @xmath67 for larger values of @xmath13 at a rate that depends on the @xmath36 parameter .",
    "we calculated the alignment time - scale as a function of the black hole spin by solving the integral given in equation ( 3 ) , using as integration limits the bardeen - petterson radius and an arbitrary outer radius .",
    "the results , which are independent of the outer radius value , are presented in the right panel of the figure 2 .",
    "the alignment time - scale turned out to vary between 100 and 10@xmath68 yr , while the lifetime of the radio jet in ngc1068 is @xmath69 yr @xcite , similar to the lifetimes of agn activity .",
    "therefore , it indicates that the bardeen - petterson effect can perfectly warp the inner part of the accretion disk .",
    "it is important to emphasize that warped accretion disks produced by the bardeen - petterson effect can be probed by features in relativistically broadened emission iron - line profiles @xcite but unfortunately , since ngc1068 is a type 2 seyfert galaxy , relativistically broadened iron - lines are unlikely to be observed due to the obscuring dust torus .",
    "the current angular resolution provided by interferometric techniques is not capable to resolve structures with sizes comparable to the bardeen - petterson radius in ngc1068 .",
    "however , the orientation of the inner part of the disk can be traced from the jet , which is usually thought ( sometimes supported by observations ; @xcite ) to be ejected in the perpendicular direction . in ngc1068 ,",
    "the jet is not continuous but presents discrete features , the upper limit to their expanding velocities being 0.17@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the bardeen - petterson effect forces the disk to align gradually with the black hole , producing precession and a progressive change in the jet direction @xcite . according to @xcite",
    ", the solution of equation ( 3 ) gives an exponential time variation for the inclination angle between black hole spin and the jet direction , as well as for the precession period @xmath70 :    @xmath71    @xmath72     + where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are , respectively , the inclination angle and precession period at time @xmath75 when the disk was formed ( @xmath76 , measured in the past from the present time ) .",
    "@xcite found that the timescales for precession and realignment are identical , implying that @xmath77 , which will be also consider in our approach .",
    "we assumed that the jet originated at time @xmath75 , afterwards each plasma element was ejected with constant speed @xmath78 at a time @xmath79 , in a direction that forms an angle @xmath80 with the black hole spin axis , in a plane that rotates with velocity @xmath81 .",
    "we introduced two additional parameters : the viewing and position angle of the black hole spin in relation to the line of sight @xmath82 and on the plane of the sky @xmath83 .    in order to compare our model with the observations , we calculated the right ascension and declination offsets ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively ) of each jet element as a function of time through :    @xmath86,\\ ] ]    @xmath87,\\ ] ]     + where @xmath88 is the distance to the observer , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we found solutions for several combinations of the input parameters , in the range @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the parameters @xmath75 and @xmath94 are scaled by the jet velocity , ranging between @xmath95 ( yr)@xmath96 and @xmath97 ( yr)@xmath98 for @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "the limits found for @xmath94 are perfectly compatible with those derived in last section .    in figure 3",
    "we present the comparison between the parsec and kiloparsec scale radio maps @xcite and a model with parameters @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 yr , @xmath103 yr , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "we can see that our simple kinematic approach reproduces satisfactorily the inverted s - shape of the kiloparsec jet , as well as the location of its jet components ; at parsec - scales , the position of the jet components c and ne , as well as the counterjet knot s2 are also well - reproduced by the same model . as it can be seen in the left panel of figure 3 , at larger distances from the core , the full range of position angles provided by our precessing model is not found in the observational data , in the sense that the amplitude of the helix towards the northern and southern regions are systematically larger than the observed jet aperture .",
    "this may be due to the implicit assumption of accretion disk rigid - body precession during all the jet - time evolution , which might not be totally true , specially close to the initial time @xmath75 .",
    "in fact , numerical simulations have shown a period of differential precession preceding the rigid - body configuration @xcite .",
    "in addition , the galactic medium will influence the jet propagation , as can be seen from the [ ] and mid - infrared images of ngc1068 @xcite , showing the existence of jet - ambient interaction .    in all cases considered in this work ,",
    "the inner disk is not completely aligned with the equator of the black hole since @xmath106 at the present time .",
    "interestingly , @xcite proposed the existence of a slight tilt of @xmath107 between the compton thick central absorber and the molecular disc in order to reproduce the observed distribution of h@xmath0 and co emission in this object .",
    "we studied the possibility that the bardeen - petterson effect is responsible for the warping of the accretion disk in ngc1068 , as derived from the radio continuum and water maser observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such mechanism arises from the frame dragging produced by a kerr black hole whose rotation axis is not parallel to that of the accretion disk .    using an analytical approach ,",
    "similar to that suggested by @xcite and @xcite , we calculated the bardeen - petterson radius and the alignment time - scale between the accretion disk and the equator plane of the black hole for different values of the black hole spin .",
    "we found that the bardeen - petterson radius is roughly limited between 10@xmath60 and 10@xmath61 pc , while the alignment time - scale ranges from about 100 to @xmath108 yr . those estimates are perfectly compatible with the upper limit to the agn lifetime , derived from the jet kinematics .",
    "we also showed that the general form of the parsec and kiloparsec scale jets can be reproduced by the model in which the jet is precessing with a period @xmath109 and aperture angle @xmath16 that decrease exponentially with a time - scale @xmath110 , as expected from the bardeen - petterson effect .",
