    "the system is located at a distance of approximately 6 kpc from earth .",
    "it consists of an a7 type stellar companion ( hz her ) which varies between late a and early b with the orbital phase , and a neutron star ( her x-1 ) with masses @xmath12.2 @xmath7 and @xmath11.5 @xmath7 , respectively ( reynolds et al .",
    "an updated set of binary parameters is given by @xcite .",
    "it is one of the few neutron star binaries to have low interstellar absorption , which makes it feasible for observation and study at various wavelengths ( e.g. leahy 2003 , leahy 2002 , scott et al .",
    "2000 , scott & leahy 1999 ) .",
    "it is additionally of special interest because it is the neutron star with the best - known mass - to - radius ratio @xcite .",
    "this value was made possible by a definitive determination of the geometry of the emitting region on the neutron star from a study of the 35-day evolution of the pulse profile @xcite .",
    "thus it of great interest to constrain the mass of the neutron star better than the current range of @xmath81.3 - 1.5@xmath6 .",
    "this would allow the determination of both mass and radius with tight constraints and form a strong constraint on equations of state for dense matter in neutron stars .",
    "emission from her x-1/hz her covers the optical , ultraviolet , euv and x - ray regime and models for the , often coupled , emission processes must ultimately be consistent .",
    "x - ray spectra of her x-1 are discussed by @xcite and @xcite ( from bepposax ) , @xcite ( from asca ) and @xcite ( from ginga ) . the hard x - rays ( @xmath9 kev )",
    "arise as a result of mass accretion onto the neutron star and are modulated by the neutron star rotation and obscuration by the accretion disk ( e.g. scott et al .",
    "2000 and references therein ) , companion star and cold gas in the system that causes the absorption dips ( leahy 1997 , igna and leahy 2011 , igna and leahy 2012 ) .",
    "a small reflected / reprocessed x - ray component is present that is observable during the low state and eclipses ( choi et al .",
    "1994 , leahy et al .",
    "a major portion of the observed optical / ultraviolet emission is believed to arise from x - ray heating of hz her and the accretion disk .",
    "the x - ray heating causes the surface temperature of hz her facing the neutron star to be approximately 10,000 degrees higher than the cooler shadowed side @xcite .",
    "analysis of ultraviolet spectra of her x-1 are presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "optical signatures of reprocessing on the companion and accretion disk are discussed by @xcite .",
    "observations of the broad band optical emission of hz her / her x-1 have been presented by @xcite and @xcite , among others . between the hard x - ray and optical / ultraviolet band",
    "lies the soft x - ray / extreme ultraviolet band ( @xmath10 @xmath11 1 kev ) .",
    "a blackbody spectral component has been detected by many previous observations with a temperature of about 0.1 kev ( e.g. shulman et al .",
    "1975 , oosterbroek et al .",
    "2000)and generally has been attributed to reprocessing of hard x - rays in the inner region of the accretion disk ( e.g. mccray et al .",
    "1982 , oosterbroek et al .",
    "her x-1 shows a variety of phenomena at different timescales , including 1.24 second pulsations , orbital eclipses with period of 1.7 days , and a 35-day cycle in the x - ray flux .",
    "the latter normally consists of a bright state , known as the main high state , which lasts 10 - 12 days and an intermediate - brightness state , the short high state , which lasts 5 - 7 days .",
    "these two states are separated by 8 - 10 day long low states .",
    "the precessing accretion disk causes the alternating pattern of high and low x - ray intensity states by periodically blocking the neutron star from view .",
    "the initial rapid flux rise over a few hours marks the start of a high state and is known as the `` turn - on '' .",
    "this event is the emergence of the neutron star from behind the moving outer disk edge ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "discussions of the properties of the 35-day cycle are given by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the x - ray pulse profile evolution has been convincingly linked to the precessing accretion disk by @xcite . over the course of the 35-day cycle ,",
    "the broadband optical emission exhibits a complex , systematic variation , in addition to the orbital modultation due to x - ray heating of hz her .",
    "this pattern is a consequence of disk emission and of disk shadowing / occultation of the heated face of hz her by the precessing accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the regular variability in her x-1 that is of interest here is x - ray eclipse of the neutron star during main high . during main high",
    "the observer has a direct view of the neutron star , so that eclipse probes the structure of the companion star hz her .",
    "the previous study of this nature was carried out by @xcite using one eclipse observed with ginga .",
    "here we consider all main high eclipses from the rxte / pca data archive , covering more than one decade of observations of her x-1 .",
    "accurate measurements of the radius of hz her are made and combined with constraints from optical spectra of hz her during eclipse , which yield effective temperature ( @xmath3 ) and metallicity ( z ) , to obtain a new distance to the system .",
    "we compare the observationally determined radius and effective temperature to stellar evolution calculations to determine allowed masses for hz her , then use those to explore the allowed parameters of the system , including the mass of the neutron star .",
    "a summary analysis of the entire rxte / pca set of standard 2 data is given in @xcite .",
    "we are here interested in analyzing main high ingresses or egresses to obtain values of the radius of hz her .",
    "these eclipses are known to occur rapidly ( over a few minutes ) at orbital phases @xmath80.93 and @xmath80.07 ( e.g. leahy and yoshida 1995)and are caused by the limb of hz her covering the observer s line - of - sight to the neutron star .",
    "the part of the data which occurs during main high state was determined here using the main high turn - on times of @xcite .",
    "the main high data was , in turn , searched for all data during orbital phases of eclipse ( including ingress and egress : phase 0.92 to 1.08 ) .",
    "nineteen different eclipses were observed with varying amounts of phase coverage .",
    "counting the ingress part ( phase 0.92 to 1.0 ) and egress part ( phase 0.0 to 0.08 ) separately , there were 23 ingresses or egresses during main high state .",
    "some of these were observed with too little phase coverage to measure the ingress or egress light curve .",
    "several other ingresses or egresses include cold matter absorption immediately around the time of ingress or egress .",
    "this is seen from the low ( 2 - 4 kev)/(9 - 20 kev ) softness ratio coinciding with below - normal count rates , which indicates absorption .",
    "sporadic absorption events ( dips ) are regularly seen during main high state .",
    "this has been recently quantified by @xcite : their fig .",
    "5 shows the data for main high state folded on the orbital period , with absorption dips seen as drops in count rate simultaneous with a decrease in the ( 2 - 4 kev)/(9 - 20 kev ) softness ratio ; their fig .",
    "7 shows the fraction of time spent in dips to the total time observed as a function of orbital phase in main high state . around time of eclipse",
    ", this fraction is between 0.3 and 0.6 .",
    "there were four clear ( without excess absorption ) ingresses and four clear egresses suitable for analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the rxte ( 9 - 20kev ) light curves for these eight ingresses / egresses and table  [ tbl - data ] gives the mjd , 35 day phase and orbital phase coverage of these observations .      to model the system orbit we use the most recent published orbital parameters , given by @xcite .",
    "these parameters are summarized here in table  [ tbl - orbit ] . to calculate the absolute size of the orbit ,",
    "the mass ratio is needed , which can be found from the amplitude of the velocity of the companion star hz her , @xmath12 , together with the amplitude of the velocity of the neutron star , @xmath13 ( from @xmath14 ) .",
    "because @xmath13 is already very well known through pulse time delays , a good value for @xmath12 is needed .",
    "the best - fit value @xcite is @xmath12=109 km / s with a quoted statistical error of 3 km / s and systematic error of @xmath110 km / s . here ,",
    "in addition to the best - fit case , we take a low @xmath12 case of 99 km / s and a high @xmath12 case of 119 km / s value .",
    "a range of inclinations between @xmath15 and @xmath16 was chosen , which is somewhat larger than normally adopted inclinations ( @xmath17 to @xmath18 ) to explain the 35 day cycle ( see e.g. leahy 2002).the inclination and @xmath12 values significantly affect the orbit size and the masses of the two components hz her and her x-1 , as shown in table  [ tbl - mass ] ; errors in the masses and size of the orbit have a negligible contribution from the other measured orbital parameters .",
    "a numerical model was constructed and fitted to the observed light - curves to determine the radius of hz her .",
    "the duration of eclipse in orbital phase is determined by the amount of angle , relative to 360@xmath19 of a full rotation of the binary system , during which hz her blocks the line - of - sight to the neutron star .",
    "the conversion of this angle into physical size depends on the binary separation , a. the conversion of this size into a stellar radius depends on the binary inclination , i , as the line - of - sight makes a different cut across the back face of the star depending on inclination .",
    "a few approximations are made in the model used here .",
    "the eccentricity of the orbit is very small ( see table  [ tbl - orbit ] ) , enough that use a circular orbit gives accurate results ( to 1 part in @xmath20 ) .",
    "the atmosphere of the star was taken to have an exponential density profile , and the radius of the star was defined as the radius where the vertical optical depth was unity in the 9 - 20 kev x - ray band . for the 9 - 20 kev band , the absorption plus scattering opacity",
    "was taken to be sum of the photoelectric and thompson cross - sections , using matter of solar composition .",
    "the neutron star is taken as a point source of x - rays .",
    "the accretion column that emits the bulk of the x - rays is small enough ( @xmath21a few km , leahy 2004 , leahy 2004b ) that a point source is a good assumption for the x - ray source .",
    "a few km is small compared to the next smallest scale involved , which is the scale height of the atmosphere of hz her ( @xmath22 cm , leahy and yoshida 1995 ) .",
    "hz her is essentially roche - lobe filling ( e.g. leahy and scott 1998 ) , so it is not spherical but has the shape of the roche lobe .",
    "the model initially uses a spherical star , and yields the impact parameter from the center of the star to the line - of - sight through the stellar surface at vertical optical depth unity .",
    "we call this distance @xmath23 ( or for simplicity , just @xmath24 ) . knowing the shape of the roche lobe , which depends only on @xmath2",
    ", we use @xmath24 to calculate the distance to any other part of the surface on the roche lobe .",
    "we fit the model to each of the eight observed ingresses and egresses .",
    "the mjd52599 egress ( fig.1 top panel ) shows a extended slow rise after orbital phase 0.068 : the fit for this egress was restricted to the early sharp rising part of the egress . for the mjd52599 ingress ( fig.1 bottom panel )",
    "there is a shallow decrease prior to the main sharp ingress- the fit was restricted to the sharp part of the ingress .",
    "the eight ingresses / egresses were fit separately is to demonstrate that a single radius can explain all events , so that there is no evidence that the radius of hz her is time - variable . the resulting radii ( @xmath24 ) and scaleheights ( h )",
    "are given in table  [ tbl - eclipse85 ] for the case of @xmath25 inclination and @xmath12=109 km / s .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath24 is @xmath26 cm and of h is @xmath27 cm ( i.e. similar in absolute magnitude , but the relative uncertainty in @xmath24 is three orders of magnitude smaller ) .",
    "we find that for a given inclination and @xmath12 , all eight eclipses give the same @xmath24 within errors .",
    "this confirms we are measuring the radius of hz her and not some other variable phenomenon , e.g. related to the accretion disk or stream . as a result",
    ", we average @xmath24 over the eight eclipses for each inclination and @xmath12 and present the results in table [ tbl - eclipseav ] .    for all of the eclipses , inclinations and @xmath12 values ,",
    "@xmath28 is consistent with a constant value of @xmath29 cm , consistent with the value found by @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath24 here is estimated from the root - mean - square of the eight best - fit values of @xmath24 for each inclination at @xmath12 value , which ranges from @xmath30 to @xmath31 cm for the fifteen different cases .",
    "next we calculate a correction for the non - spherical shape of the surface of the star , which is filling its roche lobe , using the standard roche potential .",
    "the radius derived for a spherical star , @xmath24 ( listed in table  [ tbl - eclipseav ] ) , is from the center of hz her , to the point on the roche lobe surface tangent to the line - of - sight from observer to neutron star .",
    "we will need the cross - sectional area of the star viewed by the observer : this will be used in sect .",
    "4.1 together with the surface flux to derive the distance to the binary . for the fifteen different cases ( five inclinations and three mass ratios- see table  [ tbl - mass ] ) @xmath24 ranged from 0.412 to 0.441 times the orbital separation . to determine the cross - sectional area of the star at mid - eclipse , because the system inclination is near 90@xmath19 , we can use the area of an ellipse with major - axis radius @xmath24 , and minor axis the polar radius of the roche lobe of hz her .",
    "we find the polar radius ranges from 0.943 to 0.948 times @xmath24 .",
    "thus to accuracy of about one part in 400 , we use a fixed ratio of 0.9455 for all cases , which gives a cross - sectional area during eclipse of @xmath32 .    for comparison with stellar models ,",
    "one needs the radius of a sphere , @xmath33 , with the same volume as the distorted star . in the case of hz",
    "her the star just fills its roche lobe , so we can use the formula of @xcite which relates @xmath34 to mass ratio , @xmath2 . for the three different cases of mass ratio here",
    "( see table  [ tbl - mass ] ) one obtains @xmath35 0.426 , 0.417 and 0.410 , respectively . to determine the radius of the spherical star of the same volume , the @xmath24 radii in table  [ tbl - eclipseav ] need to be multiplied by the ratio of @xmath36 , which depends on mass ratio , @xmath2 , and inclination .",
    "for @xmath2=0.586 , this ratio ranges from to 1.0047 ( @xmath15 inclination ) to 1.0025 ( @xmath16 ) , while for @xmath2=0.645 , the range is 1.0060 to 1.0041 , and for @xmath2=0.704 , it is 1.0071 to 1.0052 .",
    "thus to one part in 400 , this ratio can be take as 1.005 for all cases here .",
    "however , we used the more accurate numerically calculated value of the ratio to obtain @xmath33 for each case of @xmath2 and inclination separately .",
    "during eclipse of the neutron star , only the unheated surface of hz her is viewed from earth .",
    "the optical spectrum during eclipse has been used to estimate the luminosity and thus distance of hz her / her x-1 previously ( e.g. oke 1976 , cheng et al .",
    "here we compare moderately high resolution optical observations to the detailed set of stellar atmosphere spectra computed by @xcite over a comprehensive grid in @xmath3 and log(@xmath37 ) and with log(g ) set to the value appropriate for hz her .",
    "high resolution optical spectra of hz her during orbital eclipse were published by @xcite , and were taken with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "faint object spectrograph ( fos ) ( for the wavelength ranges @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) and with the _ kitt peak national observatory _",
    "goldcam instrument ( for the wavelength ranges @xmath40 ) .",
    "however , as noted by @xcite , the goldcam spectrum is not flux calibrated , so is not suitable for use in quantitative modeling .",
    "earlier spectrophotometry for the wavelength range @xmath41 was published by @xcite for orbital phase 0.011 ( hereafter referred to as oke data ) : those data have absolute flux calibration and are suitable for use here .",
    "the goldcam data was directly compared to the oke data .",
    "it is found that the goldcam data is slightly different in shape but noticibly higher ( 15% ) in flux- much larger than the data errors .",
    "this confirms the lack of flux calibration of the goldcam data .",
    "the hst / fos , goldcam and oke data sets are not simultaneous , but the back side of hz her should not be variable .",
    "the hst / fos data covers two wavelength ranges ( 2220 to 3200@xmath42 and 1285 to 1604@xmath42 ) and were taken with resolution @xmath43 @xmath81300 .",

    "the short wavelength hst / fos data ( 1285@xmath42 to 1604@xmath42 ) from figure 2b of that paper were not used for final analysis because they are dominated by the line emission from hot gas ( e.g. anderson 1994 , cheng 1995 ) and not hz her .",

    "the kurucz model atmosphere data was rebinned to match the bins for lower - resolution oke data in the range 3280 to 9880@xmath42 .",
    "this resulted in 183 wavelength bins for the observations and the matching kurucz models .",
    "fitting was based on least - squares ( @xmath50 ) minimization . to be conservative and to allow for some systematic errors ,",
    "the estimated errors of the hst / fos and oke data sets were multiplied by a factor of 1.8 .",
    "this does not affect the best fits but makes the 2 and 3 @xmath4 limits on @xmath3 and log(@xmath37 ) obtained from the spectral fits somewhat larger ( about a factor of 2 ) than if no allowance is made for an additional source of error .",
    "the resulting allowed mass range of hz her is @xmath82.2 to 2.5 @xmath6 ( see table  [ tbl - mass ] ) with higher values for lower inclinations .",
    "the stellar radius from the eclipse fits gives higher values for lower inclinations , resulting in a calculated surface gravity of log(g ) nearly equal 3.50 for all inclinations .",
    "thus we fixed log(g)=3.50 for all stellar atmosphere models , leaving @xmath3 and log(@xmath37 ) as free parameters .",
    "we carried out fits of stellar atmosphere spectra for a wide range of @xmath3 and log(@xmath37 ) .",

    "the resulting distances are given in table  [ tbl - distance ] .",
    "the distances are the best - fit values and the larger ( smaller ) of the two upper ( lower ) limits to distance from the 2@xmath4 @xmath3 and log(@xmath37 ) limits determined above . because the measured stellar radius , @xmath24 from the x - ray eclipses depends on inclination , the best - fit distance and upper and lower limits depend on inclination .",
    "our results are about 5% smaller than the distance derived by @xcite , which is mainly attributed to our @xmath3 of @xmath55k , which is lower than the value of @xmath56k they used from @xcite .",

    "the code itself is an updated version of the of the @xcite code , which includes several improvements including the ability to evolve past the helium flash in low mass stars . in this simplified treatment",
    "we do not take into account effects of the binary on the stellar evolution , even though there is evidence of mass transfer from the progenitor of her x-1 onto hz her from the enhanced n abundance of hz her @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of stellar evolution is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "even so , the available standard stellar evolutionary models in the mass range of interest ( 2 - 2.5 @xmath6 ) are sufficiently reliable to infer the properties of hz her .",

    "the evolutionary tracks for stars of 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 and 2.5 @xmath6 are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] for the region of interest here : from zero - age main sequence until they become too cool to possibly represent the current stage of hz her , which has @xmath61 7800k .",
    "we next compare the evolutionary tracks with the limits on effective temperature @xmath3 and stellar radius @xmath62 .",

    "the measured stellar radius @xmath62 has negligible uncertainty other than that from the uncertainty in inclination and @xmath12 .",
    "we note that each different evolutionary track is essentially a constant mass track because the mass loss rates are very small prior to ascending the giant branch .",
    "the result is that , with fixed mass for each evolutionary track , @xmath12 and inclination are no longer independent variables .",
    "we can take @xmath12 to be a function of inclination .",

    "the radius at the minimum inclination is larger than that for the maximum inclination , which happens because the line - of - sight from observer to neutron star makes a cut across the stellar surface at higher latitude at lower inclination . from table",
    "[ tbl - massnew ] it is seen that the upper and lower limits to stellar radius , @xmath62 , are significantly different for different masses of hz her .",
    "the net result is that each evolutionary track has it own @xmath62 limits and ( common ) @xmath3 limits .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows example evolutionary tracks in the @xmath62 vs. @xmath3 plane for m=2.22 and 2.25 @xmath6 and the @xmath62 limits and @xmath3 limits for these two cases . as time increase the tracks move up and to the left in the diagram , then turn to move down and to the right ( a brief time of increasing temperature and decreasing radius ) , and then move upward and left as the star becomes a red giant .",
    "for both 2.22 and 2.25 @xmath6 cases , the evolutionary tracks cross their respective allowed regions only during the short phase of increasing temperature and decreasing radius just prior to central hydrogen exhaustion .",
    "we explore a range of masses . below 2.15 @xmath6",
    ", the evolutionary track does not pass into the allowed @xmath62-@xmath3 region but below and left of it . between 2.15 and 2.20 @xmath6 , the point of central hydrogen exhaustion is inside the allowed region , and the duration that the evolutionary track is in the allowed region is short ( @xmath1100kyr ) . between 2.20 and 2.35 @xmath6 ,",
    "the situation is like that for 2.22 and 2.25 @xmath6 cases , where the evolutionary track only crosses the allowed region during the phase of increasing temperature and decreasing radius . between 2.35 and 2.45 @xmath6 ,",
    "the evolutionary track crosses the allowed region before the rightward excursion in the @xmath62 vs. @xmath3 diagram , with decreasing temperature and increasing radius ( before the leftward turn in the h - r diagram , see figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "masses above 2.45 @xmath6 do not cross the allowed region in the @xmath62 vs. @xmath3 diagram : all three parts of the evolutionary track pass above ( too large @xmath62 ) and to the right ( too large @xmath3 ) of the allowed region .    the requirement that the evolutionary track passes through the allowed @xmath62-@xmath3 region , gives a maximum mass of 2.45 @xmath6 .",
    "if we make the sensible requirement that hz her is in a phase of expanding radius , to drive the mass accretion onto the neutron star , then the mass range 2.20 to 2.35 @xmath6 is not allowed .",
    "this leaves two allowed mass ranges . for 2.15 to 2.20",
    "@xmath6 , the track is inside the allowed region and has increasing radius just after the point of central hydrogen exhaustion .",
    "the rate of radius expansion from the stellar models is rapid , @xmath68cm / s , and the duration that the track is inside the allowed region is very short . for 2.35 to 2.45 @xmath6 ,",
    "the track is inside the allowed region with increasing radius .",
    "the rate of radius expansion is slower , @xmath69cm / s , but the duration that the track is inside the allowed region is longer ( @xmath11 - 2myr for 2.35 and 2.45 @xmath6 and @xmath110myr for 2.40 @xmath6 , where the track crosses the center of the allowed region ) .",
    "we take a mass ( 2.40 @xmath6 ) near the centre of the higher mass allowed region as an example case to illustrate the evolutionary state of hz her .",
    "the star enters the allowed region for hz her in the @xmath62-@xmath3 plane at an age of 616 myr .",
    "it leaves the allowed region at an age of 628 myr .",
    "shortly thereafter the radius continues to expand , then it decreases for a short time just before the age of 666 myr .",
    "at this time the radius starts to rapidly increase , while at the same time , the surface temperature changes from increasing to decreasing again .",
    "this point is marked by central h exhaustion and by the change in direction in @xmath3 ( see figure  [ fig5 ] for the 2.22 @xmath6 case ) .",
    "it corresponds to the sharp change in direction in the hr diagram in figure  [ fig4 ] ( seen as a cusp for the 2.3 and 2.4 @xmath6 evolutionary tracks ; for 2.2 and 2.5 @xmath6 cases the timesteps occured on either side of the time of central h exhaustion so the cusp was not resolved ) .",
    "additionally , this point is marked by a jump in h - burning cno cycle luminosity ( from roughly 70 to 90 @xmath70 ) , while the surface luminosity does not change rapidly ( nearly steady at 78 @xmath70 ) ) , rather the interior structure of the star is adjusting .",
    "he burning does not begin until 13 million years after this point in time . between the time of central h exhaustion and time of he",
    "ignition the central density of the core increases from @xmath71 to @xmath72g/@xmath73 .",
    "we note that when hz her enters the stage of rapid radius expansion , the mass - loss rate onto her x-1 will increase dramatically , by a factor of @xmath74 .",
    "this higher mass loss rate is super - eddington , because the current mass transfer rate is at about 0.1 of the eddington rate .",
    "the likely outcome is unstable mass transfer , which happens for systems where mass transfer occurs from the more massive to less massive component , giving shrinkage of the orbit .",
    "this instability occurs on a dynamical timescale and likely yields a common envelope system ( see ivanova et al .",
    "2013 for a recent review of common envelope systems ) .",
    "the common envelope system can leave behind a compact binary if the envelope is successfully ejected , consisting of the neutron star and the remaining white dwarf core of hz her . in this case the white dwarf would be a he white - dwarf , because he burning has not started in the core at the time of onset of the instability .",
    "the neutron star can accrete from the white dwarf , giving an lmxb system , which could subsequently evolve into a millisecond pulsar with a he white dwarf companion when the accretion ceases .",
    "new limits on @xmath62 and @xmath3 for hz her have been determined here . by comparing with stellar evolution calculations ,",
    "two allowed narrow mass ranges are found : 2.15 to 2.20 @xmath6 if hz her has just past central hydrogen exhaustion , and 2.35 to 2.45 @xmath6 if hz her has not yet reached central hydrogen exhaustion .",
    "since the duration of the evolutionary track in the allowed @xmath62 and @xmath3 region is about 100 times less for the lower mass range ( 100kyr vs. 10myr ) , the upper mass range is much more likely .    for either range",
    ", we can use the new limits on the mass of hz her , together with the information summarized in table  [ tbl - massnew ] , to narrow the original range of mass of her x-1 ( @xmath67 ) , system inclination , and @xmath12 ( given in table  [ tbl - mass ] ) .",
    "we note that the mass ratio , @xmath75 , can be computed using the standard formula @xmath76 , valid for a circular orbit , which is a good approximation here given the very small orbital eccentricity . for the lower mass range",
    ", one finds @xmath77 , @xmath78 and 99 km / s@xmath79102.8 km / s . for the higher mass range , one obtains @xmath80 , @xmath81 and 105.6 km / s@xmath79119 km / s . the lower mass range for hz her yields a low - mass neutron star and the high mass range yields a high - mass neutron star , but consistent with previously published estimates .",
    "however here , table  [ tbl - massnew ] specifies the dependence of neutron star mass on inclination , @xmath12 and mass of hz her , so that an improvement in measurement of one of these quantities can yield a significant reduction in the allowed neutron star mass range .",
    "further , with the two new allowed mass ranges for hz her , the distance limits ( see table  [ tbl - distance ] ) can be improved slightly . for the lower mass range , which has @xmath78 and 99 km / s@xmath79102.8 km / s ,",
    "the upper and lower distance limits are 5.73 and 6.29 kpc . for the higher mass range , which has 105.6 km / s@xmath79119 km / s ,",
    "the distance limits are 5.87 and 6.78 kpc .",
    "the uncertainties in inclination and @xmath12 both contribute to the distance uncertainty , so that even with the constraint on the mass of hz her , the distance uncertainty is large .",
    "in this work , we analyzed x - ray eclipses of her x-1 observed by the rxte / pca .",
    "a total of eight eclipse ingresses and egresses were found during main high state which were free of absorption dips .",
    "these eclipses were modeled to measure the radius of hz her and scale height of the atmosphere .",
    "the scale height was found to be consistent with the previous determination by @xcite .",
    "the radius measurements are the first accurate radius measurements of hz her , and have small statistical uncertainty ( 1 part in 1000 ) , with additional uncertainty caused by the unknown inclination and mass ratio of the hz her / her x-1 binary system .",
    "the currently known orbital parameters , including an extreme range of inclinations ( 80 to 90@xmath19 ) and range of @xmath12 ( radial velocity amplitude of hz her , equivalent to @xmath2 ) are summarized in table  [ tbl - orbit ] .",
    "the implied semi - major axis and masses of hz her ( @xmath65 ) and her x-1(@xmath67 ) are given in table  [ tbl - mass ] .",
    "we found that the radii derived from all eight eclipse observations agree with eachother , which confirms that we obtained a reliable measurement of radius of hz her .",
    "the resulting measured radius as a function of inclination and @xmath12 is given in table  [ tbl - eclipseav ] .",
    "next we considered the constraint on hz her from its optical spectrum observed during mid - eclipse , when we see only the unheated face of hz her .",
    "we fitted the spectrum with kurucz model atmospheres for a range of @xmath3 and metallicity with the surface gravity determined by the allowed masses ( from orbital parameters ) and allowed radii ( from x - ray eclipse ) .",
    "we determined a 2@xmath4 allowed range in @xmath3 of 7720k to 7865k , and in metallicity of log(@xmath37)=-0.27 to + 0.03 . with the observed continuum flux from hz",
    "her during mid - eclipse , we used the model surface flux and its 2@xmath4 ranges to determine a best - fit distance to hz her and 2@xmath4 upper and lower limits . because the radius inferred from eclipse",
    "depends on inclination and @xmath12 , the results are presented in table  [ tbl - distance ] as a function of inclination and @xmath12 . the best - fit distance is 6.08 kpc , and the overall upper and lower limits are 5.73 kpc and 6.98 kpc at the extremes of allowed inclination and @xmath12 .",
    "next we computed stellar evolutionary tracks for stars of various mass and solar metallicity consistent with the narrow metallicity range from the spectral fits .",
    "we required consistency of the model stars with both the temperature @xmath3 and radius of hz her , which has not been done before .",
    "the radius derived from x - ray eclipse depends on inclination and @xmath12 , so each model mass has a different constraint on radius .",
    "we calculated the constraints separately for each model mass .",
    "only stars with mass in the one of two ranges of ( 2.15 to 2.20 @xmath6 and 2.35 to 2.45 @xmath6 ) agree with the @xmath3 and radius constraints at some point in their stellar evolution .",
    "model stars in the low mass range are just past the time of central hydrogen exhaustion in their evolution .",
    "model stars in the higher mass range are not much younger than the time of central hydrogen exhaustion . for the low mass range",
    ", the star is just entering the phase of rapid radius expansion , which should lead to rapid , unstable mass transfer . for the higher mass range",
    ", the star will enter this phase in about 40 myr from now . at the time of rapid radius expansion ,",
    "hz her / her x-1 will likely become a common envelope system , and then may emerge as an lmxb ( neutron star with he white dwarf companion ) .    with the new mass limits on hz her from the stellar evolution calculations the range of allowed mass of the neutron star was determined . for the lower mass range ,",
    "the neutron star is low mass ( @xmath82 ) , while for the higher mass range , the neutron star is high mass ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "improvement in measurement of @xmath12 or system inclination can lead to significant improvement in the limits on distance to her x-1 and on neutron star mass .",

    "<S> the radius is 2.58 to 3.01 @xmath0 cm , depending on system inclination and mass ratio(q ) , with accuracy of @xmath11 part in 1000 for given inclination and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we fit kurucz model stellar atmosphere models to archival optical observations . the resulting effective temperature ( @xmath3 ) of the unheated face of hz her </S>",
    "<S> is determined to be in the 2@xmath4 range 7720k to 7865k , and metallicity ( @xmath5 ) in the range -0.27 to + .03 . the model atmosphere surface flux and new radius yield a new distance to hz her/ her x-1 , depending on system inclination and @xmath2 : a best - fit value of 6.1 kpc with upper and lower limits of 5.7 kpc and 7.0 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate stellar evolution models for the range of allowed masses ( from orbital parameters ) , and allowed metallicities ( from optical spectrum fits ) . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar models agree with @xmath3 and radius of hz her for two narrow ranges of mass : 2.15 to 2.20 @xmath6 and 2.35 to 2.45 @xmath6 this lower mass range implies a low neutron star mass ( 1.3 @xmath6 ) , whereas the higher mass range implies a high neutron star mass ( 1.5 - 1.7 @xmath6 ) . </S>"
