    "in a seminal paper , kohn and luttinger @xcite ( kl ) presented a perturbative argument showing that the generic ground state of a fermi liquid at weak coupling is superconducting , even if the bare electron - electron interaction is not attractive in the cooper channel in any angular momentum sector . recently",
    ", this result has been rederived utilizing various versions of the renormalization group method.@xcite    however , no attempt has been made so far to construct a variational wavefunction for a kl superconductor , which could be ( at least in principle ) tested in a direct numerical simulation .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to construct such a wavefunction for the repulsive hubbard model in the limit of weak coupling @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the local repulsive interaction and @xmath7 is the electron bandwidth .",
    "our strategy follows quite closely the canonical transformation approach to the electron - phonon problem introduced by frhlich @xcite and sketched in the appendix .",
    "in some sense it is also similar to the customary analysis of the hubbard model close to half filling in the limit of strong coupling @xmath8 .",
    "namely , in the latter case a canonical transformation can be found @xcite which transforms the purely repulsive hubbard model to the so - called @xmath0-@xmath9 model which explicitly contains an attractive interaction ( of the order @xmath10 ) favoring the formation of singlet superconductivity .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath0-@xmath9 model contains a constraint on the local number of electrons and as such is very difficult to study . here",
    ", on the other hand , we construct a canonical transformation which eliminates the scattering of quasiparticles to first order in @xmath11 and generates a weak - coupling model with an attractive interaction of the order @xmath12 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "the construction of the effective model is described in section ii and our method is applied to the two - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 hubbard model in section iii .",
    "we consider the hubbard model on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions and @xmath13 sites , described by the hamiltonian @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the kinetic energy operator and the interaction term has been split into two parts : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the total electron number and the total spin , respectively .",
    "terms which are not extensive in the thermodynamic limit @xmath19 have been neglected .",
    "@xmath20 is the generic interaction term which scatters electrons from @xmath21 to @xmath22 and from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "the prime on the summation means that terms with @xmath25 ( forward scattering channel ) , @xmath26 ( exchange channel ) , and @xmath27 ( cooper channel ) are excluded from @xmath20 and are singled out into @xmath28 .",
    "the operator @xmath29 can be thought of as a reduced bcs hamiltonian of a landau fermi liquid , while @xmath20 contains the scattering processes leading to a finite lifetime of the landau quasiparticles .",
    "now we look for a canonical transformation from the bare electrons to the dressed ones , @xmath30 , such that the scattering of the quasiparticles vanishes to first order in @xmath6 .",
    "this happens if @xmath31=0 $ ] in which case we can write @xmath32+i[s , h_2]/2 $ ] , where terms of order @xmath33 have been neglected . making use of the identity",

    "note that the forward , exchange , and cooper channel processes do not contribute to @xmath37 . in order to calculate the commutators",
    "@xmath38 $ ] and @xmath39 $ ] we first note that the operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 commute with the operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 and therefore @xmath44=[a , b]xy+ba[x , y ] .",

    "the result is fairly involved , including also three - body forces among the electrons .",
    "nevertheless , the expectation value @xmath47 in a bcs state @xmath48 takes a simple and physically transparent form , @xmath49    where we have introduced a momentum - resolved bcs order parameter @xmath50 and we assumed @xmath51 . in the cooper channel the effective interaction reads @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the real part of the particle - hole susceptibility @xmath54 .",
    "the physical content of the kl argument is that the effective interaction between the dressed electrons can be attractive in the cooper channel in some angular momentum sector .",
    "if this is the case , then the energy @xmath55 is minimized by nonvanishing @xmath56 and the wavefunction @xmath57 provides a variational ansatz for the kl superconductor .    before proceeding we would like to point out that our variational approach bears some similarity to a very recent formulation of the flow equation method.@xcite the comparison of both methods is left for future .",
    "we wish to apply the above formalism to the study of the @xmath0-@xmath1 hubbard model in two dimensions whose single particle dispersion is @xmath58 , where we have set the lattice constant @xmath59 .",
    "the superconducting phase diagram of the weak - coupling @xmath0-@xmath1 hubbard model has been studied previously by considering the effective kl interaction @xmath60 with both @xmath61 and @xmath62 lying at the fermi surface.@xcite roughly speaking , such an approach provides us with the coupling constant @xmath63 , but not with the prefactor @xmath64 in the bcs formula for the transition temperature , @xmath65 .    in what follows",

    "( [ eq : variation_en ] ) which represents the standard second - order perturbation theory effects , and treat it as an additive constant . a more detailed study of eq .  ( [ eq : variation_en ] ) taking into account also the last term is postponed to future publications .",
    "moreover , since we expect that @xmath67 , we make use of the @xmath66 fermi functions in the calculation of the particle - hole susceptibility @xmath68 .",
    "a standard bcs calculation leads to the self - consistent equation for the gap function @xmath69 , @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is the chemical potential .",
    "an example of the special set of @xmath74 points in the first brillouin zone for @xmath75 and @xmath76 . under approaching the fermi energy , the grid changes in each level ( there are 4 levels in total ) from @xmath77 to @xmath78.,width=377 ]    for temperatures",

    "the maximal eigenvalue @xmath86 of @xmath87 grows and the mean field transition temperature @xmath88 can be calculated from the condition @xmath89 .",
    "we have studied the eigenvalues of @xmath87 numerically . in order to minimize the cost of the calculation",

    "[ fig : lattice ] .",
    "the lattice consists of a sequence @xmath91 of @xmath92 regular @xmath93 grids , which become progressively more dense as the distance to the fermi level diminishes , @xmath94 .",

    "we construct a sequence of energies @xmath98 with a quotient @xmath99 . for @xmath100 ,",
    "the @xmath101-th level grid @xmath93 is realized for all @xmath61 points satisfying @xmath102 , whereas the @xmath92-th grid applies for @xmath103 .",
    "the lattice is characterized by three parameters : @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and the number of levels @xmath92 . in what follows",
    "we always take @xmath106 and @xmath107 , and instead of the number of levels we describe the lattice by specifying the finest @xmath61-point grid @xmath108 .",
    "the susceptibility @xmath109 was calculated on usual lattices @xmath108 by a straightforward modification of the method described in ref .   which makes use of the fast fourier transform algorithm .",
    "we have used @xmath110 time points and the nyquist frequency was chosen to be @xmath111 .",
    "the matrix @xmath90 was diagonalized by the modified lanczos method.@xcite the initial vector was generated randomly in one octant ( quadrant ) of the brillouin zone and subsequently continued to the whole zone so as to transform according to the one - dimensional @xmath112 , @xmath4 , @xmath113 and @xmath63 ( two - dimensional @xmath114 ) irreducible representations of the point group of the square.@xcite    as an illustrative example , the temperature dependence of the maximal eigenvalue in the @xmath113 sector for @xmath115 and electron density @xmath116 is shown in fig .  [",

    "several points are worth mentioning . for a finite lattice size @xmath117 , the divergence of the particle - particle susceptibility is cut off at temperatures @xmath118 , and therefore @xmath119 saturates at low temperatures @xmath120 .",
    "thus , even making use of a moderate interaction strength@xcite @xmath121 ( this value of @xmath6 is used in most numerical examples ) the largest eigenvalue @xmath86 of @xmath122 is typically less than unity down to the lowest temperatures .",

    "instead , the @xmath85-dependence of the eigenvalue is fitted in the low temperature limit by a bcs - like expression @xmath123 and afterwards @xmath88 is calculated from @xmath65 .",

    "[ fig : lambda_t ] are somewhat special .",
    "let us also stress that the large value of @xmath64 estimated from fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda_t ] should not be interpreted as a large pairing energy scale .",
    "this is evident from an equivalent but physically more meaningful expression @xmath125 which makes explicit use of the pairing energy @xmath126 ( its value is arbitrary , but can be estimated from the maximal temperature where the logarithmic scaling of @xmath86 applies , @xmath127 in our example ) .",
    "the large value of @xmath128 $ ] is a consequence of the large @xmath129 , which in turn measures the contribution of the high energy processes to @xmath86 .",
    "now let us apply the abovementioned method to the study of the superconducting phase diagram of the @xmath0-@xmath1 hubbard model at half filling ( @xmath116 ) . in the strong - coupling limit @xmath8",
