    "the minimum at low temperatures in the resistance of metals with magnetic impurities,@xcite the so - called kondo effect , is related to generic singularities in the many - body perturbation expansion.@xcite many efforts have been put to developing a complete theory of the kondo effect , which would be free from such infinities.@xcite below a typical crossover temperature ( kondo temperature ) there is a many - body screening of the localized magnetic moment by extended electrons with spin.@xcite as a result , a many - body singlet state is formed .",
    "the local moment is shielded or confined and the properties of such a many - body system are well represented by the local fermi liquid picture.@xcite this is a strong - coupling regime . above the kondo temperature the localized magnetic moment is decoupled from the electrons giving a curie contribution to the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "this is a local moment regime .",
    "now , the kondo effect attracts attention elsewhere:@xcite in classical@xcite and quantum phase transitions,@xcite in quantum dots and nanostructures,@xcite in strongly correlated electrons,@xcite and also in quark confinement and asymptotic freedom in hadronic matter.@xcite    traditionally , the kondo effect is studied either within the kondo model,@xcite where the extended electrons and the localized magnetic moment interact via the exchange antiferromagnetic coupling , or within the single impurity anderson model ( siam),@xcite where the extended electrons hybridize with the localized electrons and the latter interact via on - site coulomb - like interaction .    the kondo model and the siam with linear dispersion relations have been solved exactly by the bethe ansatz technique.@xcite this powerful method is not , however , applicable in general cases .",
    "other analytical , asymptotically exact methods , i.e. conformal field theory and bosonization , are also limited to specific dispersion relations .",
    "in many practical cases , e.g. in modeling transport in nanostructures@xcite or in modeling correlated electron systems within the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft),@xcite the kondo model or the siam would have to be solved for arbitrary dispersion relations , exchange interaction , and/or hybridization functions .",
    "this requirement is achieved within numerically exact methods , e.g. in quantum monte carlo ( qmc)@xcite or in numerical renormalization group ( nrg).@xcite the computational cost in time and memory increases , however , very fast at lowest temperatures or in systems with many channels and orbitals .",
    "therefore , all those exact methods are of limited use in modeling real systems .",
    "different analytical , approximate methods have also been developed .",
    "in fact , our understanding of the kondo effect arrived from renormalization group approaches,@xcite where high energy modes are successively removed and low energy couplings are renormalized accordingly .",
    "another class of approximate methods are those based on different perturbation expansions.@xcite they do not reproduce either the exponential kondo energy scale or the local fermi liquid properties at energies below the kondo energy scale .",
    "these drawbacks can be partially cured within sophisticated resummations of feynman diagrams.@xcite    in recent years a local moment approach ( lma ) has been put forward by d.  logan and collaborators.@xcite within this analytical , approximate method applied to the siam one recovers : i ) the exponential kondo energy scale , ii ) low - energy local fermi liquid properties , and iii ) high energy charge fluctuations , correctly .",
    "the lma starts with an unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) perturbation expansion , derived for each direction of the local moment , and afterwards the symmetry restoration is performed.@xcite physically relevant observables are derived from averaging perturbation results over different local moment orientations .",
    "finally , a free parameter , i.e. the length of the local moment , is determined via imposing the local fermi liquid conditions on the ground state . since",
    "the lma has been proved to reproduce several exactly known results and to recover correctly the properties of the siam at all energy scales@xcite it seems to be an excellent method of choice in studying properties of nanosystems@xcite and systems with correlated electrons.@xcite indeed the lma has been used in studying kondo insulators and heavy - fermions,@xcite impurity systems with many orbitals,@xcite and siam in the presence of magnetic field.@xcite    in this paper we generalize the lma of d.  logan",
    "_ et al_.@xcite by using the variational principle in determining the length of the local magnetic moment .",
    "such approach is motivated by the very general principle that the best approximate solution must minimize the ground state ( free ) energy .",
    "it is free from any bias toward the local fermi liquid properties .",
    "therefore , the variational local moment approach ( vlma ) is applicable to any system with a magnetic impurity , not necessarily that being in the local fermi liquid fixed point . in particular ,",
    "vlma can be used in studying kondo effects in multi - orbital and/or multi - channel siam , where local fermi or non - fermi liquid ground states are expected.@xcite it can be extended to finite temperatures , where local fermi liquid properties are only approximately satisfied .",
    "vlma can also be applied to solving the impurity problems inside the dmft and its cluster extensions.@xcite this allows for unbiased studying of metal - insulator transitions in correlated electron systems in various configurations . in this paper",
    "we present a few applications of the vlma .    in the following we define the multi - orbital siam in sec .",
    "ii and next formulate the vlma method in sec .",
    "here we also provide arguments that vlma is a conserving and thermodynamically consistent approximation in the kadanoff - baym sense@xcite . to show the usefulness of this method ,",
    "the vlma is applied to one- and two - orbital siam in sec .",
    "iv and to correlated electron problems within the dmft in sec .",
    "v. final conclusions and outlooks are in sec .",
    "the vlma is developed explicitly for solving a multi - orbital single impurity anderson model , which is defined first .",
    "the hamiltonian of the multi - orbital siam is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 creates an impurity electron with spin @xmath2 and orbital quantum number @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the number operator of impurity electrons , and @xmath5 creates a conduction electron with spin @xmath6 in a band  @xmath7 .",
    "we assume the same number of orbitals ( bands ) for local and conduction electrons .",
    "the hamiltonian contains local interactions @xmath8 between impurity electrons on the same orbital and local interactions @xmath9 between impurity electrons on different orbitals .",
    "the ising part of the exchange interaction @xmath10 is also included .",
    "the single particle energies of conduction electrons @xmath11 and the hybridization between impurity and conduction electrons , represented by matrix elements @xmath12 in , can be combined into a hybridization function @xmath13 .",
    "it is a matrix in orbital space with matrix elements given by @xmath14_{\\alpha\\beta}(i\\omega_n ) \\equiv",

    "starting from the lma of logan _",
    "et al_.,@xcite we formulate its variational version , i.e. the vlma , in order to approximately solve the hamiltonian with arbitrary parameters .",
    "the vlma consists of four steps :    * finding the unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) solution of , * performing a renormalized perturbation expansion around each of the uhf solutions , * restoring the symmetry of the solution , * variationally determining the lengths of local moments and orbital occupancies .",
    "next we discuss each step in detail .",
    "the vlma begins with the uhf solution of the siam in eq .  .",
    "to set the notation and explain basic ideas we first consider the one - orbital case , i.e. @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "then the uhf local green s function @xmath22 ( in the matsubara representation ) is given by@xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 in eq .",
    "and @xmath25 is the average occupation number per spin . by introducing the total average occupancy of the impurity @xmath26 and the local magnetic moment @xmath27",
    "we write the uhf solution in the form @xmath28 with @xmath29 for spin up / down .",
    "the uhf solution depends on the value of the local moment @xmath30 , which has to be determined self - consistently .",
    "it turns out that there exists a critical value @xmath31 such that for @xmath32 the uhf local moment @xmath33.@xcite the sign ( direction along the quantization axis ) of the local moment is either positive or negative .",
    "the choice of one from the two possibilities breaks the symmetry of the solution with respect to the symmetry of the siam .",
    "this distinguishes two broken symmetry solutions , which we label by @xmath34 for @xmath35 and by @xmath36 for @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath38 the dyson equation@xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the inverse of the non - interacting green s function , defines two uhf self - energies @xmath41 .    in the multi - orbital siam with @xmath42",
    "orbitals the uhf solution depends on @xmath43 parameters : @xmath42 local moments @xmath44 and @xmath42 occupancies of the orbitals @xmath45 . in the uhf approximation",
    "the local moments have non - zero values above critical values of the interactions.@xcite similarly to the one - orbital case , the uhf solution with non - zero local moments breaks the symmetry of the hamiltonian . in the case of non - degenerate orbitals and zero magnetic field",
    "the uhf solution is doubly degenerate , i.e. solutions with @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where all signs are opposite , have the same energy .",
    "these two equivalent solutions we denote again with @xmath34 and @xmath36 , respectively",
    ". hence , there are two green s functions @xmath48 , which are now matrices in the orbital space .",
    "the matrix dyson equation @xmath49 defines the two matrix self - energies @xmath50 .",
    "the matrix elements of the self - energies are given by@xcite @xmath51\\equiv \\delta_{\\alpha \\beta } \\tilde{\\sigma}^{a / b}_{\\alpha \\,\\sigma } , \\label{selfenergia_hf1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the length of the total impurity magnetic moment .",
    "the uhf self - energy is diagonal in the orbital index @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , if the hybridization function is diagonal , the uhf propagators are also diagonal in the orbital indices , i.e. @xmath53 only this diagonal case is considered here .      before discussing technical details of the perturbation expansion we first explain the idea of symmetry restoration .",
    "since there are always two equivalent uhf solutions , the higher order in @xmath54 and @xmath55 perturbation expansion around the mean - field solution is not self - evident .",
    "we perform the renormalized perturbation expansion ( rpe ) around each of the uhf solutions and then restore the symmetry . following d. logan,@xcite",
    "we formulate a symmetry restoring ansatz in the multi - orbital case as follows @xmath56 note , that the two rpe local green s functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 are related by @xmath59 .",
    "the result ( [ multi_ansatz ] ) depends on the values of all local moments @xmath60 and , in the general case , also on all local orbital occupancies @xmath61 .",
    "these are parameters of the method , which are not equal to their corresponding uhf values .",
    "these parameters are determined here via the variational principle ( see sec .",
    "iiid ) .",
    "now , we need to find @xmath62",
    ". we note that the symmetry restoration step does not depend on a specific rpe scheme around uhf .",
    "however , it is important to select such an approximation that captures the processes which are essential to the kondo problem .",
    "these are processes with the local spin - flips.@xcite in the multi - orbital case spin - flip processes can occur together with the change of the orbital index .",
    "such an orbital - flip is also possible without spin - flip , however . the second order feynman diagrams describing these processes are depicted in fig .  [ multi_self ] .",
    "the second order contribution to the self - energy is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the bosonic matsubara frequency and @xmath65 the local interaction matrix with elements that have spin and orbital indices and are given by @xmath66 by construction , since @xmath13 is diagonal , the self - energy is also diagonal in orbital and spin indices .",
    "the polarization propagator @xmath67 that contributes to the self - energy in eq .",
    "is given by @xmath68 in the transverse spin channel ( @xmath69 ) , and by @xmath70 in the longitudinal channel ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "feynman diagrams representing these expressions are plotted in fig  [ multi_self ] .",
    "finite order perturbation theory does not reproduce the kondo exponential scale . therefore , following refs .  , we perform the ladder summation of diagrams with spin- and orbital - flip processes to infinite order .",
    "then we obtain the self - energy with a new polarization propagator @xmath72 . the summed series , depicted symbolically in fig .",
    "[ rpa2 ] , leads to a matrix expression for the polarization propagator @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the interaction matrix",
    ". then the self - energy is obtained by inserting the full polarization propagator @xmath72 to the expression , i.e. @xmath75 where we replaced @xmath76 by @xmath72 .",
    "the uhf green s functions @xmath48 have the symmetry @xmath77 this leads to the relations between matrix elements of @xmath78 and @xmath72 , i.e. @xmath79 hence , we have a useful relation between the two self - energies @xmath80 the frequency - dependent self - energies @xmath81 can now be used in the dyson equation to obtain the two propagators @xmath62 .",
    "the full solution is given by the symmetry restoration equation .",
    "the solution is still dependent on the local moments @xmath82 and on the orbital occupancies .",
    "they are determined next .",
    "the values of the local moments are yet unknown parameters .",
    "the physical values are found by the minimization of the ground state energy at zero temperature or the free energy at finite temperatures .",
    "this variational approach is the main difference between the vlma , presented here , and the lma in refs .",
    "[ ] . the general variational approach allows us to use the method for more than one orbital in the degenerate and non - degenerate cases , and also enables us to formulate the method directly at finite temperatures.@xcite    in the siam , the ground state energy is obtained from the one - particle local green s function .",
    "the total ground state energy in the siam has two contributions : @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the energy @xmath83 does not depend on the local moments @xmath82 .",

    "it is important to observe , that the vlma method can be implemented by using functions on real frequency axis .",
    "this gives us a direct access to the local spectral functions @xmath92 without the necessity of performing analytical continuation .",
    "the related calculations are presented in the appendix .    in order to use the vlma at finite temperatures",
    "the free energy has to be minimized instead of the ground state energy .",
    "the calculation of the free energy from one - particle green s function involves integration from zero to one over an auxiliary parameter @xmath93 which multiplies the local interaction @xmath65.@xcite since @xmath93 enters in a nonlinear and indirect way into the expression for the free energy , the vlma at finite temperatures is computationally involved and has not been implemented so far .",
