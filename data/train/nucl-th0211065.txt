    "one of the reasons for a renewed interest in the @xmath0 reaction is the recently measured @xmath5 angular distribution by the cosy - tof collaboration  @xcite at an excess energy , @xmath1 mev .",
    "in addition to the existing total cross section data from saturne  @xcite ( @xmath4 mev ) , the new data can be used to further constrain theoretical models .",
    "we study the @xmath0 reaction considering two different scenarios : with and without the inclusion of nucleon resonance excitations  @xcite .",
    "we use a relativistic hadronic model , where the reaction amplitude is calculated in dwba which includes both the nn initial and final state interactions ( denoted by isi and fsi , respectively ) .",
    "the isi is implemented in the on - shell approximation  @xcite , while fsi is generated using the bonn nn potential  @xcite .",
    "effects of the finite @xmath5 width are also included .",
    "the @xmath6 fsi is accounted for only via the pole diagrams ( s - channel processes ) .",
    "most of the parameter values of the model are fixed from considerations of other reactions closely related to the one in the present study and are given in ref .",
    "for further details of the model we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite . the @xmath5-meson production amplitude and its associated production currents ,",
    "are depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig : amplitude ] and  [ fig : current ] , respectively .",
    "the production currents consist of , a ) nucleonic ( and/or resonance ) current and b ) mesonic current . in section 2 , we discuss the results without the nucleon resonance degrees of freedom , while in section 3 , we present the results with the resonance degrees of freedom .",

    "one of the two free parameters in the nucleonic current , the tensor to vector coupling constant ratio , @xmath8 , at the @xmath9 vertex is determined by fitting the angular distribution data at @xmath1 mev @xcite ; the shape of the angular distribution is found to be quite sensitive to the value of @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "also , the cutoff parameter , @xmath11 , in the form factor at the @xmath9 vertex is adjusted concomitantly to reproduce the total cross section at @xmath1 mev . using the value , @xmath12 , associated with the physical @xmath5 ( not with the virtual @xmath5 exchanged ) ,",
    "we obtain the value of @xmath13 to best reproduce the angular distribution as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : angular1 ] ( left panel ) .",
    "( the value quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite should read @xmath12 . )",
    "the shape of the angular distribution is quite insensitive to the values of @xmath14 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : angular1 ] , where the result in the right panel is obtained by using a value of @xmath15 , which corresponds approximately to the value used in the bonn nn potential  @xcite .",
    "the energy dependence of the total cross section calculated using the values of @xmath13 and @xmath12 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross1 ] together with the result of ref .",
    "@xcite used in the analysis of the saturne data  @xcite .",
    "the present result substantially underestimates the saturne data  @xcite for @xmath4 mev .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is that , as we shall show later , we probably overestimate too much the mesonic current contribution at @xmath1 mev .",
    "this results in substantial underestimation of the cross section at near threshold due to the much more efficient destructive interference between the nucleonic and mesonic current contributions as the excess energy decreases .",
    "although currently there is no definite experimental evidence of a @xmath5-meson coupling to a nucleon resonance , it would be natural to expect some resonance current contributions , especially , at nucleon incident energies involved in the production of @xmath5 in nn collisions .",
    "the reduction of the mesonic current at high excess energies may then be compensated by the nucleon resonance current contribution .",
    "we discuss such a scenario next .",
    "[ fig : angular1 ]    [ fig : cross1 ]",
    "we now include nucleon resonance degrees of freedom ( resonance current ) in the model .",
    "the criteria for selecting relevant resonances are : ( i ) those appreciably decay to @xmath16 to use the vector meson dominance assumption to produce the @xmath5 , ( ii ) those mass distributions are around @xmath17 , to be able to maximally contribute near threshold , ( iii ) select a minimum number of resonances to avoid introducing many new parameters , ( iv ) those that can describe consistently the @xmath2 reaction . as a result , we have selected resonances @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    in fig .  [",
    "fig : pin ] we show the calculated energy dependence of the total cross section for @xmath2 .",
    "we note that at the excess energy of @xmath1 mev in @xmath0 , the center - of - mass energy of the subsystem @xmath2 will reach a maximum value of @xmath20 gev . at lower @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath19 contributions are dominant , but not @xmath23 nor @xmath24 . also , without the inclusion of the resonances",
    ", it is very difficult to reproduce the near - threshold behavior of the @xmath2 total cross section within a reasonable set of parameters . with the inclusion of the resonances ,",
    "we need somewhat stronger form factor for the @xmath25 vertex .",
    "in particular , the part of the form factor which account for the off - shellness of the @xmath26 meson is of dipole form with the cutoff parameter @xmath27 mev  @xcite .",
    "a cutoff parameter value of @xmath28 gev was also determined at the @xmath9 vertex .",
    "in addition , because @xmath24 has an appreciable decay branch to @xmath29 , we simulated this by a @xmath30-meson , where the value for @xmath31 is adjusted to reproduce the @xmath3 total cross section data at @xmath1 mev .",
    "thus , the contribution from @xmath24 should be regarded also as taking into account the other possible resonance contributions not included explicitly in our model .",
    "we obtained a value of @xmath32 ; results for another possible value , @xmath33 , are not shown , because the calculated energy dependence of the total cross section is worse , although the angular distribution is better described at @xmath1 mev . here",
    ", the value of @xmath10 was set to be @xmath34 , more in line with the estimates from other studies . with the value of @xmath13 obtained in the previous it would be very difficult to describe consistently the nn scattering data  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross2 ] we show the calculated energy dependence of the total cross section for @xmath3 .",
    "the result is greatly improved compared to that without the inclusion of any resonances in the previous section .",
    "however , it still underestimates the saturne data  @xcite ( @xmath4 mev ) by about a factor of two .",
    "[ fig : resonance ] shows the decomposition of the resonance contribution . at near threshold",
    "the dominant contribution comes from @xmath22 , while at higher excess energy , the dominant contribution comes from @xmath24 , which was negligible in @xmath2 .",
    "if we want to be consistent with both the @xmath2 and @xmath0 reactions , it seems necessary to include at least @xmath35 and @xmath19 resonances in the present approach .",
    "[ fig : pin ]    [ fig : angular2 ]    [ fig : cross2 ]    [ fig : resonance ]",
    "we have reported our results for the @xmath0 reaction studied by considering two different scenarios : with and without the inclusion of nucleon resonance excitations .",
    "the results show that the energy dependence of the total cross section @xmath36 mev is apparently better described by the inclusion of resonance excitations , which is also consistent with the @xmath2 reaction .",
    "however , it still underestimates the data in the @xmath4 mev region by about a factor of two , and remains a problem in understanding the reaction mechanism .",
