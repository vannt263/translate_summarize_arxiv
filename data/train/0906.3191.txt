    "intervening metal absorption lines have routinely been observed along the line of sight to quasars ( qsos ) . among these features ,",
    "strong mgii @xmath82796 , @xmath82803 absorption doublets ( with equivalent width @xmath11  ) represent good indicators of metal - enriched gas associated with foreground galaxies .",
    "this is because magnesium is an @xmath12 element produced by red giants and dispersed in the interstellar medium ( ism ) by supernovae and stellar winds ( bergeron & boisse 1991 , steidel et al .",
    "in particular , such a strong doublet on a qso sightline witnesses the presence of @xmath13 galaxies within 60 kpc projected distance and with different morphological types ( churchill et al .",
    "2005 , kacprzak et al .",
    "in addition , the @xmath14 @xmath15 mgii intervening absorbers are hosted within dark matter halos with characteristic masses of @xmath16 ( bouche et al . 2006 ) and @xmath17 are associated with damped lyman - alpha systems ( dlas , rao et al .",
    "2006 ) .    for a few hours after their onset , gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows are the brightest beacons in the far universe",
    ": therefore they provide an alternative and complementary way to qsos to fully explore the properties of high - z galaxies in which they are hosted ( see savaglio 2006 ; prochaska et al .",
    "2007 ) and of those along their sightlines . in principle , the sightlines of qsos and grbs are expected to be equivalent .",
    "prochter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found @xmath18 strong ( @xmath19 ) mgii intervening absorbers in @xmath20 qso spectra from the sdss dr4 , which corresponds to a redshift number density of @xmath21 .",
    "surprisingly , the same authors report the identification of 14 mgii systems along 14 grb sightlines , which translates into a redshift number density of @xmath22 ( 99% confidence interval ) , almost 4 times higher than the qso one .",
    "on the other hand , the intervening civ absorbers for the two classes of sources do not show any statistical difference ( sudilovsky et al .",
    "2007 , tejos et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is still uncertain , and several scenarios have been widely discussed ( see e.g. porciani et al .",
    "2007 and cucchiara et al . 2009 ) .",
    "one of these interpretations requires a different size of the source , namely , that qso emitting regions are larger than grbs which in turn are comparable to the typical size of the mgii clouds ( frank et al .",
    "2007 ) . in this scenario variability in the column densities of the mgii absorber",
    "is expected , since the lorentz factor decreases because the fireball decelerates on the interstellar medium , and thus the grb emission regions increase .",
    "a mgii variability in multi - epoch spectroscopy data on grb060206 was first claimed by the analysis by hao et al .",

    "occasionally , extremely bright optical transient emission is associated with the grb event , offering the superb opportunity to take spectra of the afterglows with high resolution instruments . in a fraction of these cases , multi - epoch , high resolution spectroscopy with an adequate signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) can be obtained , allowing to make detailed studies of the host galaxy ism and to put strong constraints on its physical parameters ( see vreeswijk et al .",
    "2007 for grb060418 , and delia et al .",
    "2009a for grb080319b ) . here",
    "we take advantage of the high quality data collected for grb083019b to make a systematic study of this grb sightline and to search for variability of the mgii intervening absorbers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section @xmath23 presents a short summary of the grb080319b detection and observations ; section @xmath24 describes the datasets and data reduction ; section @xmath25 presents the full analysis of the intervening systems identified in the spectra ; finally in section @xmath26 the results are discussed and conclusions are drawn .",
    "grb080319b was discovered by the burst alert telescope ( bat ) instrument on board swift on 2008 , march 19 , at 06:12:49 ut .",
    "swift slewed to the target in less than 1 minute and a bright afterglow was found by both the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) and uv - optical telescope ( uvot ) at ra = @xmath27h @xmath28 m @xmath29s , dec = + 36@xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 ( racusin et al .",
    "2008a ) with observations starting 60.5 and 175 s after the trigger , respectively .",
    "the field of grb080319b was imaged by the `` pi of the sky '' apparatus located at las campanas observatory before , during and after the grb event ( cwiok et al .",
    "the field was also targetted by the robotic telescope rem just 43 s after the bat trigger ( covino et al .",
    "2008a , b ) . the tortora wide - field optical camera ( 12 cm diameter , 20@xmath3325 deg fov , tv - ccd , unfiltered ) mounted on rem also imaged the field before , during and after the grb event with good temporal resolution ( karpov et al .",
    "these observations show that the grb reached the magnitudes @xmath34 about @xmath35 s and @xmath36 about @xmath37 s after the trigger .",

    "in this paper we present high resolution ( r=40000 , corresponding to 7.5 km / s ) spectroscopy of the optical afterglow of the `` naked - eye '' gamma ray burst grb080319b ( @xmath2 ) , observed by uves at the vlt in three different epochs , starting @xmath39 minutes , @xmath40 and @xmath41 hours after the trigger , respectively .",
    "we concentrate here on the intervening absorbers along the grb sightline , since the absorption features in the vicinity of the afterglow have already been studied and presented in delia et al .",
    "( 2009a ) .",
    "our spectral coverage allows to analyze a redshift path for the mgii @xmath82796 in the range @xmath42 .",
    "we are sensitive to lines with ew down to @xmath43 ( at the @xmath44 confidence level ) , thanks to the extremely high s / n of the first rrm observation .",
    "at least four intervening systems between z = 0.8 and z = 0.5 have been identified .",
    "most of them show a complex structure constituted by several components , similar to that of the intervening absorbers along the qso sightlines ( churchill & vogt 2001 ) .",
    "all systems feature the mgii @xmath82796 , @xmath82803 doublet .",
    "feii , mgi and mnii lines are detected in four , two and one systems , respectively .",
    "prochter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) claimed that the incidence of strong mgii absorbers along grb sight lines is nearly four times higher than that along the line of sight to qsos .",
    "they analyzed the spectra of 14 grb optical afterglows , finding on average one intervening system per afterglow with equivalent width @xmath45  .",
    "the grb080319b sightline confirms this trend , since the rest frame ew of the mgii @xmath82796 absorption line is @xmath45@xmath15 in one system .",
    "structured intervening systems are expected if the discrepancy between qsos and grbs intervening absorbers is due to a different size of the source , namely , if qso emitting regions are larger than grbs which in turn are comparable to the typical size of themgii clouds ( frank et al .",
    "according to their estimation , the qso beam size must be larger than 3 @xmath33 10@xmath46 cm while for the grb beam they suggest a size around a few @xmath33 10@xmath47 cm . to observe this effect ,",
    "the mgii absorber should then be patchy with a clump size around 10@xmath46 cm .",
    "nevertheless , in this scenario , variability in the column densities of the mgii absorbers along the grb sightlines is expected .",
    "mgii variability in multi - epoch spectroscopy data on grb060206 was first claimed by the analysis by hao et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , but then disproved by aoki et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and thne et al .",
    "this work confirms the lack of variability in the column densities of the grb intervening absorbers , in the specific case of grb080319b . in particular",
    ", the ew of the mgii @xmath82796 absorption line is consistent within @xmath44 in the three uves observations .",
    "given the s / n ratio of our data , we can conclude that a variability of this feature , if present , is less than 10% at the @xmath48 confidence level .",
    "this upper limit is three times smaller than the ones that can be estimated for grb060206 using the data by aoki et al .",
    "racusin et al .",
    "( 2008b ) modeled the radiation of grb080319b as coming from a structured jet constituted by an inner , narrow jet ( @xmath49 ) and an outer , wider jet ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "they interpreted the optical emission at @xmath51s ( @xmath52 being the burst detection time ) as produced by the reverse shock of the inner jet , while that at @xmath53 as the signature of the forward shock of the outer jet .",
    "since the first uves observation starts at @xmath54 while the second and the third ones start more than @xmath55hr later , a strong increase in the size of the emitting region is expected from this scenario . in more detail ,",
    "the dimension of the emitting region is @xmath56 cm at the beginning of the grb event and @xmath57 cm a few hours later ( pandey et al .",
    "2009 , racusin et al . 2008b and kumar & panaitescu 2008 ) .",
    "although we can not be more quantitative , a variation of a factor of ten in the dimension of the emitting region would imply a considerable reduction of the intervening column densities , but it is not detected .",
    "indeed , time resolved , high resolution spectroscopy allows us for the first time to exclude a significant ( @xmath58 ) variability even by considering the single components of each intervening system alone .",
    "porciani et al .",
    "( 2007 ) investigated several possible explanations for the strong mgii excess , namely , dust obscuration bias , clustering of the absorbers , different beam sizes of the sources , multiband magnification bias of grbs , association of the absorbers with the grb event or with the circumburst environment .",
    "they concluded that none of these effects alone can explain the observed difference , but maybe the combination of two or more of them can reduce the significance of the discrepancy .",
    "we can take advantage of the dimensions of the emitting source in grb080319b and the lack of variability in the intervening absorbers to characterize the absorbers along this grb sightline .",
    "since these dimensions are in the range @xmath59 cm , the mgii ( and other species ) clouds can not have clumps or structures smaller than @xmath60 pc , otherwise we should observe variability in their absorption .",
    "this is not obvious , since ding et al .",
    "( 2003 ) show that smaller intervening absorbers are present along the line of sight to qsos .",
    "cucchiara et al .",
    "( 2009 ) compared 81 qsos and 6 grb lines of sight obtained with uves .",
    "they found no significant evidence to support a difference between the two absorber populations , concluding that a possible explanation for the mgii excess could be intrinsic to the grb environment . a similarity between the narrow lines of the grb intervening absorbers and that produced by the material ejected in the accretion disk winds of qsos has been pointed out",
    "nevertheless , the high velocities required by the intervening redshifts ( @xmath61 ) and the lack of fine structure features in these systems represent a strong weakness of this picture .",
    "in addition , tejos et al .",
    "( 2009 ) recently found no evidence for a similar excess considering the weak ( @xmath62 ) mgii systems along the line of sight of 8 grb observed with echelle spectrographs . these authors tend to exclude an intrinsic nature of the discrepancy , since it would result in an excess in the weak systems too",
    "they suggest that the best explanation available at present could be gravitational lensing bias due to lensing by the host galaxy of the absorber .",
    "indeed the strong mgii system along the grb080319b sightline has a velocity of @xmath63 km / s with respect to the grb .",
    "the data do not show evidence either of broad profiles and/or partial coverage ( see e.g. dodorico et al .",
    "2004 ) , so this absorber is likely an intervening system .    combining the data by prochter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) with the results from the analysis in this paper and that in delia et al .",
    "( 2009b ) regarding the line of sight to grb080330 , we obtain 16 strong ( ew@xmath45 ) mgii intervening absorbers along 16 grb sightlines .",
    "the total redshift path becomes @xmath64 , and this results in a @xmath65 .",
    "this surprising excess of strong mgii absorbers with respect to qso sightlines remains a matter of debate and a satisfactory explanation is still missing . clearly more observations and",
    "analysis are needed in order to solve this issue .",
