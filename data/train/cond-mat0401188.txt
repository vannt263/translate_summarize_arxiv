    "brownian rectifiers or ratchets are devices that convert nonequilibrium fluctuations into useful work in the presence of load .",
    "several physical models  @xcite have been proposed to understand the nature of currents and their possible reversals with applications in nanoparticle separation devices  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of enhancement of efficiency with which these brownian rectifiers convert the nonequilibrium fluctuations into useful work has generated much interest in this field .",
    "this , in turn , has led to the emergence of a separate subfield - stochastic energetics - on its own right  @xcite . using this formalism one can readily establish the compatibility between langevin or fokker - planck formalism with the laws of thermodymanics thereby providing a tool to study systems far from equilibrium . with this framework",
    "one can calculate various physical quantities such as efficiency of energy transduction @xcite , energy dissipation ( hysteresis loss ) , entropy ( entropy production )  @xcite , etc .",
    "most of the studies yield low efficiencies , in the subpercentage range , in various types of ratchets .",
    "this is due to intrinsic irreversibility associated with ratchet operation . only fine tuning of parameters can lead to a large efficiency , the regime of parameters , however , being very narrow  @xcite .",
    "recently makhnovskii et al .",
    "@xcite constructed a special type of flashing ratchet with two asymmetric double - well periodic - potential- states displaced by half a period .",
    "such flashing ratchet models were found to be highly efficient with efficiency an order of magnitude higher than in earlier models  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea behind this enhanced efficiency is that even for diffusive brownian motion the choice of appropriate potential profile ensures suppression of backward motion and hence reduction in the accompanying dissipation .    in the present work",
    ", we study the motion of a particle in a rocking ratchet rocked purposefully as to favour current in one direction but to suppress motion in the opposite direction .",
    "this is in similar spirit as in case of flashing ratchets proposed by makhnovskii et al .",
    "this is accomplished by applying temporally asymmetric but unbiased periodic forcings  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , such choice of forcings helps in obtaining rectified currents with high efficiency even for spatially symmetric periodic potentials .",
    "still higher efficiency is obtained with asymmetric potentials .",
    "the range of parameters of operation of such ratchets is quite wide sustaining large loads .",
    "in addition , frictional inhomogeneity may further enhance the efficiency .",
    "we also see multiple current reversals in the full parameter space of operation even in the adiabatic regime .",
    "however , multiple current reversals require fine tuning of the parameters .",

    "we assume that @xmath9 changes slow enough , i.e. , its frequency is smaller than any other frequency related to the relaxation rate in the problem such that the system is in a steady state at each instant of time .",
    "we consider time asymmetric ratchets with a zero mean periodic driving force @xcite given by @xmath19    here , the parameter @xmath20 signifies the temporal asymmetry in the periodic forcing . for",
    "this forcing in the adiabatic limit the time averaged current is given by  @xcite @xmath21 $ ] which is equal to @xmath22 with @xmath23 the input energy @xmath24 per unit time is given by  @xcite @xmath25.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to calculate efficiency a load @xmath26 is applied against the direction of current with overall potential given by @xmath27 .",
    "the current flows against the load as long as the load is less than the stopping force @xmath28 beyond which the current is in the same direction as that of the load .",
    "thus in the operating range of the load @xmath29 the brownian particles move in the direction opposite to the load thereby storing energy . the average work done over a period",

    "all the physical quantities are taken in dimensionless units . in the following section",

    "inset shows the current in the presence of lone asymmetry parameters ( @xmath48).,width=268,height=182 ]    we plot efficiency as a function of load in the presence of temporal asymmetry @xmath20 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 . for a given @xmath20",
    "the efficiency slowly increases with load , attains a maximum and then decreases rapidly .",
    "the locus of peak values corresponding to different @xmath20 values ( with appropriate load @xmath26 ) is found to have a nonmonotonous behaviour with the maximum ( @xmath51 ) being at around @xmath52 corresponding to a load of @xmath53 .",
    "for this value of @xmath20 there is a large external driving force field , i.e. , @xmath54 for a time duration @xmath55 , in one direction which causes considerable reduction in the barrier height in that direction .",
    "this makes the particle cross the potential barrier easily and slide down the slope before the field changes . during the other part of the period of @xmath9 @xmath56 which lasts for @xmath57",
    "the potential barrier for reverse motion remains large thus nullifying the chances of reverse motion .",
    "there is an optimum value of @xmath20 ( @xmath58 , for the given parameters ) , however , for which considerable current is obtained . beyond this value of @xmath20",
    "the duration for which the force remains large is so small that eventhough the barriers may be negligible or vanishing altogether , the particle may not have enough opportunity to move away before the force gets changed .",
    "this is the reason why the rectifier works most efficiently for an optimum value of @xmath20 . for finite",
    "@xmath20 current against the load is obtained for load @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath28 represents the range of load for which useful work is performed and is an increasing function of @xmath20 .",
    "the useful work so obtained @xmath60 and the input energy @xmath24 are shown in fig .",
    "[ inoute8 ] for a representative value of @xmath20 as a function of load .",
    "the input energy decreases to a minimum value for a load larger than @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , it remains positive , as expected , over the entire range .",
    "the output energy shows a peak with load in the region where the input energy is monotonously decreasing .",
    "it then becomes negative for @xmath61 as anticipated .",
    "the qualitative behaviours of efficiency and energies shown in figs .",
    "[ eff_leps ] and [ inoute8 ] are similar to those in reference  @xcite for the flashing ratchet .    in fig .",
    "[ eff_lem ] we consider the periodic potential @xmath62 to be spatially asymmetric together with a temporally asymmetric external driving force field .",
    "the potential asymmetry enhances the efficiency of energy transduction as well as widens the range of load .",
    "this is due to the fact that for @xmath63 the presence of asymmetric parameter @xmath64 further reduces the potential barrier for forward motion and enhances the barrier for backward motion .",
    "moreover , as can be seen from the inset , one can get finite current even when @xmath34 with finite stopping force @xmath28 in contrast to the symmetric potential case . from figs .",
    "[ eff_leps ] and [ eff_lem ] it is clear that the temporally asymmetric forces not only enhance the efficiency of energy transduction but also widen the operation range of load against which the ratchet system works . in fig .",
    "[ eff_t ] we plot efficiency as a function of @xmath65 for various @xmath20 values in the presence of potential asymmetry ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the efficiency decreases with temperature .",
    "the relevant physical parameters chosen for optimal efficiency are mentioned in the caption . from the inset it is to be noted that the current peaks as a function of temperature yet efficiency decreases monotonically .",
    "this implies that thermal fluctuation do not favour energy transduction in this case .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for given temperature and @xmath20 the efficiency shows peaking behaviour as a function of @xmath12 ; the efficiency being zero for @xmath67 as well as for large @xmath12 for in these limits output current vanishes in the absence of load .",
    "next , we present the effect of frictional inhomogeneity ( @xmath68 ) . in fig .",
    "[ eff_phi ] we plot the efficiency as a function of the phase difference between the potential and the friction coefficient @xmath69 for a typical case .",
    "we observe that the inclusion of this parameter @xmath70 further increases the efficiency in a range of @xmath8 depending on other parameter values .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for inhomogeneous systems the efficiency peaks with temperature in a limited range of parameters . with frictional inhomogeneity the range of temperature in which one can obtain output current with finite efficiency",
    "is extended to a large temperature where contribution of @xmath70 dominates over other parameters . in fig  [ currev2 ]",
    "we show that by properly choosing the parameters we can obtain multiple current reversals as a function of temperature . it should be noted that such reversals are not possible in the homogeneous case in the adiabatic regime  @xcite .",
    "the inset shows current as a function of individual parameters ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the plots indicate that individual parameters can not bring about current reversals separately .",
    "however , the possibility of current reversals arises due to the combined effect of the three asymmetry parameters considered .",
    "we have also observed more number of current reversals than shown in fig .",
    "[ currev2 ] by fine tuning the parameters .",
    "we find large efficiency for rocking ratchets driven by temporally asymmetric periodic field the origin of which can be traced to the suppression of backward motion .",
    "the observed efficiency is much higher than the earlier reported values eventhough the ratchet operates in an intrinsically irreversible domain .",
    "this asymmetry factor has also helped in increasing the range of load of operation of the ratchet .",
    "we also observe multiple current reversals in the adiabatic limit by proper fine tuning of different parameters .",
    "these reversals are attributed to inherent complex dynamics of the system .",
