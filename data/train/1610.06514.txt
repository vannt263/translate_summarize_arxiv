    "then as @xmath17 we have @xmath23    note that when @xmath18 and @xmath2 is closed , this is a slight improvement of przytycki s bound of @xmath24 .",
    "( for larger @xmath1 , though , the improvement is significant . )",
    "the best known constructions of @xmath25-systems show that @xmath26 grows at least quadratically in @xmath19 .",
    "thus it is of course natural to ask whether there exists an @xmath27",
    "so that @xmath28 . indeed , one might expect in general that @xmath29 , but currently this is out of reach .",
    "the proof of theorem [ k - system bound ] , which appears in  [ proof of main thm ] , is short enough that there is no need for a detailed summary here .",
    "nonetheless , we point out three main components .",
    "the first is ( a trivial adaptation of ) an argument of aougab  souto ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.2 ) , in which a circle packing argument is used to find a hyperbolic structure on which a given @xmath1-system can be realized length - efficiently .",
    "the other components are theorems [ improve k - thm ] and [ linear growth ] below , which we consider of independent interest .",
    "we should highlight that this argument uses przytycki s bound @xmath30 essentially , in the proof of theorem [ improve k - thm ] .",
    "it turns out that we can exploit his bounds even more effectively when the number of punctures is large in comparison to the genus . here , the proof is inductive , where we relate @xmath31 to @xmath32 by projecting a @xmath1-system on @xmath33 to one on @xmath34 by filling in the puncture .",
    "we note that malestein - rivin - theran ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.2 ) used a similar inductive argument in the @xmath18 case to show that @xmath35    [ 2-system bound ] there is a constant @xmath36 such that @xmath37 and in fact , for @xmath11 we have @xmath38    when @xmath1 is even , przytycki s construction ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 4.1 ) of large @xmath1-systems of arcs can be tweaked in a straightforward manner to produce the lower bound @xmath39 for @xmath16 .",
    "so ,    when @xmath7 is fixed and @xmath40 , we have @xmath41      let @xmath42 denote the _ intersection graph _ of a curve system @xmath43 , whose vertices are in 1 - 1 correspondence with the curves in @xmath43 , and where two vertices are connected by an edge exactly when the corresponding curves intersect essentially on the surface @xmath2 .    in @xcite ,",
    "przytycki s estimate for @xmath44 is a corollary of his estimate for @xmath45 .",
    "the idea is as follows , say when @xmath18 . if @xmath43 is a @xmath25-system , cut @xmath2 open along a curve @xmath46 .",
    "any curve in @xmath43 intersecting @xmath47 becomes an arc on the new surface @xmath48 .",
    "the number of homotopy classes of such arcs is bounded above by @xmath49 , and at most two curves in @xmath43 correspond to the same homotopy class of arc on @xmath48 .",
    "it follows that the degree of @xmath47 in @xmath42 is at most @xmath50 .",
    "to finish , note that the total number of vertices in @xmath42 is at most the sums of the degrees of the vertices in a maximal independent subset of @xmath51 , and any independent set ( i.e.   a set of disjoint simple closed curves on @xmath2 ) has size at most linear in @xmath22 .    to prove theorem [ k - system bound ] in the closed case , we will need the following sharper upper bound for the degree of a vertex in the intersection graph of a @xmath1-system .",

    "when @xmath18 , this bound agrees with the bound @xmath53 one gets with przytycki s argument above and . in general , though , his argument gives @xmath54 , so theorem [ improve k - thm ] is quite a bit stronger",
    ". the improvement arises by adopting a slightly different perspective . instead of cutting open @xmath2 along a curve to produce an arc system on a surface of smaller complexity , one can introduce punctures to @xmath2 and ` slide ' curves to arcs to arrive at an arc system on a surface @xmath48 of slightly larger complexity , and then apply przytycki s bounds for @xmath55 .      fix a hyperbolic structure @xmath56 on @xmath2 , and let @xmath57 be the number of primitive closed geodesics on @xmath56 with length at most @xmath6 .",

    "to prove theorem [ linear growth ] , we first use a geometric interpretation of jrgensen s inequality , due to gilman  @xcite , to say that geodesics of length at most @xmath6 can not get too close in the unit tangent bundle @xmath64 .",
    "small neighborhoods of these geodesics must then be disjoint , and theorem [ linear growth ] follows since the sum of their volumes is less than the total volume of @xmath64 , which is @xmath65 .",
    "[ sec : linear ] .    while theorem [ linear growth ] is certainly not sharp , it is not so far from optimal .",
    "namely , one can show that there is a constant @xmath66 such that @xmath2 supports a hyperbolic structure @xmath56 with @xmath67 in fact , one can realize this lower bound using _",
    "simple _ closed curves .",
    "the point is that in the chosen hyperbolic structure @xmath56 , many curves are pinched : a large number of simple closed curves with controlled lengths can be obtained by twisting around the pinched curves .",
    "see proposition [ short curves ] in  [ sec : linear ] .    in our application",
    ", what is essential is that the upper bound above is at most @xmath68 for some constant @xmath69 , but it would be interesting to see how much the gap between theorem [ linear growth ] and could be narrowed .",
    "it seems likely that an upper bound on the order of @xmath70 could be given for the number of _ simple _ closed curves of length at most @xmath6 , using the collar lemma @xcite in place of jrgensen s inequality . and",
    "when the genus of @xmath2 is linear in @xmath19 , e.g.  when @xmath2 is closed , the lower bound can be improved to @xmath71 , again with simple curves ( see remark [ one - holed tori ] ) .",
    "we fix a hyperbolic surface @xmath56 in what follows , and indicate the unit tangent bundle of @xmath56 by @xmath64 .",

    "[ one - holed tori ] the above construction in one - holed tori subsurfaces would produce @xmath114 curves of length at most @xmath6 , with the difference attributable to the fact that one can build curves that only cross the long annulus once . on the other hand ,",

    "this is complicated by the fact that the tubular neighborhoods @xmath115 will not suffice for an improved bound , and a more careful construction of neighborhoods is required that use more of the embedded annuli whose presence is guaranteed by the collar lemma .",

    "since @xmath143 was the _ first _ intersection point along @xmath47 from @xmath139 , the arc @xmath142 can be perturbed to be simple .",
    "( unperturbed , it tracks @xmath147 twice . )",
    "we claim that when @xmath148 , we have @xmath149 .",
    "suppose that with respect to the order above , @xmath47 intersects @xmath150 before it intersects @xmath151 .",
    "then no new intersections with @xmath151 are created when @xmath72 is replaced by @xmath142 .",
    "moreover , when pushing @xmath151 along @xmath47 to create @xmath152 , one may encounter at most @xmath153 strands of @xmath154 .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath155 and that the first intersection point between @xmath72 and @xmath47 has been pushed all the way to @xmath139 in the construction of @xmath154 , leaving at most @xmath153 strands .",
    "each such strand will contribute to two intersection points between @xmath154 and @xmath156 , and as @xmath157 both belong to a @xmath1-system , we had @xmath158 to begin with .",

    "so , let @xmath43 be a @xmath1-system on @xmath33 . fix a minimal position realization of @xmath43 , and choose arbitrarily a puncture @xmath167 of @xmath33",
    "project each curve in @xmath43 to a curve on @xmath34 by filling in the puncture @xmath167 .",
    "we first bound the number of curves that have inessential projection to @xmath168 .",
    "each such curve @xmath169 bounds a twice - punctured disk , where one of the punctures is @xmath167 .",
    "in other words , @xmath169 is the boundary of a regular neighborhood of an arc @xmath170 from @xmath167 to some other puncture . if @xmath171 both have inessential projections , then @xmath172 , where @xmath173 or @xmath174 , depending on whether @xmath171 share the same second puncture or not .",
    "in particular , @xmath175 , so the set of all @xmath170 is a @xmath176-system of arcs .",
    "therefore , the number of curves @xmath169 with inessential projection is bounded above by @xmath177      we would like to relate @xmath179 to @xmath180 by saying that the projection of @xmath43 to @xmath34 is a @xmath1-system .",
    "the problem is that curves can become homotopic after projection , so the size of the new @xmath1-system can be smaller .",
    "let @xmath181 be a maximal subset of ` good ' curves whose projections are not homotopic , and let @xmath182 be the complementary set of ` bad ' curves . as @xmath183 , it suffices to prove @xmath184    let @xmath185 be a bad curve .",
    "there is then a unique good curve @xmath186 such that the projections of @xmath169 and @xmath186 to @xmath34 are homotopic .",

    "the argument is the same when @xmath169 is of type ( 1 ) but @xmath195 is of type ( 2 ) , with the minor complication that there is one new possibility in figure [ annulus2 ] .",
    "note that it is still obvious that the pictured representative for @xmath201 satisfies @xmath203 .",
    "finally , suppose both @xmath169 and @xmath195 are of type ( 2 ) .",
    "the component of @xmath196 containing @xmath167 is either as in figures [ bigon1 ] or [ bigon2 ] , or ( after homotoping @xmath194 if necessary , leaving it in minimal position with @xmath187 ) it is as in figure [ bigon3 ] .",
    "the worst of these cases is figure [ bigon2 ] , where we see that @xmath204 .                        when @xmath205 , note the useful fact that whenever two curves @xmath206 have homotopic projections in @xmath34 , we must have that @xmath207 are disjoint : if not , there are subarcs @xmath208 of @xmath207 that bound a once - punctured bigon in @xmath209 , punctured by @xmath167 .",
