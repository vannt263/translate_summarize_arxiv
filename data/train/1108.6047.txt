    "ultracold atoms in optical lattices are an ideal testing ground for models in solid - state physics due to the large degree of control over external and internal parameters of these many - body systems @xcite . on the one hand , these systems are very promising as analog quantum simulators for gaining a further understanding of complicated solid state systems @xcite , whereas , on the other hand , completely new models ( e.g. , with further internal degrees of freedom , different quantum statistics , etc . ) can be realized in a very clean and controlled fashion .",
    "specifically , a large focus has been on ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices , which are well described by the bose - hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the first milestone was the experimental observation of the superfluid - mott insulator transition @xcite . with the ever increasing precision in recent experiments @xcite , as well as the development of new probing techniques and remarkable technical advances @xcite , it has become possible to observe effects beyond the standard hubbard model .",
    "specifically , a density dependence of the interaction parameter @xmath0 has been observed by using quantum phase revival spectroscopy @xcite , which has been predicted and described using effective many - body interactions .",
    "a recent experiment using multiband spectroscopy to investigate the effect of bosons in a bose - fermi mixture found a significant reduction of the fermionic tunneling energy @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "while the fock space spanned by the fock states generated by the full multiband single - particle wannier orbitals is a perfectly valid basis for the interacting many - body system , where , by construction , the parameters are density - independent @xcite , it is customary to work in an effective single - band basis .",
    "however , such a description requires a density dependence of the parameters , or , alternatively , the introduction of effective higher - order terms , as will be shown .    it has been proposed @xcite that the density dependence of the bosonic tunneling parameter induced by the bose - fermi interaction can explain the shift in the bosonic superfluid - mott insulator transition observed in bose - fermi mixtures @xcite .",
    "this topic is still under debate , with an alternative cause suggested to be the heating of the system as the lattice is ramped up @xcite .",
    "furthermore , several new phases have recently been predicted for the effective single - band density - dependent bose - hubbard model @xcite . an effective density - dependent change of the hubbard parameters has been calculated using a mean - field decoupling of the densities in bose - fermi mixtures @xcite and also beyond this approximation @xcite , where two - particle hopping amplitudes and further relevant bose - fermi hubbard parameters were calculated within the full multi - orbital picture . in a single species bosonic lattice gas , the density - dependence of @xmath1 and the on - site interactions @xmath0 were calculated by minimizing the energy with respect to the real - space wannier orbitals within a mean - field approach @xcite .",
    "these , as well as nearest - neighbor interactions , were also determined within a gaussian approximation for the wannier functions @xcite .",
    "the density - dependence of the single - particle tunneling amplitude @xmath1 and the interaction parameter @xmath0 , as well as the effect on the phase diagram were considered in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a fully correlated , multi - orbital calculation was performed in the wannier basis to quantitatively determine the density - dependence of @xmath1 . using a set of orthogonal variational orbitals and minimizing the energy with respect to their real - space shape and occupation number , the superfluid - mott insulator transition in an interacting one - dimensional ( 1d ) gas in an optical lattice was determined in @xcite . in the noninteracting wannier or bloch basis , this multi - orbital mean - field approach thus intrinsically contains higher band contributions .    in this work ,",
    "we rigorously derive and define the effective lowest - band representation used in these previous works , where the localized many - body low - energy states are _ dressed _ with contributions from higher bands , analogous to the dressed state basis in quantum optics .",
    "we define new ladder operators connecting only states within this dressed low - energy manifold , which exactly fulfill bosonic commutation relations . for finite interaction strength @xmath2 , these",
    "do not coincide with the usual single - particle wannier creation and annihilation operators and we give the exact prescription for transforming operators between the multi - orbital wannier and the dressed single - band basis in the low - energy description .",
    "this transformation is also vital to translate any operator into the new basis , which is usually given in the real - space , bloch or wannier representation , e.g. , observables , additional terms in the hamiltonian , or perturbations . on a local level",
    ", our transformation recovers the effective multibody interactions found in @xcite in the limit of strong lattice depths @xmath3 , where a gaussian approximation for the wannier functions applies .",
    "furthermore , our basis transformation procedure allows for a systematic treatment of all nonlocal terms .",
    "these have been addressed in the context of bose - fermi mixtures in @xcite and identify the counterparts of local multibody interactions : multi - particle - induced tunneling and correlated - pair tunneling terms arising from the usual bosonic interacting lattice hamiltonian .",

    "( [ sec : low_e_subspace ] ) and ( [ sec : basis_transformation ] ) we define the low - energy subspace and the new effective bosonic ladder operators , from which the transformation properties are derived .",
    "subsequently , they are applied in the systematic derivation of additional terms to the standard bose - hubbard model and are shown to give rise to @xmath4-particle - induced single - particle and correlated two - particle tunneling in in sec .",
    "( [ sec : single_particle_tunneling ] ) and ( [ sec : two_particle_tunneling ] ) respectively , as well as multibody nearest - neighbor interactions in sec .",

    "( [ sec : higher_order_correlations ] ) , showing that mutual particle avoidance visible in the second order correlation function is more important than the commonly used explanation of broadened single - particle orbitals @xcite .",
    "we start with the single - particle hamiltonian describing atoms of mass @xmath5 in a 3d cubic optical lattice , @xmath6 with the same lattice depth @xmath3 and spacing @xmath7 in each dimension .",
    "we work in units of the recoil energy @xmath8 . performing a band structure calculation and",

    "a short - ranged interaction for two atoms scattering in the @xmath3-wave channel only at the relevant energy scale can be well approximated by a @xmath13-type contact interaction and characterized completely by the @xmath3-wave scattering length @xmath14 .",

    "note that the terms @xmath30 and a part of @xmath31 do not couple different bands , whereas the on - site interaction term @xmath32 conserves the local many - body parity @xmath33 ( for the @xmath34-dimension , others are analogous ) along each dimension , as shown in the appendix",
    ". the local interacting hamiltonian at every site can thus be diagonalized in the subspace corresponding to all multiorbital local states with the same parity as the ground state .",
    "the resulting eigenstates subsequently constitute an alternative set of basis states for the @xmath4-particle local hilbert space .",
    "we now briefly recapitulate the approximations made in the derivation of the standard bose - hubbard model : first , one relies on a strong spatial localization of the single - particle wannier functions . for a sufficiently strong lattice depth @xmath3 , this justifies taking only nearest - neighbor tunneling as well as only on - site interactions into account and neglecting all others .",
    "second , one assumes that all interband couplings ( for any relevant operator ) are negligible , thus justifying a truncation to the lowest single - particle band before constructing the many - particle fock space .",
    "the presence of additional terms of the first kind is intrinsic to the problem and can not be remedied . in a lattice of finite depth and with discrete translational symmetry , the basis states in which all of these couplings would disappear necessarily has spatially completely delocalized basis states ( i.e. they are the bloch fock states in the absence of interactions ) , which contradicts the initial goal of finding a spatially localized basis . on the other hand ,",
    "the problem of interband couplings can be remedied by switching to the basis of local eigenstates . here , the local interband couplings are contained to infinite order in each local eigenstate and the subsequent coupling between the different lattice sites gives rise to an alternative band structure , which we refer to as dressed bands .",
    "this evolution of the local many - particle energy spectrum , where the noninteracting bands continuously evolve into dressed bands is shown in fig .",

    "the local ground state @xmath39 is no longer the pure fock state , with all particles occupying the lowest local wannier orbital , but an admixture of higher wannier orbitals is coupled by the local interaction terms .",
    "this lowers the total energy ( including all orders in perturbation theory ) and can be thought of as a dressed state in an effective lowest - band , as it evolves continuously from the @xmath40 limit and remains gapped from all higher dressed bands for typical interaction strengths .",
    "@xmath41 is the two - body inter - atomic interaction strength of @xmath42rb without the presence of an external magnetic field addressing the feshbach resonance .",
    "in contrast to working in the truncated single orbital wannier basis , this state gives a much better low - energy description containing local correlations , as was confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "spatial localization is furthermore guaranteed , since only higher wannier orbitals at the same site are occupied . ]    for a noninteracting system , the fock state with @xmath43 particles occupying the lowest wannier orbital @xmath44 at site @xmath11 is the local lowest energy state and therefore is well suited as a basis vector for a low - energy description of the system . in the presence of interactions",
    ", @xmath43 is no longer the local lowest energy state , although the fock states still provide a complete basis when taking all bands into account @xcite .",
    "however , for the simulation of interacting many - particle systems , one is often interested in a single - band description , and it is of great importance to find the best possible effective single - band basis . from these many - particle basis states ,",
    "one requires that they    1 .   have the highest possible spatial localization ,",
    "i.e. minimize a localization measure such as the spatial variance of the density profile .",

    "the above criteria are then fulfilled for the following reasons :    1 .",

    "local ground states with different particle number are orthogonal ( or can be chosen as such in the case of degeneracy ) since they are simultaneously eigenstates of the hermitian local many - particle hamiltonian .",
    "states at different sites on the other hand are orthogonal , since by construction they only occupy wannier orbitals at different sites , which are orthogonal on the single - particle level .",
    "5 .   in the noninteracting limit",

    "all longer - range matrix elements ( beyond nearest - neighbor ) from the lattice as well as the interaction hamiltonian are contained in the long - range term @xmath31 .",
    "these will not be discussed in further detail , since their translation into the effective single - band basis is identical to that of the nearest - neighbor terms , they are however generally smaller in magnitude .",
