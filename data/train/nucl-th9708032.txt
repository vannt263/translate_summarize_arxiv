    "superallowed fermi @xmath7 transitions in nuclei , @xmath8 , provide an excellent laboratory for precise tests of the properties of the electroweak interaction , and have been the subject of intense study for several decades ( cf .",
    "@xcite . according to the conserved - vector - current ( cvc )",
    "hypothesis , for pure fermi transitions the product of the partial half - life , @xmath9 , and the statistical phase - space factor , @xmath10 , should be nucleus independent and given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the vector coupling constant for nuclear @xmath7 decay , and @xmath14 is the fermi matrix element , @xmath15 . by comparing the decay rates for muon and nuclear fermi @xmath7 decay , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix element  @xcite between @xmath16 and @xmath17 quarks ( @xmath18 ) can be determined and a precise test of the unitarity condition of the ckm matrix under the assumption of the three - generation standard model is possible  @xcite .    for tests of the standard model , two nucleus - dependent corrections must be applied to experimental @xmath19 values .",
    "the first is a series of radiative corrections to the statistical phase - space factor embodied in the factors @xmath20 and @xmath21 , giving  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath20 is due to standard , electromagnetic ( `` inner '' ) radiative corrections ( cf .",
    "p.  45 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath21 is what has been referred to as the `` outer '' radiative correction ( cf .",
    "p. 47 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) and includes axial - vector interference terms  @xcite . the second correction , which is the subject of this work , arises because of the presence of isospin - nonconserving ( inc ) forces ( predominantly coulomb ) in nuclei that lead to a renormalization of the fermi matrix element .",
    "this correction is denoted by @xmath23  @xcite and modifies the fermi matrix element by @xmath24 , where @xmath25^{1/2}$ ] is the value of the matrix element under the assumption of pure isospin symmetry .    with the corrections @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath23 ,",
    "a `` nucleus - independent '' @xmath26 can be defined by @xmath27 and the ckm matrix element @xmath18 is given by  @xcite @xmath28 where the fermi coupling constant , @xmath29 , is obtained from muon @xmath7-decay , and includes radiative corrections .",
    "currently , @xmath19 values for nine superallowed transitions have been measured with an experimental precision of 0.2% or better  @xcite . with these precise measurements and reliable estimates for the corrections ,",
    "the cvc hypothesis can be confirmed by checking the constancy of the @xmath26 values for each nucleus , while the unitarity condition of the ckm matrix is tested by comparing the average value of @xmath18 with the values determined for @xmath30  @xcite and @xmath31 ( 90% confidence level )  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath32 .    in the past",
    ", the nuclear structure correction @xmath23 has been computed within the framework of the nuclear shell model  @xcite . in general , the isospin - nonconserving components of the nuclear hamiltonian are small , and can be treated perturbatively . due to computational limitations and uncertainties associated with determining an effective hamiltonian , almost all calculations for nuclei with @xmath33 have been performed within a single major oscillator shell , e.g. , for @xmath1c the model space spanned by the @xmath34 and @xmath35 oribitals ( _ p_-shell ) . within this context , two types of isospin mixing must be accounted for .",
    "the first is due to the mixing between states that lie within the shell - model configuration space .",
    "for example , for @xmath36 , there are 2 , 7 , and 1 _ p_-shell configurations leading to @xmath37 and @xmath38 , 1 , and 2 , respectively .",
    "because of its two - body nature , the inc interaction is composed of isospin operators of rank zero ( isoscalar ) , one ( isovector ) , and two ( isotensor ) , and in the case of @xmath36 it is capable of mixing together all @xmath37 states .",
    "traditionally , the configuration mixing correction is denoted as @xmath39 and in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the best estimates for @xmath39 are obtained using an inc interaction that correctly describes the coulomb energy splittings of the binding energies between members of the isospin multiplet , e.g. , the @xmath40 states in @xmath1c , @xmath1b , and @xmath1be .",
    "of the two types of mixing , @xmath39 is the smallest with a magnitude of approximately 0.04 - 0.1% .    in addition to",
    "the mixing between states contained within the shell - model configuration space , mixing with states that lie outside the model space must also be accounted for . in particular , the coulomb interaction can strongly mix one particle - one hole ( @xmath41 ) @xmath42 excitations , e.g. , @xmath43 , into the ground state . in previous works ,",
    "excitations of this type were accounted for by examining differences in the single - particle radial wave functions . indeed , for closed - shell configurations , mixing with @xmath41 states is properly accounted for at the level of hartree - fock .",
    "hence , the second correction to the fermi matrix element , denoted by @xmath44 , was estimated by evaluating the mismatch in the radial overlap between the single - particle wave functions of the converted proton and the corresponding neutron .",
    "the explicit details for the calculation of @xmath44 , which involve a sum over intermediate @xmath45 parent states that then determine the proton and neutron separation energy for the radial wave function , are given in refs .",
    "@xcite . for the most part",
    ", @xmath44 is found to be the larger of the two components ( with @xmath46 ) and has a magnitude of the order 0.1 - 0.8% .    at present ,",
    "two methods for evaluating @xmath44 are espoused .",
    "the first ( thh )  @xcite uses woods - saxon ( ws ) radial wave functions , while in the second ( ob )  @xcite , hartree - fock ( hf ) wave functions are employed .",
    "generally speaking , the two methods yield approximately the same dependence on nucleon number @xmath47 , but the hf values are systematically smaller by 0.1% for the magnitude of the correction .",
    "the reason for the difference lies in the hf mean field .",
    "the principal effect of the coulomb interaction is to push the proton wave functions out relative to the neutrons , hence , providing a mismatch in the radial overlap . in hartree - fock , however , the proton and neutron mean fields are coupled , and the coulomb interaction actually induces an attractive isovector mean field between the protons and neutrons . in effect , the coulomb interaction pushes the protons out , but because of the strong interaction , the protons pull the neutrons out with them , hence , reducing the magnitude of the radial overlap mismatch .",
    "when all _ known _ corrections , i.e. , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath44 , and @xmath39 , are applied to the nine experimental data  @xcite , it is found that the @xmath26 values are essentially constant within the limits of uncertainty but the unitarity limit is violated at the level of approximately 0.4(1)% or 0.3(1)% for the ob and thh corrections , respectively .",
    "in addition , preliminary data from a new experiment for @xmath1c@xcite leads to an @xmath26 value that is significantly smaller than that of ref .",
    "@xcite , and has been interpreted as possible evidence for an , as yet , unaccounted for correction that might lead to satisfying the unitarity condition of the ckm matrix .",
    "in addition , it must be admitted that the present separation between the configuration mixing and radial overlap contributions to @xmath23 is somewhat unsatisfying .",
    "a much better approach would be to perform a shell - model calculation that includes several @xmath48 excitations , so that both corrections would evaluated on the same footing and simultaneously .",
    "because of recent improvements in computational capabilities and the ability to determine an effective model - space hamiltonian based on realistic nucleon - nucleon interactions , it is now possible to perform such a calculation for the lightest of the nine accurately measured transitions .",
    "we report here the results of large - basis shell - model calculations that include excitations up to @xmath0 for @xmath36 nuclides , with an emphasis on evaluating the isospin - mixing corrections to the matrix element for the fermi decay of @xmath1c .",
    "the organization for the paper is as follows .",
    "first , in section  [ sec2 ] we discuss the shell - model hamiltonian with a bound center - of - mass , the method used to derive the starting - energy - independent effective interaction , and the renormalization of the transfer operator .",
    "results of the fermi matrix element calculations are presented in section [ sec3 ] and concluding remarks are given in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "in our calculation we use the one- plus two - body hamiltonian for the a - nucleon system , i.e. , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the nucleon mass and @xmath51 the nucleon - nucleon interaction , modified by adding the center - of - mass harmonic - oscillator potential @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "this potential does not influence intrinsic properties of the many - body system .",
    "it provides , however , a mean field felt by each nucleon and allows us to work with a convenient harmonic - oscillator basis .",
    "the modified hamiltonian , depending on the harmonic - oscillator frequency @xmath54 , may be cast into the form @xmath55 + \\sum_{i",
    "< j}^a \\left [ v_{\\rm n}(\\vec{r}_i-\\vec{r}_j ) -\\frac{m\\omega^2}{2a } ( \\vec{r}_i-\\vec{r}_j)^2 \\right ] \\ ; .\\ ] ] the one - body term of the hamiltonian ( [ hamomega ] ) is then re - written as a sum of the center - of - mass term @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and a term depending on relative coordinates only .",
    "shell - model calculations are carried out in a model space defined by a projector @xmath58 . in the present work",
    ", we will always use a complete @xmath59 model space .",
    "the complementary space to the model space is defined by the projector @xmath60 .",
    "in addition , from among the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ hamomega ] ) , it is necessary to choose only those corresponding to the same center - of - mass energy .",
    "this can be achieved by projecting the center - of - mass eigenstates with energies greater than @xmath61 upwards in the energy spectrum .",
    "the shell - model hamiltonian , used in the actual calculations , takes the form @xmath62p + \\sum_{i < j}^a p\\left [ v_{ij}-\\frac{m\\omega^2}{2a } ( \\vec{r}_i-\\vec{r}_j)^2 \\right]_{\\rm eff } p   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\beta p(h^\\omega_{\\rm cm}-\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega)p\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is a sufficiently large positive parameter .    the effective interaction introduced in eq .",
    "( [ phamomegabeta ] ) should , in principle , exactly reproduce the full - space results in the model space for some subset of states . in practice , the effective interactions can never be calculated exactly as , in general , for an a - nucleon system an a - body effective interaction is required .",
    "consequently , large model spaces are desirable when only an approximate effective interaction is used . in that case , the calculation should be less affected by any imprecision of the effective interaction .",
    "the same is true for the evaluation of any observable characterized by an operator . in the model space ,",
    "renormalized effective operators are required .",
    "the larger the model space , the less renormalization is needed .",
    "usually , the effective hamiltonian is approximated by a two - body effective interaction determined from a two - nucleon system . in this study",
    ", we use the procedure as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . to construct the effective interaction",
    "we employ the lee - suzuki @xcite similarity transformation method , which gives an interaction in the form @xmath63 , with @xmath64 the transformation operator satisfying @xmath65 .",
    "the projection operators @xmath66 project on the two - nucleon model and complementary space , respectively .",
    "our calculations start with exact solutions of the hamiltonian @xmath67 which is the shell - model hamiltonian ( [ hamomega ] ) applied to a two - nucleon system .",
    "we construct the effective interaction directly from these solutions .",
    "let us denote the relative - coordinate two - nucleon harmonic - oscillator states , which form the model space , as @xmath68 , and those which belong to the q - space , as @xmath69 .",
    "then the q - space components of the eigenvector @xmath70 of the hamiltonian ( [ hamomega2 ] ) can be expressed as a combination of the p - space components with the help of the operator @xmath64 @xmath71 if the dimension of the model space is @xmath72 , we may choose a set @xmath73 of @xmath72 eigenevectors , for which the relation ( [ eigomega ] ) will be satisfied . under the condition that the @xmath74 matrix @xmath75 for @xmath76 is invertible",
    ", the operator @xmath64 can be determined from ( [ eigomega ] ) . in the present application we select the lowest states obtained in each channel .",
    "once the operator @xmath64 is determined the effective hamiltonian can be constructed as follows @xmath77 \\ ; .\\ ] ] this hamiltonian , when diagonalized in a model - space basis , reproduces exactly the set @xmath73 of @xmath72 eigenvalues @xmath78 .",
    "note that the effective hamiltonian is , in general , quasi - hermitian .",
    "it can be hermitized by a similarity transformation determined from the metric operator @xmath79 .",
    "the hermitian hamiltonian is then given by @xcite @xmath80^{1/2 } h_{\\rm 2eff}\\left[p_2(1+\\omega^\\dagger\\omega ) p_2\\right]^{-1/2 } \\ ; .\\ ] ] finally , the two - body effective interaction used in the present calculations is determined from the two - nucleon effective hamiltonian ( [ hermeffomega ] ) as @xmath81 .",
    "note that we distinguish the two - nucleon system projection operators @xmath82 from the a - nucleon system operators @xmath83 .",
    "to at least partially take into account the many - body effects neglected when using only a two - body effective interaction , we employ the recently introduced multi - valued effective interaction approach @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "different effective interactions are used for different @xmath48 excitations .",
    "the effective interactions then carry an additional index indicating the sum of the oscillator quanta for the spectators , @xmath84 , defined by @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the total oscillator quanta in the initial and final many - body states , respectively , and @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the total oscillator quanta in the initial and final two - nucleon states @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "@xmath92 is the minimal value of the spectator harmonic - oscillator quanta for a given system . here , for a=10 , @xmath93 .",
    "different sets of the effective interaction are determined for different model spaces characterized by @xmath84 and defined by projection operators    [ projop]@xmath94    in eqs .",
    "( [ projop ] ) , @xmath95 characterizes the two - nucleon model space .",
    "it is an input parameter chosen in relation to the size of the many - nucleon model space .",
    "this multi - valued effective - interaction approach is superior to the traditional single - valued effective interaction , as confirmed also in a model calculation @xcite .",
    "our goal in this study is to evaluate the fermi matrix element @xmath96 which is equal to @xmath97 for an isospin - invariant system .",
    "note that for a system with isospin breaking , the isospin - lowering operator @xmath98 should be renormalized in a similar way , as the interaction used for calculation of the eigenstates appearing in eq .",
    "( [ fermime ] ) .",
    "in fact , we can apply the formalism described in refs .",
    "@xcite to construct a two - body effective operator @xmath99 consistent with the two - body effective interaction derived above and exact for the two - nucleon system .",
    "then we could use such an operator in the a - body calculation .",
    "we studied such a possibility in a solvable - model calculation as described in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we did two - nucleon calculations with the effective @xmath98 operator .",
    "the observed renormalization of the bare operator for the model spaces of the size used in our calculations , was , however , insignificant compared to the other effects as described further .",
    "therefore , in the a - body calculations we used the bare @xmath98 operator .",
    "in order to evaluate the fermi matrix element [ eq .",
    "( [ fermime ] ) ] , we apply the formalism outlined in section [ sec2 ] for a=10 nuclei . in the calculations we use the reid93 nucleon - nucleon potential @xcite and consider the following isospin - breaking contributions .",
    "first , the reid93 potential differs in the @xmath3 channels for pn and pp , nn systems , respectively .",
    "second , we add the coulomb potential to the pp reid93 potential . consequently , using the eqs .",
    "( [ eigomega])-([hermeffomega ] ) , we derive different two - body effective interactions for the pn , pp , and nn systems .",
    "no other mechanisms for isospin breaking are considered .",
    "as we derive the effective interaction microscopically from the nucleon - nucleon interaction , the number of freely adjustable parameters in the calculation is limited .",
    "first , we have the choice of the model - space size in the shell - model diagonalization .",
    "that is , however , constrained by computer capabilities .",
    "the largest model space we were able to use was the space allowing all @xmath0 excitations relative to the unperturbed ground state .",
    "most of the calculations were done in the m - scheme using the many - fermion - dynamics code @xcite extended to allow the use of different pn , pp , nn interactions .",
    "we also performed some calculations with the oxbash shell - model code  @xcite . in the m - scheme ,",
    "the dimensions associated with @xmath1b and @xmath1c are 581,740 and 430,137 , respectively . to study the dependence on the model - space size , we performed calculations in the @xmath42 space as well . in that space , the dimensions drop to 14,502 and 10,111 , respectively .",
    "second , we have the choice of the two - nucleon model space used for the evaluation of the effective interaction .",
    "this is related to the many - nucleon model - space size , and , in principle , is determined by that size .",
    "traditionally , however , the @xmath100 space used to determine the g - matrix does not , necessarily , coincide with the many - particle model space @xcite . in our calculation , the two - nucleon model space is characterized by a restriction on the number harmonic - oscillator quanta @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 . here , @xmath104 is the harmonic - oscillator quantum number for the nucleon @xmath105 .",
    "this type of restriction guarantees an orthogonal transformation between the two - particle states and the relative- and center - of - mass - coordinate states . for the present @xmath0 calculation",
    ", the choice of @xmath106 appears to be appropriate .",
    "however , it has been observed in the past  @xcite that when the lee - suzuki procedure combined with the g - matrix calculation according to ref .",
    "@xcite ( which is equivalent to the procedure we are using ) is applied to calculate the two - body effective interaction , the resulting interaction may be too strong .",
    "this is , in particular , true , when the multi - valued approach is used .",
    "several possible adjustments were discussed to deal with this problem @xcite and amounted to introducing an extra parameter . in the present calculations , we do not introduce any new parameter , but rather we treat @xmath95 as a free parameter and use @xmath107 for the @xmath0 calculations and @xmath106 for the @xmath42 calculations , respectively . with this choice",
    "we obtain quite reasonable binding energies for the studied nuclei .",
    "we have also performed several @xmath42 test calculations with single - valued interactions that were derived following ref.@xcite , as opposed to the multi - valued interaction discussed in the previous section . to obtain reasonable binding energies with the single - valued interaction",
    "we do not have to change the @xmath95 value from that corresponding to the many - nucleon space , e.g. , @xmath108 for the @xmath42 calculation .",
    "this difference of treatment of the two types of interactions follows from the fact that the overall strength of the single - valued interaction is weaker .",
    "third , our results depend on the harmonic - oscillator frequency @xmath54 .",
    "we have studied this dependence by performing calculations for the values @xmath109 , and @xmath110 mev .",
    "let us also mention one important feature of the present approach .",
    "for both the multi - valued and the single - valued interactions our calculations do not break the separation of the center - of - mass and the internal relative motion . in particular , a variation of the parameter @xmath7 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ phamomegabeta ] ) does not change the eigenenergies and other characteristic of the physical states .",
    "this is so due to the choice of a complete @xmath59 many - nucleon space and the triangular two - nucleon model space for deriving the effective interaction as well as the due to the procedure used to derive the effective interaction .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : b1014 ] , [ fig : b10155 ] , and [ fig : b1017 ] we present the experimental and calculated spectra of @xmath1b for @xmath109 , and @xmath110 mev , respectively , for the @xmath42 and @xmath0 model spaces . in general",
    ", we observe an overall improvement in the spectra with the enlargement of the model space in all three cases . also , the @xmath0 calculations exhibit more stability with regard to changes in the harmonic - oscillator frequency than do the @xmath42 results .",
    "the agreement with experiment improves when going from @xmath111 mev to @xmath112 mev ; in particular for the ground state and the lowest states . in fact , from fig .",
    "[ fig : b1017 ] we find that a very reasonable description of the spectra is obtained for @xmath112 mev .    in table",
    "[ tab : tab1 ] , the overall behavior with respect to @xmath48 is illustrated .",
    "in general , we observe a reasonable reproduction of the binding energy , with a moderate decrease occuring for increasing @xmath48 .",
    "using free - nucleon effective charges , we find that although the quadrupole moment for the @xmath113 state is underestimated considerably , the magnetic dipole moment is well reproduced . in addtion , the point - proton rms radius exhibits a fairly strong dependence , and increases with decreasing @xmath48 . for the rms radius , we find that the best agreement with experiment  @xcite is achieved for @xmath111 mev",
    ".    from the point of view of the beta decay of @xmath1c , a good description of the @xmath3 states is important . from figs .",
    "[ fig : b1014]-[fig : b1017 ] we can see that the calculated @xmath1b @xmath3 states have the right relative positions and are reasonably stable with variations of both the model - space size and @xmath48 . we have also performed @xmath0 calculations for @xmath1be to study the splitting of the isospin analog states in the whole isospin - multiplet @xmath1c - @xmath1b - @xmath1be . the experimental ground state splitting between @xmath1c and @xmath1be is 4.66 mev , while our calculated values are 4.68 , 4.83 , and 4.94 mev for @xmath109 , and @xmath110 mev , respectively .",
    "the best agreement with experiment is achieved for @xmath111  mev , where the calculated rms point - proton radius is also in agreement with the experimental value . on the other hand ,",
    "the splitting between the @xmath114 states of @xmath1c and @xmath1b , which is experimentally 2.69 mev , is overestimated in our calculations by @xmath115 , and @xmath116 for the @xmath1175 , and @xmath110 mev calculations , respectively .",
    "since the correct @xmath1c - @xmath1be splitting is obtained for @xmath111 mev , the excess in the @xmath1c - @xmath1b splitting suggests that the isospin breaking due the strong @xmath3 force may be too large .",
    "one possible explanation is that our approach for deriving the effective interaction tends to exaggerate the differences between the pn and nn , pp potentials .",
    "such an artificial effect should decrease with increasing model - space size . on the other hand , it is also possible that the reid93 potential itself overestimates differences between the pn and pp , nn systems in the @xmath3 channel . for the most part , we find the best overall agreement for the rms point proton radius , binding energy , and coulomb energy splitting for @xmath111 mev .",
    "given that the isospin mixing is largely driven by the coulomb interaction , which is then dependent on the size of the nucleus , we feel that the best value for the isospin - mixing correction to the fermi matrix element will be achieved for @xmath111 mev .",
    "the most important results of our study are also summarized in table  [ tab : tab1 ] in the last two lines .",
    "the calculated isospin - mixing corrections @xmath118 , in % , are presented for all three choices of @xmath54 and for both @xmath0 and @xmath42 model spaces .",
    "again , a correlation between the radius and the isospin - mixing correction is clearly observed , as @xmath23 decreases with increasing radius .",
    "this is simply understood in terms of a larger radius implying weaker coulomb effects . on the other hand , with an increase in the model - space size , a significant increase in the isospin - mixing correction",
    "is apparent .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the larger model space , the excitation energies of the 1p-1h @xmath114 states decrease , hence leading to greater mixing .",
    "for this reason , the more realistic multi - valued effective interaction is important .",
    "we have also performed test calculations with the single - valued interaction in the @xmath42 space , and found @xmath6 to be smaller by approximately 30% .",
    "our @xmath0 results suggest an isospin - mixing correction @xmath119 .",
    "this is compatible with the previously published value of @xmath120 by ormand and brown @xcite . that value was a sum of two contributions .",
    "first , about 0.04% came from the shell - model wave - function renormalization due to the isospin mixing and was obtained in a @xmath5 shell - model calculation using phenomenological effective interactions .",
    "second , the amount 0.09% was due to the deviation from unity of the radial overlap between the converted proton and the corresponding neutron .",
    "this effect was attributed to the influence of states lying outside the @xmath5 space .",
    "the radial wave - functions were obtained in a hartree - fock calculation using skyrme - type interactions .",
    "because we use a multi - configuration model space in the present calculation , we should have both effects included consistently at the same time .",
    "another important factor in the calculation is the position of the @xmath42 states . as discussed before",
    ", the position of the 1p-1h states influences the ground - state isospin mixing .",
    "unfortunately , the excitation energy of these states is not known experimentally . however , in our calculations the multi - valued effective interaction is used and a more realistic description of these states should be obtained ; especially , in the @xmath0 model space . on the other hand , in an analogous calculation for @xmath121he , it was observed that an @xmath122 model space is needed to get the @xmath42 dominated @xmath123 state close to the experimental excitation energy @xcite .",
    "there are states like @xmath124 at 5.18 mev in @xmath1b or @xmath114 at 6.18 mev in @xmath1be , which are believed to be 2p-2h , @xmath42 excitations .",
    "we do not observe any such states below 7.5 and 12 mev , respectively , in our calculations .",
    "the first excited @xmath114 state in @xmath1be obtained in the @xmath0 calculation with @xmath111 mev lies at 9.8 mev .",
    "it is , however , predominately a @xmath5 state .",
    "there can be two reasons why we do not get such states .",
    "first , these states have not yet converged in the lanczos procedure .",
    "second , and more likely , the @xmath0 model space is too small for the right description of the @xmath42 excitation states .",
    "therefore , it would be desirable to extend the present calculations to a larger , e.g. , @xmath125 model space . unfortunately , due to the computational limitations , it is not possible at this time to perform a calculation of this magnitude .",
    "however , from table [ tab : tab1 ] we observe an increase of @xmath6 by @xmath126 between the @xmath42 and the @xmath0 calculation .",
    "therefore , we might expect an increase of similar magnitude for an increase of the model - space size beyond @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the more realistic value of the isospin - mixing correction from our calculation would be @xmath127 , where the uncertainty is estimated from the change in @xmath23 obtained when using an increased model space .",
    "the effects of isospin mixing on the transition matrix element for the superallowed fermi @xmath7-decay of @xmath1c were estimated within the context of a large - basis , shell - model calculation .",
    "the calculations were performed assuming no closed core and an effective interaction based on a realistic two - body nucleon - nucleon interaction , while including the coulomb interaction between protons .",
    "contrary to previous estimates for the isospin corrections , this calculation was carried out within a model space that included many @xmath48 excitations . as a consequence , the conventional configuration mixing and radial mismatch contributions were evaluated within a unified framework , simultaneously and the usual separation was not necessary . with regard to parameters used within the calculation , we find a correlation between the isospin - mixing correction and the coulomb splitting between the isotopic multiplets , which , in turn , is governed by the nuclear size through the oscillator parameter . given that the isospin - mixing correction is primarily a coulomb effect , the best value for @xmath23 is taken to coincide with the oscillator parameter that correctly reproduces the coulomb splittings . with regard to the model - space size , a clear improvement ( or an indication towards convergence ) in most observables is evident when the size of the model space is increased from @xmath42 to @xmath0 , but @xmath23 is found to increase by only 0.03% ( in magnitude ) in this case . hence , our final estimate for @xmath23 is taken to be 0.12(3)% ( where the @xmath0 result has been increased by 0.03% to account for the possible effects of an increased model space ) .",
    "this result also happens to be in excellent agreement with the previous estimates that relied on the conventional separation of the configuration and radial mismatch contributions . finally , we note that the magnitude of the isospin - mixing correction obtained in our calculation does not lead to a resolution to the deviation from unitarity for the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix .",
