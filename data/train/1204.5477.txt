    "the modern cosmology provides at least two experimental evidences for the existence of new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "one of them is the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) .",
    "the other one is the dark matter ( dm ) which constitutes most of the gravitating mass in the universe . to be consistent with the observations , the dm candidate should be a very weakly interacting particle . for a sterile neutrino dm - candidate",
    "there are two ways to achieve the observed dm abundance .",
    "the first possibility is that the sterile neutrino interacts so weakly , that it never enters thermal equilibrium after the reheating ( @xmath0msm situation @xcite or models with extra - dimensions @xcite , see also section * 1  d * of @xcite for a more comprehensive review ) .",
    "here we are going to pursue another interesting possibility , described in @xcite .",
    "we assume in this paper that the sm gauge group is embedded in some larger group ( for concreteness we consider a left - right symmetric group @xmath1 ) and the right handed neutrinos are charged under this group : @xmath2 this additional gauge interaction brings all the right handed neutrinos into the thermal equilibrium at some high temperature .",
    "in such a scenario the right - handed neutrinos are expected to be heavy and the active - sterile mixings , which are important for our scenario , are generally expected to be tiny . if one of the sterile neutrinos ( called @xmath3 ) is light ( kev scale ) , it can be stable enough to be a dm candidate by a reasonable tuning of the coupling constants . however , being a light thermal relic , one may expect that it is significantly overproduced .",
    "this problem is , however , not an issue if there is a later dilution of the overproduced amount of the dm neutrino by a subsequent out - of - equilibrium decay of another massive particle . a good and most natural candidate for such a particle is a heavier",
    "right handed neutrino ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "if it also has a sufficiently small mixing angle with left handed neutrinos then it freezes out at high temperatures together with @xmath3 ( due to identical gauge interactions ) .",
    "later it decays to the sm particles while being significantly out of equilibrium , thus diluting the abundance of the dm sterile neutrino @xmath3 .",
    "models of this type are able to reproduce the experimentally observed dm abundance provided that certain constraints on the model parameters are imposed @xcite . in short , there are very strict bounds on the yukawa couplings of the dm sterile neutrino which are required to suppress its radiative decay constrained by the x - ray observations ( see @xcite for a review and @xcite for details ) and bounds on the yukawa couplings of the other sterile neutrino appearing from the requirement of the entropy generation ( which controls the dm density ) . in addition",
    "there are bounds on the masses of the sterile neutrinos and additional gauge bosons , appearing from the fact that the entropy generation should happen before the big bang nucleosynthesis ( see section 2.7 of @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to providing a dm candidate , any viable extension of the sm should also be able to explain the observed bau . in models with right - handed sterile neutrinos",
    "it is rather natural to expect additional _",
    "cp_-violation in the neutrino sector leading to the generation of a lepton asymmetry ( leptogenesis ) , which later on is transferred to the baryon asymmetry by the sphaleron processes .",
    "the simplest possibility here is the usual thermal leptogenesis at high temperatures , associated with _",
    "cp_-asymmetric decays of the heavy sterile neutrinos .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to demonstrate that the constraints imposed by the requirement of successful dark matter production are compatible with leptogenesis .",
    "thus both the dark matter of the universe and the bau can be explained together in a rather minimalistic scenario where heavy sterile neutrinos decay to one light sterile neutrino .",
    "we also find additional constraints on the neutrino masses , appearing from the requirement of successful leptogenesis and analyze possible patterns of masses and decay widths of the sterile neutrinos in the model .",
    "the lepton asymmetry generated in the decay of the heavy neutrino @xcite is converted into the bau by sphaleron processes @xcite .",
    "this implies that the generation of the lepton asymmetry should happen before sphaleron freezeout ( @xmath5{gev}$ ] ) , and that the sterile neutrinos should be out of thermal equilibrium at higher temperatures .",
    "these two requirements are similar to the bbn constraints found in @xcite , where it was required that the heavy sterile neutrinos decay before the bbn . in complete analogy with @xcite",
    "we require that sterile neutrino @xmath6 decays into the sm particles before sphaleron freezeout and generates sufficient entropy to dilute the dm sterile neutrino ( @xmath3 ) abundance . replacing the bbn temperature by the sphaleron freezeout temperature ( denoted by @xmath7 here ) in eqs .",

    "this constraints the strength of the gauge interaction of the right handed neutrinos or , equivalently , the mass @xmath10 of the additional gauge bosons .",
    "although this requirement is similar to those in @xcite , the lower bound on the neutrino mass @xmath11 is now larger and the lowest possible value for @xmath10 is higher @xmath12{gev}}\\right)^{3/4 }        \\unit[10 ^ 4]{tev }    \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the gauge coupling constant for the additional gauge group .",
    "all other constraints formulated in @xcite for successful dm generation are left intact .    to achieve proper entropy dilution",
    ", the entropy generating neutrino @xmath4 should decouple while relativistic and has decay width @xmath14 which can be used to calculate the yukawa couplings of @xmath4 .",

    "the first term in the square brackets describes the generation of the lepton asymmetry and is proportional to the deviation of the majorana neutrinos from thermal equilibrium .",
    "the second term describes washout effects due to the inverse decays of the heavy neutrinos and is proportional to the generated lepton asymmetry @xmath26 .",
    "the contribution of the same processes to the right - hand side of the rate equations for the majorana number density is given by @xcite : @xmath27}{e } d\\omega_p\\,=-\\langle \\gamma_{n_i}\\rangle ( n_{n_i}-n_{n_i}^{eq})\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the model under consideration the right - handed neutrinos are efficiently equilibrated by the @xmath28 gauge bosons . before the freezeout of the gauge interactions the right - handed neutrinos are in thermal equilibrium and no asymmetry is generated .",
    "after the freeze - out the requirement that one of the majorana neutrinos is dark matter together with the universality of the @xmath28 gauge interactions implies that all three heavy species are completely out of equilibrium @xcite . in this case the washout processes play no role and the second term on the right - hand side of eq . can be neglected .",
    "therefore , the rate equation for the lepton asymmetry takes a simple form : @xmath29 since the initial lepton asymmetry and the final number densities of @xmath30 are zero , its solution reads : @xmath31 to convert the particle yield into the leptonic asymmetries we should take into account that after the freezeout at @xmath32 additional entropy was generated by the decays of the heavy neutrinos . using",
    "we get for the lepton number density to the entropy ratio after the decay of @xmath30 @xmath33 where @xmath26 and @xmath34 are lepton and sterile neutrino number densities , index @xmath35 corresponds to the freezeout and index @xmath36 to some moment after the heavy neutrino has decayed . assuming that the sterile neutrino decouples while still being relativistic its initial abundance is @xmath37 the entropy generation factor @xmath38 is due to the out of equilibrium decay of heavy sterile neutrino @xmath39 @xcite @xmath40 here we would like to stress two points .",
    "first , the formula is derived for @xmath41 , which is motivated by the fact that @xmath42 is required to obtain a proper dm density @xcite @xmath43{kev}}\\right )    \\;.\\ ] ] second , we have in principle two entropy generating neutrinos .",
    "it is easy to check that if the decay rates @xmath44 and @xmath45 are significantly different ( while the masses are similar ) , then the resulting entropy generation is dominated by the neutrino with the smallest decay width , see .",
    "if both decay widths or entropy generation factors @xmath46 and @xmath47 are of the same order the result can be obtained by numerical solution of the differential equations from @xcite , generalized to the multi - species case .",
    "the generated lepton asymmetry is transferred to the baryon asymmetry by sphalerons with the coefficient @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath49 we then find @xmath50 which is to be compared with the experimentally measured value @xmath51 .",
    "since the washout processes are strongly suppressed in the considered model , successful leptogenesis is possible if @xmath52 .",
    "the _ cp_-violating parameter in the decay of the @xmath53th neutrino receives two contributions .",
    "the self - energy contribution is given by @xcite : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is defined by @xmath56 .",
    "for the on - shell quasiparticle approximation that we use here the ` regulator ' @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 , see @xcite for more details .",
    "the vertex contribution to the _ cp_-violating parameter reads @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60\\xrightarrow{x\\gg1 } \\frac{-1}{2\\sqrt{x}}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since the dm candidate has a mass of order of a few kev , the corresponding _ cp_-violating parameter is strongly suppressed by the mass ratio and its contribution to the lepton asymmetry can be neglected .",
    "furthermore , the effective in - medium masses of the higgs and leptons are of order of one tenth of the temperature , so that the decays of the lightest majorana neutrino are kinematically forbidden . therefore only the two heavier neutrinos @xmath30 are relevant for the asymmetry generation .      in the considered model the washout processes",
    "are strongly suppressed .",
    "therefore the usual argument that the asymmetry generated by the heavier majorana is washed out by the inverse decay and scattering processes mediated by the lighter one is not applicable .",
    "this means that even for a hierarchical mass spectrum we have to consider contributions of both majorana neutrinos . for a hierarchical mass spectrum",
    "the sum of the self - energy and vertex contributions can be approximated by : @xmath61\\quad   { \\rm if } \\quad m_i\\gg m_j\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath62 the @xmath63 term is a large negative number and therefore both expressions have the same overall sign . in the following",
    "we enumerate the heavy neutrinos such , that the leading contribution to the entropy generation is due to @xmath4 , i.e.   @xmath64 .",
    "then the requirement of sufficient entropy dilution , see eq .",
    ", implies that @xmath65 on the other hand the ratio @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the see - saw contribution to the effective mass of the active neutrino , is essentially unconstrained .",
    "combined with this implies that for reasonable masses of the right - handed neutrinos @xmath68 is always strongly suppressed as compared to @xmath69 . in other words ,",
    "most of the lepton asymmetry is generated by @xmath4 .",
    "depending on the choice of the model parameters there are three distinct situations :    1 .   if @xmath70 then @xmath71 . assuming maximal _ cp_-violating phase , i.e.  assuming that @xmath72,we find for the _ cp_-violating parameter : @xmath73 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\ll   \\frac{\\gamma_2}{m_2}\\left[2+\\ln m_3 ^ 2/m_2 ^ 2\\right ] \\sim 10^{-5}\\frac{m_2}{m_{pl}}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore successful leptogenesis is only possible if @xmath74 and this case is excluded .",
    "2 .   if @xmath75 then @xmath76 .",
    "the resulting expression for the _ cp_-violating parameter is the same as in the previous case and successful leptogenesis is again possible only if @xmath74 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath77 then both @xmath76 and @xmath78 are possible . in the former case",
    "the _ cp_-violating parameter is given by : @xmath79 \\nonumber\\\\ & = \\frac{\\tilde m_{33}m_3}{8\\pi v^2}\\frac{m_3}{m_2}\\left[2+\\ln m_3 ^ 2/m_2 ^ 2\\right]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whereas in the latter case we obtain @xmath80 since the see - saw contributions of the first and second heavy neutrinos should be small , see @xcite , @xmath81 should not contribute significantly to the neutrino masses , i.e.  should not exceed the atmospheric mass difference exceeds the atmospheric mass difference , nontrivial cancellations between the type i and type ii contributions are required . ] .",
    "we can see that if the hierarchy between @xmath11 and @xmath82 is mild , the required asymmetry is produced for @xmath83{gev}$ ] , which is well below the gut scale .",
    "that is , in this case the _",
    "cp_-violating parameter can be large enough to generate the required amount of the baryon asymmetry .",
    "note also that the gauge interaction scale bound , corresponding to this value , is also below the gut scale , @xmath84{gev}$ ] .    from the above analysis it follows that for a hierarchical mass spectrum     schematic plot of the parameter space where correct baryon asymmetry and dark matter abundance are realized .",
    "the dots correspond to quasidegenerate mass spectra where the above analysis is not applicable . ]",
    "the correct baryon asymmetry and dark matter abundance can be generated only if @xmath77 , i.e. if the lepton asymmetry is generated by the same heavy neutrino which is responsible for the entropy production . the points of the parameters space where this is the case are schematically depicted in fig.[parameterspace ] .      for a quasidegenerate mass spectrum of the heavy neutrinos",
    "the _ cp_-violating parameter is resonantly enhanced . in this regime",
    "the vertex contribution is much smaller than the self - energy one and can be neglected .",
    "the size of the _ cp_-violating parameter is controlled by the difference of the right - handed neutrino masses , see eq .. if the mass difference is not too small , @xmath85 , then one can neglect medium corrections to the masses @xcite . in this regime the @xmath86 term in can still be neglected and we obtain @xmath87 since we enumerate the right - handed majorana neutrinos such that @xmath64 and @xmath88 in the case under consideration then @xmath89 . combined with this implies that @xmath90 . in other words , just like for a strongly hierarchical mass spectrum , most of the lepton asymmetry is generated by the neutrino responsible for the entropy production .",
    "the required magnitude of the _ cp_-violating parameter , @xmath91 , can now be achieved even if @xmath55 is as small as @xmath92 .",
    "the condition ensures that @xmath4 decays before the sphaleron freezout so that the generated lepton asymmetry is converted into the baryon asymmetry .",
    "therefore , successful leptogenesis is possible even if @xmath11 is as light as @xmath93 gev .    for smaller values of @xmath94 the enhancemet of the _ cp_-violating",
    "parameter is even stronger .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that for very small mass differences the usual quasiparticle approximation used in the present analysis breaks down @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the oscillating behavior of the heavy neutrino propagators leads to a suppression of the final asymmetry @xcite .",
    "it is also important to note that since leptogenesis in this scenario can occur at temperatures much smaller than the ones where charge lepton yukawa interactions enter in equilibrium , the flavour effects can become important and affect the final result for the baryon asymmetry @xcite .",
    "this analysis however is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we have analyzed the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe in scenarios with an extended gauge sector where a kev scale sterile neutrino is a dm particle .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the dm abundance can be controlled by the entropy produced in the out of equilibrium decay of one of the other two heavier neutrinos .",
    "here we have found that the decays of the same neutrino can also lead to the generation of a significant lepton asymmetry , leading to the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe , but at a price of a stronger bound on the extra gauge interaction scale and the heavy sterile neutrino masses . for reasonable values of the model",
    "parameters the third heavy neutrino does not contribute significantly to the asymmetry generation . for a hierarchical mass spectrum of the heavy neutrinos",
    "the resulting constraints on the masses of the model are stronger than those in @xcite , pushing the masses of the heavier sterile neutrinos and right handed gauge bosons to the @xmath95{gev}$ ] scale . for a quasidegenerate mass spectrum",
    "the _ cp_-violating parameter is resonantly enhanced and the required amount of the asymmetry can be produced even if the majorana neutrinos are as light as @xmath96{gev}$ ] .",
    "note that our scenario is incomplete in the sense that some mechanism must explain the lightness of @xmath3 and the very tiny active - sterile mixings .",
    "examples where these properties are explained by flavour symmetries @xcite show that there might be a very interesting connection between dark matter , the baryon asymmetry of the universe and neutrino flavour properties ."
