    "a prerequisite for analyzing and understanding the electronic properties and the function of surfaces , is the detailed knowledge of the atomic structure , i.e. , the surface composition and geometry . in this respect",
    "the experimental techniques of ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) _ surface science _ have significantly helped to build our current understanding,@xcite and sometimes these uhv results can be related to high - pressure applications , like catalysis or corrosion . often , however , such extrapolation is not straightforward and may even be impossible.@xcite this is due to the fact , that some surface structures that can be stabilized in uhv - sometimes by sophisticated preparation , annealing , and post - dosing procedures - may not exist at high temperature , @xmath2 , and high pressure , @xmath3 . and structures that exist at high pressure may be hard or even impossible to identify or stabilize under uhv conditions . obviously , knowing what structures dominate the high - pressure application one is interested in , is crucial for finding a way to prepare the same or a similar situation under uhv conditions , in order to then perform controlled , atomistic experiments .",
    "thus , the determination of a ( @xmath4 ) phase diagram , covering the surface phases from uhv to realistic conditions appears to be critical for a meaningful and safe bridging of the pressure gap , enabling a _ surface science _",

    "we described the approach in detail for a one - component gas phase , and we now extend it to a multi - component environment also employing the concept of a `` constrained thermodynamic equilibrium '' ; at the end we will also analyze ( and emphasize ) the role of kinetic effects . a short paper on this study already appeared.@xcite    we believe that the below discussion is relevant to oxidation catalysis at a ruthenium catalyst , but the applicability of the methodology is much wider . from the calculated surface phase diagram",
    ", a number of conclusions on the experimentally reported high efficiency of this oxide surface @xcite can already be drawn .",
    "most notably , we emphasize that gas phase conditions , that correspond to a coexistence of different surface phases , may lead to an enhanced dynamics and be particularly important for catalytic applications . for the specific example of the ruo@xmath0(110 ) surface",

    "the presence of two independent reservoirs of o@xmath1 and co implies that o@xmath1 and co molecules , though their mix forms the environment , are not in equilibrium with each other : from energy considerations alone , co@xmath0 would result as the most stable gas phase molecule for almost all temperature and pressure conditions , _ if _ the environment were able to attain thermodynamic equilibrium with itself .",
    "however , the large free energy barrier for the gas phase reaction co + 1/2 o@xmath13 co@xmath0 prevents that this reaction plays any role on the time scales of interest .",
    "thus , our treatment ignores ( because of good reasons ) co@xmath1 formation in the gas phase , and only at the end of our study ( sections iii d - f ) we will consider that such a reaction may take place between species that are adsorbed on the surface . as a consequence , the oxygen and co chemical potentials in this `` constrained thermodynamic equilibrium '' situation are given by the expressions discussed in the next paragraph .",

    "this allows us not only to conveniently draw the surface free energies of three most stable o and co containing geometries into fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( solid lines ) , but gives also the low @xmath46-limit for these phases . as explained in section iiia , in this co - rich limit the c chemical potential is determined by the equilibrium with graphite below @xmath47ev and with co above , which is why the corresponding three lines in fig .",

    "the co involving surface phases become increasingly less favorable , whereas the surface free energies of the two pure o terminations do of course not depend on @xmath49 .",

    "[ fig3 ] is instructive for understanding the extension of the surface free energy dependence from a one - component to a two - component environment , the three - dimensional nature of the plot does not allow an easy access to the really important information contained in it , i.e. which phase has the lowest @xmath46 and is thus most stable for a given gas phase characterized by @xmath41 and @xmath49 .",
    "this information is better obtained by only drawing the stability regions of the most stable phases , which corresponds to a projection of the lowest surface free energies in fig .",

    "the stoichiometric o@xmath32/ phase is stable at low o chemical potential , while higher o@xmath0 pressures stabilize additional oxygen at the surface , leading to the o@xmath32/o@xmath35 phase .",
    "increasing the co content in the gas phase , co is first bound at the cus sites .",
    "this is easier at low o chemical potentials , where these sites are free , but is harder at higher @xmath41 where also oxygen atoms compete for adsorption at the cus sites . as a result , towards higher @xmath41",
    "the o@xmath32/co@xmath35 phase becomes only more stable than the o@xmath32/o@xmath35 phase at progressively higher co chemical potentials , cf .",
    "[ fig4 ] . finally , under very reducing conditions ( high @xmath49 , low @xmath41 ) co is able to substitute o also at the bridge sites , yielding the completely co covered co@xmath32/co@xmath35 surface . additionally shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is the line marking the instability of ruo@xmath0 with respect to co - assisted decomposition at high @xmath49 ( white dotted line ) . from the location of this line",
    "we see that the complete stability region of the co@xmath32/co@xmath35 phase ( including the graphite - formation region hatched in black ) and large parts of the o@xmath32/co@xmath55 phase correspond already to metastable situations that will not prevail for long under realistic conditions .",
    "the surface phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] summarizes the key results of the present work .",
    "however , before proceeding to discuss the physics contained in it , we like to discuss the accuracy of our theory .",
    "as stated in section iic , the numerical uncertainty in the surface free energies due to the dft basis set and the supercell approach is about @xmath56 mev / @xmath57 . if we allow the four planes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] to shift by this value with respect to each other , the resulting intersections , i.e. the phase boundaries , would shift within the white regions drawn in fig . [ fig4 ] .",
    "we have added additional axes in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] indicating the pressure scales at @xmath58k and 600k . from these scales",
    "it becomes apparent , that at room temperature our computational uncertainty may very well correspond to even a few orders of magnitude in pressure . on the other hand , this is only so , because at @xmath59k these one or two orders of magnitude in pressure sample only a vanishingly small part of phase space .",
    "in general , we believe that fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] illustrates quite nicely that our numerical inaccuracy does not affect the general structure of the obtained phase diagram at all - even if it would , it would just mean that we would have to increase our basis set .",
    "this error analysis does not yet include the more basic deficiency of dft , namely the approximate nature of the exchange - correlation functional . to this end , we have also computed the surface phase diagram not with a gradient - corrected functional , but with the local - density approximation ( lda ) @xcite .",
    "the result ( obtained by a complete geometry reoptimization of all structures using the lda lattice constants ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and is very similar to the gga results ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the absolute surface free energies for the different phases obtained within the lda are up to 20 mev / @xmath57 higher than the gga results .",
    "however , their differences , which ultimately determine the positions of the phase boundaries , differ only little .",
    "although this lda and gga comparison does not provide a quantitative assessment of the remaining error that is due to the approximate treatment of exchange and correlation , the obtained small difference strongly suggests that the dft - accuracy for this phase diagram is rather high . in line with our previous analysis",
    "@xcite we therefore conclude that the approximate nature of the exchange - correlation functional may affect the exact phase transition temperatures and pressure ( with a typical uncertainty of @xmath60k and 1 - 2 orders of magnitude in pressure ) , but does not affect the overall structure of the obtained phase diagram .",
    "the main outcome of the preceding section is the surface phase diagram of ruo@xmath0(110 ) in `` constrained thermodynamic equilibrium '' with an environment formed of o@xmath0 and co in the complete range of experimentally accessible gas phase parameters .",
    "kinetic effects due to catalytic co oxidation at the surface may obviously cause deviations from this situation , and we will show in the following how the obtained surface phase diagram may be analyzed to identify corresponding regions in @xmath61-space where such kinetic effects may become crucial and/or a high catalytic activity may be expected .    in general , the surface will be close to our `` constrained thermodynamic equilibrium '' with the reactant gas phase , as long as the on - surface co@xmath0 formation is the rate - limiting step . then , adsorption and desorption of the reactants can occur frequently on the time scale of the reaction event , allowing the chemical potentials of gas phase and adsorbed particles to equilibrate . in this context",
    "we note that the only proper definition of thermodynamic equilibrium is this equality of chemical potentials .",
    "this is not equivalent to saying that the adsorption and desorption rate of o and co is equal .",
    "this would only be true , if no other channels for removing the particles from the surface existed . instead",
    ", in catalysis we can have the situation , that desorption _ and _ reaction compete with adsorption , but this must not necessarily mean that the chemical potentials of the reactants could nt still equilibrate with the ones in the gas phase ( provided the reaction event rate is low ) .    on the other hand , if the final reaction step is not rate - limiting and the bottleneck of the reaction",
    "would e.g. be given by the adsorption process(es ) , adsorbate(s ) would be faster consumed by the final reaction than replenished by the slow adsorption from the gas phase . under such conditions , the adsorbate concentration can be much lower or due to preferential adsorption much different to what is predicted by a thermodynamic theory . still , in the present case the kinetic effects",
    "will even then be restricted to the immediate surface population at bridge and cus sites , provided one stays within the range of the ruo@xmath0 bulk stability discussed in section iiia , i.e. below the dotted white line in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] : the creation of vacancies in the oxide bulk lattice is simply too costly , cf . the binding energy of o@xmath62 in table [ tableii ] . a mars - van - krevelen type mechanism , where the oxidation reaction is noticeably dependent on oxygen diffusion through the bulk @xcite , appears therefore rather unlikely for ruo@xmath0(110 ) in a more oxidizing gas phase ( @xmath63 ) . only if the steady - state reaction is run under gas phase conditions close to the dotted instability line in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] would we expect this to become different , in which case also oscillations between metallic and oxidic state might become perceivable.@xcite      analyzing the surface phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] along the lines described in the preceding section , the part of the o@xmath32/co@xmath35 phase below the dotted instability line appears to be a likely region in @xmath64-space where catalysis might be most efficient : in contrast to all other phases , both reactants are then adsorbed at the oxide surface , indicating as dominant reaction mechanism co@xmath35 + o@xmath65 co@xmath0",
    ". we will show below that the co@xmath0 formation energy barrier for this process is noticeable ( 1.25 ev , in good agreement with the result of liu , hu and alavi@xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the energy to create vacancies in the o - bridge layer is rather high ( 2.37 ev , cf .",
    "table [ tableii ] ) , so that we would expect the surface to be rather close to the `` constrained equilibrium '' situation under such gas phase conditions .",
    "the mechanism between o@xmath32 and co@xmath35 has already been suggested on the basis of extensive uhv experiments @xcite , where it had initially been characterized as a mars - van - krevelen type reaction , given that o@xmath32 is adsorbed at the bridge sites which correspond to a continuation of the bulk oxide lattice stacking . as most of the experiments were not conducted at steady - state , but employed co postdosage in uhv @xcite , a further reduction of the surface was also reported , in which after o@xmath32 had been reacted off , co subsequently occupied also the bridge sites @xcite .",
    "while this is fully compatible with the higher binding energy of co at the bridge sites , cf .",
    "table [ tableii ] , the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] reveals that under consideration of the environment , an extremely large co / o@xmath0 partial pressure ratio ( corresponding to an almost pure co atmosphere ) would be required to really be able to stabilize co at the bridge sites in the co@xmath32/co@xmath35 phase , cf . the given pressure scales .",
    "even then such a situation would not prevail for long under realistic conditions , as ruo@xmath0 is then already instable against co - assisted decomposition into ru metal .",
    "hence , the initially identified part of the o@xmath32/co@xmath35 phase is still a more likely candidate for a catalytically active region .",
    "the question remains if this is already the part in @xmath66-space where we expect the ruo@xmath0 catalysis to be most efficient ? in this respect we note that a so - called stable phase in our thermodynamic approach is not stable on a microscopic scale , but represents an average over fluctuations of elementary processes such as dissociation , adsorption , diffusion , association and desorption .",
    "as all these processes and their interplay @xcite are of crucial importance for catalysis , regions in @xmath67-space where such fluctuations are particularly pronounced are expected to be most important",
    ". this will be the case under gas phase conditions , which correspond to regions in the computed surface phase diagram close to boundaries between different stable phases : at finite temperatures , the transition from one phase to the other will not be abrupt in @xmath68-space , but over a pressure range in which the other phase gradually becomes more populated . the resulting phase coexistence at the catalyst surface could then lead to a significantly enhanced dynamics , in which even additional reaction mechanisms ( in case of microscopically coexisting phases ) or reaction fronts ( in case of domain pattern formation ) might become operational .    assuming a canonic distribution of the two competing phases @xcite we have correspondingly estimated the region on both sides of the boundaries in which the respective other phase is present at least at a 10% concentration , and marked it as white regions for the case of @xmath58k in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and fig .",
    "concomitantly , one of these boundary regions ( the one between the o@xmath32/co@xmath35 and the o@xmath32/o@xmath35 phases , henceforth termed cus - boundary ) , for which we would thus expect an enhanced dynamics , falls just into gas phase regions , for which the exceptionally high turnover rates over working ru catalysts have been reported , i.e. for ambient pressures in an about equal partial pressure ratio @xcite . along this cus - boundary",
    "both reactants compete for adsorption at the cus sites .",
    "provided the rather low lateral interactions between neighboring cus sites described in section iiib a microscopic coexistence of both phases appears then likely , i.e. neighboring cus sites could be occupied independently by either o or co. this would open up an additional reaction channel , co@xmath35 + o@xmath69 co@xmath0 , which had already been observed as a dominant mechanism in uhv experiments on preoxidized ruo@xmath0(110 ) , as long as o@xmath35 atoms where available on these surfaces @xcite .    below we report a rather low barrier of 0.9 ev for this process , so that o@xmath35 atoms can react away rapidly under these conditions .",
    "if the filling of empty sites with co will also be fast as is the case in the hatched region of the o@xmath32/o@xmath35 phase close to the cus - boundary , then the surface will not be close to the constrained thermodynamic equilibrium situation and the real o@xmath35 concentration may be much lower than suggested in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] . from our argument",
    "we therefore expect high catalytic activity in this region , but also note that here coverage and structure ( i.e. the very dynamic behavior ) must be modeled by statistical mechanics .",
    "although the equilibrium approach thus breaks down just in this most interesting region , we see that it still enables us to rationalize under which gas phase parameters highest activity is to be expected .",
    "while this already helps to embed the uhv measurements into the catalytic context , the phase diagram also allows to systematically analyze when and how the pressure gap may be bridged in corresponding experiments : namely , when it is assured that one stays within one phase region or along one particular phase boundary , assuming that then the same reaction mechanism will prevail . for example , at an about equal partial pressure ratio of o@xmath0 and co a decrease of ambient gas phase pressures over many orders of magnitude will at room temperature only result in a wandering close to the cus - boundary in @xmath68-space , cf .",
    "correspondingly , we would conclude , that similar reaction rates should result , as has indeed recently been noticed by wang _",
    "@xcite when comparing their uhv steady - state kinetic data with high pressure experiments of zang and kisch @xcite .    however , from fig . [ fig4 ]",
    "it is also obvious that without the knowledge of a @xmath67-phase diagram , as e.g. provided by the present work , a naive bridging of the pressure gap by simply maintaining an arbitrary constant partial pressure ratio of the reactants may easily lead to crossings to other phase regions and in turn to uncomparable results .",
    "in this respect it is particularly important to notice that e.g. the cus - boundary does _ not _ exactly fall on the equal partial pressure ratio line .",
    "there is no reason it should , and already at @xmath70k the same aforedescribed decrease of ambient gas phase pressures would bring one rapidly away from the cus - boundary until at uhv pressures one even ends up deep inside the stability region of the o@xmath32/ phase , cf .",
    "consequently , the computed phase diagram leads us to predict that kinetic measurements at this temperature and uhv pressures will result in a very low catalytic activity , as under such conditions no co can bind to the surface anymore .",
    "this reactivity would then , however , be contrasted by the extremely high turnover numbers reported for working ru catalysts close to ambient pressures at exactly the same temperature @xcite , in other words a typical pressure gap situation .      in the course of the preceding section two likely oxidation mechanisms",
    "have been identified , in which co@xmath35 reacts with oxygen adsorbed at either a neighboring bridge or a neighboring cus site . as apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] both channels take place along high symmetry lines parallel to the surface : along the @xmath71 $ ] direction for reaction with o@xmath32 ( dashed line ) and along the @xmath72 $ ] direction for reaction with o@xmath35 ( dotted line ) , respectively , so that we are in both cases left with a planar configuration and may neglect the degrees of freedom perpendicular to this plane formed by the corresponding in - surface and the out - of - surface [ 110 ] direction . even assuming the underlying oxide substrate as rigid",
    ", we are thus facing at least a six - dimensional problem , involving as one possible choice the following set of variables : lateral and vertical position of c@xmath35 , lateral and vertical position of the adsorbed o , as well as the co bondlength and the polar angle of the co molecular axis with respect to the surface . in order to shed more light on the importance of the two possible reaction mechanisms we proceed to determine their respective transition state ( ts ) using large @xmath73 unit - cells to decouple the periodic images of the reacting species . within these cells ,",
    "we map out the potential energy surface ( pes ) along two reaction coordinates , namely the lateral positions of the c@xmath35 and the adsorbed oxygen within the given reaction plane , while minimizing the energy at each point with respect to all remaining degrees of freedom ( including full a relaxation of the underlying oxide lattice ) .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the mapped pes for the reaction co@xmath35 + o@xmath74 co@xmath0 , which according to our phase diagram is likely for a large range of gas phase parameters corresponding to the stability region of the o@xmath32/co@xmath35 phase . the total lateral distance between a neighboring",
    "cus and bridge site is 3.21  , cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and we find the ts at a rather large lateral c@xmath35 displacement of 1.44  , while the o@xmath32 atoms move only by 0.21  away from their equilibrium position . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the ru@xmath35-c@xmath35 distance is therefore remarkably lengthened at the ts ( 2.40  compared to 1.99  at the initial state ) , whereas the ru@xmath32-o@xmath32 distance is only slightly stretched ( 1.98  compared to 1.92  ) .",
    "looking at the binding energies compiled in table [ tableii ] , we can identify as one reason for this asymmetric behavior the significantly larger binding energy for o@xmath32 compared to co@xmath35 .",
    "nevertheless we compute a rather low reaction barrier of 1.25ev for this process , which compares favorably with the value of 1.15ev reported in an earlier pseudopotential study by liu , hu and alavi employing a constrained minimization for the o@xmath75-co@xmath35 bond length @xcite . as also pointed out in that work , already this mechanism on ruo@xmath0(110 )",
    "should have a higher reactivity than the ru(0001 ) surface , for which the co oxidation barrier was computed to be 1.45ev in a @xmath76 cell.@xcite    turning to the second mechanism , co@xmath35 + o@xmath77 co@xmath0 , we notice that the ts location in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] has strongly shifted compared to the one displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . at the ts",
    "also the o@xmath35 atoms have now moved laterally by 0.73  stretching their bondlength from 1.70  at the initial state to 1.79  , so that the ru@xmath35-c@xmath35 bondlength needs only to be increased to 2.08  in comparison to the 2.40  required for the prior reaction .",
    "this difference can again be understood by looking at the binding energies listed in table [ tableii ] , from where the much lower bond strength of o@xmath35 becomes apparent , that should facilitate an easier displacement in comparison to the much stronger bound o@xmath32 atoms . in line with the thus expected higher reactivity of the o@xmath35 atoms , we indeed find a much lower barrier of only 0.89ev for this mechanism .    in view of the surface phase diagram shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , this co@xmath35 + o@xmath69 co@xmath0 reaction is primarily expected under the phase coexistence conditions along the cus - boundary .",
    "concomitantly , it is also gas phase parameters that correspond to this cus - boundary , for which the exceptionally high turnover numbers over working ru catalysts have been reported @xcite . obtaining a particularly low barrier for a reaction mechanism that may preferably be operational under just these conditions fits thus not only nicely to the observed high reactivity , but also underlines as specific example , that the enhanced dynamics in phase coexistence regions might be crucial to understand the function of surfaces under realistic conditions .",
    "in conclusion we have computed a _",
    "first - principles _ based phase diagram of the lowest energy surface structures of ruo@xmath0(110 ) in the `` constrained equilibrium '' with an environment formed of o@xmath0 and co. depending on the chemical potentials of both gas phase species a number of different surface phases is found , ranging from two different exclusively o containing terminations to a completely co covered surface .",
    "we showed how this surface phase diagram can be analyzed to identify gas phase conditions where kinetic effects due to the co oxidation reaction may become crucial and/or a high catalytic activity can be expected . in view of the possibly enhanced dynamics",
    ", we emphasize the particular importance of phase coexistence regions close to boundaries in the computed surface phase diagram , and suggest that a reliable bridging of the pressure gap is possible , provided that one stays within one phase region or along one particular phase boundary .",
    "concerning the specific application to the co oxidation over ruo@xmath0(110 ) we showed that the gas phase parameters , for which exceptionally high turnover numbers have experimentally been reported , correspond to phase coexistence conditions at the catalyst surface , in which the reaction co@xmath35 + o@xmath69 co@xmath0 may be active in addition to the hitherto favored co@xmath35 + o@xmath74 co@xmath0 .",
    "for the prior mechanism we calculate a significantly lower barrier of 0.89ev compared to the 1.25ev for the latter channel , which for this specific example underlines that phase coexistence conditions might indeed be relevant to understand the reactivity of this catalyst surface .",
    "our analysis exemplifies that calculations of the kind presented in this work can be used to identify important reaction steps at any given @xmath67 in the gas phase and to already explain a number of experimental findings on the surface reactivity . yet",
    ", a real microscopic description of catalysis can only be obtained by subsequent computations of the kinetics of the manyfold of possible elementary processes , as well as simulations addressing the statistical interplay among them . to obtain meaningful results from the latter type of studies",
    "the consideration of all relevant atomistic steps is crucial , the identification of which will be greatly facilitated by the prerequisite of knowing the various stable surface phases in equilibrium with the given gas phase .",
    "consider a system with @xmath78 surface sites and a small number of @xmath79 defect or adsorbate sites ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "then , the configurational entropy @xmath81 is given by @xmath82 if we define @xmath83 as the surface area per site , the configurational entropy per surface area is @xmath84 for @xmath85 we can apply the stirling formula which gives @xmath86.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the expression in the square brackets varies between 0 ( for (",
    "n / n ) = 0 ) and 1.2 ( for ( n / n)=10% ) .",
    "thus , the configurational entropy @xmath87    for ruo@xmath0(110 ) , considering two sites ( bridge and cus ) per @xmath31 unit - cell , implies that @xmath88@xmath57 .",
    "correspondingly , we deduce a configurational contribution to the surface free energy of less than 5 mev / @xmath57 for any @xmath89k .",
    "this is negligible everywhere in the phase diagram apart from the phase coexistence regions .",
