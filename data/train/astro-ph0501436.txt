    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) can show both broad ( fwhm@xmath15  km  s@xmath16 ) and narrow ( fwhm@xmath17  km  s@xmath16 ) emission lines .",
    "while both lines are excited by the central ionizing continuum source , the broad lines arise from the immediate vicinity of the central massive black hole ( @xmath18  pc ) , and the narrow lines arise further out , sampling the host galaxy dynamics , and possibly chemical composition and gas distribution as well . the strength and profiles of the narrow emission lines were studied extensively over the past 30 years , revealing radial gradients in the density and ionization state of the gas , and some characteristic trends in the line profiles ( e.g. heckman et al .",
    "1981 ; osterbrock 1989 ; peterson 1997 ; vanden berk et al . 2001 ) .",
    "one remarkable property of the narrow emission lines , which has not been explored yet in detail , is their extreme range of equivalent widths ( ews ) .",
    "specifically , in the boroson & green ( 1992 , hereafter bg92 ) sample of 87 @xmath6 quasars from the bright quasar survey ( schmidt & green 1983 ) , the narrow [ ]  @xmath05007line ranges in ew from 157    to undetectable ( @xmath2   ) , i.e. by a factor of @xmath1 , while in contrast the ew of the broad h@xmath3line in the same sample ranges only over a factor of 10 ( 23  230   ) .",
    "the narrow line ew is mainly set by two factors , the covering factor ( cf ) of the photoionized gas at the narrow line region ( nlr ) , and the line emissivity ( assuming no foreground absorption ) .",
    "the cf is set by the spatial distribution of the gas at the nlr , and by the angular distribution of the illuminating ionizing radiation .",
    "the latter may be set by the continuum emission mechanism , or through obscuration further out ( e.g. by the ` torus ' ) .",
    "the line emissivity for collisionaly excited lines , such as [ ]  @xmath05007 , is set by the gas electron density @xmath4 , the gas temperature , and by the gas ionization state .",
    "the last two properties are set by the ionizing photon flux , or equivalently the ionization parameter ( @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the density of h ionizing photons ) . _ which of the above factors produces the large range in ews of the narrow emission lines ? _",
    "the purpose of this paper is to answer this question for the [ ]  @xmath05007  line .",
    "we have chosen this line since it is generally the strongest and least blended narrow emission line in agn .",
    "our approach is to measure the strength of the narrow [ ]  @xmath04363  and h@xmath3  lines in a large sample of agn , where the [ ]  @xmath05007  line was already measured .",
    "the [ ]  @xmath04363/ [ ]  @xmath05007  line ratio is mainly a measure of @xmath4 , while the h@xmath3  line is dominated by recombination and thus mostly sensitive to the cf of the gas .",
    "the combination of the three lines allows us to determine the cf , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 of the [ ]  @xmath05007  emitting gas , and thus find which factor most strongly modulates the strength of the line .",
    "this derivation relies on the simplifying assumption that h@xmath3 , [ ]  @xmath05007 , and [ ]  @xmath04363  originate in a single zone with homogeneous gas properties .",
    "we relax this assumption by also making an extreme two zone approximation , where [ ]  @xmath05007  is mostly emitted by an outer low density nlr component , and [ ]  @xmath04363  by an inner high density component , and again explore whether the strength of the [ ]  @xmath05007  line is mostly modulated by the cf or by the gas emissivity .",
    "the [ ]  @xmath05007  line is one of the main components contributing to the set of strongly correlated agn emission properties , so called ` eigenvector 1 ' ( hereafter ev1 , bg92 ) .",
    "we therefore also briefly explore whether the physical parameters controlling the strength of [ ]  @xmath05007  are linked to other ev1 emission properties .",
    "the determination of @xmath5 and @xmath4 allows us to calculate the distance of the nlr from the central ionizing continuum source , @xmath21 , and we also look for relations between @xmath22 and other agn properties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , in section 2 we provide a brief theoretical justification for the set of lines used in this analysis , and explain how the nlr parameters are derived . in section 3",
    "we describe the sample used and the narrow line measurement procedure .",
    "the results are described and discussed in section 4 , and the main conclusions are provided in section 5 .",
    "the [ ]  @xmath05007  and [ ]  @xmath04363  lines are particularly useful for constraining @xmath23 and @xmath4 of the nlr gas which produces the [ ] line emission .",
    "both lines arise from the same element , eliminating abundance effects .",
    "furthermore , they both arise from the same ionization state , eliminating ionization level corrections .",
    "both lines arise through collisional excitation , and although they correspond to similar transition energy , they differ in two respects .",
    "first , [ ]  @xmath05007  arises from excitation to the @xmath24 level , located 2.51  ev above the ground ( @xmath25 ) level , while [ ]  @xmath04363arises from excitation to the @xmath26 level , 5.35  ev above the ground level .",
    "thus , their ratio is a useful temperature diagnostic when @xmath27  ev .",
    "in addition , the two transitions have different radiative decay rates , leading to critical densities for collisional dexcitation of @xmath28  @xmath11 for [ ]  @xmath05007  and @xmath29  @xmath11 for [ ]  @xmath04363 .",
    "thus , the [ ]  @xmath04363/ [ ]  @xmath05007  line ratio is also a useful density diagnostic , when the density is not much above or below the two critical densities ( e.g. osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "an additional advantage of the [ ]  @xmath05007  line is that it is typically the main coolant of the nlr ( amounting to as much as @xmath30 per cent of the total cooling ) , and thus its absolute intensity is only a weak function of the o abundance ( through the metalicity dependence of the gas temperature ) .",
    "figure 1 presents curves of constant log  [ ]  @xmath04363/ [ ]  @xmath05007  photon flux ratio as a function of the electron density and temperature .",
    "the calculations are based on a 6-levels [ ]  model ( excitations to levels above the 6th level , @xmath26 , do not contribute significantly to the two [ ]  lines at the relevant temperatures ) .",
    "the level energies were obtained from moore ( 1993 , p.  267 ) , and radiative transition probabilities and mean collision strengths from pradhan & peng ( 1995 , table 1 there , for @xmath31  k , relevant here).(2@xmath32s@xmath33 ,  2@xmath34s@xmath35 ) and @xmath36(2@xmath32s@xmath33 ,  2@xmath34d@xmath37 ) , were not available , and we therefore assume are equal to 1 . ]",
    "the figure demonstrates the weaker dependence of the line ratio on @xmath4 at the lowest @xmath4 , and weaker dependence on @xmath23 as the highest @xmath23 .    in photoionized gas",
    "it is more natural to use @xmath5 , which is often a free parameter in photoionization calculations , rather than @xmath23 which is set by @xmath5 and @xmath4 through detailed photoionization calculations .",
    "1 presents the dependence of @xmath23 on @xmath4 and @xmath5 , as deduced from the photoionization code cloudy  ( ferland et al .",
    "it demonstrates the weak dependence of @xmath23 on @xmath4 , at a given @xmath5 , and the overall small range in @xmath23 ( @xmath38-@xmath39  k ) when @xmath5 varies from @xmath40 to @xmath41 . assuming a uniform @xmath4 gas , the measured value of [ ]  @xmath04363/ [ ]  @xmath05007  ( corresponding to a certain curve in fig  .1 ) yields the allowed range of @xmath4 as a function of the range in @xmath5 .",
    "e.g. , if the measured line ratio is 0.1 , then the implied density is @xmath42 to @xmath43  @xmath11 , for @xmath44 to @xmath40 . as can be seen in fig .  1 , the allowed range in @xmath4 increases as the line ratio gets smaller .    breaking the @xmath4 , @xmath5",
    ", degeneracy requires an additional line .",
    "the optimal line for that purpose is h@xmath3 .",
    "it is a nearly pure recombination line at the expected nlr conditions ( where collisional and optical depth effects should be small ) , and thus its intensity provides an estimate of the fraction of ionizing radiation intercepted by the nlr , i.e. the nlr cf .",
    "the [ ]  @xmath05007/h@xmath3ratio provides the additional constraint on @xmath4 and @xmath5 , required to break the degeneracy .",
    "the h@xmath3  ew , together with the ew of [ ]  @xmath05007 , and [ ]  @xmath04363 , allow us to determine @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and the cf of the [ ]  emitting gas in the nlr . from the observational aspect the h@xmath3  line is also optimal , as it is located close to the two [ ]  lines , allowing all three lines to be obtained in a single spectrum , minimizing systematic measurement errors .",
    "also , the close wavelength proximity of the lines minimizes dust reddening effects on the measured line ratios .",
    "as noted above , we use the photoionization code cloudy  to calculate the strength of [ ]  @xmath05007 , [ ]  @xmath04363 , and h@xmath3 , as a function of @xmath4 ( from @xmath45  @xmath11 to @xmath46  @xmath11 ) , @xmath5 ( from @xmath40 to @xmath41 ) , and the cf .",
    "the additional input model parameters for cloudy  are a slab geometry with a total column of @xmath47  @xmath48 , ism abundances with grains , and a standard mathews & ferland ( 1987 ; herafter mf ) agn continuum with a break at 1  @xmath49 ( ferland et al .",
    "the results are not sensitive to the assumed column since the dust opacity strongly suppresses line emission from columns beyond @xmath50  @xmath48 ( laor & draine 1993 , hereafter ld ) .",
    "the effect of the ionizing continuum shape is explored by calculating the model results again with a different ionizing spectrum , as further described in section  4 .",
    "figure 2 presents the calculated line flux ratios and ew as a function of @xmath4 for different values of @xmath5 .",
    "the upper panel shows the [ ]  @xmath05007/h@xmath3flux ratio .",
    "this ratio decreases with increasing @xmath4 due to collisional suppression of the [ ]  @xmath05007  line at @xmath51 .",
    "the ratio increases with @xmath5 at low @xmath5 , as the fractional abundance of  increases , and starts decreasing at @xmath52 , as o gets ionized beyond ( the dust opacity suppresses emission from deeper layers where o is less ionized ) .",
    "the middle panel shows the [ ]  @xmath04363/ [ ]  @xmath05007  flux ratio .",
    "this ratio is mostly set by @xmath4 due to the different @xmath53 of the two lines , as discussed above .",
    "the weak dependence on @xmath5 results from the weak dependence of @xmath23 on @xmath5 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the lower panel shows the h@xmath3  ew for a cf  =  1 . at low @xmath5 the h@xmath3",
    "ew is independent of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , as expected for a pure recombination line . at @xmath54 the h@xmath3  ew starts decreasing due to the increasing suppression of the line emission by absorption in dust within the ionized gas ( voit 1992 ; ld ; netzer & laor 1993 ; ferguson et al .",

    "the two solutions correspond to different cf values ( the larger @xmath5 requires a larger cf to produce the observed h@xmath3  ew , fig .  2 lower panel ) . obtaining a unique solution",
    "requires additional constraints on @xmath5 or cf .",
    "as further described in section 3 , almost none of our objects happens to lie within the degenerate solution regime .",

    "binette et al .",
    "( 1996 , and references therein ) discuss evidence for the presence of significant contribution to the nlr emission from matter bounded gas .",
