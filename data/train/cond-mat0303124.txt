    "the monumental discovery of high-@xmath0 superconductivity in strongly correlated electrons in cuprates@xcite has kicked off intensive studies on superconductivity in repulsively interacting electron systems .",
    "these studies have brought to light the spin - fluctuation mediated pairing mechanism , which gives rise to anisotropic cooper pairing instabilities . so identifying the optimum condition for pairing in the repulsively interacting electron systems is one of the most fascinating goals of theoretical studies , since it should give a guiding principle in searching for higher-@xmath0 materials .",
    "a fundamental question in this context is a repeatedly asked one :  why is @xmath0 in the electron - mechanism superconductivity so low ? \"",
    "although this may at first sound strange , this is true in that the estimated @xmath0 for ordinary lattices is at best @xmath1@xcite which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the starting electronic ( hopping ) energy , @xmath2 .",
    "there are in fact good reasons why @xmath0 is so low .",
    "one is that the spin - fluctuation mediated interaction is much weaker than the original electron - electron interaction .",
    "another important reason , also quite inherent in the electron mechanism , is the following .",
    "if one wants to have superconductivity from repulsion , pairing has to be anisotropic , since the nodes in the gap function , which convert the repulsion to an attraction in the gap equation , realize the superconductivity .",
    "namely , the pair - scattering processes ( the matrix elements of the interaction that connect two electrons around the fermi surface to another positions ) contribute positively to the gap equation when there is a node across the pair - scattering momentum transfer . unfortunately",
    ", the nodes greatly reduce @xmath0 : while the gap function has opposite signs across the main pair scattering ( e.g. , @xmath3 for the antiferromagnetic spin - fluctuation exchange ) , there are other pair scattering processes across the regions of the fermi surface having the same sign , and these work against the pairing and lowers @xmath0 .",
    "since the nodes are imperative in anisotropic - pairing superconductivity , this problem is unavoidable as far as the ordinary lattices are concerned .",
    "so a novel avenue to explore is : can we improve the situation by going over to multiband systems . in this context kuroki and arita@xcite",
    "have proposed that the systems that have _ disconnected fermi surfaces _ are a promising candidate for higher-@xmath0 superconductivity . in such systems",
    "the gap function can change sign _ across the fermi surfaces _ but not within each fermi surface , so that all of the main pair - scattering processes contribute positively to superconductivity .",
    "the estimated @xmath0 for two - dimensional ( 2d ) repulsive hubbard model on such lattices is indeed almost an order of magnitude higher , @xmath4 .",
    "the disconnected fermi surface has been subsequently explored in other models and systems@xcite .    as for the dimensionality of the system , on the other hand ,",
    "three of the present authors have systematically studied@xcite the hubbard model on 2d and 3d single - band lattices with the fluctuation - exchange approximation ( flex ) , and have clarified that 2d systems are generally more favorable than 3d systems as far as the spin - fluctuation - mediated superconductivity in ordinary lattices ( square , triangular , fcc , bcc , etc ) are concerned .",
    "the  best case \" among the ordinary lattices is identified to be the d - wave pairing in the square lattice , and the above - mentioned @xmath5 in fact refers to this case .",
    "physical reason why 2d is more favorable is that the fraction of the phase volume over which the fluctuation - mediated interaction exerts significant attractions is much smaller in 3d.@xcite @xmath0 estimated by solving eliashberg s equation with flex is indeed only @xmath6 even for the best 3d case ( as far as simple lattices are concerned ) .",
    "similar results have also been obtained by monthoux _",
    "et al._@xcite independently by means of a phenomenological calculation .",
    "recent experimental finding@xcite that a series of heavy - fermion compounds ce(rh , ir , co)in@xmath7 has higher @xmath0 when the structure is more two - dimensional ( with larger @xmath8 ) is consistent with this prediction ( although orbital degeneracies in the heavy - fermion compound may exert some effects ) .",
    "now , if one puts these two observations ( i.e. , one on the disconnected fermi surface and another on the dimensionality ) , a natural question arises : can we conceive _",
    "3d lattices having disconnected fermi surfaces _ that have high @xmath0 s .",
    "in other words , can the disconnected fermi surface overcome the disadvantage of 3d to possibly realize @xmath9 ) , which should be a fundamental question for the spin - fluctuation mediated pairing .",
    "more specifically , what we have in mind is the _ inter - band nesting _ in the 3d disconnected fermi surface as schematically depicted in fig.[pri ] .    there",
    ", a nesting vector exists across the two bands , and this is envisaged to give the attractive pair - scattering interaction with a nodal plane running in between the two bands .",
    "note that a pair is formed within each band , although the nesting is inter - band . in such a case",
    "the gap function should be nodeless within each band , while the gap has opposite signs between the two bands . in this sense",
    "the mechanism is an extension of the time - honored suhl - kondo mechanism , although there are important differences since here we consider bands originating from multiple orbitals of the same type connected by single electron hopping in order to have appropriate nesting between the disconnected fermi surfaces , while suhl - kondo considers basically the bands originating from different ( e.g. , s and d ) orbitals that interact only via multi electron processes .",
    "for the survey in lattice structures , there are two possible approaches : ( i ) to find 3d lattice structures whose fermi surfaces are disconnected , and consider the 3d - version of the mechanism originally proposed for 2d lattices,@xcite ( ii ) stack the 2d lattices already proposed@xcite for which @xmath10 has been estimated , and introduce the interlayer hopping , @xmath11 , to see how the @xmath0 behaves as @xmath11 is increased . as for the former approach , we have recently studied superconductivity in 3d stacked honeycomb lattice,@xcite where the fermi surface consists of two networks of tubes .",
    "however , the networks of tubes have turned out to have such a strong structure that the intra - band as well as inter - band pair - scattering processes contribute to the gap equation , and the resulting gap function has nodes ( with @xmath12-wave symmetry ) within each band . accordingly , the estimated @xmath13 is low , and the stacked honeycomb lattice does not realize the 3d - version of inter - band nesting conceived here .",
    "this has motivated us in the present study to look for models that have more compact and structure - less fermi surfaces .",
    "we have found that a stacked bond - alternating lattice ( fig .",
    "[ lattice ] ) has a compact and disconnected fermi surface ( i.e. , a pair of ball - like fermi pockets ) .",
    "we then show for the multiband hubbard model on this lattice that the inter - band pair - scattering alone is dominant .",
    "the estimated @xmath0 is @xmath1 , which is the same order of that for the square lattice , and remarkably high for a 3d system .    as for the second approach of stacking the 2d lattices ,",
    "we have studied the @xmath11-dependence of the pairing instability for stacked ladder lattice ( fig .",
    "[ lattice ] ) . we have found that the @xmath10 , found for the single layer , is unexpectedly robust against , or even increases with , @xmath11 when @xmath11 is not too strong .",
    "we have then identified the underlying physics for the favorable condition for the superconductivity on disconnected fermi surfaces  the system should be quasi - low dimensional , and the peak in the spin susceptibility should be appropriately `` blurred '' .",
    "so we shall conclude that the idea of raising @xmath0 in superconductivity from repulsive electron - electron interaction on disconnected fermi surfaces can work in 3d lattices if we consider appropriate lattice structures .",
    "here we take the repulsive hubbard model , a simplest possible model for repulsively interacting electron systems .",
    "so the interaction is the ordinary on - site repulsion , @xmath14 , but the lattice has two atoms per unit cell here accompanied by two bands . the hamiltonian is @xmath15 where @xmath16 label a , b sublattices with standard notations otherwise . for the transfer energies",
    "@xmath2 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are intra - layer hoppings , while @xmath11 the inter - layer ( see fig . [ lattice ] ) .",
    "we employ the flex method developed by bickers _",
    "et al_.@xcite in the two - band version of flex,@xcite green s function @xmath20 , self - energy @xmath21 , susceptibility @xmath22 , and the gap function @xmath23 all become @xmath24 matrices , such as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 a , b sublattice , @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the matsubara frequency for fermions .    the self - energy is given in the flex as @xmath29,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the particle - hole ( @xmath30 ) and particle - particle ( @xmath31 ) fluctuation - exchange interactions are given as @xmath32_{\\alpha\\beta}\\!\\!\\!+\\frac{1}{2}u^2\\!\\!\\left[\\frac{\\chi^{{\\rm ph}}(q)}{1+u\\chi^{{\\rm ph}}(q)}\\right]_{\\alpha\\beta}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\nonumber\\\\ & & -u^2\\chi_{\\alpha\\beta}^{\\rm ph}(q),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath33_{\\alpha\\beta}\\\\\\ ] ] with @xmath34 here we denote @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the matsubara frequency for bosons , and @xmath37 the number of @xmath38-points on a mesh .",

    "we have searched for the case where the inter - band nesting is strong with a weak intra - band nesting along the following line .",
    "we start from the stacked honeycomb lattice , where the tubular fermi surface connected along @xmath52 directions has too strong an intra - band nesting as mentioned.@xcite one way to make the fermi surface more compact and structureless is to introduce alternating bonding structures in the @xmath52 plane .",
    "for example , if the in - plane bonds along @xmath53 alternate between weak ones ( @xmath54 ) and strong ones ( @xmath55 ) , where the array of strong and weak ones is staggered as we go along @xmath56 direction .",
    "we can then connect the layers with the third - direction hopping @xmath11 , and we call this the stacked bond - alternating lattice ( fig . [ lattice ] ) .",
    "we have varied @xmath17 and @xmath11 to examine the pairing instability over the region @xmath57 with a fixed @xmath58 for the band filling @xmath59 .",
    "this region has turned out to correspond to the case of compact fermi pockets .",
    "the repulsion is taken to be @xmath60 , which is a typical value for strongly correlated systems .",
    "hereafter we take @xmath19 as the unit of energy . the fermi surface and the spin susceptibility for a typical case ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 )",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ opt - fchi ] .",
    "we can see that the fermi surface comprises a pair of compact , ball - like pockets",
    ". there exists , as intended , a dominant nesting vector in the stacking direction ( @xmath63 ) across the two pockets , as confirmed from a strong peak in @xmath64 around @xmath63 in fig .",
    "[ opt - fchi ] .",
    "figure [ ( a ) ] shows the result for the dependence of the largest eigenvalue , @xmath46 , of eliashberg s equation on the inter - layer hopping , @xmath65 , for @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "we can see that @xmath46 increases with @xmath11 .",
    "this indeed occurs as the two fermi pockets ( displayed in red and blue ) begin to be formed and the inter - band nesting across the pockets , that should favor the pairing , develops . for this choice of parameters",
    ", however , the superconductivity gives way to antiferromagnetism ( whose boundary is identified here to the situation when @xmath68 ) around the value of @xmath11 at which @xmath46 reaches unity .",
    "nevertheless we are on the right track in that the gap function is , as intended , nodeless ( gapful ) in each band while changes sign across the two bands .",
    "so we should next tune the shape of the two fermi pockets .",
    "this can be achieved by varying the weak hopping , @xmath17 , in the bond - alternating system . as seen in fig .",
    "[ ( b ) ] , the fermi surface for each band remains to be two balls throughout , but they become more compact as @xmath17 is increased .",
    "if we turn to @xmath46 in the figure for a fixed @xmath62 with @xmath66 , @xmath46 indeed reaches unity well before the antiferromagnetism sets in . in the case of @xmath69 ( with a low @xmath0 ) ,",
    "the gap function has a nodal plane as shown by green sheet in fig .",
    "[ ( b ) ] , which should be due to the main @xmath70 pair scattering in large antibonding band fermi surface favor node to change the sign across the scattering .",
    "so we conclude for the bond - alternating model that , although disconnected fermi surfaces are favorable for the inter - band pairing , the fermi pockets have to be compact so that the intra - band pair - scattering is suppressed and the gap function for each band becomes nodeless .    we have then scanned the @xmath71 parameter plane to optimize the values of @xmath17 and @xmath11 , and found that @xmath46 takes its maximum at @xmath61 , @xmath62 . in fig .",
    "[ opt - elia ] , temperature dependence of @xmath46 for the optimized case is plotted .",
    "we can see that @xmath72 , which is remarkably high ( i.e. , @xmath73 the bandwidth with the bandwidth @xmath74 ) for a 3d system ( where usually @xmath75 bandwidth at most as estimated for the simple cubic lattice@xcite ) .",
    "let us move on to the stacked connected - ladder lattice ( right panel in fig.[lattice ] ) .",
    "in this subsection , we fix @xmath76 .",
    "this value of @xmath18 turns out to give the highest @xmath0 for @xmath60 . in 2d",
    "kuroki and arita@xcite have shown that a larger @xmath77 gives a higher @xmath0 , but in the present case of 3d the tendency toward af is stronger , so that we take a weaker @xmath60 as in the previous section .",
    "figure [ c ] shows @xmath46 and @xmath78 as a function of the inter - layer hopping @xmath11 for a fixed @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",
    "we can see that @xmath46 is as large as , or even greater than , in 2d ( @xmath81 ) up to @xmath82 . for smaller @xmath83 the fermi surface",
    "consists of only one band ( two panels at bottom left in fig.[c ] ) . in this case",
    "the inter - band nesting is weak , as seen from a small @xmath78 ( top right in fig.[c ] ) .",
    "when @xmath84 , the system becomes quasi-2d along the @xmath85 plane , and a nesting in the direction of @xmath86 evolves ( as evident from the shape of the fermi cylinders that change their direction from @xmath87 to @xmath88 ) . while @xmath78 monotonically increases with @xmath11 throughout , superconductivity is most favored ( @xmath89 in between ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the resultant @xmath91 in the 3d system is @xmath92 bandwidth ( with the bandwidth @xmath93 ) , which is even higher than in the above bond - alternating lattice , and almost an order of magnitude higher than the ordinary 3d case of @xmath94 bandwidth .",
    "this shows that the superconductivity in the disconnected fermi surface proposed in ref . for 2d",
    "is robust against introduction of the third - direction hopping .",
    "the peak in @xmath0 at a nonzero @xmath11 ( rather than at @xmath81 ) seen above is surprising .",
    "this is particularly puzzling since the spin susceptibility increases monotonically with @xmath11 , which implies that a good nesting _ per se _ does not necessarily favor the pairing .",
    "we then want to pin - point the physical reason why superconductivity is degraded although @xmath78 increases in the region of @xmath95 .",
    "to elaborate the question let us look at another , similar phenomenon when we increase the in - plane , inter - ladder hopping , @xmath17 , with a fixed @xmath96 in fig .",
    "there , we can see that , although the nesting , in the direction of @xmath86 , evolves with @xmath17 as shown from both the shape of the fermi surface and the value of @xmath78 in fig .",
    "[ e ] , @xmath46 decreases as @xmath78 increases , which provides another example of the degraded superconductivity in the evolution of the nesting .",
    "we can conceive several reasons as follows .",
    "as we have mentioned , the increase of @xmath11 or @xmath54 raises the dimensionality of the anisotropic system to 3d .",
    "this should degrade superconductivity in two ways .",
    "first one is just the mechanism revealed by arita _",
    "_ in ref.@xcite , where higher the dimension smaller the phase volume fraction for the pairing interaction . secondly , when @xmath97 is close to band edges , the density of states there tends to be smaller for higher dimensions . to see that this is indeed the case , we have examined in figs.[d],[f ] the regions in @xmath38-space in which @xmath98 which we will refer to as the `` thickness '' of the fermi surface",
    "bulkier the thickness larger the density of states , but we specifically take the energy window @xmath99 as the energy interval over which @xmath100 ( with @xmath101 being the momentum that gives the peak in @xmath78 ) , displayed in fig.[imchi ] , is significant . in other words , @xmath99 is the energy scale of the spin fluctuations that mediate the pairing . as seen in figs .",
    "[ d],[f ] , respectively , increased @xmath11 or @xmath54 makes the fermi surface",
    " thinner \" although the fermi surface itself is large .",
    "the situation is shown schematically in fig.[cont ]    another factor governing superconductivity can also be identified from figs.[d],[f ] .",
    "namely , since we are here dealing with small ( or vanishing ) fermi surfaces , the spin susceptibility is governed not by the shape of the fermi surface itself , but by the thickened fermi surface .",
    "the thin fermi surfaces for smaller @xmath11 or @xmath54 then make the nesting sharper and the peak in @xmath102 becomes narrower .",
    "this also acts to degrade superconductivity , since the spin susceptibility has to be appropriately `` blurred '' in order to make the spin fluctuation usable over a large phase space for pair scattering .",
    "we have studied how the pairing with higher @xmath0 in disconnected fermi surfaces can be realized in three - dimensional systems .",
    "our first proposal of the stacked bond - alternating lattice has a pair of ball - like fermi pockets with a dominant inter - band nesting vector and antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations , which is a genuinely 3d model in that the interlayer hopping @xmath11 promotes the inter - band pairing . @xmath0",
    "estimated from eliashberg s equation shows that @xmath103 times the bandwidth ( @xmath104 ) , which is as high as that for the single - band hubbard model on the square lattice , and remarkably high for 3d system .    our second model of the stacked layers each having a disconnected fermi - surface in 2d originally proposed by kuroki and arita@xcite is shown to have a high @xmath0 that is robust against the introduction of the inter - layer hopping , although the hopping degrades the 2d nesting .",
    "the estimated @xmath105 several times @xmath106 bandwidth ( @xmath107 several times @xmath1 ) is even higher than the first model .    from these",
    "we have then identified the right conditions for higher @xmath0 in the disconnected fermi surface : the system should be quasi - low dimensional , and the peak in the spin susceptibility should be not too sharp but `` blurred '' .",
    "so the message here is that 3d materials with considerably high @xmath0 can be expected if we consider appropriate lattice structures .",
    "numerical calculations were performed at the computer center and the issp supercomputer center of university of tokyo . this study was in part supported by a grant - in - aid for scientific research from the ministry of education of japan .",
