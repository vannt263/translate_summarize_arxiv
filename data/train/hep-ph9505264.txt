    "the cross sections for @xmath4 and @xmath1 meson production via the @xmath5 and @xmath6 reactions , at energies near their respective thresholds , exhibit a pronounced energy dependence which deviates strongly from phase space@xcite .",
    "such deviations , which occur in other hadronic collisions as well@xcite , are most certainly due to final state interactions(@xmath7 ) between the reaction products . while @xmath7 corrections due to the short range nucleon - nucleon(@xmath8 ) force between the outgoing protons seem adequate to reproduce the observed energy dependence@xcite and the cross section scale@xcite for pion production , they fail to do so for the @xmath1 production@xcite .",
    "particularly , several model calculations@xcite have considered the @xmath9 through a perturbative approach but none of them reproduced the energy dependence near threshold , although @xmath7 corrections were made to account for the proton - proton interaction .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to show that while the meson - nucleon interaction influences s - wave pion production only slightly , its effects are crucial for reproducing the energy dependence of the @xmath6 reaction .",
    "there exists no theory of final state effects in the presence of three strongly interacting particles and our first objective will be to develop a procedure that accounts for both the @xmath8 and meson-@xmath10 forces . to accomplish this task we consider a production process , @xmath11 .",
    "a full dynamical theory of such a process would require the solution of two and three - body scattering problems .",
    "particularly , in the faddeev formalism@xcite the full transition amplitude is decomposed as a sum of three terms depending on which of the three final particle pairs interacts last .",
    "the evaluation of these terms , the so called faddeev amplitudes , requires the solution of a set of coupled integral equations .",
    "such a procedure should resolve the problem at hand but , in view of the scarcity of knowledge about the @xmath12 interaction it may turn to be unreliable and rather long and tedious to apply . in what follows",
    "we develop an approximation along exactly the lines of the watson s",
    "approach@xcite for two body reactions , @xmath13 , we look for a separation of the energy dependence due to @xmath7 from those of the primary production amplitude .",
    "such an approximation may prove useful and easy to apply in analyzing near threshold meson production data from @xmath8 scattering .    according to the watson - migdal @xmath7 theory for two body processes@xcite ,",
    "the energy dependence of the full transition amplitude is governed by rescattering of final state particles .",
    "the full transition amplitude is approximated by , @xmath14 where the primary production amplitude , @xmath15 , is assumed to be a smooth and slowly varying function of energy and @xmath16 is taken as the @xmath17 two - body elastic scattering amplitude in the exit channel .",
    "thus the energy dependence of the full matrix element is determined mostly by @xmath16 . a decomposition as such of the amplitude into a primary production amplitude and a subsequent @xmath7 correction term is meaningful only if @xmath16 is sufficiently large so that dominate the reaction amplitude .",
    "this requires that the distortion of the final state wave function ( the deviation from a simple product of free particle wave functions ) or alternatively , the @xmath18 ( the probability of the particles to find each other s vicinity ) in itself be proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "albeit , the particles spend a great deal of time close together , as should be the case in particle production processes close to threshold .",
    "otherwise , the distortion factor of the final state ( and obviously the full matrix element ) must be calculated by using more precise methods@xcite .",
    "the complete transition amplitude of a production process can be decomposed in the form shown in fig .",
    "1 , where the first term ( the block @xmath19 ) represents the primary production amplitude which includes all possible inelastic transitions contributing to the process , while all other terms represent the contributions from rescatterings in the entrance and exit channels ( the and blocks ) . the third term , for example , corresponds to a process in which the primary production takes place as if there were no @xmath7 and only subsequently is distorted by the coulomb and nuclear short range interactions between the reaction products . at energies near the reaction threshold , where the relative energies of particle pairs in the final state are sufficiently small and corrections",
    "are dominating , such a term is expected to be more important than others . in analogy",
    "to the watson - migdal approximation we make the @xmath20 that in the limit of weak and strong , the transition amplitude of a three - body reaction can be approximated by an expression similar to eqn .",
    "1 , with the correction term being replaced by the on mass - shell @xmath21 scattering amplitude of a @xmath0 ( three particles in to three particles out ) transition .",
    "this amplitude is denoted by @xmath22 and , can be evaluated using the faddeev formalism@xcite or others such as the weinberg method@xcite .",
    "certainly , it is not a measurable quantity as such a @xmath0 transition is not easy to realize experimentally .",
    "it is shown in sect . 2 though , that at energies near particle production threshold , @xmath22 can be estimated from two - body scattering data without having to solve the full three - body dynamics .    within this approximation ,",
    "the transition amplitude of a three - body reaction is coherent in terms of the interactions between the various final particle pairs , just as one anticipates based on general quantum mechanical considerations@xcite .",
    "thus the effects due to a given pair s interaction is distributed over the entire transition amplitude and may influence strongly the energy dependence of the cross section . in sect .",
    "3 we apply the procedure developed to production of mesons in @xmath8 scattering and show that although the @xmath23 interaction is rather weak with respect to the @xmath8 interaction it makes remarkably strong contributions .",
    "discussion of the results and conclusions are given in sect .",
    "prior to extending the watson - migdal approximation to three - body reactions let us recall first the more familiar problem of corrections in two - body reactions .",
    "assume that the full interaction between particles separates into @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 stand for weak and strong terms respectively .",
    "here @xmath25 is the primary interaction , such that if it were zero , the process in question would not occur .",
    "the remaining part of the interaction @xmath26 is responsible for rescatterings in the entrance and exit channels .",
    "we further assume that @xmath26 is the only strong channel energetically allowed .",
    "we would like to find how @xmath7 affects the transition amplitude in a process in which the primary interaction is relatively weak .",
    "the full transition amplitude in an appropriate eigenchannel is defined as , @xmath27 where @xmath28 are two - particle scattering wave functions .",
    "they correspond to solutions of the equation with a hamiltonian that contains strong @xmath26-interactions only and satisfy the boundary conditions that @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) tends asymptotically to free two - particle wave function @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , plus outgoing ( ingoing ) spherical waves .",
    "these can be written in the form@xcite , @xmath33\\   \\phi_{0\\lambda } \\ \\ , \\lambda = i,\\ f\\ \\ . \\label{eq:22}\\ ] ] here @xmath34 is a free two - body green s functions , and @xmath35 and @xmath16 are two - body elastic scattering amplitude for the entrance and exit channels , respectively .",
    "substituting eqn .",
    "3 in 2 leads to the full transition amplitude , @xmath36 note that this expression is exact and contains both and . in the watson - migdal approximation , @xmath37 where the two overlapping integrals @xmath38 and @xmath39 are on mass - shell @xmath40 matrix elements which contain and corrections , respectively . to cast the amplitude , eqn . 5 , in the form given by the watson s approximation , eqn . 1",
    ", one has to replace @xmath29 by @xmath41 so that @xmath42 is equal to unity and , in the limit of extremely strong , take the on mass - shell @xmath16 instead of the @xmath43 matrix elements",
    ".    it would be instructive to repeat these arguments using a diagrammatic language .",
    "we associate the weak primary interaction @xmath25 with the diagram @xmath44 , and the strong @xmath26 interaction with the diagram 2b of figure 2 . as usual the disconnected diagram @xmath45 describes noninteracting particles .",
    "it is evident that the amplitude @xmath46 is the sum of all diagrams that can be constructed from the elementary diagrams @xmath44 and @xmath47 . to single out the and blocks and obtain the full matrix element in a diagrammatic representation similar to the one of fig . 1 ,",
    "we first sum in the initial and final channels all diagrams that contain strong interactions only ( see fig .",
    "these sums yield the elastic amplitudes @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) which we identify with the appropriate and blocks , respectively .",
    "the sum of all diagrams that start or end with a weak interaction ( diagram @xmath44 ) forms the block @xmath19 which describes the @xmath50 production process .",
    "when rescatterings in both of the initial and final states give sufficiently large amplitudes , the migdal - watson ideology tells us that the 4th term on the rhs of eqn . 4 is dominating",
    ". when @xmath7 ( @xmath51 ) effects are small , then the second ( third ) term dominates .",
    "thus the @xmath51 and @xmath7 effects can be separated from the full transition amplitude by summing diagrams in a specific order and subsequently derive the watson - migdal approximation by selecting an appropriate dominant term in the limit of extremely weak and extremely strong .",
    "we apply this same reasoning to obtain the watson - migdal approximation for three - body reactions .",
    "let @xmath52 be the transition amplitude of a production process in which an initial two - body process goes into a final three - body state .",
    "for conciseness assume all particles to be distinguishable and spinless .",
    "this restriction simplifies the mathematics but can be easily removed to treat more general cases .",
    "furthermore , assume that each pair in the three - body final state has a given angular momentum so that a unique elastic scattering state is assigned to each pair simultaneously .",
    "this is very often the case at energies near threshold where , only one partial wave dominates for each pair namely , @xmath53 . following the discussion given above for two - body reactions",
    "the interactions are divided into two categories : ( i ) elastic interactions leading to rearrangement of particle ( inner ) quantum numbers but not to the production of any additional hadrons , ( ii ) inelastic interactions which are responsible for the production ( or annihilation ) of particles so that particle numbers in the initial and final states are different .",
    "likewise , we call elastic those diagrams which involve elastic interactions only and having equal number of legs to the left hand and to the right hand sides .",
    "those which begin and end with inelastic interactions and having different number of legs to the left and right hand sides are called inelastic .    the transition amplitude @xmath52 of the reaction under considerations is the sum of all diagrams which start with two legs on the left and end with three legs on the right , that can be assembled using all possible elastic and inelastic diagrams .",
    "to decompose @xmath52 into four terms as depicted in fig .",
    "1 , these diagrams need be organized in a specific order before suming them . first note that by summing all two - particle elastic diagrams in the entrance channel and all three - particle elastic diagrams in the exit channel , one obtains the @xmath54 and @xmath0 @xmath21 transition amplitude of fig .",
    "these elastic amplitudes which are denoted by @xmath55 and @xmath22 , contain only elastic interactions and as such , they are only parts of the complete @xmath54 and @xmath0 amplitudes .",
    "although at energies above particle production threshold , two and three - particle channels may well be opened in both the initial and final states , these two amplitudes are calculated by taking into account only elastic interactions .",
    "all inelastic and quasi - elastic processes are confined into @xmath19 .",
    "note also , that the @xmath56 elastic block contains connected diagrams only but , the @xmath0 block contains disconnected diagrams as well ( see fig .",
    "the set of all diagrams contributing to the entire transition amplitude @xmath52 , is now separated into four partial sums each corresponding to one of the terms in the block diagram of fig . 1 : ( i ) the block @xmath19 is the sum of all inelastic diagrams only , ( ii ) the -@xmath19 term is the sum of all diagrams which start with a @xmath54 elastic diagram on the left and end with an inelastic diagram on the right , ( iii ) the @xmath19-term is the sum of all diagrams which start with an inelastic diagram on the left and end with a @xmath0 elastic diagram to the right and , ( iv ) the -@xmath19-term is the sum of all diagrams which start with a @xmath54 elastic diagram on the left and end with a @xmath57 elastic diagram on the right . obviously , these four partial sums exhaust the entire set of diagrams that may contribute to the complete transition amplitude .",
    "this same presentation of @xmath52 as the sum of the terms of fig .",
    "1 can as well be derived formally . by definition ,",
    "the transition amplitude is , @xmath58 where as defined in eqn .",
    "3 , @xmath59 stands for a two - body elastic scattering wave function and @xmath60 is a three - particle elastic scattering wave function corresponding to the exit channel .",
    "it is a solution of a three - body schr@xmath61dinger equation with a hamiltonian having only two - body and three - body elastic interactions , and satisfies the boundary conditions that @xmath60 tends asymptotically to a free three - particle wave function , @xmath62 , plus outgoing spherical waves . in terms of the elastic scattering amplitudes defined above one has the expression@xcite , @xmath63\\ \\phi_{03}\\ \\ . \\label{eq:222}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using this with eqn . 3 in eqn . 6",
    "implies that , @xmath64 formally , this expression provides an exact solution of the problem and has a structure identical in form to that given in eqn .",
    "4 , for two - body reactions .",
    "a notable feature of this expression is that all inelastic transitions are confined in the block @xmath19 , while all possible @xmath21 rescatterings in the entrance and exit channels are contained in @xmath55 and @xmath22 .",
    "let us now consider corrections @xmath65 . in the limit of extremely weak one may replace @xmath59 by @xmath66 in eqn .",
    "6 . this makes the second and fourth terms on the rhs of eqn .",
    "8 disappear .",
    "furthermore , in the limit of very strong the third term on the rhs of eqn .",
    "8 dominates and we may approximate the transition amplitude by , @xmath67 we may argue that the matrix element @xmath68 is a smooth and slowly varying function of the energy and momenta and hence the energy dependence of the amplitude , eqn .",
    "9 , is determined almost solely by the elastic amplitude @xmath22 .",
    "although in form eqn .",
    "9 resembles the watson - migdal approximation for two - body reactions , eqn .",
    "1 , there exists an essential difference between the two cases which makes eqn .",
    "9 more difficult to apply .",
    "this is because the amplitude @xmath22 , contrary to @xmath16 , is practically not a measurable quantity .",
    "the two - body initial state , @xmath69 , can be calculated using distorted wave approach and the effects of slowly varying nonvanishing can be included by replacing @xmath19 in eqn . 9 with the matrix element @xmath70 . with this modification in mind eqn .",
    "9 is more suitable to apply to data .",
    "certainly , must be included in a full dynamical description of the process as they influence the cross section scale through the matrix element @xmath19 .      in the faddeev formalism @xmath22",
    "is written as a sum of three faddeev amplitudes , @xmath71 these satisfy the set of coupled integral equations@xcite , @xmath72\\ \\ , \\label{eq:8}\\ ] ] where we have used the notation , @xmath73 and final particles are labeled 1,2 and 3 . here",
    "@xmath74 are two - body scattering amplitudes in the three - body space . in momentum space and adopt the convention that ( @xmath75 ) are always cyclic , @xmath76 with @xmath77 being a solution of the ordinary two - body lippmann - schwinger equation of the energy variable @xmath78 .",
    "e is the total three - body energy and @xmath79 the energy appropriate to momentum @xmath80 . from the definitions in eqn .",

    "14 , @xmath82 is the sum of all terms contributing to @xmath22 which end with @xmath74 but , it does not include all contributions of the @xmath83 interaction .",
    "note that the first term on the rhs represents the @xmath83 two - body scattering amplitude with the @xmath84th particle being a spectator and as such it corresponds to a disconnected diagram . in the center of mass of the @xmath83 pair and for a given partial wave @xmath85",
    ", @xmath74 has the elastic scattering phase @xmath86 . the second term in eqn .",

    "these play an important role in the coherence formalism@xcite through interference with similar terms involving the @xmath87 and @xmath88 pair interactions .",
    "therefore , in order to account for the effects of any pair s interaction the entire amplitude must be constructed . adding the sum ( @xmath89 ) to @xmath82 of eqn .",
    "14 , one obtains three equivalent forms of the entire amplitude , @xmath90\\ , \\",

    "the entire amplitude have the phase @xmath93(j ) . for this to happen ,",
    "say in a region where the expression @xmath94 may vary rapidly with energy it must have a part which cancels the variation of @xmath95 so as to give to their sum the behaviour of @xmath74 .",
    "this general observation on three - body amplitudes , which is true for @xmath52 as well as for @xmath96 , has far reaching consequences on the energy dependence of the entire amplitude .",
    "certainly , in order to take this cancelation into account the terms corresponding to completely connected diagrams must be included .",
    "another general constraint on the form of @xmath52 is provided by the so called fermi - watson theorem .",
    "this requires that the phase of the transition amplitude of the entire amplitude is determined by the phases and norms of the rescattering amplitudes in the entrance and exit channel and that in the limit of vanishing the overall phase of the entire amplitude is equal to that of the elastic scattering amplitude in the exit channel .",
    "this well established for two - body reactions@xcite is easily extended to the case of three - body reactions near threshold ( see appendix a ) .",
    "explicitly , for the case under considerations , this theorem requires that the phase of @xmath52 must be identical to the overall phase of @xmath22 .",
    "both of these constraints are satisfied by the approximation , eqn .",
    "9 , in a natural way .",
    "turning now to estimate the rescattering amplitude , we note first that the kernel @xmath97 is compact for any complex e and therefore eqns .",

    "3b . the first three of these are disconnected and represent the contributions of the free @xmath99 .",
    "as shown by amado@xcite and cahill@xcite taking the sum of just these three diagrams would not yield a coherent amplitude and therefore would not be a satisfactory solution .",
    "the other diagrams of fig .",
    "3b give the first order correction due to two subsequent elastic scatterings , they are all completely connected and as indicated above play an important role in the coherence mechanism@xcite .",
    "the next iteration introduces connected diagrams with three and four rescatterings and so on .",
    "summing the contributions of diagrams up to the corresponding order leads , in principio , to @xmath22 with the accuracy required .    as a first step",
    "we restrict the following discussion to corrections due to one and two rescattering diagrams only ( fig . 3b ) , , we calculate @xmath22 to first order only . denoting contributions from double scattering diagrams by @xmath100",
    "it is shown in appendix b that for s - wave production at energies close to threshold , @xmath101 where @xmath102 are integrals of kowalski - noyes@xcite half - shell functions over the appropriate relative momenta of the interacting pairs .",
    "thus the entire transition amplitude can be written as , @xmath103 where the correction factor is given by ,    @xmath104    a further simplification can be achieved by setting all @xmath102 equal unity , thus neglecting off shell effects ( see appendix b ) .",
    "this allows calculating the factor from two - body scattering data of the particles involved . to evaluate @xmath22 to second order we need to include @xmath105 $ ] terms .",
    "the evaluation of such terms is described in appendix c , where it is shown that the effect of the ( ff ) factor is to scale the first order amplitude @xmath106 $ ] by , @xmath107 here we have used the standard parameterization , @xmath108 with the @xmath109 s being the appropriate s - wave phase shifts .",

    "our predictions with the full correction factor ( solid curve ) agrees slightly better with data compared with those obtained by including the @xmath8 force only ( dashed line ) . nonetheless , even in this case , where the overall meson - nucleon interaction is weak , the effects from disconnected and completely connected diagrams are comparable .",
    "it is our contention that the completely connected diagrams of fig .",
    "3b must be included if one wishes to interpret the recent precision measurements of @xmath113 production cross section@xcite . as demonstrated below the importance of these completely connected diagrams",
    "becomes more apparent in applying our procedure to @xmath1 production .    for @xmath1 meson production",

    "the factor calculated to first order are shown in fig .",
    "6 . here as for pion production , the solution with the factor calculated to second order is nearly identical .",
    "in contrast with @xmath113 production , this process is strongly influenced by the @xmath12 interaction giving rise to a sharp enhancement of the cross section very near threshold and thus reproduces , rather accurately , the energy dependence of the cross section up to @xmath138 .",
    "note also , that in the analysis presented above , the enhancement factor @xmath129 is exactly what is required to keep the primary production amplitude nearly constant over the energy range from threshold to @xmath138 .",
    "it is interesting to explore how sensitive the results are for a different choice of the @xmath137 scattering length . since other channels such as the @xmath139",
    "are also opened , wilkin@xcite has fixed the imaginary part to be @xmath140 = 0.30 fm$ ] and used the @xmath141 data directly to determine the real part .",

    "calculations with this value are given in fig .",
    "the energy dependence is mostly sensitive to the real part of @xmath137 and the results from our analysis do not support the @xmath143 value proposed by wilkin@xcite .",
    "it is to be noted also , that based on partial wave unitarity relations , an analysis of the @xmath144 backward differential cross section data yields a value of @xmath145 for the phase of the @xmath12 production amplitude@xcite a value in agreement with bhalerao and liu@xcite but not with wilkin@xcite .",
    "in summary we have developed an approximate procedure which accounts for final state effects in the presence of three strongly interacting particles . in analogy with the watson s",
    "treatment@xcite it was shown that , in the the limit of extremely strong the amplitude factorizes into a primary production amplitude and an elastic scattering amplitude describing a @xmath0 transition .",
    "the energy dependence of the cross section in the near vicinity of the reaction threshold is determined almost entirely by @xmath22 .",
    "based on the coherence formalism of amado@xcite we argue that the completely connected diagrams corresponding to two rescatterings may interfere strongly and therefore , play an important role in determining the energy dependence of the cross section . in view of the scarcity of knowledge about the meson - nucleon force , the approximation is particularly useful near threshold where @xmath22 can be estimated using nucleon - nucleon and meson - nucleon scattering data . because of the strong nn force the term dominates .",
    "detailed analysis of @xmath113 and @xmath1 production via @xmath8 collisions show that the energy dependence of the cross section can be explained in both cases , by taking into account the meson-@xmath10 interaction also .",
    "in the present analysis we have not considered corrections as these vary slowly with energy and would have little influence on the energy dependence . for @xmath8 scattering at bombarding energies of several 100 mev and above",

    "the gamov factor which accounts for coulomb distortions is equal unity within 2.5@xmath146 even for the pion data analyzed above . as previously mentioned effects can be included exactly by using distorted waves for the incoming two - proton state .",
    "finally , the primary production amplitude is not treated explicitly so that the cross section scale was arbitrary .",
    "this deficiency can be removed by incorporating in eqn .",
    "17 a primary production amplitude from one of the existing perturbative models@xcite .",
    "such model calculations were performed for @xmath1 production , taking the @xmath1n interaction in the primary amplitude to be consistent with that occurring in the .",
