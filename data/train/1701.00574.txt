    "exploring the qcd phase transition is one of the main interests in current heavy - ion physics .",
    "calculations from lattice qcd have shown that the transition from hadronic matter to quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is a crossover  @xcite at vanishing baryon chemical potential ( @xmath2 ) , while a first - order phase transition is expected for finite baryon chemical potentials  @xcite .",
    "the first - order phase transition of qcd matter is related to the existence of a `` softest point '' in the equation of state ( eos ) , where the `` softest point '' in the eos represents a local minimum of the ratio of the pressure to the energy density @xmath3 as a function of energy density @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the collective flows have been frequently used to explore the properties of hot and dense matter  @xcite , since , it can reflect the properties of the matter created in early stages of heavy - ion collisions and is expected to be sensitive to the eos .",
    "hydrodynamical calculations show the minimum in the excitation function of the directed flow around the softest point of the eos , and this collapse of the directed flow is proposed as a possible signal of a first - order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "elliptic flow is also one of the most important observables which measures the momentum anisotropy of produced particles . in relativistic heavy - ion collisions at finite impact parameters ,",
    "the particle momentum distribution measured with respect to the reaction plane is not isotropic and it is usually expanded in a fourier series @xcite : @xmath5,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the emission azimuthal angle of the particles and @xmath7 is the reaction plane angle .",
    "the flow coefficients @xmath8 are a quantitative characterization of the event anisotropy , where the symbol @xmath9 indicates an average over all particles and all events .",
    "elliptic flow parameter is defined as the second fourier coefficient @xmath10 of the particle momentum distributions and it can be expressed as @xmath11 where , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the @xmath14 ( the impact parameter direction on the reaction plane ) , and @xmath15 ( the direction perpendicular to the reaction plane ) components of the particle momenta , respectively .",
    "elliptic flow is expected to arise out of the pressure gradient and subsequent interactions among the constituents in non - zero impact parameter collisions .",
    "thus it provides a plenty of information about the early - time thermalization and it is a good tool to study the system formed in the early stages of high - energy nuclear collisions  @xcite .",
    "the elliptic flow is one of the most extensively studied observables in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the elliptic flow as a function of transverse momentum ( @xmath16 ) , pseudorapidity ( @xmath17 ) , and centrality",
    "have been widely measured at different experiments in these decades  @xcite .",
    "transport theoretical models are used to analyze the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "although , the characteristics of @xmath10 at high incident energies have been extensively investigated where one expects the creation of almost baryon free qgp , it is also of great interest to perform a corresponding research for high baryon density regions , and new experiments are planned such as bes ii at rhic  @xcite , fair  @xcite , j - parc  @xcite , and nica  @xcite . in this work , we utilized a microscopic transport model jam  @xcite to systematically study the centrality , transverse momentum and pseudo - rapidity dependence of @xmath10 in au+au collision at @xmath1 gev , which is the top center of mass energy of compress baryonc matter ( cbm ) at sis100  @xcite heavy - ion collision experiment at fair . in the following , we shall investigate the effects of the mean field potential and the softening of eos on the elliptic flow by employing the jam transport model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we provide a brief description of the jam model based on which our studies were carried out .",
    "then , we present our results on the centrality , transverse momentum and pseudorapidity distributions of elliptic flow of charged hadrons as well as protons , pions , kaons and their corresponding anti - particles in section iii . finally , a summary of our work will be given in sec .",
    "several microscopic transport models , such as rqmd @xcite , urqmd @xcite , ampt @xcite , phsd  @xcite , and jam  @xcite , have been frequently used to explore ( ultra- ) relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "jam ( jet aa microscopic transport model ) has been developed based on resonance and string degrees of freedom @xcite similar to the rqmd and urqmd models , in order to simulate ( ultra- ) relativistic nuclear collisions from initial stages of reaction to final state interactions in hadronic gas stage . in jam",
    ", particles are produced via the resonance or string formations followed by their decays .",
    "hadrons and their excited states are explicitly propagated in space - time by the cascade method  @xcite .",
    "we study the effect of hadronic mean - field potentials on elliptic flow by employing the jam mean - field mode in which hadronic mean - field potentials are implemented based on the framework of the simplified version of the relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( rqmd / s )  @xcite .",
    "the skyrme type density dependent and lorentzian - type momentum dependent mean - field potentials  @xcite for baryons are adopted in the rqmd / s approach and the single - particle potential @xmath18 has the form @xmath19",

    "the parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we also study the effect of the softening of eos on elliptic flow by the method of choosing attractive orbit in two - body scattering  @xcite .",
    "it is well known from the virial theorem  @xcite that attractive orbits in each two - body hadron - hadron scattering reduce the pressure of the system .",
    "we now present the jam results for the centrality , transverse momentum and pseudorapidity dependence of @xmath10 in au+au collision at @xmath1 gev .",
    "the collisions centrality is defined by the charged particle multiplicity within @xmath28 .",
    "( @xmath29 ) integrated @xmath0 of charged hadrons as a function of collision centrality in au+au collisions at @xmath1 gev from the standard jam cascade ( circles ) , jam with mean - field ( squares ) , and jam with attractive orbit ( crosses ) . ]",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the centrality dependence of charged hadron @xmath0 at mid - rapidity ( @xmath28 ) in au+au collisions at @xmath30= 5 gev . as we can see , the magnitude of the elliptic flow @xmath10 in semi - central collisions ( 20 - 30% ) is the largest for all three modes , which are the cascade , mean - field and attractive orbit , respectively .",
    "the general trend of @xmath10 versus centrality for the mean - field and attractive orbit mode is similar to the cascade mode predictions .",
    "we observe that the mean - field reduces the values of charged hadron @xmath10 compared to the cascade mode as consistent with the previous studies by transport models  @xcite , while the attractive orbits enhance the elliptic flow of charged hadrons . in the case of the mean - filed mode ,",
    "higher pressures are generated in the system due to the repulsive interactions which accelerate the expansion of the participant matter . as a result ,",
    "spectator matters squeeze participant matter out - of - plane more than the cascade mode which leads to the suppression of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "we note that recently different mechanism of the generation of negative @xmath0 has been proposed at lower beam energies around @xmath31 agev within the qmd approach  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the pressure is significantly reduced in the case of attractive orbit mode .",
    "consequently , participant matter may expand much slower which reduces the interactions with the spectator matters that results in the strong in - plane emission .",
    "this might be the reason why we see the enhancement of @xmath0 in the attractive orbit mode .",
    "the @xmath17 ( @xmath29 ) integrated @xmath10 as a function of collision centrality in au+au collisions at @xmath1 gev from jam cascade model ( circles ) , jam cascade with mean - field ( squares ) , and jam cascade with attractive orbit ( crosses ) .",
    "the left and right panels show the results for identified particles ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) and corresponding antiparticles ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) , respectively . ]    to gain more information about the effects of mean field and the softening of eos on the elliptic flow , we study the elliptic flow of identified hadrons ( proton , pion and kaon ) and their anti - particles .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we show the centrality dependence of @xmath0 for particles ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) and corresponding antiparticles ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) in au+au collisions at @xmath1 gev from the jam model in the three different modes .",
    "we observe that the magnitude of the @xmath10 from the mean - field mode is smaller than the results from the cascade mode for all particle species . on the other hand , @xmath10 calculated from the attractive orbit mode show larger values for pion and kaon compared to the cascade mode , but proton @xmath0 is similar to the cascade mode .",
    "thus , the enhancement of charged hadron @xmath0 in the attractive orbit mode observed in fig .  [ fig:1 ] comes mainly from the changes of pion and kaon flows .",
    "we note that the jam mean - filed result for @xmath0 seems to be in good agreement with the experimental data from the top ags energy @xmath38 gev  @xcite",
    ".    experimentally , the measured antiparticle @xmath10 is lower than the corresponding particle @xmath10 and the difference in @xmath10 between particles and their antiparticles should increase with decreasing beam energy  @xcite .",
    "however , jam predicts that the values of @xmath10 for particles are similar to the results of their antiparticles .",
    "the similarity of the values of @xmath0 between particles and their anti - particles in jam may be due to the scalar type baryonic mean - field potentials implemented for all baryons , and no mean - field for pions and kaons . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is found that the different mean - field potentials among particles and their anti - particles in the hadronic as well as partonic phases improve the description of the data on the difference of @xmath0 between particles and their anti - particles observed in the star beam energy scan ( bes ) program .",

    "the results of the jam model for particles and antiparticles show a similar decreasing trend of @xmath10 with increase in @xmath40 .",
    "we observe that the values of @xmath10 for pions and kaons from the attractive orbit mode are larger than those from the cascade mode , while @xmath0 for protons is similar to the cascade mode prediction .",
    "the @xmath10 from mean - filed mode is always smaller than the results from the cascade and attractive orbit modes for all the particles .    in figure",
    "[ fig:4 ] , we show @xmath0 for identified particles as a function of the transverse momentum @xmath39 for @xmath29 in 20 - 40% mid - central au+au collisions at @xmath30= 5 gev .",
    "the results from three different modes show a similar transverse momentum dependence in @xmath41 .",
    "it is also seen that the proton and anti - proton @xmath41 from jam standard cascade and jam with attractive orbit modes are similar for all @xmath39 range .",
    "the results of @xmath41 from the cascade and attractive orbit mode are larger than the result from jam with the mean - field mode .",
    "although the statistical error on the anti - protons is relatively large , the general increasing trend of anti - proton @xmath42 with increasing @xmath16 is still obvious .",
    "the difference in @xmath42 between the particles and corresponding antiparticles from jam is small as expected from the integrated @xmath0 results .",
    "we have studied the effects of the hadronic mean - field and the softening of the eos on the elliptic flow in au+au collision at @xmath1 gev within the jam model .",
    "the calculations of @xmath10 as a function of centrality , pseudo - rapidity and transverse momentum are performed with three different modes , which are cascade , mean - field , and attractive orbit , respectively .",
    "we found that the results calculated in three different modes have a similar trend in centrality , pseudo - rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , we have observed that the value of @xmath10 from the attractive orbit mode is larger than the one from the cascade mode , while the mean - filed mode yields less @xmath10 in comparison to the result calculated from the cascade mode .",

    ". the magnitude of @xmath0 from the jam model for identified particles are similar to those for their antiparticles .",
    "our results indicate a high sensitivity of the elliptic flow on the pressure of the system .",
    "hadronic mean - field generates more pressure which leads to stronger squeeze - out effect . on the other hand ,",
    "the enhancement of the elliptic flow is predicted for the attractive orbit mode which leads to the softening of the eos .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath0 may be due to a slowing down of the expansion of the participant matter .",
    "thus our results suggest that the enhancement of the elliptic flow in au+au collision at highest baryon density region may be used as a signal of a first - order phase transition . for the further investigations in this direction , a study of the eos dependence of the elliptic flow by the transport approach with the eos modified collision term  @xcite may provide a useful information .",
