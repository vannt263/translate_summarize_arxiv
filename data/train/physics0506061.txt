    "atomic ions trapped in an electrodynamic cage allow for preparation and measurement of individual quantum systems , and represent an ideal system to investigate fundamental questions of quantum physics , for instance , related to decoherence @xcite , the measurement process @xcite , or multiparticle entanglement @xcite . also , trapped ions satisfy all criteria necessary for quantum computing .",
    "two internal states of each ion represent one elementary quantum mechanical unit of information ( a qubit ) .",
    "the quantized vibrational motion of the ions ( the `` bus - qubit '' ) is used as means of communication between individual qubits to implement conditional quantum dynamics with two or more qubits @xcite . in recent experiments quantum logic operations with two trapped ions were realized  @xcite and teleportation of an atomic state has been demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "these implementations of quantum information processing ( qip ) with trapped ions require that the ion string is cooled to low vibrational collective excitations @xcite .",
    "in particular , this condition should be fulfilled by _ all _ collective vibrational modes  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in view of the issue of scalable qip with ion traps , it is important to find efficient cooling schemes that allow to prepare vibrationally cold ion chains .",
    "cooling of the vibrational motion of two ions in a common trap potential has been demonstrated experimentally  @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "this is deemed to be sufficient for a quantum information processor which utilizes two ions _ at a time _ for quantum logic operations with additional ions stored in spatially separated regions @xcite . if more than two ions reside in a common trap potential and shall be used simultaneously for quantum logic operations , however , the task of reducing the ions motional thermal excitation becomes increasingly challenging with a growing number of ions and represents a severe obstacle on the way towards scalable qip with an ion chain .",
    "straightforward extensions of laser - cooling schemes for one particle to many ions , like sequentially applying sideband cooling  @xcite to each one of the modes , becomes inefficient as the number of ions increases , since after having cooled the last mode , the first one may already be considerably affected by heating due to photon scattering and/or due to fluctuations of the trap potential .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to find a method that allows for simultaneous and efficient cooling of many vibrational modes of a chain of ions .    in this article",
    "we propose a scheme that allows for simultaneous sideband cooling of all collective modes of an ion chain to the ground state .",
    "this is achieved by inducing position dependent zeeman shifts through a suitably designed magnetic field , thereby shifting the spectrum of each ion in such a way that the red - sideband transitions of each mode may occur at the same frequency .",
    "thus , by irradiating the ion string with monochromatic radiation all axial modes are cooled .",
    "we investigate numerically the efficiency and explore implementations of simultaneous sideband excitation by means of laser light , and alternatively , by using long - wavelength radiation in the radio - frequency or microwave regime  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows : in section [ introscheme ] the cooling scheme is outlined .",

    "it occurs , for instance , that the largest axial excitations couple weakly to the ions at the edges of the ion string , instead they are mainly characterized by oscillations of ions in the center of the chain  @xcite .",
    "a manifestation of this behavior is the small value of the matrix element @xmath171 .",

    "the cooling rate is maximal for that particular mode ( i.e. , each grey bar corresponds to a different detuning ) .    for the case of mode 10",
    "the difference between the cooling rates depending on which ion is addressed is particularly striking : the cooling rate of mode 10 at detuning @xmath172 ( black bar ) is very small , as noted above , whereas the optimal rate @xmath173s@xmath123 ( given the parameters used here ) is achieved at @xmath174 . at this detuning ion 6 is used for cooling mode 10 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ scheme ] .",

    "then , we apply radiation with @xmath117 ( cooling rates indicated by black bars in fig .  [ cool_wb ] ) .",

    "give an upper limit for the tolerable trap heating rate of mode 10 for the cases of sequential and simultaneous cooling , respectively .",

    "so far we have stated the general conditions that have to be met in order to efficiently cool an ion chain with sequential cooling and with a scheme combining simultaneous and sequential sideband cooling . in this section",
    "we discuss their efficiencies .",
    "we note that when using sequential sideband cooling , one may utilize all ions in the chain in order to cool one mode , where the cooling rates of each ion add up incoherently . in the case of simultaneous sideband cooling , on the other hand",
    ", only one ion is employed in order to cool a particular mode .",
    "assuming that the coupling of this ion to the mode is sufficiently large to allow for efficient cooling , the following expression for the average simultaneous cooling rate is deduced @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the cooling rate for sequential cooling averaged over all modes .",
    "thus , for simultaneous cooling relation  ( [ coolheat_sim ] ) yields @xmath187 from  ( [ g_simseq ] ) , since the total cooling rate is @xmath188 , one obtains that the efficiencies of simultaneous and sequential cooling are comparable .",
    "however , it should be remarked that this estimate corresponds to the worst case for simultaneous cooling .",
    "in fact , estimate  ( [ g_simseq ] ) is correct for long - wavelength vibrational excitations , which correspond to low - frequency axial modes , where practically all ions of the chain participate in the mode oscillation .",

    "on the basis of these qualitative considerations , one may in general state that simultaneous cooling of the chain is at least as efficient as sequential cooling . for the configuration discussed in this paper",
    "the two methods are comparable . differently from sequential cooling ,",
    "however , the efficiency of simultaneous cooling can be substantially improved by choosing a suitable magnetic field configuration that maximizes coupling of each mode to one ion of the chain .",
    "we investigate now sideband cooling of the ion chain s collective motion using microwave radiation for driving the sideband transition .",

    "this is feasible by translating into the optical domain the microwave or radio frequency that characterizes the splitting of states @xmath96 and @xmath95 . microwave or rf signals can be controlled with high precision and display low enough drift to ensure efficient cooling .",

    "the red sideband of the 5th ion corresponding to the 10th mode is driven by the raman beams ( compare fig . [ scheme ] ) .",
    "note that all other vibrational modes are also cooled at the same time .",
    "therefore , an efficient procedure for cooling _ all _ vibrational modes close to their ground state would be to first tune the raman beams such that mode 10 is optimally cooled ( i.e. , @xmath262 , fig .",
    "[ cool_3_b]d ) , and subsequently set @xmath263 ( fig .",
    "[ cool_3_b]c ) in order to simultaneously cool modes 1 through 9 .",
    "this approach is discussed in more detail in section [ simseqcooling ] .",
    "initial cooling of vibrational modes often is prerequisite for subsequent coherent manipulation of internal and motional degrees of freedom of an ion chain , for example , quantum logic operations .",
    "when implementing quantum logic operations it may not be advantageous to address all motional sidebands with a single frequency as is done here for simultaneous sideband cooling .",
    "the magnetic field gradient that superposes the sideband resonances for cooling may then be turned off adiabatically after initial raman cooling of all vibrational modes .",
    "this should be done fast enough not to allow for appreciable heating of the ion string , for example , by patch fields , and slow enough not to excite vibrational modes in the process . a lower limit for the time it takes to ramp up the gradient seems to be @xmath264 .",
    "thus , with @xmath265mhz the additional time needed to change the field gradient is negligible compared to the time needed to sideband cool the ion string which for typical parameters takes between a few hundred @xmath235s and a few ms ( compare fig .",
    "[ cool_wb ] ) .",
    "if microwave radiation is used to coherently manipulate internal and motional degrees of freedom and for quantum logic operations , it is useful not to turn off the magnetic field gradient , but instead to ramp up the field gradient to a value where all coincidences between internal and motional resonances are removed @xcite . also , a larger field gradient for quantum logic operations is desirable in this case to have stronger coupling between internal and external states ( i.e. , a larger effective ldp @xmath266 [ eq . [ etaeff ] ] ) .",
    "the considerations in the previous paragraph regarding the time scale of change of the field gradient apply here , too .    for the cooling scheme introduced here to work",

    "@xmath269 this condition can be written as @xmath270 considering the region where the second derivative of the magentic field is maximal ( @xmath271 ) and inserting numbers into relation [ db2 ] gives for ten ions @xmath272 .",
    "the right - hand side of this inequality is dimensionless if @xmath1 is inserted in a.m.u . , and yields @xmath273 for @xmath78yb@xmath79ions and @xmath274mhz .",
    "hence , relation [ db2 ] is fulfilled .",
    "this can be understood by considering that the typical distance , @xmath275 over which the gradient has to vary is much larger than the range of motion , @xmath276 of an individual ion , and the approximation of a linear field gradient is a good one .",
    "we have proposed a scheme for cooling the vibrational motion of ions in a linear trap configuration .",
    "axial vibrational modes are simultaneously cooled close to their ground state by superimposing the red motional sidebands in the absorption spectrum of different ions such that the red sideband of each mode is excited when driving an internal transition of the ions with monochromatic radiation .",
    "this spectral property is achieved by applying a magnetic field gradient along the trap axis shifting individually the internal ionic resonances by a desired amount .",
    "exemplary results of numerical simulations for the case of an ion chain consisting of @xmath99 ions are presented and extensively discussed .",
    "detailed simulations have also been carried out with @xmath277 and for some values @xmath98 .",
    "they lead to the same qualitative conclusion as presented for the case of @xmath99 .",
    "numerical studies show that simultaneously raman cooling all axial modes is effective for realistic sets of parameters .",
    "these studies also reveal that using microwave radiation to drive the sideband transition is not as efficient , due to the relatively small mechanical effect associated with the excitation of this transition .",
    "the mechanical effect could be enhanced by applying a larger magnetic field gradients . for simultaneous sideband cooling of all vibrational modes , however , the gradient is fixed by the requirement of superimposing the sidebands .",
    "usual sideband cooling on a hyperfine or zeeman transition using microwave radiation becomes possible , if a larger field gradient is used .",
    "this may be particularly useful , if a single ion ( or an atom in an optical dipole trap ) is to be sideband cooled using a microwave transition , or , if the vibrational modes of an ion chain are to be cooled sequentially using microwave radiation . moreover ,",
    "these techniques could also be implemented for sympathetic cooling of an ion chain , whereby some modes are simultaneously cooled by addressing ions of other species embedded in the chain  @xcite .    in conclusion",
