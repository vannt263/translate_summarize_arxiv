    "r0.5        in the ild collaboration the particle flow calorimetry is the mandatory technique which requires at least 10 mm @xmath010 mm lateral segmentation in the electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) @xcite .",
    "the scintillator - strip electromagnetic calorimeter ( scecal ) is one of the proposed concepts for such ecal . in the concept strip - shape scintillators in odd layers",
    "are put orthogonally with respect to those even layers and forms about 30 layers of sampling calorimeter .",
    "the tungsten layers are put between such sensitive layers as the absorber layers .",
    "for example , a typical size of the scintillator strip in lateral dimension is 10 mm @xmath0 45 mm in order to achieve the effective 10 mm @xmath010 mm segmentation , which has been implemented in the prototype module and tested at fermi national accelerator laboratory ( fnal ) in 2008 and 2009 @xcite . to extract the best performance of such the strip segmentation detector",
    ", reconstruction algorithm is being developed . including the development of such algorithm , status of the simulation tools for the study of the scecal performance",
    "is reported in this manuscript .",
    "resent studies suggest that 5 mm @xmath0  5 mm segmentation is better for ecal @xcite .",
    "therefore , 5 mm width scintillator strips are also discussed in this study .",
    "figure [ fig : geometry ] shows the geometry of the ecal in mokka @xcite which is the detector simulator for the ild . the scecal has the same global structure as the silicon tungsten ecal ( siecal ) @xcite which is another concept of ecal .",
    "ecal barrel part is made from eight staves in azimuthal angle direction and a stave is made of five modules as shown in figure  [ fig : module ] .",
    "hr0.5            in the current plan",
    "the scecal is designed having 27 common thick layers , while siecal has two different absorber thickness layers in 20 layers and 10 layers .",
    "a pair of layers where the scintillator strips in each layer are mutually orthogonal to the ones in the other layer , constructs a detector unit called slab .",
    "figure  [ fig : slab ] shows a structure of slab .",
    "these two scintillator layers are mounted on the both above and below sides of a `` h '' shape tungsten absorber , and they are sealed between the printed circuit boards ( pcbs ) .",
    "besides , the copper plates cover them as the thermal radiators . with most outside shielding films ,",
    "a salb is inserted into a column of shelf structure made of the tungsten plates which also form absorber layers as shown in figure  [ fig : module ] .",
    "the default thickness of the scintillator is 2.0 mm and tungsten absorber layers has 3.0 mm thickness .",
    "the hits in ecal are generated as the hits on 5 mm @xmath0  5 mm square cells in mokka , and hits on the square cells then are merged into strip shapes in the digitizer of the marlin @xcite .      to achieve the effective 5 mm @xmath0 5 mm segmentation with scintillator strips which have 5 mm width and some longer longitudinal length ,",
    "the triplet method was developed by daniel jeans @xcite .",
    "in the first step of the triplet method , the mip tracks are searched considering only cells with a hit consistent with the passage of a simple mip through the cell , and which have a limited number of nearest neighbors in the same layer .",
    "the tpc tracks associated with these calorimeter tracks are considered as the tracks break into the calorimeter . using the remaining unassociated hits the two dimensional calorimeter clustering ( 2-d clustering )",
    "is carried out .",
    "the 2-d clustering is to make the clusters of neighbor strip in each layer .",
    "when multiple energy peaks exist in a 2-d cluster , it is split into the clusters for the respective peaks .",
    "figure  [ fig:2dclustering ] shows a schematic diagram of the 2-d clustering .",
    "these 2-d clusters are combined into `` triplets '' in the next step .",
    "hr0.65            a triplet is made from the three clusters in successive three layers , which overlap .",
    "figure  [ fig : triplet ] left shows a schematic diagram to make a triplet , where the scintillator strips have longitudinal direction along the @xmath1 axis in @xmath2 layer and they are finely segmented along to the @xmath1 axis in @xmath3 layers .",
    "the hit position in the longitudinal direction of scintillator strip in @xmath2 layer is calculated from the average of the energy weighted cluster position of above and below clusters . after making triplets for every successive three layers , triplets which have two clusters in common",
    "are combined to make a `` calorimeter track '' explained in figure  [ fig : triplet ] right .",
    "this procedure is done from the inner surface of ecal .",
    "when a combination of calorimeter tracks reduces a discrepancy between the tpc track momentum and calorimeter track energy , such calorimeter tracks are combined together .    the position and deposited energy of the hits included in those calorimeter tracks are turned over to the pandorapfaprocessor which makes the particle flow approach .",
    "figure  [ fig : resolution ] shows the jet energy resolution as a function of the length of the scintillator strips performed before the triplet method is implemented .",
    "the energy resolution gradually degrades as the length increases.the triplet method is expected to reduce those degradation .",
    "one of the possible reason of the degradation of jet energy resolution is the two - fold ambiguity by the multi hits in a square which has four edges shaped with the longitudinal size of the scintillator strips shown in figure[fig : twofoldambiguity ] . when the tpc track - information works correctly , the fake calorimeter tracks are merged into the correct calorimeter tracks optimizing the matching between tpc track momentum and the energy of the calorimeter track .",
    "one of the way to resolve this problem is to replace some layers with some fine segmented square cell layers .",
    "figure  [ fig : hybrid ] shows an example of such structure of ecal layers .",
    "we will study these type of detectors in future .",
    "the smallest unit of sensitive scintillator detector is made of a plastic scintillator strip , a pixelated photon detector ( ppd ) sit in the housing made on the one side of the scintillator strip , wave length shift ( wls ) fiber to collect the scintillation photons and a film reflector envelopes the scintillator .",
    "an example of the structure of the detector unit was used in the tested prototype module at fnal @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:10x45strip ] shows the detector unit used in the prototype module . some of these materials make dead volume of detector .",
    "these dead volume potentially degrade the performance of the detector . according to our simulation study for the prototype module tested in fnal , the effect from reflector film thickness",
    "is small enough on both the constant term and the stochastic term of quadratic parameterization of the energy resolution .",
    "although the effect from the thickness of ppd is also small enough , the stochastic term of the energy resolution increase if the ppd thickness increases more than current size . additionally , we have a plan to change the width of the scintillator strip to 5 mm for effective segmentation of 5 mm @xmath0 5 mm . in this case the dead volume increases .",
    "therefore the realistic simulation including the dead volume mentioned above is required .",
    "the scintillator size is shown in figure  [ fig : newdetail ] . in order to decrease the dead volume , the smallest size of mppc produced by hamamatsu k.k .",
    "will be used ; the size of its package is 2.0 mm @xmath0  2.5 mm @xmath0  0.9 mm . according to the study of position dependence of the sensitivity of 5 mm @xmath0  45 mm @xmath0  3 mm scintillator",
    ", we do not need wls fiber to improve the uniformity of sensitivity for the 5 mm width scintillator strip .",
    "although more detail study of the position dependence of sensitivity without wls fiber is ongoing , our plan is not to use the wls fiber in the next step .",
    "ild software group has plan to implement these realistic simulation in mokka near future .",
    "the goal of scecal group of ild is to achieve precise jet energy resolution using strip shape scintillators with the same performance as the one done with 5 mm @xmath0  5 mm square cell .",
    "if it is achieved , the amount of photon sensors can be reduced . to achieve this",
    ", we are developing the algorithm to extract the best performance from the scecal . to avoid the two - fold ambiguity , hybrid calorimeter of the square cell layers and the strip cell layers",
    "are suggested .",
    "the improvement of the geometry model in mokka is in progress to include those new configurations .",
