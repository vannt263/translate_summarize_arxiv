    "since the late 70s , study of libration point orbits has been of great interest . indeed , several missions such as isee-3 ( nasa ) in 1978 , soho ( esa - nasa ) in 1996 , genesis ( nasa ) in 2001 , plank ( esa ) in 2007 etc . have put this design knowledge into practice .",
    "a more profound understanding of the available mission options has also emerged due to the theoretical , analytical , and numerical advances in many aspects of libration point mission design .",
    "there exist a huge number of references on the problem of determining low - cost trajectories by using the properties of lagrange equilibrium points .",
    "for instance , the authors in @xcite have developed very efficient methods to find `` zero cost '' trajectories between libration point orbits .",
    "dynamical system methods are used to construct heteroclinic orbits from invariant manifolds between libration point orbits and it allows to get infinite time uncontrolled transfers .",
    "these orbits have been used with impulse engines of spacecrafts to construct finite time transfers . in this work ,",
    "we want to perform the transfer with a low - thrust propulsion , so impulses to reach heteroclinic orbits ( or trajectories on invariant manifolds ) are prohibited .",
    "invariant manifolds have been used in a low - thrust mission in  @xcite .",
    "the low - thrust propulsion is introduced by means of special attainable sets that are used in conjunction with invariant manifolds to define a first - guess solution .",
    "then , the solution is optimized using an optimal control formalism .",
    "one can note that  @xcite is the first work that combines invariant manifolds and low - thrust in the earth - moon system .",
    "much efforts have been dedicated to the design of efficient methods to reach periodic orbits , halo orbits , around equilibrium points in the three body problem .",
    "for example , in  @xcite , authors use indirect methods and direct multiple shooting methods to reach an insertion point on a manifold to reach asymptotically a halo orbit in the earth - moon system .",
    "moreover , using transversality conditions , the position of the insertion point on the manifold is optimized on the manifold .",
    "low - thrust , stable - manifold transfers to halo orbits are also shown in  @xcite .",
    "on the same topic , in  @xcite , authors use direct methods to reach a point on a stable manifold of a halo orbit from a gto orbit . a transfer from the halo orbit to a lunar - orbit",
    "is established as well .",
    "the @xmath1-norm of the control is minimized by a direct transcription and non linear programming . in @xcite ,",
    "the position of insertion point on the manifold is optimized .",
    "we can notice that in the interesting work  @xcite , indirect method combined with continuation methods have been used to design missions from an earth geostationary orbit to a lunar orbit .",
    "indeed , continuations are used from the two body problem to the three body problem , the minimum time problem is studied and solved , and continuations between energy minimization and fuel consumption minimization are computed .    moreover , in  @xcite , the developed methods involve the minimum - time problem , the minimum energy problem and the minimum fuel problem to reach a fixed point on a halo orbit starting from a periodic orbit around earth .",
    "continuations on the thrust are used as well as newton and bisection methods ( indirect methods ) . in these last two contributions ,",
    "manifolds are not used to help solve the formulated problem .    in @xcite ,",
    "the author recently developed an efficient method to compute an optimal low - thrust transfer trajectory in _ finite _ time without using invariant manifolds of the three body problem .",
    "it is based on a three - step solution method using indirect methods and continuations methods and it gives good results .",
    "the philosophy of the method developed in this work is to use the natural dynamics as invariant manifolds , providing free parts for transfer , and to initialize a global multiple shooting method freeing the constraints to stay on the manifold .",
    "the invariant manifolds are just there to help obtain convergence for a shooting method . for references on techniques used in our work such as continuation on cost , smoothing techniques , optimization techniques one may read  @xcite .",
    "to compute the required transfer with a low thrust and minimizing the energy ( @xmath0-minimization ) , we will use indirect methods coming from the pontryagin maximum principle  @xcite .",
    "initialization of indirect methods with dynamics properties is a real challenge in order to improve the efficiency of indirect methods ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , the main difficulty of such methods is to initialize the newton - like algorithm , and the understanding of the dynamics can be very useful to construct an admissible trajectory for the initialization . moreover ,",
    "continuation methods as used in  @xcite or  @xcite , are crucial to give robustness to these indirect methods .",
    "the aim of this paper is to combine all these mathematical aspects of dynamics , optimal control and continuation methods to design low - thrust transfers between libration point orbits .",
    "principle , we only get necessary conditions of optimality .",
    "it would be interesting to check the second order sufficient conditions , with focal point tests for example .",
    "the outline for the article is as follows .",
    "first , in section  [ sec : mission ] , we introduce the mission we want to perform and compute , introduce the paradigm of the circular restricted three body problem and state our optimal control problem .    then , in section  [ sec : dynamics ] , we recall dynamical properties of the circular restricted three body problem , such as equilibrium points , lyapunov periodic orbits , and invariant manifolds .",
    "we present the mathematical tools used to numerically compute the periodic orbits and the manifolds .",
    "in particular , we introduce in this part the continuation method that we will use throughout this article",
    ".    then , in section  [ sec : method ] , we develop our method with an example mission . we first compute a heteroclinic orbit between the two lyapunov periodic orbits .",
    "then , fixing the departure point near @xmath2 and the arrival point near @xmath1 and with a not to small thrust ( ) , we perform two small transfers from the lyapunov orbit around @xmath2 to the heteroclinic one , and from the heteroclinic orbit to the lyapunov orbit around @xmath1",
    ". then , thanks to a multiple shooting method we release the constraint on the position of the matching points on the heteroclinic orbit and decrease the thrust to the targeted one ( ) .",
    "finally , we optimize the departure and arrival points on the periodic orbits to satisfy the necessary transversality conditions given by the pontryagin maximum principle . in section  [ sec : mission2 ] , we present another mission with a heteroclinic orbit with two revolutions around the moon .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : halohalo ] , we apply the method to a more general mission : a halo to halo mission for two periodic orbits with different energies . in this case",
    ", there is no heteroclinic orbit , so we construct an admissible trajectory with 5 parts .",
    "two of them are trajectories on invariant manifolds , and the three others are local transfers : 1/ from one of the halo orbits to a free trajectory , 2/ between both free trajectories and 3/ from the second free trajectory to the second halo orbit .",
    "thanks to this five part admissible trajectory , we are able to initialize a multiple shooting method that computes an optimal trajectory ( which is not constrained to reach any invariant manifolds ) . as previously ,",
    "we optimize the terminal points on halo orbits .",
    "we use the paradigm of the circular restricted three body problem . in this section",
    "we will follow the description by @xcite .",
    "let us consider a spacecraft in the field of attraction of earth and moon .",
    "we consider an inertial frame @xmath3 in which the vector differential equation for the spacecraft s motion is written as : @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the masses respectively of earth , the moon and the spacecraft , @xmath8 is the spacecraft vector position , @xmath9 is the vector earth - spacecraft and @xmath10 is the vector moon - spacecraft . @xmath11 is the gravitational constant .",
    "let us describe the simplified general framework we will use .    * problem description . *     to simplify the problem , and use a general framework , we consider the motion of the spacecraft @xmath12 of negligible mass moving under the gravitational influence of the two masses @xmath13 and @xmath14 , referred to as the primary masses , or simply the _ primaries _",
    "( here earth and moon ) .",
    "we denote these primaries by @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that the primaries have circular orbits around their common center of mass .",
    "the particle @xmath12 is free to move all around the primaries but can not affect their motion .",
    "the system is made adimensional by the following choice of units : the unit of mass is taken to be @xmath17 ; the unit of length is chosen to be the constant distance between @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; the unit of time is chosen such that the orbital period of @xmath15 and @xmath16 about their center of mass is @xmath18 .",
    "the universal constant of gravitation then becomes @xmath19 .",
    "conversions from units of distance , velocity and time in the unprimed , normalized system to the primed , dimensionalized system are @xmath20 where we denote by @xmath21 the distance between @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath22 the orbital velocity of @xmath15 and @xmath23 the orbital period of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we define the only parameter of this system as @xmath24 and call it the _ mass parameter _ , assuming that @xmath25 .    in table",
    "[ tab : parameters ] , we summarize the values of all the constants for the earth - moon cr3pb for numerical computations .",
    ".table of the parameter values for the earth - moon system . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     -plane .",
    "the control is represented by arrows.,title=\"fig : \" ] -plane .",
    "the control is represented by arrows.,title=\"fig : \" ]     in newton . ]",
    "to design different spacecraft missions between periodic orbits around lagrange points , we have used natural ( uncontrolled ) trajectories computed thanks to the invariant manifolds of the periodic orbits .",
    "we have connected resulting arcs with short transfers using the pmp and indirect methods .",
    "doing that , we have designed admissible trajectories performing the mission with controlled and uncontrolled parts .",
    "the resulting admissible trajectories have been used to initialize an indirect multiple shooting method in which we released the constraints to join uncontrolled parts , _",
    "i.e. _ , to force the spacecraft to follow the natural drift .",
    "we have finally obtained a trajectory satisfying the first order necessary conditions for optimality given by the pmp .    in order to improve the robustness of our indirect approach , we have designed and implemented appropriate continuations on the final state and on the thrust .",
    "thanks to this , the execution of the overall computation is run within short time ( of order of a few minutes ) , and results have the excellent accuracy of the underlying newton method .    one can note that , when there is an heteroclinic orbit between the two terminal periodic orbits , the optimal enjoys a turnpike property .",
    "proving the turnpike feature for such control - affine systems with drift is an open issue , which may deserve consideration because it gives an approach to successfully initialize a variant of the shooting method in a simple and efficient way ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , as already mentioned , we have considered the @xmath0-minimization of the cost , leaving the computation of the @xmath26-minimization solution with a _ bang - bang _ control as an open issue for farther studies ."
