    "in this note we give a brief review of some combinatorial graphs associated with the normal ordering of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the process of normally ordering a string of creation and annihilation operators simply means reordering the elements of the string so that all the annihilation operators appear on the right , taking into account the commutation ( or anti - commutation ) relations .",
    "the value of such a procedure is that , for example , the expectation value in a coherent state of such a normally ordered string may be immediately seen . performing this operation on strings of bosons or fermions leads to classical combinatorial numbers and , in the analogous _ quon _ case , to @xmath0-variants of these numbers . in a `` supersymmetric '' context",
    "one may well have to consider a general string of bosons and fermions ; but as the bosons and fermions are assumed to commute , the ordering reduces trivially to ordering the two species separately .",
    "we thus assume the basic commutation relations    * bosons @xmath1={\\delta}_{ij}$ ] * fermions @xmath2 * mixed @xmath3=0 $ ]    we note that the boson ordering problem is equivalent to ordering a string of operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    for both bosons and fermions , the ordering process of a general string results in combinatorial numbers called _",

    "the conventional and picturesque description of the classical bell and stirling numbers of the second kind is in terms of the distribution of differently coloured balls among identical containers or , equivalently , the number of partitions of an @xmath44-element set @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the relation of this classical definition to the normal order expansion of @xmath45 is via the contractions induced by the application of wick s theorem . in general",

    "we shall elaborate on this graphical approach elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in general , for combinatorial numbers @xmath55 we may define an _ exponential generating function _ @xmath56 through @xcite @xmath57 for the bell numbers , this generating function takes the particularly nice form @xcite @xmath58 we shall derive this exponential generating function by the use of a simple graph theory technique .",
    "some initial terms of the sequence @xmath59 are @xmath60 .",
    "another convenient way of representing combinatorial numbers is by means of _ graphs_. to illustrate this , we now consider a graphical method for describing the combinatorial numbers @xmath61 associated with the normal order expansion of @xmath45 .",
    "for concreteness , take the cases @xmath62 ( figure 1 ) . in this diagram",
    "the filled dots on the left represent the differently coloured balls , while the empty dots represent the identical containers .",
    "this pictorial approach gives the values for @xmath46 . by convention , @xmath63 .",
    "one reason the graphical representation is useful is that there exist some rather powerful results which apply to graphs and their associated generating functions .",
    "we list and apply two such results , labelled a and b , in what follows .",
    "+   + * a. connected graph theorem * +   + this states that if @xmath64 is the exponential generating function of _ labelled connected _ graphs , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath65 counts the number of connected graphs of order @xmath44 , then @xmath66 is the exponential generating function for _ all _ graphs",
    ".    we may apply this very simply to the case of the @xmath61 graphs in figure 1 . for each order @xmath44 ,",
    "the _ connected _ graphs clearly consist of a single graph .",
    "therefore for each @xmath44 we have @xmath67 ; whence , @xmath68 it follows that the generating function for _ all _ the graphs @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 which is the generating function for the bell numbers .    such graphs may be generalised to give graphical representations for the extensions @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "we illustrate this by using the following powerful result on certain classes of graphs : +   + * b. generating function for a class of graphs * +   + we generalize the graphical representation for the bell numbers given in figure 1 . as before , we shall be counting labelled lines .",
    "a line starts from a black dot , the _ origin _ , and ends at a white dot , the _",
    "vertex_. what we refer to as _ origin _ and _ vertex _ is , of course , arbitrary . at this point",
    "there are no other rules , although we are at liberty to impose further restrictions ; a black dot may be the origin of 1,2,3 , ... lines , and a white dot the vertex for 1,2,3 , ... lines .",
    "we may further associate _ strengths _ @xmath71 with each vertex receiving @xmath72 lines , and multipliers @xmath73 with a black dot which is the origin of @xmath74 lines .",
    "again @xmath75 and @xmath76 play symmetric roles ; in this note we shall only consider cases where the @xmath73 are either @xmath77 or @xmath78 .    in figure [ figc ]",
    "we illustrate these rules for four different graphs corresponding to @xmath79 .",
    "there is an exponential generating function @xmath80 which counts the number @xmath55 of graphs with @xmath44 lines arising from the above rules @xcite , @xcite : @xmath81 _ example 1 : _ the exponential generating function corresponding to figure 1 is obtained by putting @xmath82 for @xmath83 and @xmath84 for all @xmath72 .",
    "this immediately gives the exponential generating function for the bell numbers @xmath85 as @xmath86 , a result we have already obtained through use of the connected graph theorem above .",
    "+ _ example 2 : _ the diagrams of figure 1 , that is corresponding to @xmath82 for @xmath83 , are in a sense generic for the wick contractions occurring in expressions such as @xmath87 @xcite . however , the coefficients @xmath71 depend on the exponent @xmath88 .",
    "we obtain the exponential generating function for @xmath42 , corresponding to the normal ordering of @xmath89 , by putting @xmath90 .",
    "this immediately leads to the formal expression @xmath91 which is the exponential generating function for @xmath42 @xcite , @xcite .",
