    "advances in nanotechnology have made it possible to fabricate quantum dots ( qds ) and to study their transport properties .",
    "single quantum dots can be considered as artificial atoms if the energy levels can be resolved .",
    "two or more qds can be coupled to form an artificial molecule , in which the electrons are shared by different sites .",
    "recently , much interest is devoted to the study of the properties of these coupled qds or artificial molecules @xcite .",
    "one of the most important challenges is to understand the basic properties of coupled qds since they display the simplest structures of quantum - computing devices that can be controlled by means of external parameters .",
    "an example is the interdot coupling that can be tuned by external parameters far out of the regimes known for natural molecules .",
    "the ground - state interatomic distance is dictated , in natural molecules , by the nature of bonding @xcite while such a restriction does not exist in artificial molecules .",
    "most of the work has focused on the situation where the coupled qds are in the tunneling regime so that the physics is dominated by coulomb blockade effects @xcite .",
    "it was observed a pronounced anticrossing resonance scenario ( called also avoided level crossing scenario ) instead of a simple crossing one .",
    "recently rushforth _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the movement of electrons between the dots .",
    "application of a voltage onto the gate between the dots allows to vary the length as well as the width of the wire connecting the dots .",
    "the study revealed evidence that electrons move between the dots via excited states of either the single dots or the double dot molecule .    in the present paper , we consider the ballistic transport through a double qd in the regime where coulomb blockade effects can be neglected and where the transmission is resonant .",
    "the two single qds are connected by a wire of finite length .",
    "this gives the possibility to vary the length or the width of the wire and to study the transmission through the double qd as a function of the wire s size and energy .",
    "when the length @xmath0 of the wire is much larger than its width then the wire has at least one eigenmode with the energy @xmath3 .",
    "this mode appears additionally to the eigenstates @xmath4 of the two single qds ( where @xmath5 is the radius of the dot ) which may be equal to one another or different from one another .",
    "such a double qd system allows therefore to investigate , among others , the quantum mechanical problem of the coupling of two identical quantum systems that is provided by a third quantum mechanical subsystem with an own energy spectrum .",
    "this system is the analogue of a molecule with hydrogen bonds .",
    "some years ago , the phase of the transmission amplitude has been measured in a double - slit interference experiment @xcite .",
    "the results showed phase jumps by @xmath2 between resonances which raised intensive theoretical work for an explanation @xcite .",
    "most of these calculations associate the sharp phase drops with the occurrence of transmission zeros and relate them to the interference zeros of fano resonances . in @xcite , it was shown however that the existence of a transmission zero is , indeed , a necessary condition for the phase jump but not a sufficient one .",
    "the sharp phase change bases , according to @xcite , on the destructive interference between neighboring resonance states and thus differs from the mechanism based on the fano interference picture .",
    "destructive interferences between neighbored resonances are considered also in @xcite .",
    "the fano resonance phenomenon characterizes the interference between a single resonance with a relatively smooth background @xcite .",
    "the interference processes in the regime of overlapping resonances are , however , much more complicated than those in the regime of isolated resonances .",
    "this has been demonstrated , e.g. , in an experimental study of the conductance through a quantum dot in an aharonov - bohm interferometer @xcite and in a theoretical study @xcite .",
    "these results are another hint to the conclusion , drawn in @xcite , that the sharp phase changes observed in @xcite are the result of processes being different from the simple fano interference picture .    here , we study the transmission properties of the double qd system when one lead is attached to the first single qd , another one to the second single qd , and both single qds are connected by a wire of finite length @xmath0 . also in this system , transmission zeros appear .",
    "the special situation of a double qd is such that the transmission zeros of the whole system are determined by the zeros in the transmission through the single qds .",
    "since phase jumps in the transmission amplitudes are related to the transmission zeros , the mechanism of their appearance in a double qd system is expected to be different from that based on the simple picture of fano resonances",
    ".    we will show in the present paper that transmission zeros of first order of a single 2d qd cause phase jumps by @xmath2 in the amplitude of the transmission through this single qd .",
    "it depends on the spectral properties of both single qds and on the manner they are connected to the wire and to the leads , whether or not the transmission zeros of the single qds cause phase jumps of the transmission amplitudes of the double qd system . when the single qds remain true 2d - systems in the double qd ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) and have different energy spectra , each transmission zero of each single qd causes a transmission zero of the same type in the double qd system .",
    "when the spectra of both single qds are however equal ( and their connection to the wire and the leads is the same as above ) , the corresponding transmission zeros of the double qd system are of second order .",
    "they give rise to two phase jumps , each by @xmath2 , that compensate each other .",
    "when a resonance state crosses this transmission zero at a certain length of the wire , its decay width vanishes and a phase jump appears now due to the extremely narrow resonance .",
    "the transmission zeros do not depend on the length of the wire when there is only one channel for the propagation of the mode in the wire and in the leads .    in sect .",
    "ii , we present some numerical results for the transmission through a double qd that consists of two single qds connected by a wire",
    ". the main features of the transmission are represented as a function of the length @xmath0 of the wire inside the double qd : the transmission zeros are independent of @xmath0 while many transmission peaks show some periodicity as a function of @xmath0 . in the following sections",
    ", we study the transmission through a double qd in detail by using a simple model with only a few levels in both single qds and one level in the wire .",
    "the description is based on the @xmath1 matrix theory for the transmission through quantum dots @xcite . in sect .",
    "iii , the formalism is derived and some typical numerical results are given and discussed .",
    "the spectral properties of the double qd are characterized by the ( complex ) eigenvalues of the effective hamiltonian that describes the double qd when opened by attaching the two leads to it .",
    "this effective hamiltonian is non - hermitian , and its eigenvalues provide both the positions in energy and the decay widths of the states .",
    "the appearance of transmission zeros is determined by the spectral properties of the two single qds .",
    "the relation between transmission zeros and phase jumps is discussed in section iv .",
    "most results are obtained for the case that the two single qds keep their 2d structure when connected to the leads and to the wire .",
    "the results show very clearly that the mechanism differs from that based on the simple fano interference picture : the spectral properties of the states of the double qd system depend strongly on the length of the wire , while the transmission zeros do not depend at all on the length .",
    "the transmission zeros are of first order when the energy spectra of the two single qds are different from one another , and of second order when the spectra of the two single qds are identical . with the last section ,",
    "we conclude the present study by mentioning some results for more complicated double qd systems .",
    "in particular we consider the case that the widths of the leads and of the wire are different from one another .",
    "when the wire s width exceeds the lead s one , a few channels can propagate through the wire and the transmission zeros depend on the wire s length .",
    "let us consider first a double qd consisting of two identical single qds , for example , two circular dots , that are connected by a wire of the length @xmath0 . for simplicity",
    "we choose the width of the wire @xmath6 equal to the width of the leads , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "the theory of transmission through such a system is given by klimenko and onipko @xcite . if the dots are identical , the probability of the transmission for the single - channel case is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the complex amplitude of the transmission through the single qd , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the wave number related to the energy of the single - channel transmission as @xmath11 all values are dimensionless via the characteristic energy @xmath12 and the width @xmath6 of the wire and the leads . in the expression ( [ t2 ] ) , evanescent modes are ignored whose wave vectors are imaginary .",

    "the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are obtained from numerical calculations with @xmath14 . here , formula ( [ t2 ] ) is applicable already for @xmath15 .",

    "the transmission probability demonstrates a few interesting features that are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) - ( d ) .",
    "the first is some periodical dependence of the transmission peaks on the wire length and on the energy .",
    "this dependence can be seen immediately in formula ( [ t2 ] ) , and we will not discuss it further .",
    "the second feature are the transmission zeros .",
    "they do not at all depend on the wire length , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( d ) where the transmission probability @xmath20 is shown in logarithmic scale . also this feature follows directly from ( [ t2 ] ) : the zeros of the transmission probability @xmath21 through the single qd lead directly to zeros of the total transmission probability @xmath20 .",
    "the third feature concerns the peaks of the transmission probability . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] demonstrates crossings and anticrossings of resonant peaks as observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "some of them are independent of the length @xmath0 , as the transmission zeros , while other ones are dependent on @xmath0 .",
    "the latter ones cross the @xmath0 independent peaks as well as the zeros , but the behaviour in the vicinity of the crossing with a zero is different from that in the vicinity of the crossing with a maximum .    in the following",
    ", we will consider these features in detail .",
    "for this purpose , we use the periodicity ( first feature ) of the transmission picture that allows us to restrict the investigation to the transmission properties of a simple model with only a few states .",
    "the study is based on the s - matrix theory .",
    "the hamiltonian of the double qd shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) consists of three parts : two parts describe the two single qds and a third one is related to the wire .",

    ". then the total hamiltonian has the following matrix form @xmath30 the hamiltonian ( [ hb ] ) differs from those used in the literature @xcite for the description of a double qd of similar shape by taking explicitly into account the third part ( [ hwire ] ) for the wire .    for the simplest case @xmath31 and equal single qds",
    ", the total hamiltonian takes the following form @xmath32 the eigenvalues of this hamiltonian are @xmath33 and the eigenstates read @xmath34 it is remarkable that one of the eigenenergies of the total system coincides with the energy @xmath35 of the single qd .",

    "then it follows @xmath37 , if the wire is a straight one .",
    "the determinant which defines the eigenvalues of the total hamiltonian is of rank @xmath38 , @xmath39 when @xmath40 two lines in ( [ det ] ) coincide .",

    "when the coupling of the double qd system to the reservoir is relatively weak [ meaning that the ratio @xmath101 is small as in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( a , b , d ) ] , the transmission probability follows the eigenenergies of the closed double qd , and we have resonant transmission",

    "[ fig3 ] ( b ) with fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and we see that the simple model , basic of fig . [ fig3 ] ( a ) , is able to explain the peaks of the transmission probability .",
    "that means , the main features of the transmission picture in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , are related to the crossing of the levels of the single qd with the energy level of the wire . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) different scenarios of the resonant transmission peaks can be realized from the crossing to the anticrossing behavior in dependence on the parameters , basically on the coupling strength between the system and the attached leads and on the coupling strength between the dots and the wire .",
    "we can further learn from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that the transmission through a system consisting of two dots that are connected by a wire , is characterized by the ratio @xmath101 . here",

    "correspondingly , the transmission zero becomes of first order at @xmath134 , see fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) .",
    "that means the resonance state whose decay width vanishes when crossing the energy of the transmission zero , restores the first order of the transmission zero as well as the phase jump by @xmath2 .",
    "the connection of the two single qds to the leads and to the wire may differ from that shown in fig .",
    "when one of the single qds loses its 2d - character by the manner it is integrated in the double qd system , only transmission zeros of first order appear in the double qd .",
    "when both single qds are included as 1d dots , the double qd system has no transmission zero at all . in this case",
    ", the whole system behaves as a 1d chain of sites without any transmission zeros .",
    "from the present study , we conclude that the simple model used by us for the description of a double qd system consisting of two single qds coupled by a wire , is efficient and describes qualitatively the features of the resonant transmission through a realistic double qd of the same structure .",
    "the difference between the transmission through the realistic double qd shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and the model cases shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] , [ fig5 ] , [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] consists , above all , in the fact that all features of the simple model are multiply repeating in the realistic case .",
    "these multiple effects in realistic cases are related , obviously , to the large dimension of the single qds and to the higher number of eigenmodes of the wire inside the double qd system .",
    "the advantage of the simple model described by @xmath1 matrix theory is that it allows a clear discussion of the main features of the transmission , especially of the transmission zeros and of the phase jumps related to them . of course",
    ", the model can give only qualitative results that do not agree quantitatively with the numerical results ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) obtained for the realistic double qd system .",
    "however there is a large room to further develop the model .",
    "first , we can take the eigenenergies of the wire for the single channel propagation as @xmath177 where @xmath6 is the width of the wire .",
    "the first term in ( [ epsl ] ) is related to the first - channel propagation in the wire .",
    "moreover we can take into account that the eigenstates of the wire have the form @xmath178 then @xmath102 can be calculated in the same way as @xmath43 @xcite @xmath179 and the hamiltonian ( [ hwire ] ) reads @xmath180    in our calculations we have chosen the widths of the wire inside the double qd and the widths of leads attached to the qd to be the same .",
    "thereby , the leads and the wire both support only single channel transmission through the double qd .",
    "experimentally , however , the width of the wire varies , usually , by applying gate voltages @xcite while the length of the leads remains fixed . in order to model this case ,",
    "we can consider two energy levels of the wire one of which is related to the first channel propagation ( [ epsl ] ) and the other one to the second channel propagation @xmath181 when the wire s",
    "width @xmath6 exceeds the lead s width , we can take one energy level ( [ epsl ] ) ( say , @xmath182 ) together with another one from ( [ epsl2 ] ) ( say , @xmath183 ) in such a manner that they cross at a certain length @xmath184 ,  @xmath185 .",
    "the numerical results obtained for the transmission probability ( fig . [ fig10 ] ) for such a case are the following . for single channel propagation in the wire ,",
    "the transmission features including the transmission zeros are similar to those discussed above .",
    "the number of transmission zeros remains unchanged , but the number of transmission peaks is doubled corresponding to the two modes in the wire .",
    "these results correspond to those obtained for the single channel transmission through a realistic double dot system ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    .",
    "the coupling strengths @xmath102 between the single qds and the wire are taken according to ( [ ul ] ) , @xmath186 . in ( a ) and",
    "( b ) , the first - channel propagation is shown with the two energies of the wire given by ( [ epsl ] ) , @xmath187 . in ( c ) and ( d ) , the two channel propagation in the wire is shown with the energies @xmath188 and @xmath189 that are crossing .",
    "the dashed lines show the eigenenergies of the isolated wire and the single qds while the solid lines show the eigenenergies of the closed double qd system . ]",
    "the situation is however another one when the wire can support two channel propagation . in this case",
    ", the number of transmission zeros is doubled .",
    "one of the lines of the transmission zeros does not depend on the wire length @xmath0 ( as in the model calculations of sect .",
    "iv ) , but the other one depends on @xmath0 and crosses the first line of the transmission zeros . the multi channel propagation induced by a variable width of the wire can lead , therefore , to an essentially more complicated picture of the transmission zeros .",
    "the picture of transmission zeros as a whole remains however comprehensible on the basis of the results obtained in the framework of the simple model considered above .",
    "it is experimentally easier to vary the wire s width than its length .",
    "it is important therefore to mention that the width @xmath6 and length @xmath0 of the wire are equivalent for the energy levels of the multi - channel wire according to eqs .",
    "( [ epsl ] ) and ( [ epsl2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the transmission probability versus energy and length shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] can be qualitatively considered as the transmission probability versus energy and width of the wire .",
