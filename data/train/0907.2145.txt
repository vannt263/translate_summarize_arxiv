    "the aim of this paper is to obtain the equation of state ( eos ) of a plasma in the low coupling regime with a high precision . in this regime standard monte carlo ( mc ) and molecular dynamics simulations techniques",
    "must be handled with care due to huge finite size effects and , in the other hand , the ideal gas approximation or more elaborated analytical expressions commonly used are valid only but asymptotically , for very small values of the coupling parameters .",
    "such thermodynamic conditions are relevant for many astrophysical or laboratory plasmas hydrodynamics applications .",
    "however we shall restrict ourselves to the well known one - component plasma ( ocp ) model , which consists of identical point ions with number density @xmath8 , charges @xmath9 , moving in a neutralizing background , electrons for instance , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 number of particles , @xmath12 volume of the system@xcite . in the very low coupling regime , the virial expansion supplemented by well documented resummation methods , as the well - known debye - hckel ( dh ) theory @xcite and its extensions ( see e.g. cohen @xcite and , more recently",
    ", ortner @xcite expansions for instance ) give reliable results . in the low to intermediate coupling regimes the hypernetted chain ( hnc ) integral equation @xcite",
    "must be solved numerically . finally , in the strong correlation regime",
    ", the ocp has also been extensively studied by monte carlo and molecular dynamics simulations for three decades , see e.g. @xcite and references cited herein .    in the more recent of these references one of us",
    "has determined the thermodynamic limit of the excess internal energy per particle @xmath13 of the ocp with a high precision by means of mc simulations in the canonical ensemble within hyperspherical boundary conditions @xcite for @xmath14 .",
    "we recall that in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. for an infinite system of particles , the thermodynamics properties of the model depend solely on the coupling parameter @xmath15 ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 boltzmann constant , @xmath18 temperature , and @xmath19 the ionic radius defined by @xmath20 ) , whereas , for a finite sample , an additional dependance on the number of particles @xmath11 remains . in paper  @xcite , henceforth to be referred to as `` i '' , special attention has been brought to describe and take advantage of such finite size effects on the energy @xmath21 to get its thermodynamic limit @xmath13 , using all facilities of work stations available at that time .",
    "recently we have also performed extensive mc simulations of the related yukawa one - component plasma ( yocp ) , i.e. a system made of @xmath11 identical point charges @xmath22 interacting via an effective yukawa pair - potential @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the so - called screening parameter @xcite , not to be discussed however in this work . for the ocp and the yocp as well , in the low @xmath25 regime , the debye length ( i.e. the correlation length associated with charge fluctuations ) becomes of the order or much larger than the size of the simulation box , yielding huge finite size effects on @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , despite these numerous studies and amount of work it appears that hydrocode applications using the combination of data bases and fits coming from various techniques can be affected by numerical instabilities in the transition regime , around @xmath26 . with nowadays computers",
    "it is now possible to explore this range of small @xmath2 values with the help of performant simulation techniques and to obtain such precise results so that they can be considered as the _ reference _ ones to be used in many applications dealing with degenerate astrophysical or laboratory plasmas .",
    "we also examine carefully in this paper the connection between mc and first principle analytical or hnc results for @xmath27 . we have thus explored and precised the domain of validity of each of these methods .",
    "it turns out to be necessary to combine all of these approaches to obtain a continuous representation of @xmath28 in the range @xmath0 .",
    "finally we extract from these combined approaches the best possible analytical representation for @xmath29 .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "next section is devoted to a brief presentation of the main features of low @xmath2 expansions ( section [ ortner ] ) , the hnc integral equation ( section [ hnc ] ) and the rather unusual but efficient mc technique used in this paper ( section [ mc ] ) .",
    "note that we have redone , by passing , extremely accurate hnc calculations and obtained new fits of hnc data , presented in section [ hnc ] . in section [ mcdat ] we present and discuss our mc simulations .",

    "figure  [ fit_g=1 ] illustrates the high quality of the fits obtained in the case @xmath101 .",
    "indeed the extrapolated tl of @xmath85 coincide for both the linear and the quadratic fits ( the latter involving more states with low number of particles and the former only the 3 largest systems ) with a nice overlap of the error bars .",
    "results are similar down to @xmath93 , as illustrated in figure [ fit_g=07 ] for @xmath93 .    in the range @xmath102",
    "the precision of the fits is good but the linear and the quadratic fit extrapolations do not give exactly the same tl values , however the error bars do overlap .",
    "figure  [ fit_g=04 ] , corresponding to the case @xmath92 , illustrates the smallest @xmath2 at which a linear fit is possible with the 3 higher values of @xmath11 .",
    "the linear and the quadratic fit extrapolations giving the tl values would coincide within the error bars if the latter were defined to be _ two standard deviations _ rather than only _",
    "one _ according to our choice .    for @xmath2",
    "smaller or equal to 0.3 it was impossible to reach an asymptotic form of @xmath85 , linear in the variable @xmath103 , and only a quadratic polynomial fit was possible ( cf table  [ lim ] ) .",
    "for that reason it is legitimate to consider the error bars on the extrapolated value @xmath104 as overoptimistic in this range of @xmath2 , see figure  [ fit_g=01 ] for an illustration in the case @xmath86 .",
    "simulations involving larger numbers of particles would be necessary but are out of our reach .",
    "for all the states with a @xmath54 the tl limit @xmath29 can thus be obtained with a high precision @xmath105 , after a careful study of finite size effects on the mc energies @xmath21 . for smaller values of @xmath106 , for instance @xmath107 , samples of more than @xmath108 particles should be used to reach the leading order of the asymptotic regime  [ scaling ] .",
    "however such an effort would be useless since hnc and cohen approximations are then `` exact '' within the wanted precision on @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath29 are perfectly well fitted in the range @xmath82 by the cohen s functional form , given by equation  [ a ] , involving the five parameters @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) given in table  [ coef4 ] .",

    "note however that the scale of the figure is not large enough to discriminate between hnc and mc results , notably because the errors bars on mc results are smaller than the size of the symbols .",

    "the disagreement for @xmath115 results from a bad evaluation of the tl of @xmath116 due to huge finite size effects spoiling the mc data , while the disagreement for @xmath117 simply reflects the failure of the hnc approximation at high @xmath2 . a nearly perfect agreement between mc and hnc results ,",
