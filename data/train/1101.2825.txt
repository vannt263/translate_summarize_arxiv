    "optical vortices arise from phase singularities , typically associated to the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) of light .",
    "the oam of light beams is a classical feature that has only been studied in detail recently @xcite . among other applications @xcite , a key motivation for this study",
    "is related to applications in quantum information@xcite .",
    "these potential applications have motivated the study of the oam in the context of the spatial correlations between photon pairs produced in spontaneous parametric down conversion(spdc ) @xcite .",
    "experimentally , entanglement in the oam of photon pairs has been observed @xcite and quantified in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "these correlations are a consequence of the conservation of the oam in the spdc process , which arises from the transfer of the angular spectrum of the pump beam to the wave function of the down - converted photons @xcite .",
    "investigations of oam correlations between down - converted photons generally rely on one of two types of detection systems . in the first type ,",
    "holographic masks and single mode optical fibers are used to project the down - converted fields onto modes with well - defined oam @xcite , such as the laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) modes . in other experiments ,",
    "point - like detectors are scanned in the transverse detection plane , and the characteristic doughnut modes are observed in the coincidence count distributions @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , one detector was kept fixed while the other was scanned in the two - dimensional detection plane .",
    "the intensity distribution of a doughnut mode does not appear in the single - photon counts but rather only in the joint distribution of coincidence counts .",
    "the correlations observed with these two types of detection systems have been shown to be characteristic of entanglement .",
    "a different kind of non - local optical vortex has been recently observed @xcite . here",
    "the term  non - local \" is related to the two - dimensional space in which the optical vortex appears .",
    "a doughnut - shaped coincidence distribution and phase dislocation was observed , but the pump beam is not prepared in an lg mode and neither of the twin photons are projected onto states with well - defined oam . in all previous experiments , oam correlations were observed only if either the pump , or at least one of the down - converted photons is prepared or projected onto a state with oam different from zero .",
    "this is not the case in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the optical vortex appears in the coordinate plane composed by the position variable of photon 1 and the wave vector variable of photon 2 .    in this paper ,",
    "we generalize the scheme employed in ref .",
    "@xcite and show that the presence of the optical vortex is due to the implementation of a non local mode converter .",
    "we demonstrate that it is possible to create non - local optical vortices of arbitrary order through manipulation of the pump laser beam .",
    "in addition , we show that this can be done separately and simultaneously in two spatial dimensions .",
    "and @xmath0 planes , as well as the double slit interference obtained in coincidence counts .",
    "the blue and red curves correspond to the interference patterns obtained with different positions of detector 2 . in the case of a hg pump beam ,",
    "a shift is observed , while in the case of a gaussian pump beam , no shift is observed ( blue box ) . for comparison ,",
    "the grey box illustrates double slit interference with a a ) gaussian and b ) laguerre - gaussian beam @xmath1.,width=453 ]    fig .",
    "[ setup ] shows a sketch of the experimental set - up used in ref.@xcite to produce a nonlocal optical vortex .",
    "the pump laser is prepared in a first order hermite - gaussian mode ( hg ) @xmath2 , which is achieved by passing half of the gaussian laser beam through a thin glass slide so that a phase difference of @xmath3 is produced between the two halves of the pump beam .",
    "further propagation in free space provides spatial filtering necessary to clean up the beam , producing a good quality @xmath2 mode . this beam",
    "is then focused onto a nonlinear crystal with a cylindrical lens and produces entangled photons through spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) .",
    "twin photons with the same wavelength are collected and detected through narrow band interference filters . for photon 1 ,",
    "an imaging system is used to map the source distribution ( @xmath4 ) onto the detection plane . for photon 2 , a fourier lens maps the wave vector ( @xmath5 ) distribution of the source onto the detection plane .",
    "both detectors are scanned in a line along the vertical ( either @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) detection axis , giving a two - dimensional non - local distribution of coincidence counts .",
    "a typical distribution is sketched in fig .",
    "[ setup ] , showing the doughnut shape that is an indication of the presence of an optical vortex . for comparison ,",
    "[ setup ] also sketches the coincidence distribution when both photons are measured in the position basis @xmath6 .",
    "we see that in this case the coincidence distribution mimics the pump beam inside the crystal @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that the pump beam is not prepared in an lg mode and the down - converted photons are not projected onto lg modes .",
    "the simple observation of a doughnut shape is not enough to prove the existence of the optical vortex .",
    "it is also necessary to obtain information about the azimuthal phase distribution . in ref.@xcite , this was done through a double slit interference experiment . for a classical light beam ,",
    "the phase singularity associated to an lg beam can be evidenced by observing a shift in the interference fringes @xcite , as illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "this method was used to evidence the phase dependence of the nonlocal vortex in ref .",
    "@xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] , a double slit aperture is inserted into the path of photon 1 and the detector is scanned to register the interference fringes in the coincidence distribution for two different positions of detector 2 .",
    "the measurements are performed for two configurations of the pump beam . first pumping with a zero order gaussian beam and second with the @xmath2 mode . in the first case ,",
    "the sets of observed fringes are in phase , while in the second the observed fringes are out of phase ( see figure [ setup ] ) , as in the case of a classical @xmath1 beam .",
    "we will show in section [ sec : nonlocalmodconv ] that this experiment can be viewed as the implementation of mode conversion between a nonlocal hg and lg mode .",
    "to do so , let us briefly review mode conversion of hg and lg beams .",
    "in classical optics , the hermite - gaussian ( hg ) and laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) beams are solutions to the paraxial helmholtz equation @xcite in cartesian and cylindrical coordinates , respectively .",
    "we will write the hg modes as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the number of zeroes of the hermite polynomials @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the order of the hg modes is @xmath13 .",
    "the lg modes can be written as @xmath14 , where the order is @xmath15 .",
    "it is well known that the laguerre - gaussian beams carry orbital angular momentum of @xmath16 per photon @xcite .",
    "beijersbergen _ et al .",
    "_ showed how one can exploit the guoy phase of a paraxial beam to convert hg modes into lg modes or vice - versa @xcite .",
    "the lg modes , for example , can be described as a superposition of hg modes of the same order .",
    "a simple example is the mode @xmath17 , which is given by the superposition of @xmath2 and @xmath18 with a relative phase of @xmath19 : @xmath20 . at the same time , the _ diagonal _ hg mode @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22 and @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 .",
    "one can see that the @xmath23 mode can be converted into the @xmath17 mode by introducing a relative phase between the hg components .",
    "this relative phase can be introduced using a mode converter , which is a set of cylindrical lenses which produces an astigmatic region @xcite , giving rise to the relative phase shift .    in general ,",
    "the dhg modes are given by @xcite @xmath25 while the higher order modes @xmath26 are given by @xmath27 with @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30^{1/2}\\frac{1}{j}\\frac{d^{j}}{dt^{j}}[(1-t)^{n}(1+t)^{m}]|_{t=0}$ ] .",
    "for the higher - order beams , each component @xmath31 in expansion ( [ eq : dhggen ] ) picks up a phase @xmath32 upon propagation through the astigmatic region of the mode converter @xcite . in this way",
    ", one can transform a general @xmath33 mode into an @xmath26 mode of the same order .",
    "in this section , we will show a general method of mode conversion using entangled photons , such as those produced in spdc .",
    "this method is a  non - local \" or distributed mode converter , since the @xmath34 mode is generated in a non - local phase space of the spatial degrees of freedom of the entangled photons .",
    "this generalizes our previous result reported in ref .",
    "@xcite to the case of higher - order modes and two spatial dimensions .",
    "a fundamental characteristic of the spdc process is that the transverse profile of the pump field is transmitted to the two photons state @xcite . in the monochromatic and paraxial approximations ,",
    "the two photon state produced by spdc can be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the transverse wave vector of photon @xmath37 , and @xmath38 represents a single - photon state with well - defined frequency and polarization .",
    "the wave function in wave vector space is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the angular spectrum of the pump beam and @xmath41 is the phase matching function @xcite .",
    "let us assume that the down - converted photons are degenerate and quasi - collinear , so that the phase matching function simplifies to @xcite : @xmath42 $ ] , where @xmath43 is the wavelength of the pump beam and @xmath44 is the length of the crystal . using a gaussian spatial filter on the down - converter photons described in ref.@xcite we can tailor the phase matching function @xmath45 so it can be well approximated by a gaussian : @xmath46 , where the waist is given by @xmath47 .",
    "let us further assume that the pump beam is prepared in an hg mode @xmath48 , which is characterized by the wavelength @xmath43 and waist @xmath49 of the pump beam . in wave vector representation ,",
    "the hg beams are @xmath50},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the beam waist , @xmath51 is a hermite polynomial and @xmath52 is a constant @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the hg beam with wavelength @xmath43 and waist @xmath49 can be rewritten as @xmath53 . in this case",
    "the wave function is given by @xmath54 from here on , all hg and lg functions are characterized by the wavelength of the down - converted photons @xmath55 and waist @xmath56 . using @xmath57",
    "we can rewrite @xmath58 by the definition of the dhg modes ( [ eq : dhgef ] ) , we recognize that wave function ( [ eq : dhg ] ) is equivalent to @xmath59 wave function ( [ dhg2 ] ) is a product of dhg modes which appear in non - local coordinate planes composed of one spatial dimension of each down - converted photon .",
    "using expansions ( [ eq : dhggen ] ) and ( [ eq : lggen ] ) , we see that introducing relative phases of @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the @xmath6 and @xmath62 spatial dimensions of photon 2 , these dhg modes can be converted into lg modes .",
    "these relative phases can be introduced by a fourier transform operation on photon 2 as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite . indeed , as the hermite - gaussian functions are eigenfunctions of the fourier transform @xmath63 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath64=i^nhg_n$ ] , the two - photon wave function is transformed to @xmath65 thus , performing a bidimensional fourier transform on photon 1 implements the required relative phases .",
    "this operation can be viewed as a nonlocal mode converter , where the astigmatism is introduced between the spatial degrees of freedom of photons 1 and 2 , rather than the @xmath6 and @xmath62 coordinates of a single classical beam .",
    "we have presented a method to produce nonlocal optical vortices using entangled photon pairs produced in parametric down - conversion .",
    "the vortex appears in a coordinate plane composed of one spatial degree of freedom of one photon and the corresponding transverse wave vector degree of freedom of the other photon.we have shown that this kind of vortex is obtained from a nonlocal or  distributed \" mode converter in which a single lens is placed in each of the down - converted photons . pumping a nonlinear crystal with an appropriate @xmath66 beam ,",
    "produces a pair of nonlocal optical vortices of order @xmath9 and @xmath10 in different spatial directions .",
