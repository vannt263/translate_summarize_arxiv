    "the discovery of a new particle with properties compatible with those of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson and mass around 125  gev at cern s large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite was a major breakthrough .",
    "detailed information on the properties of this higgs boson was obtained from the measurements performed during run  i of the lhc at 78  tev center - of - mass energy  @xcite , making it possible to test a large variety of models of new physics .",
    "the results of the higgs searches at the lhc are usually given in terms of signal strengths , @xmath0 , which scale the number of signal events expected for the sm higgs boson .",

    "ii ) _ the higgs couplings are defined through a simple rescaling of the corresponding sm ones . in this talk we present a new public tool for performing a global fit to all available signal strength measurements , lilith  @xcite .",
    "it is a library written in python that can easily be used in any python script as well as in c and c++/root codes , and for which we also provide a command - line interface . as a primary input ,",
    "it uses signal strengths results for which the fundamental production and decay modes have been unfolded from experimental categories .",
    "the experimental results are stored in xml files , making it easy to modify and extend .",
    "the user input can be given in terms of reduced couplings or signal strengths , and is also specified in an xml format .",
    "each event category ( corresponding to a given set of selection criteria ) is sensitive to different combinations for production and decay of the sm higgs boson , with various efficiency factors . given this information , signal strength measurements can be combined and re - expressed after unfolding of the fundamental production and decay modes as @xmath1 for the different production modes @xmath2 and decay modes @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 of the sm higgs boson .",
    "results have been systematically given in terms of @xmath9 for the main decay modes probed by the atlas and cms collaborations .",

    "whenever available , full 1- or 2-dimensional likelihood functions are used as they make it possible to go beyond the gaussian approximation .",
    "all results are combined into a global likelihood function @xmath17 defined as the product of the individual likelihood functions .",
    "results given in terms of signal strengths , as in eq .",
    ", can be matched to new physics scenarios with the introduction of factors @xmath18 and @xmath19 that scale the amplitudes for the production and decay of the sm higgs boson , respectively , as follows : @xmath20 the factors @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be identified to ( or derived from ) reduced couplings appearing in an effective lagrangian  @xcite . in particular , the factors @xmath21 and @xmath22scaling gluon fusion and the decay into two photons , respectively  can be computed from the reduced couplings at lo or nlo qcd accuracy in lilith .",
    "it is also possible to specify decays into invisible and/or undetected particles . given this information , lilith computes the signal strengths ( alternatively they can be given directly as input ) and evaluates the global likelihood function .",
    "contraints can then be put on new physics scenarios in a frequentist or bayesian approach .",
    "lilith is a library written in python for constraining models of new physics against the lhc results .",
    "the code is distributed under the gnu general public license v3.0 .",
    "all necessary information on how to download and install it can be found on its official website  @xcite .",
    "lilith requires python  2.6 or more recent , but not the 3.x  series .",
    "the standard python scientific libraries , scipy and numpy , should furthermore be installed .",
    "lilith can be used in three different ways :    1 .   from a a python code or an interactive session of python , using the lilith application programming interface ( api ) ; 2 .   calling the command - line interface ( cli ) run_lilith.py from a shell",
    "; 3 .   or using the lilith interface to c and c++/root .",
    "all three methods are documented in  @xcite .",
    "a minimal example of use of the api is now presented :    ....   from lilith import *   lcal = lilith ( )   lcal.readexpinput ( )   lcal.readuserinputfile('userinput/example_mu.xml ' )   lcal.computelikelihood ( )   print ' -2log(likelihood ) = ' , lcal.l ....    after importing the lilith library , an object lcal is instantiated .",
    "the list of experimental results as well as the user input in xml format are then read with the methods readexpinput and readuserinputfile , respectively .",
    "finally , the likelihood is evaluated with the method computelikelihood and the result is printed on the screen .",
    "the xml user input file consists in either reduced couplings or signal strengths ( possibly with additional invisible or undetected decays ) for one or several states contributing to the signal .",
    "the root tag should be , and is followed by either or .",
    "for instance , scaling factors associated with the @xmath23 and @xmath24 processes can be specified as follows ,    .... < c to=\"bb\">1.2</c >",

    "we also provide a cli as well as an interface to c and c++/root in order to easily use lilith outside of a python script .",
    "all details and documentation are given in the manual  @xcite .",
    "the higgs likelihood used in lilith should be validated against official lhc results as approximations are made when reconstructing the full likelihood from 1- or 2-dimensional results . to this aim , we reproduce global fits to reduced couplings in various scenarios considered by atlas and cms . an example is given in fig .",
