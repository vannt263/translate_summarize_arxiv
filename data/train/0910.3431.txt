    "the top quark was discovered in 1995 at fermilab in the pair production mode ( @xmath0 events ) through strong interactions [ 1 ] . at the lhc",
    ", @xmath0 production takes place at small momentum fractions of the proton , @xmath3 where the gluon parton distribution function ( pdf ) is large .",
    "therefore , the gluon scattering process ( @xmath4 at 10 tev ) dominates over quark - antiquark scattering in @xmath0 production at the lhc . because of much larger parton luminosities ( dominated by the gluon pdf ) , the @xmath0 production cross - section , @xmath5 , at the lhc is significantly larger than at the tevatron . assuming @xmath6 gev and using cteq6.6 and cteq6.5 pdfs [ 2 ] , the @xmath0 cross - section at 10 tev is 400 pb@xmath711@xmath8 at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and 400 pb@xmath76@xmath8 at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) .",
    "any deviation in the measured cross - section from the theoretical value can be considered an indication of the presence of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "measurements of the @xmath0 cross - section in different channels ( @xmath9jets , @xmath10jets , @xmath11jets , di - leptons ) provide a more stringent test of standard model predictions , since new physics may modify relative fractions of these channels with respect to the total cross - section .",
    "top quark events will be a major background for higgs and supersymmetry ( susy ) searches .",
    "therefore , accurate knowledge of the @xmath0 cross - section is crucial during the early operation of the lhc to discover new physics .    in the standard model",
    ", the top quark decays almost exclusively through the @xmath12 decay . from the experimental point of view",
    ", we consider the case when one of the @xmath13 s decays leptonically , and the other decays hadronically ( @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 are light jets ) .",
    "this is known as a @xmath17-@xmath18 @xmath0 decay .",
    "this allows us to trigger events efficiently using the single lepton trigger .",
    "the final state of the semi - leptonic channel consists of a high-@xmath19 charged lepton , missing energy and four jets .",
    "this decay channel is usually called lepton+jets , and we will use this terminology in this paper .    several methods for the @xmath0 inclusive production cross - section measurement have been developed and carefully studied by the atlas collaboration [ 3 ] .",
    "all of these methods have the goal of an early @xmath0 cross - section measurement .",
    "measuring the @xmath0 cross - section using the likelihood method can be complementary to other analyses and therefore provides a valuable cross check of the early results .",
    "this method uses shapes of different kinematic variable distributions in @xmath0 and background events .",
    "we choose kinematic variables which have good separation power between @xmath0 and backgrounds .",
    "we optimize those discriminating variables to reduce statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "we have not used b - tagging [ 3 ] in this analysis .",
    "the discriminating function can be generally written as follows : @xmath20 where @xmath21 are discriminating variables and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are n - dimensional probability density functions for signal and background , respectively .",
    "we can assume to good approximation that the n discriminant variables are uncorrelated .",
    "therefore , each multidimensional probability density function can be expressed as a product of one dimensional probability density functions : @xmath24    denoting the fit to the logarithm of @xmath22 and @xmath23 as @xmath25 , we can write the likelihood discriminant as @xmath26",
    "the @xmath0 production cross - section is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of selected @xmath0 events , @xmath29 is the branching ratio for the final state considered , @xmath30 is the integrated luminosity and @xmath31 is the selection efficiency .",
    "we have used semi - leptonic decays of @xmath0 events ( @xmath32 with @xmath15 ) for this analysis . in this section ,",
    "we define basic reconstructed objects ( electrons , muons , jets and missing transverse energy ) used in this analysis .",
    "these definitions are based upon the standard reconstruction algorithms recommended in atlas .",
    "the pseudorapidity is defined as @xmath33 = -@xmath34 tan@xmath35 where @xmath36 is the polar angle from the beam axis .",
    "the azimuthal angle @xmath37 is measured around the beam axis .",
    "we define separation of two objects in @xmath38 space as @xmath39 .",
    "electrons are reconstructed in the inner tracker and in the calorimeter of the atlas detector .",
    "electrons are required to have pseudo - rapidity in the range @xmath40 2.47 and @xmath41 gev .",
    "furthermore , if an electron is found in the calorimeter crack region @xmath42 , the electron is discarded .",
    "the electron has to be isolated based on the calorimeter energy : the additional transverse energy ( @xmath43 ) in a cone with radius @xmath44 around the electron axis is required to be less than @xmath45 gev .",
    "muons are reconstructed by combining information from the inner detector and the muon spectrometer .",
    "the muons used in this analysis must have minimum transverse momentum @xmath41 gev and are required to lie in the pseudo - rapidity range @xmath46 .",
    "muons are isolated based on the calorimeter energy : the additional transverse energy @xmath43 in a cone with radius @xmath44 around the muon is required to be less than @xmath45 gev . in order to remove muons coming from decays of hadrons inside jets ( i.e. , @xmath23-hadrons originating from the @xmath47-quark in top quark decays ) , muons which are within a cone of size @xmath48 from a jet are removed .",
    "jets are reconstructed using the standard atlas cone algorithm [ 3 ] in @xmath38 space , with a cone radius of 0.4 .",
    "the jets used in this analysis are required to have minimum transverse momentum @xmath41 gev and are required to lie in the pseudo - rapidity range @xmath46 .",
    "jets which overlap with electrons within a cone of size @xmath49 are discarded .      for the calculation of missing transverse energy @xmath50",
    ", we determine the sum of the following components : the contribution of cells in identified electron or photon clusters , the contribution of cells inside jets , the contribution of cells in topological clusters outside identified objects , the contribution from muons and the cryostat correction [ 3 ] .",
    "the sum of total transverse energy in semi - leptonic top quark events is about 500 gev , which gives a typical @xmath50 resolution of the order of 10 gev [ 3 ] .",
    "we identify semi - leptonic @xmath0 events by requiring that either the single isolated electron or single isolated muon trigger , both with 15 gev thresholds , have fired .",
    "the trigger efficiencies can be measured either from mc simulation or from data ( @xmath51 or @xmath52 ) [ 3 ] .    apart from the trigger requirement , the following additional event selection cuts have been applied for event selection :    * exactly one isolated lepton ( electron or muon ) with @xmath53 gev .",
    "* @xmath5420 gev . * at least 3 jets with @xmath5540 gev . * at least 4 jets with @xmath5520 gev .",
    "the fraction of all @xmath0 events passing the individual selection requirements and overall commulative efficiency are shown in table  i.    .*cut flow efficiency for the @xmath0 decay . * [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : syst_err_1 ]",
    "the @xmath0 cross - section measurement using the likelihood method has been discussed . during early lhc operation",
    "the atlas detector will not be well understood .",
    "no b - tagging is used in this analysis .",
    "we have chosen likelihood variables that do not depend on jet energy scale and missing energy so that we can use them during early lhc operation and we can minimize systematic uncertainties . as a result , the dominant systematic error ( jet energy scale ) is reduced by a factor of two compared to a cut - based analysis [ 4 ] .",
    "the @xmath0 cross - section measurement at 50 pb@xmath2 using the likelihood method can be measured with the following accuracy :    * * @xmath10jets channel ( for @xmath7 5@xmath8 jes ) * : @xmath56 * * @xmath10jets channel ( for @xmath7 10@xmath8 jes ) * : @xmath57 * * @xmath9jets channel ( for @xmath7 5@xmath8 jes ) * : @xmath58 * * @xmath9jets channel ( for @xmath7 10@xmath8 jes ) * : @xmath59    9 [ 1 ] cdf coll .",
