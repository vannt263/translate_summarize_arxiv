    "attaching sequences of matrix algebras to a given manifold @xmath5 to describe a non - commutative and approximate version of its ring of smooth functions has now become a rather important tool in non - commutative field theory : more precisely , for each positive integer @xmath6 let @xmath7 be a complex linear surjective map of the ring of smooth functions on @xmath5 into the space of all complex @xmath8-matrices such that products of functions are approximately mapped to products of matrices in the limit @xmath9 . in almost all cases",
    ", @xmath10 carries a poisson bracket @xmath11 ( for instance if @xmath5 is symplectic such as every orientable riemann surface ) , and one further demands that poisson brackets are approximately mapped to matrix commutators in the limit @xmath9 .    for the @xmath12-sphere @xmath13 this was done in 1982 in @xcite : using the classical fact that the space of all spherical harmonics of fixed @xmath14 is in bijection with the space of all harmonic polynomials in @xmath15 of degree @xmath14 and substituting the three commuting variables by @xmath16-dimensional representations of the three - dimensional lie algebra @xmath17 allows to define a map from functions on @xmath13 to @xmath18 matrices , that sends poisson brackets to matrix commutators .",
    "the result was dubbed `` fuzzy sphere '' , in @xcite .",
    "the papers @xcite prove that the ( complexified ) poisson algebra of functions on _ any _ riemann surface arises as a @xmath19 limit of @xmath20  which had been conjectured in @xcite .",
    "this result was extended to any quantizable compact khler manifold in @xcite , the technical tool being geometric and berezin - toeplitz quantization .",
    "insight on how matrices can encode topological information ( certain sequences having been identifiable as converging to a particular function , but @xmath20 lacking topological invariants ) was gained in @xcite .",
    "the above general results , however , are merely existence proofs : there are only two rather explicit formulas , for the two - sphere @xcite and for the two - torus @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which are quite different since the former uses the natural embedding of the two - sphere into @xmath15 whereas the latter relies on the fact that the two - torus is a quotient @xmath21 . the general results are based on the complex nature of any compact orientable riemann surface .    in this paper , we should like to propose an approach which to the best of our knowledge seems to have been neglected in the literature so far , despite its rather intuitive appeal : we are using the ` visualisable ' embedding of a compact orientable riemann surface @xmath0 into @xmath15 explicitly given by the set of all zeros of a real polynomial @xmath22 .",
    "the function @xmath22 then defines a poisson bracket in @xmath15 by the formula @xmath23 for two real - valued smooth functions @xmath24 defined on @xmath15 . since @xmath22 is a casimir function for the bracket @xmath25 , one gets a symplectic poisson bracket on @xmath0 by restriction .",
    "the idea now is to use the above poisson bracket on @xmath15 to first define an infinite - dimensional non - commutative algebra as a quotient algebra of the free algebra in three non - commuting variables by means of relations involving @xmath25 and a real parameter @xmath26 . in a second step",
    "the resulting algebra is divided by an ideal generated by the constraint polynomial @xmath22 thus giving a non - commutative version of the functions on @xmath0 . in a third step matrix representations of any size @xmath6 of this latter algebra are constructed where the parameter @xmath26 takes specific values depending on @xmath6 .",
    "it is noteworthy that we do not depend on the zero set of @xmath22 to be a regular surface .",
    "thus , even for a singular surface ( e.g. , in the transition from sphere to torus ) the non - commutative analogue is still well defined .",
    "the main result of this paper is an explicit construction for the the two - torus and a transition region for a two - torus emerging out of a no longer round two - sphere following the above programme .",
    "encouraged by the explicit construction and by the fact that for the two - torus our results almost coincide with the older results of @xcite , we are quite optimistic that for the case of genus @xmath27 this embedding approach may give more explicit constructions than the existence proof in @xcite and @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows : + in section [ sec : surface_construction ] we describe riemann surfaces of genus @xmath28 embedded in @xmath29 as inverse images of polynomial constraint - functions , @xmath30 .",
    "the above - mentioned poisson bracket @xmath25 on @xmath15 is treated in section [ sec : pois_brack_r3 ] where the bracket restricts to a symplectic bracket on the embedded riemann surface @xmath0 .    in section [ sec : torusandsphere ]",
    "step one and two of the above programme is explicitly proven for a polynomial constraint @xmath22 describing the two - sphere , the two - torus , and a transition region : we give a system of relations ( eqs ( [ eq : xy ] ) , ( [ eq : yz ] ) , ( [ eq : zx ] ) ) , and show that this system satisfies the hypothesis of the diamond lemma , thus proving that the non - commutative algebra carries a multiplication which is a converging deformation of the pointwise multiplication of polynomials in three commuting variables ( see proposition [ prop : torusdiamondlemma ] ) .    in the central section [ sec : reptorusandsphere ]",
    "we completely classify all the finite - dimensional representations of the algebras constructed in the preceding section ( two - sphere , two - torus , and transition ) which are hermitian in the sense that the variables @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are sent to hermitian @xmath18-matrices .",
    "the main technical tool is graph - theory describing the non - zero entries of the matrices .",
    "next , in section [ sec : eigenvaluesequence ] , we confirm that the eigenvalue sequences of these representations reflect topology in the sense suggested in @xcite .",
    "the final section [ sec : geoquanttorus ] compares the classification results of section [ sec : reptorusandsphere ] in case of the two - torus with the older ones obtained in @xcite : it is shown that the two completely different methods give almost the same result .",
    "the aim of this section is to present compact connected riemann surfaces of any genus embedded in @xmath29 by inverse images of polynomials . for this purpose",
    "we use the regular value theorem and morse theory .",

    "what are the conditions on @xmath22 , for @xmath0 to be a genus @xmath28 riemann surface ? if the restriction of @xmath22 to @xmath0 is a submersion , then @xmath0 is an orientable submanifold of @xmath29 .",

    "the @xmath47 function is defined as the restriction of the first projection on the surface .",
    "it is not necessarily a morse function ( one has to choose a `` good '' embedding for that ) , but the singular points are those for which the gradient @xmath48 is parallel to the @xmath49 axis .",
    "moreover the hessian matrix of @xmath47 at such a point @xmath37 is : @xmath50 take @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "thanks to the fact that @xmath66 never vanishes at a singular point , this also shows that @xmath47 is a genuine morse function . finally , @xmath67 if the polynomial @xmath59 has exactly 2 simple roots and the polynomial @xmath60 has exactly @xmath68 simple roots , then @xmath69 and @xmath0 is a surface of genus @xmath28 .",
