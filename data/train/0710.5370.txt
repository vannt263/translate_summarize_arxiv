    "our goal is to discuss the statistics of conductance and shot - noise power for chaotic cavities using essentially the properties of selberg s integral .",
    "the static conductance @xmath7 relates linearly the time averaged current @xmath8 to the external voltage @xmath9 between two electron reservoirs .",
    "fluctuations of the current around its mean value are conventionally described by the spectral noise power @xmath10 , with @xmath11 .",
    "as temperature goes to zero , the only source of noise that remains non - vanishing is related to the discreteness of the electric charge carriers , the so - called shot - noise . for mesoscopic conductors , an adequate framework for the problematic is based on random - matrix - theory ( rmt ) approach to quantum transport , we refer to @xcite for reviews .",
    "we consider a chaotic cavity with two attached leads supporting @xmath12 and @xmath13 channels , respectively , and coupled perfectly to the interior of the cavity .",
    "according to the landauer - bttiker formalism , the conductance @xmath7 and the shot - noise power @xmath14 can be expressed in terms of the transmission eigenvalues @xmath15 as follows : @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the conductance quantum and @xmath19 .",
    "the positive numbers @xmath20 are the @xmath21 non - zero eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath22 , with the transmission matrix @xmath23 being the @xmath24 submatrix of the full scattering matrix and consisting of transition amplitudes from @xmath12 left to @xmath13 right channels . for chaotic cavities , universal fluctuations of @xmath15 can be described by rmt @xcite .",
    "considering the moments of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the exact ( rmt ) results valid at arbitrary channel numbers @xmath2 and repulsion parameter @xmath25 were reported in the literature only for the average and variance of the conductance @xcite : @xmath26 @xmath27 and very recently for the average shot - noise power @xcite : @xmath28 to derive these results in a uniform way , it is convenient to use the known expression for the joint probability density of transmission eigenvalues @xmath15 @xcite @xmath29 to perform the corresponding integrations on eqs .",
    "( [ g])([p ] ) .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath30 above is given by @xmath31 and assures that ( [ jpd ] ) is a probability density .",
    "it is known for discrete positive @xmath32 and continuous @xmath33 and @xmath25 as selberg s integral @xcite .    as to the distribution functions",
    ", simple closed expressions can be obtained for the conductance distribution at @xmath34 @xcite and for the shot - noise distribution at @xmath35 only @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no general results valid at arbitrary @xmath2 and @xmath25 have been presented thus far .",
    "to study the cumulants of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , one needs to know what are the moments @xmath36 , with @xmath37 standing for the integration over the joint probability density ( [ jpd ] ) and @xmath38 . moments with all @xmath39 as well as @xmath40 can be found from recursion relations already given in mehta s book @xcite that come from the selberg s integral theory .",
    "the latter can be successfully applied @xcite to derive results ( [ < g>])([<p > ] ) .",
    "this approach was recently extended further to find @xmath41 and @xmath42 exactly @xcite . here",
    ", we have calculated all moments with @xmath43 by using tricks of partial integrations to reduce all moments to forms of selberg s integral .",
    "we will report on that in more detail elsewhere @xcite . by this method",
    "we are able to calculate the so - called skewness ( third cumulant ) of the conductance , which we represent in the following compact form : @xmath44 } { \\beta(n-3 + \\frac{2}{\\beta } ) ( n-1+\\frac{2}{\\beta})(n-1+\\frac{6}{\\beta})}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is worth noting that the skewness vanishes for symmetric cavities ( @xmath45 ) at @xmath46 .",
    "this also holds for any odd cumulant of the conductance , as the conductance distribution becomes symmetric around @xmath47 in this case . ) at @xmath48 by the change of all @xmath49 in @xmath50 . ]",
    "we have also calculated the kurtosis @xmath51 of the conductance ( which is the fourth cumulant of @xmath0 ) and the variance @xmath52 of the shot - noise power ( the second cumulant ) .",
    "these expressions are given explicitly but are too lengthy to be reported here . in the case of the single - mode leads , @xmath35 , one gets @xmath53 and @xmath54 at the values of @xmath55 , 2 , 4 , respectively . in the opposite semiclassical limit of large channel numbers , @xmath56 ,",
    "we write the results as the following @xmath57 expansions : @xmath58 \\\\ & & + { \\cal o } ( 1/n^4)\\ , , \\label{<g^4 > } \\\\ \\nonumber \\frac{\\mathrm{var}(p)}{\\langle p \\rangle } & = & \\frac{2}{\\beta n^5 } \\bigl [ n_1 ^ 4 + n_2 ^ 4 - 4 n_1 n_2 ( n_1-n_2)^2 \\\\ \\nonumber & & + \\frac{\\beta-2}{\\beta n } \\bigl ( 9(n_1 ^ 4 + n_2 ^ 4 ) - 42n_1n_2(n_1 ^ 2 +   n_2 ^ 2 ) + 70n_1 ^ 2 n_1 ^ 2 \\bigr ) \\bigr ] \\\\ & & + { \\cal o } ( 1/n^3)\\ , .",
    "\\label{varp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can readily see that higher cumulants contribute at least in the next order of @xmath59 , so that the full distributions get more gaussian - like as @xmath60 grows .",
    "this tendency becomes even stronger for the conductance distribution in symmetric cavities at @xmath46 , as @xmath61 vanishes then in the leading and next - to - leading orders . in this case of symmetric cavities , @xmath62 , we can further find : @xmath63",
    "finally , we discuss shortly the distribution of the conductance , @xmath64 and that of the shot - noise power , @xmath65 , deferring a detailed consideration to a separate publication @xcite . writing the functions @xmath66 and @xmath67 as fourier series over the interval of support , we obtain , e.g. , for the conductance distribution the following representation : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is known at @xmath3 .",
    "for example , @xmath70 is given by the imaginary part of the determinant of the following matrix : @xmath71 in a similar way we may write @xmath72 and @xmath73 as imaginary parts of certain pfaffians .",
    "the sum ( [ prob ] ) can be done numerically where care has to be taken for the pfaffians , which may equivalently be written as quaternion determinants of certain self - dual antisymmetric matrices , which are easier to be calculated .",
    "analogous expressions are also obtained for @xmath74 .     the conductance distribution at @xmath55 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 9 ( from left to right).,width=264 ]    it is worth noting that at any finite @xmath32 these distributions are continuous but not analytic functions everywhere .",
    "nonanalyticity in the distribution of conductances in quasi - one - dimensional wires ( the cusp point at @xmath77 ) was recently reported in @xcite , see also @xcite . in the present context of chaotic cavities , it can be understood from the following geometrical consideration . in the case of @xmath66 , calculating the average amounts to an integration over an ( @xmath78)dimensional plane @xmath79 cut by the @xmath32dimensional cube @xmath80 , such that there appear ( sometimes weak ) singularities at all points @xmath81 with an integer @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "a similar situation appears also for @xmath67 . here",
    ", we integrate over the ( @xmath78)dimensional sphere @xmath84 and singularities appear whenever the sphere touches one edge or surface of the cube , that is for @xmath85 with @xmath83 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates the conductance distribution at @xmath55 keeping @xmath75 fixed and varying @xmath13 from 1 to 9 . in figure [ fig2 ] , we plot the distribution of the shot - noise power at @xmath86 , keeping @xmath87 fixed and varying @xmath13 from 2 to 14 . in both cases one can see the tendency of the distributions to get peaked around the mean values , so that in the bulk they can be effectively described by a gaussian with the known mean and variance , see eqs .",

    "we are able to give some exact asymptotics near the edges of support of the distributions expressed in terms of exact integrals , which are related to some general forms of selberg s integral .",
    "for example , for @xmath4 we find @xmath90 where the proportionality factor is exactly known .",
    "this result follows easily from calculating the powers of @xmath0 in @xmath91 under scaling of all @xmath92 and noticing that the upper integration limit of @xmath93 remains unchanged ( @xmath94 ) as long as @xmath95 .",
    "similarly , @xmath96 behaves near the upper edge as follows : @xmath97 for the distribution of the shot - noise power , one finds @xmath98 whereas near the lower edge ( @xmath99 ) the asymptotics is a bit more complicated , since the contribution of the corners of the cube of integration become disconnected .",
    "these expressions can be extended outside the regions specified above , being valid then in a linear order in distances from the edges .",
    "the expansions can even be improved and all constants can be given explicitly as expressions containing products of gamma functions from selberg s integral .",
    "the distribution of the shot - noise power ( dashed line ) and corresponding asymptotics ( full lines ) at @xmath100 and @xmath75 , @xmath88.,width=264 ]    in figure [ fig3 ] , we show as an example the distribution of the shot - noise power at @xmath101 , @xmath75 , @xmath88 ( dashed line ) with calculated asymptotics near the edges ( full lines ) . indicated as dots are the average @xmath102 and @xmath103 known exactly . we have also compared ( and found a perfect agreement ) all the expressions with numerical simulations of the rmt statistics of @xmath15 and resulting distributions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in summary , we have applied essentially the theory of selberg s integral to the problems of quantum transport in chaotic cavities .",
    "the cumulants up to the forth order for the conductance and up to the second order for the shot - noise power have been calculated exactly at arbitrary channel numbers and repulsion parameter @xmath25 .",
    "we have also given the conductance and shot - noise distributions in closed form suitable for subsequent analytic analysis ( e.g. , finding asymptotics ) as well as for numerical implementations .",
    "it would be desirable to compare our findings with relevant experimental results , e.g. , in microwave cavities which became available recently @xcite . this could , however , be not so straightforward , as it requires taking into account effects of dephasing @xcite and absorption @xcite as well .",
