    "centaurus a ( ngc 5128 ) is the nearest ( d = 3.5 mpc ; 1 @xmath117  pc , hui et al . 1993 ) example of a giant elliptical galaxy associated with a powerful radio source .",
    "the large - scale radio morphology consists of twin radio lobes separated by @xmath1 5 degrees on the sky .",
    "the compact ( @xmath1 milliarcsecond ) radio nucleus is variable and has a strong jet extending @xmath1 4 arcminutes towards the northeast lobe .",
    "the spectacular optical appearance is that of a giant elliptical galaxy that appears enveloped in a nearly edge on , warped dust lane . there is also a series of faint optical shells .",
    "the stellar population in the dominant elliptical structure is old , whilst that of the twisted dust lane is young , sporadically punctuated by hii regions , dust and gas ( graham 1979 ) .",
    "the overall structure of cen a resembles that of a recent ( @xmath9 years , tubbs 1980 ) merger , between a spiral and a large elliptical galaxy .",
    "the dust lane is the source of most ( 90 % ) of the far - infrared luminosity ( l@xmath10 l@xmath11 ) and is thought to be re - radiated starlight from young stars in the dusty disk ( joy et al .",
    "1988 ) .    in sect .",
    "2 we describe the observations and data analysis . sect .",
    "3 looks at the general fir properties and proceeds to model the hii regions and the pdrs in the dust lane .",
    "4 summarises the results and presents our conclusions .",
    "cen a was observed with the lws grating ( @xmath12 ) as part of the lws consortium s guaranteed time extragalactic programme . a full grating observation ( 43 - 196.7 @xmath0 m )",
    "was taken of the nucleus at the centre of the dust lane and a series of line observations were taken at two positions in the se and nw regions of the dust lane .",
    "a short  157 @xmath0 m line observation was taken off - source at position # 4 ( see table 1 ) to estimate the galactic emission near the source .",
    "position # 1 was intended to provide a deeper integration coincident with position # 2 , but was accidently offset .",
    "a series of half - second integration ramps were taken at each grating position with four samples per resolution element ( @xmath13 m @xmath14 m and @xmath15 m @xmath16 m ) .",
    "the total integration time per resolution element and per pointing were : position # 1 88  s for the 52  @xmath0 m and 34  s for the 57  @xmath0 m ; position # 2 ( the centre ) , 30  s for the range 43196 @xmath0 m ; positions nw and se ( 2 point raster map ) 22  s for the the 63  @xmath0 m , 14  s for the 88  @xmath0 m , 12  s for the 122  @xmath0 m , 28  s for the 145  @xmath0 m and 12  s for the 158  @xmath0 m ; position # 4 12  s for the 158  @xmath0 m .",
    "the data were processed with ral pipeline 7 and analysed using the lia and isap packages . the lws flux calibration and relative spectral response function ( rsrf )",
    "were derived from observations of uranus ( swinyard et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the full grating spectrum at the centre enabled us to estimate the relative flux uncertainty between individual detectors arising from uncertainties in the relative responsivity and the dark - current subtraction . the offsets between the detectors ( excluding detector sw1 ) was @xmath17 % .",
    "the 88 @xmath0 m line on detectors sw5 and lw1 had a 15 % systematic uncertainty and the line on detectors lw3 and lw4 had a 10 % systematic uncertainty .",
    "we therefore adopt a relative flux uncertainty of @xmath1 15% . because we only took spectra of individual lines at the nw and se positions there is no corresponding overlap in wavelength coverage at these positions",
    ". one indicator of relative flux uncertainty is a discrete step down in flux , of @xmath1 25 % , at @xmath1 125  @xmath0 m at the se position .",
    "the relative flux uncertainty is assumed to be @xmath18 25 % at these positions .",
    "the absolute flux calibration w.r.t .",
    "uranus for point like objects observed on axis is better than 15 % ( swinyard et al .",
    "1998 ) . however , extended sources give rise either to channel fringes or to a spectrum that is not a smooth function of wavelength .",
    "this is still a calibration issue .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "2 , detectors sw5 , lw1 , lw2 have slopes that differ from those of their neighbours in the overlap region .",
    "this may account for the continuum shape , which is discussed in sect .",
    "the lws beam profile is known to be asymmetric and is still under investigation .",
    "we therefore adopt a value for the fwhm of 70  at all wavelengths , believing that a more sophisticated treatment would not significantly affect our conclusions .",
    "we also note that there is good cross calibration between the iso - lws results and the far - infrared imaging fabry - perot interferometer ( fifi ) ( madden et al .",
    "1995 ) ; the peak fluxes agree to within @xmath1 10 % .    .",
    "observation log [ cols= \" < , > , > , < \" , ]     the results for the three regions are consistent with each other , having a gas density , n @xmath1 10@xmath19 @xmath7 , and an incident far - uv field , g @xmath1 10@xmath20 .    at the nw position , only the combination of the 63 @xmath0 m / 158 @xmath0 m ratio and the ( 63 @xmath0 m + 158 @xmath0 m ) /fir continuum ratio gives a meaningful solution for g and n. the 146 @xmath0 m line is clearly detected but with a very rippled baseline due to channel fringes .",
    "the observed 146 @xmath0 m line flux would need to be reduced by @xmath1 60 % in order to obtain a consistent result with the 146 @xmath0 m / 63 @xmath0 m line ratio predicted by the pdr model .",
    "the lws results for the nucleus confirm those previously derived from ir , submm and co observations .",
    "the consistent set of derived pdr conditions for all three positions suggest that the observed fir emission in a 70  beam centred on the nucleus is dominated by star formation and not agn activity .",
    "joy et al .",
    "( 1988 ) mapped cen a at 50 and 100 @xmath0 m on the kao .",
    "they concluded that the extended fir emission was from dust grains heated by massive young stars distributed throughout the dust lane , not the compact nucleus .",
    "hawarden et al .",
    "( 1993 ) mapped cen a at 800 @xmath0 m and 450 @xmath0 m with a resolution of @xmath110 .",
    "they attribute the large scale 800 @xmath0 m emission to thermal emission from regions of star formation embedded in the dust lane .",
    "they note that the h@xmath21 emission within a few arcseconds of the nucleus , observed by israel et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , indicates that significant uv radiation from the nucleus does not reach large radii in the plane of the dust lane i.e. the nuclear contribution to exciting the extended gas and dust disk is small .",
    "eckart et al . ( 1990 ) and wild et al .",
    "( 1997 ) mapped cen a in @xmath22co j=1 - 0 , @xmath22co j=2 - 1 and @xmath23co j=1 - 0 .",
    "all three maps have two peaks separated by @xmath1 90 centred on the nucleus .",
    "it is interesting to note that our se position only clips the lowest contours of the co ( 1 - 0 ) and co ( 2 - 1 ) maps of wild et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in spite of this",
    "the derived pdr parameters are consistent with those encompassing the bulk of the molecular emission .",
    "there must be extended low level co ( 1 - 0 ) emission beyond the sensitivity limits of the wild et al .",
    "( 1997 ) maps .",
    "the lowest contour is 17.5 k kms@xmath24 , corresponding to m@xmath25 @xmath1 10@xmath26 m@xmath11 if the material filled the lws beam .",
    "we present the first full fir spectrum from 43 - 196.7 @xmath0 m of cen a. we detect seven fine structure lines ( see table 2 ) , the strongest being those generated in pdrs . at the central position ,",
    "the total flux in the far - infrared lines is @xmath1 1 % of the total fir luminosity ( l@xmath27 l@xmath11 for a distance of 3.5 mpc ) .",
    "the line flux is @xmath10.4 % fir and the line flux is @xmath1 0.2 % fir .",
    "these are typical values for starburst galaxies ( lord et al .",
    "the 52 @xmath0 m / 88 @xmath0 m line intensity ratio is @xmath1 0.9 , which corresponds to an electron density , n@xmath28 100 @xmath7 ( rubin et al .",
    "the _ thermal pressure _ of the ionized medium in the cen a dust lane is closer to that of starburst galaxies ( n@xmath29 250 @xmath7 in m82 ( colbert et al .",
    "1999 ) and m83 ( stacey et al . 1999 ) ) than that of the milky way ( n@xmath29 3 @xmath7 ( pettuchowski & bennett 1993 ) ) .",
    "the / line intensity ratio is @xmath1 1.6 , giving an abundance ratio n++/n+ @xmath1 0.3 , which corresponds to an effective temperature , t@xmath30 35500 k ( rubin et al . 1994 ) . assuming a coeval starburst , then the tip of the main sequence is headed by o8.5 stars , and the starburst is @xmath1 6 @xmath4 years old .",
    "if the burst in cen a was triggered by the spiral - elliptical galaxy merger then its occurance was very recent .",
    "alternatively , the merger triggered a series of bursts of star formation and we are witnessing the most recent activity .",
    "we estimate that the n / o abundance ratio is @xmath1 0.2 in the hii regions in cen a. this value is consistent with the range of @xmath1 0.2 - 0.3 found for galactic hii regions ( rubin et al .",
    "n / o is a measure of the chemical evolution and we expect it to increase with time ( c.f . the solar value of @xmath1 0.12 ) .",
    "we estimate that @xmath1 10 % of the observed arises in the wim .",
    "the cnm contributes very little ( @xmath31 % ) emission at our beam positions .",
    "the bulk of the emission is from the pdrs .",
    "we derive the average physical conditions for the pdrs in cen a for the first time .",
    "there is active star formation throughout the dust lane and in regions beyond the bulk of the molecular material .",
    "the fir emission in the 70  lws beam at the nucleus is dominated by emission from star formation rather than agn activity . on scales of @xmath1 1",
    "kpc the average physical properties of the pdrs are modelled with a gas density , n @xmath1 10@xmath19 @xmath7 , an incident far - uv field , g @xmath1 10@xmath20 and a gas temperature of @xmath1 250 k.",
