    "in the absence of convincing signals of new physics at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , the attention needs to be turned to non - minimal models giving non - standard signatures that are easy to miss by conventional searches .",
    "one example of such unexplored signals is a triboson resonance , that is , a cascade decay of a heavy resonance @xmath0 into a ( massive ) vector boson @xmath1 and an intermediate resonance @xmath2 , which subsequently decays into another vector boson @xmath3 plus an extra particle @xmath4 .",
    "the latter particle can also be a vector boson , a higgs boson , or a new particle , as depicted in figure  [ fig : diag ] .",
    "this type of signal was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to explain a @xmath5 excess in a search of hadronically decaying diboson resonances by the atlas collaboration in run 1 data  @xcite that was much milder in the analogous cms search  @xcite and did not show up in semileptonic final states  @xcite . despite the atlas and cms searches in hadronic final states",
    "had similar performance for true diboson resonances , this was not the case for a non - diboson signal , e.g. a triboson : the atlas event selection criteria would make it show up as a peak in the @xmath6 diboson invariant mass distribution while for the cms analysis it would appear as a wide bump , harder to notice over the background .",
    "in addition , the presence of the extra particle @xmath4 could drastically reduce the signal efficiency for the searches in semileptonic final states .",
    "subsequently , it was shown that triboson signals can arise in the context of left - right models  @xcite , with the new charged boson @xmath7 being the heavy resonance @xmath0 , and the extra scalars @xmath8 , @xmath9 playing the role of the intermediate resonance @xmath2 .",
    "the extra particle @xmath4 can be a vector boson , the higgs boson or the pseudo - scalar @xmath10 .",
    "for example , one can have @xmath11 , or @xmath12 .",
    "quadriboson signals are also possible , with the heavy resonance ( @xmath7 or also @xmath13 in this context ) decaying into two heavy scalars , which subsequently decay as depicted in figure  [ fig : diag2 ] .",
    "for example , one can have @xmath14 .",
    "a more detailed simulation  @xcite confirmed that a potential @xmath15 triboson signal would be hard to see in semileptonic final states due to the low signal efficiency that results because the analyses are highly optimised for the kinematics of diboson resonances produced back - to - back in the transverse plane .",
    "moreover , the event selection criteria often veto the presence of extra particles near the decay products of the boson with leptonic decay , to suppress sm backgrounds such as @xmath16 and @xmath17 plus jets .",
    "this obviously removes a large fraction of a @xmath18 signal .",
    "also , in the fully leptonic channels the branching ratios are quite small , and the produced signals are tiny .",
    "( note that if the extra particle @xmath4 is not a sm gauge boson and decays hadronically , the only leptons result from the decay of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 bosons . )",
    "the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite also confirmed that in hadronic final states a significant peak shaping would be produced by the atlas event selection  @xcite but not in the cms analyses  @xcite , where the excess in the diboson invariant mass distribution would remain as a wide bump .",
    "as it has been argued before  @xcite , such wide bumps are not easy to spot in searches where the background itself is determined from data . in this work",
    "we address this specific point in detail , whose interest extends far beyond the interpretation of possible anomalies .",
    "in fact , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , triboson and quadriboson resonances are a natural possibility in models with several extra particles at different scales , with left - right models being only an example . and , as we will see , wide excesses such as those caused by multiboson resonances are easily absorbed in the ( unknown ) normalisation of the background .",
    "we begin by describing in section  [ sec:2 ] the typical profiles of the diboson invariant mass distributions for triboson and quadriboson signals . after this , in section  [ sec:3 ] we discuss the framework used to set limits on possible new resonances . in section  [ sec:4 ]",
    "we show to which extent the standard diboson searches are ( in)sensitive to wide bumps caused by multiboson signals , parameterised by typical shapes obtained from simulation , and we compare to what one would expect for resonances with a gaussian shape .",
    "we summarise our results and discuss their implications in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "for triboson resonance cascade decays , such as the one depicted in figure  [ fig : diag ] , the invariant mass distribution @xmath21 of the decay products @xmath1 and @xmath3 is very wide at the partonic level .",
    "an example is shown in figure  [ fig : dist - tribp ] , taken for resonance masses @xmath22 tev , @xmath23 gev , and boson mases @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 gev .",
    "gev assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite was inspired by an excess in a search for @xmath27 resonances at this mass  @xcite , which has not been confirmed with more data  @xcite .",
    "we take this value merely for illustration and consistency with earlier work . ] neglecting width effects and working at first order in @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the minimum and maximum values are @xmath31 if the intermediate particle is allowed to be very wide these values are shifted , recovering the upper limit for a three - body decay in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in actual diboson resonance searches the invariant mass distribution of a potential triboson signal",
    "is shaped in varying degrees by the selection criteria applied on the transverse momentum @xmath32 , rapidity @xmath33 , rapidity difference @xmath34 , and @xmath32 balance of the bosons , as well as by the jet quality requirements .",
    "as aforementioned , in this paper we focus on the situations where the resulting signal distribution is a wide bump , and so we have selected two representative distributions that were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite after the event selection and reconstruction criteria .",
    "figure  [ fig : dist - trib ] ( left ) shows a symmetric bump obtained with the event selection of the atlas @xmath35 search in the hadronic final state  @xcite , namely for the @xmath36 selection .",
    "the right panel shows an asymmetric bump obtained with the high - purity @xmath37 event selection of the cms run 2 diboson search ( 2015 data ) in the hadronic final state  @xcite .",
    "these two triboson signal shapes will be used in our subsequent analyses .",
    "cc +    for quadriboson cascade decays as the one in figure  [ fig : diag2 ] the invariant mass distribution of the decay products @xmath1 and @xmath3 is also very wide at the partonic level , and less prone to shaping by kinematical cuts .",
    "we consider for simplicity that the masses of the two intermediate particles are equal , @xmath38 , and that the extra particle @xmath4 is the same in both decays . the invariant mass distribution for @xmath22 tev , @xmath23 gev , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 gev is shown in figure  [ fig : dist - quadp ] .",
    "neglecting again width effects and working at first order in @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the minimum and maximum values are @xmath39 \\left ( 1- \\frac{2 m_x^2}{m_y^2 } \\right ) + m_1 ^ 2 + m_2 ^ 2 \\ , , \\notag \\\\ & ( m_{12}^2)^\\text{max } = \\left [ m_r^2 \\ , \\frac{1+\\sqrt{1 - 4 \\ , m_y^2/m_r^2}}{2 } -m_y^2 \\right ] \\left ( 1- \\frac{2 m_x^2}{m_y^2 } \\right ) + m_1 ^ 2 + m_2 ^ 2 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as example of a quadriboson signal shape we take the distribution in figure  [ fig : dist - quad ] , obtained with the high - purity @xmath37 event selection of the cms run 2 diboson search in the hadronic final state  @xcite .",
    "as anticipated , the shaping is not very significant for quadriboson signals and for this event selection the only visible difference with the distribution at the partonic level is the cut of the distribution at @xmath40 tev .",
    "this example does not display any maximum at the range of invariant masses of interest .",
    "for other heavy resonance and/or intermediate resonance masses , the maximum could be within the invariant mass interval studied , but we expect that even in that case the effect would be similar because the width of the quadriboson bumps is really large , more than for triboson bumps .",
    "in many searches for narrow resonances decaying into two objects the background smoothly decreases with the invariant mass of the two objects ( in our case of interest the diboson pair ) , but can not be accurately predicted by monte carlo calculations . in these cases the background prediction in the signal region can be obtained by a fit of the observed distribution to a smoothly decreasing function  with numerous checks in control and validation regions to see that the functional form proposed correctly describes data . for diboson resonance searches decaying into two fat jets @xmath41 the cms collaboration uses an empirical functional form  @xcite @xmath42 with @xmath43 the dijet invariant mass , @xmath44 the centre of mass energy , and @xmath45 the number of events . the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 determine the shape , while @xmath48 is a normalisation factor .",
    "factor in the numerator is used in some cases , and a generalised 5-parameter function obtained by replacing @xmath49 is required in some specific data sample . ] the atlas collaboration uses an equivalent functional form .",
    "the free parameters are fitted from data by maximising the binned likelihood function @xmath50 where @xmath51 runs over the different bins with numbers of events @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the predicted number of events ( in this case background only ) in each bin , obtained by integrating the function  ( [ ec : f3p ] ) over the appropriate range .    either",
    "when @xmath53 is predicted by monte carlo or in the above mentioned situation where it is obtained from a likelihood fit , the search for a peak on top of a smoothly falling background can be done by using a likelihood function , @xmath54 with @xmath55 the predicted number of signal events in each bin , and @xmath56 a scale factor . for simplicity",
    "we omit additional terms in the likelihood that depend on nuisance parameters corresponding to systematic uncertainties , which are also fitted when maximising the likelihood .",
    "the probability density function ( p.d.f . ) of the @xmath55 used by the atlas and cms collaborations in diboson resonance searches is a single- or double - sided crystal ball function  @xcite , which is a gaussian where one or the two exponentially - decreasing tails are replaced by power - law tails to take into account the effects of radiation . when maximising the likelihood  ( [ ec : l ] ) , both @xmath56 and the free parameters in the background prediction are allowed to float .",
    "@xmath57-values are obtained by comparing the likelihood of a background - only distribution , given by eq .",
    "( [ ec : f3p ] ) , with a background plus signal one , where the parameters in the background distribution are also varied . in order to compute",
    "expected and observed upper limits on a signal , the @xmath58 method  @xcite is used , often with the asymptotic approximation of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we apply the above mentioned procedure to estimate the sensitivity to triboson and quadriboson bumps in data .",
    "first , we need a realistic assumption of a smoothly decreasing sm background .",
    "we take as example the distributions measured by cms in the latest run 2 analysis  @xcite with a luminosity of 12.9 fb@xmath59 , specifically the data for the @xmath37 selection in high purity .",
    "as neither the fitted values for @xmath48 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 nor the numbers of observed events in data are provided , a digitising tool  @xcite is used to estimate the numbers of events per bin ( of variable width ) and subsequently obtain the best - fit function , which is given by @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "this function , plotted in figure  [ fig : dist - cms ] , agrees very well with the best - fit function obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . the p.d.f . of the potential narrow resonance signals with centre @xmath63",
    "( i.e. the resonance mass probed ) has a standard deviation of @xmath64 .",
    "the distributions shown by the cms collaboration seem quite close to a gaussian shape , and the deviations from parabolae ( in logarithmic scale ) only occur at the tails where the value of the p.d.f .",
    "is two orders of magnitude smaller than the maximum .",
    "therefore , and also because the additional parameters entering the crystal ball functions are not provided , in our analysis we take for simplicity gaussian distributions of centre @xmath63 and standard deviation @xmath64 . the probe function for @xmath65 tev is also shown in figure  [ fig : dist - cms ] .",
    "in order to address the significance of the potential excesses , we inject signals corresponding to the three distributions in figures  [ fig : dist - trib ] and  [ fig : dist - quad ] over the assumed background in figure  [ fig : dist - cms ] . we perform a pseudo - experiment and compute the local @xmath66-value for different resonance masses , in intervals of 100 gev , as well as the expected and observed 95% upper limit on signal cross sections . we also calculate the @xmath66-value and upper limits for the asimov dataset for illustration , in order to find the deviations that one would generically expect , and also to show that the pseudo - experiments are not fine - tuned .      for this distribution",
    "we add a signal with a mean of 40 events .",
    "the expected number of signal events in the selected invariant mass intervals @xmath67 $ ] tev , @xmath68 $ ] tev and @xmath69 $ ] tev is given in table  [ tab : sb ] .",
    "the asimov dataset is plotted in the top left panel of figure  [ fig : bump1-data ] , together with the background . a pseudo - experiment ( i.e. a random sample )",
    "is given on the top right panel , with the background - only best fit as a solid line and the true background as a dashed line .",
    "we observe that the background - only best fit deviates from the background used as input , and absorbs part of the excess given by the injected signal .",
    "( this also happens , but to a lesser extent , in the presence of narrow resonances . )",
    "the best - fit parameters for the background - only hypothesis are given in table  [ tab : par ] for the asimov dataset .",
    "in this particular case , @xmath47 remains almost the same and the change in shape due to the injected signal is absorbed in @xmath46 , shifting up the tail of the distribution .",
    ".number of mean background and signal events in selected invariant mass intervals .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper we have addressed the visibility of new physics signals that give a wide excess over a smoothly falling background that can not be accurately predicted .",
    "we have taken as example the signals that triboson and quadriboson resonances would give in dibsoson searches in hadronic final states .",
    "but , clearly , the scope and applications of our study are much broader .",
    "we have selected three shapes for signal distributions as benchmarks for our study : a symmetric bump and an asymmetric bump , both resulting from triboson resonances , and a quadriboson tail .",
    "our results can be summarised as follows .    1 .",
    "the symmetric bump is similar to a wide resonance of gaussian shape , but less visible , if we compare signals of the same size . for the symmetric bump both the @xmath66-value and the 95% upper limit on signal cross section",
    "are seen to deviate less from the background - only expectation .",
    "the asymmetric bump is even less visible due to its low - mass tail .",
    "the quadriboson tail is practically invisible in these searches , even for relatively large numbers of signal events .",
    "as it is obvious , the presence of a wide bump on a smootly falling background changes the `` background - only best fit '' with respect to the `` true '' background .",
    "therefore , mild deficits in data are expected at both sides of the bump .",
    "these deficits are not detected by the local @xmath66-value , which by construction gives low values only for positive deviations in data . in case that the data also underfluctuates at the sides of the bump the dips",
    "may be significant , and can be seen in any case by comparing the expected and observed limits .",
    "4 .   the shift in the background - only best fit mentioned above can also give rise to a @xmath70 excess in the leftmost bins , as it happens in the studied examples .",
    "this is also easy to understand , since the convexity of the best - fit curve may decrease by the bump .",
    "one may also wonder whether , independently of the statistical estimators of the data compatibility with the background - only hypothesis , one could detect by eye the presence of wide bumps . in order to do so , sufficient statistics are required . in the pseudo - experiments shown",
    "it is hard , not to say impossible , to determine only by eye if the pseudo - data exhibit a bump or , on the contrary , we merely have a few upper statistical fluctuations at the @xmath71 level in adjacent bins .",
    "in our study we have taken as background a function that approximately reproduces the high - purity @xmath37 sample in the cms diboson search with 12.9 fb@xmath59 , and we have seen that triboson signals of 50 events ( after branching ratios and efficiency factors ) would remain unseen .",
    "quadriboson signals of a much larger size would be invisible as well .",
    "one can then expect that , in order to explore the 2 tev region in detail , one would need five times more statistics .",
    "our results highlight a weakness of searches in which the background can not be accurately predicted by monte carlo calculations .",
    "even if some of the searches are performed for wide resonances too , signals like the triboson bumps and quadriboson tails can not be accomodated by resonances with a gaussian shape . therefore",
    ", the sensitivity to these new physics processes is small .",
    "we note that the signal distributions in this paper have been obtained by a realistic simulation  @xcite , and correspond to the generic profiles that one sees for these new physics signals .",
    "reversing our arguments , the low sensitivity to this type of signals implies that they could exist in current lhc data , and yet be mistaken by small statistical fluctuations of a few adjacent bins , yielding a local @xmath66-value at the @xmath72 level , not statistically significant .",
    "let us stress again that new heavy resonances at the reach of the lhc can undergo cascade decays and give multiboson signals while diboson signals are absent , as pointed out in ref .",
    "diboson resonance searches in the semileptonic decay modes have low sensitivities , because of the presence of the extra particles  @xcite .",
    "moreover , as shown in this work , in the absence of a significant signal shaping the hadronic decay modes have little sensitivity too .",
    "the low sensitivity of current analyses , with the absence of any convincing hint of a more `` conventional '' form of new physics beyond the sm , should motivate dedicated searches for triboson and quadriboson resonances in the lhc experiments .",
