    "the origins of power - law distributions as well as their conceptual implications have been an active topic of research in recent years .",
    "power laws are intrinsically related to the emergence of macroscopic features which are scale invariant within some bounds and distinct from the microscopic elementary degrees of freedom . often , these features are insensitive to the details of the microscopic structures .",
    "well known examples of power law distributions include the energy distribution between scales in turbulence @xcite , the distribution of earthquake magnitudes@xcite , the diameter distribution of craters and asteroids@xcite , the distribution of city populations @xcite , the distributions of income and of wealth @xcite , the size - distribution of business firms @xcite and the distribution of the frequency of appearance of words in texts@xcite .",
    "the fact that multiplicative dynamics tends to generate power - law distributions was intuitively invoked long ago @xcite but the limitations in computer simulation power kept the models under the constraints imposed by the applicability of analytical treatment .",
    "more recently , a broader class of models has been studied combining computer simulations with theoretical analysis within the microscopic representation paradigm proposed in ref .",
    "in particular , it was shown @xcite that power laws appear in a variety of dynamical processes and are maintained even under highly non - stationary conditions .    in this paper",
    "we consider a generic model of stochastic dynamics with many degrees of freedom @xmath19 , @xmath1 .",
    "the time evolution of the @xmath0 s is described by an asynchronous update mechanism in which at each time step one variable is chosen randomly and is multiplied by a factor @xmath9 taken from a predefined distribution .",
    "in addition , there is a global coupling constraint which does not allow the @xmath0 s to fall below the lower cutoff given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the momentary average of the @xmath0 s and @xmath5 is a constant .",
    "the dynamic variables @xmath0 are found to exhibit a power - law distribution of the form @xmath6 .",
    "the exponent @xmath18 is found to be insensitive to the distribution @xmath8 of the random factor @xmath9 .",
    "however , @xmath18 is non - universal , and increases monotonically as a function of @xmath10 . in the limit @xmath20 ( where the @xmath0 s become decoupled )",
    "@xmath21 for any _ finite _ @xmath14 .",
    "however , in the `` thermodynamic '' limit @xmath22 , @xmath23 for any _ positive _ @xmath10 . thus the two limits do not commute .",
    "this is important for applications since typically in empirical systems @xmath23 @xcite unlike the case of the free multiplicative random walk which predicts a log - normal distribution @xcite corresponding to @xmath21 @xcite .    the time evolution of @xmath24 exhibits intermittent fluctuations parametrized by a truncated lvy - stable distribution with the same index @xmath18 .",
    "this intricate relation between the distribution of the @xmath0 s at a given time and the temporal fluctuations of their average is examined and its relevance to empirical systems is discussed .",
    "our model indicates that in certain cases the scaling exponent may be insensitive to the distribution of the multiplicative ( random ) factor @xmath9 and depends only on the `` lower bound '' features which control the smallest values of the elementary variables .",
    "the relation between the limiting conditions and the power law exponent is to be applied in each particular case and it constitutes a strong instrument in identifying and validating the relevant degrees of freedom responsible for the emergence of scaling .    the present paper proposes to consolidate by numerical simulations the control one has on a specific model and help in this way its further application to additional systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the model .",
    "simulations and results are reported in sec .",

    "iv and a summary in sec . v.",
    "the model@xcite describes the evolution in discrete time of @xmath14 dynamic variables @xmath25 , @xmath1 . at each time step @xmath26 , an integer @xmath27",
    "is chosen randomly in the range @xmath28 , which is the index of the dynamic variable @xmath0 to be updated at that time step . a random multiplicative factor @xmath29",
    "is then drawn from a given distribution @xmath8 , which is independent of @xmath27 and @xmath26 and satisfies @xmath30 .",
    "this can be , for example , a uniform distribution in the range @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are predefined limits .",
    "the system is then updated according to the following stochastic time evolution equation @xmath34 this is an asynchronous update mechanism . the average value of the system components at time t is given by    @xmath35    the term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mult ] ) describes the effect of auto - catalysis at the individual level .",
    "in addition to the update rule of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mult ] ) , the value of the updated variable @xmath36 is constrained to be larger or equal to some lower bound which is proportional to the momentary average value of the @xmath0 s according to @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a constant factor .",
    "this constraint is imposed immediately after step ( [ eq : mult ] ) by setting @xmath39 where @xmath24 , evaluated just before the application of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mult ] ) , is used .",
    "this constraint describes the effect of auto - catalysis at the community level .",
    "our model is characterized by a fixed ( conserved ) number of dynamic variables @xmath14 , while the sum of their values is not conserved .",
    "the conservation of the number of dynamic variables , which is enforced through the lower cutoff constraint is essential since otherwise the system dwindles over time .",
    "the non - conservation of the sum of the values of the dynamic variables is important as well .",
    "it allows to perform the multiplicative updating on a single variable at a time with no explicit binary interactions since a gain in @xmath0 does not require a corresponding immediate loss by other @xmath40 s .",
    "in fact , the interactions between the dynamic variables are implied only in the step of eq .",
