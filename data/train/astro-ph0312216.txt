    "according to the popular cosmological models dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) , the formation of large galaxies occurs in a hierarchical fashion , through the coalescence of smaller systems ( blumenthal et al . 1984 ; navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ; klypin , nolthenius , & primack 1997 ) . during mergers ,",
    "the dissipationless dark matter components combine to form the extended dark halos of larger galaxies .",
    "the gas of the dwarf systems , however , dissipates its kinetic energy during mergers , decouples from the dark matter , and falls either into the center or onto the equatorial plane , forming the bulge and disk .",
    "dwarf galaxies observed today , such as the dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) satellites of the milky way , represent surviving members of the original population of building blocks from which the milky way was formed .",
    "along with the success of this picture , however , has come the realization of new problems , both in the theory and in comparisons with observations .",
    "three problems are of particular interest here .",
    "one difficulty is the so - called `` over - cooling problem . '' in the cdm scenario , the magnitude of linear density fluctuations , @xmath3 is a decreasing function of the mass scale , @xmath4 .",
    "such a fluctuation spectrum causes low mass systems to become nonlinear and virialize at earlier epochs , and within a more dense background , than larger systems .",
    "cooling is very efficient at early epochs , due both to the generally higher densities at high red redshift as well as the rapid increase in the rate of inverse compton cooling with redshift .",
    "the early growth of smaller systems , coupled with the more efficient cooling at early epochs , leads to the expectation of rapid condensation of small , dense gas clouds within the dark - matter halos of dwarf galaxies .",
    "but , unless star formation can be suppressed , most of the gaseous ordinary matter would be converted into stars well before these galactic building blocks can be assembled into present - day large galaxies such as the milky way ( white & rees 1978 ) .",
    "a second problem is the deficit of observed satellite dwarf galaxies relative to theoretical expectations .",
    "observationally , the cdm scenario naturally leads to a `` bottom - up '' hierarchical galaxy formation picture that is qualitatively consistent with dwarf galaxies having halos with higher phase - space densities than those around larger normal galaxies .",
    "high - resolution numerical simulations show , however , that dwarf galaxies with higher internal densities retain the integrity of their cores while their loosely bound halos merge with each other during the formation of larger galaxies ( moore et al .",
    "1999 ; klypin et al .",
    "consequently , the number density of surviving satellite dwarf galaxies expected from the cdm scenario is much larger than that observed in the local group .",
    "early bursts of star formation could lead to the preservation of ordinary matter in a gaseous form , followed by its removal from the dark matter potential .",
    "such a process may account for the deficit of detectable satellite galaxies .",
    "the third problem involves the building up of large galaxies from the dwarf systems . under the action of dynamical friction from the surrounding sea of dark matter ,",
    "the dwarf galaxy building blocks lose energy and orbital angular momentum before they eventually merge into larger disk galaxies .",
    "if the gas within the dwarf systems cools and contracts within their dark matter potentials , the mergers are delayed , leading to the formation of disk systems which are much smaller and denser than observed ( e.g. , navarro & benz 1991 ; navarro & white 1994 ) .",
    "the separation of gas from the dark matter potential of dwarf galaxies is one possible mechanism for the ordinary matter to retain sufficient angular momentum to form normal - size disk galaxies ( weil , eke & efstathiou 1998 ; navarro & steinmetz 1997 ; sommer - larsen , gelato & vedel 1999 ) .",
    "resolution of the above problems may require that the conversion of gas into stars within the dwarf systems be inefficient .",
    "recent theoretical investigations suggest that the conversion of gas into stars in dwarf galaxies may be suppressed by the background uv radiation at large redshifts ( weinberg , hernquist & katz 1997 ; kepner , babul & spergel 1997 ) . integrating the full equations of radiative transfer , heating , cooling and non - equilibrium chemistry for nine species : @xmath5 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , kepner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) computed the quasi - hydrostatic equilibrium states of gas in spherically symmetric dark matter potentials roughly corresponding to those of dwarf galaxies , and found that a typical background uv radiation field can easily delay cooling and collapse of gas in halos corresponding to @xmath14 cdm perturbations with circular velocities less than @xmath15 .    those results , however , introduce an inconsistency with other observed properties of low - mass dwarf galaxies . the color - magnitude diagrams of most dsphs indicate that star formation began within them at an early epoch .",
    "indeed , ursa minor and draco , whose stellar velocity dispersions are only a few @xmath16 , and whose total masses are less than @xmath17 , are composed primarily of very old stars .    in some dsphs , such as carina and fornax , the coexistence of multiple generations of young and intermediate - age stars ( grebel 1997 ; grebel & stetson 1998 ) provides evidence of protracted and recent star formation episodes .",
    "this is again difficult to account for , because little atomic or molecular gas is found in them today ( knapp , kerr & bowers 1978 ; mould et al .",
    "1990 ; bowen et al 1997 ; carignan et al .",
    "1998 ) , though some gas has been detected around some more distant dsphs , such as sculptor . while it is natural to expect that either internal star formation or external ram - pressure stripping might easily remove any residual gas from the shallow potentials of dsphs ( noriega - crespo et al . 1989",
    "; mori & burkert 2000 ) , it is difficult to reconcile the lack of either cool or warm gas with the presence of young stars .    a more complete picture of the early evolution of dwarf galaxies , and of their role in the formation of massive systems , therefore requires a more thorough understanding of the various physical processes , both external and internal , that act to trigger and regulate star formation within them . in this paper , we present an investigation of the hydrodynamic evolution and star formation history of dwarf galaxies .",
    "we construct a code which integrates a realistic star formation recipe , feedback , and radiative transfer in a 1d spherically symmetric lagrangian scheme .",
    "the code allows us to follow the evolution of both the state of the gas and the star formation of dwarf galaxies subjected to different background uv fluxes and different external perturbations . in examining the parameter space ,",
    "we seek answers to the following questions :    1 ) .",
    "is star - formation in dwarf galaxies triggered by a decrease in the background uv radiation , or by external perturbations ?    2 ) .",

    "are observed in some dsphs ?    in  2 of this paper , we describe the dwarf galaxy model , the star formation recipe , feedback , and the strmgren shell model for radiative transfer and photoionization .",
    "we combine all of these into a 1d spherically symmetric lagrangian hydrodynamical scheme . in  3 we discuss the results of our simulations , and in  4 we discuss the implications of our results .",
    "a wide range of physical processes and physical scales are associated with galaxy and star formation . including all of them",
    "would be a formidable task , beyond the capabilities of even the most powerful current generation of computers . in this work , we simplify the problem by examining the time evolution of a spherically symmetric cloud , and combine models for the most important processes , including radiative transfer , photoionization , star formation , and feedback .",
    "the problem therefore becomes tractable , and the results which we obtain may be included in larger - scale simulations .",
    "we simulate the evolution of the gas within a fixed halo potential .",
    "similar to the approach adopted by kepner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , we choose a form for the potential found by burkert ( 1995 ) , which has been shown to be a good fit to many dwarf systems .",
    "the corresponding dark matter density distribution is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the central density .",
    "the dark matter density tends to @xmath20 for @xmath21 , and @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "the rotational velocity , and mass at @xmath24 are given by @xmath25 @xmath26 in the numerical simulations presented below , the above mass distribution is arbitrarily assumed to extend out to a halo radius @xmath27 and so the total mass of the dark matter halo is @xmath28 .",
    "the dark matter halo contains ordinary matter in the forms of stars and gas .",
    "the evolution of the gas density , @xmath29 is described by the continuity equation , @xmath30 the sink term @xmath31 , due to star formation , denotes the rate by which the gas becomes gravitationally unstable ( see equation  [ eq : rhos ] ) . in the above expression",
    ", @xmath32 is the material derivative and @xmath33 is the gas velocity .",
    "the momentum equation for the gas is @xmath34 where the force @xmath35 is due to the gradient of the gravitational potential @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the gas pressure , and we introduce a kinetic pressure , @xmath38 to represent the momentum input due to stellar wind and supernovae of massive stars ( see equation  [ eq : pk ] ) .",
    "massive stars emit intense uv radiation , providing another mechanism for feedback .",
    "in addition , observations of ly@xmath39 clouds along quasar lines - of - sight suggest that , at high redshifts , the universe is permeated by a metagalactic uv flux . at @xmath40 ,",
    "this background is estimated to have a strength @xmath41 at the lyman limit ( bechtold et al 1987 ) .",
    "both of these energy sources are modelled in the energy equation of the gas , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the specific internal energy , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 represent radiative heating and cooling terms .",
    "in order to consider the effect of feedback , the formation rate of massive stars must be specified . here",
    ", we introduce a simple prescription for massive star formation . in general ,",
    "gas is destabilized by its collective self - gravity and stablized by internal pressure and external tidal stress .",
    "when the residual gas within a galaxy is fully ionized , it attains hydrostatic equilibrium , with the jeans mass @xmath47 of the system comparable to or larger than the total mass of gas .",
    "but , if the gas is able to cool well below the ionization temperature , @xmath47 decreases to masses comparable to high mass stars .",
    "the density of the residual gas also increases as it contracts to a new hydrostatic equilibrium within the dark matter potential . in those regions of the dwarf galaxy where @xmath48 , with @xmath49 the tidal field of the potential is insufficient to prevent the collapse of gas within the jeans radius @xmath50 . in the absence of a strong magnetic field ,",
    "the gas collapses to form stellar mass objects when these conditions are satisfied .",
    "ionizing photons and stellar winds from young , massive stars act to raise the jeans mass of surrounding gas , inhibiting further star formation .",
    "the collapse of the gas cloud does not , however , lead to immediate star formation and feedback . a minimum time delay between the instant when the gas becomes gravitationally unstable and the onset of main sequence evolution for the resulting generation of stars is the dynamical free - fall time scale @xmath51 .",
    "if the collapsing gas has angular momentum , protostellar disks would form , through which gas is accreted onto the growing protostellar objects on a viscous time scale .",
    "after the formation of the protostars , an additional time interval , @xmath52 , must elapse before the emission of intense uv radiation .",
    "for most of our models , we choose @xmath53  myr .",
    "but in some delayed star formation models , we choose @xmath54 either 5 or 50  myr , to represent delays due to disk accretion ( yorke & sonnhalter 2002 ) , merger processes ( murray & lin 1996 , bonnel _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , or sequential star formation ( elmegreen & lada 1977 ) .",
    "thus , changes in the stellar and gas mass densities ( @xmath55 and @xmath29 respectively ) are related via a time - delay , such that @xmath56 and , @xmath57 where @xmath58 refers to the local free - fall timescale at the epoch when the collapse begins , i.e. @xmath59 .",
    "we adopt a form for the star formation efficiency , @xmath60 , of @xmath61 \\left[1+\\left(\\frac{r_j}{r_r}\\right)^{\\lambda_r}\\right]}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the critical temperature for the onset of @xmath63 star formation , and @xmath64 is the roche radius of the gas in the potential of the dwarf galaxy .",
    "the three factors in @xmath60 act to decrease the star formation efficiency in situations where it is expected to be low .",
    "when the local free fall time is longer than the timescale for the onset of main sequence evolution , then it would be expected that , because of the spread in star formation times , the first stars to form would inhibit further star formation .",
    "the efficiency is reduced for high stellar masses , due to the fact that the dynamical timescale for the evolution of the gas exceeds the evolution time of massive stars , in which case the first stars to form would re - ionize the surrounding gas before it , too , could collapse to form stars .",
    "finally , star formation is also expected to be inefficient whenever the roche radius of a jeans unstable region exceeds its tidal radius within the dwarf galaxy .",
    "we set the star formation quenching factors @xmath65 , such that star formation is rapidly shut off whenever one or more of the above criteria is met .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we set the maximum efficiency @xmath66 . in some cases ,",
    "we choose @xmath67 , representing a conversion of at most ten percent of the total residual gas into stars within a free fall time .    accompanying each massive progenitor star",
    ", there are many coeval lower - mass stars .",
    "thus , the corresponding formation rate , per unit volume , of massive uv and wind producing stars is given by @xmath68 the total mass of stars formed per uv , wind , and supernova producing star , @xmath69 , can be estimated from a scalo initial mass function ( imf ) to be 150 @xmath70 ( scalo 1986 ; miller & scalo 1979 ) . for more general initial mass functions , we set @xmath71 where @xmath72 for a steeper initial mass function with a relatively small cut off in the stellar mass function at the high end .",
    "unless otherwise stated , @xmath73 is chosen for most of our models . in order to explore the effects of variations , we examine some models in which @xmath74 .",
    "the formation of massive stars strongly influences the environment .",
    "the massive stars emit uv radiation with a well - determined flux ( see e.g. osterbrock 1989 ) . when averaged over a miller - scalo initial mass function , the rate of ionizing photon emission per 10  @xmath70 star is @xmath75 s@xmath1 .",
    "photoionization by uv radiation from massive stars can be included in the energy equation of the gas , and in determining its ionization state ( see below ) .",
    "stars are assumed to emit uv photons at an average rate of @xmath76 for a time equal to the average lifetime of a massive star , @xmath77  myr .",
    "after that time , they are taken to be `` dead stars , '' contributing to the overall mass of the system , but providing no feedback to the gas .",
    "after a brief stage of adiabatic expansion away from the massive stars , the main effect of the stellar winds and supernovae is to increase the momentum of the surrounding gas .",
    "we approximate this feedback process as a a `` kinetic pressure '' term in equation  ( [ eq : momentum ] ) , defined for each given volume ( zone ) of the model as @xmath78 where the surface area at the center of the zone is @xmath79 . the first term in equation  [ eq : pk ] is the momentum flux due to supernovae , and the second is that due to stellar winds . in the above equation , @xmath80 is the momentum of a single supernova explosion ( we adopt @xmath81 g cm s@xmath1 ) , @xmath82 is the total supernova rate ( number of sn per unit time ) within the volume of the zone .",
    "the value of @xmath82 is obtained from the the supernova rate per unit volume , which itself is determined by the star formation rate at the earlier time @xmath83 , i.e. @xmath84 the total number of massive stars on the main sequence within the volume of the zone is @xmath85 , while the wind mass loss rate of a typical massive star and the typical wind speed are @xmath86 y@xmath1 ) and @xmath87 km s@xmath1 ) , respectively .    with these prescriptions for the feedback process",
    ", we use a one - dimensional lagrangian hydrodynamic model for the evolution of the baryonic gas component within the fixed external gravitational potential set by the dark matter ( richtmyer & morton 1995 ) .",
    "as indicated above , uv radiation from both massive stars and the background can lead to photoionization and heating of the residual gas .",
    "a comprehensive treatment of the full 3d radiative transfer requires the determination of the contribution to the flux at every point from every other point along all paths for each wavelength , which is at the minimum a 6d problem .",
    "however , in most instances , symmetries can be introduced , resulting in a more tractable situation .",
    "the greatest simplification occurs when the gas can be assumed to be optically thin throughout .",
    "this approximation is sufficient in the majority of cosmological situations ( katz , weinberg & hernquist 1996 ; navarro & steinmetz 1996 ; anninos , norman & clarke 1994 ) and only breaks down in the cores of halos that have undergone sufficient cooling , a situation that is usually made intractable by the complexities of star formation .",
    "the next simplest geometry is that of a slab ( or a sphere under the assumption of a radially perpendicular radiation field ) , which reduces the flow to an intrinsically 2d problem . this approach is the most common in radiative transfer , and has been used to address similar situations to those considered here ( hainman , rees & loeb 1996 ; haiman , thoul , & loeb 1996 ) .    in this paper , we adopt a similar approach for spherical geometry .",
    "we relax the assumption of a radially perpendicular radiation field by treating radiative transfer using the strmgren shell model .",
    "similar to the original strmgrem model , the ionized `` h ii '' shell is assumed to be surrounded isotropically by a neutral @xmath88 region ( figure  [ fig : strom ] ) . the rate of entry of ionizing photons into the ionized volume balances the total number of recombinations to excited levels within the volume .    in our implementation of the strmgrem shell model , we use a discretized 1d lagrangian hydrodynamic scheme .",
    "we define @xmath89 to be the number of photons required to ionize zone @xmath90 , with @xmath91 being the volume of the zone , @xmath92 being the number density of hydrogen , and @xmath93 being the case b recombination coefficient ( osterbrock 1989 ) . the total number of uv photons emitted by the massive stars in the zone is @xmath94 , while @xmath95 is the rate of uv photons entering into the zone from larger radii , and @xmath96 is the rate of uv photons entering into the zone from smaller radii ( figure  [ fig : geom ] ) . in the innermost zone",
    ", there is only @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the total rate of ionizing photons either produced within or entering into the zone is @xmath99 .",
    "if @xmath100 , then the zone is only partially ionized , and the ionization fraction of the gas is given by @xmath101 if @xmath102 then @xmath103 , and any photons in excess of @xmath104 give rise to @xmath105 and @xmath106 of adjacent zones , as follows ; @xmath107 and @xmath108 the term @xmath109 with @xmath110 and @xmath111 being , respectively , the inner and outer radii of any zone , is a factor that takes into consideration the spherical geometry of the model . in the limit of isotropic radiation , that geometry causes slightly more than half of the photons within a zone to exit in the outward direction . the case of either slab geometry or of a radially - directed radiation field can be represented by @xmath112 .",
    "the above form of @xmath113 can be arrived at by considering the optically thin limit with only inflowing uv photons . in that case , the uv intensity @xmath114 , and the flux of photons @xmath115 , thus @xmath116 .",
    "care is also taken to deal with the special cases when either @xmath106 or @xmath105 is negative .",
    "iterations by sweeping inwards and then outwards several times are taken to ensure convergence .",
    "for the innermost zone , @xmath117 , while for the outermost zone @xmath98 is given by the external radiation field .    the external uv flux @xmath118  ergs  s@xmath1  @xmath119  ster@xmath1  hz@xmath1 at the lyman limit at low red shift , and @xmath120 times more intense at redshift @xmath121 ( cf .",
    "haardt & madau 1996 ) , is sufficient to ionize most dwarf spheroidal galaxies throughout . for a less intense external flux ,",
    "neutral residual gas is surrounded by ionized gas .",
    "the presence of metals would increase the critical @xmath122 needed for fully ionizing the dwarf galaxy , but , because we are considering the early evolution of low - metallicity systems , the modification is expected to be limited . the temperature of the photoionized gas is taken to be 15,000  k , appropriate for low - metallicities .",
    "we calculate the temperature for the @xmath88 region according to equation  [ eq : energy ] .",
    "we adopt equilibrium cooling rates , including contributions from hydrogen , helium , and metals ( dalgarno & mccray 1972 ; fall & rees 1985 ) . because the dwarf galaxies being modeled have low metallicities , and we are modeling them at early epochs , the metallicity is taken to be low , [ fe / h]=-2 . in the absence of photoionization , such metal - poor gas gas may cool to a minimum temperature of @xmath123  k ( kang et al . 1990 ; lin & murray 1992 ) . using the above treatments for heating , cooling , and radiative transfer",
    ", we can compute the ionization fraction and the temperature of the gas as well as the attenuation of the ionizing photons .",
    "we note that the model described above follows the assumptions used in calculating static , `` initial '' strmgren spheres .",
    "these are formed extremely rapidly , on timescales of the order of the recombination time of the gas ( @xmath124  s ) .",
    "subsequently , the gas expands in response to the photoionization heating . to compute , on galactic scales , the evolution of individual strmgren spheres , as well as that of the ionization front propagating inwards from the external uv radiation , is a multidimensional problem , beyond current computational capabilities .",
    "our models do capture the expansion of the ionized gas within each zone in response to heating , and therefore account for its global effects upon feedback and star formation .",
    "the essential physics of the problem is therefore included in the models .",
    "our models also assume the gas to be uniformly distributed within each zone .",
    "clumpiness in the ism would increase the value of @xmath104 from that given above .",
    "clumpiness would result from either temperature variations ( a multi - phase medium ) or self - gravity .",
    "in the former case , the presence of a cold medium implies the lack of sufficient uv photons to completely ionize the galaxy , and that subsequent star formation shall rapidly lead to re - heating and ionization of the gas , ie . in our models",
    ", this corresponds to a dwarf galaxy undergoing star formation .",
    "if the gas is completely heated , the jeans mass is sufficiently large that self - gravity shall be unable to cause significant clumping .",
    "finally , our models do not include metallicity evolution of the gas , due to star formation .",
    "metallicity does not strongly affect the size of strmgren spheres , and so this shall not significantly affect our assumptions regarding ionization by external and internal uv sources .",
    "the primary affect of increasing metallicity is to enhance cooling in gas that has lost its heat source , potentially enhancing the star formation efficiency .",
    "this , too , is not likely to be a strong effect , because the timescales for star formation are dominated by the initial free - fall time of the gas , and the pre - main sequence evolution time of the stars .",
    "the main affect would , therefore , likely be in the stellar mass function .",
    "higher metallicity gas can cool to lower temperatures , possibly enhancing the formation of low mass stars , and reducing the effectiveness of internal feedback .",
    "such effects must be included in the uncertainties of our models , and we explore a wide range of parameters in order to examine their potential significance .",
    "the currently preferred ( e.g. de bernardis et al 2002 ) cosmological parameters are as follows : the hubble constant is @xmath125 the age of the universe is @xmath126  gyr ; the baryonic density parameter is @xmath127 ; and the dark matter density parameter is @xmath128 .",
    "these parameters are relevant to the issues of delayed star formation in dwarf galaxies .",
    "for instance , kepner et al . (",
    "1997 ) simulated halos in the range of @xmath129 , which , using their model , translate to : @xmath130 . in their models , @xmath131 , such that the baryonic fraction is : @xmath132 with the very small value of @xmath133 , dwarf galaxies at the low end of the mass range could not form stars even today because the recombination efficiency is insufficient to offset photoionization due to external background uv radiation .",
    "kepner et al . (",
    "1997 ) deduced such a small value for @xmath134 under the assumption that the ordinary matter is accreted onto the dark matter halo from an ionized intergalactic medium with temperature @xmath135  k. however , if the dwarf galaxies formed prior to the era of reionization or if the first generation stars are primarily formed in the progenitors of dwarf galaxies , then cool , neutral gas may be retained by their dark matter haloes with the cosmological value of @xmath136 .",
    "observation of dwarf galaxies in the local group find high baryonic fractions ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "indeed , in some systems , such as ngc  147 , the observationally inferred estimate of @xmath134 approaches unity .",
    "such values indicate that these systems may have undergone complicated and highly varied evolutionary histories .",
    "it is possible that dwarf galaxies had larger values of @xmath134 in the past , and have since preferentially lost a fraction of their baryonic matter through star formation feedback ( dekel & silk 1986 ) and tidal stripping ( murray , dong , & lin 2003 ) .",
    "it is also possible that the observed dwarf galaxies are completely different from the dwarf galaxy building blocks in the cdm scenario . in view of these uncertainties , it is useful to consider a wider range of parameters than adopted by kepner et al .",
    "we find below that the magnitude of @xmath134 is a crucial factor in regulating the star formation efficiency in dwarf galaxies .    in the analysis of kepner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , gas is assumed to be in quasi - hydrostatic equilibrium at all times . yet , both pre - star formation evolution and post - star formation feedback processes lead to flow and evolution of the residual gas mass that should be treated with a time - dependent dynamical calculation . in addition ,",
    "external perturbations , such as tidal disturbances by nearby large galaxies or collisions with other gas - rich dwarf galaxies are also important in modifying the density and velocity of the gas .",
    "for some models , we approximate the possibility of a strong tidal compression ( or a mild collision ) with an initial velocity perturbation in the form of a hubble inflow @xmath137 when scaled with the halo radius and the characteristic velocity dispersion , the above expression is equivalent to @xmath138 .",
    "the main purpose of our calculation is to study the conditions under which old stars formed within dwarf galaxies .",

    "the relatively short dynamical time scales within the dwarf galaxies suggests that such a precise timing may be difficult to achieve .",

    "the gas can then cool , contract , and trigger additional bursts of star formation , as is observed in some of our models .",
    "in all systems which undergo either one or multiple episodes of star formation , the feedback is eventually sufficiently strong as to drive the gas out of the system .",
    "episodic star formation may also result from reducing the efficiency of feedback , either by reducing the conversion efficiency of gas into stars , or the fraction of massive stars which form .",

    "within the environment of a galaxy cluster , or near to a massive galaxy , a dwarf system shall experience tidal forces , that shall vary over time , resulting in occasional , or even periodic compressions .",
    "if dwarf systems form in large numbers around more massive overdense regions , they shall also experience collisions .",
    "the merger process which builds larger galactic entities can also lead to collisions and disturbances .",
    "both mechanisms lead to enhancements in the density , and therefore the recombination efficiency of the gas within dwarf galaxies . in small systems at early epochs",

    "the star formation rates are enhanced by as much as an order of magnitude relative to unperturbed systems for realistic compression speeds .",
    "perturbations such as considered here would be expected to be stronger in dense cluster environments , or near to massive galaxies . in the former , collisions would be more frequent , while in the latter , tidal variations due to elliptical orbits around the parent system are strongest .",
    "these are also environments where tidal stripping , ram pressure , and external uv radiation are all enhanced , which would be expected to act to reduce star formation efficiencies , and so it is unclear whether the effect of perturbations alone would lead to environmental dependences for stellar populations within dwarf galaxies .      as indicated in earlier work , star formation in the lowest mass dwarf galaxies",
    "is difficult at early epochs , and the observed population of dsphs appear to be at the very edge of the ability of small galaxies to form stars .",
    "the difficulty is due to the strong uv background , which easily ionizes the galaxies throughout , preventing the gas from cooling and contracting within the weak gravitational potential of the dwarf system .",
    "star formation may still occur , even in the smallest systems , however , if the gas within them can become self - shielded from the external uv .",
    "such might be the case if they form with a relatively large baryonic fraction , if they accrete additional gas , or if they undergo compressions due to either tidal forces or collisions . such processes may help to explain the existence of old stellar populations in even the smallest dsphs .",
    "feedback from star formation also forms a natural means for avoiding the `` over - cooling '' problem among the dwarf progenitors of massive galaxies .    in small systems , star formation tends to occur in bursts , the feedback from which either expels the gas completely from the galaxy , or drives it to large radii , making it vulnerable to either tidal or ram - pressure stripping .",

    "the gas within the system does , however , expand under the influence of stellar feedback , and so may also be subject to stripping within galactic cluster environments ( murray , dong , & lin 2003 ) .",
    "the possibility of severe mass loss from dwarf galaxies following star formation indicates that the currently observed baryonic - to - dark matter ratios can provide only lower limits , possibly very weak limits , to the values present when the galaxies formed .",
    "our models indicate that the star formation efficiencies , and the ability of galaxies to retain gas following star formation depend very sensitively dependences upon the evolutionary histories of the galaxies , and upon the galactic potentials , which may account for the large dispersion in the stellar to dark - matter fraction observed today among the dwarf galaxies .",

    "<S> we examine the star formation history and stellar feedback effects of dwarf galaxies under the influence of extragalactic ultraviolet radiation . </S>",
    "<S> previous work has indicated that the background uv flux can easily ionize the gas within typical dwarf galaxies , delaying or even preventing cooling and star formation within them . </S>",
    "<S> many dwarf galaxies within the local group are , however , observed to contain multiple generations of stars , the oldest of which formed in the early epochs of cosmic evolution , when the background uv flux was intense . in order to address this paradox </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the dynamical evolution of gas in dwarf galaxies using a one - dimensional , spherically symmetric , lagrangian numerical scheme to compute the effects of radiative transfer and photoionization . </S>",
    "<S> we include a physically - motivated star formation recipe and consider the effects of feedback . </S>",
    "<S> this scheme allows us to follow the history of the gas and of star formation within dwarf galaxies , as influenced by both external and internal uv radiation . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that star formation in the severe environment of dwarf galaxies is a difficult and inefficient process . in potentials with total mass less than a few @xmath0 , and velocity dispersion less than a few km s@xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , residual gas is efficiently photoionized by cosmic background uv radiation . </S>",
    "<S> since the density scale height of the gas within these galaxies is comparable to their size , gas may be tidally removed from them , leaving behind starless residual dark matter clumps . for intermediate mass systems , such as the dsphs around the galaxy , </S>",
    "<S> star formation can proceed with in early cosmic epochs despite the intense background uv flux . </S>",
    "<S> triggering processes such as merger events , collisions , and tidal disturbance can lead to density enhancements , reducing the recombination timescale , allowing gas to cool and star formation to proceed . </S>",
    "<S> however , the star formation and gas retention efficiency may vary widely in galaxies with similar dark matter potentials , because they depend on many factors , such as the baryonic fraction , external perturbation , imf , and background uv intensity . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the presence of very old stars in these dwarf galaxies indicates that their initial baryonic to dark matter content was comparable to the cosmic value . </S>",
    "<S> this constraint suggests that the initial density fluctuation of baryonic matter may be correlated with that of the dark matter . for the more massive dwarf elliptical galaxies , </S>",
    "<S> the star formation efficiency and gas retention rate is much higher . </S>",
    "<S> their mass to light ratio is regulated by star formation feedback , and is expected to be nearly independent of their absolute luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the results of our theoretical models reproduce the observed @xmath2 correlation . </S>"
