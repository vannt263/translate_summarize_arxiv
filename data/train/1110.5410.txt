    "transition metal oxides ( tmos ) have attracted significant interest due to various fascinating phenomena such as high-@xmath3 superconductivity and colossal magnetoresistance , which originate from the interplay between spin , charge , orbital , and lattice degrees of freedom.@xcite recently , the interfaces of tmo heterostructures have exhibited unique physical properties that are different from their constituent materials.@xcite to further explore multifunctional properties that utilize the electronic degrees of freedom , it is crucial to grow oxide thin films in an atom - by - atom manner by monitoring the initial stage of epitaxial behavior at the atomic level.@xcite    the initial growth of tmo thin films has been typically characterized using diffraction methods , such as _ in situ _ reflection high - energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) measurements .",
    "scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) provides information regarding real - space surface structures with high spatial resolution , as demonstrated in cuprate,@xcite manganite,@xcite and titanate@xcite thin films . due to poor preparation processes of the substrate surfaces under actual oxide growth conditions .    in this article , we demonstrate atomic - scale visualization of the initial homoepitaxial srtio@xmath0 growth process using stm .",
    "an annealing method was first developed to prepare a ( @xmath1)-@xmath433.7@xmath5 ( hereafter described as ( @xmath1 ) for brevity ) reconstructed srtio@xmath0(001 ) surface under typical conditions for oxide thin film growth .",
    "a few monolayer ( ml ) srtio@xmath0 thin films were subsequently deposited on the ( @xmath1 ) reconstructed surface .",
    "are clearly identified on the first- and second - layer surfaces of the film , which indicates atomic - scale coherent epitaxy between the thin film and substrate .",
    "our study shifts the oxide thin film growth and nanostructure research , from unit - cell level to atomic level .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows a widely accepted annealing procedure used to obtain wide terraces with equidistant steps of unit - cell height ( step / terrace structure).@xcite the bhf - etched substrate with step / terrace structure was annealed under an oxygen partial pressure ( @xmath6 ) of @xmath7 torr at 1000@xmath5c for 30 min .",
    "a streaky rheed pattern was confirmed and a clear step / terrace structure was observed .",
    "however , on a smaller scale , no ordered structure was found in the stm images [ fig .",
    "1(c)].@xcite    the annealing sequence was optimized to improve the atomic surface structure [ fig .",
    "the samples were degassed at 500@xmath5c for 2 h at @xmath8 torr , and then annealed at 850@xmath5c for 40 min under @xmath9 torr to obtain large ( @xmath1 ) domains . during this annealing ,",
    "the samples were heated to 1000@xmath5c for 3 min to straighten the step structures .",
    "after annealing , a very sharp rheed pattern was observed that corresponded to the ( @xmath1 ) reconstruction [ fig .",
    "1(e)].@xcite in this model , the surface structure is composed of an additional ti - rich ( @xmath1 ) layer formed on a bulk - like termination of a tio@xmath10 plane.@xcite it should be stressed here that stm images also showed the ( @xmath1 ) periodicity together with a clear step / terrace structure preferable for thin film deposition [ fig .",
    "1(f ) ] . to date , a large number of srtio@xmath0 surface structures have been reported,@xcite whereas little attention has been paid to the stability of those surface structures under the film growth conditions , in particular , in an oxygen partial pressure at high temperatures . considering our results and the previous report on the preparation of ( @xmath1 ) reconstructed surface in an external oxygen - flowing tube furnace,@xcite we anticipate this reconstructed surface to be stable in a wide range of @xmath6 , from uhv to 1 atm .",
    "further , the surface was found to be robust at various temperatures , from room temperature to 850@xmath5c , because the rheed patterns were unchanged during cooling down to room temperature at a rate of 3 - 5@xmath5c / s , representing no phase transition of the surface structure . in terms of",
    "the understanding of the surface stability as well as the atomic arrangement of the structure , the ( @xmath1 ) reconstructed surface is an appropriate substrate to fabricate oxide thin films and heterointerfaces .    in order to fabricate higher - grade heterostructures ,",
    "it is also particularly important to grow well - defined epitaxial films on atomically ordered substrates .",
    "we next optimized the laser fluence for srtio@xmath0 homoepitaxial growth on the ( @xmath1 ) srtio@xmath0 substrates .",
    "figure 2(a ) shows out - of - plane x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) results acquired around ( 004 ) peak of the 100-nm thick srtio@xmath0 films . except for the film deposited at 0.42 j/@xmath11",
    ", the xrd peaks of ( 004 ) appear at lower 2@xmath12 values than the substrate peak 2@xmath13 , indicating lattice expansion along the @xmath14 axis , which can be interpreted as the deposition of nonstoichimetric films.@xcite using this optimal value , 0.42 j/@xmath11 , a clear rheed intensity oscillation was observed in a layer - by - layer manner and persisted until stopping deposition ( fig .",
    "therefore , this deposition condition assures the well - controlled epitaxial growth of nearly stoichiometic srtio@xmath0 .",
    "the application of the atomically defined substrate to the conventional oxide epitaxial growth allows for atomic - scale visualization of the initial growth process near the interface between the srtio@xmath0 layer and the substrate .",
    "some of possible growth processes for srtio@xmath0 deposition on the well - defined ( @xmath1 ) surface are illustrated in fig .",
    "3 . for example , to determine which growth process in fig . 3 occurs , we show , in fig .",
    "4 , stm images of 0.3 ml and 1.6 ml srtio@xmath0 films grown on a ( @xmath1 ) reconstructed surface .",
    "the exact thickness was evaluated from island - coverage in wide - scale stm images ( fig .",
    "4(a),(b ) inset ) . a ( @xmath1)-based mesh structure was clearly evident , not only on the substrate , but also on the first layer of srtio@xmath0 islands .",
    "growth of a 1.6 ml srtio@xmath0 film on a ( @xmath1 ) reconstructed substrate surface was also observed and the ( @xmath1 ) structure was identified on the second layer of srtio@xmath0 , as indicated in fig .",
    "these results support the third mechanism given in fig .",
    "3 , in which the atomic structure of the substrate surface is transferred to the film surface , and therefore coherent epitaxy of srtio@xmath0 can be realized at the interface between the thin film and substrate .",
    "in summary , the initial growth process of homoepitaxial srtio@xmath0 thin film was investigated at the atomic level using stm .",
    "an annealing process was first developed to obtain a ( @xmath1)-reconstructed srtio@xmath0(001 ) substrate that is stable under typical conditions for oxide thin film deposition .",
    "after the homoepitaxial growth of srtio@xmath0 on the ( @xmath1 ) reconstructed surface , ( @xmath1 ) structures were observed , even on the first and second layer of the srtio@xmath0 thin films , which demonstrates the atomic - scale coherent epitaxy between thin film and substrate .",
    "this atomically controlled substrate surface has the potential to replace the conventional `` step - and - terrace surface '' for the fabrication of higher quality thin films and heterostructures .",
    "the application of this surface to heteroepitaxy would open up atomic - scale investigations of oxide thin film growth and studies of local physical properties of multifunctional oxide materials .",
    "niobium - doped ( 0.1 atom % ) srtio@xmath0(001 ) single crystals ( shinkosha corp . ) were used as substrates to ensure conductivity for low - temperature scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) measurements .",
    "the ( @xmath1)-@xmath2 reconstructed surfaces with step and terrace structures were prepared by buffered hydrofluoric acid ( bhf ) etching and subsequent annealing .",
    "non - doped srtio@xmath0 thin films were homoepitaxially grown on the ( @xmath1)-@xmath2 substrate surfaces using pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) .",
    "the films were grown under an oxygen partial pressure ( @xmath6 ) of @xmath7 torr at 700@xmath5c by direct current resistive heating through the samples .",
    "a krf excimer laser ( wavelength of 248 nm ) with a repetition rate of 2 hz was employed , and the laser fluence at the target surface was 0.42 j/@xmath11 .",
    "the film growth was monitored from the _ in situ _ rheed intensity oscillation in a layer - by - layer growth manner .",
    "after growth , the samples were cooled to room temperature at a rate of 3 - 5@xmath5c / s under @xmath15 torr followed by immediate transfer to the stm without exposure of the sample surface to air .",
    "all stm measurements were conducted at 78 k.",
