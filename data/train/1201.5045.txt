    "since graphene was first isolated experimentally @xcite , it is in the focus of attention of both theorists and experimentalists .",
    "obviously , our understanding of graphene starts from the knowledge of its energy bands .",
    "it is commonknowledge that the highest valence ( @xmath2 ) band and the lowest lying conduction ( @xmath3 ) band merge at the fermi level at point @xmath1 ( the corner of the brillouin zone ) .",
    "the dispersion law of these two bands ( obtained in the tight  binding approximation ) is also well known since the seminal paper by wallace @xcite .",
    "the other bands in graphene were also studied previously , although in a much less detailed way than the above mentioned two . in particular , there were performed first principle calculations of the band structure of graphene @xcite .    however , a crucial element in our understanding of the band structure of graphene is still missing , that is the symmetry analysis of the bands . such analysis ( for any periodic crystal hamiltonian ) is most easily performed with the help of elementary group theory @xcite .",
    "the symmetry of crystal is characterized by a point group @xmath4 .",
    "any operation of this group ( save the unit transformation ) takes a general wavevector @xmath5 into a distinct one .",
    "however , for some special choices of @xmath5 some of the operations of the crystal symmetry group will take @xmath5 into itself rather than into a distinct wavevector .",
    "these particular operations are called the group of @xmath5 ; it is a subgroup of the full symmetry group of the crystal .",
    "lines in the brillouin zone for which the group of the wavevector contains elements other than the unit element are called symmetry lines . at special points in the brillouin zone",
    "the group of the wavevector may be larger than that on symmetry lines which thread it ; these are called symmetry points .",
    "we may use a state ( states ) corresponding to such a special wavevector to generate a representation for the group of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "( for an arbitrary wavevector , of course , the group of the wavevector is simply @xmath6 , and the only irreducible representation which may be realized by the states corresponding to such a wavevector is the unit representation . )",
    "we may classify states at a wavevector corresponding to a symmetry point according to the irreducible representation of the group of the wavevector at that point . as the wavevector then moves away from the point ,",
    "the group of the wavevector becomes smaller and some of the degeneracies will be split.we may determine the irreducible representations into which the original representation will split .",
    "conditions relating the irreducible representations of adjoining points and lines are called compatibility relations and were discussed for the first time in ref . @xcite .",
    "the early classical papers in the field are reprinted in ref .",
    "the energy band calculations are most commonly carried out along symmetry lines in the brillouin zone .",
    "we have calculated the band - structure of graphene along the @xmath0@xmath1@xmath7@xmath0 line with the code elk @xcite which implements the full potential linearized plane wave method ( fp - lapw ) @xcite and the local - density approximation ( lda ) exchange - correlation ( xc ) potential .",
    "the k - vector grid was unshifted with 64 @xmath8 64 @xmath8 1 points with all the symmetries applied .",
    "the separation @xmath9 between the periodically repeated in the perpendicular direction graphene layers was chosen at 200 bohr . with this , the elimination of the inter - layer interaction has been ensured .",
    "the results of the calculation are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands ] .",
    "the curves marked have been found well converged with respect to the further increase of @xmath9 and they represent the intrinsic nine lowest - lying valence and conduction bands of graphene . while the overall agreement with previous pseudopotential - based band - structure calculations @xcite is found , one important point warrants a special noting : in ref .  , the two low - lying ( at @xmath0 point ) bands were attributed to image - potential states . since , in contrast to ref .",
    ", we do not impose an additional image potential , and since lda for xc potential does not account for the latter @xcite , we conclude that the two bands in question are ordinary kohn - sham lda energy bands rather than the image - state bands .    the gray background in fig .",
    "[ fig : bands ] represents the continuous spectrum which is extrapolated in the @xmath10 limit from the quasi - continuous one obtained from the calculations .",
    "the edge of the continuum is at approximately 4.6 ev at the @xmath0 point which gives the vacuum level in this calculation .",
    "the bands entering continuum ( red lines inside the gray background ) turn into resonances , i.e. , the corresponding wave - functions leak out from the graphene plane into vacuum . however , this leakage is apparently weak as indicated by the stability of the corresponding bands with respect to the @xmath9 increase .",
    "the studies of the width of the resonances , including those corresponding to the higher bands , will be submitted for publication separately .",
    "( color online ) graphene band - structure evaluated with use of the fp - lapw method .",
    "the red - marked lines are well - converged single graphene layer bands , while gray background corresponds to continuous spectrum .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the symmetry points in graphene are point @xmath0 , the center of the brillouin zone , points @xmath1 , which are corners of the brillouin zone , and points @xmath7 , which are the centers of the edges of the brillouin zone .",
    "the symmetry lines are @xmath0-@xmath1 , @xmath0-@xmath7 and @xmath1-@xmath7 lines .",
    "the small group of vector @xmath5 at point @xmath0 is @xmath11 .",
    "the small group of vector @xmath5 at point @xmath1 is @xmath12 .",
    "the small group of vector @xmath5 at lines @xmath0-@xmath1 is @xmath13 .",
    "the representation of the group @xmath11 we can obtain noticing that @xmath14 thus representation , say , @xmath15 of group @xmath16 begets two representations of the group @xmath11 : @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where the letter @xmath19 or @xmath20 means that the representation is even or odd with respect to inversion respectively . the @xmath21-axis is always chosen perpendicular to the graphene plane . when considering the @xmath0-@xmath1 line ,",

    "( [ ex ] ) we obtain @xmath23 it should be noted that the result does not depend on @xmath24 being in any sense small @xcite .    recalling the symmetry of the states relative to reflection in the plane of graphene ,",
    "( [ simple ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath25 for @xmath26 states , and as @xmath27 for @xmath2 states .",
    "a picture that emerges becomes clear in the extended brillouin zone scheme , where the brillouin zones fill the whole plane .",
    "each brillouin zone being a hexagon , three zones meet at their corners ; two of them merge .    to find the dispersion law in the vicinity of the merging point we may consider a reduced hamiltonian , @xmath28 where each element is a linear function of @xmath29 ( @xmath5 is the deviation of the wavevector from the merging point ) , and we have shifted the energy axis , such that the energy in the merging point is now zero .",
    "the dispersion law for the hamiltonian ( [ ham5 ] ) is given by equation @xmath30 describing two cones , which is a general situation for levels crossing @xcite .",
    "however , in the case considered , we can be more specific about these cones . because any vector in the @xmath29 plane compatible with the symmetry @xmath31 is identically equal to zero , and any tensor of rank two compatible with the symmetry is proportional to the unity tensor , the dispersion law is just @xmath32 and the cones are circular , with the axis perpendicular to the @xmath29 plane .",

    "@xcite was an important precedent in applying group theory methods to graphene .",
    "the appearance of massless dirac fermions under conditions of hexagonal symmetry was considered in ref . @xcite .",
