    "the slac and kek b factories are asymmetric e@xmath2e@xmath3 colliders which run at centre - of - mass energies at , and close to , the @xmath4 resonance . at these energies , around 10.58  gev",
    ", the cross section for tau - pair production , at 0.89  nb , is close to the 1.05  nb cross section for b@xmath5 production .",
    "these machines are therefore also tau factories , and the experiments babar and belle have between them so far recorded over @xmath6 tau - pair events . in comparison , the four lep experiments each recorded only about @xmath7 tau - pair events , mainly running on the z resonance , while cleo - iii at cesr took about @xmath8 tau - pair events .",
    "however , it should be noted that experimental conditions for tau physics at lep were particularly clean , resulting in relatively small systematic errors . for channels with large branching fractions , where systematic errors dominate",
    ", the lep results will remain competitive for some time .",
    "measuring static properties of the tau , such as mass , lifetime and electroweak couplings , allow tests of lepton universality and cpt invariance .",
    "searches for lepton - flavour violation ( lfv ) in tau decays are particularly topical . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "minimally augmented with massive neutrinos and neutrino oscillations , lfv decays of the tau are allowed , but at an unobservably low level  @xcite . however , various extensions to the sm predict lfv rates accessible to the b factories , with branching fractions of order @xmath9 and higher  @xcite .      belle has used 3-prong tau decays from the process @xmath10 , in a sample of 414  fb@xmath11 of data , to measure the tau mass and to put an upper limit on the relative mass difference of the two charge states of the tau  @xcite .",
    "they construct the pseudomass  @xcite , a kinematic quantity which , in the absence of initial and final state radiation , displays a sharp edge at the tau mass . by fitting the edge ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : massdiff ] ) , they obtain a mass @xmath12  mev/@xmath13 and a relative mass difference @xmath14 at the 90% confidence level ( cl ) . the measurement of the relative mass difference represents a significant improvement over the previous limit on this quantity .",
    "babar has made a preliminary measurement of the tau lifetime and the relative lifetime difference of the two charge states , using an 80  fb@xmath11 data sample .",
    "they measure a lifetime of @xmath15  fs and a relative difference , @xmath16 , of @xmath17% ( the systematic error has still to be evaluated ) .",
    "all of the measurements to date are consistent with cpt invariance and with lepton universality .",
    "belle has recently published results  @xcite@xcite on searches for the lfv decays of the tau to a lepton plus two pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath18 or k@xmath19 ) , including the cases where the mesons are decay products of a k@xmath20 , @xmath21 , k@xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "the most promising channel among these may be @xmath24 , where the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with small @xmath25 could give a branching fraction as large as @xmath26 .",
    "these decay modes may also be sensitive to new physics models with heavy dirac neutrinos and to models with dimension - six effective fermionic operators that induce @xmath27 mixing . with a data sample of 158  fb@xmath11 , belle set 90% cl upper limits that vary from @xmath28 for @xmath29 to @xmath30 for @xmath31 . using 281  fb@xmath11",
    "they obtain limits of @xmath32 for e@xmath3k@xmath20 and @xmath33 for @xmath34k@xmath20    belle has also made a search  @xcite for the decay @xmath35 putting an upper limit at @xmath36 at 90% cl .",
    "the belle results improve on previous lep and cdf exclusion limits in the @xmath25 versus @xmath37 plane .",
    "babar has recently used a data sample of 233  fb@xmath11 to search for the decay @xmath38 .",
    "in mssm with the seesaw mechanism , the branching fraction for this process is directly related to the value of @xmath25 and the mass of lightest chargino .",
    "babar excludes this process  @xcite with an upper limit on the branching fraction of @xmath39 at 90% cl .",
    "the non - strange hadronic tau decays are dominated by vector and axial hadronic states , with the vector part of the so - called spectral function being particularly important as input to the calculation of the muon magnetic moment anomaly , @xmath40 .",
    "the largest uncertainty in this calculation comes from the lowest order hadronic correction to the photon propagator , whose value is inferred from measurements of the cross section for the process e@xmath2e@xmath41 at low energies .",
    "almost three - quarters of this correction is due to the @xmath42 final state , dominated by the @xmath43 .",
    "the e@xmath2e@xmath3 annihilation data can be related , by isospin invariance ( conserved vector current ) , to the decay @xmath44 for which much higher statistics measurements are available . in principle , therefore , the tau decay data could provide more precise input for @xmath45 ; however there remains a discrepancy between the e@xmath2e@xmath3 and @xmath0 data which currently is not understood .",
    "a recent review can be found in ref .  .",
    "studies of the strange spectral functions in hadronic tau decays are the route to the world - best measurements of the ckm matrix element @xmath1 and the mass of the strange quark .",
    "all measurements to date of the strange tau decays are limited by statistics , and so the b - factory data have a very important role to play .",
    "already , the babar and belle preliminary measurements of the @xmath46 modes are more precise than the previous world averages .",
    "belle has used a sample of 72  fb@xmath11 to make a first study of their @xmath48 mass spectrum from @xmath0 decay  @xcite .",
    "they fit to the phenomenological model of gounaris and sakurai  @xcite which includes a set of three interfering @xmath21 breit - wigner amplitudes , and they find the need for a @xmath49 state in addition to the two well - known @xmath50 and @xmath51 resonances ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : belle2pi ] ) .",
    "belle reports a branching fraction bf@xmath52 .",
    "the result for @xmath53 is in agreement with previous tau measurements from aleph  @xcite and cleo  @xcite and in disagreement with the numbers deduced from the e@xmath2e@xmath3 data  @xcite .      in a recent babar analysis  @xcite ,",
    "a data sample of 232  fb@xmath11 has been used to study the process @xmath55 .",
    "the branching fraction is measured as @xmath56 , representing a significant improvement on the previous world average .",
    "the mass spectrum of the hadronic system , with all tracks taken as pions , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5pifigure1 ] , where it is compared to the output of the tauola monte carlo model  @xcite .",
    "[ fig:5pifigure2 ] shows the inclusive @xmath42 mass spectrum , indicating a significant contribution from @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath57 spectrum ( fig .  [ fig:5pifigure3 ] ) shows a signal from the f@xmath58 meson , from which the branching fraction is measured to be bf@xmath59 .",
    "these data will be used to improve the implementation of these channels in the tauola monte carlo .",
    "babar has looked for evidence for decays of the @xmath0 to seven or more pions  @xcite , which would be highly suppressed by phase space . in principle",
    ", the rate of such decays would be sensitive to the mass of the @xmath0 neutrino , but recent results on the neutrino mass differences has somewhat reduced the interest in this , since indications are that the neutrino masses are too small to be probed by high - multiplicity @xmath0 decays .    using 232  fb@xmath11 of data",
    ", babar has placed the following upper limits on branching fractions at 90% cl : @xmath62 for @xmath63 ; @xmath64 for @xmath65 ; @xmath66 for @xmath67 ; and @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "babar has made a preliminary measurement of @xmath70 with 124  fb@xmath11 of data , obtaining a branching fraction of @xmath71 .",
    "for the complementary mode , @xmath72 , belle uses 351  fb@xmath11 to measure a branching fraction of @xmath73 .",
    "the two measurements are consistent . in preliminary fits to their k@xmath74 mass spectrum , belle finds some evidence for the presence of the k@xmath75 together with a scalar state ( the so - called @xmath76 ) .",
    "each of babar and belle expects to accumulate samples of close to , or greater than , 1000  fb@xmath11 by the end of 2008 .",
    "thus there is the potential for much more @xmath0 physics in the coming years .",
    "limits on lfv could be reduced down to @xmath77 for some channels , with even the possibility of the emergence of evidence for new physics . in semihadronic decays , measurements of the strange spectral functions",
    "should provide an improved measurement of the ckm matrix element @xmath1 and perhaps also of the mass of the strange quark .",
    "measurements of the non - strange channels will include the important vector spectral functions , which should continue to aid understanding of the non - perturbative , hadronic contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon .",
    "many thanks go to the babar and belle collaborations , whose work i have reported .",
    "i would also thank the organizers of charm 2006 for what was a most enjoyable and productive workshop ."
