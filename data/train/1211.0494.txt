    "a clear understanding of the provenance of cosmic rays ( cr ) at different energetic regimes , namely their galactic or extragalactic origin , is of paramount importance in unveiling the nature of the sources of these particles , in particular at the highest energies .",
    "the observed energy spectrum of cr has an approximately power - law behavior for @xmath7 orders of magnitude in energy with several features that can be linked with particles propagation and acceleration .",
    "this power - law behavior is most probably indicative of a power - law acceleration spectra , while spectral features may be assigned to changes in the origin of particles , their propagation and acceleration .",
    "we shall consider these features starting from the highest energies .",
    "if primary particles are protons , their spectrum must show a steepening which begins at @xmath8  eev .",
    "it is the famous greisen @xcite , zatsepin and kuzmin @xcite cutoff , referred to as gzk , caused by pion photo - production energy loss in collisions of protons with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons .",
    "most probably this cutoff is already observed in the hires _",
    "( high resolution fly s eye ) _ @xcite and ta _ ( telescope array ) _",
    "@xcite data , while the spectrum steepening observed by the pao _",
    "( pierre auger observatory ) _",
    "@xcite does not agree well , according to our calculations , with the predicted gzk shape and position .",
    "an alternative to the protons as primaries is given by nuclei . propagating through astrophysical backgrounds nuclei lose their energy in photo - disintegration and pair production processes , and also due to adiabatic expansion of the universe .",
    "the steepening of nuclei spectra due to photo - disintegration in the interactions with the cmb has been shortly mentioned by greisen @xcite and later considered quantitatively in @xcite .",
    "the beginning of the steepening in this case ( nuclei in the cmb radiation only ) corresponds to the intersection of @xmath9 and adiabatic energy losses curves @xcite .",
    "the beginning of this steepening is lower than in the case of gzk cutoff and the shape of this feature differs from that of gzk .",
    "recent accurate calculations show that the pao spectrum steepening may be explained not only by nuclei interactions .",
    "it may be also produced as a result of a decreasing acceleration efficiency in the vicinity of the maximum energy that sources can provide ( @xmath10 ) ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "the hires and ta data , in favor of proton composition , and the pao data , in favor of nuclei composition , are further discussed in sections  [ sec : gzk ] and  [ sec : auger ] .",
    "there is another feature in the spectrum of uhe extragalactic protons , the _ pair - production dip _ @xcite , which , as in case of gzk cutoff , can be directly linked to the interaction of crs with the cmb .",
    "this dip arises due to electron - positron production energy loss by extragalactic protons interacting with the cmb photons : @xmath11    this feature has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the dip was observed with a very good statistical significance , @xmath12 , by the fly s eye , yakutsk , akeno - agasa and hires detectors @xcite , but it is absent in the auger data ( see section [ sec : auger ] for a more detailed analysis ) .",
    "the pair - production dip and gzk cutoff are signatures of protons .",
    "a confirmation of the shape of these features can be considered as an indirect evidence for a proton - dominated composition of primary crs . for nuclei as primaries",
    "the shapes of the dip and cutoff are strongly different .",
    "a different explanation of the dip has been proposed by hill and schramm @xcite .",
    "they interpreted the dip observed in 1980s in terms of a two - component model ; the low energy component was either galactic or produced by local supercluster .",
    "a similar model was later considered in @xcite .",
    "the hill - schramm s interpretation is widely adopted now .    from 1960s",
    "there was observed a flattening in the ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) spectrum , which was called the _",
    "ankle_. discovery of this feature at the volcano ranch detector @xcite was interpreted as the transition from a steep galactic component to a flatter extragalactic one .",
    "the ankle is clearly seen in the pao data at @xmath13  eev @xcite . in @xcite - @xcite",
    "the ankle is considered as a feature where the transition from the galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays occurs . in the dip model",
    "@xcite the ankle appears automatically as a part of the pair - production dip .    below the ankle , at @xmath14  eev , there is a faint feature in the spectrum @xcite called the _",
    "second knee_. it is seen in many experiments ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "this feature is also often interpreted as the place of transition from galactic to extragalactic crs , with the dip model @xcite being among these works .",
    "one more well known feature , the proton knee , occurs at @xmath15  pev .",
    "it was discovered by the msu ( moscow state university ) array in 1958 @xcite .",
    "the knee is most probably explained by the maximum acceleration energy for protons in the galaxy . in the framework of the rigidity - dependent acceleration model",
    "it was predicted that the iron knee is located at @xmath16 times higher energy , @xmath17 eev .",
    "this feature was confirmed by the kascade grande @xcite , so that the end of the galactic cr spectrum is naturally connected with the iron knee .",
    "based on the observational features described above , three models of the transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays have been proposed .    in the _ ankle models _",
    "@xcite - @xcite it is assumed that the transition occurs at the flat part of the observed spectrum in the energy interval @xmath18  eev . the transition energy is given by the intersection of a flat extragalactic spectrum and a very steep galactic one . in the majority of ankle models",
    "the extragalactic component is assumed to be pure proton , while the galactic one should be naturally represented by iron nuclei at energies above the iron knee .",
    "these models predict a transition from an iron - dominated composition to a proton - dominated one at the ankle energy .    in the _ mixed composition model _",
    "@xcite it is assumed that the extragalactic component consists of nuclei of various types .",
    "thus transition here occurs from iron to lighter nuclei of mixed composition ; it can occur at the ankle or nearby it .    in the _ dip model",
    "_ the transition begins at the second knee and is completed at the beginning of the dip , at @xmath19  eev .",
    "the ankle in this model appears as an intrinsic part of the dip . like in the ankle model",
    ", the transition here also occurs as an intersection of the flat extragalactic component ( this flatness is especially prominent in the case of diffusive propagation ) with a steep galactic spectrum .",
    "in contrast to the ankle and mixed composition models , the dip model predicts an almost pure proton composition above @xmath20  eev and a pure iron composition below this energy .    in this review",
    "we shall discuss recent modifications of these three basic models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ endgcr ] we briefly discuss the standard model of galactic cosmic rays , focusing in particular on the end of the spectrum , in section [ uhecr ] we discuss the spectra of cosmic rays at ultra high energy , focusing on their extragalactic origin , in section [ transition ] we analyze the models of the transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays",
    ". finally , in section [ conclusions ] we shall present our conclusions .",
    "for a long time it was assumed that supernova ( sn ) explosions may provide the observed cosmic rays .",
    "baade and zwicky @xcite in 1934 were the first who understood that sne energy release can produce enough energy to fill the milky way with the observed cosmic rays . arguing with the adherents of extragalactic origin of the observed cosmic rays , ginzburg and syrovatsky put forward a model @xcite of galactic cosmic rays ( gcr ) .",
    "its basic elements were particle acceleration by sn shocks followed by a diffusive propagation in the galactic magnetic fields , until they leave the galaxy .      in spite of some small disturbing contradictions that will be discussed later",
    ", one may claim now that the standard model for galactic cosmic rays exists ( see reviews @xcite ) .",
    "it is based on the supernova remnant ( snr ) paradigm and includes four basic elements :    1 .",
    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) as sources ; 2 .",
    "snr shock acceleration ; 3 .",
    "rigidity - dependent injection as a mechanism providing the observed cr mass composition , and 4 .",
    "diffusive propagation of crs in the galactic magnetic fields .",
    "let us discuss these elements in more detail .",
    "snrs are able to provide the observed cr energy production in the galaxy , which can be found @xcite as @xmath21 where @xmath22  ev/@xmath23 is the observed cr energy density , @xmath24 is the velocity of cr particle , @xmath25 g is the total mass of galactic gas , and @xmath26 g/@xmath27 is the grammage traversed by cr before escaping the galaxy . using these numbers one obtains @xmath28  erg / s , which is less than @xmath29 of the energy release in the form of kinetic energy of the sn ejecta per unit time .",
    ". the most efficient mechanism of diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) in snrs was discovered in 1977 - 1978 @xcite .",
    "a great progress has been reached during the last decade in the theory of acceleration .",
    "it was shown that cosmic ray streaming instability strongly amplifies magnetic fields upstream .",
    "it creates a highly turbulent field with strength up to @xmath30  g @xcite ( for recent works see @xcite ) . at each moment of the shock propagation",
    "only particles accelerated up to maximum energy @xmath31 can escape the acceleration region @xcite .",
    "as a byproduct , this solves the problem of adiabatic energy losses , since particles escaping with @xmath31 do not dwell long in the expanding sn shell .",
    "@xmath31 reaches the highest value at the beginning of the sedov phase and then diminishes due to the shock deceleration . at each moment",
    "@xmath32 the spectrum of escaping particles has a narrow peak at @xmath33 , but the spectrum integrated over time acquires a classical @xmath34 shape with a flattening at highest energies @xcite . the maximum acceleration energy estimated in the bohm regime of diffusion",
    "is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the amplified magnetic field , @xmath37 is the kinetic energy of the shell in units @xmath38  erg , @xmath39 is the upstream density of the gas and @xmath40 is the charge number of accelerated nuclei .",
    "thus for protons and iron nuclei maximum energies are @xmath41 here @xmath42 describes well the position of the proton knee and @xmath43 predicts the position of the iron one .",
    "an important result on the structure of the knee was obtained in the kascade - grande experiment @xcite .",
    "the spectra were measured separately for electron - rich showers , initiated by protons and light nuclei , and electron - poor showers , corresponding to the heaviest nuclei of the iron group .",
    "the steepening in the spectrum of electron - poor showers was found at @xmath44  pev . with electron - rich showers knee at @xmath45  pev",
    ", the heaviest nuclei knee corresponds to iron nuclei , as expected in the rigidity - dependent acceleration model .",
    "observations show that nuclei in cosmic rays are systematically more abundant than in the interstellar medium of the solar neighborhood @xcite ; this occurs due to the injection of particles in the regime of acceleration @xcite .",
    "it can be illustrated by the following simple consideration @xcite .",
    "a particle @xmath46 from downstream ( @xmath47 ) can cross the shock and thus may be injected in the regime of acceleration if its larmor radius @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the thickness of the shock front . it readily gives the relation between a nucleus and proton injection momenta @xmath50 therefore , @xmath51 , which provides a higher injection rate for nuclei .",
    "the same result may be also obtained in a more formal way .",
    "consider a flux of accelerated particles @xmath46 , @xmath52 .",
    "normalizing @xmath53 by the condition @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the density of gas @xmath46 and @xmath56 is the fraction of this density injected into acceleration process , one obtains a ratio of nuclei and proton cr fluxes @xmath57 thus , the fraction of nuclei is enhanced by a factor @xmath58 . for numerical calculations of cr nuclei abundances",
    "see @xcite .    \\4 .",
    "crs propagate in the galaxy diffusively ; they scatter off small - scale magnetic turbulence which may be described as a superposition of mhd waves with different amplitudes and random phases .",
    "this process is considered ( see e.g.  @xcite ) in the resonance approximation , when the particle giro - frequency is equal to the wave frequency in the system at rest with the particle motion along the average magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field may be considered as a combination of an average ( constant ) field , @xmath59 , and a fluctuating component , @xmath60 . in @xcite the parallel diffusion coefficient @xmath61 is calculated assuming @xmath62 ( see however numerical simulations @xcite which do not support this assumption at the highest energies ) .",
    "proton and nuclei spectra , as calculated by berezhko and vlk @xcite within sm gcr , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : b - volk ] in comparison with data .",
    "an agreement with observations is quite good at low energies , and the knee is confirmed at @xmath63  pev in proton and all - particle spectra .",
    "the iron knee located at @xmath64  pev is the most important prediction of the standard model ; this feature was confirmed by the kascade - grande detector @xcite .",
    "the spectra beyond knees are expected to be very steep .",
    "diffusive propagation is a phenomenon which currently provides problems to the standard model of galactic crs .",
    "the essence of these problems can be easily seen ( for a detailed discussion see also the papers of other authors that cover these topics in the present topical issue ) .",
    "the diffusion coefficient and its energy dependence are primarily determined by the turbulence spectrum @xmath65 , which in the most important cases is given in a power - law form @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the wave number .",
    "then one has @xmath68 with @xmath69 ,   @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the kolmogorov , kraichnan and shock wave diffusion , respectively . in the bohm regime with strong turbulence ,",

    "it is easy to verify that the space density @xmath73 of primary protons and nuclei is @xmath74 it follows from @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the generation ( acceleration ) rate of primaries , i.e.  protons and nuclei , and @xmath77 is the escape time from the galaxy .",
    "for non - relativistic diffusive acceleration @xmath78 ; hence from the index of the observed spectrum , @xmath79 , one derives @xmath80 . at very high energy",
    "this results in a too large anisotropy , @xmath81 , and in a too small traversed grammage , @xmath82 .    to solve the problem of small @xmath83 it was suggested the effect of spallation inside cr sources and re - acceleration by second order fermi mechanism during cr propagation @xcite .    concerning anisotropy",
    ", observations show its constant behavior with energy which is in contrast with the simple estimate above .",
    "this inconsistency is only apparent because the result @xmath84 refers to an average of the anisotropy amplitude computed over many source realizations , i.e. over a continuum of sources . in the framework of the sm for gcr ,",
    "the actual value of anisotropy can be computed only taking into account the random nature ( in space and time ) of nearby recent snrs @xcite .",
    "it is easy to estimate the @xmath85 ratio in the framework of sm and to compare it with the one measured in the pamela experiment @xcite .",
    "the basic difference with protons and nuclei , considered above , is that the lifetime of he electrons and positrons is much shorter than the escape time .",
    "it is given by energy losses due to synchrotron and inverse compton radiation , @xmath86 .",
    "for primary he electrons the rate of production ( acceleration ) is @xmath87 and the space density @xmath88 positrons in the sm gcr are produced as secondary particles in @xmath89 interactions of cr protons with the interstellar gas .",
    "using @xmath90 from eq.([n_p ] ) , one finds the rate of positron generation as @xmath91 the space density of positrons @xmath92 is then obtained as @xmath93 thus in the framework of the sm of gcr the ratio @xmath94 regularly diminishes with energy increasing .",
    "this simple estimate is in contrast with the observed increasing of the @xmath95 ratio in the pamela data @xcite .",
    "the sm of galactic cosmic rays faces at least two major problems .",
    "the first one is connected with the diffusion mechanism and was already discussed in the previous section [ sec : diff - estimates ] .",
    "the second one is connected with the acceleration mechanism of crs and will be discussed below . here",
    "we shall address only the contradictions of the sm of gcr with observations , demonstrating that in most cases they are only apparent .",
    "numerous subdominant phenomena , like re - acceleration , which in fact may affect the results in a noticeable way , will be omitted .    as far as _ diffusion _ is concerned , the problems arise due to the fast increase of the diffusion coefficient with energy @xmath96 , which results at high energy in a large anisotropy , @xmath97 , and in a too small traversed grammage , @xmath98 .",
    "a possible solution was mentioned in section [ sec : diff - estimates ] .",
    "it is interesting that another _ diffusion _ problem , the observation by pamela of the rise with energy in the @xmath85 ratio , may be solved within the sm @xcite ( see , however , the criticism of this model in @xcite ) .",
    "the basic idea presented in @xcite is the production of @xmath5-pairs in pp - collisions _ in situ _ ,",
    "i.e.  at the shock front .",
    "secondary positrons are immediately involved in the process of acceleration , in fact more efficiently than primary electrons , because they already have a power - law energy spectrum . as a result ,",
    "the ratio @xmath85 rises with energy .",
    "of course , there were proposed other mechanisms of positron production , e.g.  from pulsars @xcite , from dark matter annihilation etc .",
    "( see @xcite for review and references ) , but it is important that the positron excess can be successfully explained in the framework of the sm gcr .    the difference in spectrum slopes for protons and helium",
    "was considered for a long time as a serious problem for shock acceleration , which is the most important component of the sm .",
    "this difference is presented in the most precise way by the pamela experiment @xcite ; the spectrum of helium is harder .",
    "the slope difference is small , but statistically it is reliably provided , @xmath99 .    theoretically , the shock - wave acceleration does not distinguish among nuclei with equal rigidities .",
    "the predicted spectrum is a decreasing power - law with an exponent determined by the shock properties , i.e.   the mach number .",
    "however , according to pamela , spectra are not exactly power - law and the effective exponents are also different : @xmath100 and @xmath101 for protons and helium , respectively .",
    "the understanding of these phenomena needs the inclusion of particle injection in the acceleration regime and the account of the escaping particles from the accelerator .",
    "we shall follow here the paper by drury @xcite with a clear physical analysis and the works @xcite for calculations .    in the standard approach",
    "the spectrum is calculated for particles accompanying the shock front , i.e.  located within the acceleration length upstream and downstream .",
    "this spectrum differs from that of the escaping and captured particles .",
    "the latter drift downstream and are trapped there until the shock dies .",
    "they suffer adiabatic energy losses and do not contribute to the he part of the observed spectrum . for escaping particles",
    "the exit model must be specified . in section [ sm ]",
    "we considered the exit mechanism from @xcite : at each time @xmath32 particles accelerated up to maximum energy @xmath102 freely escape from the shell .",
    "the total spectrum of escaping particles may be calculated by an integration over time .",
    "the highest energy particles escape at the beginning of the sedov phase ; the lower energy ones exit progressively later .",
    "the chemical composition changes with time because swept - up gas changes its chemical composition and ionization state .",
    "it means that the energy spectrum of nuclei with fixed ( z , a ) is characterized by its own @xmath103 .    according to section [ sm ] ,",
    "injection plays a similar role .",
    "an account for propagation through interstellar medium can also result in a difference in the spectral indices of protons and helium .",
    "the observed knees are interpreted as the end of the galactic crs .",
    "positions of knees define maximum acceleration energies , different for protons and nuclei , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : xdef ] ) .",

    "soon after the discovery of dsa @xcite it was understood @xcite that the maximum acceleration energy in this approach does not exceed @xmath104  tev , much below the knee . only later after the works by bell @xcite , and bell and lucek @xcite , it was realized that an increasing of the magnetic field due to the weibel instability may enhance the maximum energy up to the needed level @xmath105  eev given by eq .",

    "the motivation for an additional component of the gcrs with @xmath10 up to @xmath106  eev is given by the interpretation of the ankle observed according to the latest data at ( 3 - 4 )  eev , as the transition from galactic to extragalactic crs at @xmath107  eev .",
    "it was proposed in @xcite that such an additional component may appear due to some unspecified sources different from snr .    a plausible idea for increasing @xmath10",

    "occurs at the ankle , see allard et al .  in @xcite",
    "however , in the conceptually important paper by allard , olinto , parizot ( 2007 ) from @xcite it was emphasized that for strong source evolution and flat generation spectra the intersection of galactic and extragalactic components occurs between @xmath195  eev and @xmath161  eev , i.e.  at the second knee , as in the dip model . the transition in this model",
    "is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : mixed_spctr ] .",
    "the transition begins at @xmath275  eev and is accomplished at @xmath240  eev .",
    "and cosmological evolution @xmath276 up to @xmath277 and with a frozen evolution at larger @xmath271 up to @xmath278 .",
    "the transition accomplishes at @xmath279  eev , i.e.  below the ankle . at highest energies",
    "the spectrum is dominated by protons ( see right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : mixed ] ) and shows the gzk cutoff , compared in the figure with hires data .",
    ", width=75 ]    the dominance of protons ( as an example see fig .  [ fig : mixed ] ) was the reason why the @xmath209 predicted by mixed composition models is in a better agreement with hires data than with pao data .",
    "the observations of pao show that mass composition becomes heavier with increasing energy , and thus the existing calculations in the framework of mixed models agree better with the hires data .",
    "however , with the recent proposal @xcite , discussed in subsection [ sec : auger ] , the power of the mixed composition model for fitting the pao data may change due to a possible enhancement of the heavy nuclei production .",
    "the transition from galactic to extragalactic crs takes place in the energy interval @xmath280 eev . and it gives a key for understanding both galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays .",
    "in its low - energy part this range includes the high - energy tail of the galactic crs .",
    "the information obtained at these energies on the galactic crs involves the maximum energy of acceleration , the chemical composition , the anisotropy and the mode of propagation in the galaxy . it may unveil the whole picture of the origin of the galactic crs .    the low - energy part of the extragalactic cosmic rays spectrum can give a key information on the existence of the pair - production dip and on the propagation of the crs in extragalactic magnetic fields",
    ".    therefore , the experimental studies in the transition region @xmath280 eev are of paramount importance in this field of research , with the mass composition measured by different methods being probably the most important task .",
    "there are four working detectors which cover partially the above - mentioned region : kascade - grande @xcite , tunka @xcite , yakutsk @xcite and icetop / icecube @xcite .",
    "there are also projects to extend the observations of telescope array and pao to low energies , @xmath281 at tale @xcite and at le - auger @xcite .",
    "the auger detector has a great potential to explore the low - energy region of the uhecr spectrum . at present",
    "there are already two new detectors at pao collecting data at this energy ; heat @xcite , high elevation auger telescope , detecting the fluorescent light at higher elevation angles ; and amiga @xcite , auger muons and infill ground array , for the detection of the eas muon component .",
    "these detectors , together with tale , tunka , yakutsk and icecube / icetop will provide information on all radiations from eas , including fluorescent and cherenkov light , muons and radio radiation .",
    "one may expect that in this way the present controversy between the mass compositions in the hires and auger detectors will be unambiguously solved .",
    "the recent measurement @xcite of the muon - production depth @xmath282 and maximum zenith angle @xmath208 by on - ground auger detectors is an important step in this direction .    at the low - energy end of the uhecr",
    "the _ energy spectra _ are measured with an unprecedented accuracy for cosmic ray physics . however , in fact even in experiments with the same technique , like hires and auger , the _ energy scales _ are different due to systematic errors ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pao - spct ] ) .",
    "such difference is more natural for different techniques , e.g.  scintillator and fluorescent ones in ta detector .",
    "the problem of the _ energy scale _ hopefully may be solved combining all observational methods .",
    "however , there is a physical standard candle for the detector energy calibration , given by the fixed energy position of the pair - production dip .",
    "the recalibration factor @xmath283 can be found by the spectrum shift to the energy at which the agreement between observed and predicted dips is the best @xcite .",
    "if the observed dip is really caused by pair - production process , the fluxes measured in all experiments must coincide .",
    "this is what we see indeed in fig .",
    "[ fig : pao - spct ] , in @xcite and in blmer at al .  @xcite .",
    "since the mass composition is expected to be different for galactic and extragalactic crs , its measurement gives a reliable way to test the transition .",
    "the best method at present to determine the cr chemical composition is given by measuring @xmath209 .",
    "unfortunately this method suffers from many uncertainties , including those in the value of fluorescent yield , absorption of uv light in the atmosphere and uncertainties in the interaction models , needed to convert the mass composition into the observed @xmath209 .",
    "systematic errors in the @xmath284 measurement can be as large as @xmath285  g/@xmath27 , to be compared with the difference of about 100  g/@xmath27 between the @xmath209 for protons and iron .",
    "a better sensitivity to distinguish different nuclei is given by the width of the @xmath209 distribution , i.e.  rms@xmath184 @xcite .",
    "the most self - consistent conclusions on the nature of the observed uhecrs are obtained at present for hires detector : it has observed both signatures of proton propagating through cmb ; namely pair - production dip and the gzk cutoff .",
    "moreover , the conclusion about protons as primaries is confirmed by the direct measurements of proton composition with the help of @xmath209 and rms .",
    "gzk cutoff is also found in the integral spectrum with characteristic energy @xmath286 , in excellent agreement with theoretical prediction @xmath287 .",
    "good agreement with the dip energy shape and with @xmath187 allow to conclude that the hires basic energy scale is correct .",
    "hires data agrees well with the dip model with agn as the sources and with cosmological evolution of agn taken from x - ray observations .",
    "the auger data are quite different .",
    "measurements of mass composition using @xmath209 and rms and confirmed by independent data of muon - production depth @xmath282 and rise - time of the signal in water - cerenkov tanks indicate nuclei as primaries with steadily increasing @xmath288 starting from 4  eev and up to 35   eev , where mass composition practically reaches pure iron . the auger mass composition , if confirmed , excludes the dip model and the observed high - energy steepening as gzk cutoff . at present",
    "there is no nuclei - based model which explains simultaneously the auger energy spectrum @xmath289 and elongation curve @xmath209 .",
    "there are three models of transition : ankle , dip and mixed composition one .",
    "they differ most notably by the energy of transition and by the mass composition of the extragalactic component .",
    "the _ ankle model _ was the first one which appeared in literature .",
    "it was proposed already in 1960s after the discovery of a flat feature , the ankle , at the volcano ranch array @xcite .",
    "the transition in this model is described in the most natural way , as the intersection of a steep ( @xmath290 ) galactic heavy - nuclei component ( iron ) with a flat extragalactic proton component with a generation spectrum @xmath291 .",
    "the transition , as calculated in different models , occurs at @xmath107  eev . to fill the gap between @xmath260   eev ( iron knee ) and @xmath247 indicated above the ankle models",
    "need a new yet unknown high energy galactic component beyond the standard model for galactic cosmic rays .",
    "recently the ankle model has been strongly disfavored by @xmath284 measured below the ankle ( see right panel of the fig .",
    "[ fig : xmax ] ) due to small @xmath181 predicted by the model .",
    "it is also disfavored by the large ( not observed ) anisotropy predicted at @xmath292  eev @xcite .",
    "the _ dip model _ is based on the pair - production dip induced in the extragalactic spectrum of protons interacting with the cmb radiation .",
    "the dip is well confirmed by the observations of hires , ta , yakutsk and agasa ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dips ] ) .",
    "the successful energy calibration of all observations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pao - spct ] as an example ) using the fixed energy position of the pair - production dip can be considered as another ( indirect ) evidence in favor of the dip model .",
    "the transition in the dip model occurs as an intersection of the steep iron galactic spectrum with a very flat extragalactic spectrum at energy @xmath293  eev .",
    "the flatness of this spectrum can be provided as a magnetic flatness in the case of diffusive propagation @xcite or due to the sources distribution over @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "a robust prediction of the dip model is the proton - dominated mass composition above @xmath185  eev .",
    "it is confirmed by the hires and ta data ; the calculated elongation curve @xmath209 is in good agreement with the bulk of data ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : xmax ] ) .",
    "however , it strongly contradicts the highest energy auger data , especially the rms(@xmath181 ) , presented in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : massau ] .",
    "the auger - hires controversy on the mass composition is a crucial point for the survival of the dip model .    in the _ mixed composition models _",
    "the presence of various nuclei is assumed in the generation spectrum of the extragalactic component .",
    "this assumption is very reasonable , because various nuclei are present in the gas where acceleration process operates .",
    "mixed composition models with a wide choice of parameters are considered in @xcite .",
    "they include different generation indices , cosmological evolution and most notably different relative abundances of nuclei at generation .",
    "however , as was explained in subsection [ mixedcomposition ] , a basic feature common to most mixed composition models is the proton dominance at the highest energies @xmath238  eev .",
    "this feature is in conflict with the auger data at these energies that shows the mass composition getting progressively heavier with energy increasing and reaching iron at @xmath206  eev .",
    "on the other hand , the mixed composition models fit reasonably well the hires and fly s eye data .",
    "the galactic spectrum at the highest energies is assumed to be iron dominated .",
    "the transition energy is a model - dependent quantity , being determined by @xmath103 and the parameters chosen for sources cosmological evolution .",
    "however , for the flat generation indices @xmath294 and a reasonable choice of the cosmological evolution , the transition energy is about 3  eev ( as an example see fig .  [",
    "fig : mixed_spctr ] ) . the elongation curve shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mixed ] changes the slope at approximately the same energy , and the mass composition evolves towards the pure proton composition . the calculated elongation curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : mixed ] agrees well above the transition with the data of hires stereo and fly s eye , though nowadays the data of hires agrees better at @xmath295  eev with a pure proton composition .",
    "much better quality of data on the @xmath209 is needed to distinguish the dip and mixed - composition models by @xmath296 measurements .    with the recent proposal @xcite for an enhancement of heavy nuclei production at the sources",
    ", the mixed - composition models may hopefully describe better the auger elongation curve @xmath209 and its rms .    as short conclusion one may state that while the ankle models of transition are severely disfavored , mostly by the @xmath209 data at @xmath297  ev , the dip and mixed composition models are in a good agreement with the @xmath209 data from the fly s eye , hires and ta detectors .",
    "the present problem is the conflict of data on mass composition between the hires and ta on one side , and the pao on the other .",
    "we do expect that problems with mass composition in the energy range @xmath298  eev , of fundamental importance to asses the transition issue , will be soon resolved with the heat , amiga , kascade - g , tale , tunka , yakutsk and icecube / icetop experiments .",
    "we are grateful to johannes knapp and sergey ostapchenko for very useful discussions and to the pierre auger collaboration for permission to use their data @xcite prior to journal publication .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for a careful reading of the paper and numerous valuable questions and corrections .",
