    "there are two basic reasons for conducting transit surveys for extrasolar planets .",
    "the first , most obvious , and most familiar , it simply to find transiting planets in order that one can perform the host of follow - up studies that are possible with these systems .",
    "such studies enable one to measure many otherwise unobservable physical properties of the planets ( see @xcite and references therein ) . as these studies are best suited to bright systems , uncovering the transiting planets orbiting the brightest host stars",
    "is the primary motivation of many wide - angle photometric surveys , as well as several radial velocity surveys .",
    "the second reason to conduct transit surveys is to constrain the frequency of short - period planets as a function of mass , radius , and period . since only @xmath0 of short - period planets",
    "transit their host stars , and the transit duty cycle is only @xmath1 , one might wonder whether it is wiser to do this using a detection method which shows a persistent signal over a larger range of inclinations , such as precision radial velocities . of course this",
    "is being done , but currently photometric surveys can probe a larger number of systems over a larger range of distances from the sun , and so can detect intrinsically rarer systems , or constrain the properties of planets in environments beyond the local solar neighborhood , such as open clusters , globular clusters , the distant galactic disk , or even the galactic bulge .",
    "proper planning and execution of transit surveys requires the ability to predict the number of planets that will be detected , given a model for the frequency and distribution of planets , the properties of the survey , and the detection criteria .",
    "conversely , these predictions are required in order to use observed detection rates from completed surveys to infer the intrinsic frequency and distribution of planets . here",
    "i review efforts to accomplish these two related goals , both of which generally require realistic simulations of transit surveys .",
    "one can broadly divide the methods of predicting planet yields into two categories . the first category , which i will call reverse ( or _ a posteriori _ ) modeling , uses the known properties of an observed sample of stars around which one is searching for planets to calibrate the survey efficiency . the second category , which i will call forward ( or _ ab initio _ ) modeling , uses assumed distributions of the stellar and planetary properties to statistically predict the ensemble properties of the target stars and the detection efficiency of the survey as a whole .",
    "these two methods have different advantages and drawbacks , and their relative usefulness depends on the context in which they are applied .    in the reverse approach ,",
    "one attempts to model , as accurately as possible , the total detection probability of each individual star in the survey sample .",
    "the expected number of detections is then just the sum of the detection probabilities over all the stars in the survey .",
    "for example , given a known mass @xmath2 and radius @xmath3 for each star @xmath4 , one can determine the individual transit probabilities @xmath5 .",
    "these stellar properties can be combined with the properties of the survey observations ( cadence , photometric uncertainties , correlations ) to determine the detection probability for each star @xmath6 .",
    "then , assuming a distribution @xmath7 of planets as function of period @xmath8 and planet radius @xmath9 , the ( differential ) number of expected planet detections , @xmath10 , is given by , =",
    "_ k p_tr , k(m_k , r_k , p ) p_det , k(m_k , r_k , r , p ) .",
    "[ eqn : nback ]    the advantage of the reverse approach is that it is more accurate and accounts for poisson fluctuations in the individual stellar properties .",
    "the disadvantage is that it requires knowledge of the properties of the individual stars .",
    "this is relatively straightforward to obtain for surveys toward stellar systems such as globular or open clusters , but can be quite difficult to obtain for field surveys , for which the physical properties of the individual stars are poorly constrained due to their unknown distances and foreground extinction .",
    "furthermore , the reverse approach is not generally applicable for predicting the expected yields of future surveys .    in the forward approach , one dispenses with any hope of modeling the detection probabilities of the stars individually , but rather attempts to construct statistical distributions of the stellar properties , and use these to predict the ensemble detection probability of the stars in the survey .",
    "the average number of planets that a transit survey should detect is the product of the differential stellar density distribution along the line - of - sight ( @xmath11 ) , the distribution of planets ( @xmath7 ) , the transit probability , and the detection probability : = p_tr(m , r , p ) p_det(m , r , l , r , p ) ^2 .",
    "[ eqn : dngen ] here @xmath12 is the stellar luminosity , @xmath13 is the distance along the line - of - sight , and thus @xmath14 represents the volume element .    of the ingredients that enter into ,",
    "the detection probability is one of the most critical and must be specified with care . in particular , the detection probability must account for _ all _ selection cuts that are employed in the actual surveys , such as cuts on parameters output from transit - finding algorithms and sde parameters in the bls algorithm @xcite . ] , the number of transits , the source color and magnitude , and the radial velocity precision ( as used for confirmation ) .",
    "when comparing the predictions of surveys to results from completed experiments , the cuts _ must _ be applied consistently in the data and the model , otherwise any inferences are highly suspect .",
    "this can be particularly difficult when trying to model any ` by - eye ' cuts .",
    "the forward approach is well - suited to the planning of future surveys , and field surveys where the masses and radii of the individual stars are not known .",
    "the drawback of the forward approach is that it is less exact , requires considerably more input assumptions , and is sensitive to uncertainties in these assumptions .",
    "one can improve the accuracy of the forward approach by adopting a hybrid method in which one imposes external observational constrains on the model .",
    "for example , one of the most important indicators of the expected number of detections is simply the total number of stars being surveyed .",
    "therefore , observed number counts of stars as a function of magnitude and color can be used to constrain the parameters of the forward model and so make the predicted yields more reliable .",
    "the previous discussion notwithstanding , at first glance transit surveys appear fairly straightforward , and the requirements for detecting a transiting planet may seem reasonably clear . given that the transit probability for short - period planets is @xmath15 , given that transits are expected to have a depth of @xmath16 , and given that the frequency of short period planets is known to be @xmath17 , then one might expect the number of detected events to be ~f p_tr n_1% ~10 ^ -3 n_1% , , [ eqn : nsimp ] where @xmath18 is the number of surveyed stars with photometric precision better than @xmath19 .",
    "early estimates of the yield of transit surveys varied in complexity , but generally centered around this extreme simplification of .",
    "this estimate would imply that one would need to monitor only @xmath20 stars with @xmath21 for a duration of @xmath22 in order to detect a transiting planet .",
    "in fact , results from successful surveys imply that the number of stars that must be monitored is closer to @xmath23 , depending on the survey",
    ".    why does this simple estimate fail ?",
    "there are many reasons , but the most important include the following : ( 1 ) a large fraction ( often the majority ) of the stars in the field are either giants or upper main - sequence stars that are too large to enable the detection of transits due to jupiter - sized planets @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) 1% photometry is not a sufficient requirement for detecting a transit , one typically needs to exceed some sort of signal - to - noise ratio @xmath24 requirement .",
    "the  in turn depends on the depth of the transit , the photometric accuracy , and the number of points taken during transit .",
    "furthermore , uncertainties in ground - based photometry can be correlated on the typical time scales of transits , thereby reducing the statistical power of the data @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) one generally requires several transits for detection , which when combined with the small duty cycle of the transits and losses in single - site observations , can result in a substantial suppression of the number of planets detected .",
    "( 4 ) magnitude - limited radial velocity surveys are more biased toward metal - rich ( and so planet - rich ) stars than @xmath25-limited transit surveys .",
    "therefore the frequency of planets is likely to be substantially smaller than 1% for the typical stars monitored in transit surveys @xcite .      one key point that must be addressed when",
    "simulating transit surveys is what it means to ` detect ' a transiting planet .",
    "typically transit surveys use a number of criterion to select transit - like features from observed light curves , but most trigger on some variant of a @xmath25 criterion parameter in the bls search algorithm @xcite is often used to select the best transit candidates , and is closely related to the @xmath25 . ] . for uncorrelated noise , the @xmath25 is approximately given by , n_tr^1/2 , [ eqn : sngen ] where @xmath26 is the total number of points in transit . under simple assumptions ( poisson - noise limited photometry of the source ,",
    "no extinction , random sampling ) this can be written in terms of physical parameters as @xcite , [ r^2 p^-1/3 ] ^-1 .",
    "[ eqnsnprop ] given a minimum @xmath27 , one can invert this equation to determine the distance @xmath28 out to which one can detect a given planet orbiting a given star .",
    "the expected number of planets detected around a uniform population of stars is @xcite , ~ n p_tr _ max^3 , [ eqn : nave ] where @xmath29 is the volume density of stars , and @xmath30 is the area of the field - of - view . at a limiting @xmath25 , it is then relatively straightforward to show that , p^-5/3r^6 ( ) _ min^-3 .",
    "[ eqn : navescale ] although trivial to derive , this expression has profound implications for transit surveys . for example , it implies that @xmath25-limited transit surveys are @xmath31 times more sensitive to planets with @xmath32 than planets with @xmath33 .",
    "this effect alone largely explains why the first planets uncovered by transit surveys had periods that were shorter than any found in radial velocity surveys @xcite .",
    "also , the extremely strong scaling with planet radius , @xmath34 , implies that transit surveys will always detect the extreme , bloated planets first ; this bias must be properly considered when interpreting the radius distribution of observed planets @xcite .",
    "finally , the number of detected planets is expected to be a strong function of the limiting @xmath25 , and thus survey teams must carefully specify their @xmath25 limit in order to assess their expected yield .",
    "this is not necessarily trivial because , although they may initially use automated cuts with rigid thresholds to select candidates , subsequent rejection of candidates by visual inspection imposes a higher ( and more difficult to model ) @xmath25 threshold .",
    "a number of groups have used transit surveys to measure or constrain the frequency of short - period giant planets based on the results of completed surveys .",
    "the majority of these studies have focused on cluster environments , where it is easier to determine the properties of the target stars .",
    "the first such study was the now - famous hst survey of 47 tuc @xcite , which found no transiting planets and used this null result , combined with an estimate of the survey efficiency , to demonstrate that the frequency of short - period planets was more than an order of magnitude smaller than in the local solar neighborhood .",
    "this conclusion was confirmed and strengthened by @xcite , who further argued that metallicity was the likely cause for this difference in the planet population .",
    "a number of groups have searched for planets in open clusters , without success .",
    "several of these groups have calibrated their detection efficiencies and used these to place weak constraints on frequency of short - period planets in these systems @xcite .",
    "few groups have attempted to use the results from field surveys to constrain the frequency of short period planets .",
    "as mentioned previously , field surveys are complicated by the fact that the source stars are located at a range of distances and suffer from a range of extinctions , and therefore the relevant parameters of the target stars ( e.g. their radii and mass ) are not known simply from their observed fluxes and colors . because of this , forward modeling provides the best method of estimating the efficiencies of field surveys .",
    "-magnitude ( * bottom left * ) .",
    "the solid lines are for uncorrelated uncertainties , the dashed - dot line is for uncertainties correlated at the @xmath35 level .",
    "the location of the stars tres-1 and -2 are also shown .",
    "tres-2 lies within lyr1 , while tres-1 is in the nearby lyr0 field . from @xcite.[fig :",
    "tres],width=283 ]    in a comprehensive study , @xcite modeled the expected yield of the first two campaigns of the ogle transit survey @xcite , taking careful account of the survey selection effects , and using a detailed model for the population of source stars .",
    "they then used the five planets detected in the ogle survey to infer that the fraction of stars with planets is @xmath36 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 , consistent with the results from rv surveys .",
    "they noted , however , that magnitude - limited rv surveys are biased toward metal - rich ( and so planet - rich ) stars , while transit surveys are not , therefore one would generally expect to find a deficit of planets in transit surveys in comparison to rv surveys .",
    "@xcite also demonstrated that the sensitivity of the ogle surveys declined rapidly for @xmath40 , indicating that little can be said about the frequency of sub - jovian sized planets .",
    "several authors have developed models of the expected yields of transit surveys , with various levels of complexity .",
    "@xcite derived a simple analytic expression for the yields of pencil - beam transit surveys and applied this to several ongoing projects , whereas @xcite presented and applied the formalism for estimating the yields of all - sky surveys .",
    "@xcite developed a model to predict the number of detected planets in surveys of stellar systems ; this was significantly extended and improved upon by @xcite .",
    "@xcite included , for the first time , expectations for the rates of false alarms as well , and @xcite used a detailed model to estimate and compare the potential of several space - based and ground - based surveys .",

    "figure [ fig : tres ] shows predictions for the number of transiting planets detected by the tres survey @xcite toward one of their target fields in lyra , assuming the frequencies of giant planets from @xcite .",
    "the field center , number of observations , and photometric errors were taken from the tres websiteftod / tres / sleuthobs.html ] .",
    "for this field , @xmath48 detections are expected for planets with @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 , assuming uncorrelated noise . assuming noise correlated at the level of @xmath52 , the number of detections generically drops by a factor of @xmath53 . over the @xmath54 tres fields which have been exhausted for planets ,",
    "a total of @xmath55 detections are expected in this model .",
    "this compares reasonably well with the actual yield of two detections",
    ". the remaining discrepancy could be because correlated noise is important , or the effective @xmath25 is higher .",
    "table [ tab : tres ] shows the number of detections as a function of the limiting .",
    "for example , for @xmath56 , the number of detections drops to @xmath57 .",
    "this further demonstrates the important point that , in order to use the observed yield of tres ( or any other transit survey ) to infer the frequency of short period planets , it is essential to accurately characterize the limiting detection threshold .    one important ingredient that is missing in most of the previous simulations is the ability to predict the rate of false positives , including grazing eclipsing binaries , unrelated blends , and hierarchical triples .",
    "the rates for these astrophysical false positives are expected to be even higher than the rate of bona fide planet detections .",
    "the one exception is the detailed model of @xcite , however this model did not include some of the important effects considered by others , such as density variations due to galactic structure or a @xmath25 detection criterion .",
    "a more sophisticated model that incorporates all the relevant effects is needed .",
    "one difficulty with trying to understand the trends that are emerging among the population of transiting planets is simply the small size of the sample .",
    "ideally , one would like to be able to subdivide the sample and ask , e.g. , how the trends depend on the mass of the primary star .",
    "for such analyses , a sample size of a least hundred transiting planets will be required .",
    "this an order of magnitude larger than the number of transiting planets known today .",

    "there are @xmath60 such planets over the whole sky down to @xmath61 .",
    "unfortunately , current wide - field surveys are unlikely to survey a sufficient fraction of the sky to detect more than few dozen of these , given that the most ambitious of these projects only monitor @xmath62 of the sky .",
    "increasing the number of known transiting planets by an order of magnitude will likely require a fundamentally different approach , or at least a significant upgrade to the current experiments .",
    "plans are being made to this end , but it is interesting to ask what the potential is to detect transiting planets in the large scale synoptic surveys that are being currently being built or planned ( and that are _ not _ specifically designed to detect transiting planets ) .",

    "this can be difficult , since in some cases the relevant parameters of the experiments have not been finalized .",
    "however , we can make a crude estimate by combining the predictions from figure [ fig : allsky ] with a rough estimate of the limiting magnitude of the survey .",
    "assume a given setup with diameter @xmath64 can achieve a ( source - noise limited ) precision of @xmath65 on a star with @xmath66 with an exposure time of @xmath67 .",

    "predictions are shown for both sun - like stars and m dwarfs ( which can be detected to much fainter magnitudes because the transit depths are larger ) .",
    "the potential of sdss - ii and the nominal pan - starrs survey are small , due primarily to the fact they are targeted toward the galactic poles and are very deep , and so ` run up ' against the finite galactic scale height . on the other hand ,",
    "a wider pan - starrs survey spending the same amount of time would detect at least twice as many planets .    the greatest potential comes from lsst , which could detect as many as @xmath76 transiting short - period planets around sun - like stars , and @xmath77 transiting planets around m - dwarfs , assuming the frequency of short - period planets around m - dwarfs is the same as for sun - like stars . of course",
    ", culling all of these planets poses enormous challenges . simply identifying the transiting planets themselves will be difficult , due to the large number of trial periods that must be searched given the @xmath78 duration of observations .",
    "more worrisome , however , is the fact that these detections will likely be associated with a much larger number of astrophysical false positives .",
    "the large number of expected candidates , combined with the fact that the majority of the candidates will be quite faint ( @xmath79 ) , implies that it will be difficult to follow up every candidate individually to exclude false positives .",
    "clearly much work needs to be done to realize the potential of large scale synoptic surveys for the detection of transiting planets .",
    "the first step is to provide detailed simulations of the yield of these large surveys .",
    "these simulations must include predictions for false positives , in order to determine their expected contribution , as well as identify observable trends that distinguish these astrophysical backgrounds from the signal due to the planet population of interest .",
    "then , it needs to be determined whether methods can be devised to use these trends to reliably separate the false positives from the bona fide transiting planets , and so enable one to construct a statistical sample of short - period transiting planets .",
